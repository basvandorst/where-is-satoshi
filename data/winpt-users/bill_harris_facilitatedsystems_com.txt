Thanks for pointing this out again; I missed the original posting.  When you get to 1.0, I'll probably blog about it and enter it into my
list at   I didn't take the time to download it to read the instructions, but I
have 2 suggestions.  First, what about posting Gpg4win f?r Einsteiger
and Gpg4win f?r Durchblicker at your top-level page so people can see it
before they take the time to install it?  Second, I've got a few links
at  you might find
useful, if they're not already included in the documentation.  In
particular, I might suggest mentioning Diceware.
Vielen Dank f?r Ihre Leistung!

Thanks for the update.  I certainly understand the need to prioritize.
If I had the time and the skill, I'd help out with the coding, but I
lack both (I'm focusing on J, and I don't think you use J in WinPT!).
Rest assured your work is used.  I sign almost all of my email, and I
encrypt a few (I'd do more, but I know few others who do).  I suspect
we'll still be here when you get time to come back.
Thanks again,

Is that true?  One could set up a free Wiki on
 or the like and see what happens.  I suspect
that individuals might take it upon themselves to be gardeners, to tend
the area so that it's useful.

I'm not the programmer you need to keep WinPT alive, even if I had the
time, but I wanted to say that I continue to use WinPT and do thank you
for your efforts to make it a very useful tool for me.

Timo, all,
I wanted to say thank you for what you've done over the years.  I'm now
on Linux, so I don't use WinPT anymore, but I used it (and blogged about
it a couple of times) for a number of years, and I found it a very nice
way to deal with that aspect of security on Windows.  I'm not in a position to help, unfortunately.
Best wishes,
