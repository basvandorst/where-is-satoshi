Misc thoughts on the latest version (1.0.0pre1).  Take them as you will, some are personal preferences and might not work for everyone:
- The main WinPT key manager window does a much better job of sizing its columns then the previous one.  Well, mostly...  I'm using a laptop with 123ppi.  I'm using normal-sized fonts (Display Properties, Settings) but under Advanced, General, I have the DPI setting to "Large size 120 dpi" which scales all of the fonts up by 25%.
Now that main WinPT window remembers the column widths I can finally set the columns and not worry about it anymore.
- The key edit dialog, OTOH, doesn't save the column widths and doesn't do a good job on my system of guessing the widths.  For example, the C/S/E/A columns show up as "*..".
- I wish the key edit dialog could be resized.  Once I collect a few UserIDs and new encryption keys (we create new encryption keys every 2-4 years with expirations) the dialog gets a little crowded and I have to scroll up/down to see all of the keys or user IDs.
- Is there a way to put tooltips on the Key Edit dialog columns to remind me what the various columns mean?  Specifically the C/S/E/A columns (since the help button only displays a short-hand list of what the commands do).
Alternately, maybe a text area in the lower-left portion of the dialog with context sensitive help.  As you mouse-over the various controls this text could change to indicate what you are looking at.  Or maybe that text area could be used to explain what the currently selected command does.
- On the key edit dialog, the OK button is confusing where it is currently placed.  It should probably be moved up next to the Command listbox(?) control to indicate that it works in conjunction with those - Is there a way to list PhotoIDs in the Key Edit dialog?  (Does that even make sense?)  On one of my keys, I managed to get (2) PhotoIDs attached and I think I have to go into the command-line GPG in order to fix it.
- When changing the password for a key, is it a security feature that you have to enter the old password, then enter the new password twice before finding out that you entered the wrong old password?  (Instead of entering the old password, finding out you got it wrong before being asked to type the new password twice.)
(Or is this related to how WinPT interfaces with GnuPG?)
- The only way to get the WinPT preferences is via the system tray menu, there's no menu command inside of the Key Manager window.  And vice-versa, I can only get to the GPG configuration file via the Key Manager window and not the Preferences menu on the System Tray icon. Seems like I should be able to get to all 3 preference / config files from both locations.
I'm still exploring the rest of the interface, we're pretty happy with it so far.  One big advantage with WinPT is the Key Edit dialog that shows the GnuPG commands.  That works very well for me instead of having to explain the commands needed to work with the keyring on the commandline to our users.

Thanks for taking those under consideration.
A few more for the wishlist:
- A hotkey to bring up the key manager window (Ctrl-Alt-M or Ctrl-Alt-K?)  I have so many icons down in the system tray that WinPT gets shoved into the inactive area and it can be a pain to go fishing for it.  Maybe hotkeys for the Card Manager and File Manager windows as - A hotkey to clear cached passphrases
- A hotkey to bring up the Clipboard Editor window
- At some point (v2?) a re-worked configuration for hot-keys where I can pick which actions I want a hotkey for, which ones I don't and what the hotkeys should be.  For instance, I may decide that I don't want to use the current-window hotkeys at all.  Or I may only want to assign hotkeys for encrypt/decrypt but not signing.
- Buttons / menu items on the various windows (Key Manager, File Manager, Card Manager, Clipboard Editor) to allow easy access to the other windows.  Easier then fishing around in my system tray for the WinPT icon.
- Buttons on the Clipboard Editor window to encrypt/decrypt what is showing (rather then using the hotkeys).
- The "Encryption" window where I pick which keys to encrypt to does not remember column widths.  It would also be nice if I could resize this window (and have it remember that as well).
- It would be nice if the clipboard editor window was resizable and remembered its location.
