Hi Timo,
quoting Timo Schulz, [23.03.2006 21:10]:
In my case, the registry entries are ok and WinPt ist working properly
(also enigmail), but the field for the home path is empty and remains
empty even if i enter the correct path ...

I didn't try to change the location. I wondered wether this field must
not be empty. So I entered the correct path using the browse button.
If I open the dialog again, the field is empty again.
