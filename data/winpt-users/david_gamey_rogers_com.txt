@_subject: [Winpt-users] Various errors/bugs from attempt to decrypt a file 
I recently ran into a odd set of circumstances and
errors  during a correspondance.
A contact using PGP version 8.1 sent me an encrypted
and signed attachment.  As I understand it he went to
encrypt to my key (and also his so he could show later
what he sent).  Apparently, he selected but did not
confirm my key, so it went under just his key.
I have gpg/winpt 1.4.2/0.10.1.
I could not verify the signature.  And when I tried to
decrypt the file, I saw an invalid packet error.  The
key manager window would no longer open (previously
reported phantom window problem).  A reboot is not sufficient to correct the problem.
A reinstall of WinPT and reboot was needed to get the
Key Manager window back.
Another attempt to decrypt the file, resulted in a
missing secret key message for a key ID that I did not
recognize.  The KM phantom window problem returned.
The file was reencrypted, resent, and correctly
decrypted.  Another reinstall will be needed to fix the phantom
window problem.
It would seem that trying to decrypt a file not sent
to you will result in the KM becoming unavailable.

should have
1.  While verifying the pgpgpile with the asascile, On v0.10.4 Signature made ... using DSDSAey ID ... BAD
On v0.10.1 I bebelieve got a packet error
2. Decrypting the pgpgpile
On v0.10.4 ... Encrypted with ELELGey, .... Decryption
failed: secret key not available
On v0.10.1 there was a packet error Done. As noted the packet errors seem to be gone.
Didn't see this.  Does this affect just
clipboard/ininliner are detached files affected?
I've had messages on the problem of phphantomindows
and key manager not opening before on the list.  I
bebelievehe last time was within 60 days before the
move to wawaldI've no idea why this happens but a
dedeinstalleinstall fixes it.
I thought the packet error might be a clue to the
v0.10.4 exexhibitshe phantom window problem as well.

I encountered a missing key error trying to verify files from WinPT.org.
I downloaded all the files signatures and keys.
gpg4win-1.0.5.exe.sig doesn't verify due to a missing key 0x1CE0C630

There was no automatic attempt to fetch the keys that I saw.
I tried opening the key server dialog from key manager and ran a search on the id (below).  Search produced a "could not connect to the host" error.  However, I was able to receive the key from the http host.

Marcus Brinkmann are responsible for signing this file.
Please fetch there keys to verify the integrity. But WinPT
should offer to fetch the keys from the keyserver, otherwise
there is a problem in the code.

This was the older version, as I hit the missing key problem upgrading.  This is fixed now.
-   WinPT is allowed out on those ports.
-   The http key retrieval was run after launching key manager and     selecting the keyserver menu beside file ...
    There was an ldap, an http, and several hkp servers.
-    My difficulty with search was my error, it works if I can connect
-    The only host in this dialog I can connect with is the http server,     ldap says not implemented and none of the hkp servers connected
I may not be able to look at the problem for several days to see if it repeats.
The automatic key retrieval is interesting.
In the WinPT Intro PDF file, there is a paragraph about personal
firewalls and WinPT. If there is no autmatic rule system, WinPT
might not be allowed to connect to the internet.
In general it's a good idea to allow the proces outbound connections
to port 80, 11371.
But I will check this.
With WinPT http import?
