@_subject: [Winpt-users] Unable to Verify detached signatures with 0.11.3 
i get 'instant' verification, of detached signatures,
using filemanager,
on an ancient pentium 360
with 192 ram running nt 2k pro
(a spare box at work that no one else wanted,
but very useful as a test system)
it never had gnupg or winpt before,
and after installing 1.4.2 and 0.11.3
*everything* seems to work well so far
have had many problem before with different winpt versions,
but always when they were updating over a previous version,
even though i did a search for all the ptd.dll and removed them and then installed the new winpt
maybe others with 'first time' winpt installation can confirm the 'no problems' ?

@_subject: [Winpt-users] What is the format of the passphrase stored. 
this symmetrically 'encrypted' part is stored in the secret key,
but as an an encryption of the secret key, not as a passphrase
only the 'right' passphrase unlocks the symmetric encryption,
and allows the secret key to be used,
as an illustration,
here is a test key : wpttk at key.test
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.5 (MingW32) Comment: rsa 1024 test key
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
here is the secret key, with a passphrase encrypting it:
-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.5 (MingW32)
Comment: passphrase: wpttk
-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
here is the secret key with _no_ passphrase:
-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.5 (MingW32)
Comment: no passphrase, secret key un-encrypted
-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
save both of these private key blocks, and run gpg --list-packets
and compare the results:
i save the one with the secret key, as v:\wpttkSK.asc
and the one without the passphrase as v:\wpttkSKNP.asc
here is a comparison of the gpg --list-packet outputs:

they are encrypted, and unavailable
in a sense,

that the symmetrically encrypted packet
uses specifically that passphrase as the key to decrypt it

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Announcement for WinPT 0.11.5 
i *think* i may have found the source of the problem,
would like to ask others here to try and confirm
i installed gnupg 1.4.2 and winpt 0.11.5  on a system (win 2k pro)that has never had either, and everything worked perfectly well
i used the default install, specifying only that (1)gnupg be installed into c:\gnupg
(2)winpt be installed into c:\wpt
i then tried to install 0.11.5 on my workstation (same win 2k pro as above) that already had 1.4.2 and 0.11.x and winpt would not even load, but generated an error message and the last version that worked was one of the earlier 0.11.(1 or 2, don't remember exactly)
the explanation turned out to be in Timo's answer:
On Wed, 18 Jan 2006 09:55:19 -0500 Timo Schulz  just i suspect that the 'test environment' on Timo's system is the one  with the default home directory
winpt 0.11.5 automatically makes the gnupg home directory
c:\Documents and Settings\user]application data\gnupg
because this is the default directory that gnupg uses in the 1.4.2 windows installer (independent of where gnupg itself is installed)
on a default install, everything works perfectly,
and when clicking on the winpt icon in the tray, and then 'preferences' and GPG,
the winpt 'GnupG Preeferences' window opens'
and displays the home directory as c:\Documents and Settings\user\application data\(can't see the rest of the line)
here is where i think the problem is:
the line is greyed out and does not allow for changing the home and when 0.11.5 is installed on a system where the home directory is, anything else, as for example, c:\gnupg
then the problem happens, and winpt will not even start
a simple way to confirm this on a test environment,
is to set a different home directory for gnupg by specifying it in  and then try installing winpt, and confirming the problem
a possible solution, would be to have winpt prompt for the home directory upon installation
(it could still list the same default as now, just show the 'GnuPG Preferences' screen during the installation and allowing the user to change the home directory if necessary)
on my work systems,
i don't have access to regedit
so would like to ask for independent confirmation of the above,

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Crash when deleting a key 
cannot reproduce this on win2k
was able to delete all key types v3, v4, and DH/DSA
without any problems from winpt (0.11.8)
(the only thing i can think of that *might* cause a problem, but i haven't tried,
is if the key that is being deleted is the only keypair present,
or the default key)

@_subject: [Winpt-users] gpg.conf truncation 
you are correct,
i checked the file size in word and 'formatted' it was much bigger
i can confirm what you wrote,
if a large size file is saved from winpt/key manager/edit/preferences/gpg options
and then winpt is closed, and then re-opened,
then the options file is truncated in winpt
if the options are saved by opening gpg.conf directly from notepad,
and pasted in, and saved,
then this is *not* truncated in winpt
here is the entire verbose 'options' list, (70_kb_ of text)
saved this way as an addition to gpg.conf
and winpt has no problems with it
could people try it both ways:
[1] pasting it directly in winpt and saving it
[2] pasting it from notepad and saving it
and checking for truncation

============================== START ==============================
On Mon, 15 Oct 2007 17:17:34 -0400 Timo Schulz  a simple workaround, is to remove the passphrase using pgp, and then import it into gnupg, and them make a new passphrase using whatever algorithm the user prefers
once imported into gnupg, v3 keys can use 'any' hash algorithm to sign with i still have and use my original v3 pgp 2.x key,
as it is the one most trusted by some of the people i correspond with
