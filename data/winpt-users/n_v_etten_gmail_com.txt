Hi Timo and users,
Recently i installed Windows Server 2003 X64 with WinPT, ever since i get
errors on all sides, encrypting works but decrypting often fails (not all
the time) using PSI ( i cant use GPG at all.
also winpt tray icon wont start..
Are these problems related to the incompatibility of WinPT on X64 systems?
or is it just my configuration that has problems?
Kind regards
                   Nick

I'm using a AMD Athlon64 CPU, i've worked with server 2003 (32bit) before
the reinstall, and gpg/winpt always worked fine, so it's no limitation ofthe
OS i think we can assume, i'll try to mail some detailed errors when im off
