@_subject: [Winpt-users] documentation about winpt and a wiki idea 
Just thought I'd let you know in case it could be of use :)
I have the domain WinPT.eu and also plenty of hosting space and bandwidth.
A wiki can be installed on the domain very easily and hosting.
At the moment I have WinPT listed in my freeware section with the following pdf files and these are converted to html for www viewing:
What's WinPT: WinPT Handbook: WinPT FAQ: Also the .exe install file of WinPT.
All this can easily be moved to WinPT.eu along with a Wiki like I said.
Does someone else want to manage the domain ...etc if I provide you with a login name ...etc and this goes for the email, you have complete access to the domains email and webspace.
