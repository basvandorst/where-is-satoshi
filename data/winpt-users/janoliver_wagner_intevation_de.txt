@_subject: [Winpt-users] key-server: why no standard set by default? 
============================== START ==============================
I wonder why there is no keyserver set as standard when
opening the keyserver dialog.
Also, after setting a standard and re-opening the dialog,
the selection is gone.
Is there a particular reason for this behaviour?
Is it a bug?

Hello Alan,
although Timo answered most of the questions, I'd like to add
some more info about ideas behind gpg4win.
Hope it is helpful to understand the gpg4win projects' intention.
BTW: The new website is there, see  ;-)
gpg4win installer is close to 1.0 stable release, but next 0.7.0
will come with one of the last missing modules (a second german
If EudoraGPG related license question get positively answered
within this month, 0.8.0 will contain EudoraGPG. If not, 1.0 will
come a bit earlier and not contain EudoraGPG.
I'd say its stable and usable enough to give it a try ;-)
Just wait for the next announcement where the upcoming WinPT
release will be included. The installer allows to select the modules you want to install.
Brief descriptions are given.
Yes, there is overlap of functionality between WinPT and GPA and
between WinPT and GPGee.
gpg4win includes all sensible tools around GPG. The user has
the choice (and yes, the burden of choice :-).
Especially GPA was traditionally in there (see the old GnuPP installer)
and the german handbooks refer to it. Simply lack of time. We had to draw a line for gpg4win 1.0 corresponding
to the budget we have for this.
It is surely a good idea to add GPGRelay to gpg4win later on.
Or perhaps someone here volunteers to add it right away? ;-) Well, these products share at least the Crypto-Codebase.
In fact, in the frame of gpg4win project, WinPT was changed to
use GpgME, the standard API for GnuPG. Also GPA uses it.
So far, gpg4win simply ships 'all' the keymanagers and the user
may choose the one he/she already knows.
I guess it will be difficult to create the universal keymanager.
Good idea. However, I did not evaluate Enigmail installer for Windows
yet. They are not available from the above site.
(I must confess, I am not a Thunderbird user, so my experience with
it and Enigmail is very low)
It depends on the developers behind the various key managers.
If they like to coordinate, then you might get where you want.
My guess is that only a cross-platform approach could win the race.

Indeed it is planned to put the pdf and a html-version of the two handbooks
onto   Will be done for the final 2.0.0 releases.
I only had a quick glance at the Diceware homepage, but it seems
it is a proprietary product. I dont' think the authors of the handbooks
want to recommend proprietary products.

looks good.
IMHO the main page just misses one fact: WinPT is for Microsoft Windows
operating systems ;-)
Are the web site sources managed in SVN?
Wald allows an easy way to manage web site updates for people
with SVN access. Just like for gpg4win where we have something
like "make online".

@_subject: [Winpt-users] eudora and gpg 
as a matter of fact, gpg4win project just decided to drop EudoraGPG
from the supported modules because some Eudora licenses are
incompatible with the one of EudoraGPG.
Some more infos on this will be posted this week to gpg4win mailing

whats also possible is to have  as VHOST configured
on the GForge system.  Then it would be possible to easily
update the web pages with a developer account for WinPT.

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Status of the Project 
anything of WinPT hosted at the GForge server will remain
up and working.
So, WinPT can be even picked up any time later on.
If there is no developer raising hand, maybe someone
likes to take over the administrative tasks like caring for
Mailing lists and forums.
Else, there will be no administation at all.
This does not mean the infrastructure stops working.
But e.g. emails to the mailing list that are sent with wrong "from
address" would be eliminated instead of moderated.
