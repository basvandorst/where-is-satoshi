@_subject: [Winpt-users] Unable to Verify detached signatures with 0.11.3 
Or with 0.11.1 or 0.11.2.
Does work ok with 0.10.1, which is what I am using at the moment.
What happens is:
1. Open File Manager window.
2. Drag and drop the detached sig file into the window.
3. Verify
4. Result is blank.
5. File Manager is now dead and crashes out WinPT with Dr. Watson soon
For 10.1 I have GnuPg 1.4.2.  For 0.11.3 I also used GnuPG 1.4.2
Then I also tried it after using the 0.11.3 graphic installer, to install
GnuPT directories with 0.11.3 and GnuPG 1.4.3.
Environment is Windows XP Home Media Edition

[* See comments *]
[* When it works for me (with 0.10.1) a File Verify window is displayed
which lists the file name, signature info and if the sig is ok or not.
 With 0.11.3 the File Verify window is displayed but there is nothing listed
below the column headings.  I can click OK to close the window, but now the
File Manager is not responding and Dr Watsons soon after
[* I will try and send one over later today or tomorrow *]

The file I am checking is winpt-0.11.3-exe.zip, and its corresponding .sig.
Size is 382K, with 0.10.1 it's quick.
Yes.  Cleared out the directory, extracted from the 11.3 zip and
copied the files into the directory.
Directory structure is   c:\program files\WinPT
GNUPg is in c:\program files\WinPT\Gnupg and is version 1.4.2.
Can't get it do Dr Watson at the moment, but the File Manager and File
Verify screens are still givine "Not Responding" in Task Manager.  I
will try a few more times to see if I can get a Dr Watson log.

The issue I was having with earlier 0.11.* versions, where WinPT would
lockup when using File Manager/Verify to check detached signatures is
fixed for me by 0.11.8.1.
