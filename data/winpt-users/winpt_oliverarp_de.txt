Hi List,
Im trying to sign and encrypt some plain text files.
Windows XP SP2
WinPT 1.2
GnuPG 1.4.6
Im using the hotkeys, Alt+Shift+I for sign and encrypt.
I open the txt file, press Alt+Shift+I and WinPT pops up,
I check the account I have created only for crypting files (4096 bit),
WinPT asks for my password an a few second later it tells me its ready.
BUT is ist NOT, the text is still there.
I have already signed and encrypted some txt files this way.
Why is it not working anymore?
Please help.

Yes, not in notepad.
Yes, I checked the clipboard, the encrypted text is in there.
How can it be pasted into the open window? Notepad in this case.
I checked that I used to encrypt "current window" and not clipboard.
