@_subject: [Winpt-users] Source code? 
Hash: RIPEMD160
I see new versions of WinPT (0.10.x) are releasing but source code is
available only for 0.9.92 and older. Also since 0.10.2 WinPT comes with
GnuPG new version executable. Of course, I don't wish to use
cryptographic product until source will be published.
Will source code be published (and when)? Or I'm wrong and it's already
available openly?
