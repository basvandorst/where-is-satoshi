Tried it, nothing happens when I follow this procedure.
No signature, no crash, no nothing
I don't crash.
I DO crash when I try to sign a file.
After typing my very secret password, winpt crashes, no Dr.Watson, but I
have to kill it in the taskmanager.
Mine is W2K nl

I think I did something wrong here.
I tried it on a other computer (same OS) and everything worked fine.
Again this did not happen on a different computer, sames OS
The only difference I can think of is that I have 2 private keys on the
first computer, instead of 1.
I'll investigate and try again tomorrow on the first machine.
Maybe I'm a version behind or something.
sorry about the confusion.

Well, It seemed that all my versions are the same.
I also applied a little patience and it seems that signing detached takes
about 60 seconds (58k file).
During that time the File Manager 'seems' to have crashed.
The window stays on top and there is no cursor to move the window (I'm
typing this blind).
Yesterday I killed it with task manager.
If you just wait it will finish ok.
hope this helps.
and Timo, thanks for the efforts

The 'slow' one is a Pentium 4, 2.4 GHz,1 GB memory
The fast one is a Athlon 64, 3000+,1 GB memory
Not very different.
When I sign a file with GPGee  it is very
fast on both machines.
On the Athlon it takes about 5 seconds to sign a 22 MB file, detached,
no ascii output
GPGee takes about 2 seconds
Both use the same gpg.exe 1.4.3-cvs
Both are W2K sp4 + hotfixes, dutch.
Maybe, but why doesn's GPGee have the same problems?
He uses your MyGPGME library :-)

No, works fine here.
mmm, winpt doesn't appear to be pasting by itself.
Signed ok, but pasted manually.
will test further

Got it, tested it.
Thank you very much.
Only a minor, minor, minimal issue.
I tried to validate the zip with your expired key with the File Manager.
It got an error 'Error during verification process', not a very helpful
Only after verifying on the command line, I saw the message that the key
 had expired.
maybe something for 1.0.1?
After updating the key (key server update works fine!)
it all worked, yay :-)
using gpg 1.4.5 and winpt-1.0.0pre3

Well, you signed it with your laptop key.
The one I had, had expired.
I's updated now.
I would like to suggest to offer the WinPT_Intro.pdf as a separate
download on wald.intevation.org.
Nice documentation, but 1 is enough :-)
Speaking of the pdf, is gpg 1.4.5 not the required version?
People might get into trouble trying to run (the unpatched) gpg 1.4.4
with winpt 1.0.0.
Just thought I'd mention it.
You're very welcome.
Looking forward to the release party!

yes, please
I'm always having troubles to find the beta's.
I'm even having troubles getting the stables too, the gnupg.org ftp
server is, ehm quirky. I seem to get stuck in a loop, except when I use
a non-windows commandline ftp client.
