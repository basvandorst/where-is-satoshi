Actually there is not, it's working finally for my
systems. So thanks a lot for the fix and your
great work on WinPT!

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Proxy preferences not saved correctly - fix 
Hi, I just experienced, that WinPT 1.0.1 does not really save the proxy type you
configure in its proxy preferences for the keyservers, meaning after a
restart of WinPT you end up with the proxy type "NONE", regardless if you
configured "HTTP" the session before.
This setting changes HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\WinPT\Keyserver\Proto but
regardless of any manual overwrite of this setting in the Windows registry, WinPT does not recognize it. But if you change the setting via WinPT again,
the value of this key is set back to "1" (the standard setting).
No I looked over the sources and think I found the problem:
in the file "wptKeyserver.h" you can find the following lines:
enum proxy_proto_t {
    PROXY_PROTO_NONE = 0,
    PROXY_PROTO_HTTP,
    PROXY_PROTO_SOCKS4,
    PROXY_PROTO_SOCKS5
Now there seems to be no real constant value for PROXY_PROTO_HTTP, maybe this is the right entry point to solve the problem mentioned above!?
I did not look close enough to the sources but I hope this helps to fix my
problem and maybe release a WinPT 1.0.1a or something because I can't
explain my users to set this setting every time they start WinPT :-)
Thanks a lot for any reaction to this and you time.
Regards, David Elze

Even if I change the value for the proxy type in the registry to
0 or 2, WinPT does not recognize it but resets the value to 1
without  complaints.
Yep sorry, I was young and needed the money or
something ;-)
I don't think so, because I can manually edit the value and
it's stored. And WinPT does actually overwrites and saves
the value if I changed it to something different than 1.
Well, actually this installation is in a multi-user environment
and WinPT (as a part of Gpg4Win) was installed by the admin-
user. But as I said, I'm able to change the values of the registry
as user so that can't be the problem I think!?
Thanks a lot for your time!

In the meantime I think, the problem is not NONE vs. HTTP
but the proxy setting in general. WinPT can't access the
keyserver after a restart because it doesn't seem to use
the proxy settings  at all. First, I've to open the keyserver
settings and the proxy settings where I've to click "OK" ...
 otherwise the proxy is not used.
So maybe this helps to find the problem!?
