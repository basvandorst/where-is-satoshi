maybe you want to install gpg, gpgol and winpt and test it with Outlook
to send enrypted mails. Then you get a pretty good impression how much
work lies before you. Just if you look at winpt, there's a lot of stuff
that was implemented.
 thanks for your good work, I really like winPT. Keep up the good
work ! Maybe one suggestion for the key-manager. You have icons for
private and public keys there. I remeber when I used PGP 6.5, there was
also a different icon for the deafult private key.
