Dear Sir,
for TIMO --i do not intend using the available products at all as my self
esteem doesn't allow me to do so, what i want is some guidance to help me
learn what it takes to develop a frontend like winpt and a plugin like gpgol
.What all tools , libraries, exe , software should i install prior to
starting . I mean can u tell me the ingredients to start on my work of
developing a frontend and a plugin for gpg
can u OR ANY ONE help me. to tell you I have VS 2005 and need to work in
vc++ .pl tell if the platform chosen is ok.
should have I chosen c# to build a plugin for outlook.
for the designing issue should plugin have a separate frontend or the
frontendwhich i desire to develop shall be called by the plugin which i will
be developing. I need your guidance on this
regards vineet

To make sure I understand you, you can _NOT_ use the existing programs
which are available (for example WinPT and GPGol), right?
If you need to start from scratch, you should make sure that you are
able to import functions from a Windows DLL, because GPGME is the
de-facto standard interface lib to GPG. If you also plan to write a
new GPG interface lib, you can use any language.
Most of the available GPG "related" code is written in C/C++ and
then Java/C

thanks timo sir for the pain you take to handle queries like mine.
 i have to built this as a project for my organisation( ofcourse not using
winpt or gpgol). I am absolutely a new entry in professional world of
programming and this going to be my first big software package . I am
clueless about how to proceede. no idea about licensing and etc...
i know only the name of the dish i have to serve but i am at this stage
clueless about what all ingredients are to be used to prepare it. shall i
learn windows programming, shall i learn vc++, once learnt do i have to
built a frontend and call functions from the existing gpg source code or
learn how to call a gpg commands from vc++. I had asked my guide ( senior)
but i am not getting clarity on the issue . i need some elaborate questions
to find answers on building frontend and a plugin for gpg. You can say a
little scope elaboration of this project is required .
Please if time permits your busy schedule and you feel you can guide a
newbie like me . i shall be thankfull. what i could understand and know till
now i am enclosing it below. tell me if i am going in the right direction .
i shall be highly obliged

@_subject: [Winpt-users] What is the format of the passphrase stored. 
Dear timo thanks for just replying with the bulls eye answer regarding
calculation of hash .. thx once again to all who replied.
If i know correctly as discussed on the mail lisr some time back the
passphrase becomes part of the private key
Can u pl tell that in what format is the passphrase stored in the keyring
2. what is the format of passphrase while it is stored on the keyserver (iam
using pks0.9.6 ... will it be different for different server).
3. if passphrase ( bits making the passphrase ) is not part of the private
key where is it stored and in what format.?
regards and thx a lot

Dear all,
how do we calculate and thus see the hash of any file in GPG. is there a
provision of doing it through winpt or there is some command in GPG. or to
do that i need to install a md5 or sha1sum.exe and then run the command from
command prompt to get the values..

Dear Timo
i read your reply which said
*I'm a little confused.
*>* For encryption, let's assume you mean public-key encryption, no
*>* passphrase is needed. For symmetric encryption, it is stored in
*>* (secure[if available]) memory.
My query is that which memory . that is can i have acces to that memory. can
someone acces that memory to recover my passphrase.
or can i access that memory in my computer to recover my passphrase if
forgotten. can u pl tell which specific memory are u talking about and how
can that be accessed if at all it can be....

Daer John
timo replied me that it is stored in some memory..so i asked this after all
it has to be part of somthing so that it is used whether internally or
how else does the verification says bad passphrase where does it check or
what does it check to come to conlusion of accepting the passphrase or
rejecting the passphrase  in symmetric encryption, decryption, or signing or
editing a key
Can u please put some highlight on this

On searching on this error i have read few articles telling that its a error

i am building a frontend and not able to handle generation of keys and all
those commands which need user intervention. is there any other solution .
can u pl tell something on this
