@_subject: [Winpt-users] Encrypting Files via File Manager 
I feel silly asking this question, but when I'm trying to encrypt files using the File Manager, after choosing my key, WinPT returns the error "Invalid Value".
I am using XP Pro SP2.
Thank you

I created a new key, and that didnt' cause any problems. So I'm thinking the issue was with the old key. Thanks for your help!

The "Wipe Free Space" option does give you a dialog box asking to choose which drive to perform the operation. However, once the operation starts, the status indicator will still says "None" (or something like that) until it's done, then it says "Complete". It would be nice if the program would offer different "wipe" options.

Does anyone know if a binary for Win32 is going to be made available for version 2.0?
