@_subject: [Winpt-users] Install/Uninstall 
What are the steps for install/uninstall of WinPT?
I've already done the install of GnuPG 1.4.5.
I've downloaded the exe.zip, done the unzip and now have a folder with the
exe, dll etc. Do these need to be copied someplace special or do I just
execute the exe for this folder and it "self-installs"? The pdf file just
say run the exe.
How do I uninstall WinPT?
