Hi all, Using WinPT v1.2 on Windows XP Pro.  I've exported a couple of public/secret keys in ASCII format which I
then imported  into GnuPG 1.4.7 using the command line.  I can see the keys (oecd & Eurospan) using...  U:\>gpg --list-secret-keys
C:/Documents and Settings/grayd/Application Data/gnupg\secring.gpg
sec   1024R/D4DCCF89 2005-01-06
uid                  grayd at extenza-turpin.com
sec   1024R/901D7CDD 2004-06-18
uid                  oecd
sec   1024R/7A88AFCD 1999-10-08
uid                  eurospan
However I cannot see these from the WinPT interface (Or the GNU Privacy
Assistant).  Using the latter program I can see the keys in the preferences window.  Can anyone tell me how to make this key pair available to WinPT so I can
encrypt and decrypt data wit hit? This is the output from PGP where the keys cam from originally. L:\>pgp -kv secring.pgp

Hi Timo, My comments are down in the main body of the text. Could I have your email address and I will send the screenshots?  Thanks David -----Original Message-----

The problem could be, that you might have different keyrings
and you imported it into the one but WinPT uses the other?
