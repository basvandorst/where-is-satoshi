@_subject: [Winpt-users] Announcement for WinPT 0.11.2 
A few hours ago I released WinPT version 0.11.2.
The release is splitted into the binary and the source archive.
It is mainly a bug fix release, which solves some problems reported by users and it contains an almost complete native language system.
Solved issues:
- File Manager: in one case the 'File Save' dialog was hidden behind
  the FM window. This is now solved (Thanks to Ralf).
- Keyserver: When a key was successfully received and not in the keyring
  the reload cache flag is set. (Thanks to Jan-Oliver/Bernhard).
- The output of 'gpg --sign' is now recognized as 'SIGNED' and not as
  'ENCRYPTED'.
And a lot of other minor issues.
Unsolved issues:
- The mysterious key cache window which remains on some systems.
=== Native Language Support ===
The German translation file for WinPT 0.11.2 can be downloaded at:
In the next weeks I will start to contact translators and/or find new
maintainers for the other languages. If you know somebody who is willing
to maintain a language, please contact me. The existing translation files
are obsolete due to the heavy changes in the WinPT code over the last month.

That's weird because this code uses a timer and after it expired,
the dialog should be automatically destroyed.
I'm a little confused due to all the different situations, does the
'gpg status message box' is hanging on the screen all the time?
Again I did some tests but in the entire time I can remember, the
'gpg status message box' never remained on screen.

What does "blank" in this case mans?
On slower machines it might take some time to verify a detached signature
for a large file. What size does the file has that was signed?
I tested the code with the last released and I did not check any
code, but that does not change the fact that somethig is wrong.
Of course I will test it myself ASAP. Can anybody confirm the problem?

Another issue I currently work on is locale support. Not only for
the language, but also for other issues which are influenced by
such settings. The date format for example.
There is no problem with the ISO date format, but due to the fact
that almost every Windows software uses country specific formats,
I thought it would be a good idea to do the same in WinPT. This helps
new users and IMHO it also looks more familiar for advanced users also.
Any user feedback on this issue is welcome!

I'm again not sure if I understand. You mean the signature won't
be verified and the Dialogs is shown?
Weird. Is it possible you try with a 'test secret key again? If it also
crashes with this key, please send it to me so I'm hopefully able to
reproduce it. I tried with 2 test keys and I never had any problems.
(Did you create a detached/cleartext/normal signature? How big is
 the source file, etc...)
Hint: The new code is slower for bigger files so if just the hour glass
      is shown, there is activity. Of course if WinPT crashes, something
      is wrong.

OK, I checked it again with a new generated key and I could not
find any problems. I checked all 3 modes in combination with the
'armor' flag.
Same here. I tried with an existing RSA key and it worked and then I
used a new DSA key and I got no crash either.
I guess this must have something to do with your environment then.
Please can you summarize your gpg pathes and options (+ winpt options)?

Even so it worked there, you did nothing wrong. WinPT should work in
any environment. Now the problem is to find out what the difference is
and to provide a fix.
I tried both combinations. It either must have something to do with
the secret keys itself or with some options.
No problem. Maybe it's a bug which just shows up under some circumstances
so I would not call this confusion...

How fast is your machine? I tried with ~1.2 Ghz and there I can sign
about 20-40 MB in 60 seconds.
Thanks for the patience, but this time is way too long for such
a short file. I had the same problems with W9X machines and there
it is definitely the I/O backend code from the operating system.
With NT5 based systems I thought this is not an issue any longer.

On any machine >= 1000 Mhz it should be an issue

GPGee still uses my old MyGPGME lib which uses a different
approach to pass data to GPG.
Anyway, even with GPGME fast data exchange is possible. I will

Yes, but WinPT uses the orignal GPGME package and thus

registry entries and pathes (and this causes the crash)...

my machine.
I will prepare a new release for tomorrow. Until you can disable the
wrap-feature to avoid the crash.

Recently GPG changed its standard behaviour when generating keys.
The result is that the primary key is not able to sign data any more.
This is fixed in the CVS now and my release tomorrow, will also update
the gpg.exe to fix this problem.
If you recently generated a key pair, please check that the primary
key is able to sign (you can see it in the Key Edit dialog. When the
'S' column has no '*', the key is for certification only). In this
case, if you also want to generate signatures over data, it is the
best solution to add a signing subkey to the key pair which fixes
the problem.

GPG should be compatible with PGP8 and thus WinPT should have
no problems to decrypt/verify data. When I find somebody with PGP8,
I will provide some tests.
What does this exactly means? Because the key was missing? Because
the signature (text) was broken?
This is interesting. Maybe you can try with the new beta version.
Just make sure that you disabled the word-wrap feature.
I never heard of such a problem. Usually all bugs are no problem
when you quit the program and start it again.
I would suggest to updat to the latest beta at Wald and try again.

Maybe I don't understand but the caching system must first read your
passphrase before it can be cached. And this only happens during
decryption or signing.

I wanted to thank you for reporting the wipe problem and the verification
problem. I fixed both in the CVS and I will release a new version after I

The verification problem occurs because (good!) signatures created
by non-valid keys will be treated as invalid signatures. This is of course
wrong and I fixed it. If you sign my key non-exportable, you wil see that
the signature is good.

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Mysterious window problem 
I'm a little concerned about the problem that the cache window
sometimes remain on the screen. It must have something to do
with the local environment.
Maybe even with registry privileges. WinPT uses a key counter which
is stored in the registry. If this value cannot be updated, it might
be possible that the dialog remains on screen.
Anybody with these 'mysterious window' problem, please can you check
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\WinPT\nKey? If the value is 10 times bigger
than the actual key count (or a 'random' number like 4986723), it would
be nice to send a mail to the list.
Or maybe the problem is related to the account privileges. I guess many work with admin rights. Maybe the problem occurs if you work with user rights.

I'm pleased to announce the first beta of WinPT which uses the original
GPGME package. The version is 0.10.2-beta. I will add the "-beta" part as
long as the code needs to be tested. Propably for 2-3 more releases.
But in general the new version should work exactly like the old version.
I tried to test much of the core functions and in the last time, less and
less bugs & problems occurred. I don't say it's ready for daily use, but
pretty close to it.
First a quick note about the installation procedure:
a) Unzip the archive into a single directory.
b) Backup your old gpg.exe version and replace it with the gpg.exe
   from the archive. This beta (and all newer versions) need at least
   GPG 1.4.3-cvs or newer.
c) The DLLs do _not_ need to be copied to the SYSTEM32 folder. It is
   perfectly okay to have them in the same directory where WinPT.exe
   exists.
d) Finished.
Neither the configuration nor the registry values changed.
You can download the release at the WinPT project page at       (under "Files")
You can also get the source code there ("SCM").
sha1sum of the file:
Please report all problems to the list and in case of real bugs,
please use the tracker to fill out a bug report.
Here is an overview what's new:
* Show GPG information box centered relative to the dialog which called it.
* Support %APPDATA% in the GPG registry to have better support for multi
  user environments.
* Improved native language support.
* A lot of minor bug fixes all over the place.
I encourage all users to switch to this version so it reaches the
same level of stability as the old version. I did not change any
critical code, so the problems which can occur should not destroy
any data (maybe the clipboard contents but not keyrings, etc...).
I will provide the files on  also, but for now
the primary site for the beta phase is the new project page.

I accidental introduced a bug I fixed before and now signing does not work.
Tomorrow I will release a new snapshot which fixes this and a problem
that all newly generated keys are not able to sign data. You need a

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Use of OpenPGP card 
Yes. Actually I tested it with a brand new 1.1 OpenPGP card.
For me card generation worked.
I also succeded to generate signatures and to decrypt data.
There are no special preparaton needed. If you import a card key,
the Key Manager should mark it as "pub/crd" otherwise something is wrong.
Extra caution must be used with the PIN because after 3 wrong admin PINs
the card is locked forever. But GPG has a mechanism that it fails
after the wrong PIN was entered and thus a card lock is hardly
possible. I don't say the WinPT interface does not work, but propably
some extra (developer) tests would be useful.

@_author: Timo Schulz 
@_subject: [Winpt-users] Use of OpenPGP card 
The information stored on the card contain only the raw crypto data
needed to do the decryption and signing. The actual OpenPGP (GPG) data
is located in the pubring.gpg and secring.gpg (just a stub which indicates
to use a card). You can save a key url, on the card and with the
'fetch' command in gpg --card-edit you can import the GPG key from this URL.
IMHO you always need the GPG part of the key also, but I will check this.
Did you lost the GPG key data or maybe I don't exactly understand the problem.

@_author: Timo Schulz 
@_subject: [Winpt-users] Use of OpenPGP card 
Exactly. But the advantage is that the key part in the secring.gpg is
just a stub and you don't need to care about security of the secret key
because it's only stored on the smart card. So if you keep your card
always safe, you can copy it too much computers as you want.

then the code would not work on 98 or very slow.

- open the Key Manager and the keys are read from c:\gnupg\pubring.gpg.
- open the GPG prefs. the settings were stored -> OK
       (checked the registry: likewise).
- open the GPG prefs again. change settings to $APPDATA\gnupg -> OK.

- the Key Manager reloads the key and shows the keys from

If you decrypt a mail and you want to use this text in the reply,

@_subject: [Winpt-users] GPGoe 0.8.1 is now available 
Because it might be possible that GPGoe's extended features
are in conflict with other programs, the new default behaviour
is to disable them all.
Via the popup menu in the taskbar program, you can enable them
manually if it works for you. Currently the only feature is
the "Allow plain text replies".
And for your information, it worked on the machines I tested it
without any problems. On the other hand, not too much extra software
was installed there . My hope is that the feature will work on most machines and other can disable it, which means at least the core functions are still useable.
And last but not least, I added a feature to check for known programs
which are in conflict with GPGoe. If the init program founds them,
a warning is issued and the user can decided if he wants to continue or
Any user which has problems with 0.8.0 should update to 0.8.1
as soon as possible.

Import the public key first and then the secret key. I never had any
problems with it. But please make sure you use the patched gpg 1.4.4
version or gpg 1.4.3.
This sounds like the "old" GPG 1.4.4 problem with the import. gpg4win

@_subject: [Winpt-users] WinPT global hook(?) 
Hash: SHA1
I really think it is important to ask if you are unsure what's going on.
The reason is, that trojan or other evil programs might be able to write
itself into the process space of a trusted process. In the past this was
a problem and some personal firewalls were not able to handle it.
So let me explain some of the details. The PTD.dll uses a hook to
remember the current window, but this hook cannot be used for any
key logging. It is called a CTB - Computer Based Training hook and
only called when another window gets the focus or a window is created.
For details, please see the PTD.cpp (or the MSDN for details about the
CTB hook).
In newer WinPT versions, a modified edit control is used to make the
passphrase handling more secure. This code uses a hook to break the
chain of global defined hooks. Actually there is no real code, just
a return value which indicate that other (possible previously defined)
hooks shall _not_ be executed. But this hook is only active when the
passphrase dialog is active. After the passphrase is successfully sent
to GPG, the dummy hook will be released.
In short, the only active hook, I mean all the time, is the CTB hook
to store the current window.
If you need more details, please feel free to ask. I don't want to hide
anything and of course you can also study the code (or let someone else
do it) if you want to see the implemtation.

* Bug fix in file name handling for the MAPI feature.
* The key sign dialog now lists all user IDs and not only
  the primary to indicate that all user IDs will be signed.
* The signature property dialog now contain all useful
  information about the sig, which includes the creation date.
* A bug in the key deleting code has been fixed. The problem
  is only related to the GUI synchronisation and not the delete
  process itself.
* Support to retrieve the PKA record directly from the DNS.
  This allows to perform a validity check of the key if a
  PKA record is available for the key.
* The Current Window Support does know correctly reset the
  cursor position within the foreground window.
* Fix problem in the key cache which might lead to a segv
  after importing a secret key or if the last secret key
  will be deleted.

==end changelog==
The final 1.0 version (binary archive) also contains a new
PDF documentation and it gives a general introduction about
WinPT and its functions. Even for experienced users, this
text might give some hints to to optimize the use of the
software and some tips how to perform operations easier.

Please use the bug tracker of the project to report problems

you should use the forums at wald, so other user can profit from
the answer of others users and to make sure that a question wasn't

Happy encrypting,

I assumed it would be an utf8 issue.
In general it's a good idea always to use the latest release of WinPT.
So the problem is solved now, right?
As the warning points out, 8-bit chars in the passphrase can be
a problem. In general I would suggest to avoid them and to use
a longer passphrase instead.

OK. What kind of license to you plan to use?
You said you don't want to use existing available product so I'm not
sure if I can help you. You only need the gpg.exe and an interface
description (for example for Exchange extensions).
VS can be used to build a plugin/frontend. It contains all you ned.
I'm not sure if there is an C# interface. I would suggest
to use C/C++.
It seems you have a lot of questions but I don't have much information.
Without details about the expected result (the "application") I can't
say much about the design process.
Plus I'm not sure what you really want to know. I can't give an
ad-hoc cookbook how to build a gpg front-end or a gpg exchange
Don't get me wrong, I always try to answer general questions but
IMHO what you ask for is very time consuming and right now I'm
a little busy with working on WinPT and gpgol.

@_subject: [Winpt-users] What is the format of the passphrase stored. 
The passphrase is *not* stored in the keyring!
The passphrase will be hashed in combined with a salt to
produce a "derrived random key" which is used to encrypt
the secret key parts.
It seems you have a wrong picture of (public key) cryptography. I would
suggest to read some basic documents about the concepts if you are
interested in technical details.
Of course the keyserver just stores the *public* parts of the key.
The secret key _should_ never leave your machine/smartcard/disk.
RFC2440 describes the procedure to convert a "string=passphrase" to a
key (S2K).
Sorry that I can give you a more detailed answer,

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Announcement for WinPT 1.2.0 
I'm pleased to announce a new WinPT version (1.2.0).
It mainly introduces some interface changes and a lot
of minor bug fixes.
For now it's only available at wald.intevation.org
but of course I will update the official website later.
I got a lot of mails in the past from users who were
confused about some (advanced) features WinPT offers
and its way to configure them. And I've to admit that
the purpose of WinPT is a graphical front-end for GPG
and _not_ a universal crypto program.
That's why I use the next release to separate or remove
interface which need a lot of cryptographic knowledge.
* For example the different wipe modes(*)
* Related to the wipe mode is free space wiping,
  it is disabled in 1.2.0. (*)
* Some might remember my first steps with CryptDisk.
  The code is still alive but it will be separated
  from WinPT. And due to missing free time, it is frozen
  for undefinte time.
As noted before, secure wiping is a very difficult
task especially on journaling file systems like NTFS.
Dedicated tools should be used for this purpose (or
alternatively, I might provide such a feature in an
extra program).

I currently try provide new translation files, but this needs time. And
with time I mean, the translation itself and to find a maintainer.
Installers are a complex task and the gpg4win installer tries to build
"automatically" so a new version can be provided very fast when updates
of the included programs are available.
Actually I planned for a long time to "clean up" this plugin but
currently I don't have any time for this task.
I will try to talk with the other involved persons and "relay" your
feedback to them.
I work on a mobile feature in WinPT which allows to run WinPT from
a mobile device. And there is no use of the registry or temp files
except on the mobile device.
Due to lack of time, I can't include it in the next release but I
already implemented parts of the system.
In general it would be useful if you could add such "feature requests"
to the wald.intevation.org (project:winpt) tracker so I have a better
overview about such things.
Thank you for the feedback, it's welcome and useful.

GnuPT exists for a long time and now GPG4win also provides a convenient
way to use an installer to skip the manual steps.
Indeed it is under development. But the recent versions seem to work
with Outlook 2003 (SP2).
It is just the installing system for GPG Windows "Programs". Programs
in this case mean, programs that use GPG (frontends, explorer extension
plugins, ...).
Currently GPG4win includes these packages:
Sylpheed - GPG (PGP/MIME aware) mailer
GPGol   - Outlook plugin
GPG     - Core program
GPA	- Key manager
WinPT	- GPG front-end
GPGee	- Explorer extension
For such questions, please use the gpg4win mailing lists.
A good idea but it would involve a lot of work and a central project
management. In the past the Windows Privacy Tools tried to solve
some problems but due to missing time of the members the project
was frozen.
For general gpg4win questions (recommendations, feedback, ...) please
use the forum and the mailing lists hosted at wald.intevation.org.
I hope I could at least (partly) answer some questions.

I just wanted to say that we found the problem why WinPT is very
slow while it processes larger files (on Pentium systems with
enabled HT).
This problem should be fixed in the latest GPGME version and I
plan to release (hopefully!) WinPT 0.11.8 at the end of the
week with the new DLL to solve the problem.
I would be happy about any feedback from users with P4 (HT enabled)
machines after the release is out.
Anybody who doesn't want to wait, it's also possible to create the
gpgme.dll from the latest CVS version and compile it with mingw32.
It should be sufficient to overwrite the old dll with the new version.

After the bug report about WinPT+W98 I checked the latest binary
on this system myself but I did not find any problems.
The first time I tried, I used a corrupted DLL which resulted in
a crash. Maybe one of the DLLs were corrupted or maybe older
DLLs are present in a system directory. This is currently my only clue.
IIRC, the user who reported this problem uses an AMD64(Sempron, ...)
CPU and maybe there is a problem with new integer sizes. I don't
think so but, sooner or later I definitely need to check compatbility
of the code with the Win64 (64-bit systems).

Hash: SHA1
Because I would like to have some feedback about the new icons and
the general Key Manager design, I uploaded an unofficial WinPT CVS version.
Unofficial just means there will be no download entry at Gforge and
I won't make it public via an news item there.
The official 0.11.5 will follow the next days after I got some feedback
and this version will be released at Gforge as the versions before.
The zip archive just contains the new WinPT.exe and the libgpgme-11.dll
file. Just overwrite the existing files, the PTD.dll from 0.11.4 is
compatible with 0.11.5-cvs. That's it.
WinPT now uses $APPDATA\winpt for storing config files so you will
propably get a message that the keyserver.conf will be moved to this
With the new 0.11.5-cvs version it's possible to edit the config
file directly with the keyserver dialog instead of doing it manually.
Just open the dialog and select a keyserver entry. Right click brings
up a popup-menu with "Add", "Remove" and "Edit". For additional safety
reasons, please backup your existing keyserver.conf before.
The files can be downloaded from here:
For the German folks, I also updated the German language file. I hope
to provide other languages in the near future.

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Announcement for WinPT 0.11.5 
A few minutes ago I released WinPT version 0.11.5.
It contains bug fixes for reported problems and general improvements for the GUI (Key Manager).
It now provides icons to show the difference between
public keys and key pairs and there is also a new toolbar with more icons for the most common operations.
As I said before, the keyserver configuration can be
now done with WinPT and there is no need to do it manually.
All user specific WinPT configuration is now saved under
$APPDATA\winpt. This is the reason you will get a message box at the first start which says that the keyserver.conf
is copied there. The keyserver.conf is updated when WinPT
is shut down.

Ah, OK. This button will be automatically enabled when a file
with the name "winpt.chm" was found in the WinPT folder. Because
I still found no time to finish the work, it's grayed out.
It just says "Last German translation file".
WinPT uses a simplified version of gettext and thus you need to
rename your preferred language (de.mo for example) to program-name.mo.
For WinPT "de.mo" -> "winpt.mo". Then it should work.

Yes and no. I tested it with default settings and also with
a user defined folders.
Only for the case an installer was used because in this case it
might lead too more trouble to change the folders.
I will definitely test it again.
I implemented the "override default setting" checkbox. It either does
not seem to work or people except that it does something else. If you
check this box, all GPG preference items (homedir, locale-dir, gpg-exe)
should be editable again.

It seemed that I missed to apply a patch and thus some code is missing in 0.11.5. It is nothing critical, just the checkbox code
to enable the GPG preference dialog items. Which can be a problem
for people who recently changed the folders and now WinPT also need
to be adjusted.
Due to this and the fact that I got a bug report short after the
release, I decide to make a new release after I tested the changes.
There is no need to worry, except these issue 0.11.5 should work.

Due to a missing patch the expert key generation did not work
in 0.12.2. I released 0.12.3 which fixes this problem. Please update to 0.12.3 as soon as you can.

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Announcement for the first pre release of 1.0 
after a very long time I finally decided to step forward to 1.0.
In the next weeks I will continue to release 1 or two more pre
releases of the 1.0 branch for testing and for suggestions.
A few minutes ago I uploaded the first pre-release for the public.
Here is a short summarize of bug fixes/features:
* The passphrase dialog now contains an additional
  hint for which key the passphrase is.
* Do sanity checks to avoid that the user can mark
  a revoked user id as the primary ID. And similar
  that a fully trusted user ID cannot be signed again.
* The Key Manager now remembers the window size and
  restore the values from the registry and resize the
  window accordingly.
* The key sign dialog now has a feature to display the
  photo of the key owner if it is available.
* Fix a problem in the key edit dialog when a new
  subkey was added and the algorithm was displayed
  as "???".
Any feedback is welcome. I will release the final 1.0
when I finished the PDF documentation, when the maintained
translations are ready and when I removed all import things
from my TODO list. My plan is to do the release end of June.
I encourage anybody to test the pre-release. It should useable for
daily work in most situations. As a careful author, I added a hint
on the website that says "a very good beta quality". I will remove
this text when I release the second pre version.

I forgot something...
If there are volunteers for working on the translations, that
would be great. German and Japanese are actively maintained,
but the others are still without a maintainer. For example the
French translation is 50% done.
Any help would be appricated, there is no need to become an
active maintainer.

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Announcement for the second pre-release of 1.0.0 
a few minutes ago I released a new pre-version. It mainly
contains bug fixes but it also introduces a new 'feature'.
=== NEWS ===
* The key sign dialog now has a feature to display the
  photo of the key owner if it is available.
* Fix a problem in the key edit dialog when a new
  subkey was added and the algorithm was displayed
  as "???".
* The verify list dialog now also uses icons to
  make it easier to recognize the signature state visually.
* Allow 8-bit passphrases, formerly utf8 encoding of the
  passphrases.
* Avoid crashes when the user tries to execute functions
  that access the key cache during synchronisation.
* Better keyserver error messages.
* The decrypt/verify command does not show a separate signature
  verify message box for each message any longer but add
  the signature information to the viewer dialog. This avoids
  that the user needs to remind the signature state, while viewing
  the text.
* Fix a special case in the keyserver code which would lead to
  a crash after receiving.
=== END ===
You can download the files either from or directly from The final 1.0.0 release still need some more time, but I'm
optimistic to release it in July.

I can understand that you are tired of trying new versions, but I really
tried hard to reproduce the problem without success. I also asked other
users to find a common "source" in the environment, but this did not
work either. I'm not sure what to do, because I can't reproduce it.

Actually the dialog uses fixed column widths and does not do any
guessing. I agree that it would be useful to save the list view.
This should be no problem.
Actually most of the column names should be indicate its use. If
this is not the case, we should propably better think of different
names. The C/S/E/A columns are special, and there it might be useful
to have a tool tip. I could also increase the column width to:
Certify/Sign/Encrypt/Authenticate, but because the information is
just yes/no ("*" or "") the dialog would get very large without
any advantage.
I work on a sentensive help, but this issue consumes a lot of work. This is definitely an important issue. I will think about it, how to
make it clearer.
I don't think this is the right place to integrate the photo-ids. But I
could offer a "showphoto" in the command list to display it. This way
the photo could be displayed on demand.
Well, this could be useful. I will also add this point to the TODO list.
IMHO, it makes sense to separate the items. The WinPT preferences are
global and not only related to the Key Manager. But the GPG prefs are
directly related to the Key Manager because if you change the home dir,
the Key Manager automatically reloads the Key Manager.
It would be easy to change this, but IMHO it is no big deal to use the
tray to open the preferences of the requested item and the gpg config
file is rarely changing and thus it should be also no problem.

This is weird and I guess this will never change ;-).
Actually I did not change the current window code for a while, but
I often get mails from users who say "it worked with the last release
but not any longer". But because I did not change anything, there must
be a random factor I need to figure out.
Again, the current window mode makes assumptions about the current
window and not all kind of windows are supported. If I can find some
time, I try to improve the code.
Now we are talking about the CWS mode, do you use the hotkeys for
the current window mode or directly the task bar menu?

That's a good point. But actually a lot of people already have problems
due to all the registered hotkeys and I don't want to produce more error
messages. I know it would be an option to disable the entire hotkeys,
but 6 hotkeys are already very much.
You could solve this problem with external programs (IMHO), very easy.
The clipboard editor will be started after decryption if the user wishes
it and IMHO this should be sufficient. To have hotkeys for all kind
of command will be very messy and increases the chance that reserved
hotkeys will be used and this produces error messages.
Wheen the field is empty no hotkey should be enabled for the selected action.
Maybe cross links would make sense, but actually I can't think of many.
I see that it can be a problem when there are many taskbar icon
(programs) but IMHO it is not too hard to select the  and popup
the menu to select an entry.
Actually I thought about to "modernize" this dialog. With a menu or
at least a popup menu to allow such features.
Good point. I will add this ASAP.
Actually I need to do the "remember the position" features for all
kind of primary windows.

Recently I got a bug report that WinPT crashes when a key will be deleted. I can't reproduce this behaviour and I tried with several keys. My question is, can anybody confirm that this will happen each time you try to delete a key?
I guess, again this is a combination of some pre-conditions and now
my duty is to find them out.

But before I do a real release, I would like to make sure it works
on the very common systems (XP, 2K with a new OE version). If anybody
is willing to test the BETA release, I would prepare a zip and upload
it to the winpt website.
The encryption/verify part should flawlessly work, but my concern is

won't work any longer on newer systems.
Any feedback is welcome. Also general feedback if I should continue

I'm sorry to say this, but I've no X64 system and thus I can only guess.
To make sure we talk about the same issues, with X64 you mean the Intel Xeon 64 CPU?
For a long time I've an item on my TODO list which says, that the code
needs to be tested in a 64-bit environment with the Win64 API.
To track down the problem...you say you can't use GPG at all. What does
it mean, I mean if encryption via WinPT works GPG must also work. At least in this case. When you could provide detailled error messages
or other "relevant" information, this would be very useful.
Just a quick note...Windows 2003 is definitely a server OS and very
new. Of course Win32 program should also run in this environment, but
maybe there are limitations. I also don't have access to W2003 so I
can't do any tests.

I'm not sure what you're saying here. GPGol is able to search for WinPT
and GPA. If one of them is found, it is used. What's the problem?
About what specific issue we are talking?
I'm a little confused now. You want to sign the mail so the recipient
can verify it? Or what do you mean by "verify that e-mail was actually
signed by 'X'"?
There are two icons in the toolbar (and also two menu entries). So if
you want to sign the mail, just click on the toolbar icon or select
the GPG/Sign entry directly via the menu. I still can't figure out if the GPGol plugin was successfully installed
or not. Please give a little more information. GPGol needs at least
Outlook 2003 (SP2).
GPGol can help you a lot when you want to secure the Outlook communication. We just need to track down the source of the problem
and it should work.

Hash: SHA1
A recently recovered, that there might be a problem when you
sign a _key_ and you set an expiration date for the signature.
In most case, NO expiration date for the signature will be set!
I will prepare a new release as soon as possible which fixes problem.
As a workaround, please manually add "ask-cert-expire" in your
gpg.conf when you issue signatures that need to have an expiration date.
The next release will offer to add this option to your gpg.conf.
If you issued a signature that need to have an expiration date, the
solution is to revoke the old signature (without the expiration date!),
make sure that you have "ask-cert-expire" in your gpg.conf and repeat
the entire procedure.

I agree. That's why it uses external key managers.
This is the "main dialog".
If you create a new mail, in this dialog 2 new icons _should_
be available.
They are only visible in the "new mail" dialog.
OK, so far everything works.
That's weird. Even the menu entries are not visible?
The same should happen for 'New Mail', except the icons are different.
What exact Outlook version do you have? Did you apply any Service Packs?
GPGol needs at least SP2 (and 2003).
I'm familiar with the mailer+extension and GPGol should work likewise.
The problem is that Outlook is sometimes "intractable". That's why you
need to install at least SP2.
I currently do not maintain the project. If you use Outlook >= 2003
(SP2) and the problems still exist, it might be a good idea to
fill out a bug report at bugs.gnupg.org (gpgol).
No problem. When my time permits it, I always try to help.

I know I promised a beta days ago...but the code still needed some
work to be ready for beta testing.
A new GPGoe website will follow, I give more information when it's ready.
Now I managed to prepare a beta version and I'm interested to get some
feedback. Either on the interface but more if it works with the most
common Outlook Express versions. I tested it with OE from WXP/SP2 and
it works like a charm. And now sign+encrypt also works ;-).
The current code has limitations, for example you can't select the
signing key it always uses the default.
Download URL:
For people who want to test it, here are the _install instructions_:
1. you need an existing WinPT installation or better the DLLs that
   came with it.
2. unzip gpgoe-0.6.0-beta.zip in the same folder the winpt.exe
   (libgpgme-11.dll) is located.
3. start gpgoeinit.exe
   (you can end the program either with a right click->exit or a     double click)
4. start Outlook Express and make sure the "Encrypt" and "Sign"
   toolbar buttons are visible!
5. that's it.
a _quick introduction_:
how to encrypt:
new message->fill out all fields->select "Encrypt"->send
(if the email addresses can be found in the keyring, no interactive
 steps are needed otherwise a dialog is shown to select the recipients)
 how to sign:
 new message->fill out all fields->select "Sign"->send
 (the passphrase callback is shown to ask for the passphrase for the
  default signing key. Type in the passphrase)
 how to sign+encrypt:
 new message->fill out all fields->select "Sign"+Select "Encrypt"->send
 (the recipient dialog _might_ be shown and after it the passphrase   callback).

Some code has changed. Maybe it's not visible for the user.
Please can you post your exact OE version?
The code should output all text, but actually I never tried with very
long messages. I will check this again.
What do you mean by "not visible"? Copy copies the text in the clipboard
so you can paste it somewhere.
You mean you could not encrypt or sign in Outlook Express any longer?
The problem is, that the plug-in uses the clipboard for data transfer.
I've to admit that this isn't 100% clean but the only way and I also
see the problem. I will add this point to the README but for now there
is not much I can do.
Hmm, I tested all kind of message types and also a PGP/MIME message.
When no GPG data were found, no action should be performed. It works
on my system. Maybe you can forward me the test message which produces
the "no data" error?

@_subject: [Winpt-users] File wipe options 
Overwrite file with 2 random passes.
I'm not sure where you read this. But it is a well known problem
to delete data securely from hard disks. The file is overwritten
with random data but due to disk caches and other (technical issues)
there is still a risk that some portions of the file remain in
unscrambled on the hard disk.
(Peter Gutmann published an excellent paper about this problem)
The command does exactly what the description is saying. It wipes
out the free space of the selected hard disk. The current code uses a simple "trick" to achieve this. It creates
a temporary file and the size of this file is equal to the free disk
space(*). Then this file is overwritten with random pattern and at the
end the file is deleted. The only risk _could be_ that the temp file
remains on the disk and there is no free disk space. But WinPT tries
to delete the file whenever the procedure is cancelled.
   Timo
The code has a major problem on XP/NTFS. In general a user can't wipe
out the free space due to restrctions (quotas, privileges). The new
0.12.0 version (not yet released) provides code to check the
privileges of  the current user.

Today I released the version 0.12.1 of WinPT.
The version contains fixes for a lot of reports from users and
also a new keyserver searching interface. The new code should be
more realiable but as a restriction, it only works with modern
keyservers. So if you can back a "general error", I suggest to
set "subkeys.pgp.net" as the default keyserver. I did all my
tests with it and I did not have any problems.

Weird, I made a test and it worked. Maybe this is only a problem

I checked it again with a larger gpg.conf and you're right. For ordinary
gpg.conf files, this is no problem but when the file is longer than 2048
bytes, it will be truncated at 2047 bytes.

I guess it would be a good idea to post this on gnupg-users with
all details you have.
Which gpg version do you use? WinPT also uses unattended key generation
and it works (IMHO). In any case gpg >= 1.4.4 should be used.
I'm a little confused now. Your subject does not really fit to your message. What exactly you try to do and where is the problem?
Just a short summary:
- the passphrase is _NOT_ stored anywhere. Just the secret key
   which is encrypted by this passphrase. A hash is used to derrive
   a key from the input data (passwd).
- none of the usual gpg operations need user interaction
   (encrypt, sign, decrypt, verify, keygen)

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Possible broken Attachments 
on another list some folks reported that they have a problem
with received attachments, maybe somebody can confirm this?
Somebody encrypts a file (armor: JPG/ZIP) with the File Manager and
sends it to a recipient. The attachment is of course encrypted for
this recipient.
Now the recipient tries to decrypt the file. No errors, but the
output file is damaged. The gpg process on the console says that
it cannot handle lines longer than 19995 chars.
My first hint was that the mailer broke the line endings and thus
a very long line was the result which couldn't be handled by GPG.
But it seems that, on the machine of the tester, the problem also
occurs locally. Which means they encrypt the file, decrypt it and
the result is damaged on the local machine even without sending the
It would be nice if somebody could try to reproduce the problem
so I can see if the problem is WinPT or a possible (mailer) setting

first thanks for the response.
..few questions:
- did you use armor or just binary output?
- does it work with gpg on the command line (gpg -r foo -ea your_file, gpg your_file.gpg)?
- what is the gpg output if you try to decrypt the file, that was
   encrypted by the WinPT FM before?
- your gpg version?

the problem has been caused by the GnuPG textmode

enabled it there manually or how it was enabled.

fix the handling of binary data again.

============================== START ==============================
IMHO, not in the next time.
Werner said something about it on the gnupg-users mailing list. So you could visit the archive to find it. Sorry, I don't have an URL right now.
Of course gpg 2.0 has a lot of new features, but also bear in mind that there are not much Windows programs which would use them. Even WinPT cannot use the S/MIME functions without adjusting parts of the code.
Maybe I'm wrong, but I would say that there is no reason for most Windows(!) people to change to gpg 2.0 in the next time. gpg 1.4.x provides all kind of functions which are needed to provide secure email communication and data encryption. When somebody is *forced* to use S/MIME or a PKCS.11/X.509 based smartcard things are different.

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Wher is the PASSPHRASE STORED in GNU/GnuPG folder 
I'm a little confused.
For encryption, let's assume you mean public-key encryption, no
passphrase is needed. For symmetric encryption, it is stored in
(secure[if available]) memory.
GPGME would be a good start. It helps you with handling of the data
and the passphrase. But I suggest to read some general documentation
about GPG interprocess communication and the status-fd/command-fd

Any folder can be used.
Just delete the folder. And if you _really_ want to delete your keyrings

Ordinary system memory. And of course if anybody has admin access to

But this is nothing new and in reality, that's why you should have
a password for your account and no "remote services" which allow
users to login on your machine without authentication.

@_subject: [Winpt-users] where Is The PASSPHRASE STORED 
I've to admit that I'm confused a little.
Do you talk about a file/email which were encrypted+signed? Otherwise
it does not make any sense because the verify process does not need
any passphrase.
If my mails don't clarify the situation, I guess it would be the best
to start again with a detailled description of the problem and all kind
of logging and exact error messages.
And again, because Windows has no real secure memory, the passphrase
is stored in normal memory. And yes, I'm aware of VirtualLock() and
friends, but there are problems with the function. For details,
there was a discussion on gnupg-users some time ago.

@_author: Timo Schulz 
@_subject: [Winpt-users] Winpt-users Digest, Vol 13, Issue 1 
Is this a question? If you disable the passphrase cache, it is
just hold temporary for the operation.
No. The passphrase will be only cached when WinPT is _running_ and
the feature is _enabled_. And even then you have to enter it once
to enable caching. IF you quit WinPt, the cache will be flushed (deleted). So if you forget the passphrase, it's gone.
! This is why anybody should generate a key revocation certificate
   right after the key generation and store it on a safe place.
   *If* you lost your secret key/passphrase/something similiar
   you can import the revoc cert and make the entire key unuseable.
   Of course you need to send it to a key server then to spread the key. !

Of course I will fix serious problems, but I won't be able
to work on any new features or on any time consuming items
on the TODO list.
Another problem I cannot handle right now is the VISTA support.
I don't have a Vista system and this won't change for the next time.
And I know that not everybody out there is switching to Vista
immediately, but I even did not finish the XP support so WinPT is
behind its possibilities.
The project is _NOT_ dead, it is just frozen on indefinite time.
The project site is still active, also the primary download site
and this won't change in the future.
I thought it would be useful for you, all users, to know it. WinPT
is free software under the terms of the GNU General Public License,
but it seems that free software on Windows is still different handled
by developers. I'm aware that it works for *big* projects, like Mozilla,
but it seems WinPT wasn't important enough or shall I better say not
interested enough for other developers to join.

To summarize the entire situation: I don't have Vista and I've no

An attractive (and active!) Wiki would mean that we need a maintainer

I see your point and I know a wiki is a community project. But even so
it needs a little supervision to check the texts. Of course I don't
suspect people contribute wrong texts, but the mother of all Wikis
is a good example that texts needs to be reviewed from time to time.
It's worth to try and actually the gforge environment also has a wiki
plugin. And maybe the wiki will also help to remind people WinPT still
exists. It's worse enemy, right now, is the problem that the SF.net
WinPT (dead!) project is listed first in google and that there are not
much links to the winpt websites. Which makes the project, as a logical

The problem with the current window code is, that it depends on
"unstable" conditions. For example on same machines the code does
not seem to work at all, on some machines there are windows which
do not "allow" to paste the text back and sometimes it just does not
work even if it should. On my machine I never encountered any problems
but I heard from other users, who said the environment is equal or at
least very similar and on there machines it does not work.
Sometimes the current window loses the focus and then WinPT can't
paste it back. You should try again or use the menu entry instead
of the hot key.
I'm sorry to say that this issue cannot be easily fixed because the
feature relies on kind of a trick, which prevents that the functionality
can be assured. :-(

I did not succeed to spread the word so it was heard
by some developers, I have to act.
I've to say I'm really sorry to turn my back on the
Windows community, but right now there is not even
a single day I could spend on the project and it definitely
needs continuous support. The current situation is not
satisfying either for me or the users.
In the forum there are occasional posts with problems
and somebody needs to work on them, I don't have any
free time to do it. Plus, bugs need to be fixed.
So, as soon as the gpg4win project provides sufficient
support and facilities for the functions WinPT provides,
the project will be shutdown, also the website and the
mailing lists.
Even with financial aid, I don't believe it'll be possible
to provide continuous support for the project so without
a new programmer, as a designated successor, WinPT is supposed
to vanish into thin air :-(.

============================== START ==============================
after we fixed lots of _known_ problems and modernized the code
a _little_, we would like to update the language files. Due to the
age of those files, existing translations are practically useless.
I know the initial workload is high, but then only minor modifications
are needed. We want to be honest with you, the future of the project
is still unknown[1], but we believe that a working executable is much
better than the alternative. And to reach a larger audience, additional
translations would be very useful.

Time is our major problem. Currently we even have trouble to fix
all known problems and to work on support for Vista.  Plus,
the GUI needs usability improvements.
Without additional manpower, this feature will be postponed
for a long time :-(.

Hash: SHA1
Hello everyone,
FYI, the old 'STUD' website will be retired this month. The link of
the new WWW website can be found in the Public Area of the wald
project information of WinPT.
Currently the old website automatically forwards the user to the
new website. A simple language detection is implemented to provide
at least a German and an English version.
As mentioned in the forum, we plan to release 1.3.0 at the end of
the week. It contains lot of bug fixes for minor and some major
problems. There is still lots of work to do, but with this release
we want indicate that there is at least some progress and that the
project is not dead.
Due to a new build system, the preferred building environment is
now Win32+Gcc. The source code will utilize this environment. We plan
to enhance the system and merge the new code with the SVN repository

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Announcement for WinPT 1.3.0 
after more than two years the project had release a new version.
WinPT 1.3.0 is now available for download. Either at wald.intevation.org
or directly at the new site winpt.gnupt.de.
As noted at several sites, the release is a bug fix release. It does not
introduce any new features. We tried to fix the major problems and to disable features which caused trouble in the past.
Some of you probably noticed, that we also removed some features. We decided that WinPT should focus on OpenPGP functionality and leave other
tasks to dedicated programs. This way, the program will be more lightweight and easier to maintain.
Due to this reason we removed the 'Wipe Feature'. Secure file wiping is
a very complex task and not related to OpenPGP. There are dedicated, free(!) programs to perform this task and there is no need to provide such a feature in WinPT.

Nice to hear this. I already work on 1.3.1
to fix some more problems.
I'm not sure because, I'm not associated with it any longer.
Plus, some interfaces changed and we still need to backport
them to the stable WinPT SVN branch.

for all people who used 8-bit characters in their passphrases:
WinPT prior to 1.4.1 did not transmit the passphrase to GPG
in the expected format. As a result, you need to reset the
passphrase to plain US-ASCII and use WinPT 1.4.1 to change
your passphrase to the old passphrase again (now the 8-bit
characters will be handled properly).
There is a file (English, German) 8Bit-Passphrase.txt which
describes the procedure. WinPT 1.4.1 is available at Wald

Hi everybody,
it's the second time I've to say this and I'm sad about it:
_The project will be (temporary, but definitely for a longer time)
stopped and the support will be discontinued. The reasons are (again)
the lack of resources._
And with resources we do not mean web space or administrative
resources. The code base needs to be revamped and without
additional developers, not full time, but at least a fixed amount
of time per month, this isn't feasible in a reasonable time.
We would like to continue the project at some point in the future, but
without community help (developers in the first place) the restart might
take a very long time or might not happen at all.
WinPT 1.4.3 is the last release. It still can be downloaded from
winpt.gnupt.de. But it should be noted that the existence of the
site cannot be guaranteed any longer. But of course, it is always
possible to download older versions at the Wald development site.
As a result, I will close the list at the end of the month. I will
also add a hint on the project website about the new project status.
We thank all people for their trust and contributions.
Your WinPT team.

[This mail is a pre-notification. The blog site and the binaries may
 not be available _yet_. ]
Hi everyone,
because of the nasty "Blue Screen of Death" problem which is probably
related to an AV program, I decided to release a new beta version:
The release is scheduled for 19:00 (CET).
For your information, this version does not provide any new features
and is only supposed to help people with this particular problem.
If your winpt binary crashes, you may try the new version to see
if it fixes your problem. If so, some feedback (mail, blog) would
be really appreciated.

Hash: SHA1
first let me apologize that the blog site related to this mail is
currently only available in German. We are working on it :-(.
In short: We decided to re-launch WinPT. The full text, only available
in German, is available at .
For those, who don't speak German let me elaborate on it:
The project had reached a point where it did not make sense to
continue because no resources were available. Thus, a project "freeze"
made sense. And then we decided that we need to cleanup the code and
that a re-launch is only useful after the cleanup has been finished.
Plus, that we can guarantee that a minimal amount of resources will be
available for maintenance and further development.
To sum up the situation: we are working on a new release (1.5) and if
the community is interested that we continue beyond this release, we
will start a dialog with the users to discuss the a possible roadmap
for the project.
Any kind of feedback is welcome.
