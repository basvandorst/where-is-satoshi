@_subject: [Winpt-users] Why comes the binary archive without native language 
the archive winpt-0.11.9-exe.zip lacks both the instructions how to activate native language support and the translation files.
It took me some time to spot how to enable in particular German language I needed to download the corresponding source code archive, which contains both instructions (README) and the German language translation file Po/de.gmo
It turned out that these instruction are a little out of date:
1.  What is called .mo file in the instructions are actually .gmo files.
2.  GnuPG 1.4.2.2 now uses a different and simpler scheme. You just have to import a .reg file with the contents
    REGEDIT4
    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\GnuPG]
    ; Adjust the following line to your needs!
    "Lang"="de"
Are the commissions in the binary archive by accident or by intention?

This usefull link is new to me. Perhaps you could place it on the Gforge project page under the Summary tab. Here we have a difference between Gforce and SourceForge. On SourceForge a project page has a link "home page" in the navigation area.
Yes, I know.  At present for my taste GPG4win is too fat. Nevertheless I will think it over again.
