This is my first mail to the list, so hello to all!
It seems that I have the same problem since v0.11.4! In 0.11.3-cvs
everything works fine and I am able to change all directories in the
GPG settings. Since v0.11.4 and also in .5 the directory preferences
are not editable even if I check the "override default setting" box!
If I check the box and close the window, after reopening, the box is
unchecked again!

Thank you for the quick answer!
Is there the possibility to edit the paths manually? Where are these
entries stored?

Hello Timo,
You said you uploaded the first pre-release but I am not able to find
it! The last file I can see is 0.12.3! Would you please be so kind an

@_subject: [Winpt-users] WinPT 1.1 
Today I found, that WinPT 1.1.0 seems to truncate the GnuPG option
file to a size of 2047 Bytes when saving it! Does someone else can
confirm this behavior?
Best regards,

Hello Timo,
I tried it on two machines with the same result. My gpg.conf has 3361
Bytes because there are many comments in it (so this is not really a
problem for me!). If I go in Key Manager, Edit, Preferences, GPG
Options I directly can see the gpg.conf. Then I save it and the file
is truncated to 2047 Bytes, you can see it after a new load. I also
tried an different file larger then 2047, always the same, after
saving, the file has been cut!

@_subject: [Winpt-users] gpg.conf truncation 
Hello vedaal,
Your list has only 1710 bytes so there should be no truncation!

Hello Timo,
Thank you for the reply, like you said, normally a conf should not be
so large but in my case it was the standard file that was created
during GPG installation and there are many comments in it describing
the possible parameters.
Again many thanks for your excellent work!
Best regards,

Hello Timo,
I tried it with 3 PDF files (together about 100 MB) and have also a
problem with the zip after it has been decrypted again. The archive
seems to be corrupt!
Unfortunately 7Zip says only: "xxx.zip is not supported archive"

@_subject: [Winpt-users] How to calculate and see a hash value of any file 
I can not answer your question regarding a hash function in GPG but here you
will find a very useful freeware program for calculating hashes such as MD5,
SHA1 and many others!
Remark: There exists no relationship between me and the programmer!
