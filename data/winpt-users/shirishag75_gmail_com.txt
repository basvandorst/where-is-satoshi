@_subject: [Winpt-users] documentation about winpt and a wiki idea 
Hi there,
           First of all its kinda sad that people don't respect,understand
or know the importance of privacy to let such a good tool to go to waste.
Apart from that there seem to be some inconistency as far as documentation
itself is concerned. The link given at your site
produce a good .pdf Using the same link with the add-on
 it downloads/resolves to  the
gpg4win-1.0.6.tar.bz2 file. I also scanned the gforge site and came up with
these two links
 well as
 .
Could you or somebody else correct the link.
         Another view is have a wiki (I'm sure this has been talked about
before) but there is a possibility that people might contribute more if
there is an attractive wiki .  for
reference. With the GUI toolbar I don't see many people not doing it.
        I may have some query later on, but signing off for now. Adios
