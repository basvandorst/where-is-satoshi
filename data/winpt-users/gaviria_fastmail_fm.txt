Hi, Timo and listers!
Same here with "key manager / GPG / Preference".
Have not been able to reproduce the window which remains on the screen

A window remains on the screen foreground after winpt has started up. It
seems this is the "key caching" window. The window disapear after some
operation such as encrypt or decrypt. This window doesn't stay on screen
when the computer is rebooting (and winpt is loaded upon startup), but
it does when winpt is loaded explicitely.
Moreover, "key manager / GPG / Preference" results in a winpt crash.

@_subject: [Winpt-users] GPGoe 0.7.0 
Hash: SHA1
Hi Timo!
GPGOE v.0.7.0 has been exhibiting an erratic behavior in my machine. At times the verify box would not show up although text in the message was selected and copied to the clipboard.  I would not be able to sign/encrypt messages either.  This had not happened with previous versions, but it was just a coincidence.  I reinstalled beta3 and got the same behavior.
After some trial and error I found what seems to be the culprit: this would only happen if a program called "Free Download Manager" was loaded.  It makes sense since download managers usually look for internet addresses in memory and hence there would be some kind of conflict.
I am letting you know because I reckon many users will have some kind of download managers installed in their machines and this kind of erratic behavior will make them think that GPGOE does not work.
Also, what do you mean by "support for quoting the mail text"?
Best regards,
Juan Ignacio Gaviria

The problem is that GPGoe uses a low-level trick to integrate itself
into Outlook Express and in _some_ circumstances, it might be possible
that conflicts with other programs occur.
Thanks for the hint. I tried to make the "low-level" code safe as
possible, but it seems that it is more work done when some packages
are installed.
If you decrypt a mail and you want to use this text in the reply,
the problem is that there are no "> " to indicate the text is a reply.
With the quote feature, the entire text is prefixed with "> " + text.
Does this explaination makes it clearer or shall I be more precise?

This is very I think this error message is related to GPGOE v.0.8.0 working in the In case you can not get the attachement, this is my trnslation of what the message box contains:

A new version of the plug-in is now available.
It mainly introduces a feature to decrypt the mails
before the text is used in the reply. This fixes
the problem that a reply won't just contains the
encrypted text.
I also contains some bug fixes all over the place.

Because it might be possible that GPGoe's extended features
are in conflict with other programs, the new default behaviour
is to disable them all.
Via the popup menu in the taskbar program, you can enable them
manually if it works for you. Currently the only feature is
the "Allow plain text replies".
And for your information, it worked on the machines I tested it
without any problems. On the other hand, not too much extra software
was installed there . My hope is that the feature will work on most
machines and other can disable it, which means at least the core
functions are still useable.
And last but not least, I added a feature to check for known programs
which are in conflict with GPGoe. If the init program founds them,
a warning is issued and the user can decided if he wants to continue or
Any user which has problems with 0.8.0 should update to 0.8.1
as soon as possible.

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Consolidation, Differences, Overlap in Features, 
I share your thoughts about overlapping features in the programs included in
the gpg4win project.  This is rather confusing.
I had the opportunity to use what I think was the first WinPT installer,
along with the GPGOE plugin (for Outlook Express).  Sure, there were some
glitches in installing and configuring, but everything I needed semed to be
there (even a fairly good spanish *.mo).
Then I tried the GnuPT installer which included GPGrelay.  The installer
worked fine.  I went through all the steps and configured a Gmail account to
work with GPGrelay from inside Outlook Express and to smoothly accomodate my
SpamPal and Avast! requisites.  I had to use Stunnel and Open SSL.  It works
fine but I still keep my GPGOE plugin working and, frankly, I like this one
Finally, I downloaded the installer for the gpg4win project, for my office
computer, whose hard disk had been formatted.  No problems with the
instalation process, but there is plenty of redundant features with dictinct
interfaces which I do not think I need.  I uninstalled it and went back to
the GnuPt install program.
So, to tell you the truth, I am for a consolidation process, taking WinPT as
the "axis" and certainly I am for taking GPGOE development out of the
There is more:  I do not know if I am talking nonsense but I think that
Installing is required because some entries must be written to Windows'
registry.  If this could be avoided we would be able to use straight from a
memory stick (pendrive). That would be very nice, Timo.

[Several Questions and thought all rolled in to one e-mail so please
bear with me. Not directly related to WinPT but figured this was the
best place to start]
I have long been following WinPT  .  I have always
liked the interface, features etc.  The only thing I felt was missing
was in installer for people that were not comfortable with zipping and
extracting files.
At the same time with work I have had to use Outlook (& Exchange) so I
have had an interest in the development of GPGol
 but have not actually tried GPGol yet
as there was not a good installer and it seemed like it was still under
heavy development.
I see there is a new installer coming out called gpg4win
 that is in development that has the above
packages and others.  I am not clear what the current status of it is...
Is it stable, usable, creating appropriate icons and system entries?
I don't know much about the gpg4win project, but I hope the installer
gives a good brief description of each program  and allows the user to
chose if they want to install all or a subset of the programs.
There seems to be a fair amount of overlap in features between all the
programs part of the gpg4win project.  Can anyone delve into the details
of what and why certain programs made it into the project and
The old installer that some used had GPGRelay, but I did not see that
included. Why is that?
What I would love to see is the universal installer that sounds like it
is in development with a universal Keymanager etc.  Several of these
GnuPG shells have their own Keymanager when it seems like it would be
benifical to the user and devlopers if the same Key Manager (and other
common areas) use the same code.  So that WinPT, GPGol, GPA, GPGee, etc
all used the same common code and interface.
I know it may be out of the scope for some but it might be nice if the
gpg4win installer also came with Enigmail the Thunderbird GNUpg interface.
Sorry for the long e-mail, just wanted to get all my questions in one
place instead of several small e-mails.
What do others think of the consolidated Key Manager ideas?
I will be interested to hear about some of the other thoughts and
questions above.

Hi, Timo and listers!
I have kept the "old" GPGOE in my computer for several years (at home

course OE version has also changed in time.  I am glad to report that
it works with no conflicts at all.  It also works with the most

placing a shorcut to GPGOE dll loader in the startup folder.
Sadly, I also have to say that I have never been able to sign AND
encrypt my messages.

it and I think that GPGOE is a great tool.

It must be inside winpt-0.11.8.1-exe.zip. I double checked this.
The name of the dll is _not_ gpgme.dll but libgpgme-11.dll. Due
to the fact that other already confirmed that it works, you either
downloaded the wrong file or another problem occured.

Hi Timo!
I downloaded and tested GPGOE-beta and beta-1.
I was not able to see any difference betwen the two versions, except that I reckon beta-1 can be installed in a folder other than the one containing Now my messages sent with Outlook Express can be signed, encrypted and signed+encrypted. That's good news.
There seems to be a limitation in the message viewer, which will show only about 1,000 characters (about 150-170 words) of the decrypted message.  I checked using the "Copy" button on the viewer and pasting elsewhere and the message was there, but not visible.
During my testing I also tried to decrypt the encrypted message by copying it to the clipboard and using WinPT.  There seems to be a memory issue there, because GPGOE would not be available after using WinPT context menu. I had to close OE and open it again for GPGOE to work properly.
I also noticed that if I wanted to paste some text in a new OE message, I had to first open an empty file and then copy and paste.  I was not able to do it by first copying text then opening a new message and pasting the text in the empty message.  Nothing would happen.
There is one other thing that I am not sure happened with former version: OE reacts inmediately when I open a message received as an attachement to another message and the "GPG Plugin Error" (decrypt/verify: no data) small window plus the noise that goes with it is quite annoying.
My system: Pentium IV 2.4 GHz, 1,0 Gb RAM, 120 Gb HD, Windows Xp Pro SP2, OE v 6.00.2900.2180, WinPT v 0.11.9, GnuPG v 1.4.3-cvs.
I keep both WinPT and GPGOEInit shortcuts in my Stratup folder and they appear in my system tray.
Keep up your great work and thank you for maintaining your interest in this useful tool.

Hi, Timo!
Sorry for taking so long in answering.  I was out of town and could not check my mail.
You sure are fast at code-fixing.  I downloaded and tested beta2. The annoying "no data" message seems to be gone for good.
The limitation in the number of characters that the message viewer will show still persists.  It seems that you need to place the cursor inside the viewer and then use the PageDown key on the keyboard to see the full decrypted message (arrows in the keyboard or mouse scrollwheel will not do anything).  It is not about the messages being excesively long:  I was trying to decrypt your previous message to the list regarding GPGOE which I had encrypted and resent to myself.  May I suggest a scroll bar in the I tried to verify the signature for a message sent to the list by John Clizbe on March 22 and all I got was an empty message box for signature verification even though I imported Mr Clizbe's key.  Maybe a key was missing or invalid, but the message box did not help.
The memory (or clipboard) issue about not being able to copy text, opening a new message and pasting the text to the new message still remains there. You still have to open the message, then copying the text fragment and finally pasting.
All in all, a great job!  Please keep on it.
