(Just registered to the list.)
I just wanted to say that this latest version now encrypts correctly
files on my Pentium4 XP system. Version 0.11.8.0 seemed to hang when
It looks that the option "verify" does nothing.
in WinPT FileManager
   encrypt & sign  (file of 9mb):   => OK
   decrypt :    =>  OK (and shows a signature verification window)
   verify:    =>  nothing happens...

ref: Why comes the binary archive without native language support?
Hello Timo,
Interested in a french translation ?
If yes, just tell me how, I'll give it a shot.
Just be aware that french tends to be a language that ends up longer
then english.
