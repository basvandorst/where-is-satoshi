@_subject: [Winpt-users] Better errormessage when subkey is missing 
Hash: SHA1
I happened to have a keyring that wasn't updated when I tried to
decrypt a file. WinPT kept asking for the password - thought I might
have got it wrong, but I hadn't. When I checked with gpg on the
commandline I got a message that a certain subkey was missing. Thats
more helpful!

You've got it right.

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Cannot change home for GnuPG 
I cannot change the home catalog for GnuPG with the latest version (0.11.8) of WinPT. I use different keyrings at different locations and have to change the home catalog frequently.

When I open the Window for GPG settings the field for the home path is empty. I enter the new location, update the key cache, but still the old key ring is used. When I check the settings the path-window is empty once again.

I have checked the registry. The "old" settings persist in the
registry before and after trying to change the home directory. And
every time I open the GPG-settings in WinPT the field for the Home is empty.
