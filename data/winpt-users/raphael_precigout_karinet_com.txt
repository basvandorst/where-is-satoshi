@_subject: [Winpt-users] keycaching window remains after winpt startup 
A window remains on the screen foreground after winpt has started up. It seems this is the "key caching" window. The window disapear after some operation such as encrypt or decrypt. This window doesn't stay on screen when the computer is rebooting (and winpt is loaded upon startup), but it does when winpt is loaded explicitely.
Moreover, "key manager / GPG / Preference" results in a winpt crash.

It seems the "wipe original" doesn't work when using the File Manager
using winpt 0.10.4-beta (2005-10-26), gpg 1.4.3-cvs on win XP Pro SP2 + security patches.

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Passphrase caching doesn't work under some conditions 
The passphrase doesn't seem to be cached unless I previously decrypted something with my secret key :
1. start winpt, open the file manager, drag and drop a file to be encrypted, select "file" menu and "sign" --> doesn't work (the passphrase needs to be typed each time the secret key is used.
2. decrypt a file I already encripted with my public key (so that I do need my passphrase to be unlocked. --> since that step the passphrase caching works.
P.S. using winpt 0.10.4-beta (2005-10-26), gpg 1.4.3-cvs on win XP Pro SP2 + security patches.

Hi Timo,
Still having problems with passphrase caching, when using the 0.10.5 Open "file manager", drag and drop a file, right click and select sign : I type my secret key passphrase. (now my secret key should be in cache)
Do it once again, I have to type my secret key passphrase again !
Now I decrypt some file previously encrypted with my public key : I have to type my secret key passphrase (once again)
Since that point my secret key passphrase is in cache : signing or decrypting a file doesn't require me to type my secret key passphrase In fact it seems the secret key passphrase is cached only when it is used for decryption.

Perhaps it's not of any help, but when reloading the key cache makes the mysterious window appear with a different label (1240996 / 2010221529) instead of previously mentionned which appears only the first time I lauch WinPT.

Hi Timo,
The mysterious window is still there... it appears after reloading the keycache and remains in the midle of the screen until I decrypt or verify a file's signature. The window indicates:
0                /    13210774
The wipe function works well and the passphrase caching too. Thanks to you.

Hello Timo,
Using a long passphrase for my secret key doesn't work ; Winpt always says "bad passphrase".
To be concrete it doesn't work for a 57 characters passphrase but it works fine for a 9 characters passphrase. I don't know what is the limit...
WinPT 1.0.0pre3, GPG 1.4.5
I do not have this problem with WinPT 1.0.0pre0, GPG 1.4.5

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Long passphrase pb with WinPT 1.0.0 and solution 
my long passphrase (59 characters) still doesn't work for me with WinPT 1.0.0 GPG 1.4.5 on Win XP Pro SP2.
9 chars long passphrase are OK
Found a solution (and a possible hint) :
when trying to set the same passphrase on another key with WinPT, I have the following message : "The passphrase contains 8-bit characters. It is not suggested to use charset specific characters. Continue ?" Answered Yes, repeated the passphrase again. Passphrase changed successfully.  From now on the long passphrase is working fine with WinPT 1.0.0 (final) GPG 1.4.5
Back to my production key use winpt pre0 to change the passphrase to a dummy one like foobarbaz. Load winpt 1.0.0, change the passphrase again to my previous passphrase.
The only problem is that my long passphrase set with winpt 1.0.0 doesn't work anymore with winpt 1.0.0pre0. Well I will have to update my binaries on other computers to the last release of winpt (1.0.0 for all)
