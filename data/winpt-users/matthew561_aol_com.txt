Hash: SHA1
 Hello
Using WinPT 0.11.2 GPG 1.4.3 cvs.  Home XP SP1.
I am getting the mystery dialogue box that won't go away until I
close WinPT.  If I sign a message I have "GPG Status Finished" left hanging in the middle of my screen.  When this happens I have
to click on the task box and then the WinPT key icon to get the
menu that you normally get by simple right clicking.

In a message dated 12/22/2005 12:03:51 PM Central Standard Time, I can do it with 0.11.2, which I am using because  0.11.3 crashes as it opens (caching keys).  I am using Home XP SP 1

In a message dated 12/30/2005 9:11:46 AM Central Standard Time, Like 0.11.3, 11.4 crashes upon loading (it dies during the opening key cache).  It will check sigs, but try to load the program is a no go.  Last version that worked for me was 0.11.2.
I am running Home XP SP1. GPG 1.43

In a message dated 12/30/2005 1:24:04 PM Central Standard Time, You already have an existing WinPT environment and you just updated
the binaries? I ask to check if WinPT tries to create the needed
registry entries and pathes (and this causes the crash)...
Can you replace 0.11.4 (WinPT.exe) with 0.11.2 and it works again?
(without changing anything else)
Yes, I have used WinPT since the beginning of time so all I did/do was/is overwrite files.
No problem going back to 0.11.2.

In a message dated 10/26/2005 1:39:06 PM Central Standard Time, Started out with a "clean" install of WinPt 10.03 Beta and GPG 1.4.3.cvs.  Created a test message.  Clicked on current window and sign.  Get passphrase form, entered it and WinPT crashes.  It sort of worked one timeonly  but it didn't paste signed message back into client, but that is as close as it has ever came to working for me. Have moved back to WinPT 10.01

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Signing crash 
In a message dated 10/28/2005 12:01:16 AM Central Standard Time, I have three keys (including one RSA), and normally it always crashed.  I just tried it again and it worked using the clipbroad, and surprising sort of worked with current window but would not paste back into client (had to do it manually). Normal behavior, however, is to crash.

The path to the keyrings is wrong in the GPG preferences WinPT Dialogue, but it won't let me change the path. It and the GPG location are grayed out.

I see the "overwrite default settings" option: however while letting me change directories it isn't saving the changes.  The next time I open the preference dialogue, the "default" settings have replaced my changes.  The default settings for the keyrings is not correct for my system but at the same time GPG/WinPT loads my keyrings correctly!!??  FWIW, strange as it may sound when I open WinPT and use Current Window operations in one application it won't work again in another unless I close WinPT and reopen it.  That is the best I can explain it.

In a message dated 4/8/2006 6:36:35 AM Central Standard Time, twoaday at gmx.net I tested it and I guess something is different on your machine. What I did:
- open the GPG prefs and change the home dir to "c:\gnupg" -> OK.
- open the Key Manager and the keys are read from c:\gnupg\pubring.gpg.
- open the GPG prefs. the settings were stored -> OK
       (checked the registry: likewise).
- open the GPG prefs again. change settings to $APPDATA\gnupg -> OK.
  (checked the registry: value changed).
- the Key Manager reloads the key and shows the keys from
  $APPDATA\gnupg\pubring.gpg  Now the problem is to find out what is different on your machine.
I once again tried to reset keyring path, WinPT would still not let me change fron default, but it asked me to "pick at least one fully trusted key", I picked my own of course and now WinPT will not work for me at all.

In a message dated 1/17/2006 5:44:01 AM Central Standard Time, The feedback from here is the same as with every upgrade since 11.2, it crashes right upon opening right after it tries to cache the keyrings.  I had previously sent you a Dr,Watson log about this problem and it is still there.

In a message dated 1/20/2006 9:00:48 AM Central Standard Time, If I move my pubring and try to start WinPT 11.6 I can get to the dialogue where it will allow me to overwrite the "default" preferences (GPG is in \gnupg on my system) but when it goes to the next step, it crashes as usual.  If I try to restart the "default" preferences are back as if not edited - the only way I can 11.6/5/4/3 to run is to discard both keyrings and start from scratch.
Have gone back to 11.2

In a message dated 6/21/2006 2:55:01 AM Central Standard Time, Just tired to use new version.  Had old problem of the Gnupg status dialogue not closing.  It just hangs in the middle of screen and will not go away.  The WinPT tray icon will not function when this happens and the only way to get rid of it all is to shut down WinPT via task master.  Had this problem several versions ago.

However, it didn't work with 0.12.0 and or 0.12.1.  The strange thing is that they worked okay with sigs they themselves generated.

As to who "they" are - they would be 0.12.0 and 0.12.1.  The last download I got that would validate your sig on the zip was  0.11.12 but like I said, strangely, in signing msgs locally the "12"s worked fine.  The only time I got the Ohhhhh Jeeez error was on the distro zip.

Bill expressly my sentiment perfectly.
FWIW, since WinPT is such a crucial portion of GPG4WIN how it it
"survive" if WinPT isn't supported?
At any rate, many many thanks for all your hard work Timo!!
