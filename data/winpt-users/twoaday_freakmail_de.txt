@_subject: [Winpt-users] Announcement for GPGoe 0.8.0 
A new version of the plug-in is now available.
It mainly introduces a feature to decrypt the mails
before the text is used in the reply. This fixes
the problem that a reply won't just contains the
encrypted text.
I also contains some bug fixes all over the place.

@_subject: [Winpt-users] Updated 0.12.1 binary 
============================== START ==============================
due to a mistake the wrong binary was uploaded. The uploaded
binary did not include a single patch and thus a crash in the
key edit dialog is very likely.
(Thanks to vedaal for reporting this)
I fixed the problem and suggest to download the binary again.
