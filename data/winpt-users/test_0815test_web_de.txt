@_subject: [Winpt-users] Announcement for WinPT 0.11.12 
Hi Timo,
I discovered a tiny 'bug' in the message digest "save" routine. The
last two characters of the correctly calculated SHA-256 digest are
neither stored into the file nor copied to the clipboard, i.e. only
62 out of 64 characters are saved.
This isn't a new bug that appeared in WinPT 0.11.12, it was also
present in earlier versions of WinPT.
