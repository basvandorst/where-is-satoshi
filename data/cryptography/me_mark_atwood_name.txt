Well, there are Protobufs, and there is Thrift, and there is
MessagePack, and there is Avro...

YAML is a superset of JSON, is more human readable, and, unlike JSON,
has internal references.

@_subject: [Cryptography] New free TLS CA coming 
So Mozilla et al have been giving CAcert the runaround for over 4 years
now, and then suddenly they create a more centralized less audited
"Let's Encrypt" shows up, and it's welcomed into the root?
How... interesting.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Of writing down passwords 
For devices and boxes, such as racked machines, routers, switches,
internet'd "things", and home routers, I absolutely do write down the
random password I set on the device.  And then I securely tape the paper
that has the password written on it, along with all the other key
configuration and identification for that device, *TO* the device.
Once someone has physical access, they p0wn it anyway, so I might as
well instead make life easier for whoever is going to maintain or
reconfigure it, especially when that whoever is likely going to be
"future me".

@_subject: [Cryptography] TSA Blows Off Suggestion To Encrypt Boarding 
As soon as I first saw a PDF417 2d barcode on my boarding pass, I
scanned and decoded it.  It's got nothing that isn't also printed in
human readable text on the boarding pass, with no signature.   I then
found the IATA standards doc for boarding passes.
This means, of course, that one can fake up sets of boarding passes with
different info printed than in the barcode.
Imagining what this enables, is left as an exercise to the reader...
Somehow I really doubt that the TSA's barcode reader at each TSO station
is connected realtime to all the airlines' passenger manifest databases,
especially since those databases are in flux until the moment the
jetbridge door is closed.
One of the what might have beens, is that a friend of mine who does IT
research for the IATA told me that prior to 9/11, the IATA was, in
parallel with talking out the standard that led to PDF417s on boarding
passes, also talking out a way to optionally eliminate the boarding pass
entirely: by allowing the terminal at the boarding gate to read the MICR
OCR lines on a passport or driver's license or similar known ID card. A
passenger could have opt'ed to use a boarding pass, or to just use their
existing ID.

You also need to show this to a machinist, and ask him how easily it
could be made with circa 1936 machine tools.
Remember, no CNCing.
I'm looking at this Plot Device, trying to imagine machining the "boat

having each device be a "it takes a master machinist.  A week. Each. Per
