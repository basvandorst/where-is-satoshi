@_subject: ECRYPT Workshop on RFID and Light-Weight Crypto 
************** CALL FOR PARTICIPATION **************
ECRYPT Workshop on RFID and Light-Weight Crypto
         IAIK, Graz University of Technology , Austria
The use of state-of-the-art cryptographic methods on
RFID tags opens a new range of applications for these
tags and for cryptography.
The aims of the workshop are to increase the awareness
for cryptographic methods and solutions among RFID
developers, and for the requirements of this heavily
constrained environment among cryptographers.
The scope includes, but is not limited to, the following
     * Applications for RFID tags
     * Cryptographic algorithms for constrained environments
     * Cryptographic protocols adapted to RFID applications
     * Low-power implementations
There are contributed and invite talks. Gildas Avoine,
Dieter Gollmann,  Ari Juels and Johannes Wolkerstorfer
are confirmed as invited speakers.
For more information about the workshop program, location
and the  registration procedure, please look at:
The workshop is sponsored by ECRYPT - The European Network
of Excellence in Cryptology, Siemens and Philips.

@_subject: AES timing attacks, why not "whiten" the implementation? 
The article was published last year on SAC and is a decent
description of how to mask the AES SubBytes operation.
It tailored to prevent power analysis and EM attacks.
I have written a paper about an equivalent but slightly
optimized masking scheme myself.
 From my point of view, if only the table lookup causes
the timing leakage in some AES implementations, the most
practical masking approach to get rid of this problem is
to just mask this table lookup.
This is the difference to masking to prevent power analysis
or EM attacks -- there really every step needs to be masked.
These things are theoretically interesting but practically
of limited value. Efficient AES hardware implementations, in
case that efficient means small, make use of composite field
arithmetic. The difference between the different ways to
define the composite fields leads then to a negligable difference
in practice.
