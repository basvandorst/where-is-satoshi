Hello Dave,
teraflops here and there?
a) What kind of systems are these HPC systems ?
b) How are the TFLOPS being achieved (100s of GPUs or 1000s of x86/SPARC
CPUs or custom CPU fabric) ?
c) What is the networking backbone - Infiniband, Gigabit Ethernet, Myrinet ?
d) Are they all floating point ops ? Then you need to solve problems
that require lots of floating point calculations.
Some that I know of and worked with are listed here:
1. Computational Fluid Dynamics related software (can be both GPU and/or
CPU centric)
2. Neural Networks (certain types)
3. Software leveraging Genetic Algorithms for optimization
4. Traveling salesman problem solutions
5. Evolutionary Algorithms to solve NP-hard problems approximately
6. Finite Element Analysis for aircrafts, cars, ships etc.
7. Monte Carlo simulations in Cancer Research (not just Financial
8. Distributed Video Processing (GPU centric)
Hope this helps. Contact me if you need more info.
Vikas Kumar.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Bug in Signal - and what it says about, 
This has nothing to do with programming in general or the C language but
a bad development practice.
Everywhere in pretty much most of libc the APIs use "size_t" to
represent length. Using "int" to represent length is a throwback to K&R
C. This just shows that the developer has not updated his or her
understanding of the current state of the C language and its idioms. It
is more likely that the developer was getting warnings from the compiler
and used the "(int)" to get rid of the warnings.
Instead the developer should have done this:
ssize_t remainingData = file.length() - mac.getMacLength();
This way on a 64-bit machine ssize_t would be signed 64-bits and the
overflow would not occur.
