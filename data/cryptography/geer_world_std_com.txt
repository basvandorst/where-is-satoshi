[1] National ID in Development
USA Today, 22 January 2002
Federal and state groups are moving to create a national ID card that
contains fingerprints or magnetic strips, according to officials at the
Justice Department and General Services Administration. According to a
recent poll, 54 percent of adults support the creation of a national ID
card. The figure is lower than those of polls from two month ago, in
which two-thirds of adults supported such a move. A group of state
officials, meanwhile, is seeking congressional approval to standardize
documents for verifying identity when issuing driver's licenses.  Sen.
Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) has proposed federal funding for developing
driver's license standards, including studies on fingerprints, palm
prints, iris scans, face scans, or DNA.  Durbin's proposals also allow
motor vehicle authorities to access databases from the INS, the Social
Security Administration, and unspecified law enforcement agencies. The
bill would make the driver's license more reliable, he said. Similarly,
the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators wants Congress
to pass laws to fund a data-sharing network between the license
agencies and federal agencies. Privacy advocates believe that the
public will eventually come out in opposition of a national ID system.
[2] ****Computer Security, Biometrics Dominate NIST Agenda
By Brian Krebs, Newsbytes.
WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A.,
16 Jan 2002, 4:33 PM CST
The events of Sept. 11 and the subsequent anthrax attacks have caused a
major shift in priorities for the National Institute of Standard &
Technology, prompting the agency to double its efforts to develop new
standards for everything from security scanners to biometrics to
computer security, the agency's new chief said today.
NIST Director Arden Bement said while many of the projects were begun
prior to Sept. 11, the non-regulatory agency's new role in the Bush
administration's Homeland Security initiative has added a sense of
urgency to the mix.
"September 11 really focused our activities and gave them a sense of
immediacy," Bement said in a meeting with reporters today. "Our primary
goal now is to take whatever technologies are available for application
and to develop standards and test methods (that will) make them
available to the public as quickly as possible."
Bement said NIST is just a few months away from announcing a new
biometric standard that will be used to confirm the identity of people
seeking U.S. visas or using a visa to enter the United States.
NIST also is working with the Biometric Consortium, which represents
hundreds of companies that are developing technologies to identify
people by their individual physical characteristics, such as
thumbprints, facial recognition technology, iris and retinal scans.
The biometric standards chosen by NIST could allow one or two
technologies to gain early adoption and a strong foothold in an
increasingly crowded market. Bement said biometric identifiers are
being considered as a prerequisite for entry into government buildings,
and the states are pushing ahead on a plan to link an as yet
undetermined biometric technology to identity cards and driver's
NIST also is working to develop more effective security standards for
wireless communication networks, and is prepared to assume an even
greater role in developing computer security standards for the federal
"I expect that role will expand significantly," Bement said.
NIST recently released an updated standard for encryption technology
that will soon be used to beef up security for a range of electronic
transactions, from e-mail to e-commerce to ATM withdrawals.
The agency also is bracing for more responsibility over the computer
security standards adopted by the federal civilian agencies.
Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., chairman of the House Government Reform
subcommittee on technology and procurement policy, is drafting
legislation to reauthorize the Government Information Security Reform
Act, a law passed in November 2000 that requires federal agencies to
assess and test the security of their non-classified information
Davis plans to add a provision to the bill that would require NIST to
establish minimum technology and security standards that all agencies
must follow.
NIST also is crafting new standards to protect the nation's most
critical infrastructures, Bement said. The software that monitors and
regulates the distribution of juice over the national power grid, for
example, is not yet completely integrated.
"Grid control is a major issue now ... because a lot of the monitoring
of power flows on the grid is done with different types of software and
standards," Bement said.  "There's a fair amount of work necessary to
raise the level of security so it can't be taken down by hackers or
otherwise interrupted."
In addition, NIST has helped to re-assess standards for machines that
irradiated mail in the wake of last year's anthrax attacks, and is
reviewing standards that will govern some 2,000 new metal detectors to
be installed at the nation's airports.
While NIST is eager to have many of its new security standards adopted
by companies in the private sector, the future of the Advanced
Technology Program - the Commerce Department arm that provides support
for moving experimental technologies from the laboratory into the
marketplace - remains in question.
Many House lawmakers have for years advocated terminating the ATP, and
Commerce Secretary Donald Evans has said he would like to see the ATP
recoup more of its investment from private sector companies.
Benjamin Wu, deputy undersecretary for technology at Commerce, said
Evans has come to recognize that the program has its merits.
"He feels strongly that - irrespective of the funding issues - the
reforms he would like to propose will help bring stability to the
program," Wu said.
Bement said he was optimistic that NIST would get all the funding it
needs to handle its expanded role.
"There are a number of pending bills that not only better define this
role with regards to homeland security but also provide additional
funding," he said. "So far, we've got a pretty big plate of activities,
and we're prepared to even do more."

Not arguing, but the hardware cost curve for storage has a shorter

corresponding halving time for bandwidth is shorter still.
If that relationship holds up over a period of years, today's
tradeoffs between cache, re-computation, and anticipatory
transmission would presumably change in the direction the
economics dictates.
And of course, if I really care that a particular piece of data
is non-discoverable I either have to encrypt it, never transmit

The population can be rather easily bought to do this, coercion

NJ Turnpike:  You get a discount for using "EZ Pass"[1] and
there are, of course, records involved[2].  Since there are
generally credit card accounts to which the Passes are billed,
the 90 day limit for credit card dispute might seem to be a
sufficient time to keep said records as the payment for road
use can be fairly said to be complete at 91 days.  Well, no;
those records are kept for seven years.  As the EZ Pass system
is just exactly the same system as is in place in Massachusetts
but under the name "Fast Lane," one should probably assume records
are simply kept in a uniform fashion := max(applicable state regs).
Of course, the credit card companies are already in very highly
regulated record retention regimes in any case.

Noting the close similarity between spam and denial of service,
it is worth remembering that there is a fundamental tradeoff
between authorization requirements and vulnerability to DoS
in that the work factor I can impose on you is proportional
to the amount of labor I can cause you to voluntarily perform
before you can make your GO/NOGO decision on my authorization
for further service.  Adding work factor the better to ensure
that no unauthorized services are performed paradoxically
increases your vulnerability to DoS in that I can ask for
that pre-authz work to be done as often as I like.

@_subject: Question on the state of the security industry 
I shared the gist of the question with a leader
of the Anti-Phishing Working Group, Peter Cassidy.
Specifically, I shared this fragment:
------- Part One
I think the reason that, to date, the security community has
been largely silent on phishing is that this sort of attack was
considered a confidence scheme that was only potent against
dim-wits - and we all know how symathetic the IT
security/cryptography community is to those with less than
powerful intellects. Also, it is true, it was considered a
sub-set of SPAM.
The reliance on broadcast spam as a vehicle for consumer data
recruitment is remaining but the payload is changing and, I
think, in that advance is room for important contributions by
the IT security/cryptography community. In a classic phishing
scenario, the mark gets a bogus e-mail, believes it and
surrenders his consumer data and then gets a big surprise on his
next bank statement. What is emerging is the use of spam to
spread trojans to plant key-loggers to intercept consumer data
or, in the future, to silently mine it from the consumer's PC.
Some of this malware is surprizingly clever. One of the APWG
committeemen has been watching the devleopment of trojans that
arrive as seemingly random blobs of ASCII that decrypt
themselves with a one-time key embedded in the message - they
all go singing straight past anti-virus.
Since phishing, when successful, can return real money the
approaches will become ever more sophisticated, relying far less
on deception and more on subterfuge.
------- Part Two
You can also tell them that the Anti-Phishing Working Group was
organized in Nov 2003 to investigate, quantify and propose
solutions (drawing from off-the-shelf technologies) to the
phishing threat. It now has 500 members from banks, ISPs,
payment processors, federal law enforcement (US, UK, Canada and
Australia) - some 300 companies and agencies in all. You'd
recognize some of the individuals involved. I am coordinating
the research effort. Among the committee chairs is Phillip
Hallam Baker who is heading up the Solutions Evaluations
subcommittee whose work is being synchronized with the FSTC and
its member banks. Description of the APWG's committee's system
The Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) is an industry
association focused on eliminating the identity theft and fraud
that result from the growing problem of phishing and email
spoofing. The organization provides a forum to discuss phishing
issues, to define the scope of the phishing problem in terms of
hard and soft costs, and to share information and best practices
for eliminating the problem. Where appropriate, the APWG will
also look to share this information with law enforcement.
The research and cross-disciplinary investigations into
phishing, related pre-texting scams and subterfuge schemes to
animate identity thefts and subsequent illicit transactions are
driven by seven sub-committees. Each sub-committee has its own
chairs, writes its own agenda in coordination with the APWG
executive committee and organizes its own research for
presentation to the plenary at meetings and through the APWG
members Web site: Though the lion's share of the APWG is being driven by member
experts and practitioners within the committee system, the APWG
foresees many opportunities for extramural collaborations such
as the Working Group has already initialized with the Financial
Services Technology Consortium (FSTC) and others. As well, where
appropriate, the APWG will be recruiting visiting fellows and
expert practitioners to contribute research if relevant
expertise to complete it cannot be recruited from the ranks of
the APWG membership. To date, the seven standing committees to
have formed are:
- Solution Evaluation and Trial - Best Practices - Education - Future Threat Models and Forensics - Phishing Repository, Data Streams and Alerts - Sizing and Quantifying the Problem - Working with Law Enforcement
