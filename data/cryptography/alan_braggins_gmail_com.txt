@_subject: [Cryptography] /dev/random is not robust 
Given that we're assuming the device can't reliably generate a secure key pair,
and assuming that it doesn't already have a secret specific to the device, what
protocols would be suitable for doing that?
(And if we can ask a device to generate keys and securely migrate them to us,
we can ask it to generate some random seed material that isn't visible to an
attacker, which solves the problem of local generation.)

That was my initial reaction, but I was hoping there was something I'd
It doesn't mean the approach is useless though. Even if you have a weak
session key (based on, say, clock time, a serial number, and a "secret"
shared by all devices of this class, input to a KDF), an attacker can
find the key, but not trivially, and they have to use it to attack
perhaps just one message where the long term private key is provisioned.
That's in some ways better than generating a weak long term
private key. (But maybe worse if it gives you a false sense of
On the other hand, having one device with well-audited RNG with real
physical randomness, and well-audited key generation, provisioning lots
of products whose PRNGs you aren't too sure of even when seeded with
that un-intercepted local traffic, might have some value.

Which says of the original design: "Investigators determined eventually that this design supported only 60 percent of the minimum load required by Kansas City building codes.[19]", though the reference seems to be a dead link. (And as built it supported 30% or the required minimum.)
So even if it had been built as designed, the safety margin would not
have been "well within the margins used in building such structures".

@_subject: [Cryptography] The hypothetical random number generator backdoor 
Are you talking about or hypothetical RNGs in general, maybe not even EC based?
For an RSA key exchange without ephemeral DH, the _client_ generates
the premaster secret from which the session key is derived.
However, ClientHello and ServerHello both contain random numbers sent
before key exchange. If you are intercepting traffic, you have a nonce generated
shortly before the session key generation for every key exchange, even without
starting sessions of your own.
Possibly you can use the client nonces to reduce the search space for
the session
keys (and if it's an RC4 session key, maybe the biases in RC4 help?).
(Or, if using DHE, maybe it helps find DH private keys.)
And possibly if you have server nonces based on the same PRNG seed as was
used when the RSA key was generated, you can search for the RSA key.

"Problems with Dual_EC_DRBG were first described in early 2006"
With hindsight, it was definitely a mistake. The questions are whether
they could or should
have known it was a mistake at the time and whether the NSA played any
part in the mistake,
and whether they should have warned users and changed the default well
before now.

I've seen another version of that story that adds an important detail,
but I don't know which version is correct.
The other version is that there were codes added to ensure that US
nukes deployed in other NATO countries could only be launched with
co-operation of both the US and the "host" country, and those codes always all zeroes for nukes that were under exclusive US control.
The all zero code was not really a "launch code"; launching a missile
involved a lot more than checking that code:

Their proof of concept story seems even more trivial -
    "I've proven it's possible," he said. "It's crude. It won't scale.
     It probably has security vulnerabilities galore, but I've proved we
     can terminate SSL connections even if we don't have physical access
     to the private SSL key."
I'm sure there is engineering work involved in then making sure it scales to a cloud with lots of servers which have keys that should be under the control of different remote users, and you have to make sure your communications with the HSM-equivalent are suitably secured in a way that doesn't just give you a target equivalent to the server keys, but none of that seems like fundamental innovation.

Only 10 years for the nCipher netHSM, 18 years ago was SCSI devices,
and you were expected to buy one for each server machine :-)
But while Azure and AWS both support using HSMs with cloud appliances,
neither of them support keeping the HSM in the customer's physical control,
as far as I know.
My guess is that anything that is interesting and new about the scalability and
ease of management, they want to avoid going into detail about, so somebody
in marketing has been stuck with the job of selling a new feature
without actually
explaining what's really new.....
The "it's still OpenSSL, but now it's non-blocking" bit you couldn't
get off the shelf
from nCipher. OpenSSL support, and a native non-blocking API, but pick one.
