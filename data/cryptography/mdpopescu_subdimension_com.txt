@_subject: It won't happen here (was Re: TCPA/Palladium -- likely future implications) 
Now I know the general opinion of AARG, and I can't say I much disagree. But
I want to comment on something else here, which I find to be a common trait
with US citizens: "it can't happen here". The Chinese gov't can do anything
they like, because any citizen who would try to "keep watch" would find
himself shot. What basic law of the universe says that this can't happen in
the US? What exactly will prevent them, 10 years from now, to say
"compelling state interests require that we get to do whatever we want with
the little box"? You already have an official "gov't against 1st ammendment"
policy, from what I've read.

@_subject: Ross's TCPA paper 
I have an application that replaces the caption on the "I agree" button to
your liking; I wrote it exactly because of this reasoning.
Of course, it's a stupid little program, I'm sure anyone can come up with
something better in no time... BTW, for any lawyers around here - shouldn't
the mere existence of this program be enough to blow up the idea that you
agreed to the click-through stuff?
