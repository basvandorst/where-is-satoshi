Seeking original paper by satoshi nakamoto  posted by satoshi at
vistomail.com  The current version
of the whitepaper uploaded on Sourceforge is from 2009-03-24. This is the
second version of the whitepaper. The first version was published on
2008-10-31. It was uploaded to  which is where
the current version also resides. Did anyone here happen to download and
save it?
Does anyone have the original 2008 version of the whitepaper which was
posted to this mailing list on Oct 31 2008/Nov 1 2009?

This looks like it. It has the older phrase "without the burdens" in the
abstract that was posted to this mailing list in 2008 rather than the newer
"without going through"

I was very interested to read your b-money page.  I'm getting ready to
release a paper that expands on your ideas into a complete working system.
Adam Back (hashcash.org) noticed the similarities and pointed me to your
I need to find out the year of publication of your b-money page for the
citation in my paper.  It'll look like:

Title: Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party
Abstract: A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow
online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without the
burdens of going through a financial institution.  Digital signatures
offer part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted
party is still required to prevent double-spending.  We propose a solution
to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.  The network
timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without
redoing the proof-of-work.  The longest chain not only serves as proof of
the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest
pool of CPU power.  As long as honest nodes control the most CPU power on
the network, they can generate the longest chain and outpace any
attackers.  The network itself requires minimal structure.  Messages are
broadcasted on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the
network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of
what happened while they were gone.

Is it a better xapo or cold storage replacement that a hot wallet of btc
Sounds like an asset backed secure wallet more so than a cryptocurrency

I took a whack at it a while back and implemented a TweetNaCl-based system that runs in a browser.  It got very little positive feedback when I first announced it so I stopped working on it, but it would not take a lot of encouragement for me to pick it back up again.
