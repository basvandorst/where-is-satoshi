To be fair,  most commercial CA's require evidence of "right to use"
a FQDN in an SSL server cert.  But your point is apt.

Because insufficient case law exists -- some lawyers are bright
enough to see "pools of liability" with software, esp. known
vulnerabilities used in DDOS, etc. -- and we technologists are
not a litigious bunch.
What do you call someone who had a C average in law school?  "Your honor."
That's probably the other problem.
