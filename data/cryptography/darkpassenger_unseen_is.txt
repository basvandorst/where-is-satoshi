Hello ,
is there a paper with crypto details explaining why NIST chose Rijndael MARS (from IBM), RC6 (from RSA Laboratories), Serpent (from Ross Eli Biham and Lars Knudsen) and Twofish (from Bruce Schneier, John Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall and Niels Ferguson) as the AES ?

Thank you and the list for responses -- although they all were pointing to one
same source , which is NIST's own report .
for my own reasons , i do not trust NIST's crypto opinion , therefore i make my
question a bit more clear :
are there papers and studies apart from NIST or other usg bodies with approach between the algos i mentioned in my original mail , and the study results
in some kind of rationale that cryptoanalitically Rijndael was a better choice ?

thanks for the answer . please take a look at the original mail . i didnt ask about NIST's rationale .
but in this mail i am going to ask the same question with different sentences hopefully in helps
NIST says they had security , speed and algo characteristics where the bases of their tests on these algos
i am going to remove the third item from my question , its useless for my purpose .
now this is the question : are there independent , non-usg funded comparative cryptoanalysis anywhere ever done
over the past decade and a half , to examine the results of NISTs seperetly , whether come to same conclusion of
a different one ?
truthfully , i had my challenges with google already -- obviously . coudlnt find such thing . until now what i
got is linked to AES's official book and NIST's report , which both have been read before and are totally
IRRELEVANT to my question , yes ? i have plans for this thread of mails and hopefully step by step share
more about my study and my view on current state of AES . but it all starts with the basic original question .
has this been tested against others somewhere else other than a .gov funded and is such paper or combinations
of papers could be produced to finally guys here -- with common sense , realize that NIST with selecting
Rijndael had only intentions that it states in its own paper . and due those criteria , Rijndael , was the best
choice . eventually proving no hidden agenda , no very sneaky crypto job that makes our kind of people
convinced its safe enough but some other powerful player who doesnt have good history in our field is doing
satanic laugh for like 15 years now because in their true view Rijndael wasnt truly the best choice , it was
just selected and promoted and backed by .gov for a hidden agenda . with my original question i am trying
to remain objective and look for various kinds of evidence as much as possible before a educated guess or
conclusion .

i am not well researched on the whole enigma fisco . would anybody point me to a modern implementation of the machine in software emulating mode and the solver - preferably in cpp , py , ruby , ocaml

@_subject: [Cryptography] Security Standard for Safety Critical Software 
afaik within some countries and regions there are organizations that have procedures
to examine a software for critical applications and gives series of evaluations for
"security level" of the target . like Common Criteria , CC , and AEL levels in the
U.S or there are many MIL-STDs in NATO area..
is this what you are talking about ?

@_subject: [Cryptography] Cycles overhead for TLS 
there are modern cpu instructions helping with crypto , to name one :
AES set of instructions in new intel chips . there are cheap crypto
accelerator modules used where performance matters and fast optical
networks dont care about tcp weight since mature lower level protocols
handle things properly for todays environment ( sonet , sdh on wire
and wcdma on air , for example ) . i havent seen engineers in
carrier-class operators i met ever worry about crypto weight
..comparing to the other common "issues" with performance in those
environment .

@_subject: [Cryptography] Proof that the NSA does not have a quantum 
argumentatively even if NSA hasnt cracked bitcoin , it necessarily doesnt guarantee , and therefore a "proof" of not having Q capabilities . additionally here are basic counterarguments :
- if q machinery was to build and put to use , they are people who have the budget , talent resource , political and societal means to do it .
- the corrupt govt cases prove , if anything , the hunger and risk taking nature of the environment . advancements happen in those criteria . some nerd jokes about silk road or prostitution cases are far too lame to be offered as basis of measurement of usg's willingness for power . whether its NSA who builds a working q machine or a weird project within DOE routed to a remote Sandia site doesnt matter . its highly doubtful if expensive and very forward technologies , if exist , used in police cases imho
- there is simply no guarantee that pk based systems are immune to post modern math attacks , the kind that its actually NSA's job to go get them , and whoever is involved with them , classified .
- not a commerce expert but seems to me the Chinese have proven history to mess with currency and exchange systems and used it for political gain . i suppose other players most certainly usg may have done that as well . if bitcoin is to be taken seriously in trade i would be very doubtful of China and usg not messing with it already . average math/crypto/software folks with laser pencil and powerpoints can go all night how great is dh or others for that matter . i just dont buy it
- the actual financial gain to get physical with bitcoin and crack it would be silly .
- nsa internal security is bad . the media identity known as snowden is not supposedly the way to prove that . there were more serious leaks and defectors from within us ic including nsa in war time . there is google for the names and their impacts . the older cases are much better in this argument because its more likely the whole truth about them is revealed by different actors over the time specially the difficult post cold war era . from this point , argument goes based on whether we assume nsa learns from history or not and in both cases i dont see the proof of them not having the q , necessarily
quick point -- i am not actually saying they have it . but all things considered , if i hear credible source saying they got it , i wouldnt be surprised .
