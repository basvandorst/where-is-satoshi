@_subject: Verisign CRL single point of failure 
You are correct I did miss your point in haste. I cannot answer that, but I can tell you that disabling the function or
uninstalling NAV that has CRL function, fixes the problem immediately.
And if you watch your firewall as the clients open a file that requests a
virus scan they all try to hit crl.verisign.com. This has been happening
since the 7th when that cert expired.
