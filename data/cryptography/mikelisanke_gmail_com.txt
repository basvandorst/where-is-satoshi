Have a look at Karnough Maps, which is a matrix Boolean algebra
reduction technique. I understand that there are more advanced
computational algorithms at this point. But, I believe that they build
off of the principle of adjacency found in a Karnough Map matrix.

@_subject: Locating private keys in RAM? 
Many applications using RSA make use of a private key in its ASN.1 BER form.
In this format, the surrounding encoding of a private key becomes very
easily recognizable.
The follow is an excerpt from RFC3447 (PKCS

Perry, It's too bad we can't get one or two people on MSM echoing your
concern for security, over just the belief Apple is standing only on moral
high ground. Yes, Apple has explained generally there are security problems
with the FBI's request, but; nobody has explained in layman's terms Why the
FBI's demands make their request security absurd. Also, nobody has argue
that this problem (breaking strong encryption on known cipher-text) is an
FBI problem, not Apple's and certainly not Apple phone users' problem. IMO,
Apple should tell FBI to offload raw encrypted phone data and break it on
high powered machines. Perhaps, FBI is too ignorant to realize that
cracking a password on the target machine is actually more computationally
difficult than on an array of processors in a supercomputer network :-p...
I don't think that's the case... what they want is cracked iPhone software
which can be sprinkled into cyberspace and onto phones that agents can
field-crack (for example). Too bad, that's not the way FBI forensic
investigation is suppose to work, and not the way the law US Code is
written either.

@_subject: [Cryptography] how to encrypt for the very long term? 
We are taught the only provably secure cryptography is a random key as
large as your data which Xor produces perfect encryption. A book cipher is
a simplification
as a book is not random data. If you use a generator for your randomness,
it's not random. If you use a random data source, collect enough for your
entire data, and
have a secure place to place this random key, then, In Theory, your
cryptography will remain secure forever... or until you lose (or misplace)
the random key.

@_subject: [Cryptography] how to encrypt for the very long term? 
I have a slightly different view... encryption is also about making
exchange of secure data possible... often secure data is decrypted and
re-encrypted locally...
a secure location for a long term key is something that could be easily
destroyed... I wouldn't think people would encrypt their long pure key...
but they would
likely keep multiple keys+secure data offline in different locations in
case they need access to long term information after destroying their only
key. .

The 1st question I have about this proof of stake consensus is, can't I buy
enough nodes to eventually end up to be elected to run my own team?

@_subject: [Cryptography] How does bitcoin find if a transaction output 
Finally, my question exactly, the question nobody in cryptocurrency answers
(satisfactorily) ... how does verification work? it's too damn big
To be more complete... who the heck checks if the verifiers checked?
where's the procedure to assure it's correct? who verifies Contracts?
who verifies ACLs for blockchain DBs? I've asked a bunch of 'experts' who
seamed (very -  and I never use this) put off by the question.
If the Only thing you have is a chain of hashed transactions, and proof
Only that one version path a Proof of Work test But Not what verification
that 'node' did... then you don't have enough. Yes, everybody Might be
running the software common to a node And (assume it's open source)
I can check that it would do Something to verify Transaction double-spend
And smart-contract, etc/ But as other responses state, what if the
node that won the block mine Didn't do that work... we Wait until 'someone
else' finds the mistake? then what?
Any way, thanks for asking this question!
