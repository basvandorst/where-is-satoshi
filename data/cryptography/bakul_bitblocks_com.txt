According to
RPi's hardware random number generator uses a "thermal noise"
entropy source. I asked them but was told there are no further
public details. So unknown if it is more secure or less.
FWIW, it passes rngtest from debian rng-tools and does about
On linux/pi the h/w RNG is available under /dev/hwrng.
seems to be extremely slow (80 bits/second) or broken or has
the wrong default settings.
FreeBSD/pi /dev/random is much much faster @ 33Mibis/sec. AFAIK
it doesn't use the h/w RNG.

May be you can try something like the $5 RaspberryPi Zero +
plan9? The plan9 os 'image' also contains a small readonly
bootfs containing programs needed to bootstrap further.  You
can remove everything from this bootfs except a fileserver of
your choice + something to use an AES encrypted partition.
And you can remove all kernel devices you don't need.  You can
then feed the aes key via its GPIO pins or UART something.
The kernel is much simpler than BSD.
Or may be an AESlib + arduino will fit your bill better (but
not something I have played with). People have also interfaced
ESP8266 to SDcards + AES.
There are number of smaller devices but the specs are not
always available (having a running linux is not enough) or
they don't have a large enough community of users.

What is not clear to me is how you plan to access these files
or put them on the device. What is the ideal or must have API?
The fileserver program would run as a user mode program.  A Go
based program just might run unchanged acrosss Windows and
Unix based OSes (where Go runs). With 9p you should be able to
mount the FS and do normal file io. But not clear to me what
you really want.

"Snickerdoodle" by krtkl.com looks interesting:  Zynq 7010 or 7020, .5/1GB, Wi-fi,  etc. Also has some related boards (PiSmasher...). RTOS or Linux.
For FPGA dev you have to use Xilinx "Vivado". This should allow simulation as well.
Tom Skibo has ported FreeBSD to varius Zynq based boards such as Zedboard, Zybo, Parallela and Snickerdoodle:   Also of interest may be SpinalHDL, a high level HDL (the compiler maps it to VHDL or Verilog, after which you can use the usual closed source tools from Xilinx etc.!). SpinalHDL is actually a Scala library. You can't translate arbitrary Scala code to VHD/Verilog but a constrained subset. Supposedly takes away some of the drudgery of VHDL/Verilog. SpinalHDL is similar to Chisel from UCB.   There is example 32 bit wide RISC-V soft core and Crypto at
