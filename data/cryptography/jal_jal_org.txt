It has always been mostly a technical problem, and only partially a
social problem. I had to change my (admittedly simple) whitelisting recently, when
spammers started using the same domain name we do business under, or the
name of partners.
Yep. Spam rates have been creeping up on Debian lists, lately.
Another list I'm on having to do with Oracle has been having similar
problems. "Who is a meaningful member?"
That's a tough question, if you don't charge, and if you do, you miss
quite a bit, thus lowering the value. Commons, tragedy, etc.
