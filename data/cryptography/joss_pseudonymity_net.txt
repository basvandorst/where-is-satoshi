@_subject: once more, with feeling. 
I'm running Firefox 3.0.1 on (Gentoo) Linux and had coincidentally just
gone through this process.
When adding an exception for a site with an invalid security certificate
there is a checkbox at the bottom of the "Add Security Exception" window
that gives you the option to permanently store the exception. It is
checked by default, but the option not to do so is there (and works!)

@_subject: English 19-year-old jailed for refusal to disclose decryption 
Just to correct this: the sentence was 16 weeks, not 16 months.
The legislation in question is the Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act of 2000 (RIPA), part III of which has been in force in the UK since
2007. This allows for a maximum sentence of two years for refusing a
request that encrypted data be "put into an intelligible form".
