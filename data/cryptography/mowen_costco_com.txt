While taking a look at the proposed Texas law, it appears that it
only applies if you are trying to actually cause harm:
QUOTE: SECTION 2.  Sections 31.12(a), (b), and (e), Penal Code, are amended to read as follows:
or defraud a communication service
It doesn't look as bad as it was made out to be, but it all
depends on how they determine "intent".
[Moderator's note: is using a NAT box "intent to defraud" a cable
modem provider? --Perry]
