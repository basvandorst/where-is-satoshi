@_subject: [Cryptography] Elliptic curve question 
I made a simple elliptic curve utility in command line PHP:
I know in the RSA, the sign is inverse operation of encrypt, so two
different keypairs needs for encrypt and sign. In elliptic curve
cryptography, the sign is not the inverse operation of encrypt, so my
application use same keypair for encrypt and sign.
Is this correct?
Thank you!
