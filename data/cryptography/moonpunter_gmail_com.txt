very concerned about the high, and increasing, % of users who use SPV
clients rather than run full nodes. While it's hard to predict exactly
when this threshold is reached, at some point too few people will be
actually verifying the blockchain to sufficiently strongly incentivise
miners to follow the rules. For instance, at some point miners can great
bitcoins out of thin air to increase their profits. >
While I share your concern and generally encourage people to have a full
copy of the block chain unless there is a very, very good reason not to
(Armory over Electrum, desktop over mobile, etc.),  I am incredibly
curious as to how coins could be "created out of thin air." Whether or
not folks have full nodes, they can still review the block chain through
a given explorer. It seems perhaps your real fear is that ignorance
among new users of the protocol will eventually lead to malfeasance at
the hands of those more practiced in it.
But still, how could these coins be generated without there being some
actual provenance on the blockchain? Wouldn't the miners in fact then be
stealing coins, in a sense? On the one hand, by generating oversized
coinbase rewards somehow (please explain), that's theft from the future.
On the other, sending coins that don't belong to them, in effect,
invalidates some other coins.
Obviously miner centralization could create such a scenario. I've read
on the bitcoin-dev list recently that there's talk via BIP 99 (I think)
of having a way of changing the protocol such that ASIC farms would have
to essentially reboot.
But, seriously. Please tell us how miners could "create coins out of
thin air." I've never heard of such an idea until now.

John, I'm confused.

What, if any, efforts have been initiated to replace GPG? I'm very
interested to know. I understand that RSA 4096 is much more than "pretty
good," but I'm also sure that folks are forever working on such tools.

I'm interested in Namecoin-like decentralized implementations that could
potentially be easier to use and easier to learn. Not Namecoin
specifically, just using it as an example of a block chain that has been
used for purposes other than storing transaction records.
It's crushingly ironic to me when I visit SKS and get SSl errors there.
What else is there in this category that's worth looking into? Even
theoretical (papers) are worth noting to me at this point, as I'm mostly
talking on theoretical terms rather than practical (working) software
that is available now.
