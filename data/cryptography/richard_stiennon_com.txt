@_subject: Opinion on Israeli espionage plot 
While I completely agree that the TH case in Israel must represent the "tip of the iceberg" and for sure there will be similar cases in Europe and the US (have already been).  But it is pretty useless to blow this particular horn.    I am sure many Israeli firms are scanning their machines to look for the presence of Trojans, but apparently the impact in the US has been close to zero.    Not until security incidents actually occur do most companies respond.  So just wait....

@_subject: encrypted tapes 
I spent several years as such a security auditor for PwC.  While yes, they do hire a bunch of kids out of MBA school they also have extremely experienced senior managers supervising them.    We always delved into business processes as well as using "off the shelf" tools. Invariably I would find major flaws in the way security was implemented at utilities, railroads, major banks, and computer manufacturers.
At Gartner I always advised my clients that if the purpose of the audit was to find a bunch of stuff and fix it then you should select a local boutique firm  who will do a faster, more in-depth assessment and give you actionable items to address at a very reasonable cost. If your purpose in doing a security audit is to convince the board of directors that you need to invest more in security then go with a big audit firm because their opinion holds much more weight.

That's not a change. You should never have granted unlimited trust to insiders. Just as most organizations do not have the same person handling accounts payable and vendor selection, you should have checks and balances in IT as well.
