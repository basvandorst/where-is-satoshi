@_subject: jointly create a random value for corrupted party 
What does it mean "A uses this value in the form of g^r"?
A uses r not g^r, doesn't it?
This is a weak point: from A's use of r every party should be able to compute g^r mod p with no knowledge of r.
I assume you know how to organize that.
What's about the following modification?
Each party i\in{B,C,D} sends to A the value of r_i secretly.
Upon receiving all three values A broadcasts
q_1=g^{r_B} mod p, q_2=g^{r_C} mod p, q_3=g^{r_D} mod p.
The party i then verifies that the value r_i was used to produce one of q_1, q_2, q_3.
 From A's use of r every party computes g^r mod p and verifies that g^r=q1*q2*q3.
