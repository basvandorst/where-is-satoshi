juan it is common knowledge that the snowden so called fucking leaks are
given to the US gov before publication
always remember and never forget gg was fully behind the war in iraq and
why was he fully behind it ? revenge ... that tells you the mind that is
working on the so called leaks
also laura she was an embed journo in iraq - something an activist journo
wouldnt even think about doing lets not even fully talk about that she
blindly backs the assange wikileaks 'merger' into one entity
and jeremy scahill did a selfie (among other ethical violations against
woman) in samalia with a dead body in a morgue for his little movie, again
something journalists dont do - even pond scum journalists dont get their
picture took with dead bodies for camera - these are the ethical parameters
of the people working with the info

in 2001 - when i think the whitepaper was presented in 2008 - he says he
was working on developing something else at that time
i think you are right - i know from dealing with ppl who have signed
agreements re classified info that they can be kinda obsessed with that -
he may have been referencing that instead
journalist can be totally fraudulent for sure but others in the article
seemed to blab a lot - people are strange theres like a switch that gets
turned on when they talk to interviewers a ?stupid switch?

Is Silent Circle âUS Govt Approvedâ?
Encrypted Blackphone goes to war with snoopers
Sunday Jan 19, 2014  |  Rob Lever for Agence France Presse
"The larger firms, said Janke, 'want to own your soul. These companies are
in the business of monetizing data'."
âWe know that encryption works,â he said, adding that âbrute forceâ attacks
to break encryption are rare because they are time-consuming, and that spy
agencies generally use other means like inserting viruses in emails or
hardware that can intercept messages.
Because of this, Janke is careful not to promise too much. He said
Blackphone is not a âhardenedâ device like some designed for military use.
âThere is no such thing as a completely secure phone,â he said. âNothing is
going to protect you from your own behavior. But out of the box, this phone
does a lot of things to protect your privacy.â
