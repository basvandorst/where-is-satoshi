Well, they are some tests to judge the "quality" of a random number
generator. The best known being the Diehard tests:
For sure, these tests might be an overkill here. Also, there must be
some tests in the Art of Computer Programming too but I don't have it
at hand right now (shame on me).
I don't see the point of evaluating the quality of a random number
generator by statistical tests. But I might be wrong, though.

I fear I was not clear: I don't see what is wrong in evaluating the
quality of a random number generator with (an extensive set of)
statistical tests.
For sure, it would be better if we could check the source code and
match the implemented RNG against an already known RNG.
But, then, there is a "the chicken or the egg" problem: how would you
ensure that a *new* RNG is a good source of "randomness" ? (it's not a
rhetorical questions, I'm curious about other approaches).

Just by curiosity, I ran the Diehard tests on /dev/random (FreeBSD
7.0) and a sha1 sequence of [ 1 ... N ]. Both random files are 63 Mb.
I know that there has been some controversy about /dev/random of
FreeBSD on this list in the past, I don't know if the "issues" has
been solved, though. I do not have any other OS at hand right now.
To interpret the results, quoting DieHard presentation:
        Most of the tests in DIEHARD return a p-value, which

So, I would say that Sha1(n) does not pass DieHard (while /dev/random
does). But this would require further examination, in particular to
understand why some tests failed. And, in fact, I have no clue why
they failed...
