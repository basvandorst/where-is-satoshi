"But there was an utterly trivial fix that DES users could employ if
they were worried
about security: they could simply encrypt each message twice, turning
56-bit DES into 112-bit DES, and squaring the number of key sequences
a code breaker would have to try. Messages could even be encrypted
and, indeed, many financial institutions at the time were already using
"Triple DES." "
Not quite true. Encrypting each message twice would not increase the
"effective" key size to 112 bits.
There is an attack named "meet in the middle" which will make the
effective key size to be just 63 bits. This is why twice was not used
and they are using Triple DES, which has an effective key size of 112

2^57 operations, with 2^56 blocks of storage manipulation can be
approximated to: 2^56 * log(2^56) + 2^56 * log(2^56) = 2^62 + 2^62 =
Betting on storage as a show stopper is not a good idea, regardless of
sleep pattern.

So let say that I don't have 2^56 blocks of centralized storage, but I
have 2^40. Now by independently guessing 16 bits of each Key1 and Key2,
I will need only 2^(56-16) = 2^40 blocks of centralized storage . But
the attack must be run now over 2^16 * 2^16 pairs of such tables to
allow all possible key pairs. So the time is on order of 2^(2*16) *
2^(56-16) = 2^72.
That means that I can make an time-memory tradeoff, such that it will
accommodate my resources.
