Just out of curiosity, does anyone happen to know of any documented
examples of a botnet being used for something more interesting than
just sending spam or DDoS?

The NSA at Home project( seems to do it pretty well.
He even provides the optimized SHA-1 and MD5 Verilog code used.  This only works
because straight-up bruteforce requires little memory, though. If the new
SHA-1 break requires significant memory usage I don't think something
like the COPACOBANA can help.

@_subject: Wikileaks video "crypto". 
This site  claims to have the original,
unencrypted video. It appears to have been encrypted with OpenSSL given the
Salted__ prefix.
