special services, but rather an "intellectual product" of the group
itself, product of its operative, informational and analytical
abilities. But compiling the updates we used materials available from

"operativnaya informatsiya" never claimed to be "military information
updates" but served as additional data for self-dependent analysis.
Translation: "We made it all up".
