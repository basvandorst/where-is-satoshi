Indeed.  And the suggestion that a  be added to the standard to help prop up compilers that don't support the standard is a little... circular.

Out of curiosity, how does the performance of AES compare to Blowfish (seeing as how performance would be the obvious advantage of Blowfish over 3DES)?  Also are there any patent/license constraints on AES (the main reason I think Blowfish has become so common is it's "public domain" status)?
