Oh come on.  This is really just a sophisticated variant of the old  "never say
which was wrong" - login ID or password - attack.  In this case it's  padding or
MACing.  If either fails the result should be the same: something went  sorry for you.  The POET Oracle depends upon the server taking a  shortcut and
signaling which went wrong first.
Perfect games of Draughts always end in draws.

I said it was old :)  but it's still as true now as a use-case as it  was way back then, in its time.

Make it like an electrical fuse?
For heaven?s sake, why not just a sensor next to and in line with the physical on/off switch like a hyper sensitive geiger counter, and widely available sources of benign radioactives, linked to a machine register?
The machine couldn?t even turn itself on until it was random enough.  Would that be an acceptably low-level and early enough blocking State for sufficiently random seeds for all practical purposes?

I'm also leery of using literally the same key in both directions.  Maybe a simple transform would suffice; maybe not.
If the same key is used, there needs to be a simple way of ensuring the sequence numbers can never overlap each other.

In retrospect it seems that certain aspects of the then au currant NIST
statistical randomness tests were badly flawed at the time that AES candidates
were being evaluated.  Don?t know that it would have made much difference,
just noting that they were badly skewed.  How could this have happened?

Take, as an example, a one time hotline, a digital one time pad, constantly occupying a certain channel with indistinguishable noise. And every once in a while a signal gets added to the noise.

No, no, no, no. The 1st Polish crack into early Enigma was due to
operator and procedural error, pretty much. But I think what you?re
thinking of is the crack of FISH, which was an offset by one of a
retransmission of a baudot stream. Could be wrong: I often am.

Codes can have variable length plaintext symbols, and also variable length ciphertext symbols.
Ciphers have same length plaintext symbols, but can have variable length ciphertext symbols.
It?s akin to the difference between ?but? & ?and? :)

Encrypt everything we do, as quickly as possible.
The fundamental questions, even with PubKey, remain:
(1) Where do keys come from & how are they exchanged?
(2) Even after that, how can they be used & abused?

What is the mechanism for separating the wheat from the chaff?
If we have a continually full channel full of fulsome noise, how does the receiver
distinguish valid traffic from nothing? Are there false positive & false negative
rates at play here? Presumably both would have to be dialled down to be pretty low.
Which as we all know is pretty much impossible.

But as the prima sans ultra is indistinguishability from random,
how can the receiver ever hope to distinguish signal from noise
while simultaneously having a security guarantee?

Maybe things have changed. I?ve always thought in principle
it is impossible to achieve insignificant (for some epsilon
of significance) levels of false positives & false negatives
at the same time with the same level of insignificance. No?
