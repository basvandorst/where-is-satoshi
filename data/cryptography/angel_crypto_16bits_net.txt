@_subject: [Cryptography] best practices considered bad term 
We can perform a quick and not extremely accurate comparison looking at:
On 2014, 376 vulnerabilities were found in Microsoft products, compared
to 286 in Apple ones.
So not so distant as you seem to expect -and in fact in 2012 an 80% more
of vulnerabilities were found in Apple products than in Microsoft ones-
At early 2000s the comparison was brutal, though.
(Not necessarily meaning Apple did things better, perhaps they were less
recorded, there was certainly less attention given to Apple
vulnerabilities, and they had drifted much less from BSD, which has an
excellent security record.)
Funnily, on 2015 Apple already has 48 vulnerabilities, while Microsoft
only 10. Too early to predict anything, though.
I'd say that the perception was ?Microsoft is insecure?, rather than
?Apple is secure?
The price is a marketing decision, with little relationship to the
product security (actually, developing a product you will support in an
insecure way is more expensive in the long run).
By the way, it was John Sculley who went to made Macintosh expensive,
back in 1984, in opposition to Steve Jobs, who wanted a more affordable
Did Apple beat Microsoft on software security? I wouldn't affirm that much.
It certainly has a big advantage in being a much more closed ecosystem, and
thus it's much simpler for them to produce secure solutions. However, Apple
seems to deal with  similar issues to Microsoft in this field, with an
increasing number of security problems reported. And they too have prioritised features or ui over security at times.
In the end, "solid internal design and care" is not something observable or
easily noticeable by the end user. Unlike other properties, like performance,
price (concrete) or appearance (abstract), security is an intangible.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Proposal of a fair contract signing protocol 
As soon as there is a (trusted, maybe distributed) third party, you can
get away of this issue:
* Bob could send the signature of the contract to trusted third party,
which would both ensure it reaches Alice and record when was it
* The rules for storing into the blockchain would presumably allow to
locate any given contract that was potentially stored there.
* Another option would be for the government to force companies into
publishing daily the [hashes of] contracts they have agreed into. If
Alice fetches Bob's list of contracts, and her contract is there, she
nows (at most with a delay of 1 day) that Bob accepted the contract. If
the list was signed today and the contract is not there (supposing the
contract stated that today was the deadline for the offer), that counts
as a refusal (keep the signed list of agreed-upon contracts as proof).
If the published list is an old one, she can contact the regulator and
complain that Bob is at fault (yet, Bob could serve an updated version
to the regulator, but an old one to people with pending contracts,
requiring Alice to eg. use proxies in order to get the updated info).

Take a service that simply used CBC with an out-of-band preshared key. A

When, several hours later, another client joins to the same stream, it

Now, let's suppose that rather than rather than using the prior

concatenation of the nonce and all prior ciphertext.¹ In that case, it
is not suitable for the client to process all prior data in order to

I am a bit worried by the truncation part. The fact that a hash function
is collision-resistant does NOT mean that the first N-bits (in your case
25) are as collision resistant as the whole hash.
Thus, you may find for instance that a SHA2 truncated to 128 bits is
actually suffering more collisions than a "weaker" MD5.
If that human misuse is a concern, I think you would have to move to
either use a wordlist (either PGP Word List or a new one). Or perhaps by
completely making it non-readable (like removing vowels) you might get
some people making a better check than readable words that would attract
to be the ones checked, (however, it increases the odds of people not
making any verification at all).
I guess there's also the argument of people actually lowering the
entropy by focusing on generating readable hashes (on the other handit
would be easier to remember a hash of "MONEY-LENDI-NGSER-VICES-BANK").
Even if placing a (human) filter after random key generation for
discarding "ugly hashes" decreases the initial entropy, I am however not
aware of any way that could be actually exploited, provided:
* It uses a strong hash function (pre-image resistance)
* The keys themselves are not weakened for facilitation getting a
readable hash (eg. using composite numbers in place of a prime)
* The generation method does not follow a set of steps that actually
allow cheaper generation of the key.

I don't think you *really* need OTR encryption for a video meeting
program. It makes sense on a messaging platform where the same "thread"
continues for months, so you want to rotate the keys frequently enough?
so that a stolen key doesn't allow to decrypt past ciphertexts? nor
intercept future communications. So far, so good. But here our usecase
is a virtual meeting. The average length of these would maybe be around
an hour. Just generate a new symmetric key when the session starts and
discard it at the end. You have deniability in that the other side could
have created the same stream. Yes, an attacker that got hold of the key
could decrypt a network stream that it had separately recorded. Or probe
that the video evidence matches the notarized encrypted network content.
However, on a video stream you would be easily identified by voice /
image, and analyzed checking its continuity, not using those roundabout
ways. In order to decrypt the traffic, Eve would need to extract the key
from an identity joined in the meeting, which could as well be recording
it locally and then forwarding to her. Thus, if you are dealing with
well-behaved software your OTR could simply be a signal in the stream
that kindly asks not to allow local recording.?
Sure, an encryption key is easier to leak unnoticed than a full video
stream, and there would occasionally be some uncommon meetings, such as
one that is hosted by a streaming security camera. It is good to have
the ability to rekey, but you don't need to do so constantly.
I expect that in addition to the udp video stream, the system would also
use a separate reliable stream for things like metadata, text chat,
people join/part, raise hand, etc. where rekeying info could be easily
included. But in fact, the only use case I can think that actually would
need it would be when someone leaves a meeting that will turn into
things that they shall not know about (e.g. a job interview where after
the candidate leaves the interviewers continue on the same chat room,
discussing if they would like to hire him or not).

even the use of a weak PRNG for creating the wallet.
Breaking the storage wallet of a big fish such as an Exchange, where

Hello Kevin
I agree with you in that these descriptions should be improved.
You *could* make a dictionary attack if there was no IV, or only a fixed
one, much like you could create one for a hash function with no salt.
However, I don't think that would be the main problem.
The complete opposite of a random IV would be a fixed IV. It is clear
that such scheme would not achieve the probably expected security, as
files with common prefixes would result in encrypted files with common
encrypted prefixes.
If the IV varies, but it is predictable (e.g. a counter), an attacker
with access to an encryption oracle could send requests crafted so that
they undo the IV variation.
There is probably some cryptanalysis made possible by having a weak IV,
although -assuming a strong block cipher- I don't see how that may work.
Which isn't reassuring, given my lack of knowledge on the field :)
The most advanced attack I can think of right now, involving predictable
IVs would be a system that backed up the files of multiple users,
encrypting them separately with the same key but different, predictable,
IV. One of those users which viewed the encrypted output could abuse it
to discover/confirm that a file owned by a different user matches a
candidate plaintext file.

It seems that, by definition, someone with access to the locator key
will be able to obtain the files.
It may actually be desirable (so that it can be mirrored by other

There may be privacy concerns, such as a three-letter-agency tracking
which people download which files, correlating groups of people
downloading the same file, and storing an encrypted copy for the time

This doesn't mean it is stored *on a disk* It might all be on ram.
