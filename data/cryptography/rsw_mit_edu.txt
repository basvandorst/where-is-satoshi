@_subject: crypto flaw in secure mail standards 
In this spirit, I have produced a patch for Mutt that adds an option
to include the To:, From:, CC:, and Subject: headers at the end of PGP
signed messages.
This patch happens to interact somewhat with a previous patch I
produced that allows Mutt to optionally send PGP messages as
content-type text/plain for broken mail clients like nmh and Eudora,
so I have integrated both into a single patch.  It applies against mutt-1.2.5i; I haven't tested it against others,
but I suspect it should work fine.
