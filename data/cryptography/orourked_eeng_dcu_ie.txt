@_subject: Montgomery Multiplication 
I was just wondering if anyone knew where to get a good explanation of
Montgomery multiplication
for the non-mathematician?  I have a fair bit of maths but not what is
needed to understand his paper.
Thanks for your help,

@_subject: Euler's Phi Function 
I have seen two slightly different definitions for the Euler's phi function.
They don't cause any difference in its value
but I was just wondering if there would be anyone who would complain about
the use of one or the other?
One says that for a positive integer n, phi(n) is the number of positive
integers less than n and relatively prime to it.
The other differs slightly by saying that it's the number of positive
integers less than or equal to n and relatively prime
to it.  Because n is not relatively prime to itself this doesn't make a
difference in its value and using "less than or equals" seems slightly
superfluous, however, I am writing a report and I just want to be very
precise about the whole thing.  Thanks for your help.

@_subject: Fw: Euler's Phi Function 
I'm just after thinking about 1.  1 is relatively prime to itself but it
would be the only positive integer.
However if we take the first definition as correct then phi(1) might be
considered meaningless as
there are no positive integers less than 0.  I suppose however, that this
could mean that
phi is equal to 0 in this case but it doesn't it equals 1.  This is
rectified in the second definition
because it is less than or equal to itself and also relatively prime to
itself which gives a value of 1
for phi(1) as expected.
Any thoughts would be great.

@_subject: Differential Power Analysis Question 
Hello All,
I thought somebody might be able to answer a little mathematical
discrepancy on DPA that I can't figure out.  It's probably
something I am over looking but I can't seem to see what.  I
realise that this topic was closed a good while ago but I tried
to send this question at the time only to find out that I couldn't
send an attachment.  I needed to send a pdf file as I couldn't
produce the mathematical symbols in ASCII.  I have managed to
obtain some web space however and I have put the pdf file there
and am sending you all the link instead.  I would be most
appreciative if you would take a look at it for me - its very short.
The address is:
I hope somebody can tell me what I am doing wrong here and I thank
you all for your time.
Best Regards,

@_subject: Cryptoprocessors compliant with FIPS 140-2 
I was wondering if anyone could list a number of cryptographic processors
that are compliant with the Federal information processing standard (FIPS)
140-2 "Security Requirements for cryptographic modules".  I know that the
IBM-4758 was compliant with FIPS 140-1 up to level 4 but I don't think
it has been tested under the newer version of the standard (correct me if
wrong).  Specifically I am wondering about section 4.11 on page 39 entitled
"Mitigation of Other Attacks" which discusses, power analysis, timing
TEMPEST and fault induction.
If you could tell me what level they have been certified to and where I
find some more information on them that would be great.  In fact, any
information would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for your time.
Best Regards,

@_subject: Hacking tool sees the light  
By Robert Lemos
      CNET       BERKELEY, Calif. - A Princeton University student has shed light on security flaws in Java and .Net virtual machines by using a lamp, some known properties of computer memory and a little luck.
      An attack requires physical access to the computer, so the technique poses little threat to virtual machines running on PCs and servers. But it could be used to steal data from smart cards, asserts Sudhakar Govindavajhala, a computer-science graduate student at Princeton who demonstrated the procedure here Tuesday.
      "There are smart cards that use Java that you could shine a light on, flip a bit and get access to the card's data," he said.
      Mr. Govindavajhala presented the paper at the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) Symposium on Security and Privacy.
      The technique relies on the ability of energy to "flip bits" in memory. While cosmic rays very occasionally can cause a random bit in memory to change value, from zero to one or from one to zero, Mr. Govindavajhala decided not to wait. He used a lamp to heat up the chips inside a computer and cause one or more bits of memory to change.
      By doing so, the researcher broke the security model virtual machines rely on: That the computer faithfully executes its instruction set.
      "You have broken out of the sandbox," Mr. Govindavajhala said.
      Virtual machines are software programs that emulate a virtual computer entirely within the host computer's memory. The programs are used to allow software to run on multiple platforms. For example, Java applets can execute on a virtual machine running on the Windows, Linux or Mac operating system. Another feature of such virtual machines is that they keep applets contained to a software "sandbox" - preventing them from affecting the data on the computer.
      Mr. Govindavajhala attacked the system by adding his own code into memory and then filling the remaining free memory with the address of the new code. He found that if he could fill 60 per cent of memory with the addresses, a random bit flip would instead cause his attack code to run more than 70 per cent of the time. In the remaining instances, a key program on the computer would crash.
      Fred Cohen, a principal analyst with technology consultancy The Burton Group, said people who created virtual machines didn't take into account this possible attack method.
      "Here is a case where people thought they had thought of everything, but they hadn't," he said.
      Mr. Cohen added that even if distrusted applications are contained to a sandbox, they can still be dangerous. "If you let people run programs in your computer," he said, "then there is a chance they can do what they want."
      Mr. Govindavajhala's technique could be useful in stealing data from smart cards, which look like credit cards but have memory and a simple processor implanted in the card. Since getting a hold of someone's smart card is much easier than cracking the case on a PC, the attack would be feasible.
      "Certainly there are some smart cards that this could work on," Mr. Cohen said. "There are all sorts of handheld devices where such an attack has potential to do harm as well."
      In addition to such devices, the attack could have some implications for so-called trusted computing systems, such as Microsoft's next-generation secure computing base, formerly known as Palladium. Mr. Govindavajhala hadn't studied the effects of his error-inducing techniques on such a system, however.
      Yet, the student researcher did point out that as processors and memory get faster, the energy needed to induce bit flips becomes smaller, suggesting that his technique will only become more effective as time goes on.

@_subject: Privacy Concerns for UWB technology? 
I was at a talk last night on Ultra Wideband (UWB) technology which is
sometimes referred to as "Bluetooth on Steroids".
An example of what a UWB home might look like was given and it mainly
consisted of everything that a normal
home has today except without the wires.  So you have your plasma TV
connected to your DVD player using
UWB and you can hook up a camcorder to it as well etc.
UWB offers rates of about 100Mb/s which is comparable with the 802.11n
standard.  I asked the speaker what
was the general thoughts on privacy concerns with this technology and he
basically said there wasn't any concerns
but I don't think it was something he had thought about before.  UWB works
over a very large bandwidth (the  FCC
allocated something like 7GHz of the spectrum for it) however it uses very
low power.  Its range is very limited (about
10m or so).  I don't know much about the technology itself but he mentioned
that is was something like spread
spectrum so I assume it uses some kind of pseudorandom code to allow
successful requisition of signals.
I am curious about the privacy issue however.  The speaker said that
encryption would be used and that that would
protect a persons privacy but at these high data rates would encryption not
hinder the overall process?  I assume
a stream cipher like RC4 would be used as in WiFi?  I realise that the range
in this case is very small and that privacy
is not as big a problem as other wireless technologies however this doesn't
stop your next door neighbour watching the
home made video of you and your family on holidays.
Any thoughts?

@_subject: Looking for Source of AES code 
I have some AES code here in C and I am trying to find it's author and
source.  I can't find
it on the Internet so I figure it was taken from a book.  Now I don't want
to send the entire
code to the list for obvious reasons however I was hoping you could help me
from the following
small snippet.  Maybe the use of " _fastcall " might jog someone's memory.
If there is
code that appears similar to this but is not exactly the same I would
appreciate the source
of that also.
void _fastcall encrypt(FILE *Encryption_File, FILE *Encrypted_File, unsigned
uchar in[16], out[16];
unsigned state[NumberOfBytes], rnd, i;
while (!feof(Encryption_File))
  uchar k=0;
   fread(in,sizeof(uchar),16,Encryption_File);/
   *(state+0)= *(in+0)<<24 | *(in+1)<< 16  | *(in+2)<<8  | *(in+3);
   *(state+1)= *(in+4)<<24 | *(in+5)<< 16  | *(in+6)<<8  | *(in+7)  ;
   *(state+2)= *(in+8)<<24 | *(in+9)<< 16  | *(in+10)<<8 | *(in+11)  ;
   *(state+3)= *(in+1)<<24 | *(in+3)<< 16  | *(in+14)<<8 | *(in+15)  ;
   AddRoundKey (state, expkey);
 for( rnd = 1; rnd < NumberOfRounds + 1; rnd++ )

  ByteSub((uchar *)state);
  ShiftRows ((uchar *)state);
  if( rnd < NumberOfRounds )
        MixColumns ((uchar *)state);
  AddRoundKey (state, expkey + rnd * NumberOfBytes);
 }
Many Thanks,
