@_subject: [Cryptography] CFB/OFB/CTR mode with HMAC for key stream 
Hello List,
I was wondering if using HMAC with something like SHA-256 to create a key
stream in CFB/OFB/CTR mode is a bad idea.
Considering that in CFB/OFB/CTR modes, the cipher required in the mode is
used only to perform encryption operation for both encryption and
decryption, a HMAC can be used to generate a key stream.
So, the overall CFB/OFB/CTR mode remains exactly same with exception of
using HMAC in place for a cipher. The key being used as HMAC key while IV
can be as the HMAC message.
I am not a cryptographer but, have some experience with implementing
cryptography. I could not come up with reasons as to why this could be a
bad idea.

Hi Govind,
Your paper is not clearly describing the Device ID technology that you
authentication and its not really used to encrypt the actual data. This is
considering the fact the Device ID is getting added to the digital
certificate and can be read by anyone since its in plain text.
You seem to make assumption that an adversary who has access to quantum
computing will use only the official software application (e.g. text editor
with embedded support for Device ID) and that the software will deny access
to data even with correct private key that has been cracked.
Have you considered that the adversary will use its own code to crack the
keys and also to decrypt the data and totally ignore the Device ID?

Hi Govind,
On Fri, Jun 8, 2018 at 10:08 PM, Govind Yadav Like Natanael said earlier, the attacker can write code which works exactly
the same way the hardware would work. Hiding the algorithm in hardware
would be security by obscurity and it would be reversed eventually.
Take a look at TPM which is already available technology that can give you
a hash based on the hardware on the system. Any change in hardware will
generate a different hash value. This technology is used with whole drive
encryption like Bitlocker where the system decrypts itself without user
entering a key. Any modification in the hardware and the disk wont decrypt
without providing a backup recovery key. That means you cannot just remove
the hard drive and walk away from that system.
Any algorithm you develop will be available with the attacker too. Special
algorithm is not how its done. Key management is what is tough thing to
achieve and you need to focus on that part most.
You are still not even near to a solution. But don't lose your motivation
and keep thinking!
