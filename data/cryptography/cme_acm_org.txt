@_subject: CFP: PKI research workshop 
Included below is the ASCII CFP for our upcoming PKI research
workshop.  We're especially soliciting papers on ways to use public
key authentication/authorization that solve real problems, rather
than merely follow the traditional marketing patter about PKI.
1st Annual PKI Research Workshop
April 24-25, 2002. NIST, Gaithersburg MD, USA.
Sponsors include NIST, NIH, and Internet2.
To a large extent, the hoped-for public key infrastructure (PKI) has
not "happened yet."  PKI for large, eclectic populations has not
materialized; PKI for smaller, less diverse "enterprise" populations
is beginning to emerge, but at a slower rate than many would like or
had expected.  Why is this?
This workshop among leading security researchers will explore the
issues relevant to this question, and will seek to foster a long-term
research agenda for authentication and authorization in large
populations via public key cryptography.  The workshop is intended to
promote a vigorous and structured discussion---a discussion
well-informed by the problems and issues in deployment today.
We solicit papers, panel proposals, and participation.
    * Papers and Proposals Due: January 28, 2002
    * Authors Notified: March 5, 2002
    * Final Materials Due: April 1, 2002     * Workshop: April 24-25, 2002.
Submitted works for panels and papers should address one or more
critical areas of inquiry.  Topics include (but not are not limited
    * Cryptographic methods in support of security decisions
    * The characterization and encoding of security decision data
    name spaces, x509, SDSI/SPKI, XKMS, PGP, SAML, KeyNote,
    policy mappings and languages, etc.
    * The relative security of alternative methods for supporting
    decisions;
    * Privacy protection and implications of different approaches;
    * Scalability of security systems; (are there limits to growth?)     * Security of the rest of the components of a system;
    * User interface issues with naming, multiple private keys,
    disclosure
    * Mobility solutions
    * Approaches to attributes and delegation
    * Discussion of how the "public key infrastructure" required may
    differ from the ``PKI'' traditionally defined
Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF.  The final version
of refereed papers should ideally be between 8 and 15 pages, and in
case more than 20 pages.  Proposals for panels should be no longer
than five pages in length, and should include possible panelists, and
an indication of which of those panelists have confirmed
Full instructions will appear on our Web site by December 15, 2001.

was completely ineffective in stopping those hijackers who carried
them.  Such a card itself has almost no value.  If law enforcement
wants value from it, it would come from the underlying database that
the police would have to check to "learn
on any number of identifying items -- perhaps even biometrics (e.g.,
face recognition, based on a digital photo the cop takes -- or even
an iris scan taken by the same camera).  You don't have to have a
common number for indexing it.  That's 1950's IBM machine thinking.
also think that the opposition does, too.  Issuing national ID cards
would be expensive and would meet much resistance from the US
population.  Installing "ID-card-scanners" would be even more
expensive, perhaps enough to stop that step from happening.  (Seen
any Mondex card scanners lately?) Building the underlying database
mechanism would be far more expensive and would meet far more
resistance, but it's not until you do the second that you have any LE
value or any privacy threat at all.  If all you do is ask for the ID
card and don't check it, you encourage stupid uses (and therefore
identity theft).
forgers can concentrate all their efforts on that one mechanism and
get really good at such forgery.

Hash: SHA1
The Intel generator is not built into the Pentium but rather into the
Intel chipset (specifically, a part called the Firmware Hub).  It is
available in the 800-series chipsets/motherboards.  Roughly, you can
find these on Intel Pentium III and P-4 motherboards.  To find
whether a particular system has the RNG, you can try loading the
Intel RNG driver (under Windows) and you'll be told whether the
system has the hardware.
See  for the
driver ("Security Driver")
BTW, that RNG is really hot -- very high speed, very high entropy. The post-processing in hardware is relatively simple.  The driver
post-processes by running batches through a hash.
I'm told that the LINUX 2.4 kernel comes with the RNG driver
built-in, but I haven't tried that.

BTW, I have a program (which I will post when I get my act together)
showing a mapping from canonical S-expressions to XML (with the
reverse mapping obvious), and that defines another XML syntax for
SPKI certificates.  Paajarvi didn't use it because it requires a
schema (not DTD) to describe the resulting XML (because some element

@_subject: Overcoming the potential downside of TCPA 
The only thing to stop that is the certificate on the TCPA's built-in
key.  You would have to shave one TCPA chip and use its key in the
virtualized version.  If you distributed that shaved key publicly or
just to too many people, then its compromise would likely be detected
and its power to attest to S/W configuration would be revoked.
However, if you kept the key yourself and used it only at the same
frequency you normally would (for the normal set of actions), then
the compromise could not be detected and you should be able to run
virtualized very happily.
That's one of the main problems with TCPA, IMHO, as a security
mechanism: that its security depends on hardware tamper resistance --
but at the same time, the TPM needs to be a cheap part, so it can't
be very tamper resistant.

found out that nearly the entire stock of such parts was shipped to
IBM for their platforms.
So I called IBM and told the salesman on the phone I wanted to buy a
machine with one of those parts.  They were doing web/phone sales
only, so I couldn't go to the store and open the case and look at the
motherboard.  The salesman told me that he had no way to know what
parts were on the machine shipped to me.  That part was not
associated with any feature that showed up on his price sheet.
So, I asked what I should do to buy such a machine.
He answered that IBM had a generous return policy.

@_subject: Difference between TCPA-Hardware and a smart card (was: example: secure computing kernel needed) 
- Carl
+---Officer, arrest that man. He's whistling a copyrighted song.---+ It is an advantage for a TCPA-equipped platform, IMHO.  Smart cards cost
money. Therefore, I am likely to have at most 1.  TCPA acts like my hardware
crypto module and in that one hardware module, I am able to create and
maintain as many private keys as I want.  (The keys are wrapped by the TPM
but stored on the disk - even backed up - so there's no storage limit.)
Granted, you have to make sure that the S/W that switches among (selects)
private keys for particular uses does so in a way you can trust.  The
smartcard has the advantage of being a physical object. However, if you
can't trust your system S/W, then how do you know that the system S/W was
using a private key on the smart card you so happily plugged in rather than
one of its own (the same one all the time)?
TCPA includes two different things: wrapping or "sealing" of secrets -
something in service to you (and the thing I invoked in the previous
disagreement) - and remote attestation.  You do not need to do remote
attestation to take advantage of the TPM.  If it were my machine, I would
never do remote attestation.  With that one choice, I get to reap the
personal advantages of the TPM while disabling its behaviors that you find
objectionable (serving the outside master).
Of course, you're throwing out a significant baby with that bath water.
What if it's your secrets you want protected on my machine?  It doesn't have
to be the RIAA's secrets.  Do you object just as much when it's your
I haven't read that paper - will have to.  Thanks for the reference.
However, when I do read it, what I will look for is the non-network channel
between the observer and the PC.  Somehow, the observer needs to know that
the PC has not been tampered with and needs to know, securely (through
physical security) the state of that PC and its S/W.  How does the observer
do that?
If you tell me how the observer does that, then that observer is even better
used telling me the PC owner the state of my PC.  Forget about the outside
world.  They can take my word for it, if I have this wonderful oracle
telling me the truth about my PC.
Where can I get one of those observers?  I want one now.

@_subject: Difference between TCPA-Hardware and a smart card (was: example: secure computing kernel needed) 
We see here a difference between your and my sides of the Atlantic.  Here in
the US, almost no one has a smart card.
Of those cards you carry, how many are capable of doing public key
operations?  A simple memory smartcard doesn't count for what we were
talking about.
There are other problems with doing TCPA-like operations with a smartcard,
but I didn't go into those.  The biggest one to chew on is that I, the
computer owner, need verification that my software is in good shape.  My
agent in my computer (presumably the smartcard) needs a way to examine the
software state of my computer without relying on any of the software in my
computer (which might have been corrupted, if the computer's S/W has been
corrupted).  This implies to me that my agent chip needs a H/W path for
examining all the S/W of my computer.  That's something the TPM gives us
that a smartcard doesn't (when that smartcard goes through a normal device
driver to access its machine).

- Carl
+---Officer, arrest that man. He's whistling a copyrighted song.---+ This has nothing to do with the TCPA / TPM hardware. This is a political
argument about the unclean origins of TCPA (as an attempt to woo Hollywood).
I, meanwhile, never did buy the remote attestation argument for high price
content.  It doesn't work.  So, I looked at this as an engineer.  "OK, I've
got this hardware. If remote attestation is worthless, then I can and should
block that (e.g., with a personal firewall).  Now, if I do that, do I have
anything of value left?"  My answer was that I did - as long as I could
attest about the state of the software to myself, the machine owner.
This required putting the origins of the project out of my head while I
thought about the engineering.  That took effort, but paid off (to me).
What we need is some agent of mine - a chip - that:
1) has access to the machine guts, so it can verify S/W state
2) has a cryptographic channel to me, so it can report that result to me
3) has its own S/W in a place where no attacker could get to it, even if
that attacker had complete control over the OS.
The TCPA/TPM can be used that way.  Meanwhile, the TPM has no channel to the
outside world, so it is not capable of doing remote attestation by itself.
You need to volunteer to allow such communications to go through. If you
don't like them, then block them.  Problem solved.  This reminds me of the

That's an interesting definition, but you're describing a constraint on the
behavior of a human being.  This has nothing to do with cryptosystem choice
or network protocol design.  What mechanisms do you suggest for enforcing
even the constraint you cite?  Of course, that constraint isn't enough.  In
order to achieve non-repudiation, the way it is defined, you need to prove
to a third party (the judge) that a particular human being knowingly caused
a digital signature to be made.  A signature can be made without the
conscious action of the person to whom that key has been assigned in a
number of ways, none of which includes negligence by that person.
Let's just leave the term "non-repudiation" to be used by people who don't
understand security, but rather mouth things they've read in books that
others claim are authoritative.  There are lots of those books listing
"non-repudiation" as a feature of public key cryptography, for example, and
many listing it as an essential security characteristic.  All of that is
wrong, of course, but it's a test for the reader to see through it.

other companies do that too (and there might be others that do already -
since I don't follow this closely) then gradually the installed base of
TPM-equipped machines will grow.  It might take 10 years - or even more -
before every machine out there has a TPM.  However, that day may well come.

capable of forming that signature does not need to be used to verify it.
This is the original technical meaning of the term we're struggling over.
However, in Diffie and Hellman's original paper, (which referred to this as
"undeniable", if I remember correctly), the confusion had already set in.  A

presented in court to show that a particular human being made a particular

@_subject: Non-repudiation (was RE: The PAIN mnemonic) 
This one has no place in either technology or law because we do not know how
to make computer systems that are honest witnesses to a person's behavior
(incapable of being misused, infected by hostile S/W, etc.). This might apply, as long as the thing that is in the presence of the
private key is a hash value.  However, this is not what I read in the ISO
definitions of "non-repudiation".  Those definitions refer to human beings
and their behavior.
I reject assumptions (e.g., that a home user has kept his computer locked
away so that no one else could get to its keyboard and has kept it free of
all hostile software) that are required to map from the cryptographic action
back to the human action.
I believe that the standard definitions (e.g., in ISO documents) refer to
the first.  This is certainly what the PKI community refers to.  That
definition is not only wrong, technically, it is a violation of consumer
rights if it were ever to be enforced.  As a cryptographic community we
should make sure that no one in the world still believes such nonsense.
What we call the property of public-key cryptography is an interesting
problem.  Spelled out, the only property here is that we can do the same
kind of MAC we've always done with symmetric keys, only the verifier doesn't
need to know the key capable of making the signature.  This is a security
advantage - and nothing more.
The logical fallacy that start with Diffie-Hellman is to say:
1. with symmetric key MACs, the verifier needed to know the secret key
2. therefore, the verifier could forge a MAC
3. therefore, you could not take a MAC into court to prove a claim against
the other party
4. with public key signatures, you don't need to know the secret key
(flawed step) 5: therefore, you can take a PK signature into court.
All these improper assumptions about the behavior of the keyholder are
back-peddling to cover up all the other ways that a PK signature could be
made without the express consent of the alleged keyholder.  That is not
appropriate.  We do not have step 5. We should rid our texts of any
reference to that notion - and work with what we do have.  It's good, but
it's not magic.
 - Carl
To me, "repudiation" is the action only of a human being (not of a key) and
therefore there is no such thing as "cryptographic non-repudiability".  We
need a different, more precise term for that - and we need to rid our
literature and conversation of any reference to the former - except to
strongly discredit it if/when it ever appears again.

Hi Stefan,
IETF work on SPKI/SDSI was stopped.  We do not need to continue
adding new protocols to the SPKI/SDSI family.
There's one draft that should have gone on to RFC, but people were
using it from the draft instead.  It's my fault that we left it at
that stage and didn't publish the RFC.  That's still on my list of
things to do :-)  It seems that other work kept getting in the way.
But the uses of SPKI/SDSI have continued.  Check out
for implementations of and research papers on SPKI/SDSI.  There are a
few other implementations that have not been publicized, as well. SPKI/SDSI doesn't lead to an industry like PKI and isn't a
stand-alone product like PGP.  It's a tool to be used within other
products.  It's also almost exclusively for a closed authorization
infrastructure, rather than an open naming infrastructure.  In fact,
under SPKI/SDSI thinking, a global naming instructure is not a proper
use of one's time and energy.  This is doubtless why the PKI Vendors
react with hostility toward SPKI/SDSI.
Yes.  Check out KeyNote and PolicyMaker.  There are links to those
from my web page.
There is also XACML and there is promised to be WS-Authorization.
Of course, you don't have to use certificates for authorization.  You
can bind an authorization to a key in a protected database (a
key-based ACL, in SPKI/SDSI terminology).  Samples of that are SSH
and X9.59.
We went on to use it in products and research.
We were and are a group of developers and researchers, not standards
writers.  Standards writing is fundamentally boring.

Because of its predominant use in closed, often proprietary systems,
standardization is of questionable value.  As long as each closed
system's vendors (usually 1) agree among themselves on structure
format, they're happy.  Most of the fielded implementations I have
seen would not interoperate with each other, because the vendor took
some shortcuts -- following RFC2693 faithfully, but getting creative
with the structure (the draft).  It worked for them - didn't cause
any trouble.

it to open
about them.
I have to look at this as the result of evolution, starting with Walton's
Mountain - the society humans used to have starting with cave men, where
everyone stayed among the tribe where they were born and where everyone knew
everyone else.  A specially trusted person in that tribe/town might be made
a Notary.  A statement by such a notary would mean something.
So, now that the underlying premises that made it all work have evolved out
of existence (with the industrial revolution), with what do we replace those
mechanisms?  If we don't replace them, they'll just keep grinding along and
being meaningless rituals.
Since these are social mechanisms we're talking about, changing them will
take a few centuries, most likely.  What will be the right underlying
axioms/assumptions a few centuries from now?
What shall we do in the meantime?
Christmas season is ending - and once again I heard the readings about the
edict from Caesar that all people return to their home towns to be counted
in a census.  Maybe we can take a lesson from that - and have everyone
return to people who have known the person, uninterrupted, from birth to the
present in order to get anything notarized.  Anyone who couldn't find such
people just couldn't get anything notarized, I guess.
My bet is that we'll evolve reputation credentials to replace notarization
of identity.  Identity doesn't have much definition any more, since we
started moving from one big city to the next every 4 years.  With luck,
cryptography will offer a real solution - and I don't mean via some dumb
attempt to resurrect identity notarization (a la X.509 CAs).

I might be - and it would be interesting to find out.  However, that does
not necessarily mean that anyone you could find to witness your signature
also has the knowledge to tie you to that particular Dan Geer so carefully
documented in the genealogy site.
I have people who can testify about me - but they're in Chicago and one of
them (my mother) was a Notary at one time, but I believe she has let her
license lapse.  I doubt there is a notary who knew me as a kid, knew my
family and also knows me now and is therefore able to testify that I am that
same Carl Ellison cited in the genealogy records.

Hi John.
Of course it shouldn't.  I was using that extreme example to drive home the
point that the concept of identity (via notary, in this case) has been
eroded out from under us and we don't have anything to replace it with.  My
guess is that a good replacement will not provide traceability but will meet
our needs (for reputation). However, it's up to people like us to design
that replacement.

I, too, would love to get the details, but Peter is right here.
The flaw he reported was in the PKI itself, not in the UI.  If there were a
bulletproof OS with perfect non-confusing UI, once the malware has a valid
signature that traces to a valid certificate, it's the PKI that failed.
As for EV being as meaningless as ordinary certificates, that's the point
Peter is making.  Of course, neither of them certifies the qualities of the
publisher that the end user cares about.  That would be too expensive and
open to liability (therefore, more expensive still).  But, in a verbal shell
game, the CAs make it sound like someone with an expensive certificate is
trustworthy (in the end-user's value system).

Not to be too contrary (though at least a little) - not all of these
are really PKI failures are they?
The malware could just as easily fake the whole UI.  Is it really
PKI's fault that it doesn't defend against malware?  Did even the
grandest supporters ever claim it could/did?
Similarly here - non-EV CAs bind DNS names to a field in a
certificate. No more.  They don't vouch for the business being run,
and in any case any such "audit" would be point in time anyway. I
suppose way back when people "promised" that certs would do this, but
does anyone believe that anymore and have it as an expectation?
Perhaps you're setting the bar a bit high?
