Kahn makes no references to defeating timing-based defenses in The Codebreakers, except for "The target transmits a false timing signal that disrupts the radar’s function and prevents it from tracking him."
His reference to Japanese-enforced delays in The Codebreakers is only:
“In Tokyo, the President’s message to the Emperor had finally been delivered to Grew after a delay of ten hours.  The chief of the censorship office had ordered that all foreign cables be held up for five hours one day and ten hours the next.  The order had been issued at the request of a lieutenant colonel on the general staff, who asked that this be done ‘as a precaution.’  The President’s ‘triple priority’ message arrived on one of the ten-hour days, was stalled for the required time, and was finally delivered at 10:30 p.m., Tokyo time.”
Is there another reference of Kahn’s that more clearly links the Japanese-enforced delays with defeating timing-based defenses?

Except that if you had read the article, you would know that the vulnerable code was written in Java, not C.
From  …
"As seen above remainingData is of type int and calculated from the length of the file subtracted by the MAC length. Since file.length() will return a value of type long and files may be larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE, remainingData will wrap around."

@_subject: [Cryptography] How to make rowhammer less likely 
This is might be too OT, so my apologies to the moderators if they
agree about that, but I believe this analogy to electronic building
locks is not fairly applied.  When power fails, electronic building
locks do not simply remain locked, but are required to at least unlock
in the direction of egress.  They are also required to have a manual
release device that interrupts power to the lock in the direction of
egress, regardless of whether power has failed or not.  And so just as
the door can be more important than the lock, a system can be more
important than its compromised RAM.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Google Titan Security Keys 
Google Titan Security Keys are re-branded and slightly modified
Feitian MultiPass FIDO security keys[1].  Google says they've modified
the firmware to verify the integrity of keys[2].  It's just a normal
FIDO (not FIDO2) security key.  The answer to how FIDO U2F mitigates
against phishing attacks is indeed well documented in many places, so
I'll not try to repeat them here.  If you re-read them and have
questions, though, please do ask.

not a "hardcore" FIDO spec, but I believe might be at the level of

"A post by Stephen Diehl about Facebook Libra is making the rounds
this morning. It makes a number of claims about flaws in the software.
Many of these claims are factually inaccurate. I consider it to be a
gish gallop that bombards you with a bunch of negative claims, many of
which are false or at best, specious."

archive to work with in a subtree and never go out, I'm not sure you need
anything else.
Pardon what might at first glance appear to be self-promotion, but I made
 in the fervent hope that the ideas
it expresses would someday be stolen by someone who wants to rid this
planet of "encrypted" zip files. To Jon's point, it does not express a new
archive format or compression algorithm, but merely wraps tar and bzip2
with a bit of modern cryptography. Please do not actually use it for
anything, but steal from it whatever you like!
