The problem with "nick-name" is it assumes all the names are tied to a "real" name.
Another problem with having a single root or key identifier: who decides what it is? Being able to pick your name has a lot of power to it, and handing that agency over to a third party also hands that power to them. This is one of the reasons that prisoners are often assigned a number they are required to use instead of their names.
If I am going to interact with multiple services, I want control over how I do that interaction. Forcing me to use names that branch off a single origin point defeats the entire purpose.
