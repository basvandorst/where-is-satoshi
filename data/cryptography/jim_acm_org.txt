Since 2^56 blocks of storage is borderline ridiculous, van Oorschot and
Wiener did a nice paper in Journal of Cryptology in 1999 that shows how
to do the time-memory tradeoff.  For 2^40 blocks of storage it takes about
2^72 operations for 2DES.  The equivalent 3DES attack costs closer to 2^175
with reasonable storage requirements.

@_subject: Linux-style kernel PRNGs and the FIPS140-2 test 
Last October in sci.crypt Greg Rose of Qualcomm reported:
- Furthermore, on October 10, a change notice was
- appended to the FIPS, to correct the false-alarm
- rate of the the Runs Test.
He went on to say:
- I believe that the reason the tests were updated
- was because the 1% error bound was too "loose".
- Basically, with about 10 independent tests being
- run, you could expect perfectly functional
- hardware to fail the power-on checks about one
- time in 20, for no good reason. The new bounds are
- still pretty good at detecting true
- non-randomness, particularly the kind that comes
- from typical hardware problems, but with a much
- smaller false-alarm rate. ...
- BTW, I've updated my fips140.c program to the new,
- correct, Runs Test values, and will send it to
- people if they want it. Hopefully we will soon
The internal date on the copy of Greg's fips140.c program
that you included with this message is 2000, so I imagine
you're using the old version.  Have you tried his newer
version, i.e. the one he believes reflects the current state
of FIPS140?

@_subject: Maybe no stego on eBay afterall 
It depends on the program used to insert the stego.  At least
one popular program (popular because it has a very slick user
interface and is free) leaves a clear signature, and, in fact,
is easy to break.  I've extracted the data from some stegged
pictures in puzzles, but have never encountered it in the wild.
It's also possible to detect stego if you happen to find the
original picture that was stegged.
I doubt that the reported eBay sightings were of this scientifically
undeniable sort: if it was more than somebody pulling statistics
out of their -- umm -- noses, it was more likely somebody noting that
the stegdetect program reported "jphide(**)" or some such thing on some
subset of the pictures.  That's not sufficient -- stegdetect reports
the same thing on a small subset of the pictures I've been taking of
my new grandson.

@_subject: cryptographic ergodic sequence generators? 
How about Hasty Pudding Cipher on an n-bit block encrypting an n-bit
counter?  See  .
If 'n' is too small, I suppose you'd run into attacks like the
blackjack 10-count, where you can get a little leverage if the
previous picks have been randomly overconcentrated.  For reasonable
n that shouldn't be a problem.
