Does using PK require a "heck of a lot more power?â
If the device is wired, say with Power over Ethernet, then just use the PK and be done with it.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Would open source solve current security issues? 
While I cannot speak to the rate of change in servers, I can speak to the rate at which iOS devices are updated. It is a rule of thumb in the iOS developer community that 50% of iOS devices update in at least 3 months post OS release. Apple frequently brags on faster uptakes. As a software developer, you plan on supporting the last two versions of the OS, i.e. 24 months of support.
Hence, I think a good estimate of maximum time to repair of security problems in the iOS installed base is 24 months post release of the fix. I believe the 80% coverage threshold is reached well before 12 months post-release. Of course, I cannot speak to the pre-release delays. My colleagues inside Apple though tell me that they try to turn fixes around ASAP.
The Android community has a very different update process. If there is an Android developer on the list, please speak up and correct the following assessment: Some might say, due to carrier incentive structures, the Android device update process is totally broken. If you look at the distribution of Android OS versions, , it is easy to observe significant upgrade lag. IMO, you cannot depend upon security fixes to migrate throughout the Android installed base.

Note: I am not an Android developer. Hence, my Google-fu may be weak and the above may be in error.
It looks like the standard Android libraries are more full featured than iOS’s. More importantly though, the common subset interoperates. I believe, because both mobile OS’s must surmount the same export controls, they have a common crypto feature set. This common requirement enforces a monoculture.
This feature set ripples up into my servers. There is little reason to deviate from this mobile device defined norm on my servers. Yes, because my clients exploit their explicitly parallel performance, the servers may be over loaded processing these older but still quite secure algorithms. Our hardware friends are looking to largely mitigate those issues though.

1) Use just a few crypto algorithms. Learn how they interact. Isolate dependencies.
2) Many crypto sins are made moot by using another random number.
3) Don’t trust yourself. You'll never see the attack coming. Ask friends for guidance.
