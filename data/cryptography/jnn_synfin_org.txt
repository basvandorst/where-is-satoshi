I think they made a movie about this recently, Hidden
Figures... Or wait, actually that was about females
acting as "computers" for NASA in it's early days.
Stuff like project venona in it's early pre-computer days
and basically all code breaking before digital computers
always seems like a titanic feat when I think about it.
Early versions of UNIX had no "more" command because the "terminal" was a fucking piece of paper ;)
We are lucky, at least, that we have reasonable computer systems these days, even if everything else
is beyond fucked.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Apple's 13-month certificate policy 
I?ve found myself doing some odd things to get certbot to generate LE certs for hosts that are either internal using RFC1918  addresses, or hosts that can?t run a web server or certbot for whatever reason. Basically, I setup certbot to run on my name server, where I installed nginx, and where I make temporary zone changes so that whatever host I need the cert for temporarily has an A record that lives on my name server.  It?s obviously a PITA, particularly having to renew the certs, which means making (then reverting) the zone changes at the same time every ~180 days, and it would never fly as a solution at the office. But it?s mostly scripted and keeping me going on my personal stuff ;)
