rights.  Now behold the municipalities, commonwealths and states in which
the right of the people to keep and bear arms (which the Second Amendment
clearly states _shall not be infringed_) has been abrogated in the name of
"public safety."  Given that trend, it is more than idle speculation to
suggest that our lawmakers will walk down the same path on the issue of
cryptography. of course be of limited efficacy: they will limit only law-abiding
citizens of access to tools that enhance their self-defense.  And like
anti-Second Amendment laws, any perceived ineffectiveness of current and
pending law will only result in the political advocacy and eventual
passage of additional laws and penalties until no citizen will venture to
violate them, lest they lose their liberty or station in society. Even so, I do not believe that our government will embrace or adopt such a
rational measure.  Indeed, it would have been far wiser for our government
to have enforced existing laws on criminal conduct before marginalizing
legal firearm ownership...yet we nonetheless have the situation we do
today.  And just as that tool of self-defense has been maligned as
primarily an instrument of the wicked, so cryptography has been cast in an
identical role.  It only follows that a time will come that it will be
accorded the same overt disrespect and negative emotional response that
firearm owners and users endure today.

along.  The latest iteration of GnuPG has been released with a load of
changes and updates, far too many to mention.

@_subject: German authorities bungle wiretaps. 
the U.S. call "hate groups."  While Germans enjoy many of the basic
liberties that we do (freedom of speech, freedom of association), their
government has limitations on such when it comes to extremist political
philosophies such as Nazism.
reactionary political views are far more likely to fall under state
surveillance.  I'm sure that the net.surfing habits of a German citizen
also plays a role, considering Germany's blocking of a number of sites
across the world that are sympathetic to (or supportive of) fascism. that their government spends more time watching those who profess certain
ideas that ultimately got their nation bombed to rubble in the mid-1940s.

that the manual's staples would rust while the components themselves
weren't adversely affected.
around as the genuine article would receive that much more scrutiny.  To
draw a parallel, there's a reason why counterfeiters prefer to manufacture
20-dollar bills rather than 100-dollar bills.  The more common an item,
the less critical any assessment of its authenticity will be.
my experience leaves me understandably skeptical.

Hi folks,
skepticism is now in overdrive.  First off, this is the first (and only) report I've seen on the subject.  Second, I know of several top minds (not
the least of which is Niels Provos) who have sought to verify claims of al
Qaeda-sired use of cryptography and steganography...and all reports thus
far have indicated that there's no evidence to support any such claims.
this article's claims.  I'm including both the URL and the full text of
the article for review. -----BEGIN FORWARDED TEXT-----
The boy who hacked Al-Qaeda
Sudhi Ranjan Sen
New Delhi, May 18
The Americans had tried almost everything, but they just couldn't crack an
encrypted message they came across while investigating the 9/11 attacks.
Finally, they approached a 17-year-old boy in Delhi about whom The New
York Times had done a feature.
Over the next 10 days, Ankit Fardia hunkered down in his room in Delhi and
came up with the key to crack the message.
The worst fears of American investigators came true  Al-Qaeda was using a
sophisticated technology, called steganography, to communicate. It
involved sending encrypted messages concealed in a photograph or series of
I was lucky in some ways but I am still proud that I was the only one in
the world to be able to crack the code, Fardia told the Hindustan Times
from Pune, where he is lecturing students and corporate employees on cyber
security. Fardia is  the author of Guide to Ethical Hacking.
Fardia was understandably cagey about revealing the contents of the
message or the name of the US agency that approached him. In January 2002,
I received an e-mail asking me whether I would like to help the US in
breaking open a message which was of great importance to national
security. I did not believe it was actually from a US agency so I asked
them to send me their digital signature. They immediately sent it back, he
I would not like to discuss the message. But yes, what I cracked was a
message from Al-Qaeda, he added. The US government sent him letters of
US embassy officials said they knew nothing about this. But they said it
was possible for a US agency to make such an approach without keeping them
in the picture.
Fardia said the Al-Qaeda message he cracked had been encrypted thrice over
to make sure it could not be read, even if it was intercepted.
The US is considered one of the leaders in encryption technology, but the
technology used by Al-Qaeda was as good if not better, Fardia added.
