@_subject: [Cryptography] Where are zero knowledge proofs actually used in the 
It seems like in pretty much all cases, it would be cheaper and faster to
just do a public key signature to prove you know your private key. The only
case where I've heard that zero knowledge proofs are actually used is in
Intel's EPID scheme.
Perhaps Fiat-Shamir might be useful for a super-low-power smart card
directly connected to a CPU, since it would be less work for the smart card
than a signature.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Is DAA (direct anonymous attestion) being used? 
The TPM spec includes the DAA algorithm.  In theory, DAA might be used to
assure a verifier what software is being run, I guess.  However, all the
deployed uses of TPM that I know about (bitlocker, emulating a smart card
without letting the potentially malicious software on the PC see the
private key), do not use DAA.
Are there other uses of TPM?  And do any of them use DAA?

@_subject: [Cryptography] Possible reason why password usage rules are 
I've never heard a good technical explanation for requiring periodic
password changes, but wouldn't all the arguments about why it's silly to
require frequent password changes apply to requiring certificate renewals?
(and while we're at it, though I don't want to distract from the "why must
certificates be periodically renewed" question...why does my driver's
license, which proves who I am, not work for getting on an airplane if the
license is expired...I can understand if they won't let me fly the plane
with an expired driver's license, but I'm just planning on being a
