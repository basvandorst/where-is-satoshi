@_subject: Are there any security conserns with using mprotect??? 
This may be the correct forum for this question (and may not)
I am using Darwin (a BSD derivative) and in order to use mlock - you first have
to run mprotect giving read, write, execute permissions on the memory that you
want to lock.
Since the reason that I am using mlock is to prevent paging of the memory to
disk and to add to the security of that memory contents - is the use of mprotect
going to compromise this?  Understand that on this system you can only use mlock
if you run mprotect first.
I can supply sample source code if anyone is interested.
Thanks in advance,
