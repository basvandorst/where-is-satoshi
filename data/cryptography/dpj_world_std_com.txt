@_subject: Criminalizing crypto criticism 
A strange thought,
With these great new laws, there is no longer any risk of being legally
criticised for using even the most glaringly flawed cryptography -- just use it
for Copy Protection, and TADA!  Negative criticism magically disappears.
Almost by definition.
Flaws can only be exposed by those who won't show their work,
or from anonymous sources, who nobody will trust without confirmation
from named reputable sources, or from those who risk going to jail,
who all must surely be disreputable crackpots.
So, I suppose we should be happy that we've removed those nasty costs
associated with developing, marketing, and deploying absolutely perfect crypto,
and on a shoestring budget, to boot. It's a no brainer.  Everything works!
You say it's broken?  You must be mistaken.  I dare you to show me how.
Yet, on a sad note, public crypto research has to stop.
One might think it could survive in purely academic circles.
But no, you'd have to be a fool to criticise even an academic paper.
Anybody, perhaps the resentful author, could co-opt the work for Copy Protection, and off to jail you go.
We seem to be entering the twilight zone -- the end of an exciting,
but brief era -- of public cryptography.

@_subject: when a fraud is a sale, Re: Rubber hose attack 
Authentication of people is an especially subtle engineering problem.
Yet, strong network-based authentication of people does not require
complex secret information ... if "complex" means demanding
at least {64, 80, 128} random bits.
With emerging strong password schemes, your average one-in-a-thousand
or one-in-a-million kind of secret can do some pretty neat things --
in some cases with no need at all for stored secrets,
as in a [SP]EKE password-encrypted chat session.
Password-based techniques is one of the subjects being addressed by the
IEEE P1363 working group, and the apparently successful job of a
number of schemes, some of which are listed here:
(But please don't ask me how this relates to "Rubber hoses".)
(See comments above.)
I definitely agree that the "gap" is huge in most systems.

That's quite the overstatement, easily shown by counter-example.
I know of just a few issued patents particularly relevant to this branch
of cryptography, not including the announced pending one for SRP.
Considering the hundreds of other crypto patents, or the thousands of
software patents in general, this little "minefield" seems relatively trivial
to navigate. These technologies are readily available.
I can only encourage the few bold. or not-so-stingy among us to find their
own way or (dare I say) inquire about licensing.

@_subject: Forward Security Question 
[Std1363] defines "forward secrecy" as the property that:
        "... prevents a passive opponent who merely recorded past communications        encrypted with the shared secret keys from decrypting them some time in         the future by compromising the parties? cryptographic state."
To support its definition of "two party forward secrecy", [Std1363] cites [Gun90]
and [DOW92], the latter of which used (or introduced?) the modifier "perfect".
Anonymous asks:
In the context of password-based key agreement schemes, the term "perfect
forward secrecy" was used in [Jab96] to refer to the integrity of prior recorded
communications in the face of a disclosure of the password.  This fits (at least)
the Std1363 definition, as the password is part of the parties' cryptographic
Anonymous asks:
The same basic [perfect] foward secrecy property is provided in each of
these schemes, as well as several others.
Unfortunately, RFC2828 itself may be seen as good source of the muddle
regarding the term, in it's yet-another-definition of "public-key forward secrecy".

As further precedent, [JV96] provides a definition and rationale for FS in
preference to PFS:
"A key agreement protocol provides *forward secrecy* (perfect forward secrecy
in [7] and [9]) if the loss of any long-term secret keying material does not allow
the compromise of keys from previously wire-tapped sessions.  Since
*perfect* usually makes reference to information theory, we avoid it here."

in Advances in Cryptology -- EUROCRYPT '96, U. Maurer, Ed. 1996, number
1070 in Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, Berlin Germany. [7] = [DOW92], [9] = [Gun90]
Using this definition for a password-authenticated KAP, the password is
considered "long-term secret keying material".

About that MS security response initiative ...
I think, if you view their security response team as a completely
separate independent entity from the MS development team,
you'll find that they're making a valiant attempt at doing an
impossible job.
Scott Culp is just trying to rally the security community to be
self-policing with regard to publishing detailed exploit instructions.
Not a bad idea at all.  And in this regard, this seems to be
handled in a light handed manner ... so far.
When I take off my conspiracy theory glasses, I don't
even see any particularly offensive ideas in his manifesto:
Surely we can all agree that Scott has got the toughest job
in the world. :-)  Maybe we can give him a break and offer some
constructive feedback.
But personally, I don't think there's much hope of changing the way
that particular company behaves, or for that matter, much of the rest
of the industry too.
Not until vendors are held legally accountable for negligent design.
Maybe someday, somehow, there will be a class action law suit.
(I saw a recent infosec conference flyer that had some silly quote
about the annual cost of viruses or something being in the
$100,000,000,000 range.  :-)
Or maybe one of our new draconian laws will be turned around to
make vendors criminally responsible for promoting cyber terrorism!
Surely that'll make 'em think twice before opening that new back door,
or creating yet-another "auto-launch a hidden executable" feature.
