  Enabling rules  on electronic signatures  and records, international
  registry systems and electronic documents of title have all been the
  topics of  recent international negotiation--at the  U.N., the Hague
  Conference, UNIDROIT and other international diplomatic bodies. This

  harmonization work that have a  direct bearing on the development of
  payment and financial systems.
Invited Speaker 2 -- Tim Jones (Mondex)
  Title: Digital Cash - ahead of its time or just a bad idea?
