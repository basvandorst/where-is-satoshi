@_subject: [Cryptography] Heartbleed and fundamental crypto programming 
seen the actual coding error, but the descriptions indicate that an
attacker could cause the server to allocate and return a large buffer,
almost all of which was left uninitialized - and often ended up
containing various pieces of left-over sensitive information from
previously-deleted and now-reused memory blocks.
While I don't disagree with the spirit of your warning, it's probably
worth clarifying that the most noteworthy data at risk of exposure in
the case of Heartbleed is the cert private key. That is, the private key
which, by definition, must remain in memory to en/decrypt traffic.
To all of the media frenzy over credit card information, user passwords,
etc., your points are very duly noted - but the exposure of the site
private key allows retroactive decryption of previously captured traffic
as well as continued active/passive decryption as long as the system
remains unpatched, and said key remains un-revoked.
While observing secure coding practices would certainly reduce the risk
of exploit, increase probability of successful mitigation, and decrease
data exposure following an exploit - again, in this case, that key must
remain in memory for the system to operate.
Seems to me that correctly utilizing libraries with proper over/under
flow guards would nullify 99% (just made that statistic up) of modern
attacks. A red/black library in concert with that, however, would offer
even more protection as you've noted.
However, if I've misunderstood your point, and you're simply using this
as an opportunity to call attention to best practices, then please do
disregard my clarification.

You don't think Go, Rust, or one of these newcomers could fill the gap,
once matured?
The desktop computing platform is just as "slow" now as it was in 1990
for exactly this reason. We seen orders of magnitude gains in
processing, storage, and [both memory and network] bandwidth since then,
but we're still thumb-twiddling for the same order of magnitude of
wall-clock-time on boot or opening a word processor.
It's Parkinson's Law.

I hesitate to applaud such a day. Not that it isn't wise advice to
Encrypt All The Things, but we're lacking the necessary counterpart,
which is serious political momentum to defang (possibly read: defund)
said abusive agencies. As has been opined many times in the past 12
months, it's going to take more than a crypto arms race to achieve what
I think we'd agree is "success" -- in this context meaning "real privacy."
That having been said, Encrypt All The Things!

It's my understanding that most such systems allow the user to opt out
of supplying a wrapping key - in which case the actual FDE key material
is still encrypted, but with e.g. a zero'd key (which the pre-decrypted
system can deterministically generate at boot-time)?
In this case, no security is provided, although there still
*technically* exists both an FDE and wrapping key.

The only "legitimate excuse" for this is a backend infrastructure
which given such a limitation is - by definition - vulnerable to some
form of injection. I'd love to see the following model gain popularity:
  The "strength" of the attempted password is not directly based on
length or character set, but rather actual probablistic complexity is
calculated from same and a target complexity is set as the metric for
acceptability, not directly "8 characters with an upper case and a symbol."
  Assuming proper hashing on the server - another topic entirely - the
passphrase: "airspeedvelocityofanunlaidenswallow" is provably orders of
magnitude (approximately 34, to be exact) more resistant to brute force
than "Monkey1!" yet the former would be rejected by many systems which
would happily accept the later - probably with a complimentary green bar
provided by some jQuery plugin.
