@_subject: [Cryptography] $750k Fine for exporting crypto 
I thought that the initial round of discussion linking this with the Crypto
Wars a few weeks ago was perhaps a bit gratuitous. The United States has
been expanding encryption exemptions, not constraining them. My read of the
settlement was that BIS was more concerned about Wind River Systems having
exported RTOS systems and encryption to the PRC and military elements
therein. That's not a crypto issue, that's broader Sino-American politics.
Everything else seemed tacked on out of necessity.

Well, it doesn't even have to be that cloak-and-dagger. OFAC and BIS also
tend to make examples in order to enforce policies or demonstrate to
policymakers that 1.) policies as they stand are sufficient, or 2.)
agencies are in line with broader foreign policies of USG.
OFAC and Iran sanctions post-interim agreement might be a more clear
example of this. Some of the biggest fines have occurred in the period when
Congress wanted to escalate or attack the administration for being weak on
Iran. I think Wind River went too far in the eyes of BIS on the Chinese
military deals, and they had to act to ensure that other companies paid
more attention. The timing with the FBI announcements, cancelled
conference, etc. align with this.

There is a meaningful difference between VxWorks and consumer operating
systems ? even with regard to the Mass Market Encryption Exemptions. OS X
for example is classified as 5D992, whereas VxWorks is 5D002 ? these
numbers make a huge difference.
Don't sell non-mass-market crypto to the PRC, don't sell to Chinese
military, don't sell to persons on the Department of Commerce's Entities
List, and mind which governments elsewhere.
That's not to say that the encryption export regulations are appropriate,
but the interpretations of BIS's actions seem misinformed.

I am not confident that distinction exists according to the EAR. I believe
the utilization of third party libraries still leads to the software being
classified under encryption export control when the item is considered an
information security or communications product.
