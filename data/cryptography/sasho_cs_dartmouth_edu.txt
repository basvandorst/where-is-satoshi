@_subject: Unforgeable dialog. 
This was exactly what a project in our lab addressed, a few years ago.

 The approach was
to have trusted windows' frames flash randomly but in synchrony with an
indicator window which is inaccessible to javascript etc. The flashing
pattern is inaccessible to unprivileged code, so cannot be spoofed.
Includes some user studies.

university LDAP directory (at Dartmouth). The certificates are present under
key "userCertificate;binary" in the LDAP, in base64.
