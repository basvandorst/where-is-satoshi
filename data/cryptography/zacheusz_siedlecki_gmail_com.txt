@_subject: Question regarding common modulus on elliptic curve cryptosystems 
Elliptic Curve Pohlig-Hellman is comutative. It's quite simple. I've
implemented it.

I think you should look for multisignature schemes. There are lots of it.
And BTW - right EC Pohlih-Hellman is not public key cryptosystem. I
missed your requirement.
