Banks typically aren't that sophisticated.   Demand for this capability probably will not materialize in time to save Pd, although there are probably people working for banks who will claim that they want it.

If you had a choice between buying a DVD of The Matrix Reloaded for a buck and watching it in the big screen for $10, the day of the release, which would you choose?   Do you think that copyright enforcement against movie theaters is an intractable problem?
 From what I've heard, bands make most of their money on touring, assuming that the promoters don't manage to get all the proceeds.   So from the perspective of the copyright holder (the artist, hopefully), as long as, as Ben suggests, the copying is not done for profit, how is it a problem for the band that the copying gets done?   More copying means more fans, means more gigs and more money per gig.   It seems like unless the copying is done by a corporation, against which a lawsuit can be brought, it's more of a benefit than a cost.   So in the case where you'd want to bring suit, copyright still helps you.
