Dear members ,
As a result of last cyber attack that hit many countries worldwide,
our partners from DiploFoundation and the Geneva Internet Platform
have organised an open webinar for the community to provide an
analysis of the main technological, geopolitical, legal, and economic
aspects of the ransomware. Experts from different fields will discuss
why ransomware has become a major issue: Can such attacks be prevented
by technological measures alone? Is there a need for a legal response,
such as Microsoft’s proposal for the Digital Geneva Convention? Is
raising more awareness among users the ultimate solution?
The webinar will discuss whether it is possible to put a stop to
malicious software, or whether they should be considered the price we
have to pay for the many advantages of the Internet. Choices on policy
will have to be made sooner rather than later. The aim of the
discussion is to explore and help make informed policy choices.
How to participate?
The virtual event is open for everyone , just register under this link
: Register to book your seat. The webinar link will be e-mailed to
registrants one hour before the start.
Regards ,

Sorry, Steven, I don't know, but already asked them.  Sincerely hope so.

I said " I hope so" because it's important discussing these subjects
too.  The privacy is being attacked in the whole world, unfortunately.
Hmm...  Did I understand wrongly Steven's question, Mirimir?  Remember
my English is pretty limited yet and I don't want to attack the
privacy, only to discuss it.  :P

Aaaah, I understand his question now!  Sorry, my love, I misunderstood
Steven's comment about privacy questions.  I do *NOT* support "ending
cryptocurrency (esp. bitcoin) privacy & fungibility", neither ISOC
does.  ISOC defends and protects these values.  I thought he wanted to
discuss the ending of them in several countries.  Sorry again!  :P
Pardon, Mirimir, my vocabulary is limited, my English is a disaster
and I need to sleep at least one night.  Not a good phase, my love.
