I came across this paper today while searching for more information:
It's titled 'Security Proofs for the MD6 Hash Function Mode of
Operation' by Christopher Yale Crutchfield (certified by Ronald L.
Rivest).  I thought it might be of interest to the followers of this

This is the same for the state-wide Texas tag, TxTag[1].  If your tag
doesn't register, or you disable or remove it, the toll system can still
accurately bill you based on your license plate and vehicle
registration.  If you're not in the TxTag system at all, they simply
mail you a bill.

I can confirm that they definitely use imagery even when a valid
transponder is detected.  A couple years or so ago I had to put my
vehicle in the shop and use the wife's for a few days.  I assumed that I
could use my TxTag in her vehicle, and it would simply bill my account,
however a couple of weeks later I received a bill for the tolls, billed
to the owner of her vehicle at our address.  When I called to inquire,
they informed me that it did read the transponder, but mismatched with
the plates.  There was a grace period during which I could update the
transponder to the new vehicle and avoid the fines, but as I would be
getting my vehicle back in a few days, I opted to just order a second
transponder for her car.  They were kind enough to transfer the tolls to
the new transponder and waive the fees.
