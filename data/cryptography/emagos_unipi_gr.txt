A 1997 paper might be of great help for you:
Asokan, Victor Shoup, and Michael Waidner. Asynchronous protocols for
optimistic fair exchange. Research Report RZ 2976 ( IBM Research
In this paper, there is a trusted third party (TTP), which is used
optimistically. This means that TTP is only invoqued if something goes
wrong. Although used in the context of contract signing, this approach can
be used in the "certified delivery" context.

@_subject: Zero-Knowledge proofs for valid decryption !! 
There is a list of encrypted messages, published on a bulletin board. Rackel
and only Rackel can decrypt this messages. Encryption is probabilistic, for
instance ElGamal: E(m)=(g^r, h^r  m), where h=g^s with {s} be the private
key of Racel and {r} be a randomness chosen by the sender.
Rackel decrypts E(m_1), E(m_2), E(m_3), and publish the decrypted results in
random order, say (m_2, m_1, m_3). Is there a way for Rackel to prove that
the list of m_i contains only correct open values of the list of E(m_i),
without revealing:
1) the linkage between [E(m_i), m_i]
2) the private decryption key s
(note that she doesn't know the randomness {r})
Does anybody know whether there exists such solution ??.
Thank you in advance, Manos

The background of my question was an auction application where encrypted
bids are published on a bulletin board. All bids are authenticated, i.e.
signed by the bidders. Since there is no anonymity, (there are reasons for
this), the link between the encrypted bids and the decrypted results, which
will be published for verifiability, must be hidden. Note that in electronic
voting, which is a similar application to auctions, the homorphism of the
encryption scheme may allow an observer to "gather" the encrypted results,
and then only verify the "sum" of encrypted votes. However, in an auction
application, this is not the case. So there is a need for the Auctioneers
(they are distributed, for bid-secrecy) to publish a shuffle of the
decrypted bids, and then prove correctness of the decryption in
Although I have read a few papers about mix-nets (in the e-voting context),
I had not realized that the mix idea answered my question (although I should
have :). Thanx for all folks who answered my question !!
