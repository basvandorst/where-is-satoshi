GPS tracking units that you can fit to your car to track where your kids are
taking it (or *cough* other purposes) have been around for awhile now.  It's
interesting to see that recently the sorts of places that'll sell you card
skimmers and RFID cloners have started selling miniature GPS jammers that plug
into cigarette-lighter sockets on cars (general-purposes ones using internal
batteries have been around for awhile).  In other words these are specifically
designed to stop cars from being tracked.
(Some of the more sophisticated trackers will fall back to 3G GSM-based
tracking via UMTS modems if they lose the GPS signal, it'll be interested to
see how long it takes before the jammers are updated to deal with 3G signals
as well, hopefully while leaving 2G intact for phonecalls).

@_subject: Question w.r.t. AES-CBC IV 
Unfortunately CTR mode, being a stream cipher, fails completely if the
IV's/keys aren't fresh (as you could force them to be for SRTP under SIP by
attacking the crypto handshake that preceded it, a nice example of attacking
across a protocol boundary, taking advantage of a weakness in one protocol to
break a second), while CBC only becomes a bit less secure.  In addition CTR
mode fails trivially to integrity attacks, while with CBC it's often more
obvious (you get at least some total corruption before the self-healing takes
The problem with CTR is that, like RC4, it's very brittle, make a tiny mistake
anywhere and you're toast.

@_subject: "Against Rekeying" 
Whose SSH rekeying though?  I follow the support forums for a range of non-
mainstream (i.e. not the usual suspects of OpenSSH, ssh.com, or Putty) SSH
implementations and "why does my connection die after an hour with [decryption
error/invalid packet/unrecognised message type/whatever]" (all signs of
rekeying issues) is still pretty much an FAQ across them at the current time.
(There's also the mass of ancient copies of the usual suspects, principally
the ssh.com implementation dating back up to ten years, baked into networking
devices and whatnot that will never be updated, or at least if significant
security holes present in the older versions haven't convinced the vendors
using them to update them then I don't think the fact that they drop the
connection after an hour will).
