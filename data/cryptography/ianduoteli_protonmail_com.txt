@_subject: [Cryptography] Bitcoin Royale: Peer-to-Peer No-Theft Electronic Gold 
Hash: SHA512
Bitcoin Royale is a protocol based on Bitcoin focused on a specific goal - designing the best store of value and addressing the problem of theft.
GitHub project: Design paper: Some overview:
Satoshi Nakamoto?s original vision for Bitcoin was to create a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash. The majority of successful forks of the protocol try to improve on this vision further and provide a more scalable and efficient system for payments. We see Bitcoin?s greatest promise not as a medium of exchange but as a store of value - a better form of gold, not cash. We propose a set of modifications to the original protocol aimed at fulfilling this promise by creating the ultimate electronic store of value. By increasing Bitcoin?s effective transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes to 24 hours, we are able to tackle Bitcoin?s greatest flaw as a form of gold - susceptibility to theft. A system geared less towards paying for coffee and more towards holding one?s life savings with complete peace of mind, where every transaction is alerted on-chain for 144 blocks and can be canceled on emergency with a recovery key that was never used prior and hence invulnerable. The bootstrap of this system is not via hard fork but through a fairer mechanism of expedited mining, allowing the system to catch up to Bitcoin in a short period of time.
Here is how you can help:
* For constructive feedback on the design, open an issue for discussion here: * This is an open community project, whether you want to code or run a node, please become a contributor on github.
* If you want to run the very first nodes and participate in the genesis - send a message or open an issue.
Thanks for your support,
