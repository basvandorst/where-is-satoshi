@_subject: A crazy thought? 
The CA certifies that X is your public key.  It doesn't know what your
private key is.
If the CA starts handing out false public keys - which is the worst
that it could do, right? - it will find itself instantly distrusted.
Everybody in the world will be able to see that the CA used its private
key to sign a false statement.  The offended party need only put the
false declaration up on the Web.
