I think you are over estimating how entrenched Windows is. First, its not
widely used on server side. Most of the server side is Linux based so if
you are on android or IOS, there is high chance you are not using Windows
on both ends.
Then they also are not as dominant as they were in the 90s and early 2000s.
Apparently, if you consider mobile devices, they make 30% of the computers
out there. So, for this to work, it got to be done across vendors.

Very interesting. This actually explain how Thawte come to existance.
Apartheid came to an end around 1993. Thawte was started around 1995. Its
there likely to assume most of the research he needed to start Thawte was
done under sanctions as he felt he had a market with zero competition.
Would be a very good read.

I wouldn't say that mPesa is issued by telco (Safaricom). Its based on
Kenya shillings.  One just open an account and put the Kenya currency on
the account. Its this currency that Kenya use for trading.
I like to look at it more like moneygram - a mean of transferring cash -
unlike bitcon which is a currency by its own right in my opinion. I doubt
it would be that widely used if its more like bitcoin.
I think its due to the banks not being available to most people.  They used
to have so many requirements that below average Kenya's wouldn't meet. For
example, a minimum balance.
Then there is safaricom near monopoly. This and duo sim phones mean nearly
every Kenya has safaricom sim card even when they use other telco for daily
communication.  Its very hard for mPesa model to take hold if none if the
telco has more than 2/3 of the market.

You might want to ask this over on the anti-spam list SDLU (Spammers Don't Like Us) at  .
Nice, looking for way to improve spamassassin as its allowing a good number of spam through?
I think they are down though? Or did they fold? You subscribed? Is it active?
The lads and lassies there are extremely knowledgeable and helpful.

I believe some of the people here may have taken ?GIAC Web Application Penetration Tester exam. Came across a link on it today at work and felt like it may be something worth looking at.
Have just checked amazon and nothing related with that exam show up. The books from SANS seem a tad expensive. Want to check through the material and see if they are deep enough for such investment.?
How did you guys go about that evaluation? Was the course nourishing enough intellectually for the amount of money they are asking

Really, how can Lenovo fall for this?

There's some interesting buzz online [1][2][3] about "Superfish", a
bit of adware that Lenovo has apparently been preloading on some of
its computers over the past few months.
While preloaded adware is bad enough, Superfish does something even
worse: to allow itself to MITM SSL-/TLS-protected web traffic, it
installs a CA into the Windows trusted root certificate store. This CA
is apparently pre-generated and its corresponding private key comes
with every installation of Superfish. Furthermore, uninstalling
Superfish does not remove this CA, so all users running
Lenovo's tainted Windows installation are affected, even if they took
the time to uninstall Superfish.
A user on Twitter has apparently forged a certificate for Bank of
America's online banking system [4] and I expect that we will see more
of these shenanigans to come to light over the next few days.
According to a thread on Lenovo's customer support forum [1], they are
no longer pushing this adware on customers and are asking the
authoring company to push a fix for this ASAP. Mozilla also has an
issue on their tracker to mark the offending cert as "untrusted" in
NSS. [5]

@_subject: [Cryptography] Secure VNC implementation 
I am suspecting most people in this list work in relatively secure
organizations and curious if anyone has come across a secure "remote
desktop for Unix/Linux).
I did a bit of research on this field and nothing look too pleasing.
The best solution so far seem to be enterprise RealVNC.  Would be
grateful to hear what people think about this solution

Its true VNC didn't have any security by design which mean its a bad
product when one is working on a platform like Windows which don't
have ssh support.  Thanks Albert for your RealVNC feedback.
How is their performance in term of speed?
Appreciate the feedbacks in general.  Was basically asking if their is
any more acceptable solution even if it don't have to use VNC protocol
that people/corporation may be using out there

I would recommend buying Nexus phones from Google.  They get patched
as often as its prudent. Have always been on Nexus on that fact alone,
I can get updates without any extra effort.

Hi Peter,
I agree with you here. We are looking for SCM to replace subversion
and between perforce and git, git do far better job as far as security
is concerned.
What are you recommending to your clients?  Would be grateful for that
info as we evaluate it usage.
