@_subject: [Cryptography] Is LMDPL method against DPA attacks patented? 
Hello all,
There are mainly two methods against DPA attacks. First one is algorithmic
masking that includes changes in crypto algorithms. For example new S-Box
design in AES. The other one is gate level masking. Are these methods have
licensed or patented? Is there any other company than Rambus that designs
DPA resistant AES IP Cores?
Have a good day!
