As a grannie, I must say a clear discussion of how to use this technique is not easy to find.

Right. That's the part I'm complaining about. How does a Windoze user (install and) use mixmaster and where is a mail-to-news gateway that didn't turn off the lights 10 years ago?

Actually, I may have finally solved this for myself. By using the anonymous remailer at dizum.com to send a message to its own mail-to-news gateway, carefully following its syntax requirements, I have been able to post an anonymous message on alt.anonymous.messages that looks much like all the others there. Way to go, Granny!
Of course, if I were to use this for real, I would have to be sure dizum.com isn't a honeypot.

So, does anyone here know what password you have to say at the green door to get an email ID at riseup.net? Not knowing anyone who already has one, I filled out their application in April and have never heard back. Maybe I don't seem shifty enough.

Not excusing the use of weak passwords, but some sites (like Paypal) won't let you paste into the "new password" and "confirm password" fields. Do you want to manually type in a 20 character string from a password generator? I get out the dice at that point.
