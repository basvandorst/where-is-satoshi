Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, John Gilmore
had to walk into mine and say:
Faster computers favour the encoder, not the attacker. In this case, a
faster computer means I can spend more time making the steganography
match the statistical properties of the original image.
How many images are posted to usenet every *day*, never mind the sheer
number of images stored on webservers everywhere. IANAS, but a mere one
million messages is too small a sample set to be statistically
A (paraphrased) quote from a recent TV show:

I'm nervous about (one of) the conclusions being drawn from your work.
The work itself is important, both for the stated goal (to attempt to
refute the USA Today article) and to advance the state of the art of
detection (which will in turn advance the state of the art of hiding).
While it is certainly important to try, I don't think there is any way
to disprove the rumour started by the USA Today article (and continued
in the popular press). People will believe what they want to believe, no
matter how much evidence you pile in front of them, and the media is
notorious for taking advantage of this.
Anyway, let me rephrase my concern.
Statistical research usually expends significant effort proving that the
sample data is *good* sample data. Your paper assumes it. Twice you
claim, without justification, that (paraphrased) "even if the majority
of messages were undetectable, we should still find some messages".
In my opinion, you need discuss the issue, and either support the claim
or mention it as a source of potential error.
Of course, I'm just an amateur...

To respond to a couple of different messages:
Baltimore sold the the OmniRoot to beTRUSTed (the guys who bought the
PKI business) a couple of weeks ago, after selling the hosting business
back in July.
I suspect that beTRUSTed will take appropriate steps to insure the
integrity of the CA keys as part of the transition...

@_subject: Dutch Transport Card Broken 
As compared to slapping your wallet on the reader? yes.
I swipe my Visa / debit / Tim Horton's cards regularly. With the plethora of bad reader technology out there, no matter how practiced I am it sometimes takes 2-3 tries to get a good read. Heck, sales clerks who swipe hundreds of times per day sometimes have trouble. And that's with a relatively easy to read magnetic stripe...
GO Transit here in Toronto ran a pilot program with contactless stored-value fare cards several years ago, which worked quite well; I'm sure technology details are available via Google. Alas, the project got squashed by a political movement for a Greater Toronto Area fare card project (which still hasn't gone anywhere 5-6 years later...).

@_subject: [Cryptography] GnuTLS -- time to look at the diff. 
This is what happens when the software license is more important than the
software itself. GnuTLS exists primarily because OpenSSL's license is
incompatible with (Debian's interpretation of) the FSL, yes?

Anyone hung up on goto should learn that you can write the same code with:
do {
   if (something fails) {
      break;
   }
   ...
} while (false);
This has no goto, but it has exactly the same failure modes as the
goto-laden code (btw, if you're looking for a "goto cleanup;" equivalent in
Java, this is how you do it).
I believe the real issue here remains that writing *and testing* security
code is hard. And re-implementing an essential security library for license
purity is, bluntly, foolish.

Trust a bunch of men to be discussing this. Yeesh. We're the problem, not
the solution.
This is not a technology problem, and not likely one that can be solved by
technology; consent can be revoked *at any time*, including when the
previously willing participant doesn't have access to any technology.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Of writing down passwords 
It should be obvious by now that everything we think we know about
passwords is wrong.
These days I teach this heresy - people should choose really strong,
hard-to-remember passwords, write them down, and stick them in their
wallets. (obviously this doesn't apply to credit card PINs.) This is
especially useful for rarely used passwords (like the WiFi router password).
As it turns out, we humans are much better at physical security, including
things like protecting our physical possessions, than we are at remembering
good passwords.
(Better, of course, is to use one of the software packages that remembers
your passwords for you... ;)

There are far easier (and much cheaper!) attacks on the passport system
than finding RSA-SHA1 collisions. Can we stop with the FUD, please?

In August of 2003 the NE United States and Ontario were blacked-out.
Approximately 55 million people were affected.
It took 24-48 hours to restore basic power, and about a week to completely
restore normal usage.
(There has been a lot of FUD in this discussion, btw. Just sayin'.)

This doesn't get said often enough, IMO. Even protocols that are designed
to have their primitives replaced - the designers think it's easy to do
upgrades, but interoperability problems appear with older software that
can't be upgraded.
SSH is also going through this problem, as the default implementations
first disable and then remove older ciphers that are often the only ones
implemented on older systems (like the aforementioned disk arrays :).
Food for thought...

@_subject: [Cryptography] After Equifax pwning, 
Should probably start by researching what other countries do.
For example, in Canada, a Social Insurance Number can only be used for
interactions with the government. It cannot be asked for arbitrarily
(including as part of a credit check), and it can't be used as a personal
identifier (e.g. employee number, insurance customer ID, and so on).
(There was a lot of trouble with that last one in the late 80s and early
90s before IT people got the message...)
Separate discussion; universal identifiers are bad...

An important difference between drivers licenses / passports and SSNs is
that the former are reasonably tamper-resistant and are multi-factor
authentication (photo and signature), making them much better for ID
purposes than SSNs.
Also properties that can be replicated with crypto :)
