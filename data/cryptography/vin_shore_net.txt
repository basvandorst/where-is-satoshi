Perry asked:
Yes and yes.  Schneier once described Bluetooth as "an eavesdropper's dream."
As you did into this, Perry, you might also want to keep an eye on the evolving draft standards for IEEE 802.15 (Wireless Personal Area Networks), where the consumer electronics giants have apparently demanded a more robust security architecture for the next generation of high-speed low-power piconets.   See: My Bluetooth reference file, fyi;-)
