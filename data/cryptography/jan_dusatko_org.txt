Dne 15.12.2016 v 19:37 Henry Baker napsal(a):
There are also another "world", which need cryptography in cameras.
Police itself, because current digital images are often defeated in
cases by lawyers, because lack of source verification. Any digital
records are taken like suspicious, can be easily modified and nobody can
verify the truth.
Current industry solution are use the metadata in picture format (i.e.
EXIF). But for proper evidence, there are needs to got positioning,
timestamp and camera ID, signed together in tamperproof hardware and/or
use independent certification authority for timestamping of electronic
But there are no such things available.

Everything is about risks and mitigation, but there are lack of useable
equipment. May I'm wrong about, but there are my view on the security,
privacy, unforgivable and provable (of choice) authorship, easy to
detect/defeat any altering. Using "swarm of cameras" or "online
connected cameras" are solution for special cases (hard to defeat in
method that thousands of people agreed of something fake), but general
purpose devices (any recorders for audio/video) missing.
1) provable authenticity of media
- when, where and which items used
2) provable author (better provable on demand)
- who, when, where and which items used
3) security of data
- there are FAT, not the ruberhoose filesystem
- files are readable by anyone with appropriate technology
4) security of media
- SD/SDHC/SDXC (secure digital, can someone use it)
- tamperproof encryption chip with some private values (almost
tamperproof, it is hard to design and expensive)
Risks for each case:
1) Data can be easily modified or defeated...
2) Authorship can be easily forget ...
3) Stole data/pictures/videos, can be easily checked and captured by
anyone, anyone can see the data ...
4) Stole the media/modify data and cryptography signatures ...
I not sure if there are something more than notes only:
- Plaintext data in EXIF are useless, because can be easily modified.
Also, doesn't avoid the tampering/modification.
- hash/hmac or chain of hashes/hmacs cannot avoid modification, because
can be computed again (in case that you have appropriate key, also the
chained HMAC). This mean, hash function are good against random
modification, but for proper procedure digital signature required. And
digital signatures require another mechanisms ...
- best to use some challenge-response mechanism or tamperproof hardware
(what is 100% tamperproof?)
- challenge-response mechanism can help, but better to use 3rd party,
for example certificate authority (X.509 or distributed by blockchain)
Do someone know the solution about?

@_subject: [Cryptography] RSA Crypto is officially insecure due to NIST 
Dne 2. 4. 2017 v 10:00 Tom A. via cryptography napsal(a):
may someone can do better understanding, but this is report about
post-quantum cryptography, not about current cryptography usage.
I not sure what has been changed from a past, but I learned that quantum
attack require this numbers of qbits (I used the same strenght):
RSA, Rabbin, DH - 2x key size (this mean 2kb key require 4kqbits)
ElGamal - 3x key size (this mean 4kb key require 12kqbits)
ECC - 6-8x key size (this mean 224b key require 1344qbits – 1792qbits)
‘m I true?
More, there should be (I don't know current situation well) also
assumption about number of quantum gates to provide appropriate
computing power. This is not a small, formula has been 72*qbits^3
There is significant evolution in near past, but I afraid that we are
years from successful implementation. From other point, the quantum
computing contest has been started and I think that paper only explain
why this competition are required.

=?utf-8?q?_AES_Counter_Mode=E2=80=A6?=
Dne 27. 4. 2017 v 0:28 Jon Callas napsal(a):
This is not true. There are bunch of modes based on CBC principle (PCBC,
XCBC, HCBC and there are more than 20 others, more or less advantage) or
CFB. The CBC and CFB found some issues and there are requirement to use
something like MAC value, because there are simply no control for
possible modification of ciphertext. From other point of view, CBC and
CFB has relatively good properties and oposite of other modes from
ad-hoc generation are quite safe. And, what is funny, although the CBC
needs a MAC, can be used to create a MAC by it's properties (CCM mode is
the Counter mode with CBC MAC)
Stream cipher can be imagined as stream of random, XORed with the
plaintext. Stream of random is the vital properties, we use this kind of
technique also in CSPRNG to assure unpredictable output. But, for
CSPRNG, identical initialization leads to the same output, what is also
important for both sides. The counter modes depend of the counter
properties. Basicaly, there are regular integer counter (regular
incrementation or prime number generated field) and GF(2) body, which
can be based on polynoms. This mean, you need to assure IV and key safe
to provide CSPRNG properties. This can be imagined as:
Random_n =Enc(Key;Counter_n )
      or more specific using the GF(2)
Random_n =Enc(Key;GF(2)_n )
The counter are incremented in each step, but it is known for people,
who know IV and method, how the GF field is initialized. For example,
the GF(2) for AES in GCM mode using polynome x128+x7+x2+x+1, which in
one hands allow to generate about 3,83*1036GF(2)s, from other hands you
are limited to use only 54GB of data before rekeying. Simply because
later you will reuse keys ... which mean key collision. The fields is
generated based on 128b IV. The CCM mode is little bit slower (because there are no CPU acceleration
for polynomials and you need to do encryption two times, one for CTR and
one for CBC). But CCM recommend do not use only 128-bit key, but
256-bit. Also, there are limits from principle, where you do not
recommend to cross over 2^61 blocks.
I recommend do not use CBC mode, but please take a look on the EME2
mode. There are few advantages. First, EME2 has been standardized (but
not used) for storage. Second, this is AEAD (Authenticated Encryption
with Associated Data). Third - ABL (Arbitrary Block Lenght). And, you
can easily modify it for encrypt files only. This mode allow to provide
good safety about unauthorized modification, chain each value inside. It
is much better than for example XEX/XTS mode also used for storage (disk
encryption) - example bellow:
XTS_Key=K_1 ||K_2
Tweak = Enc(K_2 , sector_number) ⊗α^block_number
Ciphertext = Enc(K_1 , Plaintext ⊕Tweak) ⊕Tweak
What could be important, EME2 can be paralellized for encryption and
decryption. The sad part, if I count it well, require 2,5 encryption per
block oposite of CBC/CFB/CTR (one encryption).
You can use the OCB and eventually IAPM, which are quite similar (both
of them described well), but still I would like to avoid cross approx.
the 64GB limit, but this is only probability method, nothing like hard
collision. ChaCha20-Poly1305 is quite better from this point. There are
limits to use signle key for 2^32 blocks, which mean about 256GB of
data. This lead to requirement of some rekeying methods also.
I hope that did not make a huge mess about

@_subject: [Cryptography] XTS mode IV generation 
Dne 1.3.2017 v 1:17 Natanael napsal(a):
Better to explain, XTS using two parameters. let's talk about index1 and
- Index1 are index of encryption block inside data block, for example
AES has 16B size, this mean in 512 block index1 can count up to 32, for
4K block index1 can count up to 256. Index1 can increase up to 2^20,
this mean up to 1048576, this should be a design limit. Means that one
block can grow up to 16MB, but theoretical limit should be arount 2^128
for 16B block encryption like AES.
- Index2 are data block counter, ie. could be a LBA. But typical LBA has
22/28/32/64-bit size, this is why I would like take a look how it is
implemented. Teoretical limit are the same, 2^128 for 16B block
encryption like AES.
Also long key, could be explained as two keys (or first and second half)
- Key1 / primary key, used for encryption plaintext (blocks inside the
data block), should be the same size as supported by encryption
mechanism, ie 128/192/256b for AES.
- Key2 / secondary key, used for encryption index1, result is combined
with Index2. This create a salt, which is XORed with plaintext before
and after encryption. Key size should be the same size as supported by
encryption mechanism, ie 128/192/256b for AES.
XTS doesnt support authenticated encryption (AE) or authenticated
encryption with associated data (AEAD), which in result allow similar
attack (like Evil Maid Attack and others). One encrypted block require 2
Beside this, since 2009 are standardized EME2 mechanism, which are
almost without limits oposite the XTS. Support ABL, AEAD and require 2,5
encryptions per block, this mean not significantly slower.

have a restriction/recommendation in law? Can you provide me link to
this law?
5) Can private organization do develop, use, sell or buy cryptography?
Do you have a restriction/recommendation in law? Can you provide me link

7) Do your country have any other restrictions related to cryptography,
like penalizing of VPN usage, prohibiting secure messengers … and so on?
Also, in case that you have friend around Europe, mainly from EU (28
states), EU cooperative (16 states) or NATO (29 states), their response
will be welcome also. I plan to create map, describing cryptography
freedom mainly in Europe. Also, list of contacts for national authority,
related laws and basic rules. In case that you have any points about, do
not hesitate and please contact me. Comments are welcome. I have been
