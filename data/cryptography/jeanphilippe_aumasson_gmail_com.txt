Shameless plug: I'll give a course "crypto for developers" at the next
Troopers, where I'll address these issues (and also basics of crypto).

@_subject: [Cryptography] "We need crypto code training" and other 
Tentative plan of my training (will be adapted):
1)  Definitions (~1h)
  - The building blocks: ciphers, hash functions, MACs, PRFs, RNGs,
    public-key encryption, signatures, key agreement, etc.
  - Attack models and goals: semantic security, perfect forward
    secrecy, side-channel models, informational vs. computational security
2) Randomness (~1h30)
  - What is randomness and entropy in crypto
  - Examples of bugs and (epic) failures
  - How to use strong randomness, depending on your needs/constraints
  - Which RNG to use? Which API? Which entropy source(s)? etc.
  - How (not) to test your RNG, what tests it can detect
3) Attacks and defenses (~1h30)
  - Timing attacks: principle, examples of attacks, defenses
  - Padding oracles: principle, examples of attacks, defenses
  - Case study: AES cache-timing attacks
  - Case study: RC4 failures (from WEP to TLS)
  - Case study: RSA PKCS v1.5 and side channels
4) Using crypto (~1h30)
  - Review of libs and APIs: OpenSSL, CryptoAPI, NaCl, etc.
  - Basic vulnerability searching (reviewing, static analyzing, fuzzing)
  - AES-128 or AES-256? RSA or ECC? which TLS ciphersuites? etc.
  - What is the right key size? for which application?
  - Testing crypto (it's more than test vectors)
5) Selected topics (~1h)
  - Elliptic curve crypto demystified
  - Password hashing do's and don'ts
