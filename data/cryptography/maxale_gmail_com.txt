@_subject: RNG quality verification 
Similar site aiming to detect defects in various ciphers and hashes:
"...where block ciphers can be compared against stream ciphers,
asymmetric ciphers and hash functions in their quality determined by
the security of each individual component as well as their
"We aim to collect all the existing block ciphers, stream ciphers,
asymmetric ciphers and hash functions under one roof, proving
Shannon's 1949 definition of cipher security to be correct. We also
want to show that cryptanalytic progress of the past few decades has
enabled automated detection of flaws in cryptographic primitives, thus
significantly reducing the amount of time required to determine
security or insecurity of a given cryptographic primitive."

@_subject: A security bug in PGP products? 
Could anybody familiar with PGP products look at the following page
and explain in brief what it is about and what are consequences of the
described bug?
The text there looks to me rather obscure with a lot of unrelated stuff.

@_subject: Factorization polynomially reducible to discrete log - known fact or not? 
Take a look at this paper: Eric Bach  "Discrete Logarithms and Factoring"
ABSTRACT: "This note discusses the relationship between the two
problems of the title. We present probabilistic polynomial-time
reduction that show: 1) To factor n, it suffices to be able to compute
discrete logarithms modulo n. 2) To compute a discrete logarithm
modulo a prime power p^E, it suffices to know It mod p. 3) To compute
a discrete logarithm modulo any n, it suffices to be able to factor
and compute discrete logarithms modulo primes. To summarize: solving
the discrete logarithm problem for a composite modulus is exactly as
hard as factoring and solving it modulo primes."

@_subject: U. Washington Crypto Course Available Online For Free 
I do not understand why this course got so much attention. What is
special about it (besides available video lectures)?
I have a whole collection of links to similar courses. Please take a look at
Just as an example, I can mention UCSD based course "Introduction to
Modern Cryptography" by Mihir Bellare and Phillip Rogaway available at
Talking about video lectures, I was impressed by Workshop in
Algorithmic Number Theory and Workshop in Number-Theoretic
Cryptography at Clay Mathematics Institute:
P.S. If you know other good courses/lectures on the topic missing in
the collection, please share.

@_subject: Status of attacks on AES? 
I think they can prove their evaluation without publishing all the details.
What they need is just to provide an access to their distinguisher in
the form of blackbox.
To prove its meaningfulness, the distinguisher must show consistent
results in distinguishing AES-encrypted data (say, for a fixed
plaintext without repeating blocks on their choice) from random data.

Thanks for interesting info!
btw, do you aware of another MD5 Collisions generating software
(requiring ~45 minutes per collision) available at
I did not find any references to it in Marc's website/paper.

@_subject: Is AES better than RC4 
I'm confused.
AES is a _block_ cipher while RC4 is a _stream_ cipher. How are you
going to compare them?
It is makes much more sense to compare AES to RC6 block cipher (if you
like something from the RC-family of ciphers) but that was already
done by the AES standard committee. RC6 became one of the five
finalists but then lost the race to Rijndael. Look at the details of
AES selection process if interested.
