GPG/PGP Keysigning @ Computers, Freedom and Privacy 2003
April 2nd, 9:45pm (First BoF Session)
I will be organizing a keysigning session for CFP2003. Please submit
your keys to cfp-keys at anize.org and I will print out sheets with key
information in order to speed up the process. Bring a photo ID and a
copy of your key information so that you can verify what is on the
printout. A list of submitted keys and a keyring will be available on:
Thank you...

I usually reserve class three signatures to people that I know very
well. Casual photo ID and fingerprint verification usually produces a
ersion 2 signature from me. Furthermore GPG also allows for the
insertion of a signature policy URL in a signature. The policy URL is a
description of what process you went through to verify an identity...

Should anything be read into the timing of the NIST announcement and the release of this paper a week later?
