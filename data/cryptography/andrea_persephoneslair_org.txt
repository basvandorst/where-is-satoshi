Shor's algorithm is a Fourier transform, essentially.  It can find periods of
a function you can implement as a quantum circuit with only polynomially many
invocations.  In particular, when that function is exponentiation in a group,
it can find the orders of group elements.  This allows finding discrete
logarithms in BQP for any group in which exponentiation is in P.
