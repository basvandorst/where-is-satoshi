@_subject: MD4 and MD5 collision generators 
I am releasing my collision generators for MD4 and MD5.  They have significant
time improvements over the ones described in the papers by Wang, et al.
MD4 collisions can be generated almost instantly, MD5 can be generated in
approximately 45 minutes on my p4 1.6ghz (on average).

@_subject: solving, simplification and factorization... 
The answer you are looking for is Karnaugh logic maps.  This will produce
an unoptimized set of gate logic that represents say S-boxes or E-tables.
same logic map.  Christopher Abad and I researched this heavily a few
years ago regarding DES S-Boxes.
He has provided his gatelogic reduction code on his site, I can send you my generic gate logic optimizer if you'd like.  I have one
for standard (&,|,^,~), mmx/sse2 (&,|,^,~,&~), and vhdl/verilog (&,|,^,~,~&,~|,~^).
Anyhow, best of luck.
