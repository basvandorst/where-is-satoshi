Hey Jerry!
I asked him myself on a different list. His colleague Richard referred to EKE and SPEKE as some of the more prominent examples.

Hey Jerry!
I have no idea about the licensing, but with J-PAKE there is an alternative to EKE/SPEKE which is patent-free, so it might get a better adoption in the future. For me, patents don't make much sense at all nowadays because they are mainly there for fighting stupid legal battles without getting something useful out for the general public but make lawyers rich and push products from competitors away from the markets.
As Ross pointed out in the conversation I was referring to "there were lots of patents issued by companies during the dotcom bubble that tend to be badly written with very general claims that nonetheless got granted by clueless patent examiners". For the time being we need to stick with everything crypto which is very clearly free and open to use. For me it looks pretty much the same problem like with software patents.   fukami
