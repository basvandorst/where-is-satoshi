@_subject: [Cryptography] Show Crypto: prototype USB HSM 
This isn't really a big concern for someone who is looking for maximum
security. Paranoid people would much rather take the advantages of
having a display than the small size. If you're really paranoid you
probably won't keep it plugged in 24/7 anyways.

I would much prefer to buy one with debug ports so I can reflash it in
the future if I have to.
Have you considered a design without the USB head, just have the pins or
whatever you would call them in the board itself like Gniibe has planned
for his new board FS-BB48[1].

It's 2016. Why are you looking for drivers online?

There is this revolutionary new thing called a monolithic kernel.

Following is an interesting quote[1] from the Slashdot thread:
This could set a VERY dangerous precedent.

His belief of this isn't really based on any factual evidence. What they
know is that the person was using Freenet and that his sister is
probably hates him a lot. There are many legit reasons for him using
Freenet, one would be that he had some informant who wants to protect
However the precedent I was talking about was the one that many people
on Slashdot etc. have been mentioning. Anyone could just plant an
encrypted HDD, or one filled with random bits, in the house of someone
they hate and claim that the person has CP. This would make the person
be imprisoned indefinitely with no trial, as has happened in this case.

Of course I believe the guy when there is no evidence at all against
him. "Innocent until proven guilty"
Except that there is zero evidence of anything.
Except in this case there would be evidence that a child was missing.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Public-key auth as envisaged by first-year 
You would have to know in advance how long the connection should take
and during bad internet weather you wouldn't be able to authenticate at
all. Not very useful.

There is also Tahoe-LAFS which is in active development. OFFsystem seems
to be more or less dead.

@_subject: [Cryptography] LibreSSL unaffected by DROWN 
Something that doesn't have feature X is unaffected by an attack
involving feature X!
Here is an incomplete list of other libraries that aren't vulnerable to
  - libusb
  - libmatroska
  - libogg
  - libxml2
  - libbluray
What a non-story.

@_subject: [Cryptography] A possibility of good anonymous communications? 
I don't know about remailing services but at least for anonymity
networks like Tor the idea is that in the future everyone would be using
them. If everyone used Tor it wouldn't do any good knowing that your
target uses it.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Govt Can't Let Smartphones Be 'Black Boxes, 
These companies are siding with Apple for PR. This is also the first
time I see anyone actually call Google Alphabet.
This is what annoys me about this Apple vs. FBI thing. It has made
backdoor a buzzword that technologically illiterate keep repeating as if
it was of any relevance to the case.
Currently only best of the criminals have this possibility. Giving it to
the general public won't make any negative difference.
Unfortunately the US govt is not very small.
Why aren't they helping now?
