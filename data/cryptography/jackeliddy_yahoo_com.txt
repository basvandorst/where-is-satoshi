Interesting part:
"The NCA put the gang under surveillance after receiving intelligence they had plans to illegally smuggle firearms
into the country. BlackBerry phones fitted with PGP (pretty good privacy) encryption software were sent to the
Canadian mounties to be decoded, in order to intercept messages between the men."

2nd Amendment = Right to keep and bear arms. Perhaps you are thinking of the 4th, which protects against
unreasonable search/seizure?

Everything the FBI does is a public relations exercise. That being said, I don't think that the NSA have already
cracked the phone, because that would mean the FBI has based their entire legal strategy around a lie. Perjury is a
crime, and I doubt a federal judge would appreciate being lied to so blatantly in such a public case with
wide-reaching implications and a global audience.
