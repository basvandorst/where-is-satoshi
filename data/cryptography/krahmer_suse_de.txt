@_subject: Just update the microcode (was: Re: defending against evil in all layers of hardware and software) 
The "signature" in the microcode update has not the same
meaning as within crypto. For intel chips it has 31bits and basically
contains a revision number. The requirements for the BIOS for
checking microcode updates are in short: check the crc and ensure
that older revisions cant replace new ones by comparing the "signature".
I did not try myself, but I think one can probably update anything
if you just hexedit the update header.
Afaik these chips do not own any crypto-related functionallity
or storage capability (except precise timing and rand maybe) and
they are not tamper-proof. Thats why TPM was invented :-)

@_subject: OpenSSH patch against traffic analysis 
I wrote a patch to force openssh to use constant time
and packet-size on the SSHv2 connection so observers
of traffic cant correlate SSH connections to each other.

This reminds me the most weird SSL related error message I have ever
seen and which is there since ages:
Beside that the certificate is wrong :-)

@_subject: [Cryptography] Good private email 
Now, thats an interesting point! Once all email is encrypted, how many
mail providers would be interested in offering free service at all,
and whats their business model then?
Is it still valuable enough to sell the graph of connects?

If you are really worrying about that, you are decades too late. :)
ARM-TZ-alike features are already there in other CPU's called SMM, VT-x or SVM,
or in your board called IPMI or AMT - or more generic OOB-Management. Or if you
worry about phones its called SIM and SIM-toolkit (and this list is far
from complete).
Yes, if you want a real trustbase and crypto that stands, you have to open-source
all of it.
Do you know what your keyboard controller is doing? :)
