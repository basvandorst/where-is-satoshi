@_subject: PRNG design document? 
One issue to consider is whether the system
that includes the PRNG will ever need a FIPS-140-2
rating.  For example, people are now working on
a FIPS-140 validation for OpenSSL.  If so, then
the generator for keys and IVs MUST be a FIPS
approved algorithm, whether or not there are
algorithms with better designs.  Some issues like
seed pool management are outside the scope of
the generator, so you can follow good practice there.
     The FIPS-140 vocabulary is "Deterministic Random
Number Generator" which has a "Seed Key" and one
or more "Seed" values.  The two most popular DRNG
are from FIPS-186-2 Appendix 3.1 based on SHA-1,
and X9.31 Appendix A based on TDES.  At the moment,
there is no FIPS approval for AES as a DRNG, though
"real soon now" the X9.31 algorithm will be approved
with AES.

@_subject: Any good books or URLs for WinXP crypto & security? 
I am looking for good books and/or URLs on
the best practices for securing a standalone laptop
running WinXP.  How should the built-in crypto be
configured?  Is the built-in crypto worth using or
is there an add-on product that is much better?  Is there any public review of the built-in crypto design?  I am very familiar with the CryptoAPI and CSP layers, but not the file/folder/partition layers.
    Where is a good checklist of service to turn off
and things to configure carefully?      Yes, I know that a custom Linux system would be better, but that is not an option.
