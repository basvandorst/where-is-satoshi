@_subject: [Cryptography] Fast handling of IP Address changes for HTTPS 
Running a webserver on a home system suffers from the problem of IP Address changes after modem reboot.
In Australia with the National Broadband Network (NBN) I am also experiencing IP Address changes without the modem disconnecting. It may not be general, but in my case it seems that a fixed IP Address is not available.
Also, when server is on a laptop it would be nice to be able to have the server available at different locations.
Using dynamic DNS it takes some time for the new address to work through the system, due to isp dns caching etc.
Having a domain name and LetsEncrypt certificate for the home server what methods are available to handle IP address changes fast.
In researching the subject one solution might be to use a SAN certificate with 2 domain names. The first domain being a site to redirect to the home server using the second domain name. But the redirect would have to be to an IP address, not domain name!
Another possibility is to use "DH_anon" cipher suite but I have no real idea how this works. This would probably be the best solution as I have a secure back channel network that can be used to update the ip addresses and for any authentication and authorization purposes.
Any suggestion how to handle this?

Hi John,
Thanks for your reply.
  
This info is from 2006. I will follow this up to find any details of it's implementation in IOS and This world is fairly new to me.
Presumably the proxy or router must then handle all traffic including the negotiation, rather than just redirect. As you say, not lightweight.

Hi John,
Thanks for your reply,
Although not applicable in my case, checking out "fast flux" makes for some very interesting reading.

Ben Tasker, Michael Kjörling, John Levine, jamesd, Ishmail Kizir, John Denker,
Thank you all for your input.
The network I am developing will have many nodes (with luck 100,000's).
After your input I have totally reconsidered my approach and am now intending to pivot to using AWS  to host the nodes.
This approach if it works out,
  * will simplify and reduce my code significantly
  * simplify management of the system
  * ultra easy for users to become involved
  * faster uploads and downloads
With limited experience so far with AWS (free t2.nano trial) I might be overreaching the scaling limits of EC2 instances, but it is worth a try.
So far my experience with AWS S3 and EC2 has been a pleasant one.

Hi Dave,
Your experience is the same as mine, I had fixed IP on ADSL for many years.
I am looking at a worldwide mass unsophisticated market. For the individual technical user this is not a problem, but the Grandmother situation is what I am trying to handle.
A P2P network with user mobile and desktop  https  access to the node is the intention. Or any other encrypted, authenticated technology.
Another requirement is for the node to be able to run on a laptop and be able to join the network from multiple locations, this is probably the main requirement for a fast IP Address switch.
The system is designed as a decentralized alternative to the centralized situation we have at present.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Verification of Identity 
ProveId is a system I am developing for the purpose of  having a way to prove your identity at very low cost.
The plan is to have users obtain an identity name,  an X509 client certificate and an online image, that is publicly accessible by the identity name.
SDSI certificates develop trust through multiple acquaintances signing an SDSI certificate, I think 5 is the desired no of signatures so I have picked 5 as a starting number for verification.
I intend to verify users by having them provide a list of 5 email addresses that the system will email with basic details and an image and expect a reply with a a Yes/No type response.
  * immediate family member
  * extended family member
  * a close friend
  * an associate
  * an acquaintance
In effect I am treating the recipients of the emails as referees. I keep this list of referees with the users identity record.
Other techniques are also planned to add to the verification.
Before I finalize the system for release I thought I would throw the idea to the experts and stand back for the flack :-)
All thoughts and opinions appreciated.

Thanks for your reply, Peter,
  Is low cost a problem?
Are you saying that it is a problem not worth tackling or are there established reasons to not try.
I can change my approach quite quickly if anyone is able to provide more detail to the problems
Peter raises.

Hi John,
OK, the emails are a bad idea.
The discussion so far and some comments in some private emails suggest, quite correctly, that for all intents and purposes, it is impossible to prove your REAL identity.
What I think is possible is that you can prove the person you are communicating with looks like the image you have linked to a certificate, (in effect the public key).
The main purpose for "ProveId" is to have users in a walled network (all with certificate) aware that the person they are communicating with looks like the linked image.
The verification trust can be built by keeping a count on the number of times the image is accepted by other network members when the image is presented both online and face to face.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Password and Other Encryption 
I am considering using Encryptor4j  for general encryption purposes in my project.
It has this class
    public class AESEncryptorFactory implements EncryptorFactory {
                  public final Encryptor messageEncryptor(Key key) {
             return new Encryptor(key, "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding", 16);
         }
                  public final Encryptor streamEncryptor(Key key) {
             return new Encryptor(key, "AES/CTR/NoPadding", 16);
         }
    }
where the 16 is the ivLength.
Is the algorithm shown in messageEncryptor suitable for password encryption?
Is the algorithm shown in streamEncryptor suitable?
Is anyone familiar with Encryptor4j and have any comments?
Researching this subject reveals an enormous range of opinion and it seems to change every day.
So, as it is always recommended to rely on the experts, here I am at your mercy.

A few points to add
The encryption required is for a password vault.
All password are handled internally and stored as byte arrays.
They are only converted to ascii if and when necessary.

Opinions on choice of  ECDSA-brainpoolP512r1 curve and SHA256WITHECDSA for a root certificate would be the most important.
Are they appropriate for this case or are there known reasons to not use them.
I will get used to the fact, sooner or later, that on the crypto list more specific questions are the expected,
Thanks Peter.

Ahh, those details.
The network is comprised of nodes that each provide services to one or a small number of users, perhaps a family or a small business.
Each node runs a webserver that users access from desktops, laptops or mobile devices .
Each node has at least one end user certificate that is an IP address only certificate for external https access.
A node might also need a localhost certificate and a certificate for internal lan https purposes.
All nodes have a full copy of every other nodes ip address and port. (not a block chain, just a simple fast lookup)
Nodes communicate with each other via tcp and/or udp to provide services to the users browsing the server on their own node. Certificates not required here because the p2p network has it's own DH protocols and does not have to meet the certificate requirements of TLS/SSL.
The reason for ip only certificates is if a nodes IP address changes a new certificate can be issued quickly for the new IP address over the p2p network of nodes and the old certificate destroyed automatically by the node software.
So, an intermediate certificate signed by the root certificate we are talking about will be used to sign end user IP address certificates.
It is in effect a walled network with secure computer and mobile access to it's features.

Seems to me that in a p2p direct encrypted channel the only access to be had is at the end devices after decryption.
The end device could be configured to forward data to "Whoever wants it".
The problem being that "every man and his dog", "Wants it".
A sophisticated user could determine if their data was being forwarded.
Opinions and comments?

@_subject: [Cryptography] In the event of my death, master password 
Trying to work out for my project, how best to handle a master password for relatives and others to access data after death, including data about ongoing subscriptions etc..
Some thoughts
 1. Password in sealed envelope which would be obvious if accessed.
 2. Pin number in sealed envelope which could decrypt the password.
 3. Split password and have friends or relatives have parts.
 4. Shamir secret sharing with friends or relatives.
 5. etc..
More to the point, is how would you (with a technical background) like to access yout parents password for example?
How best would a non technical person, possibly very old, access the passsword with minimum friction.
Links to any previous discussions on this matter would be appreciated.
