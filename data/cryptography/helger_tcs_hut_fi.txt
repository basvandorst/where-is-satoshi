Why just not to use a C code? (Generate an assembly code from that if you
need assembly.) A list of AES implementations, known to me, is available
from  the best (freely available) C
implementation for Pentium III seems to be from Brian Gladman. Use this.
Or do you have any special requirements, like speed...?

@_subject: Rijndael in Assembler for x86? 
First, my question was caused since Perry(?) did not originally specify
*why* he needs an assembly code; and secondly, since the referred 186
assembly code might be slower than the best C codes for Pentium. On the
other hand, the best (commercial) assembly implementation of Rijndael for
P3 is >50% faster (~230 cycles per block versus ~360 cycles per
block) than Brian Gladman's (free) C implementation. Brian's
implementation seems to be almost optimal for a C-code. The reasons why
assembly code achieves such a speedup was somewhat explained in
* Kazumaro Aoki, Helger Lipmaa, "Fast Implementations of AES Candidates",
  AES 3 conference, 2000.
Both this paper, and a compendium of AES implementations are available
from  (if you have anything to add there,
feel free to email me!). I am *not* aware of any free Rijndael assembly
implementations that are faster than 300 cycles per block on P3. I know
that there exist some non-free (including mine) implementations that are
faster, though.

The New Scientist article with the given title,
has a few interesting entries.
The DRM fight is mentioned, also the id Quantique commercial quantum
encryption device. (As well as Great Firewall in China, and Palladium.)

If by good you just mean collision-resistant, then Chaum-van
Heijst-Pfitzmann is a collision-resistant hash function. Recall that CVP
works like that:
  H(x_1||x_2)=g_1^(x_1)g_2^(x_2) mod p
where p is a prime and g_1, g_2 are independently and randomly chosen
generators. (in particular, their mutual discrete logs are unknown)
For any y from Z_p, there exists an (x_1||x_2), st H(x_1||x_2)=y: just
take x_1 to be the discrete log of y on basis g_1, and set x_2=0. It's
just hard to find x_1, if we assume that the DLP is hard. The same
assumption makes CVP one-way and also collision-resistant.
Furthermore, you can extend CVP to arbitrary inputs by using some standard
