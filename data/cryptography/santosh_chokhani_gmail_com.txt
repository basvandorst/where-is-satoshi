Wow.  That is magic.  Do not decode a certificate but verify signature and extract fields.

If I understand correctly, boringSSL goes futher and tries to never decode the cert and prefers to only extract fields on the fly as it needs them.
As for updating the PKIXI spec, that would be interesting to see if it has momentum.  The IETF has, so far, only been interested in nibbling around the edges and doing things like refreshing the crypto (sha2 sha3 instead of sha1 or md5, etc)
