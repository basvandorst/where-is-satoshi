@_subject: [Cryptography] RC4 and SHA2 
Are there any cryptographic reasons that would forbid a (TLS) ciphersuite to combine RC4 and a SHA2 MAC?
Note: I do know RC4 is being deprecated so this is purely a theoretical

Could not agree more with you on passwords' brokenness.
My (current) bet is on FIDO ( which, in its
UAF form, provides 2 factor-based authN. The mobile approach you
described being one of its primary use case.

Here is a quick translation.
As the RAID & BRI police forces were attacking at 4h30 AM to try to capture presumed accomplices of the terrorist attacks (among them, a woman who exploded her vest), revelation about the investigation could reignite the debate on mobile phone encryption.
Based on information from Mediapart, confirmed this morning by Le Monde, the investigators working on the Bataclan (concert hall) massacre have discovered a mobile phone in a trashcan and were able to read its content which apparently was not encrypted as is usually the case for iOS 9 or some Android phones.
On the phone, investigators have found a text message saying "we've left - we're starting".
Even though the name of the recipient and the exact identity of the sender are unknown, the police is convinced this is the message used by the coordinator of the attacks of Friday evening in Paris and Saint-Denis. The police was able to subpoena geolocation data associated to those numbers - e.g. which cell towers got activated - so that they could pinpoint one of the jihadists stop-off points, in Alfortville. A first clue that may have lead the police to the commando entrenched in Saint-Denis, commando that is under attack this Wednesday morning.
On Sunday, Le Figaro published the testimony of a man who was a few streets away from the Bataclan (concert hall) on Friday evening, and saw a black Polo (car) with Belgian license plates and suspicious looking passengers. "I clearly saw the driver and the passenger's faces because their faces were lit as they were typing on their smartphones".
Even though the debate around smartphone encryption will be reignited with this information and Tim Cook's firm position on preserving the privacy of his customers will become more and more difficult, it is important to note that the investigators could have done the same investigation without the discovery of this unencrypted text message. The phone by itself contains a SIM card which allows to retrieve the same geolocation data.

Given that SHA-1 is a pretty fundamental piece of TLSv1.1 (although for
different purposes, it's used in its PRF, but also as signature of
params in the ServerKeyExchange msg) what do people think of TLS1.1's
prospects in mid to long-term?
