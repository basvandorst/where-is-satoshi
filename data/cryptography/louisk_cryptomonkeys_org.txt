It could be done on bootup, and the web server could have a dependency on it (sprinkle in other services as appropriate). It would (potentially) delay things slightly, but the benefits would far outweigh the loss of a few seconds.

Sure, but now we’re getting to implementation questions because we already have an idea of a way we could make it better. It doesn’t have to be perfect, incremental steps is just fine.
If you want to discuss implementation ideas offline, I’d be happy to toss ideas around.
