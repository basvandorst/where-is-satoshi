@_subject: snake oil alert: "Polymorphic Encryption Method"? 
I'm not sure whether or not this is snake oil but it
definitely sounds like it:
"There exists NO method to crack the implemented polymorphic algorithm, a high-performance machine code implementation of the Polymorphic Encryption Method."  "256 bit encryption is regarded as practically and theoretically safe by all serious crypto experts for the next hundred trillion years years or more. Even computers having the size of the rocky mountains and computing at the speed of light would take millions of years to crack the 256 bit cipher which is implemented in the Professional Edition of BPP Disk."  Oh yes, they *do* have a product out there:

@_subject: (Fwd) Key server patent 
FYI, there's more information at:
A cryptosystem having a Certificate (Key) Server for storing and
maintaining certificate or key information in a certificate database is
described. The Certificate Server allows clients to submit and
retrieve keys from a database based on a set of policy constraints
which are set for one's particular site (e.g., company). Access to the
Certificate Server is maintained by a Certificate Policy Agent, which
makes sure that the policy is enforced for a given site based on the
information supplied during the configuration. During operation, the
Certificate Server responds to client requests to add, search for,
and retrieve certificates. The server accepts or rejects certificates
based on configurable parameters enforced by a Certificate Policy
Agent. When a certificate is submitted to the server, the Certificate
Policy Agent checks to see if it meets the criteria for a given site
based on the settings specified during the configuration. Exemplary
types of checks that the Certificate Policy Agent can enforce include
checking to see if the key has been signed by the appropriate
entities and checking to see if the signatures or User IDs
associated with a key are approved for submission. If the
submission criteria established during the configuration are met, the
key is accepted by the server. If the key being submitted does not
pass the policy requirements, it is rejected and (optionally) a copy is
placed in a "pending bucket" where the key can subsequently be
examined by the system administrator to determine if the key should
be allowed on the server. PGP Fingerprint 87AE E858 CCBC C3A2 E633 D139 B0D9 212B

@_subject: Stupid security measures, a contest 
I'll never forget the first time I checked in at SFO International, back in 1996. They were rebuilding the whole place such that the security gates had been placed in the middle of a large room. Of course, one had to pass through these gates but, as is customary, you were not supposed to take bags through the checkpoint. What happened was that I gave my bag to one of those officers, then went through the gate, then was given back my bag which was not being checked at all...

one could argue whether or not the whole bunch of software tools would fit into that category which has been crypto-crippled due to export restrictions and which is, unfortunately, still widely being used.   PGP Fingerprint 87AE E858 CCBC C3A2 E633 D139 B0D9 212B

@_subject: Wildcard Certs 
There's a problem with wildcard certs wrt how URLs are being displayed in many of the browsers, esp. the older ones. If the host name is extremely long the browser will be unable to show the complete URL to the user, with some browsers even inserting "..." into the address window.   Now, suppose I buy a certificate for *.i-am-bad.com (assuming that I'm the owner of that domain). I could then set up an SSL server with a hostname of something like   hoping that the browser will only display the more familiar looking parts of the URL to the user who in turn will happily accept the certificate.  You get the idea.

@_subject: The meat with multiple PGP subkeys 
...and has been answered a number of times. The thing is (and most people seem to forget about this now and then) that most, if not all, of the pgp.net server operators do run their servers in their spare time. Since pksd has a long history of not being overly stable one is happy once the server is up and running. Thus, the never-change-a-running-system paradigm is being lived in this realm.
