@_subject: md5 for bootstrap checksum of md5 implementations? (Re: [ANNOUNCE] OpenSSL 0.9.6f released) 
C for md5 with a driver and test results is in RFC 1321, which is
available in so many public places that it's impossible to trojan.
Of course you need a compiler you trust, as Ken pointed out so long ago.
If I were that paranoid I'd rather trust a C compiler than Perl -
at least I can inspect the (staticly linked) executable produced.
Does anybody offer a public MD5 web service?  Though if your omnipotent
attacker sits between you and the world, this does no good.

@_subject: building a true RNG 
This leads me to ask what may be a laughably naive question:
Do we even know that the popular hash functions can actually generate
all 2^N values of their outputs?

@_subject: building a true RNG 
Yes, but is there any lower bound known?  2^(N-1)?  Or worse?
Clearly a hash with N-bit output that can't generate all 2^N
values can never actually have N bits of entropy.  Depending on how
many forbidden values there are, this may or may not be significant.
Of course if the forbidden values cannot be found, I'd agree with
the "as good as".

@_subject: Ross's TCPA paper 
Do you really mean that if I'm a business, you can force me to deal with
you even though you refuse to supply your real name?  Not acceptable.
I won't give up the right NOT to do business with anonymous customers,
or anyone else with whom I choose not to do business.
The point about DRM, if I understand it, is that you could disclose
your information to me for certain purposes without my being able
to make use of it in ways you have not agreed to.  At least in
theory.  But this debate appears largely to ignore differences in
the number of bits involved.  To violate your privacy I can always
take a picture of my screen with an old camera, or just read it
into a tape-recorder.  I can't do that effectively with your new DVD
without significant loss of quality.
I don't see any technical solution that would enable Alice to reveal
something to Bob that Bob could not then reveal to Eve.  If that's
true, then DRM must stand on its own dubious merits.

@_subject: unforgeable optical tokens? 
Actually, it can.  The server can store challenge-responses in pairs,
then send N as the challenge and use the N+1 response (not returned)
as the key.

@_subject: unforgeable optical tokens? 
In a logical sense, perhaps nothing.  But in a practical sense, two
methods of key agreement that produce equal-entropy keys may differ
in computational cost or latency.  I don't pretend to know how this
would compare with other key derivations on those axes.
The advantage over paper or floppy is as stated - temporary posession
of the token does not allow the attacker to see or spoof future traffic.
However, it would make prior traffic vulnerable, so I must agree that
simpleminded token-based key derivation does not appear to be prudent.
