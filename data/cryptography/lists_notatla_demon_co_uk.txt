@_subject: Constructing "capability" URLs 
You haven't stated what it's for although it looks as if you want to
ensure the user who ran one stage of an app is the same as in a later
stage.  In particular you haven't said whether the page should be
accessed multiple times during the validity period.  You haven't
included a start time to the validity period or stated anything about
secure time at the server(s).
If this was a website where the user might want to share an URL
with outsiders and you might want to prevent deep linking (by technical
means; by far the best way if you care at all) you might want to include
something of the browser properties.
to prevent brute force key discovery by users who have all the other
URL data.  I see no reason to stint on the length - 100 bits should be
Does the old key need to remain in use for a period or are you planning
for rejections at changeover time to be retried ?
Aren't GET-style URL parameters prone to get logged in proxies and is
that what you want ?  POST is usually advised to avoid this.
This crypto-cookie idea sounds roughly equivalent to an opaque key to a
lookup table on the server.  In that case round-robin webservers
might be a bit trickier but it should buy you shorter URLs.
Can mod_rewrite help at all ?  I'm not very familiar with it.
What are you planning to do when the CAP is invalid ?  Divert to honeypot ?
