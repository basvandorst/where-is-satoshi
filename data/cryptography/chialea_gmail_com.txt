Hi Rene,
I suspect from reading this quickly that you may not be a cryptographer. I'd
highly suggest that you borrow one for a bit before you go ahead with this.
I'm having a bit of trouble reading exactly what you want to do, but I am
fairly sure that this isn't as secure as you'd like. (Heck, I can probably
help you out with this, but not today because I'm swamped.)
