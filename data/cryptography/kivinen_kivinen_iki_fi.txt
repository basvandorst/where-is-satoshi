@_subject: Password hashing 
When you are trying to crack password, you do know the SALT and
iteration count. You do not know the password. You need to try all
possible passwords with different salts. As we use the password we are
trying as an input to our test function we need to initialize
hmac_sha1 again for each pasword we are guessing. Or did I understand
something wrong.
With your fix I could take the SALT from the passwd string and
initialize first level of hmac with it and then feed different
password to it.
Adding USERID to the calculations will firstly break API
compatibility, as the crypt function do not know the userid. It will
also break the ability to copy the encrypted passwords from one
machine to other, even when you would need to change user id in the
progress (If I need to set up account for someone on my machines, I
usually either ask them to send me already encrypted password I can
put in to my /etc/password, or ask them to send me ssh public key...

@_subject: [Cryptography] RSA equivalent key length/strength 
I assume that web site only takes account of time, it does not base
its calculations to cost of doing cracking, which would also include
the space needed to do the actual calculations.
Old paper from year 2000 which takes also space calculations in to
says that to crack 1620 bit RSA key you need 10^10 years, with 158000
machines each having 1.2*10^14 bytes (120 Tb) of memory (year 2000 $10
trillion estimate).
Cost of that amount of memory today would still be quite high (at
$3-$10 per GB, the price would be hundreds of thousands - over million
dollars per machine).
Most of key size calculations in the net only take account the time
needed, not the space at all, thus they assume that memory is free.
For symmetric crypto cracking that is true, as you do not need that
much of memory, for public keys that is not true for some of the

@_subject: [Cryptography] Is ASN.1 still the thing? 
I have seen them in the anx Santa Barbara IPsec interop in 1999. There
was CA vendor who was using LDAP server that decided to convert all
ASN.1 DER encoded objects to BER using indefinate form of lengths when
serving them out from the LDAP directory, thus if vendor used LDAP to
fetch his certificate they were not DER encoded. This included
sequences for public key and extensions in addition to first two
sequences. Haven't seen them since, and our certificate library did not cope with
them then (and I think the library might not cope with them even now,
but I am not sure).
