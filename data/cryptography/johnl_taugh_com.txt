Of course.  The payment systems that people use for transactions in
the real world, credit and debit cards, checks, and (outside the US)
bank transfers all have ways to reverse bogus transactions.  Bitcoin's
model is envelopes of cash, too bad if you change your mind.
It's not a technical problem.  The problem is how you tell fraud from
buyer's remorse when someone wants to reverse a transaction.

In article ,
As I think I've said three times now, this is a complex topic and the
question is ill-formed.  You cannot just "canonicalize unicode strings"
and expect to come up with a usable password system.

The compilers actually worked pretty well, give or take the memory scheduling stuff.
Agreed.  I think the reason is that it turned out that a lot of the
hazard avoidance stuff that trace scheduling was intended to avoid
turns out to be doable on the fly in hardware, which makes it easier
to keep those deep pipelines busy.

As I understand it, you can use any bitcoins in transactions in the
blockchain, but you'll have trouble cashing out the tainted ones.

In article <19496554-2b3a-8f88-c998-4e9e738f8770 at huitema.net>,
For most home users, regular NAT has no downside.  It automatically
firewalls devices behind it* and it is not a bug that nothing outside
my house can talk to my printer or other devices on the LAN.  There
are a few home applications that want to see through the NAT, but not
many, mostly multiplayer games.  I agree that CGN where you're doing
N:M NAT rather than N:1 home NAT is a lot messier and harder to
manage, but that's a relatively recent development.  I am surprised that when touting the advantages of IPv6 few people
mention that the giant address space makes it much more resistant to
port scanning.  On my home LAN there are two hosts visible from
outside but unless you had a hint about where to look like a DNS name
it's unlikely you could find them.
* - yes, I know you can do that without NAT, I have IPv6 tunneled onto my LAN too.

ACME works great for Let's Encrypt, but I expect it'll work less great
for CAs that want people to pay.  There's no techical problem to take
a payment out of an account when they do a renewal, but I expect it'll
be a business problem to persuade customers either to prepay a balance
or trust some random CA reseller with their credit card info.
On a growing number of devices there is no visible difference between
what you get with a LE cert and what you get with a paid cert, even a
paid EV cert, so it's another nail in the coffin of the CA industry.

I have LE certs on my mail servers.  They're managed automatically
with acme.sh and some python scripts that use a web API to insert
the validation records into the DNS zones.
If I didn't run my own DNS, this would be harder, but there are plenty
of commercial DNS providers with APIs that allow zone updates.  Perhaps
we've identified a business opportunity.

No, acid-free paper is a standard term for paper that does not
deteriorate as it ages. If you've picked up an old newspaper and had
it crumble, that's due to cheap paper that wasn't treated to remove
the lignin in wood pulp and make it acid-free. Really old newspapers,
from before they started to use wood pulp paper, don't do that.
You also want to use a pigment that won't fade but the toner in most
laser printers is pretty stable.  Some laser printers have an archival
option that slows the printer and increases the fuser temperatre so
the toner bonds better to the paper.
That's just a matter of printing quality.  See above.

It's true, workgroup printers typically have disks so they can buffer
print and scan jobs and reorder them and other fancy features.  The
disks are pretty big, and I wouldn't count on your print job being
overwritten very soon.
On the other hand, there's an easy way to avoid this problem: use
a printer without a disk.  The cheap home printers don't have them.
