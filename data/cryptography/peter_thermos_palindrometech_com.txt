Interesting comment from Skype:
"The disruption was triggered by a massive restart of our users' computers
across the globe within a very short timeframe as they re-booted after
receiving a routine set of patches through Windows Update."
"We can confirm categorically that no malicious activities were attributed
or that our users' security was not, at any point, at risk."
