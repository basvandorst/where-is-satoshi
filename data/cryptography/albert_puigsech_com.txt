There is a MITM but it's not in the connection/network.
I think that's the reason he call it 'self-MITM'.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Compression before encryption? 
Hello Stephan,
Both, CTE and ETC have their pros and cons. Headers of compression format
is not a problem since you can design the crypto system without any
compression header.
Pros and Cons are more related to cryptanalysis possibilities for an
adversary with a wide range of powers.
CTE is good because plaintext has more entropy, and you will be more
protected against some kind of atacks (like statistical attacks, etc), but
you can be vulnerable to some powered adversary with adaptive chosen
plaintext attack (Ref:
 Recently we
saw some attacks on HTTP communications.

If the cipher is good, compression ratios are very low because encryption
increases the entropy. So ETC, is almost the same than E.
The "C" on the ETC has only notable effect on poor crypto systems (for
example using ECB).

@_subject: [Cryptography] Summary: compression before encryption 
what I tried to reflect is that compress after encrypting only have an
effect on some cypher systems. For example for ECB. And It's because the
absence of entropy.

@_subject: [Cryptography] What about TLS and MSL? 
Hello everybody,
I am designing a communications protocol for the communication of some
components. Of course there's no need to reinvent the wheel so I will use
 standard protocols; the idea is to use HTTP (may be version 2) and some
cryptography layer that also allow trusted channel (two-way
authentication), and if possible authorization. For that cryptography
layer, at first I thought of using TLS using  some of the authorization
extensions, but researching I have known MSL from Netflix (
 that also can be an option. I have not
read much about it yet, but it seems a mature project using modern
cryptographic primitives.
Any of you know MSL and has been regarded with deep? Should I value tit as
an option or directly go to TLS?
Thank you!
