@_subject: California appeals court holds that DeCSS code is 
In the main, it is a good decision (available at  but before folks get too excited, a few things should be pointed out.
First, the court made a clear and less than helpful distinction between source and object:
"Like the CSS decryption software, DeCSS is a writing composed
of computer source code which describes an alternative method
of decrypting CSSencrypted DVDs. Regardless of who authored the
program, DeCSS is a written expression of the author's ideas and
information about decryption of DVDs without CSS. If the source
code were "compiled" to create object code, we would agree that
the resulting composition of zeroes and ones would not convey
ideas.  (See generally Junger v. Daley, supra, 209 F.3d at pp.
482-483.) That the source code is capable of such compilation,
however, does not destroy the expressive nature of the source
code itself. Thus, we conclude that the trial court's preliminary
injunction barring Bunner from disclosing DeCSS can fairly be
characterized as a prohibition of "pure" speech."
Second, the court ruled that the preliminary injunction which the lower court had issued was an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech, but went out of its way not to answer whether damages and/or a permanent injunction after trial would suffer the same fate.
Third, this is not a DMCA case, it is a case brought by the DVD Copy Control Association under the California Uniform Trade Secrets law.  The court, without specifically mentioning DMCA, also made the point of discussiing how a claim against DeCSS might be handled differently under copyright law than under trade secrets law.
So, except for the source/object distinction drawn by the court, its a nice decision, but its utility in DMCA cases is questionable.

The case itself is at
         "Finally, Schaub testified that, in a file entitled ?research,? he found the text of Minn. Stat. ? 617.246, which included ?the definition of minor sexual performance, sexual conduct, things of that nature.?  He also testified that he found an encryption program, PGP, on appellant?s computer; PGP ?can basically encrypt any file;? and, ?other than the National Security Agency,? he was not aware of anyone who could break such an encryption.  But Schaub also admitted that the PGP program may be included on every Macintosh computer that comes out today, and appellant may have had the text of Minn. Stat. ? 617.246 in his computer because of prior allegations against him."
         "Appellant first argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the district court erred in admitting irrelevant evidence of his internet usage and the existence of an encryption program on his computer.  Rulings involving the relevancy of evidence are generally left to the sound discretion of the district court.  State v. Swain, 269 N.W.2d 707, 714 (Minn. 1978).  And rulings on relevancy will only be reversed when that discretion has been clearly abused.  Johnson v. Washington County, 518 N.W.2d 594, 601 (Minn. 1994).  ?The party claiming error has the burden of showing both the error and the prejudice.?  State v. Horning, 535 N.W.2d 296, 298 (Minn. 1995).
         Appellant argues that his ?internet use had nothing to do with the issues in this case;? ?there was no evidence that there was anything encrypted on the computer;? and that he ?was prejudiced because the court specifically used this evidence in its findings of fact and in reaching its verdict.?  We are not persuaded by appellant?s arguments.  The record shows that appellant took a large number of pictures of S.M. with a digital camera, and that he would upload those pictures onto his computer soon after taking them.  We find that evidence of appellant?s internet use and the existence of an encryption program on his computer was at least somewhat relevant to the state?s case against him.  See Minn. R. Evid. 401."

@_subject: The HD-DVD key fiasco 
(Links at the site, posted by EFF Senior IP Attorney Fred von Lohmann)
09 f9: A Legal Primer
May 02, 2007
As was reported back in February, an enterprising hacker unearthed and posted one of the decryption keys used by AACS to decode HD-DVD movies (other keys and exploits have been made available in the weeks since). Now the AACS-LA (the entity that licenses AACS to makers of HD-DVD players) has set its lawyers on the futile mission of trying to get every instance of at least one key (hint: it begins with 09 f9) removed from the Internet.
Predictably, this legal effort has backfired, resulting in eternal Internet fame for the key in question. In addition to having been posted on hundreds of thousands of web sites (and resulting in the temporary shutdown of Digg.com), the key has already spawned a song, a quiz, a domain name, and numerous T-shirts.
So now might be a good time to review a few of the basic legal issues raised by the posting of the keys. (This is an overview of the legal landscape, not legal advice, and I am not expressing any view about how a case might come out if AACS-LA sued anyone.)
What is the AACS-LA's argument? In its takedown letters, the AACS-LA claims that hosting the key violates the DMCA's ban on trafficking in circumvention devices. The DMCA provides that:
     No person shall ... offer to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or part thereof that that -
     (A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title;
     (B) has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title; or
     (C) is marketed by that person or another acting in concert with that person with that person's knowledge for use in circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title.
The AACS-LA presumably would argue that the key is a "component" or "part" of a "technology" that circumvents AACS. Moreover, AACS-LA would likely argue that the key was "primarily ... produced" to circumvent AACS, that is has no other commercially significant purpose, and that it is being "marketed" for use in a circumvention technology. The takedown letters seem to take the position that both the poster and the hosting provider are engaged in "trafficking."
The AACS-LA will also doubtless point to the DMCA cases brought against 2600 magazine for posting the DeCSS code back in 2000 (EFF was counsel to the defendant). In that case, both the district court and court of appeals concluded that posting DeCSS to a website violated the DMCA.
Who can sue over the posting of the key? The DMCA entitles "anyone injured by a violation" to bring a civil lawsuit seeking damages (including statutory damages ranging between $200 and $2500 for each "offer"). In addition, if a person violates the DMCA "willfully and for purposes of commercial gain," a federal prosecutor could bring criminal charges (with the famous exception of the Sklyarov case, however, criminal prosecutions have generally been limited to situations where the DMCA violation was also accompanied by evidence of commercial piracy).
What about just linking to a place where the key is posted? The courts in the DeCSS case wrestled with the proper test to apply when someone links to a location where a circumvention tool can be found. Ultimately, the district court held that an injunction against linking could be issued after a final judgment if a the plaintiff could show, by clear and convincing evidence,
     "that those responsible for the link (a) know at the relevant time that the offending material is on the linked-to site, (b) know that it is circumvention technology that may not lawfully be offered, and (c) create or maintain the link for the purpose of disseminating that technology."
The court of appeals upheld that ruling, while admitting that the issue presented a difficult First Amendment question.
What about the DMCA safe harbors? While no court has ruled on the issue, AACS-LA will almost certainly argue that the DMCA safe harbors do not protect online service providers who host or link to the key (the AACS-LA takedown letters do not invoke the DMCA "notice-and-takedown" provisions, nor do they include the required elements for such a takedown, thereby signaling the AACS-LA position on this). The DMCA safe harbors apply to liabilities arising from "infringement of copyright." Several courts have suggested that trafficking in circumvention tools is not "copyright infringement," but a separate violation of a "para-copyright" provision.
It's difficult to say how a court would rule on this question, but it does create a specter of monetary liability for hosting providers, even if they otherwise comply with the "notice-and-takedown" procedures required by the DMCA safe harbors.
Is the key copyrightable? It doesn't matter. The AACS-LA takedown letter is not claiming that the key is copyrightable, but rather that it is (or is a component of) a circumvention technology. The DMCA does not require that a circumvention technology be, itself, copyrightable to enjoy protection.

The more interesting question, which has not been addressed, is whether the CFAA definition of "computer" is so broad that it would include the CharlieCard and/or CharlieTicket.  The Complaint alleges specifically that both are computers.

Nope.  Keep in mind that the case currently is before a Magistrate Judge, not an Article III District Judge.  Apple filed a very short Notice of Objections to the magistrate's Order, but that's just to preserve a right.  In the absence of something unexpected, the Magistrate Judge will decide then (presumably) it will be appealed to the District Judge.  (Technically, it isn't an appeal, but calling it that is close enough for this purpose.)

A number of NorCal folks already have made the trip to Riverside.  They'll be quite

Dear Colleagues,
A group of European security researchers have released a warning about a set of vulnerabilities affecting users of PGP and S/MIME. EFF has been in communication with the research team, and can confirm that these vulnerabilities pose an immediate risk to those using these tools for email communication, including the potential exposure of the contents of past messages.
The full details will be published in a paper on Tuesday at 07:00 AM UTC
(3:00 AM Eastern, midnight Pacific). In order to reduce the short-term risk, we and the researchers have agreed to warn the wider PGP user community in advance of its full publication.
Our advice, which mirrors that of the researchers, is to immediately disable and/or uninstall tools that automatically decrypt PGP-encrypted email. Until the flaws described in the paper are more widely understood and fixed, users should arrange for the use of alternative end-to-end secure channels, such as Signal, and temporarily stop sending and especially reading PGP-encrypted email.
Please refer to these guides on how to temporarily disable PGP plug-ins in:
Thunderbird with Enigmail:
Apple Mail with GPGTools:
Outlook with Gpg4win:
These steps are intended as a temporary, conservative stopgap until the immediate risk of the exploit has passed and been mitigated against by the wider community.
We will release more detailed explanation and analysis when more information is publicly available.
Please feel free to forward this message to those who may be affected.
Thank you,
Danny O’Brien
