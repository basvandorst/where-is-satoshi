Maybe RFC289.
AFAIK it also describes the reason why it protects against dictionary attacks.

@_subject: Did Hezbollah use SIGINT against Israel? 
We can just speculate here, a practice I dislike, but for fun (hey
today is Friday :) ) I'll add my 2 cent here too.
My first thought while reading this article was: "the seed!"
One thing I assume is that they did not break a cipher, even if
the radio equipment uses DES with 56-bit keys I doubt they had
broken it and can break it in "real-time" on the battle field.
All they say is that they can now coordinate their anti-tank forces
better because they know where Israeli tanks will appear on the battle
This can be done with traffic monitoring and some simple math. formulas
to calculate the directions the tanks drive, plus their distance, and
a lower bound of the number of tanks (at least all communicating peers).
But today military radio eq. use frequency hoping based on a PRNG. This
PRNG is the same in every device and needs the same seed to hop to the
right frequency at the right time.
In the last few weeks during the fights the Hezbollah must be able to
capture zillions of messages which all use the same freq. at the same
time. Maybe they did some statistical magic and were able to guess the
seed of the PRNG based on their observations. Or maybe they get access
to a radio device and were able to reverse engineer the PRNG (or just
connect the radio device to a capture device that uses the freq. the
radio device will use). Or maybe it is just the usual war hoax blah blah,
who knows. :)
Whatever... Freq. hoping should protect against jamming only if I remember
correctly. So if I were able to reproduce the PRNG's seed I would use it
to disable the communication between troops during an attack and don't
just do traffic analysis with it. The same result can be accomplished
by let some guys sit in the trees with a spyglass, a compas, and a CB
radio device. ;)
Have a nice weekend,

@_subject: /dev/random and virtual systems 
we are using haveged in our VMs to feed the random pool and
it seems to work good (means: statistical verification of
the output looks good, nearly 0 entropy overestimation, but
we never correlated output from cloned VMs).
I assume feeding the VMs from the host system can be problematic
because the host system itself often doesn't have enough entropy.
Much entropy is needed today for protocolls, session IDs and the

That is true.
Luckily /dev/random is re-seeded during run-time. So even if you do
a roll-back of a system and the new input it non-deterministic it will
generate different output immediately.
I really doubt it. Are there papers about it?
It does not matter if there is one physical disk that is shared
between 1000 processes or between 10 VMs each running 100 processes
(assuming a shared random pool).
The entropy is not generated by the disk but by the processes accessing
it in a (hopefully) non-deterministic way. The HDD interrupts are just
the sampling point. Therefore gaining entropy depends on the level of abstraction where the sampling point is placed. It can be assumed that
the buffered HDD writing and reading on the host of a VM produce
less entropy than the real read(2) and write(2) calls within the VM

Indeed. The boot process of a machine is very deterministic
and if you do not have any Hardware RNG you need to seed
At least old Linux kernels (2.4) also overestimate the entropy
in the pool by about 30% which is especially a problem when you
generate ssh host keys during system installation.
