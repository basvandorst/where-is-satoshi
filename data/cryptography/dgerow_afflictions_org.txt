Adding on to the lists below...
There's a fair bit more work than just randomly signing a certificate. At the very least, the issuing CA has to (/should) verify that the
contact requesting the certificate is a valid contact for the hostname
being requested, and that the domain is even /allowed/ to have
certificates (I'm thinking cryptography export laws, but I may be

Mozilla; I'm not sure if it will ever happen within IE (but they provide
it for the end user to download).
I have heard good things about their service, and I personally use them
to generate my certificates (the price is right).  Dunno about the
supposed security of their signed certificates vs. those signed by
