HTTP stopped being a datagram-like application when AJAX and streaming video became popular.
Yes, there's a message-passing framework still inside it,
because it does some useful things and it's hard to make it go away,
but that's not what people are doing with most of the bits.
It's a somewhat different use case than fetching web pages.
(Attacks like Slowloris or Slowhttp are also somewhat different,
but it's not really necessary for TLS ver N+1 to support those efficiently.)

Obviously anybody who thinks that real cats don't have options has never owned a cat.
"man cat" may not list them, but that's because you're asking a man about cats,
not asking a cat, not that the cat is necessarily inclined to tell you its options.
"cat -h" or "cat --help" doesn't work, because your cat isn't going to help you.
"cat --help food" might work, but your idea of help and your cat's idea may be different.
More seriously, though, "cat -u" is sometimes important,
because sometimes you really do need unbuffered output,
especially if the file or files are devices or other special files.

I'm skeptical - one of the attractions of C is being able to write constructs like
         while (*output++ = *input++) ;
and have them just work (except when they just don't work, of course.)
Sometimes you can make things safer by zero-padding the ends of arrays without telling the programmer
(it wouldn't totally bother me if malloc() automatically added a couple extra words of 0s after the end of every allocation, as long as you didn't tell anybody they could depend on it happening.)
Occasionally programmers have known better, but mostly when they've been switching architectures (e.g. 16->32 bit or 32->64 bit, or when they've been writing on machines where int != long, such as earlier Motorola 680x0, or other weirdness like segmented memory.

I wouldn't be writing crypto-code like that,
at least not without explicitly setting everything up properly and
putting sentinels in the right places
just before running a construct like that,
with comments explaining what it was doing.
But C does invite you to write that kind of code,
promising that (at least if you run it on a PDP-11-like architecture)
it'll really do what you told it to do in the most directly obvious way.
It's your foot, and the compiler isn't going to jog your elbow when you shoot it.
If you run lint, it'll print out "Warning: Dude, that's your foot!"
on some code, but it'll still compile.
Sometimes there's enough information that a compiler could add bounds-checking,
and on some architectures there's probably even an instruction like
         if (++pointer == bound) branch
that doesn't cost you much more time than just pointer++,
but normally if you want bounds checking you have to ask for it
and somebody's going to decide that
         while (output<bound) { *output++ = *input++; }
is too expensive or just not think about it or want to write a strcpy() routine.

Sure, buffer overflows, subpoenas and other forms of social engineering,
phishing to get users to run dangerous things are popular attacks,
and correlating "separately harmless" data or metadata are also big wins.
But there are lots of very widely used non-big-name crypto algorithms that were cracked in the last 25 years
- GSM's voice encryption (several versions)
- GSM's authentication encryption
- The early Microsoft Office encryption
- Cisco router password encryption
- Chip-and-pin systems
Then there are export-weakened things like
- 40-bit DES variants for export
- 40-bit RC4
- Qualcomm's original cell-phone encryption (which Phil Karn said was deliberately trivial, because otherwise they wouldn't have been allowed to use it at all, given the crypto regs of the time and unofficial threats by TLAs.  It was XOR or equivalent.)
Getting closer to real algorithms
- Anything allowing user-selected passwords (Most of which are <20-bit entropy, and a high percentage <7-bit.)
- Unix password encryption, and anything else with <=8-char passwords or written when 2**32 was a bit number
- RC4-128 is looking pretty weak
- PPTP's main problem was using the RC4 algorithm wrong, in ways Rivest said never to do, rather than RC4 itself, but it had other problems
Is it more dangerous to have most people using 2048-bit keys,
or to leak metadata in the key length, given the small number of
conversations between users of key lengths $RANDOM1 and $RANDOM2?
Yup, and a big reason to push 2048-bit keys is to prevent that.
But is there a significant difference between cracking a 999-bit key
and cracking a 1024-bit key which has the top 25 bits == 0 ?

One of the more pleasant episodes was fortify.net publishing their patch
that would turn the 40-bit crypto into 128-bit crypto,
basically by changing a 40 to a 128 in one or two places.
The RC4 algorithm would accept however much key material you wanted to give it,
so the difference was strictly how many bits of the session key to use,
and apparently the code was written straightforwardly.

@_subject: [Cryptography] [cryptography] Browser JS (client side) crypto 
The computationally expensive part of HTTPS isn't the symmetric crypto,
it's the public-key signature step at the beginning (especially with PFS,
which makes it hard for the server to cheat by reusing the same
session key for a bunch of sessions, if anybody still does that.)
DES benefited from hardware acceleration because it bit-twiddled
in ways that then-current CPUs weren't good at, but RC4 didn't need it.
Pretty much true. The original problem was time-delay in session initiation,
which used to be long enough that website metrics people worried about
customer satisfaction and abandoned visits.  CPUs are a lot faster
and have vector processing (SSE,etc.) that can speed that up.
On the other hand, HTTPS-everywhere also interferes with load-balancing,
because you can't just randomly assign pages to a lightly-loaded server;
sessions have to be stickier.
I'm assuming this is humor whooshing over my head?
40-bit RC4 was the same speed as 128-bit RC4.  Web commerce needed
crypto that wasn't trivially broken, to protect credit card numbers,
and realistically, while we got crypto out there and demonstrated
that weak crypto was weak, it was the money and not the civil liberties
that got widespread adoption past the NSA/FBI.
IIRC, from what I read on the net (:-) at the time it happened,
FireSheep was what prompted a number of major websites to adopt https.

The version of BASIC that ran on it (which IIRC was DEC Extended BASIC-Plus)
let you DIMENSION a virtual-memory array, which was stored on disk instead of in core,
and it didn't zero it first, so you could retrieve random blocks of leftover storage,

discarding binary stuff and just looking at text.  In some cases, even
previous versions of the (unencrypted) password file might show up,

These days, most computers represent integers as 32 or 64 bits,

@_subject: [Cryptography] Security clearances and FOSS encryption? 
The most common issues with security clearances vs. FOSS software are bureaucratic, not spooky.
Most of the people who have them are either military (and therefore may have
restrictions on what they can work on in their copious spare time),
or civilians working for big companies (which may have intellectual property
rules that say "anything you work on, even in your spare time, is Ours")
that may not be very enlightened about FOSS.
Some of the higher level clearances have rules about getting pre-approval
for publication of anything that might be work-related,
because they don't want the next Phil Agee publishing a book,
but your developers would know if that applies to them,
and some have rules about what countries cleared people can travel to,
so they might not be able to join your user-group meetings in Iran,
or at least might have to let their security office know they're going.
Back in the 80s, I had a clearance and ran a computer lab where we built models of Stuff.
Most or all of the models we built were unclassified,
and the results of running them on test data were unclassified,
so people could do most of their design and analysis at their desks,
and it was only the Real Data and the Stuff that happened when we
ran the models using Real Data that were classified,
or any word-processing people did about classified stuff.
(And of course every piece of magnetic storage media in the lab
was also classified, because you couldn't trust it not to be,
so you could only bring paper out of the lab, not tapes or floppies.)
If I had wanted to do open-source development of the laser printer drivers
or contribute bug reports about the virtual memory system tuning problems,
none of that would have been affected by the classification issues,
except the inconvenience of paper-handling.

My knowledge of TEMPEST hasn't really been updated since the 1980s,
when I managed an RF-shielded lab with a Vax and some Sun equipment.
We did our testing at 450 MHz, which was a blazingly high frequency back then,
with a room that provided about 120dB of shielding when everything was tight.
It didn't take much of a loose joint to let a lot of signal leak out,
so we checked it periodically, and would need to tighten screws or
replace the steel-wool packing or put copper tape over things to fix it.
The cable ports for our fiber communications had
eighth-inch holes a couple inches deep,
and pushing a paperclip partway through
was also enough to trigger leakage.
It's a waveguide effect, so shorter wavelengths penetrate more easily
(though cellphones do put out a lot less power at 700-2100 MHz than the Vax did at 10 MHz.)
Basically, a refrigerator is unlikely to be tight enough to help;
it's designed to be airtight, not RF-tight.

There are characters that frequently get mangled,
either because they're used as a delimiter,
or because something tried to interpret them specially, or whatever.
If you really really know the password is only going to be input into one program,
and nothing's going to mess with it at all, fine, allow spaces,
but if you expect that a password is going to get handled by CGI, a database,
and a Unix or MS-DOS shell, and PHP and perl, and cut&pasted by various things,
and some application that tries to map characters to web-safe forms, like \\\0x20 or U+0020,
there are lots of opportunities for at least one of them to break the space character,
then you just know it's going to be handled wrong by somebody,
leading to a customer service call because some software you're not aware of munged it.
You're probably safer not allowing it, or at least documenting that you don't allow it,
even if you actually do.
You're probably also not going to allow carriage-return or line-feed,
and you probably won't have to disallow tab because browsers will prevent that.

@_subject: [Cryptography] The proper way to hash password files 
RSTS-11, circa 1973, kept the password file in unencrypted non-world-readable form, but didn't zero temporary files left on the disk.
And the version of BASIC* that it ran let you allocate a virtual array, which stored your data on disk instead of in RAM, and also didn't zero the space on disk.
So in Heartbleed-like fashion, you could snarf up chunks of formerly-used disk space by allocating a virtual array, not zeroing it, and printing out the contents to see if there was anything cool there.
So some curious high school students did this on the time-shared PDP-11 at the university that they connected to from an overused teletype at 110 baud, and while most of the contents were gibberish or mostly harmless, one was from a previous edit of the password file.  We weren't sure how previous, but at least most of the passwords worked.
The mainframe I used as an undergrad was running VM, with several batch-processing system on it, and eventually also CMS, and the batch accounts used 4-character passwords, which would have been inadequate for any serious attack, but were mostly ok since doing brute force with punch cards really wasn't worthwhile.  One undergrad computer operator (not me, but he's shown up here occasionally) guessed that the backup password for the VM operating system was BKUP, so he tried running it as an application program on top of the main VM and giving it one of the guest operating systems as data.  To IBM's credit, it worked ok, albeit very slowly, and to the university's credit, they didn't fire him from the operator job, though they did ask him not to do it again, and changed the password to something less obvious.

and some that don't invert to a unique x, just multiple.

(Also, of course, it's practical to do this for 16-bit blocks,

For a security application, the question becomes what you need it for,
and whether it's good enough to have a function for which you can
sometimes find single pre-images (or a small number of pre-images.)
Sandy said the function needed to have an output as long as the input;
otherwise you could just take some possibly-invertible mix function

If the speed limits using a radio-based system, you can probably trick your car into ignoring it.
If it's a visual code, overriding it may be harder, maybe putting stickers over the camera if that doesn't interfere with other self-drive features, or messages on the OBD/CAN bus if they're exposed.
If it's visual, one third-party spoofing case is putting a bumper sticker on your car with a low speed limit, to chase away tailgaters.
If the speed's marked on the sign by some QR-like code, then you're only going to get individually marked codes if they're printable on the spot, as opposed to baked into the paint.  That's kind of a tough call, because the amount of data you need for just the speed is 1 or 2 bytes, a few more with GPS, but a few hundred with signatures, and the video (which didn't really say how it worked) looked like it was doing an OCR for digits in a circle or the black-slash-on-white sign.

I write a few paper checks a year; my wife writes a few a month, to various doctors who would prefer to accept checks than pay the fees for accepting credit cards.  My bank pays most of the businesses I send "checks" to by wire transfer, such as the credit cards and electric bill, though for smaller businesses they may mail paper checks.
I assume the medical insurance people send my doctors paper checks rather than doing wire transfer, though.

There are fancier versions, if you want a smart-card

but that needs power or at least a bigger antenna.

The surprises for me with the Yahoo breach
- The email from "Yahoo" saying "your account may have been compromised" wasn't phishing, unlike most such mail.
- The spam filter caught the message anyway.
- I had a Yahoo account with my actual name on it that I'd forgotten about, as opposed to just the random john-doe accounts I use for subscribing to newspapers, equipment vendors, and other websites I don't actually want to get email from.

If the user can identify the UUID, and the system can identify the coin's UUID remotely (for duplicate detection), then any geolocation is not anonymous until you give the coin to somebody else, because the person you got it from may have published that information somewhere. So one of these coins would become a tracker.

Yes, it's still meaningful.
If it's hw, you can't update it.
If it's firmware, sometimes you can.
If it's software, usually you can.
(Or if it's an Android OS, and there's a planetary alignment between Google, your phone manufacturer, and your phone carrier, simultaneously with Mercury being retrograde, the moon being full, and you or at least your phone being at a hacker conference or somewhere with 0.5 bars of 2G wireless, then sometimes you can upgrade that too.)

If the system doesn't provide a technical mechanism to require the warrant (PKI design for judges' signatures left as an exercise to the reader), then a warrant is NOT required, it's just suggested,
a SHOULD or even a MAY instead of a MUST.
That's especially true for the "poking around at what else is in the phone" side of the problem, beyond the parts covered in a warrant.

Yup. There was also the payment from 2142137492137974290120978741423427 to 19080985243542309890809fgrwaefv098 which you can "easily" identify as
a payment for 1000BTC of "Services Rendered, not for use in elections"
from "Totally Based In Delaware, Inc" to "Giant Bags Of Cash, LLC"
and the 350 million payments of $99 from random personal accounts
to the "2021 Inaugural Ball Committee".
Corporations were already a convenient way to make money hard to trace,
even before Citizens United, and tumblers make cryptocoins hard if not always impossible to trace, as long as you don't mind the risk that your
coin exchange is suddenly "robbed by h4XX0rz" (unless that's also a
useful way to launder your coins, because the Inaugural Ball Committee
didn't know that random $99 ticket was bought with coins that had
been stolen and tumbled before "Joe MAGA32767" bought it for cash.)
If you want a fully traceable ledger that you're going to require
all political contributions to go through, that's a job for a fully
traceable centralized ledger.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Does RISC V solve Spectre ? 
I read an analysis that said that LowRisc (a minimalist RISC-V variant)
was immune to the Spectre attacks, because they're attacks on
speculative execution, which LowRisc doesn't implement,
and Meltdown (which abuses out-of-order execution as well as speculative execution) doesn't affect BOOM, the Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine,
which was then-currently the only OOE implementation of RISC-V
and which also doesn't implement speculative execution.
That doesn't mean you couldn't build a higher-end RISC-V implementation that has OOE and Speculative, and could therefore be vulnerable to the attacks, and doesn't fit on a small cheap student-friendly FPGA,
but now that we know about those attacks, designers are more likely to
try to prevent them.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Bitcoin is a disaster. 
10 minute transactions are a problem for many kinds of online stores - you lose too many customers that way, and that's not even counting the escrow questions you run into if the customer doesn't trust the seller.
For in-person? Not even close to practical, except maybe things like large drug purchases where you can see the suitcase of product, transfer the money, and not shoot each other, or a real estate deal or bank deposit where you're sitting down at the desk with the manager.
One of the early use cases for Bitcoin was supposed to be "transactions are cheaper than credit card because you don't have all the book entry and stolen card and chargeback issues" - but if they're not cheaper, and they cost you money by being a lot slower, that's not a big win.
An 8-dollar transaction fee that takes 10 minutes isn't going to work for coffee, and doesn't start getting price-competitive with credit cards until around $500, so maybe you could buy a TV with it, or pay rent or something.

I see 2.5 big advantages of RSA over DH
- DH is interactive, while RSA works just fine with publishing a public key and reusing it multiple times.  So for non-interactive applications like email and PGP, RSA's easier.
- DH doesn't directly do signatures, and signatures are not only useful in themselves, but also you usually need signatures to trust the public key parts of DH key exchanges. (Yes, there are El-Gamal signatures.)
- PGP used RSA, mostly ignoring the RSA patents, which pushed RSA to put out a simplified library to retain some control over the process, and the controversy helped popularize RSA.  (That's the .5)

=?utf-8?b?ZSBjZW50dXJ54oCZIg==?=
Pretty much, yes, though there are other models for how you handle identity with RSA if you want them.  Even if they're not used very persistently, at least the recipient doesn't have to do a calculation every time a stranger wants to talk to them.  (There are ways to reduce that effort and risk with DH, e.g. the business about exchanging keys in two halves.)

@_subject: [Cryptography] 'The intelligence coup of the century' 
Back in the 486 or early Pentium years, I was visiting my parents and noticed that my laptop's screen was showing up, shrunken and slightly out of phase, on their TV set. We were guessing that it was the VGA port on the back leaking signal, but it was certainly fun from a TEMPEST perspective - why bother decoding the CPU's signals when you can receive the screen's output directly?
The TEMPEST-shielded room we had in the mid-late 80s was good to about 120dB at 450MHz.  Since the VAX ran at 10 MHz, this wasn't too much of a risk, though the early Sun Sparc machines were probably 100 MHz and may have leaked some harmonics.
