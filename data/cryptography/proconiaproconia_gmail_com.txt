@_subject: [Cryptography] PageRank for people and things. 
Hi,
Have you considered building a "PageRank" for people?
Imagine the following scenario: a meteorite is detected and it is predicted
that it will hit the Earth in 24 months. Suddenly, a worldwide challenge
arises: to arrange a team in the shortest amount of time with the best
engineers in the whole world coordinating world resources in order to work
together towards deviating/desintegrating such threat to human survival.
Idea: a blockchained "h-index" * would solve this in the shortest amount of
A distributed Reputation Engine that would rank items (where items = human
beings or things/resources) according to a certain parameter, be it
"skillfulness at mathematics", "knowledge about meteorites", "leadership"
for people or "durability", "build quality", "performance" for things...,
This could be used not only to deviate meteorites but to manage anything
from running a company or software projects to running nationwide
What do you think?
