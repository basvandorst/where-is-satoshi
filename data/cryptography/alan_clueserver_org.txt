Not really.  It depends on what they are exploiting.  Does every piece of code need to be validated all the time? Once a program is running, does something running in its code space get revalidated or soes it just run?
I don't see how paladium stops buffer overflows or heap exploits or format bugs or any of the standard exploits that are in use today.  (Not without crippling the entire system for bot the user and the programmer.)
It seems to change little for script kiddies if the machines are going to communicate with other systems.  (Unless the DRM holders will control who and how you can connect as well.  And they just might do that as well...)
The perveyors of this also claim it will stop spam and e-mail viruses. They only way it can do that is by making paladium based systems incompatable with every non-DRM machine on the planet.  (So much for getting e-mail from your relatives!)
The only problem this hardware seems to solve is shackling the user into what data they can see and use.  If Microsoft follows their standard coding practices, the script kiddie problem will not go away with this technology. It will probably increase.  And it will be illegal to effectivly stop them.

Try selling a regionless player in this country.  It happens, but not in public.  Region codes make them tons of money.  (They are economic zones, nothing else.)
The think that does not get press is that there is a bunch of money being made on the players themselves.  Having DeCSS allows you to counterfeit players and avoid the licence fees.
It also showed that they were generally stupid gits since the CSS algorythm has only 24 effective bits in the key.  Brute forcing the key once you know this takes *seconds* on my PC.  Snake oil makes the discs play so much smoother...

There is some trading of TV shows, but not movies.  (Some, but only things that you cannot buy legally.)  The few "pre-release" things you find on the file-sharing networks have the same (lack of) quality that the bootleg tapes have. The only large films worth the time are things that you cannot buy.  (Although "Song of the South" should be required viewing in schools.  It makes racism *boring*.)
A XVCD copy of a 22 minute TV show runs about 425 megs.  Anything smaller tends to look like crap.  Multiply that out to a feature length film and you find out why it is impractical to trade films in this manner.  (It is not worth the 2 days it will take for the download. Most people will go out and buy it than waste the time.)
Not to mention the two seasons of Futurama that are only available on Region 2 PAL DVDs.  (Or the other movies and TV shows not allowed by your corporate masters.)  "They Live" is another film only available from Region 2.  Maybe it tells too much about the movie industry...

The reasoning seems to be pure greed.  If you look at the zones, they
are more economic than anything else.
Another theory is it allows them to edit movies for different markets. (Such as what Miramax does to movies out of Hong Kong.  Region codes
help prevent the average viewer from being able to see the film in the
original form and realize just how much they screwed up the film.)
Another argument for the regions is the differing formats for TV
signals. (NTSC v.s. PAL.)  It is a bogus argument as you can find DVD
players that will convert the signal with little or no problem.  (Apex
produced one that was incredibly cheap and works great.)
You made me have to look up what region 6 was.  (Here is a good
reference for those of you who don't know or remember:

Most of the titles i have seen from China are region free.  (Hong Kong
makes a good deal of money from Americans who want to see Chinese films
uncut.  I know, because they are making a fortune off of me...)

@_subject: DeCSS, crypto, (regions removed??!) 
I wonder how they deal with the RCE (Region Code Enforced) discs?
RCE is a sceme that causes the disc not to work in region free players.  If you want a good test disc, try the region 1 version of "Spider-man".  In a region free player it will bring up a map of region codes and make nasty noises about how you need a region one player.  The disc works fine in players where you can set the region.  (Some region ocdeless players can do this, some cannot.)
You can find places that sell region free players by searching on Google for "Apex region free DVD".  The only one I have used is  and I will not order from their insecure web page.

This has already been attempted with video game machines back in the 80s and with consoles like the X-Box more recently.  In both cases, the encryption made it more difficult, but not impossible.
There seems to be this idea that if we just use enough DRM, or enough encryption, we can overcome its weaknesses.  It is like saying if we wish for something hard enough we can overcome the laws of nature.  (And if it didn't happen, we did not wish hard enough.)

Probably because most Americans believe they are being spied on anyways. (And have for a very long time.)
I find it interesting that the question is always about "fighting terrorism".  I am willing to bet you would get different answers if the question was phrased as "Should a president be allowed to carry out massive wiretaps to spy on his political enemies?"
I have seen NO proof that this spying was limited, or even directed towards, "terrorists".  (Unless Democrats, peace activists, eco-freaks, hackers, and the like are now considered "Terrorists".) Since there is no oversight allowed, we must assume that this effort has more to do with rooting out and destroying threats to the President than it does to actual threats to the security of the country.

The problem is trust.
After the NIST/NSA exposures, the feds have demonstrated that they are not
to be trusted to build secure systems for anyone but themselves. (And I
have doubts that they can do that either.)
The politicians are engaging in a massive amount of magical thinking
involving security. The idea that they can demand a feature and it will
only work as they imagine it is folly. (I have seen a few Cypherpunks make
the same mistake. One specific example comes to mind.) A big part of the
problem is one of management. Managers are taught that you don't have to
understand the things that you manage. This means that they are unable to
understand just what these things are used for in the modern world. They
think of cryptography as something only used by spys and terrorists, not
everyone who uses any sort modern technology. (I worked for an insurance
company that used PGP/GPG to deliver financial data to customers. Are they
going to backdoor those transactions?)
To enable the policy that the FBI is demanding would be like a demand to
replace every lock everywhere with one that the feds could easily pick.
The cost would be incredible and the logistics would be impossible. How
would they know if they got them all? How would you test that? What about
all those people who know how to make untampered with locks? Would
locksmithing suddenly become a crime?
The "Do as I say and don't ask embarrassing questions" mentality is a
problem in any authoritarian system. And it seems to be getting worse

Do we really want any "law enforcement official" to be able to read the

is called LOVEINT. Has anyone ever been punished for that? We don't know.
The FBI alone has been burning reputation capital faster than fart in a
frathouse. Instead of trying to improve public integrity, they are just
making shit up and letting the press rip and read it.
