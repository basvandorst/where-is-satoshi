@_subject: Linus: Security is "people wanking around with their opinions" 
Just to clarify: this line of discussion arose from my advocacy of the Linux kernel having a flexible, designed, analyzable and cohesive access control framework, rather than the semantically weak pile o' hooks provided by LSM.
Here's my posting which set Linus off, which itself is a brief summary of already discussed points:
This is not to argue with Linus' point here (which was tangential), just to clarify the context, which I suspect may also be of interest to Peter (at least), as I've been reading his work on the need for properly designed cryptographic architecture rather than e.g. simple APIs.
Unfortunately, there's some very long standing and entrenched confusion over SELinux: that it is a specific access control model, rather than an architecture.  This is somewhat our fault for not demonstrating this concept, and only explaining it, which may be a good lesson for others :-)
