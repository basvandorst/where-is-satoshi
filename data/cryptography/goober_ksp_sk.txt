Not exactly. Consider N = 3*7 = 21, phi(N) = 12, g = 4, x = 2, x' = 5. You'll only get a multiple of phi(N) if g was a generator of the multiplicative group Z_N^*.

You're absolutely right, although the probability actually does not depend on the size of the modulus (in fact, the provable lower bound on this probability goes down with size of the modulus), as it depends only on the factorization of phi(N) which, in turn, might depend on the process used to choose the factors of the modulus (e.g. sometimes-suggested approach of using Sophie-Germain primes creates abundance of generators; whereas some primorial-like construction might decrease it).
