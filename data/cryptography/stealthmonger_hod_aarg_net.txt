This would eliminate the only available technique for strong anonymity
or pseudonymity.  Strong anonymity or pseudonymity cannot be achieved
if there is a direct connection from the sender to the recipient
because it can be traced.  For strong anonymity or pseudonymity, the
only available secure technology is anonymizing remailers with random
latency store and forward.

This would destroy the protection of one who depends on off-line,
message-based communication for self-defense.
Such a person may create and maintain a persistent pseudonym through
untraceable chains of random latency, anonymizing remailers which
thwart traffic analysis through mixing.
On-line, connection-based communication has low latency and can be
traced by traffic analysis.

@_subject: The need for off-line communication [was: Re: 307 digit number factored] 
That may well be, but no claim was made that off-line communication is
as efficient as on-line for introducing and certifying strangers to
one another.  It was only claimed that players who have to remain
geographically hidden would lose their protection if deprived of
off-line communication.  This is because in the on-line, low-latency
case, an attacker can locate the end-points through traffic analysis.
Only off-line does the option exist of untraceable traffic mixing such
as remailer chains.
This subject is on-topic here because cryptography is an indispensable
ingredient of these untraceable traffic mixes.
