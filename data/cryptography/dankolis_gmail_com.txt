Jeremy Stanley  posted a tangle of port to port comm and
a patent.
Just noting there is a policy for RFC's on this, and it does not inhibit or
advance patent application much when a RFC is in the mix...
I'd note to litigants though, if they comb over the submission and look for
non conformity, it might free them from paying up. And that would logically
conclude the open issue, but then again, the legal 'system' is not

The document lacks detail... it's somewhat more of an opinion then
However, that's fine, actions start with intents:
I made a toy blockchain app for a immigration consulting company and the
project disintegrated even before it really started. But when I got to the
HASH ticket for block chain insertions it occurred to me a way to verify
ledgers is made the submission on a node impossible without proving maybe
15:1 other ones in a package. And have those maybe triplicated randomly. So
by frustrating the forward progress of the submission, insiders needs to
find the evil acts or boo boos... This way hundreds of millions of people
could get paid in a dist. leger in a given day and take no miners or
central computing. It would slow down each person, maybe 45 seconds on a

the equity unit called the S.D.R. and when a citizen "gets it" they can't
convert it to spendable without an 'in your pocket' verification of a shard.
I mention this because the paper says: ". checked by miners..." then "check

I went to a Toronto sort of think tank which GULP spent $10 MIliion US of
taxpayer money to buy into fb libra. With VISA AMEX etc in there with fb,

of a tall story to me. But ok. Im not sure If i think ( Im in Toronto )
this throw in is in the public interest. Maybe...

@_subject: [Cryptography] Not so random numbers and really random ones, 
Hello everyone,
Russ Allbery  Noted a day ago bad random number generators
have serious consequences.
Russ A. cited an article at:
Describes a RNG used in Etherium ecosystem that is insanely, inconceivably
I note it is a fundamentally deceiving flaw. For instance, in a program I'm
writing a process makes a filename randomly hoping it never collides with
another issued one. Here are a few from the last few days work:

Off hand, the problem is I might just say: "looking good" and get on with
it. In this apps scope, that's fine actually. But the one described in the
above ends up repeating issued hashes routinely. so this is more like this
block of filenames:

One is repeated in the second block above. If this came from the lower
level code, for crypto its utterly useless suddenly.
You might wonder if its intentional for the Etherium thing...
Anyway, I wrote this post not to rattle on about the above, but note there
is really a fix without ANY maybe in it...
Here's a chip that measures thermal noise and makes numbers:
  Im surprised its not in some motherboards now and supported in op systems
Of course, an A/D converter and a diode will do the same thing. But the
physiological problem as above is a route cause of super duper incredibly
bad RNG's being tolerated.
They take effort to discover. Like the famous talking Barbie said before a
recall: "Math is hard".
Also, it may be possible to cook the books and leave a signature hiding in
an otherwise random-ish hash made. For instance, I think I could make a
`unfixer-upper' that changes the hash and marks it so the S-Box makes
decoding have some detectable property. This means a program of mine would
know instantly which encrypted text will be one of my set aside ones I can
break. The marked property means perhaps only a small number of bits need
to be iterated, like for instance 2^12 and that private key will be
recovered. The conjugate of the S-Box is the point of departure for the
experiment, or crime-project, depending on your motive.... This is much
harder to detect as a black hat act then simply reusing a hash commissioned
number 100% intact. So for instance, if this was applied to Blockchain or
Etherium at the 1% level, a black hat program could reliably hyjack any of
that percentage at will with ease and without any supercomputing ...
Nothing to it. Finding properties that live thru the S-Box(es) for marking
actual messages is probably hard. But they only need to `live a little' and
be detectable statistically. If 2^12 tries are applied to a false pick, so
Time for Hardware RNG's.
Of course, linux has a hook for such a thing:
`` The hw_random framework is software that makes use of a special hardware
feature on your CPU or motherboard, a Random Number Generator (RNG). The
software has two parts: a core providing the /dev/hwrng character device
and its sysfs support, plus a hardware-specific driver that plugs into that
core. ``
Source: But if the hardware doesn't have it, its uncool to pretend a program is as
good, when at least some as above, are very troubling....
Funny just typing randomly on a keyboard under your direct control is much
better then an unseen program:

Hmmm did you notice that is the repeater, or did you think I wiggle typed

Hello to all,
if your like me, you enjoy thinking some good thing is happening when your
http is rewritten to https automatically.
What is under the covers here ? We knows its "SSH". But some more detail is
good to know:
It begins:
Secure Shell (SSH) is a widely used Transport Layer Protocol to secure
connections between clients and servers. SSH is the underlying protocol
that Teleport uses to secure connections between clients and servers. Below
is a relatively brief description of the handshake that occurs to establish
a secure channel between a client and a server.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Trusting companies has nothing to do with the 
I read the last rattle on's about companies and deviations from best
practices for security in routers, other stuff sold like that.
Heres the simple reality: Upper management don't care in the
slightest about details of products, regarding security or features.
The only two questions are: How much and when.
Some unnamed, unloved techno-grunt deep in the company entirely defines its
approach toward security for whatever product he/she manages. All there
emails and memos about security, are politely files and never read.
If some bad thing happens, they are used to blame them, independent of
You can't trust s/w you can't see, even if you see it, you probably don't
see all of it. And the pretence of looking after end user interests is
entirely superficial window dressing. the management that make that
entirely care you believe it. Whether it's true, means nothing to them.
They do hope it's true, as long as it doesn't cost anything to achieve or
generate a delay to actually do. Testing is the ultimate in an
unnecessary expense. Pretending to test, again, is very important. Why test
? If it fails, customers will send you messages.
Security is definitely a super yawn issue, the very lowest of the low for
concerns. There's lots of other situations, people, systems or warning to
blame besides the stuff you made. Why not spend to fix a pothole in the
parking lot instead ? That's visible.
So SImple.
