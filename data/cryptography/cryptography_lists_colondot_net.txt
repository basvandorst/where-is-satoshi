public key operations are significantly faster than private key ones. So it
is far easier to check 500 sigs than to generate them in the first place.

[backdoored network cards]
Surely the obvious thing is that you build a network card without
this property, and get it certified, and get the key to decrypt
the data. Then you add the backdooring technology, at which point
you have the advantage that you both have a certified "secure" network card, and the key to decrypt data for you on the bus.
Not that I'm sure this helps, but it might.

Erm, what things do you think you can sacrifice? Pointer arithmetic,
perhaps, except that it's a fairly fundamental part of C. The problems
of buffer overflows are slightly screwy. Can you tell me, for example,
what the length of s needs to be on
a) a 32-bit machine
b) a 64-bit machine
and notice that most people don't even consider this.
  sprintf(s,"%l",long_val);
And, how big (on the same platforms) is:
  sprintf(s,"%lf",double_val);
You should also note that snprintf(3) is widely regarded as non-portable
due to its non-existence on many platforms.
Most code is susceptible to this kind of thing, because people don't
necessarily know to look for it.

@_subject: E-voting paper analyzes "usability" problems of current systems 
I don't know how you do it in the US, but in the UK, votes are not strictly
anonymous. It is a question of who has access to which paper trails that
make it "effectively" anonymous. I suspect, then, that this proof can
extend to paper-based voting in exactly the same way.

@_subject: What email encryption is actually in use? 
I have to say that much as it is a laudable goal to get widespread
encryption on the SMTP server network, I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion
that opportunistic encryption in this way doesn't really work. Consider
where one side believes that it will only accept certificates signed by a
particular CA (a perfectly plausible scenario in the case of SSL/TLS), and
I hand it a self-signed one - this is not communicable before the connection
starts up, and in-protocol, a failure to apply policy causes the connection
to be shut down (this is by no means the only one, consider one side that
only use DES and the other that never use it), leaving the connection in an
undefined state.
The problem with this is obvious. You have to treat the failure as a
temporary failure and try again in a bit. Of course, we know that the
only way you're going to send this system mail is by sending it in plaintext,
because otherwise you won't adhere to policy, but also, given that it's an
automated service, there's no human to turn round and try something slightly
different, as there is in the case of the Web Browser or mail client talking
I remain to be convinced on the value of opportunistic encryption. In my
mind it doesn't, apparently, do anything useful. Of course, properly
configured SSL, I'd agree with, but that means advertising what you're
going to talk in some way that means you won't get half way through the
protocol and leave it in an undefined state.

@_subject: Open Source Embedded SSL - (License and Memory) 
[Bill went on to say that you might use SSL for such things, as it's had
 lots of design effort].
If you're using wireless then SSL isn't really an option, unless you
layer something like TCP over the top. A large part of SSL's anti-replay
security relies on it running on a reliable channel, so sequence numbers
monotonically increase at a constant rate. (this is also for attempted
message injection). Also, AIUI, *any* crypto failure causes a shutdown
of the protocol, rather than it just being ignored, as it might be in an
unreliable stream.

@_subject: Columbia crypto box 
You NEVER, EVER, re-use the key for a stream cipher, if you do, you might
as well just give up. By re-using the key, I can get
plaintext (combinator) plaintext, which is easier to solve than
plaintext (combinator) cipherstream.
It's one of those things, like re-using a pad.

@_subject: LibTomNet [v0.01] 
I agree with this.
To my mind, one of the things that's been unstated in this thread is
that Tom should have looked at the protections involved in the SSL
streams (all the anti-replay, message integrity etc), but concentrated
on stripping down the unnecessary overhead of, for example, ciphersuite
negotiation and other bits of protocol which are the plumbing part of
SSL rather than the cryptographic parts.
As someone who has read parts of the OpenSSL 0.9.7 source, I'm sure
that it is possible to implement SSL with less obscurity layers than
the general purpose library. If you can skip out the cipher and protocol
parameter negotation then you can probably reduce the complexity down to a
truly manageable level (rather than a possible nasty in the state
machine (he says, thinking back to the vulnerability in OpenSSL a year
ago)) and hopefully without changing the security of the stream protocol
Of course that doesn't help if what you really need is a general-purpose
secure socket transport ;-)

Don't knock this warning, it might be enough of an indication to the user
that something is not quite right. "But I've logged into e-gold before,
and it never said this...". It certainly should be. In most browsers,
though, there isn't even that, by default, at least, IMLE.

@_subject: Session Fixation Vulnerability in Web Based Apps 
It's not a question of whether it's secure or not, in any kind of environment
with distributed proxies, it just plain won't work.
A more useful fix is to not allow arbitrary sessionids to be created, and
generate the state on login, and destroy it on logout. There may be a
condition I've missed with this, but I'm not sure.

Can your mother sail a boat? Worth noting that more expensive doesn't
necessarily make the boat easier to sail (in fact there are more things
to tune, in general), and at the point that you're getting a million
pound yacht, you'll probably be hiring someone very qualified to skipper
it for you... Is that a useful comparison then to security software? I
would expect a competent sailor to be able to weather some storms in a
rowboat, where, your mother (to use the example above) would fail. If
we carry the discussion to its logical conclusion: I'd therefore expect
someone who understands about security to be able to use available
security software with a reasonable ability to keep their data safe.
Useability and cost are not necessarily related. This discussion
is conflating both things. In the security software case, the
useability is not there yet at all, the cost is generally fine.
The question you want to be asking is "what can be done to make the
available software useable safely by my mother?"

@_subject: ID "theft" -- so what? 
I went to pay my credit card bill today via a transfer out of my current
account. The amount was 714 quid or so. When I do this, I normally have
to sign a piece of paper to authorise the transaction - I'm happy with
this. In addition, I was also asked to confirm my date of birth and my
home postcode. (Just as a simple challenge, these are two data about me
that everyone on this list should quite trivially be able to find out).
Given the discussion, I commented that they weren't particularly secure
questions, so why bother asking them.  Apparently it's because my name
wasn't printed on the credit card bill. (HSBC have started printing it
in two sheets).
It didn't occur to her that she could quite easily have asked to see the
piece of plastic which is my credit card, which has the same numbers as
on the sheets, and my name. When I showed her that, she said "well, we
don't take credit cards as identification", and I pointed to the numbers
on the bill. I then got told that this only happened because the transaction
was between 500 and 1000 pounds. If it had been more, I would have needed
to show them a driving licence or passport (I don't drive, and I do now
have a passport, but there were several weeks where I was getting it
replaced recently - what if I'd needed to pay a large amount in, or if I'd
forgotten about it).
They also only bothered to tell me about this when I went there. I don't
routinely carry photo-ID and given the speed with which they processed the
queue, and the questions they asked. I suspect I'd have had a fairly major
I'm not so sure about this.
Very much so!

@_subject: NPR : E-Mail Encryption Rare in Everyday Use 
Very few people I knew at the time moved to SSH because it was "more
secure" and because "passwords weren't in plaintext". Most of the
people moved because of the things you could do with SSH above and
beyond telnet (port forwarding, X11 forwarding etc). In fact, the
latter is the main reason I moved - it dated before i started taking
an interest in security. Not to say that there weren't *any* who had
the security reasons for moving, but then kerberized telnet existed
too at that point in time.
