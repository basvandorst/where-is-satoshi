@_subject: Transcript of David Friedman's Will Encryption Protect 
It wasn't "someone" who said that the move toward civilization coincided with the move toward privacy. It was Ayn Rand. And the quote is as follows:
"Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy. The savage's whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe. Civilization is the process of setting man free from men." - Ayn Rand, 1943.
I used this quote as the opening of my December 1996 Forbes ASAP invited article called "History's Greatest Brain Drain" which you can still find at:
even though it seems to be gone from the Forbes web site.
All the best,
