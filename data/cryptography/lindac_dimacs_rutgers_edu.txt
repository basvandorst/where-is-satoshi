     DIMACS Workshop on Large-Scale Internet Attacks
     September 23 - 24, 2003
     DIMACS Center, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ
Organizers:    Vern Paxson, ICSI, vern at icir.org
   Steve Bellovin, AT&T Research, smb at research.att.com
   Stuart Staniford, Silicon Defense    Stefan Savage, University of California,  savage at cs.ucsd.edu Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Communication
Security and Information Privacy.
    ************************************************
As the Internet has grown greatly in size, new forms of attacks that
leverage the network's increasing scale have gained prominence.  At the
same time, the network's scale also often increases the difficulty of
countering attacks, making it more difficult to trace back attackers or
deploy widespread defensive measures.  This workshop aims to assess the
lay of the land in terms of large-scale Internet attacks and then to look
for principles common to the problem domain.  The focus will be on three
general types of large-scale attacks: distributed denial-of-service (DDOS),
self-propagating malicious code (worms), and attacks targetting the
network's components (infrastructure attacks).
Participation in the workshop is quite limited because of the emphasis on
achieving a high degree of interactivity & discussion.  Potential attendees
interested in participating should contact the organization chair at
vern at icir.org, including a description of relevant background and the
specific topic(s) of interest for discussion & exploration.

Workshop Program:
Preliminary Program for DIMACS Workshop on Large-Scale Attacks
IMPORTANT: the workshop is meant to be a true workshop, in which the
actual program is fluid, and the emphasis is on interactivity and
incubating new connections (both between people and across areas). We
anticipate last-minute changes, and indeed may alter the program on
the spot as discussion and opportunity suggests.

DIMACS/PORTIA Workshop on Privacy-Preserving Data Mining
     March 15 - 16, 2004
     DIMACS Center, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ
Organizers:    Cynthia Dwork, Microsoft, dwork at microsoft.com     Benny Pinkas, HP Labs, benny.pinkas at hp.com     Rebecca Wright, Stevens Institute of Technology,             rwright at cs.stevens-tech.edu Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Communication
Security and Information Privacy, and the PORTIA project.
    ************************************************
This workshop and working group will bring together researchers and
practitioners in cryptography, data mining, and other areas to discuss
privacy-preserving data mining. The workshop sessions on March 15 and
16, 2004 will consist of invited talks and discussion. March 17, 2004
will be a "working group" of invited participants to identify and
explore approaches that could serve as the basis for more
sophisticated algorithms and implementations than presently exist, and
to discuss directions for further research and collaboration.
Both the workshop and working group will investigate the construction
and exploitation of "private" databases, e.g.
 * Merging information from multiple data sets in a consistent,
   secure, efficient and privacy-preserving manner;
 * Sanitizing databases to permit privacy-preserving public study.
In a wide variety of applications it would be useful to be able to
gather information from several different data sets. The owners of
these data sets may not be willing, or legally able, to share their
complete data with each other. The ability to collaborate without
revealing information could be instrumental in fostering inter-agency
Particular topics of interest include:
    * Secure multi-party computation. This is a very general and       well-studied paradigm that unfortunately has not been used in
      practice so far. We will investigate ways to make it more
      efficient and encourage its deployment.
    * Statistical techniques such as data swapping,
      post-randomization, and perturbation.
    * Articulation of different notions and aspects of privacy.
    * Tradeoffs between privacy and accuracy.
    * Architectures that facilitate private queries by a
      (semi-trusted) third party.
    * Methods for handling different or incompatible formats,       and erroneous data. We will investigate ideas from dimension       reduction, clustering and searching strategy.

SPECIAL FOCUS ON COMMUNICATION SECURITY AND INFORMATION PRIVACY:
                             2003 - 2006
Vitally important aspects of our modern society have become dependent
on rapid and secure communication, which is increasingly
electronic. The new electronic age offers vast potential for new
services and applications, but gives rise to serious new
vulnerabilities and security threats. Moreover, many of the most
important new applications come at the price of threats to privacy. We
plan a 3-year ``special focus'' on Communication Security and
Information Privacy, beginning in summer 2003, that will explore the
new vulnerabilities and threats and new methods for dealing with them.
Within the last decade a tremendous transition has taken place in
communications networks. Previously, nearly all communication, whether
data, voice or other media, was carried over private networks. Anyone
who was not a customer of the network provider was not given physical
access to the network. Securing such networks was relatively
straightforward. While a great deal of data and media traffic still
run over circuit switched or packet switched ATM or Frame Relay
private networks, a huge amount and variety of data and media traffic
now run over the public Internet, so much so that Internet is now an
important national infrastructure whose integrity is vital to the
functioning of our economy, culture, and government. The migration of
communication services to the Internet is still very much in
progress. This migration brings with it new and complex challenges for
maintaining communication security.
There are many factors driving the migration to the Internet. One is
universal connectivity. The Internet protocol allows users with many
different types of local area network technologies (e.g., Ethernet,
and 802.11) to be integrated into a single large network. This allows
for a type of positive feedback often referred to as the ``network
effect.'' The network grows quickly because the number of users,
servers, and devices that are already reachable on the Internet make
it very valuable to any new IP device. A second factor is
unification. Unlike the circuit switched world for which signaling and
data/media were carried by two separate networks, signaling and
data/media can both be carried over the Internet. For network
providers, migrating their services onto an Internet backbone means
that they need only deploy, manage, and control a single network,
thereby reducing their cost of providing services. Finally, the
ultimate promise of the Internet is as a platform for integrating a
variety of services such as voice, instant messaging, mobile presence,
multimedia, Web and data services. While these are powerful factors
driving the migration to IP communications, they have serious security
repercussions. Indeed, securing an extremely large, shared services,
packet-based IP network with a large number of administrative domains
is a much more complex task than securing segregated/circuit switched
Furthermore, through the collection and dissemination of vast amounts
of data, the Internet allows users to take advantage of new
functionalities that inherently require new notions of security. For
example, new issues of privacy for Internet users and applications are
arising due to the multitude of data available online. This new
electronic reality and the vast potential for interaction between
users and computers give rise to new digital applications and services
once thought possibly only in the physical tangible world. This, in
turn, creates the need for the invention and implementation of new
security and cryptographic techniques. Enabling secure electronic
commerce and securing digital rights management are some central
examples of the new challenges faced in the security area.
Some of the most exciting progress in the fields of communication
security and information privacy has come because of the
interconections of practitioners in these fields with researchers
developing relevant methods of theoretical computer science and
mathematics. This project will explore these interconnections in order
to address some of the fundamental challenges to communication
security and information privacy posed by the rapid transition and
remarkable growth of new applications in today's communication
networks. The project will be carried out in the context of a
three-year ``special focus" at DIMACS, the Center for Discrete
Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science. The project will be
centered around workshops and research ``working groups,'' with a
tutorial, visitor program, and graduate student program.
The Themes of the Special Focus Include:
    * Studying protocol and host vulnerabilities related to Internet
communication. Among them are the weakness or total lack of source
authentication for the base protocols in the IP suite, lack of
admission control mechanisms, vulnerability of hosts to implementation
and configuration errors. What is more, protocol and host
vulnerabilities can be exploited in tandem to create serious attacks
such as distributed denial of service attacks.
    * Securing the protocol layer. The special focus will analyze a
wide range of security issues related to newer technologies such as
wireless access at the lower layers of the protocol stack, or Web
services at the higher layer of the protocol stack, including issues
dealing with ad-hoc trust establishment, secure roaming between
overlay networks, the controlled execution of untrusted code, and
peer-to-peer connection in pervasive networking scenarios.
    * Seamless data movement vs. privacy and property rights. The
power of service providers to automatically log and analyzinformation
on site visitors or customers for collection and dissemination is so
great that it must be properly managed or else there is a significant
potential for abuse. The special focus will examine both violation of
property rights and violation of privacy both in the general context
and in more specialized applications such as health care data and
electronic voting.
   * Cryptography and secure protocols. As technology evolves,
cryptogrtaphy faces the task of developing new security models and
techniques such as developing a complete suite of solutions that can
handle the concurrency and asynchrony of the Internet and obtaining
information from multiple data sets while protecting privacy and
Opportunities to Participate: The Special Focus will include:

Security and Information Privacy.
    ************************************************
As the Internet has grown greatly in size, new forms of attacks that
leverage the network's increasing scale have gained prominence.  At the
same time, the network's scale also often increases the difficulty of
countering attacks, making it more difficult to trace back attackers or
deploy widespread defensive measures.  This workshop aims to assess the
lay of the land in terms of large-scale Internet attacks and then to look
for principles common to the problem domain.  The focus will be on three
general types of large-scale attacks: distributed denial-of-service (DDOS),
self-propagating malicious code (worms), and attacks targetting the
network's components (infrastructure attacks).
Participation in the workshop is quite limited because of the emphasis on
achieving a high degree of interactivity & discussion.  Potential attendees
interested in participating should contact the organization chair at
vern at icir.org, including a description of relevant background and the
specific topic(s) of interest for discussion & exploration.

Workshop Program:
Preliminary Program for DIMACS Workshop on Large-Scale Attacks
IMPORTANT: the workshop is meant to be a true workshop, in which the
actual program is fluid, and the emphasis is on interactivity and
incubating new connections (both between people and across areas). We
anticipate last-minute changes, and indeed may alter the program on
the spot as discussion and opportunity suggests.

DIMACS Tutorial on Social Choice and Computer Science
     May 10 - 14, 2004
     DIMACS Center, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ
Organizers:       Kevin Chang, University of Illinois, kcchang at cs.uiuc.edu        Michel Regenwetter, University of Illinois, regenwet at uiuc.edu Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Computation and
the Socio-Economic Sciences.
    ************************************************
The theory of social choice and voting has had a long history in the
social sciences, dating back to early work of Condorcet and others in
the 18th century. Some modern issues facing the theory of social
choice relate heavily to computer science. Often we need to determine
preferences for an individual or group, while maintaining accuracy,
fairness and security, sometimes with only limited information and/or
computational power. This tutorial will consider computer science and
social science issues in insuring the best choices given limited
information and computation. It will build on early work on
computational complexity of computing the winner of an election in. Moreover, we are also seeing voting/social choice
issues arising in strictly computer science applications such as
database and information retrieval, Internet search and meta-search,
and collaborative filtering. The tutorial will also consider such
applications. The tutorial will present an introduction to the
concepts and models of individual preference or utility as well as
social choice theory and introduce participants to a variety of modern
computational issues and computer science applications.
The following is a tentative list of topics:
  * Introduction to Voting Theory: History and Procedures.   * Computational Complexity of Social Choice Procedures.   * Mathematical Representations of Preference and Utility.   * Ranking and Preference in Computer Science: Models and Semantics.   * Rank-based Top-k Query Algorithms in Database Search.   * Voting and Security: An introduction to the use of
    error-resilient, waitless methods of voting analysis.   * Collaborative Filtering in Information Retrieval.   * Internet Search and Meta-Search.
  * Behavioral Social Choice Theory.   * Voting over the Internet.
Talks for this workshop are by invitation only.

DIMACS Workshop on Electronic Voting -- Theory and Practice

Organizers:    Markus Jakobsson, RSA Laboratories, mjakobsson at rsasecurity.com     Ari Juels, RSA Laboratories, ajuels at rsasecurity.com Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Communication
Security and Information Privacy and the Special Focus on Computation and the Socio-Economic Sciences..
    ************************************************
To many technologists, electronic voting represents a seemingly simple
exercise in system design. In reality, the many requirements it
imposes with regard to correctness, anonymity, and availability pose
an unusually thorny collection of problems, and the security risks
associated with electronic voting, especially remotely over the
Internet, are numerous and complex, posing major technological
challenges for computer scientists. (For a few examples, see
references below.) The problems range from the threat of
denial-of-service-attacks to the need for careful selection of
techniques to enforce private and correct tallying of ballots. Other
possible requirements for electronic voting schemes are resistance to
vote buying, defenses against malfunctioning software, viruses, and
related problems, audit ability, and the development of user-friendly
and universally accessible interfaces.
The goal of the workshop is to bring together and foster an interplay
of ideas among researchers and practitioners in different areas of
relevance to voting. For example, the workshop will investigate
prevention of penetration attacks that involve the use of a delivery
mechanism to transport a malicious payload to the target host. This
could be in the form of a ``Trojan horse'' or remote control
program. It will also investigate vulnerabilities of the communication
path between the voting client (the devices where a voter votes) and
the server (where votes are tallied). Especially in the case of remote
voting, the path must be ``trusted'' and a challenge is to maintain an
authenticated communications linkage. Although not specifically a
security issue, reliability issues are closely related and will also
be considered. The workshop will consider issues dealing with random
hardware and software failures (as opposed to deliberate, intelligent
attack). A key difference between voting and electronic commerce is
that in the former, one wants to irreversibly sever the link between
the ballot and the voter. The workshop will discuss audit trails as a
way of ensuring this. The workshop will also investigate methods for
minimizing coercion and fraud, e.g., schemes to allow a voter to vote
more than once and only having the last vote count.
This workshop is part of the Special Focus on Communication Security
and Information Privacy and will be coordinated with the Special Focus
on Computation and the Socio-Economic Sciences.
This workshop follows a successful first WOTE event, organized by
David Chaum and Ron Rivest in 2001 at Marconi Conference Center in
Tomales Bay, California ( Since
that time, a flurry of voting bills has been enacted at the federal
and state levels, including most notably the Help America Vote Act
(HAVA). Standards development has represented another avenue of reform
(e.g., the IEEE Voting Equipment Standards Project 1583), while a
grassroots movement ( has arisen to
promote the importance of audit trails as enhancements to

DIMACS Workshop on Mobile and Wireless Security      June 15 - 17 , 2004

Organizers:       Bill Arbaugh, University of Maryland, waa at cs.umd.edu Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Communication
Security and Information Privacy.
    ************************************************
The rapid growth of both voice and data wireless communications has
resulted in several serious security problems in both the voice and data spaces. Unfortunately, many of the early security mistakes made with wireless voice communications were repeated with data
communications, i.e. the use of flawed authentication and
confidentiality algorithms. For example, the standards committee for 802.11 left many of the difficult security issues such as key
management and a robust authentication mechanism as open problems. This has led many organizations to use either a permanent fixed
cryptographic variable or no encryption with their wireless networks. Since wireless networks provide an adversary a network access point
that is beyond the physical security controls of the organization, security can be a problem. Similarly, attacks against WEP, the
link-layer security protocol for 802.11 networks can exploit design failures to successfully attack such networks. This workshop will focus on addressing the many outstanding issues that remain in
wireless cellular and WLAN networking such as (but not limited to):
Management and monitoring; ad-hoc trust establishment; secure roaming
between overlay networks; availability and denial of service
mitigation; and network and link layer security protocols. We will seek to extend work on ad hoc networking from a non-adversarial
setting, assuming a trusted environment, to a more realistic setting
in which an adversary may attempt to disrupt communication. We will
investigate a variety of approaches to securing ad hoc networks, in particular ways to take advantage of their inherent redundancy (multiple routes between nodes), replication, and new cryptographic schemes such as threshold cryptography.

    ************************************************ The analysis of cryptographic protocols is a fundamental and
challenging area of network security research. Traditionally, there
have been two main approaches. One is the logic approach aimed at
developing automated tools for the formal verification of
protocols. The other is the computational or complexity-theoretic
approach that characterizes protocol security as a set of
computational tasks and proves protocol security via reduction to the
strength of the underlying cryptographic functions. Although these two
lines of work share a common goal, there has been little commonality
between them until the last year or two.
The goal of this workshop is to promote work on security analysis of
protocols and provide a forum for cooperative research combining the
logical and complexity-based approaches.
The workshop will include tutorials on the basics of each approach and
will allow researchers from both communities to talk about their
current work.
Several tutorials and a number of research talks have already been
selected. However, some additional program slots have been set aside
for late-breaking Contributions from interested participants. If you
are interested in giving a talk, please send a title and short
abstract (1-3 pages) to the organizers, Ran Canetti and John Mitchell,
with subject heading "DIMACS Security Protocols - title and abstract,"

    ************************************************
The rapid growth of both voice and data wireless communications has
resulted in several serious security problems in both the voice and data spaces. Unfortunately, many of the early security mistakes made with wireless voice communications were repeated with data
communications, i.e. the use of flawed authentication and
confidentiality algorithms. For example, the standards committee for 802.11 left many of the difficult security issues such as key
management and a robust authentication mechanism as open problems. This has led many organizations to use either a permanent fixed
cryptographic variable or no encryption with their wireless networks. Since wireless networks provide an adversary a network access point
that is beyond the physical security controls of the organization, security can be a problem. Similarly, attacks against WEP, the
link-layer security protocol for 802.11 networks can exploit design failures to successfully attack such networks. This workshop will focus on addressing the many outstanding issues that remain in
wireless cellular and WLAN networking such as (but not limited to):
Management and monitoring; ad-hoc trust establishment; secure roaming
between overlay networks; availability and denial of service
mitigation; and network and link layer security protocols. We will seek to extend work on ad hoc networking from a non-adversarial
setting, assuming a trusted environment, to a more realistic setting
in which an adversary may attempt to disrupt communication. We will
investigate a variety of approaches to securing ad hoc networks, in particular ways to take advantage of their inherent redundancy (multiple routes between nodes), replication, and new cryptographic schemes such as threshold cryptography.

    ************************************************ Recent advances in information technology and its rapid acceptance by
the business community have allowed for the possibility of expediting
complex business transactions. The most prominent example is use of
auctions in corporate procurement and in government deregulation
efforts. When many items with interrelated values are being sold,
economic efficiency can be increased by allowing bidders to make bids
on combinations of items. Procedures for auctioning combinations of
items have inherent computational problems that have to be overcome,
and the emergence of these issues has sparked considerable research
activity in the computer science and combinatorial optimization
communities. The most prominent example is combinatorial auctions in
which multiple goods are auctioned and bidders have and wish to
express different valuations on which goods complement each other and
which goods substitute for each other.

Organizer:       Brian LaMacchia, Microsoft, bal at microsoft.com Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Communication
Security and Information Privacy.
    ************************************************
 The growth of Web Services, and in particular electronic commerce
activities based on them, is quickly being followed by work on Web
Services security protocols. While core XML security standards like
XMLDSIG, XMLENC and WS-Security have been completed, they only provide
the basic building blocks of authentication, integrity protection and
confidentiality for Web Services. Additional Web Services standards
and protocols are required to provide higher-order operations such as
trust management, delegation, and federation. At the same time, the
sharp rise in "phishing" attacks and other forms of on-line fraud
simply confirms that all our work on security protocols is for naught
if we cannot make it both possible and easy for the average user to
discover when a security property has failed during a
transaction. This workshop aims to explore these areas as well as
other current and future security and privacy challenges for Web
Services applications and e-commerce.
The workshop will be open to the public (no submission is necessary to
attend). If you'd like to give a presentation please send a title and
abstract to commerce2005 at farcaster.com by January 17, 2005. Submissions may describe ongoing or planned work related to the
security of Web Services and electronic commerce, or they may discuss
important research problems or propose a research agenda in this
area. Also, we intend this to be a participatory and interactive

    ************************************************
This workshop and working group will bring together researchers and
practitioners in cryptography, data mining, and other areas to discuss
privacy-preserving data mining. The workshop sessions on March 15 and
16, 2004 will consist of invited talks and discussion. March 17, 2004
will be a "working group" of invited participants to identify and
explore approaches that could serve as the basis for more
sophisticated algorithms and implementations than presently exist, and
to discuss directions for further research and collaboration.
Both the workshop and working group will investigate the construction
and exploitation of "private" databases, e.g.
 * Merging information from multiple data sets in a consistent,
   secure, efficient and privacy-preserving manner;
 * Sanitizing databases to permit privacy-preserving public study.
In a wide variety of applications it would be useful to be able to
gather information from several different data sets. The owners of
these data sets may not be willing, or legally able, to share their
complete data with each other. The ability to collaborate without
revealing information could be instrumental in fostering inter-agency
Particular topics of interest include:
    * Secure multi-party computation. This is a very general and       well-studied paradigm that unfortunately has not been used in
      practice so far. We will investigate ways to make it more
      efficient and encourage its deployment.
    * Statistical techniques such as data swapping,
      post-randomization, and perturbation.
    * Articulation of different notions and aspects of privacy.
    * Tradeoffs between privacy and accuracy.
    * Architectures that facilitate private queries by a
      (semi-trusted) third party.
    * Methods for handling different or incompatible formats,       and erroneous data. We will investigate ideas from dimension       reduction, clustering and searching strategy.
Participation in the workshop (March 15 and 16, 2004) is open to
anyone who registers (no submission necessary but registration is
required). Participation in the working group on March 17, 2004 is
limited, and by invitation only, because of the emphasis on achieving
a high degree of interactivity and discussion. Workshop participants
who are interested in participating in the working group session
should send a 1-page abstract or position paper describing their work
relevant to this workshop to dimacs-wg at cs.stevens-tech.edu. All
submissions must be received by February 8, 2004 and authors will be
notified by February 15, 2004 as to whether they have been accepted to
participate in the working group. In addition, the authors of some
submissions may be invited to present short talks about their
work. Submissions may describe ongoing or planned work related to the
area of the working group, or they may discuss important research
problems or propose a research agenda in this area.

DIMACS Workshop on Electronic Voting -- Theory and Practice
   May 26 - 27, 2004    DIMACS Center, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ
Organizers:    Markus Jakobsson, RSA Laboratories, mjakobsson at rsasecurity.com     Ari Juels, RSA Laboratories, ajuels at rsasecurity.com Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Communication
Security and Information Privacy and the Special Focus on Computation and the Socio-Economic Sciences..
    ************************************************
To many technologists, electronic voting represents a seemingly simple
exercise in system design. In reality, the many requirements it
imposes with regard to correctness, anonymity, and availability pose
an unusually thorny collection of problems, and the security risks
associated with electronic voting, especially remotely over the
Internet, are numerous and complex, posing major technological
challenges for computer scientists. (For a few examples, see
references below.) The problems range from the threat of
denial-of-service-attacks to the need for careful selection of
techniques to enforce private and correct tallying of ballots. Other
possible requirements for electronic voting schemes are resistance to
vote buying, defenses against malfunctioning software, viruses, and
related problems, audit ability, and the development of user-friendly
and universally accessible interfaces.
The goal of the workshop is to bring together and foster an interplay
of ideas among researchers and practitioners in different areas of
relevance to voting. For example, the workshop will investigate
prevention of penetration attacks that involve the use of a delivery
mechanism to transport a malicious payload to the target host. This
could be in the form of a ``Trojan horse'' or remote control
program. It will also investigate vulnerabilities of the communication
path between the voting client (the devices where a voter votes) and
the server (where votes are tallied). Especially in the case of remote
voting, the path must be ``trusted'' and a challenge is to maintain an
authenticated communications linkage. Although not specifically a
security issue, reliability issues are closely related and will also
be considered. The workshop will consider issues dealing with random
hardware and software failures (as opposed to deliberate, intelligent
attack). A key difference between voting and electronic commerce is
that in the former, one wants to irreversibly sever the link between
the ballot and the voter. The workshop will discuss audit trails as a
way of ensuring this. The workshop will also investigate methods for
minimizing coercion and fraud, e.g., schemes to allow a voter to vote
more than once and only having the last vote count.
This workshop is part of the Special Focus on Communication Security
and Information Privacy and will be coordinated with the Special Focus
on Computation and the Socio-Economic Sciences.
This workshop follows a successful first WOTE event, organized by
David Chaum and Ron Rivest in 2001 at Marconi Conference Center in
Tomales Bay, California ( Since
that time, a flurry of voting bills has been enacted at the federal
and state levels, including most notably the Help America Vote Act
(HAVA). Standards development has represented another avenue of reform
(e.g., the IEEE Voting Equipment Standards Project 1583), while a
grassroots movement ( has arisen to
promote the importance of audit trails as enhancements to

    ************************************************
The rapid growth of both voice and data wireless communications has
resulted in several serious security problems in both the voice and data spaces. Unfortunately, many of the early security mistakes made with wireless voice communications were repeated with data
communications, i.e. the use of flawed authentication and
confidentiality algorithms. For example, the standards committee for 802.11 left many of the difficult security issues such as key
management and a robust authentication mechanism as open problems. This has led many organizations to use either a permanent fixed
cryptographic variable or no encryption with their wireless networks. Since wireless networks provide an adversary a network access point
that is beyond the physical security controls of the organization, security can be a problem. Similarly, attacks against WEP, the
link-layer security protocol for 802.11 networks can exploit design failures to successfully attack such networks. This workshop will focus on addressing the many outstanding issues that remain in
wireless cellular and WLAN networking such as (but not limited to):
Management and monitoring; ad-hoc trust establishment; secure roaming
between overlay networks; availability and denial of service
mitigation; and network and link layer security protocols. We will seek to extend work on ad hoc networking from a non-adversarial
setting, assuming a trusted environment, to a more realistic setting
in which an adversary may attempt to disrupt communication. We will
investigate a variety of approaches to securing ad hoc networks, in particular ways to take advantage of their inherent redundancy (multiple routes between nodes), replication, and new cryptographic schemes such as threshold cryptography.

DIMACS Workshop on Bounded Rationality
     January 31 - February 1, 2005
     DIMACS Center, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ
Organizers:      Lance Fortnow, University of Chicago, fortnow at cs.uchicago.edu      Richard McLean, Rutgers University, rpmclean at rci.rutgers.edu      Daijiro Okada, Rutgers University, okada at econ.rutgers.edu Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Computation and
the Socio-Economic Sciences.
    ************************************************ Traditionally, economists and game theorists have assumed that
strategic agents are fully rational in the sense that all players can
completely reason about the consequences of their actions. In the last
few decades, a number of game theorists have argued, in part motivated
by experimental results, that human players do not behave in a way
consistent with theoretical predictions. Questions have been raised
regarding the postulate of full rationality and some have attempted
formalization of partially or boundedly rational players and games
played by such players. This research falls under the rubric of
bounded rationality.
If one takes the view that a process of decision making in economic or
other social situations constitutes a computation in a formal sense of
theoretical computer science, then one is naturally led to some notion
of bounded computational power as a formal expression of bounded
rationality. Two important and complementary questions in this line of
inquiry are: (1) What is the computational power required in order to
play a game in a way consistent with full rationality? (2) If players
are limited in their computational power, how different will
equilibrium outcomes be from the fully rational case? With regard to
the first question, some researchers have examined the computational
complexity of finding best responses in games. As to the second
question, a number of researchers have focused on repeated games
played by various types of computing machines with an emphasis on
their role in facilitating cooperative behavior. In one branch of this
work, bounded rationality is interpreted as bounded recall where a
player's strategic options are limited by constraints that are placed
on memories of past actions. A larger literature models bounded
rationality in terms of finite automata. In particular, the strategies
of players are limited to those that are implementable by finite state
automata. Further work that studies strategies implementable by Turing
machines may be found. Most of the aforementioned work has been
carried out by game theorists and, with the exception of a short burst
of activity in the mid-1990's, there has not been a significant amount
of activity in bounded rationality from the computer science point of
view. This workshop will bring together economists and game theorists
interested in bounded rationality, as well as theoretical computer
scientists with experience in limited computational models. It will
explore previous interactions between computer scientists and
economists concerning this topic. It will then address such issues as:
What are the desiderata of a model of bounded rationality? How do
models of bounded rationality affect conclusions of standard models?
What aspects of human behavior have no compelling model of bounded
rationality to explain them? Are there computational models that
properly estimate the computational power of bounded players while
allowing for an analysis that yields useful results?

DIMACS Workshop on Security Analysis of Protocols

Organizers:   John Mitchell, Stanford, mitchell at cs.stanford.edu   Ran Canetti, IBM Watson, canetti at watson.ibm.com Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Communication
Security and Information Privacy.
    ************************************************ The analysis of cryptographic protocols is a fundamental and
challenging area of network security research. Traditionally, there
have been two main approaches, the logic approach aimed at developing
(automated) tools for the formal veri.cation of protocols and the
complexity theory approach that characterizes protocol security as a
set of computational tasks and proves protocol security via reduction
to the strength of the underlying cryptographic functions. Although
these two lines of work share a common goal, there has been little
commonality between them.
The goal of this workshop is to generally promote work on security
analysis of protocols and foster cooperative research combining the
logical and complexity-based approaches. The workshop will include
tutorials on the basics of each approach and will allow
representatives from both communities to talk about their current
    * - Analysis methods involving computational complexity
    * - Game-theoretic approaches
    * - Methods based on logic and symbolic computation
    * - Probabilistic methods

DIMACS Workshop on Security Analysis of Protocols
 June 7 - 9, 2004
 DIMACS Center, CoRE Building, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ

Security and Information Privacy.
    ************************************************ The analysis of cryptographic protocols is a fundamental and
challenging area of network security research. Traditionally, there
have been two main approaches. One is the logic approach aimed at
developing automated tools for the formal verification of
protocols. The other is the computational or complexity-theoretic
approach that characterizes protocol security as a set of
computational tasks and proves protocol security via reduction to the
strength of the underlying cryptographic functions. Although these two
lines of work share a common goal, there has been little commonality
between them until the last year or two.
The goal of this workshop is to promote work on security analysis of
protocols and provide a forum for cooperative research combining the
logical and complexity-based approaches.
The workshop will include tutorials on the basics of each approach and
will allow researchers from both communities to talk about their
current work.
Several tutorials and a number of research talks have already been
selected. However, some additional program slots have been set aside
for late-breaking Contributions from interested participants. If you
are interested in giving a talk, please send a title and short
abstract (1-3 pages) to the organizers, Ran Canetti and John Mitchell,
with subject heading "DIMACS Security Protocols - title and abstract,"
by May 15, 2004.

DIMACS Workshop on Electronic Voting -- Theory and Practice
   May 26 - 27, 2004    DIMACS Center, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ
Organizers:    Markus Jakobsson, RSA Laboratories, mjakobsson at rsasecurity.com     Ari Juels, RSA Laboratories, ajuels at rsasecurity.com Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Communication
Security and Information Privacy and the Special Focus on Computation and the Socio-Economic Sciences..
    ************************************************
To many technologists, electronic voting represents a seemingly simple
exercise in system design. In reality, the many requirements it
imposes with regard to correctness, anonymity, and availability pose
an unusually thorny collection of problems, and the security risks
associated with electronic voting, especially remotely over the
Internet, are numerous and complex, posing major technological
challenges for computer scientists. (For a few examples, see
references below.) The problems range from the threat of
denial-of-service-attacks to the need for careful selection of
techniques to enforce private and correct tallying of ballots. Other
possible requirements for electronic voting schemes are resistance to
vote buying, defenses against malfunctioning software, viruses, and
related problems, audit ability, and the development of user-friendly
and universally accessible interfaces.
The goal of the workshop is to bring together and foster an interplay
of ideas among researchers and practitioners in different areas of
relevance to voting. For example, the workshop will investigate
prevention of penetration attacks that involve the use of a delivery
mechanism to transport a malicious payload to the target host. This
could be in the form of a ``Trojan horse'' or remote control
program. It will also investigate vulnerabilities of the communication
path between the voting client (the devices where a voter votes) and
the server (where votes are tallied). Especially in the case of remote
voting, the path must be ``trusted'' and a challenge is to maintain an
authenticated communications linkage. Although not specifically a
security issue, reliability issues are closely related and will also
be considered. The workshop will consider issues dealing with random
hardware and software failures (as opposed to deliberate, intelligent
attack). A key difference between voting and electronic commerce is
that in the former, one wants to irreversibly sever the link between
the ballot and the voter. The workshop will discuss audit trails as a
way of ensuring this. The workshop will also investigate methods for
minimizing coercion and fraud, e.g., schemes to allow a voter to vote
more than once and only having the last vote count.
This workshop is part of the Special Focus on Communication Security
and Information Privacy and will be coordinated with the Special Focus
on Computation and the Socio-Economic Sciences.
This workshop follows a successful first WOTE event, organized by
David Chaum and Ron Rivest in 2001 at Marconi Conference Center in
Tomales Bay, California ( Since
that time, a flurry of voting bills has been enacted at the federal
and state levels, including most notably the Help America Vote Act
(HAVA). Standards development has represented another avenue of reform
(e.g., the IEEE Voting Equipment Standards Project 1583), while a
grassroots movement ( has arisen to
promote the importance of audit trails as enhancements to
This is a preliminary program.

DIMACS Workshop on Bounded Rationality
     January 31 - February 1, 2005
     DIMACS Center, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ
Organizers:      Lance Fortnow, University of Chicago, fortnow at cs.uchicago.edu      Richard McLean, Rutgers University, rpmclean at rci.rutgers.edu      Daijiro Okada, Rutgers University, okada at econ.rutgers.edu Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Computation and
the Socio-Economic Sciences.
    ************************************************ Traditionally, economists and game theorists have assumed that
strategic agents are fully rational but in the last few decades a
number of game theorists have argued that human players do not behave
in a way consistent with theoretical predictions. Questions have been
raised regarding the postulate of full rationality and some have
proposed formalizations of partially or boundedly rational players and
games played by such players. If one takes the view that a process of
decision-making in economic or other social situations constitutes
computation in a formal sense of theoretical computer science, then
one is naturally led to some notion of bounded computational power as
a formal expression of bounded rationality. Two important and
complementary questions in this line of inquiry are (1) What is the
computational power required in order to play a game in a way
consistent with full rationality? (2) If players are limited in their
computational power, how different will equilibrium outcomes be from
the fully rational case? This workshop will bring together economists
and game theorists interested in bounded rationality, as well as
theoretical computer scientists with experience in limited
computational models.
Topics of interest include:
    * Bounded recall and bounded complexity in repeated games
    * Strategic aspects of machine learning
    * Game theoretic applications of cryptography Call for Participation:
The organizers invite interested speakers to submit titles and
abstracts. Please e-mail the title and abstract to one of the
organizers (fortnow at cs.uchicago.edu, rpmclean at rci.rutgers.edu, or

DIMACS Workshop on Markets as Predictive Devices (Information Markets)
     February 2-4, 2005
     DIMACS Center, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ
Organizers:      Robin Hanson, George Mason University, rhanson at gmu.edu      John Ledyard, California Institute of Technology,
       jledyard at hss.caltech.edu      David Pennock, Overture Services, David.Pennock at overture.com Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Computation and
the Socio-Economic Sciences.
    ************************************************ For decades, economists have studied an astonishing "side effect''
of financial and wagering markets: their ability to serve as highly
accurate forecasting devices. This workshop aims to explore the use of
markets as a substitute for, or complement to, more traditional
forecasting tools. We will examine how information flows from traders
to the market and back again, how market mechanisms process
information, how market prices communicate information and forecasts,
and what mechanisms best foster accurate and statistically-testable
predictions. The workshop will bring together researchers and
practitioners from a variety of relevant fields, including economics,
finance, computer science, and statistics, in both academia and
industry, to discuss the state of the art today, and the challenges
and prospects for tomorrow.
A market designed from the outset for information gathering and
forecasting is called an information market. Information markets can
be used to elicit a collective estimate of the expected value or
probability of a random variable, reflecting information dispersed
across an entire population of traders. The market prediction is not
usually an average or median of individual opinions, but is a complex
summarization reflecting the game-theoretic interplay of traders as
they obtain and leverage information, and as they react to the actions
of others obtaining and leveraging their own information, etc. In the
best case scenario, the market price reflects a forecast that is a
perfect Bayesian integration of all the information spread across all
of the traders, properly accounting even for redundancy. This is the
equilibrium scenario called rational expectations in the economics
literature, and is the assumption underlying the strong form of the
efficient markets hypothesis in finance.
The degree to which market forecasts approach optimality in
practice, or at least surpass other known methods of forecasting, is
remarkable. Supporting evidence can be found in empirical studies of
options markets, commodity futures markets, political stock markets,
sports betting markets, horse racing markets, market games, laboratory
investigations of experimental markets, and field tests. In nearly all
these cases, to the extent that the financial instruments or bets are
tied to real-world events, market prices reveal a reliable forecast
about the likely unfolding of those events, often beating expert
opinions or polls.
Despite a growing experimental literature, many questions remain
regarding how best to design, deploy, analyze, and understand
information markets, including both technical challenges (e.g.,
designing combinatorial exchanges and social challenges (e.g.,
overcoming legal and ethical concerns). The search for answers will
benefit from input from economists (including specialists in mechanism
design, experimental economics, financial markets, wagering markets,
and rational expectations theory), statisticians and decision
theorists (including experts in forecasting, belief aggregation, group
decision making, Bayesian updating, and opinion polling), and computer
scientists (including experts in combinatorial exchanges, distributed
computing, information theory, and mixing worst-case and Bayesian
analysis). This workshop will seek to bring together a variety of
experts representing these fields, to engage in a dialog describing
current and future research directions to facilitate the design,
refinement, and proliferation of markets as predictive devices.
As part of the workshop, one or more tutorials are planned for the
benefit of students and other newcomers to the field; little or no
background knowledge will be assumed.
Call for Participation:
This workshop will include talks on information markets (a.k.a,
prediction markets, event markets, or idea futures) by a number of
distinguished invited speakers. Speakers will cover a range of topics
including mechanism design, experiments, analysis, policy, and
industry experience. Speakers will include representatives from
academia, industry, and government. The workshop will feature research
talks, opinions, reports of industry experience, and discussion of
government policy from the perspective of a number of fields,
including economics, business, finance, computer science,
gambling/gaming, and policy. See the workshop program for more
The workshop will feature a tutorial session on Wednesday afternoon
(Feb. 2, 2005) to help those new to the field get up to speed. The
workshop will include a panel discussion on the Policy Analysis Market
(a.k.a., "Terror Futures") and a "rump" session where anyone who
requests time can have the floor for five minutes to speak on any
relevant topic. To participate in the rump session, please email David
Pennock at pennockd at yahoo-inc.com.

DIMACS Workshop on Mobile and Wireless Security      November 3 - 4, 2004
     DIMACS Center, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ
Organizers:       Bill Arbaugh, University of Maryland, waa at cs.umd.edu Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Communication
Security and Information Privacy.
    ************************************************
The rapid growth of both voice and data wireless communications has
resulted in several serious security problems in both the voice and data spaces. Unfortunately, many of the early security mistakes made with wireless voice communications were repeated with data
communications, i.e. the use of flawed authentication and
confidentiality algorithms. For example, the standards committee for 802.11 left many of the difficult security issues such as key
management and a robust authentication mechanism as open problems. This has led many organizations to use either a permanent fixed
cryptographic variable or no encryption with their wireless networks. Since wireless networks provide an adversary a network access point
that is beyond the physical security controls of the organization, security can be a problem. Similarly, attacks against WEP, the
link-layer security protocol for 802.11 networks can exploit design failures to successfully attack such networks. This workshop will focus on addressing the many outstanding issues that remain in
wireless cellular and WLAN networking such as (but not limited to):
Management and monitoring; ad-hoc trust establishment; secure roaming
between overlay networks; availability and denial of service
mitigation; and network and link layer security protocols. We will seek to extend work on ad hoc networking from a non-adversarial
setting, assuming a trusted environment, to a more realistic setting
in which an adversary may attempt to disrupt communication. We will
investigate a variety of approaches to securing ad hoc networks, in particular ways to take advantage of their inherent redundancy (multiple routes between nodes), replication, and new cryptographic schemes such as threshold cryptography.

    ************************************************ Recent advances in information technology and its rapid acceptance by
the business community have allowed for the possibility of expediting
complex business transactions. The most prominent example is use of
auctions in corporate procurement and in government deregulation
efforts. When many items with interrelated values are being sold,
economic efficiency can be increased by allowing bidders to make bids
on combinations of items. Procedures for auctioning combinations of
items have inherent computational problems that have to be overcome,
and the emergence of these issues has sparked considerable research
activity in the computer science and combinatorial optimization
communities. The most prominent example is combinatorial auctions in
which multiple goods are auctioned and bidders have and wish to
express different valuations on which goods complement each other and
which goods substitute for each other.

investigate a variety of approaches to securing ad hoc networks, in particular ways to take advantage of their inherent redundancy (multiple routes between nodes), replication, and new cryptographic schemes such as threshold cryptography.
Call for Participation:
Advances in wireless technology as well as several other areas are
changing the way the world does business and as a result computing is
becoming more mobile, and users are demanding continuous access to the
Internet. At the same time, the number of devices with embedded
networking technology is growing exponentially--from boxes with RFID
tags to Wi-Fi capable refrigerators since they destroy the notion of a
static defensive perimeter. Furthermore, these trends make the ease of
use and management of wireless based networks more important since
naive consumers in the future will be establishing and using wireless
networks on a scale significantly larger than today. This workshop
will focus on identifying the current and future problems in wireless
security and privacy and discuss possible solutions.
The three day workshop will be organized around a series of talks on
subjects related to mobility, wireless, and security and privacy
technologies. There will be a mix between invited talks and talks
selected from extended abstracts with plenty of discussion time
between talks.

Security and Information Privacy.
    ************************************************
 The growth of Web Services, and in particular electronic commerce
activities based on them, is quickly being followed by work on Web
Services security protocols. While core XML security standards like
XMLDSIG, XMLENC and WS-Security have been completed, they only provide
the basic building blocks of authentication, integrity protection and
confidentiality for Web Services. Additional Web Services standards
and protocols are required to provide higher-order operations such as
trust management, delegation, and federation. At the same time, the
sharp rise in "phishing" attacks and other forms of on-line fraud
simply confirms that all our work on security protocols is for naught
if we cannot make it both possible and easy for the average user to
discover when a security property has failed during a
transaction. This workshop aims to explore these areas as well as
other current and future security and privacy challenges for Web
Services applications and e-commerce.

Security and Information Privacy.
    ************************************************
On April 14-15, 2005, we will hold a DIMACS workshop at Rutgers University, NJ, on the topic of Theft in E-Commerce. This will include but not be limited to theft of content, of identity, and of service. While theft is an old problem, the automated nature of e-commerce introduces new opportunities for traditional forms of theft, as well as entirely new forms of theft.  The centrality of computation makes these threats a part of computer security.  This is an area of research where we are seeing a lot of activity, and where we believe there is a great potential for valuable research contributions. While our primary interest is in defenses against theft, we are also interested in novel attacks and real data about attacks, as the defenders need to know what to defend against. For more information about the workshop location, organization, and the program (once finalized), please see:
   We are soliciting contributions in these areas, for both long and short presentations (approx 30 minutes vs 10 minutes.) There are no proceedings, but we request that presentation material is submitted to the organizers at the time of the workshop, allowing it to be posted on the DIMACS webpage. In order to propose a talk, please contact one of the organizers, Markus Jakobsson (markus at indiana.edu) or Drew Dean (drew.dean at sri.com) with a title and a short abstract by February 28,
2005 that allows us to determine whether your proposed talk will fit within the scope of the workshop.
Please refer to the information on the webpage above for workshop registration, hotel reservation and travel information, and information on how to apply for financial support for those in need of this.

DIMACS Workshop on Information Markets
      February 2-4, 2005

Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Computation and
the Socio-Economic Sciences
A market designed for information gathering and forecasting is called
an information market. Information markets can be used to elicit a
collective estimate of the expected value or probability of a random
variable, reflecting information dispersed across a population of
traders. The degree to which market forecasts approach optimality in
practice, or at least surpass other known methods of forecasting, is
remarkable. Supporting evidence can be found in empirical studies of
options markets, commodity futures markets, political stock markets,
sports betting markets, horse racing markets, market games, laboratory
investigations of experimental markets, and field tests. In nearly all
these cases, market prices reveal a reliable forecast about the likely
unfolding of future events, often beating expert opinions or polls.
Despite a growing theoretical and experimental literature, many
questions remain regarding how best to design, deploy, analyze, and
understand information markets, including both technical challenges
and social challenges.
This workshop will include talks on information markets by a number of
distinguished invited speakers. Speakers will cover a range of topics
including mechanism design, experiments, analysis, policy, and
industry experience. Speakers will include representatives from
academia, industry, and government. The workshop will feature research
talks, opinions, reports of industry experience, and discussion of
government policy from the perspective of a number of fields,
including economics, business, finance, computer science,
gambling/gaming, and policy. See the workshop program for more
details: The workshop will feature a tutorial session on Wednesday afternoon
(Feb. 2, 2005) to help those new to the field get up to speed. The
workshop will include a panel discussion on the Policy Analysis Market
(a.k.a., "Terror Futures") and a "rump" session where anyone who
requests time can have the floor for five minutes to speak on any
relevant topic. To participate in the rump session, please email David

DIMACS Workshop on Bounded Rationality

Organizers:      Lance Fortnow, University of Chicago, fortnow at cs.uchicago.edu      Richard McLean, Rutgers University, rpmclean at rci.rutgers.edu      Daijiro Okada, Rutgers University, okada at econ.rutgers.edu Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Computation and
the Socio-Economic Sciences.
    ************************************************ Traditionally, economists and game theorists have assumed that
strategic agents are fully rational but in the last few decades a
number of game theorists have argued that human players do not behave
in a way consistent with theoretical predictions. Questions have been
raised regarding the postulate of full rationality and some have
proposed formalizations of partially or boundedly rational players and
games played by such players. If one takes the view that a process of
decision-making in economic or other social situations constitutes
computation in a formal sense of theoretical computer science, then
one is naturally led to some notion of bounded computational power as
a formal expression of bounded rationality. Two important and
complementary questions in this line of inquiry are (1) What is the
computational power required in order to play a game in a way
consistent with full rationality? (2) If players are limited in their
computational power, how different will equilibrium outcomes be from
the fully rational case? This workshop will bring together economists
and game theorists interested in bounded rationality, as well as
theoretical computer scientists with experience in limited
computational models.
Topics of interest include:
    * Bounded recall and bounded complexity in repeated games
    * Strategic aspects of machine learning
    * Game theoretic applications of cryptography This is a preliminary program.

***CFP DEADLINE EXTENDED to Friday, February 11, 2005***
DIMACS Workshop on Security of Web Services and E-Commerce
     May 5 - 6, 2005          DIMACS Center, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ
Organizer:       Brian LaMacchia, Microsoft, bal at microsoft.com Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Communication
Security and Information Privacy.
    ************************************************
 The growth of Web Services, and in particular electronic commerce
activities based on them, is quickly being followed by work on Web
Services security protocols. While core XML security standards like
XMLDSIG, XMLENC and WS-Security have been completed, they only provide
the basic building blocks of authentication, integrity protection and
confidentiality for Web Services. Additional Web Services standards
and protocols are required to provide higher-order operations such as
trust management, delegation, and federation. At the same time, the
sharp rise in "phishing" attacks and other forms of on-line fraud
simply confirms that all our work on security protocols is for naught
if we cannot make it both possible and easy for the average user to
discover when a security property has failed during a
transaction. This workshop aims to explore these areas as well as
other current and future security and privacy challenges for Web
Services applications and e-commerce.
The workshop will be open to the public (no submission is necessary to
attend but please register online). If you'd like to give a
presentation please send a title and abstract to:
 commerce2005 at farcaster.com by February 11, 2005. Submissions may describe ongoing or planned work related to the
security of Web Services and electronic commerce, or they may discuss
important research problems or propose a research agenda in this
area. Also, we intend this to be a participatory and interactive
meeting so we hope you will be able to contribute to the meeting even
without giving an announced talk.

This workshop is focusing on Theft in E-Commerce (of content, identity
and service). While theft is an old problem, the automated nature of
e-commerce introduces new opportunities for traditional forms of
theft, as well as entirely new forms of theft. The centrality of
computation makes these threats a part of computer security. This is
an area of research where we are seeing a lot of activity, and where
we believe there is a great potential for valuable research
contributions. While our primary interest is in defenses against
theft, we are also interested in novel attacks and real data about
attacks, as the defenders need to know what to defend against. It is
our hope that we could stimulate such research by bringing together
the leaders in this area, which is the very intention of this
Workshop Program:
This is a preliminary program subject to change.

The following message is being forwarded to you at the
request of Rebecca Wright.
     C A L L     F O R    P A R T I C I P A T I O N
     ---------------------------------------------------
We invite you to participate in the Third Annual Conference on Applied
Cryptography and Network Security (ACNS 2005). This international
conference features original research papers on scientific and
technical aspects of cryptology and network security and is the third
in its series. There are two tracks at ACNS: a research-oriented
papers track (that will appear as a Springer's LNCS proceedings
available at the conference) and an industrial/ short papers track
(that will appear as a pre-proceedings and will be available at the
conference as well). The latter has an emphasis on practical
applications. In addition, invited talks by leading experts in the
field, covering various recent developments, will be presented.
It has been quite a while since there was a major full conference
dedicated to cryptography and security in the New York City
Metropolitan Area (a kind of "NewYorCrypt"), and ACNS 2005 is just it!
It will enable an advanced forum on cryptography and security in the
setting of New York City in one of the best time of the year to be in
the the city. This setting should allow the local researchers,
students and industry community easy access to very current issues and
topics, and should attract international participants as well.
The details about the program, the committee, registration details and
additional information is available at:
     We believe that members of the scientific and technical industry
community who will participate will enjoy a high level scientific
event in the promising setting of NYC in June.

Trustworthy Interfaces for Passwords and Personal Information The following message is being forwarded at the request
of Burt Kaliski, RSA Security and Dan Boneh, Stanford University.
1st TIPPI Workshop
Trustworthy Interfaces for Passwords and Personal Information Sponsored by the PORTIA project
Location: Stanford University, Gates Computer Science Building, Room B12  Organizers:  Burt Kaliski, RSA Security   Dan Boneh, Stanford University  Workshop Purpose Despite tremendous advances in computer technology in general and
information security in particular, users still typically provide
personal information and credentials such as passwords the same way
they did 30 years ago: through a text interface that they assume they
can trust.  Today, that trust assumption clearly can no longer be
relied on.
Many security protocols have been proposed to protect credentials and
personal information, but few are used in practice. A major reason is
that the protocols have not been implemented in a way that ensures
that they are actually used. For instance, a rogue Web site can still
just ask the user for her password, regardless of how sophisticated a
protocol the correct site employs.
The purpose of the workshop is to facilitate an effective solution to
these problems by bringing together the designers of the cryptographic
protocols with the implementers of the user interfaces. Ideally, a
user should have confidence that when she provides a password or other
personal information, she can trust the interface she interacts with
to protect her data from misuse - even if an attacker happens to be
the one that asked her to provide it.
In short, our hope is that the workshop will motivate a trend where
trustworthy interfaces for passwords and personal information - TIPPI
- are the typical ones in our industry.
Current confirmed speakers include: Todd Inskeep, Bank of America. Roots of Trusted Interfaces and the User Experience. Dave Jevans, Anti-Phishing Working Group Ramesh Kesanupalli, Phoenix Technologies.
Solutions for Secure and Trustworthy Authentication. Steve Myers, Indiana University
Delayed Password Disclosure. Submissions: We welcome additional presentations, both long (30 minutes) and short

DIMACS Workshop on Information Security Economics
  January 18 - 19, 2007
  DIMACS Center, CoRE Building, Rutgers University
  Alessandro Acquisti, Carnegie Mellon University, acquisti at andrew.cmu.edu   Jean Camp, Indiana University, ljean at ljean.com
Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on Communication Security and Information Privacy and the Special Focus on Computation and the Socio-Economic Sciences.
    ************************************************
The deployment of an information security solution can be evaluated on
whether the benefits expected from its deployment are higher than the
costs of its deployment. Yet it is hard to quantify both benefits and
costs, due to uncertainty about factors such as attackers'
motivations, probability of an attack, and cost of an attack. This
uncertainty about the value of tangible costs and benefits is
complicated by intangible costs and benefits, such as user and market
perceptions of the value of security. The field of economics has well
developed theories and methods for addressing with these types of
uncertainty. As such, there has been a growing interest in the
economics of information security. Past notable work used the tools of
economics to offer insights into computer security, offered
mathematical economic models of computer security, detailed potential
regulatory solutions to computer security, or clarified the challenges
of improving security as implemented in practice. The goal of this
workshop is to expand that interest in economics of information
security. To meet this goal the workshop will bring together
researchers already engaged in this interdisciplinary effort with
other researchers in areas such as economics, security, theoretical
computer science, and statistics. Topics of interest include economics
of identity and identity theft, liability, torts, negligence, other
legal incentives, game theoretic models, security in open source and
free software, cyber-insurance, disaster recovery, reputation
economics, network effects in security and privacy, return on security
investment, security risk management, security risk perception both of
the firm and the individual, economics of trust, economics of
vulnerabilities, economics of malicious code, economics of electronic
voting security, and economic perspectives on spam.
Call for Participation:
Investments in information security are contingent on the expected benefits and costs of their deployment. Yet, it is difficult to
quantify those trade-offs: uncertainties about attackers' skills and
motivations, systems' dependability, and the consequences of security failures are heightened by intangible considerations - such as individual perceptions of the value of security. In recent years, growing attention has been directed towards the application to

    ************************************************
The deployment of an information security solution can be evaluated on
whether the benefits expected from its deployment are higher than the
costs of its deployment. Yet it is hard to quantify both benefits and
costs, due to uncertainty about factors such as attackers'
motivations, probability of an attack, and cost of an attack. This
uncertainty about the value of tangible costs and benefits is
complicated by intangible costs and benefits, such as user and market
perceptions of the value of security. The field of economics has well
developed theories and methods for addressing with these types of
uncertainty. As such, there has been a growing interest in the
economics of information security. Past notable work used the tools of
economics to offer insights into computer security, offered
mathematical economic models of computer security, detailed potential
regulatory solutions to computer security, or clarified the challenges
of improving security as implemented in practice. The goal of this
workshop is to expand that interest in economics of information
security. To meet this goal the workshop will bring together
researchers already engaged in this interdisciplinary effort with
other researchers in areas such as economics, security, theoretical
computer science, and statistics. Topics of interest include economics
of identity and identity theft, liability, torts, negligence, other
legal incentives, game theoretic models, security in open source and
free software, cyber-insurance, disaster recovery, reputation
economics, network effects in security and privacy, return on security
investment, security risk management, security risk perception both of
the firm and the individual, economics of trust, economics of
vulnerabilities, economics of malicious code, economics of electronic
voting security, and economic perspectives on spam.
Call for Participation:
Investments in information security are contingent on the expected benefits and costs of their deployment. Yet, it is difficult to
quantify those trade-offs: uncertainties about attackers' skills and
motivations, systems' dependability, and the consequences of security failures are heightened by intangible considerations - such as individual perceptions of the value of security. In recent years, growing attention has been directed towards the application to
information security of economic models for the evaluation of complex trade-offs under risk and uncertainty. This economics of information security has offered mathematical models of returns on security investments and behavioral models of users' decision making; it has detailed regulatory solutions to cyber-security issues; and it has clarified the challenges of improving everyday security and privacy.

[Moderator's note: the Secure Routing focus may be of interest to some
readers. --Perry]
            Announcing DIMACS 2007-2010 Special Focus on                Algorithmic Foundations of the Internet
            The Internet has an ever-expanding role in our daily lives; yet, it is
arguably one of the most fragile components of our nation's critical
infrastructure. The Internet was designed as a research network
without the expectation that it would eventually be used for
everything from banking, commerce, and telecommunications to the
remote management of power networks. The scale and heterogeneity of
the Internet have far surpassed all expectations, and the Internet is
responding by showing signs of strain. Moreover, new applications
heighten the need for security and network management capabilities,
neither of which were major goals in the original design of Internet
DIMACS is hosting a 3-year special focus devoted to the study of
algorithms and protocols for large-scale networks. The focus is
scheduled to start in August 2007 and continue through July 2010. The
special focus aims to enhance our understanding of the limitations of
today's protocols, as well as the gains that new designs could
achieve. This is an emerging cross-disciplinary area that requires
expertise from several fields including networking, theory of
computing, computer and communications security, and game
theory. Research collaborations spanning these communities are crucial
to making progress on the most challenging problems, and enabling
these collaborations is a major goal of this special focus.
As the Internet continues to grow, more and more business-critical
functions rely on its availability. One can easily envision a future
in which the vast majority of communications traffic, including
telephone, television, radio, business data, and government data, will
rely on an Internet infrastructure that is available and secure. For
the Internet to meet these challenges, we need a much deeper
understanding of the properties of our existing protocols and the
fundamental tradeoffs that should guide the design of the future
Internet. Providing a strong algorithmic foundation for the Internet
is especially timely, as the research community embarks on an
ambitious rethinking of the Internet architecture.
There are many algorithms and protocols used in the Internet and its
applications. Some adequately serve their desired purposes, while
others need improvement. However, there is a disconnect between the
methodology and results of algorithms research and the methodology and
results used to guide the adoption of Internet protocol standards. On
the one hand, traditional distributed-algorithms research does not
adequately model the Internet's design goals, including autonomy,
scalability, and privacy. On the other hand, protocol-adoption
standards far too often rely on experimentation and testing by vendors
and select customers, not on formal analysis. Protocols are often
tweaked to add customer functionality without scrutinizing the
resulting behavior in worst-case situations or proving any kind of
correctness or security properties. Furthermore, these worst-case
situations occur more often than expected, due to both the sheer size
of the network and the fact that malicious agents can use security
flaws to take control of significant parts of the Internet.
This special focus seeks to bridge the gap between networking research
focused on the existing artifacts - the protocols and mechanisms
underlying today's Internet - and the new work that needs to be done
to lay a solid foundation for the design of a future
Internet. Research focusing on today's network emphasizes
characterization, primarily through measurement and prototyping, of
existing protocols and mechanisms, in order to improve our
understanding of the Internet and guide incremental changes to the
system. Although algorithmic models have played a role in this work,
the details of today's protocols and mechanisms often defy attempts to
impose rigorous models "after the fact." The future Internet needs to
be more secure, be easier to manage, and take greater advantage of new
underlying technologies, such as sensor networks, wireless networks,
and optical switching. This argues for the design of new protocols and
mechanisms with their key properties in mind from the outset. An
algorithmic mindset is an extremely important ingredient in this line
of research.
This special focus is guided by a deep understanding of the current
Internet but allows for the possibility of radical change where it is
warranted. The focus seeks to analyze and design protocols,
algorithms, and architectures for a future Internet that is based on
sound mathematical and computational foundations, ensuring
scalability, security, and manageability.
This special focus is particularly timely given NSF's and the
computing research community's interest in developing the protocols
and associated experimental infrastructure for the Internet's next
generation. A special focus on algorithmic foundations of the Internet
is especially timely in light of NSF's FIND (Future INternet Design)
and GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovations) initiatives. The
FIND program encourages the research community to take a clean
slate approach to the design of a future Internet, without the
constraints of backwards compatibility with the current
protocols. FIND provides a unique opportunity to create a new network
architecture built on a solid conceptual foundation. In addition,
deeper understanding of the limitations of the existing protocols and
of the fundamental trade-offs between different design goals can focus
researchers' attention on the most promising directions for a new
Internet architecture.
This special focus aims to facilitate research in this area through
the broad participation from both the networking and theoretical
computer science communities. In addition to encouraging
collaborations between the two communities, focus activities can
educate the participants and the larger community about the current
research challenges and known results in the two areas. The special
focus workshops and working groups target the "sweet spots" where the
crucial challenges for designing the future Internet (e.g., security,
network management, layer-2 technologies, and economic incentives)
have rich connections to algorithms research (e.g., cryptography,
formal analysis, game theory and mechanism design, and streaming
The research ideas enabled by this DIMACS activity can lead to new
protocols and architectures that can be evaluated on GENI. Focus
workshops are encouraged to include presentations on the GENI facility
in order to encourage experimentation on GENI and explore how to put
the key design principles of GENI such as virtualization on a strong
theoretical footing.
Opportunities to Participate
The Special Focus includes:  Workshops: A variety of workshops and mini-workshops are being planned, including:    Internet Tomography    Pervasive Networks, Systems and Applications    Internet Privacy    Wireless and Delay-Tolerant Networks    Data Structures and Algorithms for Large-Scale Networked Systems    Internet Economics and Game Theory    Adversarial and Non-Adversarial Online Algorithms and Mechanism Design for the Internet  Working Groups: Three interdisciplinary research working groups,
 one initiated during each year of the special focus, form the "spine" of the special focus:    Year 1: Secure Internet Routing    Year 2: Designing Networks for Manageability    Year 3: Data Structures and Algorithms for Network Data  Tutorial: The special focus begins with a tutorial on "Next Generation Networks" that  provides background knowledge to those who wish to participate in the special focus or  just get an introduction to some of the fundamental issues in the field.

      New Brunswick, New Jersey
  **  DEADLINE FOR EARLY REGISTRATION IS ALMOST HERE **
   Hosted by:
      Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey
      DIMACS-CAIT Laboratory for Port Security
      Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (DIMACS)       Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Information Privacy and Security    Sponsored by:

   *********************************************************************
   Informatics research has emerged as a key scientific discipline and
   applications domain supporting counterterrorism and homeland security's
   missions of anticipation, interdiction, prevention, preparedness and
   response to terrorist acts.  ISI 2007 provides a forum for discussions among
   these vital communities: academic researchers (in information technologies,
   computer science, public policy, and social studies), local, state, and
   federal law enforcement and intelligence experts, and information technology
   industry consultants and practitioners.  Security informatics is a rapidly
   growing multidisciplinary area that crosscuts numerous disciplines,
   including computer science, information technology, engineering, public
   policy, medicine (medical informatics), biology (bioinformatics), social and
   behavioral sciences, political science, and modeling and analysis.  The
   combination of intelligence and security informatics strives to integrate
   computational social science, advanced information technologies and
   algorithms to support counterterrorism and homeland security policies,
   organizations and operations (both domestically and internationally).
   Because of the conference's location near major New York - New Jersey ports,
   one of its key themes is port security, where the term "port" is used here
   in its broad sense, namely, as a point of entry/exit for secure flows of
   people and cargo.  Other themes cover the components of effective
   counterterrorism, dynamic data analysis, and critical-infrastructure
   protection technologies.  This conference aims to foster the development and
   growth of a counterterrorism and homeland-security community by providing a
   forum and podium for diverse communities: academia, government (local,
   state, federal law enforcement, intelligence experts, etc.) and industry
   (consultants and practitioners etc.).  We solicit contribution of long or
   short papers, and proposals for panel discussions on both the science and
   the practice of intelligence and security informatics.  The conference
   proceedings will be published as an IEEE publication.  Several satellite
   conferences will also be held before ISI-2007.
   The upcoming IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security
   Informatics 2007 (ISI 2007) will be held May 23-24, 2007, in New Brunswick,
   New Jersey, at the Hyatt Hotel. There will also be two satellite
   conferences: The 2007 Conference on Interdisciplinary Studies in Information
   Privacy and Security. This conference will be held on May 22nd, 2007 from 9
   a.m to 5 p.m. at the University Inn, Douglass Campus, Rutgers, New
   Brunswick. The second event is the NSF Workshop on Biosurveillance Systems
   and Case Studies, May 22, 2007, New Brunswick, New Jersey.
   The two previous symposia on ISI (ISI-2003, ISI-2004) were held in Tucson,
   Arizona; the third (ISI-2005) in Atlanta, Georgia; the fourth
   (ISI-2006) in San Diego, California. These meetings provided a stimulating
   intellectual forum for discussions among previously disparate communities:
   academic researchers (in information technologies, computer science, public
   policy, and social and behavioral studies), local, state, and federal law
   enforcement and intelligence experts, and information technology industry
   consultants and practitioners. Proceedings of these past ISI meetings were
   published in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

    ************************************************
An ever-increasing amount of data is available in digital form, often
accessible via a network. Not surprisingly, this trend is accompanied
by an increase in public awareness of privacy issues and by
legislation of privacy laws. The interest in privacy, and the tension
between privacy and utility of data, is amplified by our growing
ability to collect and store large amounts of data, and our ability to
mine meaningful information from it. This workshop will view privacy
in a broad sense in order to facilitate interaction and discussion
between privacy-oriented researchers in different communities.
The study of "privacy" is inherently interdisciplinary, spanning a
range of applications and scenarios, such as analysis of census data,
detection and prevention of terrorist activity, and biomedical
research. There is a fundamental interplay between privacy and law,
security, economics, and the social sciences. This workshop will
foster interactions between researchers in these fields with those in
statistics and computer science, toward the goal of developing problem
formulations that can be translated into a technical mathematical
language that lends itself to a more rigorous study of privacy. The
workshop will contrast these formal definitions with more intuitive
notions of privacy from the social sciences, economics, philosophy and
law to determine the extent to which they capture the perceived
meaning of privacy in different settings.
Privacy-preserving technologies may soon become an integral part of
the basic infrastructure for the collection and dissemination of
official statistics, as well as for research in business, economics,
medical sciences, and social sciences. Functional solutions for
preserving privacy would therefore serve as a central part of the
infrastructure for those disciplines. This workshop will address a
variety of questions on algorithms for privacy-preserving analysis
such as:
  * To what extent can such techniques be applied to      statistical data?
  * What are the consequences to privacy and confidentiality      if such techniques are not used?
  * Are changes in statistical tools needed to make them      compatible with such techniques?
  * Can the techniques be modified to allow use of standard      statistical tools and practices? Pre-registration deadline: January 28, 2008
