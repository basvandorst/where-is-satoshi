@_subject: [Cryptography] Magic spells and Medieval medicine. 
Apologies for any cross-posting.
Dear Cryptography Listers,
Ever since the publication of journal article The Language and Writing System of Manuscript MS408 Explained, we have been busy translating the plant pages in order to construct the lexicon for the manuscript. They all relate to matters of female reproduction and the complications that can arise, so the many plant species are used for various medicines.
In the latest paper the plant is used as a form of magic '?a' for the purpose of rectifying the damage done by the extreme physical manipulation '?ora' described in the previous paper. So, the manuscript does contain some magic after all. :0)
Here is the link to Plant Series, No. 5: Please spread the word far and wide.

@_subject: [Cryptography] The Voynich Manuscript as a product of a mental 
Sent: 12 February 2019 03:25
That's a very sound theory and now my second favourite.  Though it is
more likely to be correct than my favourite theory, I still just
thoroughly enjoy this one:
    Hi Ben/Peter,
I've already told Cryptography list - the Voynich manuscript was written by a Dominican nun in perfectly ordinary language and she was entirely sound of mind. The writing system was solved in May 2017 and a paper will be formally published in 2019. In the meantime, three draft papers are available to freely download from the preprint linguistics website LingBuzz:
The first paper explains the writing system and language: The second paper translates the pictorial map from the manuscript: The third paper focuses on volcanological details from the map: I don't know where such an idea as schizophrenia might come from - most odd, and ironic too. The book is merely a memoire and a compendium of Medieval medical advice. I'm familiar with such fantastical nonsense as aliens, black magic, communist propaganda, conspiracy, hoaxing, practical joking, alchemy and the rest - but schizophrenia? Plain daft!

Fellow Cryptography Listers,
Those of you interested in historic codes and ciphers may wish to know that the codex of manuscript MS408 (Voynich) has been decrypted. A peer-reviewed paper is due to be formally published in a journal in 2019.
In the meantime, three draft papers are available to freely download from the preprint linguistics website LingBuzz:
The first paper explains the codex of the writing system and language: The second paper translates a pictorial map from the manuscript: The third paper focuses on volcanological details from the map: Please disseminate this information to other scholars who may find it useful.

Does anyone here have the expertise (I certainly don't) to say whether this
latest discovery is a credible one, or might it be another of those "every few
months" articles?
Re: [Cryptography] Historic Codebreaking.
Hi Sidney,
In reply: You are all rather late arrivals I'm afraid, as the solution was found early 2017 - my apologies for not finding your mailing list earlier.
The solution is certainly correct and thoroughly tested. A more comprehensive article has now been peer-reviewed ready for publishing in a journal in 2019. A formal announcement will be made in due course.
It has been highly amusing to witness people's reactions mind you. Had the manuscript first been found recently then no one would have blinked an eye at the solution. As it is, the manuscript has garnered a curious reputation for being mysterious and impossible, but only because many people have failed to decipher it for so long.
It turned out to be an extinct language and an unknown writing system - quite simple really, in hindsight. 'Hiding in plain sight' as they say.

When can we look forward to further translated pages?  Thank you.

Thanks for the note Grant,
I'm currently involved with an unrelated project, so my time is compromised. But, I'll translate more of the manuscript when time permits.
The purpose of the algorithmic instruction paper is for others to learn the translation method for themselves. I'll be interested to see their results.
Have a splendid weekend everyone.

I skimmed the PDF at your link, and his decoding of Voynich makes more sense than any other analysis I have seen.  I'd say he's got it.  Maybe we can put this mystery to rest now.  (But, no, it's not strictly cryptographic in nature...)
Grant Schultz
Hello Grant, Mark, Everyone,
Many thanks for your note.
Indeed  - that's the idea of a peer-reviewed and verified paper - in fact, I 'got it' two years ago, in May 2017. I did say it wasn't cryptographic right from the start - just a normal alphabet and language (like this email).
I hope many scholars can now benefit from translating the manuscript now that the solution has been made official.

Dear Scholars,
The decipherment of a Medieval manuscript page has revealed the record of a rare Mediterranean plant, from c. 1444. The plant is Atropa baetica, which is now endangered and included on the IUCN Red List. You may freely download a paper giving the translation and additional information: It should be of interest to anyone studying language cryptography and......botany - interesting combination!

Dear Listers,
You may be interested to read that the source of Linnaeus' idea on using the mythology about Andromeda and Perseus to name a plant genus has been found in a page of a Medieval manuscript, dating from 1444.
It had previously been thought that Linnaeus had indulged in a flight of wild imagination in naming the plant Andromeda, but we now know that he was simply referencing familiar medicinal folklore about the plant, which had since been lost to history. Now it has been rediscovered.
