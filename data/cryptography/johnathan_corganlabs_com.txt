@_subject: [Cryptography] CD bootable Linux (was randomness +- entropy) 
This is only marginally related, but I recently published a set of
scripts to more easily create bootable DVDs with "full disk encryption":
It basically automates the process of starting with an existing Ubuntu
ISO image, unpacking the ISO filesystem, the initrd, and the root
filesystem, making changes, then repacking everything with the option to
turn the compressed root filesystem into a LUKS volume.
At boot time, the passphrase is queried and the root filesystem is
mounted with both on-the-fly decompression and decryption.
The original use case for this was to enable distribution of business
confidential work product to my clients in a cheap, archivable format
without worry if it gets lost.
However, the use cases are many; it makes a nice Bitcoin cold storage
solution to have the OS and bitcoin (deterministic, SPV) wallet software
along with the bitcoin private keys, stored on encrypted, low-cost,
read-only media.
