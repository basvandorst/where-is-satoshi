KDC returns the error code KADM5_PASS_Q_DICT (which it will only do
if your Kerberos admin has inserted a dictionary check, as there is
none by default), the MS password-changing client fishes in

(This sheds no light on what it might do if you try a password with

Trusting that Perry will declare this OT before too much longer ...
Neither the University of Chicago's graduate program in theoretical
physics nor Noah Webster's successors introduced to me that that
science-fictiony word "gravitic", but let's assume it's completely
redundant with "include the weight of the cable."
I don't know squat about an undersea cable, except that it's heavily
armored against damage.  Let's suppose it weighs no more than would a
4-cm diameter solid steel cable.  That, in water, would be something
like 6 kg per meter.
Assuming there was only the minimum required amount of slack required
for the hypothetical lifting (or equivalently, that the cable was
being stretched just enough to reach the surface), and supposing that
the units of length in the example are kilometers, then the tension
in the cable turns out to be pretty close to a uniform 1500 kN, which
also turns out not to be far above the typical tensile strength for
the assumed cross-section of steel, and well within the strength of
special-purpose items like conveyor belts in coal mines.

Sure.  Imagine RSA where instead of a fixed public exponent (typically 2^16 + 1), you use a large random public exponent.  After computing the private exponent, you discard the two primes and all other intermediate information, keeping only the modulus and the two exponents.  Now it's very hard to compute either exponent from the other, but they do constitute a public/private key-pair.  The operations will be more expensive that in standard RSA where one party has a small exponent and the other party has an arithmetical shortcut, but still far less computation than cracking the other party's key.

Assume that some invertible function f() turns no input message into a longer output message.
We can prove that it also does not make any message *shorter*, and hence is not a "compression" function after all.
In particular, f() turns every one-bit message into a one-bit message.
Suppose f() preserves the length of all n-bit messages, for 1 <= n <= N.  (This is already the case for N=1.) What does f() do to a message M of N+1 bits length?  By assumption, f(M) is not N+2 bits or longer.   But all output messages of N bits or less are the result of some input of N bits or less and hence cannot be f(M).  So by elimination, f(M) is N+1 bits long.
By mathematical induction, f() preserves the length of every message.

may or may not turn out to be a group.
For blocks of n bits and keys of m bits, there are n! permutations  but 2^m of them are representable by some key.  If m = n, this is a  fraction roughly equal to
   (2e/n)^n
About 10^-70 for n=64.  I don't know the probability of a randomly  selected subset of a permutation group being a group, but at these  scales, I bet it's small.

@_subject: de-identification 
I don't know the state of the art, but I can tell you the state of the artless.  I had a request to share ourr border router traffic logs (Cisco netflow) with a university, so they could try out some anomaly detection schemes they were working on.
(Bkgnd: We don't consider our network topology sensitive. Our traffic logs are subject to a general respect for privacy.)
Since they could send us packets of their choosing, I deemed it useless to obfuscate our own IP addresses.  I chose to anonymize all the external addresses.  My design note is below.
But then, as fate would have it, the university said they needed the true external addresses.  That left me a bit stumped.  Perhaps a less chaotic mapping, like one that is bijective between classful network numbers, would do.
obfuscation filter program
   Parameters
     Blocks of IP addresses deemed internal.  Internal includes multicast
     addresses and RFC 1918 "private use" address.
   Working data preserved across runs
     For each date, a database of (true address, substituted address)    Algorithms
     Substituted addresses are pseudo-random, formed by MD5-hashing a
     string (S | D | A | N) and taking the first 32 bits.
       S = fixed secret hash seed, long term
       D = date of data, in YYYYMMDD format
       N = integer, starting at 0 and incremented if resulting address
           is an internal one or a collision.
     to obfuscate an IP address: {
       if it's internal, return it unchanged.  otherwise
        is a substitute is already assigned?  If so, return it. otherwise
         for ( done = N = 0; !done; N++ ) {
           generate substitute address by hashing as above
           if ( !collision ) done = 1
         }
         save forward & reverse mappings
     }
     for each netflow record {
       i = 0
       if ( src is external ) {
         obfuscate src; i++
       }
       if ( dst is external ) {
         obfuscate dst; i++
       }
       if ( i != 1 ) log an unusual condition
       write output
     }
   generator loops over input files, applying obfuscator, writing    output file, then renaming completed output file to permanent name.
   mover looks for completed output files, copies them to destination,    looks for more, sleeping and retrying if there are none.
Other notes:
   The obfuscated mappings can be regenerated at will if exactly the same data
   is processed in the same sequence, and the secret hash seed is known.

@_subject: PK -> OTP? 
My educated-layman's opinion is that the following is not feasible, but I'd be happy to be shown wrong ...
Given a closed public-key device such as a typical smart card with its limited set of operations (chiefly "sign"), is it possible to implement a challenge/response function such that
* Both the challenge and the response are short enough for an average user to be willing to type them when needed.
* The challenge can be generated, and the response verified using the cardholder's public key and a reasonable amount of computation.
My reasoning is that the full output of the signing function will almost always be as long as the key, if only response = f(signature) is given, with f having a range in some set of size ~ 2^32, verifying response must be nearly as hard as brute-force guessing.

I so often get irritated when non-physicists discuss entropy.  The  word is almost always misused. I looked at Shannon's definition and  it is fine, from a physics point of view.  But if you apply  thoughtfully to a single fixed sequence, you correctly get the answer  If your sequence is defined to be { 0, 1, 2, ..., 255 }, the  probability of getting that sequence is 1 and of any other sequence,  0.  Plug it in.
If you have a generator of 8-bit random numbers and every sample is  independent and uniformly distributed, and you ran this for a  gazillion iterations and wrote to the list one day saying the special  sequence { 0, 1, 2, ..., 255 } had appeared in the output, that's a  different story.  But still, we would talk about the entropy of your  generator, not of one particular sequence of outputs.

If you can put your question into the form, "Source A or B is chosen  with probability pA or 1-pA.  Output X is generated.  What is the  probability that it was source A that was chosen?" then Bayesian  inference can answer the question.  However, you don't generally have  a known a priori probability of each source being chosen, and you  don't even know the characteristics of the "other" source.  You can  generalize to an arbitrary number of alternative sources, but that  doesn't provide the prior data that's lacking.
