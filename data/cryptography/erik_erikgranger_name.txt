don't have anything of substance to add, I just wanted to say that.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Trump wants to collaborate with the Russians to 
Call me crazy, but I think that it is of utmost importance that the
president of the US, whomever that may be, and the leader of Russia,
whomever that may be, should be best friends.
I think this neo-mcarthyism is a bit dangerous, as people seem to forget
that both the United States and Russia have H-bombs. Any petty stuff
about elections is kinda not as important as making sure that, no matter
what, no escelations exist between the United States and Russia.
If a country has H-bombs, diplomacy is of utmost importance. This
saber-rattling that I'm seeing over the elections is rather concerning,
considering that nothing less than the future of the human race is at
stake. Compared to a nuclear winter, rigging elections seem tame.
Not that I'm in favor of rigging elections, whether it is Russia doing
it or the largest election-rigger in modern times, the United States,
but once you have stakes that reach a certain level, one should be more
cautious than Americans seem to be.

could do other than having compromised software actually used in elections?
I'm open to other possibilities. Assuming that no actual access to other
parts of the state's tech is exposed to russian coders, no, I think this
is really not that much of a threat. I could be wrong.
transforming our diplomatic relations than collaborating on a matter of
national security in which the Russians have already attacked us once?
It is not really clear that the Russians have attacked the US in regards
to voting machines; the accusations of voter fraud on the part of the
Russians is not confirmed as of yet. It may be confirmed in the future,
though .
Also, there are likely plenty of more effective ways of transforming our
diplomatic relations. I don't want to go on a tangent, because we've
been reminded about trying to stick to the tech, but there are plenty of
hypothetical scenarios that would do a better job.
but maybe it needs stating: the premise behind cryptography is that you
have an adversary who is bound by technical limitations but not by any
other rules. They will lie, cheat, and steal in order to compromise you.
That includes, but is not limited to, pretending not to be your
adversary, which is the basis of the most elementary attacks: phishing
and social engineering.
Yes, and I don't see how a pet project between Russian and US-employed
programmers, even if one side or the other has nefarious intent, is
really that dangerous. The danger comes in actually *using* the software
in an election, which I don't think Trump has the ability to force, and
I don't think Russia is dumb enough to  try.
by accepting their false proffer of friendship (e.g. 419eater.com) but
this is fraught with peril and requires a fair amount of skill. I’m
trying very hard to keep my political views out of this discussion, but
I’m sorry, I don’t see how a reasonable person can possibly believe that
Donald Trump possesses the necessary skills.
I do not think that Trump is a genius when it comes to foreign policy; I
believe he's relatively ignorant. The only case I'm really making is,
from a security standpoint, any positive relationship with a country
that possesses H-bombs is, necessarily, preferable to a lack of a
positive relationship. Relative to the possibility of thermonuclear war,
which I consider the penultimate security vulnerability, the possibility
that America actually uses software written by Russians for our
elections is an acceptable risk when compared to the benefits of getting
any sort of diplomatic relationship between the US and Russia. At any
rate, the chances that the US does use the software is very remote, or
so I think.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Checkoin: physical crypto-cash 
Let's say that I have a golden eagle that has it's UUID registered on
the blockchain.
I can just copy the actual information and pretend that it is the original.
I'm going to sign this email. That doesn't prevent anyone from making a
copy of this text that also can be verified, they cannot change any of
the words, but the signature would still check out.
That's fine for e-mails because we're only interested usually in
ensuring that the actual words are words that I did, in fact, put out
there and that they are unmodified.
When it comes to gold, we not only need to ensure that the signatures
check out, but that they are not a copy as well.
How does your software verify what's in the actual package? Does it
somehow manage to do a signature of real-life objects?

@_subject: [Cryptography] Encrypted flash drives: Secure? 
I'm looking at some of the encrypted flash drives on the market, and one
from Corsair features all-hardware encryption with a pin-pad physically
located on the flash drive.
Anyone know whether these actually offer the security that one would
expect from a dedicated device? They have 256-bit AES encryption, and as
far as I can tell there are no drivers at all for the device, so it all
exists on the flash drive itself, but what's the keyspace on these
things? Would it be a good place to store my private keys, for instance?

@_subject: [Cryptography] Rubber-hose resistance? 
I was talking recently with a few buddies, and the idea came up that there ought to be a Trezor or Ledger-type wallet out there that somehow won't work if you have an exceedingly high heart rate, combined with some other sort of indicator.  The idea was that if someone ever wanted to steal your bitcoins, they could do it by scaring you into just sending them your bitcoins. If, however, people set up a wallet that wouldn't let them spend their bitcoins if they were under duress, using some menagerie of biometric indicators for authentication as well as duress detection, that this might make it harder for people to mug bitcoin owners. I think this might become a problem in the future as the IRS tries cracking down; lots of people out there might not have washed their coins correctly, and the price of coin-mixing is going through the roof with the tx fees, so it makes sense that in the future nefarious state actors such as IRS agents might try to conduct rubber-hose crypto-analysis to gain unwanted access to your holdings. What do you guys think?

Hello. Equifax was pwned, and I'm sure you all already are aware.
It make syou wonder, however, why a single 9-digit number is capable of such destruction. Why is your identity 9 digits long?
Sure, there are birth certificates as well, but the social security number is quite a strange phenomenon. So, here's a challenge for you guys if you're interested: Replace the social security number as a means of identification, and do it in such a way that meets some basic criteria.
-It has to not be completely objectionable and possibly evil (ie, a universal identification card or microchipping or requiring blood to be drawn, people would frea
-It has to be relatively unforgable, or as unforgable as you can figure out how to make it
-It has to be suitable for not just applying for Social Security benefits, but also for applying for loans, mortgages, etc. I really enjoyed reading the "Have I Been Pwned" discussion that is being had on this list. Hopefully this will also be an interesting conversation.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Crypto basic income 
That sounds fairly undesirable, and I don't think any cryptocurrencies that provide a basic welfare income will maintain any sort of economic desirability with consumers. Why would one trade in a cryptocurrency that is just emulating typical banking, instead of just using typical banking? It defeats the purpose of a pseudonymous, decentralized and immutable public ledger system.
A major thing of interest is that in the United States, biometrics are not protected under the bill of rights, meaning that you can be forced to unlock a phone that is locked with biometrics against your will. One would need to utilize a rubber hose in order to do that with a known phrase, assuming no mind-reading. This seems more appropriate for a doctor; suffice to say that is a limitation in the idea of using biometrics, if such a vulnerability is realized.

I think an interesting line of discussion. If software is flawed, I
think the next question from a security standpoint is, "Is software more

started with currency, then deeds to property, then people were putting

security protections for products like the iPhone, saying threats to

security,” he said in a statement. “Weakening security makes no sense
when you consider that customers rely on our products to keep their
personal information safe, run their businesses or even manage vital
infrastructure like power grids and transportation systems.”/
What are some possible technological responses that can be utilized to
protect against this sort of legislation? I'm curious what people here
would do if some legislation of this sort were written into law.

I've been following this, and one thing I'm confused about is what it
means by "automatic".
For instance, most people type in a password to decrypt an e-mail, and
the rest of the e-mails are then decrypted when you click on them. Is
this "Automatic"?
Do I really have to disable enigmail, or do I have to simply not decrypt
any messages until more information is released?
