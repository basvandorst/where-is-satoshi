The last discussion that I remember at an IETF TLS Working Group
meeting was that no additional ciphers would be added to TLS.  There
are already too many ciphers to be implemented and they are becoming an interoperability issue.

The scariest part of this proposed bill is its definition of the term
"Interactive Digital Device":
  The term "interactive digital device" means "any machine, device,
  product, software, or technology, whether or not included with or as
  part of some other machine, device, product, software, or technology,
  that is designed, marketed or used for the primary purpose of, and
  that is capable of, storing, retrieving, processing, performing,
  transmitting, receiving, or copying information in digital form."
This of course applies to all computer software since all programs
operate on data in "digital form".  Since all interactive digital
devices will be required to utilize certified security technologies
this would imply that every protocol used on the internet; every
program that reads/write from disk or from memory or from a CPU
register; will need to have an approved security technology.
Certainly the government is not in a position to develop a security
standard for each an every internet protocol: SMTP, FTP, HTTP, SSH,
TELNET, RSH, LDAP, DNS, ...  Not to mention every Hello World type
program that has ever been developed.  It is also unclear from the proposed bill what the purpose of the bill
is.    "To provide for private sector development of workable security
  system standards and a certification protocol that could be
  implemented and enforced by Federal regulations, and for other
  purposes."
Is this meant to be an add-on to the DCMA to make it easier for
commercial copyright holders to limit the types of devices that can be
built, sold, and used?  This could be done by having the laws specify
the use of standards requiring licensing of technologies that are only
available on a fee per instance basis.  (This would exclude the use of
any open source operating system.)
Is this meant to ensure that appropriate technologies are in all
personal devices (PCs, phones, PDAs, set top boxes, ...) to unsure the
privacy of the data sent and received by their users?  A worthy goal
although I doubt I want the government regulating which protocols and
security standards I can use.
In either case, it seems unrealistic to assume that the government can
regulate this effectively.  Will the government create their own
security standard for each protocol, service, application, computing
architecture, ... or will it simply order the use of standards
recognized by a group such as the IETF?  If the IETF (or a similar
group) where will the funding come from?  I'm sure the IETF does not
want to become a line item in the U.S. budget.

  that it would be secure.  There are two problems I have with it
  though.  One, is that I'm trying to think about the real world
  implications of this bill.  I'm trying to think if it will cause a lot

  Having one standard makes it the target to try and break, whereas if
  there are many different standards, it's less of a risk."

will lead the vast majority of the public at large to support bills
similar to this even if the end result would be a sharp reduction in

NY office donated several copies of Office XP.  The problem was that
during the crisis there was no method by which the copies could be
registered.  Therefore, after a small number of executions the
software came to a dead halt.  Given the time pressures we were forced
to abandon the work that was done in Office XP.  I grabbed an old copy
of Office 97 and used that instead since it didn't have the limits.

I believe that most browsers and even some TELNET/FTP/SMTP clients that support START_TLS will allow the certificate to be saved as an authenticator of the host provided that the certificate is not a self-signed cert.  If you do not want to use a commercial CA, then you should generate your own CA cert plus one End Entity cert signed by your CA cert.  Use the End Entity cert for your service.  This process could easily be added to the makefile for Apache or even OpenSSL.

Latest Da Vinci mystery: judge's own secret code
Thu Apr 27, 2006 8:11 AM ET
By Peter Graff
LONDON (Reuters) - Three weeks after a British court passed judgment in
the copyright case involving Dan Brown's bestseller "The Da Vinci Code,"
a lawyer has uncovered what may be a secret message buried in the text
of the ruling.
Lawyer Dan Tench noticed some letters in the judgment had been
italicized, and it suddenly dawned on him that they spelled a phrase
that included the name of the judge: "Smith code."
Justice Peter Smith, who during the trial displayed a sense of humor
unusual in the rarified world of bewigged barristers and ancient
tradition, appears to have embraced the mysterious world of codes and
conspiracy that run through the novel.
"I thought it was a mistake, that there were some stray letters that had
been italicized because the word processor had gone wrong," Tench told
Tench initially told The Times newspaper that apparently random letters
in the judge's ruling appeared in italics. Wouldn't it be clever if the
judge had embedded a secret message in the text? The Times ran a jokey item.
"And then I got an e-mail from the judge," said Tench.
He said Smith told him to look back at the first paragraphs. The
italicized letters scattered throughout the judgment spell out:
Those in the first paragraphs spell out "smith code."
But what does the rest mean?
The novel, and upcoming movie starring Tom Hanks, are about a secret
code that reveals ancient mysteries about Jesus Christ.
Smith, who ruled that author Brown had not plagiarized his hugely
popular thriller from another book, "The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail,"
has so far not given any clues to his own mystery code.
For now, the judge is not speaking. His clerk said he is refusing
interviews. She would not confirm whether there truly was a secret
mystery embedded in his judgment.
But she did confirm that he is, generally speaking, a humorous type of

Da Vinci judge's secret code revealed
Fri Apr 28, 2006 8:25 AM ET
By Peter Graff
LONDON (Reuters) - Mystery solved. It was the admiral.
A secret code embedded in the text of a court ruling in the case of Dan
Brown's bestseller "The Da Vinci Code" has been cracked, but far from
revealing an ancient conspiracy it is simply an obscure reference to a
Royal Navy admiral.
British High Court Justice Peter Smith, who handed down a ruling that
Brown had not plagiarized his book, had embedded his own secret message
in his judgment by italicizing letters scattered throughout the 71-page
In Brown's book, a secret code reveals an ancient conspiracy to hide
facts about Jesus Christ.
The judge's own code briefly caused a wave of amused speculation when it
was discovered by a lawyer this week, nearly a month after the ruling
was handed down.
But the lawyer, Dan Tench, cracked it after a day of puzzling. The
judge's code was based on the Fibonacci sequence, a mathematical
progression discussed in the book.
"After much trial and error, we found a formula which fitted," wrote
Tench, who had nothing to do with the Brown case but discovered the
italicized letters when studying the ruling.
The judge's secret message was: "Jackie Fisher, who are you?
Dreadnought," Tench wrote in the Guardian newspaper.
Judge Smith is known as a navy buff, and Fisher was a Royal Navy admiral
who developed the idea for a giant battleship called the HMS Dreadnought
in the early 20th century.
Tench wrote that the judge had e-mailed him to confirm he had guessed
the secret code right.
The judge later confirmed the existence of the code, and revealed that
the Fibonacci sequence was indeed the secret to its solution.
"The message reveals a significant but now overlooked event that
occurred virtually 100 years to the day of the start of the trial," he
said in a statement.
He said that he is not normally much of a fan of puzzles, such as the
Japanese number puzzles that have become an obsession of the British press.
"The preparation of the Code took about 40 minutes and its insertion
another 40 minutes or so," he wrote. "I hate crosswords and do not do
Sudoku as I do not have the patience."

@_subject: Status of SRP 
Unfortunately, SRP is not the solution to the phishing problem.
The phishing problem is made up of many subtle sub-problems involving
the ease of spoofing a web site and the challenges involved in securing
the enrollment and password change mechanisms.  SRP would allow a client
to know that a service is in fact the correct service when the
authentication succeeds.  However, it would not help in the situation
when the authentication fails.  This could be because the user is not
sure of what the password is or even sure which account name was being
Solving the phishing problem requires changes on many levels:
(1) Some form of secure chrome for browsers must be deployed where
    the security either comes from a "trusted desktop" or by per-user
    customizations that significantly decrease the chances that the
    attacker can fake the web site experience.  (Prevent the attacker
    from replicating the browser frame, toolbars, lock icons,
    certificate dialogs, etc.)
(2) Reducing the number of accounts and passwords (or other identifiers)
    that end users need to remember.  With a separate identifier for
    each and every web site it is no surprise that my extended family
    can never remember what was used at each site.   Therefore, it is
    not much of a surprise when a site says that the authentication
    failed.
(3) Secure mechanisms must be developed for handling enrollment and
    password changing.
Only then can we truly address the phishing problem.

James, SRP can only prevent spoof's of successful authentications
and it can only prevent spoof's when it is actually used.
It cannot prevent spoof's of unsuccessful authentications and that
is where a huge part of the problem lies.  Consider the reaction
of many individuals when they receive a page that indicates that
their username and/or password are incorrect?
Sites that offer the common secret question(s) can be spoofed.
The attacker spoof's sits in the middle, captures the question from
the real site, the answer from the user, and if the real site says
that the new password is being sent, puts up a new page indicating
that the password should be changed online along with prompts for
private information that the attacker wants.
Stopping phishing with successful authentication is not even half
the problem.

Many many years ago an office that a startup I was working for was
burglarized by picking the lock on the office door.  They took a number
of computers.  The police recommended that we replace the locks with XYZ
super lock that could not be picked and we did so at significant expense
prior to replacing all of the computers.
Three or four weeks later the office was burglarized again.  They could
not pick the lock so they took a sledgehammer to the wall next to the
door, reached in unlocked the door from the inside and proceeded to go
about their business.
This wasn't a failure of the lock.  The lock did its job.
The product you are describing is not snake oil.  You have a valid gripe
that the product is not marketed along with a description of the attack
vectors it protects against and those that it does not.
