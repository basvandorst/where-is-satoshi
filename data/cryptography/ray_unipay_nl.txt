To make their denial credible, they could give the owner access to the
private key of the TPM/SCP.  But somehow I don't think that jibes with
their agenda.
If I buy a lock I expect that by demonstrating ownership I can get a
replacement key or have a locksmith legally open it.

@_subject: dangers of TCPA/palladium 
Although I support the vote-with-your-wallet paradigm, this analysis
seems overly simplistic to me.  Macrovision doesn't solve problems for
most VCR purchasers, but they pay for it anyway.  They have no choice.
In some cases people are required to buy and use something that they
might not otherwise be inclined to pay for, e.g., catalytic converters
in automobiles (which also use palladium).  It doesn't seem reasonable
to similarly require TCPA in computers, but legislators might think
(or be lobbied) otherwise.
If the fears that some people have expressed prove justified and TCPA
becomes primarily a means to enforce draconian copyright restrictions,
then people may well choose to pay for it just to regain pre-TCPA
functionality.  In that case, the problems it solves for them are the
same ones it causes!

This may be a silly question, but how do you know that the source code
provided really describes the binary?
It seems too much to hope for that if you compile the source code then
the hash of the resulting binary will be the same, as the binary would
seem to depend somewhat on the compiler and the hardware you compile
on.  But this means that you also can't just use the TOR you compiled,
as you then won't be able to unseal any data sealed with the standard
TOR.  Or do I misunderstand how this all works (very likely the case)?

Sorry, I see from an earlier message of yours that you are looking for
a simple non-crypto solution, so I guess this doesn't fit the bill.
The examples you gave in your earlier message all seem to be
equivalent to having the participants send the data to a trusted third
party who performs the computation, except that the trusted third
party is transplanted to one or more of the participants computers,
which are protected against their owners.  I guess it boils down to
whether or not the level of trust is sufficient.  This seems iffy when
one of the participants is also the trust provider.

I, for one, support your efforts, even though I don't agree with some

Contactless smart cards typically have coils in the card and the
magnetic field is generated by the reader.
Capacitive coupling is an alternative but requires more precise
alignment and thus doesn't really provide a proximity/vicinity card
like inductive coupling does.
On-board batteries are hard to fit on an ISO-format smart card but
maybe with the new ultra-thin batteries that's no longer the case.
Batteries are perhaps more suitable for a CD.

It could also be that a large chunk of the "Cert-host mismatch"
results are for alternate names of servers validly configured.
Also, it is not clear how multiple categories are counted, e.g., a
server with an expired cert from an unknown signer.  Even if there is
no double counting, if servers are counted as "Unknown signer" or
"Expired" before "Cert-host mismatch", then multiple names for the
same host could also inflate the numbers for those categories.

Nitpick: I think RCE stands for Regional Coding Enhancement.
player runs to select menus, etc.  It checks whether the player is set
to play discs from other regions, and if so puts up a failure message.
So an all-region player won't play an RCE disc, and the disc itself is
region-free so an auto-switching player doesn't know which region to
set.  But manually setting the region works (as you pointed out).
I don't know what's done in Sweden, but I suspect that if the use of
RCE becomes more widespread then most future region-free players will
support selecting the region.  Here in the Netherlands one can have
most DVD players modified to be region-free.  Consumer electronics
shops will do it, so I assume it's legal.

This may be due to not only your TV but also your VCR.  Some have
"NTSC PLAYBACK ON PAL TV" (PAL60), which uses PAL color encoding but
NTSC scanning rate, which most PAL TVs can handle.
The output of your player from a region 1 DVD is probably not NTSC but
rather PAL60.  A disc may be labeled NTSC (or PAL) if it is formatted
for a scanning rate of 525/60 (resp. 625/50), but this is a bit of a
misnomer because the encoding of the color signal is determined by the
player and is not inherent to the disc.

How "illegal" are these grey market units?  For unlicensed units made
legally in jurisdictions not subject to the patents, is the illegality
in the importing and/or selling?  Are modified ("cracked") players
necessarily illegal?
It's legal to own several DVD players of differing regions so it seems
odd that it would be illegal to have them in a single package sharing
common components (everything but a byte of firmware).  Manufacturers
are presumably prevented from doing this by the terms of their license
agreements (and some, like Sony, have vested interests).

@_subject: quantum hype 
I don't know a lot about QKD, but I believe the following is true:
The eavesdropper Eve doesn't know with which basis to measure the
polarity of the each intercepted photon.  When she guesses right, she
gets the correct information and can send it on undetectably.  When
she guesses wrong, she gets a zero or one with equal probability (*)
and half the time sends on the wrong bit (which is again randomized
when Bob reads it with the correct basis).  By eavesdropping Eve thus
introduces a 25% error rate, which is detectable.
After Alice sends the random bits over the quantum channel, Alice and
Bob tell each other over an insecure (even public) classical channel
which bases they used (these were randomly chosen between rectilinear
and diagonal), and they throw away the bits for which they used
different bases.  Bob now knows all the remaining bits but still only
about half of them were measured correctly by Eve unless she was very
lucky.  The information available to Eve is further reduced via a
privacy amplification step (using universal hash functions, I think).
There are proofs of the security of QKD and mechanisms for quantum
authentication.  A google search will find these.
(*) This assumes that Eve's wrong basis is 45 degrees off from the
correct basis.  A different basis will introduce a bias, but that
doesn't help Eve.  Also, this simple description assumes that there is
no transmission error, that single photons can be sent and detected,
etc., which in practice is not true and needs to be corrected for.

@_subject: quantum hype 
As Dave Howe pointed out, Eve is acting as a repeater and tries not to
alter the bits.  This seems a sensible model of eavesdropping for QKD.
The threat is that Alice and Bob might incorporate bits that were seen
by Eve into their key.  If Bob never receives a bit, it won't be used.
The terminology "destroy" is used a bit loosely.  I think the
important thing for QKD is that if a photon is measured with the wrong
basis, the information it is carrying about the key is lost.

Their certificates are chained to the GTE CyberTrust root so browser
recognition is probably comparable to that of VeriSign and Thawte, but
they may be affected by what's happening with Baltimore.
P.S. Poking around a bit on the web I discovered a fascinating battle
raging between Comodo/InstantSSL and GeoTrust/FreeSSL.  They run sites
with similar names (whichssl.com and whichssl.org) that are made to
look like independent comparison guides but which show their own
products most favorably.  The whichssl.com site neglects to include
the less expensive FreeSSL in its comparison.  The whichssl.org site
(also called sslreview.com) does include InstantSSL, but emphasizes
stability concerns (because of Baltimore) and "unethical business
practices" of Comodo, and obscures the connection between GeoTrust and
FreeSSL.  FreeSSL's own site hints that fraudulent spam claiming to
come from FreeSSL is actually from Comodo ("likely to be from one of
GeoTrust's competitors ... messages originated from a UK based ISP").
The two members of FreeSSL's executive team listed on the site both
came from the management team of Comodo (where they were responsible
for InstantSSL), which may have something to do with the rivalry.
In any case, between InstantSSL (UK), FreeSSL (US), and ipsCA (ES),
there is a lot more available in the way of budget certs than I was
aware of.

Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC'05) is the premier
international forum for research, advanced development, education,
exploration, and debate regarding security in the context of finance
and commerce. We have augmented our conference title and expanded our
scope to cover all aspects of securing transactions and systems. These
aspects include a range of technical areas such as: cryptography,
payment systems, secure transaction architectures, software systems
and tools, user and operator interfaces, fraud prevention, payment
systems, secure IT infrastructure, and analysis methodologies. Our
focus will also encompass legal, financial, business and policy
aspects. Material both on theoretical (fundamental) aspects of
securing systems and on secure applications and real-world deployments
will be considered.
The conference goal is to bring together top cryptographers,
data-security specialists, and scientists with economists, bankers,
implementers, and policy makers. Intimate and colorful by tradition,
the FC'05 program will feature invited talks, academic presentations,
technical demonstrations, and panel discussions. This conference is
organized annually by the International Financial Cryptography
Association (IFCA).
Original papers and presentations on all aspects of financial and
commerce security are invited. Submissions must have a visible bearing
on financial and commerce security issues, but can be
interdisciplinary in nature and need not be exclusively concerned with
cryptography or security. Possible topics for submission to the
various sessions include, but are not limited to:
* Anonymity and Privacy

                            =======================
FC'05 is inviting submissions in three categories:
   (1) research papers,
   (2) systems and applications presentations,
   (3) panel sessions.
For all accepted submissions, at least one author must attend the
conference and present the work.
Research Papers
Research papers should describe novel scientific contributions to the
field, and they will be subject to vigorous peer review. Papers can be
a maximum of 15 pages in length (including references and appendices),
and accepted submissions will be published in full in the conference
proceedings. Submission of previously published material and
simultaneous submission of papers to other conferences or workshops
with proceedings is not permitted. Authors of research papers found to
be doubly submitted risk having all their submissions withdrawn from
consideration as well as other appropriate sanctions.
Systems and Application Presentations
Submissions in this category should describe novel or successful
systems with an emphasis on secure digital commerce
applications. Presentations may concern commercial systems, academic
prototypes, or open-source projects for any of the topics listed
above. Where appropriate, software or hardware demonstrations are
encouraged as part of the presentations in these
sessions. Contributions must reflect careful thought and effort and
provide valuable, up-to-date experience that is relevant to
practitioners in the fields of financial cryptography and data
security. Submissions in this category should consist of a short
summary of the work (1-6 pages in length) to be reviewed by the
Program Committee, along with a short biography of the
presenters. Accepted submissions will be presented at the conference
(25 minutes per presentation), and a one-page abstract will be
published in the conference proceedings.
Panel Sessions
Proposals for panel sessions are also solicited, and should include a
brief description of the panel as well as prospective
participants. Panel proposals should be submitted via e-mail, in plain
ASCII format, to the Program Chairs.  Accepted panel sessions will be
presented at the conference, and each participant will contribute a
one-page abstract to be published in the conference proceedings.
The Rump Session
FC'05 will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of the
evenings in an informal, social atmosphere. The rump session is a
program of short (5-7 minute), informal presentations on works in
progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the
conference. Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a
presentation to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced).  This
submission should consist of a talk title, the name of the presenter,
and, if desired, a very brief abstract. Submissions may be sent via
e-mail, or submitted in person through the Monday of the conference.
                       Preparation Instructions
                       ========================
Submissions to the research papers and systems/application
presentation categories must be received by the due date. Papers must
be formatted in standard PostScript, PDF format, or MS
Word. Submissions in other formats will be rejected. All papers must
be submitted electronically according to the instructions and forms
found on this web site. (Specific instructions for electronic
submissions will be published in the near future.)
Author names and affiliations on submissions must be explicit. In
other words, submitted papers should not be anonymized. Submissions
must include on the first page the title of the paper, the names and
affiliations of all authors, a brief abstract, and a list of topical
keywords. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference
proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in
Computer Science (LNCS) series after the conference, so the
submissions must be formatted in the standard LNCS format. Authors of
accepted submissions will be required to complete and sign an IFCA
copyright form. A pre-proceedings volume containing preliminary
versions of the papers will be distributed at the conference.
Questions about all conference submissions should be directed to the
Program Chairs.

   Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC'05) is the premier
international forum for research, advanced development, education,
exploration, and debate regarding security in the context of finance and
commerce.  We have augmented our conference title and expanded our scope
to cover all aspects of securing transactions and systems. These aspects
include a range of technical areas such as: cryptography, payment
systems, secure transaction architectures, software systems and tools,
user and operator interfaces, fraud prevention, secure IT
infrastructure, and analysis methodologies.
   FC'05 brings together top cryptographers, data-security specialists,
and scientists with economists, bankers, implementers, and policy
makers. Intimate and colorful by tradition, the FC'05 program will
features invited talks (to be announced), academic presentations,
technical demonstrations, and panel discussions. This conference is
organized annually by the International Financial Cryptography
Association (IFCA).

@_subject: AmEx unprotected login site 
For Verizon maybe, but there are plenty of Mom and Pop internet
merchants for which it is arguably more secure to do it this way.  The
merchant never sees the customer's payment information and thus
needn't know how to properly protect it, and one-time shoppers may not
know/trust the merchant anyway.  If the redirect is from a secure
merchant site to a secure payment provider site, and the merchant site
informs users where they will be redirected, is this so bad?

@_subject: [fc-discuss] Financial Cryptography Update: On Digital Cash-like Payment Systems 
This is not strictly correct.  The payer can reveal the blinding
factor, making the payment traceable.  I believe Chaum deliberately
chose for one-way untraceability (untraceable by the payee but not by
the payer) in order to address concerns such as blackmailing,
extortion, etc.  The protocol can be modified to make it fully
untraceable, but that's not how it is designed.
Apart from the transferability issue, I think there are some systems
that do not rely on an issuer at all (in effect any payee is an
issuer).  Manasse's Millicent comes to mind, but I confess that I
don't fully remember the details.

FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS
Usable Security (USEC'07)
February 15-16, 2007
Lowlands, Scarborough, Trinidad/Tobago
A workshop co-located with
The Eleventh Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security  Submissions Due Date: November 5, 2006, 11:59pm, PST
Some of the most challenging problems in designing and maintaining  secure systems involve human factors. A great deal remains to be  understood about users' capabilities and motivations to perform  security tasks. Usability problems have been at the root of many  widely reported security failures in high-stakes financial,  commercial and voting applications.
USEC'07 seeks submissions of novel research from academia and  industry on all theoretical and practical aspects of usable security  in the context of finance and commerce. The workshop will bring  together an interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners,  allowing experts in human-computer interaction, cryptography, data  security and public policy to explore emerging problems and solutions.

==    Submission Categories    ==
USEC'07 invites submissions in three categories: (1) research papers,  (2) abstracts and demos, and (3) working sessions. For all accepted  submissions, at least one author must attend the conference and  present the work.
Research Papers
Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have  been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a  conference with proceedings. Research  paper submissions should be at  most 12 pages, excluding bibliography and appendices (appendices may  include usability study materials and data).
Accepted submissions will appear both in a pre-proceedings, available  at the workshop, and in a formal proceedings. After receiving  feedback from the workshop, authors will have the opportunity to  revise their papers before submitting a camera-ready draft for the  final proceedings.
Abstracts and Demos
Submissions in this category should consist of a short summary of  work (1-3 pages in length) to be reviewed by the Program Committee,  along with a short biography of the presenters. Accepted submissions  will be presented at the conference, and a one-page abstract will be  published in the conference proceedings. Where appropriate, software  or hardware demonstrations are encouraged as part of the  presentations in these sessions.
Working Sessions
We are soliciting topics for working sessions at the intersection of  usability, security, finance and commerce. Working sessions will  explore topics in depth with significant paricipation from audience  members. Proposals for working sessions should include the proposed  topic, format (e.g., panel of invited experts, moderated discussion  session, design exercises), prospective participants, time required  and a plan for engaging participation from audience members.

@_subject: The bank fraud blame game 
There was a follow-up project called OPERA that implemented a user
trial of the CAFE system on the premises of the European Commission in
Brussels and two Greek banks in Athens (primarly with smart cards--the
infrared wallets worked too but most users didn't have them).
During the course of the CAFE project some commercial electronic purse
systems emerged, notably Proton (from Banksys in Belgium, replicated
in other counties under other names) and Mondex.  These were in many
ways less sophisticated than CAFE's system (which was multi-issuer,
multi-currency, privacy-respecting, etc.) but had serious commercial
backing.  For the most part these seem to have stagnated or died.  I
suspect that getting them to catch on would require drastic measures
such as:
- differential pricing: electronic purse payments are potentially
  cheaper to process than those of debit cards because they are
  offline, but consumers find it more convenient to keep money in
  their bank account than on a smart card and will likely continue to
  do so as long as it costs no more.  (This may become less of an
  issue if/when all vending machines and parking meters are on the
  internet anyway.)
- coercion: if vending machines and parking meters accepted only
  electronic purses and not cash, this would drive their adoption.
  Something like this happened with phone cards--here in this part of
  the world it is difficult to find a pay phone that still takes coins
  (except a few at airports).  Of course phone cards too have been
  somewhat obsoleted by ubiquitous cell phones (which might also make
  good electronic wallets--I believe NTT DoCoMo is/was taking this
  approach using FeliCa, but I haven't followed how it's doing.).

debate regarding information assurance in the context of finance and
commerce. We have assembled a vibrant program featuring 21 peer-
reviewed research paper presentations, two panels (on the economics
of information security and on authentication), and a keynote address
by David Dagon.  To view the complete program, visit:
We look forward to seeing you in Barbados!

@_subject: [Cryptography] prism-proof email in the degenerate case 
Very silly but trivial to "implement" so I went ahead and did so:
To send a prism-proof email, encrypt it for your recipient and send it
to irrefrangible at mail.unipay.nl.  Don't include any information about
the recipient, just send the ciphertext (in some form of ascii armor).
Be sure to include something in the message itself to indicate who
it's from because no sender information will be retained.
To receive prism-proof email, subscribe to the irrefrangible mailing
list at   Use a
separate email address for which you can pipe all incoming messages
through a script.  Upon receipt of a message, have your script attempt
to decrypt it.  If decryption succeeds (almost never), put it in your
inbox.  If decryption fails (almost always), put it in the bit bucket.
(If you prefer not to subscribe you can instead download messages from
the public list archive, but at some point I may discard archived
messages and/or stop archiving.)
The simple(-minded) idea is that everybody receives everybody's email,
but can only read their own.  Since everybody gets everything, the
metadata is uninteresting and traffic analysis is largely fruitless.
Spam isn't an issue because it will be discarded along with all the
other mail that fails to decrypt for the recipient.
Each group of correspondents can choose its own methods of encryption
and key exchange.  Scripts interfacing to, e.g., gpg on either end
should be straightforward.

@_subject: [Cryptography] prism-proof email in the degenerate case 
A simple way to distribute the load over multiple servers might be to
just to have them share a subscriber list, i.e., recipients are
subscribed to all of the lists and senders arbitrarily choose one to
send to (perhaps the one advertising the lowest load?).  This doesn't
lighten the load on the recipients, only on the servers.  It does
sidestep the anonymity tradeoff, though, and remains oblivious to the
crypto used (e.g., Bob & Carol can use gpg and Ted & Alice can use a
one-time pad and none of them need to know a system-wide hash function
for choosing the correct server).
For a bulletin-board-like system, you could perhaps achieve something
similar with a CDN.
I like the idea of sending out random messages to further frustrate
traffic analysis!
With a mailing list (as opposed to a bulletin-board-like system) you
needn't retain any messages on the server at all.  They would still
pile up in MTA queues and on POP servers and the like (and there'd be
a lot of duplication!) but this is largely self-limiting as they'd be
discarded as recipients pick up their mail.
OK, obviously this doesn't scale.

Thank you for the offer and if this were to catch on in any serious
way I might take you up on it!  For the moment, though, nobody has
subscribed to the irrefrangible list and the only message in the
archive is the test message I sent (oops, I just blew my anonymity!)

@_subject: [Cryptography] List of Proven Secure Ciphers / Hashes 
Although the OP was perhaps not very precise, I think something along
the lines of the following is meant: if S is a (polynomial-time)
symmetric encryption function, then { | exists k: S(x,k) = y} is
in NP (just nondeterministically guess the key k and verify that the
plaintext x yields the ciphertext y).

@_author: R. Hirschfeld 
@_subject: [Cryptography] List of Proven Secure Ciphers / Hashes 
Even though they are defined in terms of worst-case rather than
average-case complexity, I wouldn't say that P and NP are irrelevant.
If P = NP then there are no one-way functions, and no hard on average
problems (in NP).

@_date: 2014-09-08 06:17:25
@_author: R. Hirschfeld 
@_subject: [Cryptography] List of Proven Secure Ciphers / Hashes 
Since you have access to nondeterminism anyway, why not just go ahead
and guess R too while you're at it?

@_date: 2014-09-08 22:13:56
@_author: R. Hirschfeld 
@_subject: [Cryptography] List of Proven Secure Ciphers / Hashes 
I didn't say that, just the statement above.  I don't disagree with
anything you wrote, but I don't think it contradicts my statement.
Both one-way functions and hard on average problems have very specific
technical definitions.  They are widely believed to be important
(although perhaps not critical) for public-key crypto.  The existence
of either implies P != NP.
I certainly can't think of a compelling reason to redefine them!  The
usual practice when a complexity class doesn't capture what you're
after is to define a new one, and there's a whole zoo full of them.
BTW, avgP and distNP are average-case analogues of P and NP.
I wouldn't dream of it!
Perhaps you object to my parenthetical "(in NP)"?  I added that only
to make it clear that I was excluding even harder problems (e.g. in
EXPTIME), although this might be implicit from the definition of hard
on average.  I did not mean NP-hard or NP-complete.
And above that there is the arithmetic hierarchy, of which the
polynomial-time hierarchy is an analogue (with P analogous to
recursive and NP analogous to r.e., etc.).  And above that...

@_date: 2014-09-08 23:10:36
@_author: R. Hirschfeld 
@_subject: [Cryptography] List of Proven Secure Ciphers / Hashes 
I think you misunderstood my point, although maybe I misunderstood
yours.  Let me go through it more carefully.  If you still think I'm
off-base, let's take the discussion off-list so as not to bother
everybody else.
The OP wrote something vague about symmetric crypto being in NP if
known-plaintext attacks are allowed, and you replied that this was
meaningless.  I attempted to formalize what I conjectured he meant
(although perhaps he meant nothing of the sort!), namely that you can
recognize plaintext/ciphertext pairs in nondeterministic polynomial
time, i.e., for poly-time S, { | exists k: S(x.k) = y} is in NP.
This seems obvious.
You replied with the "Suppose ..." statement above.  I thought your
concern was that in addition to the key there might be a random IV,
and my point was that you could just guess that too and the set
remains in NP.
But I guess you meant something different.  Can you explain?
Why not?  If the goal is, given , to check whether S(x,k)=y for
some k, then you can guess up to a length polynomial in ||.  In
the case you suppose, tacking on a random bit string the same length
as x, it's linear.  In what way has this gone wrong?
It seems our wires are seriously crossed.  I also don't understand
your comment about why not just guess the message.  There's no need to
do so because you're given it (it's x, the known plaintext).

@_subject: [Cryptography] List of Proven Secure Ciphers / Hashes 
Showing P = NP (unlikely!) might indeed have little immediate impact
on crypto practice.  It depends on the nature of the proof.  If it's
by giving a practical efficient poly-time algorithm for an NP-complete
problem, that's a game changer.  If on the other hand you only know
that there exist poly-time algorithms for factoring and discrete log
but can't find them (or if you can find them but the degree and/or
coefficients are enormous), that's another matter.

@_subject: [Cryptography] List of Proven Secure Ciphers / Hashes 
Translate your factoring instance into a SAT instance via a poly-time
(or log-space) reduction.  (There are probably simple direct ways to
do this but in the worst case use the Cook's Theorem construction.)
Solve the SAT instance using the alien algorithm.  Rinse and repeat.
Rejoice because although some crypto is broken, many useful problems
thought to be hard have become easy.
P.S. I guess you may need to use a decision version of factoring and
then do a binary search to solve the function version, resulting in an
increase in running time by a logarithmic factor.

@_date: 2014-09-10 16:15:49
@_author: R. Hirschfeld 
@_subject: [Cryptography] List of Proven Secure Ciphers / Hashes 
The reduction is something you can actually do.  See for example
for some ideas (and links to some running code).  Even if you use the
construction from the proof of Cook's Theorem (which builds a Boolean
formula from the tableau of the computation of a Turing machine such
that the formula is satisfiable iff the machine accepts, or at least
that's how it was done way back when I learned it) it would be a pain
in the ass and a big mess, but it's not travel-to-Mars-hard.  ;-)

I think the decision problem you describe is actually in P, and is
just composites (or primes).  The decision problem for factoring is
usually something along the lines of: Does N have a (non-trivial)
factor less than m? (where 1 < m < N).  You can then do binary search
on m to extract the factors.
Here's an argument (I don't know whether you'll find it convincing):
There are many problems known to be NP-complete.  None of their
complements are known to be in NP.

On the other hand, there is a notion of algorithmic complexity of an
individual string, i.e., the length of the shortest program that
produces it in some universal programming language.  In this sense,
most strings are (Kolmogorov) random but those easy to generate (e.g.,
all nines, or the digits of pi) are not.
There are formal relationships between K-randomness and entropy.  And
also with computational complexity, e.g., a K-random oracle separates
P and NP.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Entropy is forever ... 
Well, I have no interest in arguing the point (I just pointed it out
because I thought might find it interesting) nor do I disagree with
what you wrote in your previous email, but I think that if you look at
the work of Solomonoff, Kolmogorov, Chaitin, et. al. you'll find that
this is what they describe.  You might not find it a useful notion,
but the notion does exist.
 gives an overview
although I'm not sure how good it is.
Interestingly, when the notion of Kolmogorov randomness is extended
to infinite strings, the particular universal description language
doesn't matter.
I was thinking of a theorem of Brudno (I think) that I had seen
mentioned somewhere but I don't remember the details.
With "universal" I wasn't referring to the probability measure but
rather to the programming/description language (similar to the
notion of a universal Turing machine).
I guess in some cases the "right" or "correct" probability measure is
a philosophical question.

@_author: R. Hirschfeld 
@_subject: [Cryptography] Entropy is forever ... 
I'm not sure exactly what you're driving at with this analogy.  If you
want to live by the latest theories that most closely match empirical
observation to date, great.  But to assert that they are "right" or
"correct" is to take a philosophical position.  And in the real world
it's often more practical to use a "wrong" theory, e.g., traditional
classical mechanics when relativistic effects are negligible.
Anyway, all I was saying is that there is a theory of randomness in
which some individual strings are considered more random than others.
I don't claim any practical relevance to cryptography, so perhaps
indeed that is enough said about it on this list.

Quite a feat as there's no Nobel prize in mathematics!  ;-)
As for unlikely, I've seen reports (from more credible sources) that
after Babai's breakthrough on graph isomorphism, factoring could be
next (although I'm not sure of the connection other than both problems
have long not been known to be either in P or NP-hard).
Perhaps there has been some breakthrough in factoring but the
implications were misreported.  It would impact crypto but maybe not
AES directly, except to the extent that factoring-based algorithms are
used to encrypt AES keys (something it's easy to imagine a reporter
getting wrong).
All speculation, though, and the article does read as BS or at least
sloppy journalism.

Submissions are accepted until 11:59pm, UTC-11.
Submissions are sought in the following categories:
(i) regular papers (15 pages LNCS format excluding references and (ii) short papers (8 pages LNCS format in total),
(iii) panel and workshop proposals (2 pages), and
(iv) posters (1 page).
The regular and short paper submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. In contrast, panel, workshop proposals, and poster submissions must include author names and affiliations.
Papers must be formatted in standard LNCS format and submitted as PDF files. Submissions in other formats will be rejected. All papers must be submitted electronically according to the instructions and forms found here and at the submission site. For each accepted paper the conference requires at least one registration at the general or academic rate.
Authors may only submit work that does not substantially overlap with work that is currently submitted or has been accepted for publication to a conference/workshop with proceedings or a journal. We consider double submission serious research fraud and will treat it as such. In case of doubt contact the program chairs for any clarifications at fc17chair at ifca.ai.
Paper submissions should be uploaded through the conference submission website. Poster submissions and panel proposals should be sent to fc17chair at ifca.ai.
Regular Research Papers
Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished scientific contributions to the field, and they will be subject to rigorous peer review. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Submissions are limited to 15 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, so the full papers should be intelligible without them. Regular papers must be anonymous with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious Short Papers
Short papers are also subject to peer review, however, the intention is to encourage authors to introduce work in progress, novel applications and corporate/industrial experiences. Short papers will be evaluated with a focus on novelty and potential for sparking participants' interest and future research avenues. Short paper submissions are limited to 8 pages in standard LNCS format in total. The paper title for short papers should necessarily include the text "Short Paper:" Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. Short papers must be also anonymous with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references.
Panel Proposals
We especially would like to encourage submissions of panel proposals. These should include a very brief description of the panel topics, as well as of the prospective panelists. Accepted panel sessions will be presented at the conference. Moreover, each participant will contribute a one-page abstract to be published in the conference proceedings. Please feel free to contact us directly if you would like to further discuss the suitability of a certain topic. Panel submissions must not be anonymous and should be up to 2 pages, sent to fc17chair at ifca.ai.
The poster session is the perfect venue to share a provocative opinion, interesting established or preliminary work, or a cool idea that will spark discussion. Poster presenters will benefit from a multi-hour session to discuss their work, get exposure, and receive feedback from attendees. Poster submissions should be a 1-page abstract (in the same LNCS format) describing the poster. Please keep in mind that the poster deadline is later than the main paper submission deadline. The poster abstracts will be published in the proceedings. Poster proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to the posters chair at fc17chair at ifca.ai.
Workshop Proposals
Proposals for workshops to be held at FC17 are also solicited. A workshop can be full day or half day in length. Workshop proposals should include: (i) a title, (ii) a call for papers, (iii) a brief summary and justification - including how it would fit into the greater FC scope, (iv) a (tentative) Program Committee and its Chair, (v) one-paragraph biographies for key organizers, and (vi) the expected (or previous - if workshop has been held in previous years) number of submissions, participants and acceptance rates. Workshop proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to fc17workshops at ifca.ai.
The Rump Session
FC17 will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of the evenings in an informal, social atmosphere. The rump session is a program of short (5 minutes), informal presentations on works in progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the conference. Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a presentation to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced at the conference). This submission should consist of a talk title, the name of the presenter, and, if desired, a very brief abstract. Submissions may be sent via e-mail, or submitted in person in the morning on the day of the session.
Student Stipends
IFCA is seeking funding to continue its program of financial support specifically for students attending FC, and students are encouraged to submit work in anticipation that funding will be found.  Previous grants prioritized students presenting at the conference or associated workshops and students fresh to the field, but all students are encouraged to apply.  If you are interested in applying for stipend support, please email the FC17 general chairs at fc17general at ifca.ai with subject line 'student stipend' and a letter of support from your home institution confirming your student status and stating that a stipend would help make it possible for you to attend the conference.

New this year: Since its founding in 1997, Financial Cryptography and
Data Security has published research on digital currencies. With the
explosion of interest in cryptocurrencies prompted by the introduction
of Bitcoin, research papers on cryptocurrencies have appeared in both
the main conference and, since 2014, the Workshop on Bitcoin and
Blockchain Research. In recognition of this burgeoning field, the FC
steering committee has decided to incorporate the workshop into the main
conference as a new blockchain track. As such, Financial Cryptography
and Data Security now serves as the premier venue for cryptocurrency and
blockchain research. Topics of interest for the blockchain track
include, but are not limited to:
     * Applications Using or Built on Top of Bitcoin
     * The Bitcoin Protocol and Extensions
     * Blockchain Applications
     * Case Studies (e.g., of adoption, attacks, forks, scams, …)
     * Cryptocurrency Adoption and Transition Dynamics
     * Digital Cash and Payment Systems
     * Distributed Ledgers
     * Economic and Monetary Aspects of Cryptocurrencies
     * Economics and/or Game Theoretic Analysis of Cryptocurrency      * Forensics and Monitoring
     * Fraud Detection and Financial Crime Prevention
     * Legal, Ethical and Societal Aspects of (Decentralized) Virtual      * Peer-to-Peer Networks
     * Permissioned and Permissionless Blockchains
     * Proof-of-work, -stake, -burn, and Virtual Mining
     * Real-world Measurements and Metrics
     * Regulation and Law Enforcement
     * Relation of Cryptocurrencies to Other Payment Systems
     * Transaction Graph Analysis
     * Usability and User Studies
The intent is that the blockchain track will not be in parallel to
either the rest of the conference proper, nor to the workshops. Papers
from the conference, whether in the blockchain track or not, will be
presented from Monday to Thursday of the conference week, without
parallel sessions to the extent possible.  The workshops, as in previous
years, will be held in parallel to each other on Friday.

                   What's the deal with the deadline?!
New this year: A number of conferences, including this one in the past,
have had the habit of announcing one deadline, only to extend it by 3–7
days as the deadline approached, often citing fictitious "popular
requests" as an excuse. This year, the effect will be the same, but we
will be more transparent about the process.
All papers must be registered by Tue Sep 18, 2018. This means the
titles, authors, abstracts, topics, submission options, conflicts, etc.
(everything except the PDF of the paper itself) must be entered into the
submission system by this date. This date is firm and will not be
On September 17, 2018, we will announce (in this space) a block height
on the Bitcoin blockchain that we expect to be found the following day.
Once the block of that height is found and confirmed, let the last hex
digit of the hash of that block be L. Then the FC19 paper submission
deadline will be September (21+ceil(sqrt(L))), 2018. In table form:
                 L                Paper submission deadline

                 A, B, C, D, E, F Sep 25, 2018
When the paper submission deadline has been determined in this way, this
page will be updated, and that deadline will be firm. The program
chairs' interpretation of the above algorithm is final.
If this seems too bizarre to make sense of, then just pretend the paper
submission deadline is Sep 21, 2018, and you'll be fine.
                                Submission
Submissions are sought in the following categories: (i) regular papers
(15 pages LNCS format excluding references and appendices), (ii) short
papers (8 pages LNCS format in total), (iii) panel and workshop
proposals (2 pages), and (iv) posters (1 page).
The regular and short paper submissions must be anonymous, with no
author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. In
contrast, panel and workshop proposals and poster submissions must
include author names and affiliations.
Papers must be formatted in standard LNCS format and submitted as PDF
files. Submissions in other formats will be rejected. All papers must be
submitted electronically according to the instructions and forms found
here and at the submission site. For each accepted paper/poster the
conference requires at least one registration at the general or academic
rate, and paper authors must sign the IFCA copyright form when
submitting the final version.
Authors may submit only work that does not substantially overlap with
work that is currently submitted or has been accepted for publication to
a conference/workshop with proceedings or a journal. We consider double
submission serious research fraud and will treat it as such. In case of
doubt contact the program chairs for any clarifications at
fc19chair at ifca.ai.
Paper submissions should be uploaded through the conference submission
website, where authors should also report any conflicts with program
committee members. A for Papers   conflict exists if an author has the
same affiliation as a committee member, has ever acted as their PhD
supervisor or been supervised by them, or if they have been co-authors
on a paper within the past two years.
Poster submissions and panel proposals should be sent to
fc19chair at ifca.ai.
Papers that are submitted but ultimately not accepted to the main
conference may be considered for acceptance at one of the associated
workshops. If you would like to take advantage of this, please indicate
this preference when submitting your paper.
                         Regular Research Papers
Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished scientific
contributions to the field, and they will be subject to rigorous peer
review. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference
proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in
Computer Science (LNCS) series.  Submissions are limited to 15 pages in
standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. A total page
restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee
members are not required to read the appendices, so the full papers
should be intelligible without them. Regular papers must be anonymous
with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious
                               Short Papers
Short papers are also subject to peer review; however, the intention is
to encourage authors to introduce work in progress, novel applications,
and corporate/industrial experiences. Short papers will be evaluated
with a focus on novelty and potential for sparking participants'
interest and future research avenues. Short paper submissions are
limited to 8 pages in standard LNCS format in total. The paper title for
short papers should necessarily include the text "Short Paper:".
Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings.
Short papers must also be anonymous with no author names, affiliations,
acknowledgments, or obvious references. The authors of some submissions
not accepted as regular research papers may be offered the option of
acceptance as a short paper.
                             Panel Proposals
We especially would like to encourage submissions of panel proposals.
These should include a brief description of the panel topics, as well as
of the prospective panelists. Accepted panel sessions will be presented
at the conference. Please feel free to contact us directly if you would
like to further discuss the suitability of a certain topic. Panel
submissions must not be anonymous and should be up to 2 pages, sent to
fc19chair at ifca.ai.
                                 Posters
The poster session is the perfect venue to share a provocative opinion,
interesting established or preliminary work, or a cool idea that will
spark discussion. Poster presenters will benefit from a multi-hour
session to discuss their work, get exposure, and receive feedback from
attendees. Poster submissions should be a 1-page abstract (in the same
LNCS format) describing the poster. Please keep in mind that the poster
deadline is later than the main paper submission deadline. Poster
proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to the posters chair
at fc19chair at ifca.ai.
                            Workshop Proposals
Proposals for workshops to be held at FC19 are also solicited. A
workshop can be full day or half day in length. Workshop proposals
should include: (i) a title; (ii) a call for papers; (iii) a brief
summary and justification, including how it would fit into the greater
FC scope; (iv) a (tentative) Program Committee and its Chair(s); (v)
one-paragraph biographies for key organizers; and (vi) the expected (or
previous, if the workshop has been held in previous years) number of
submissions, participants and acceptance rates. Workshop proposals must
not be anonymous and should be sent to fc19workshops at ifca.ai.
                             The Rump Session
FC19 will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of the
evenings in an informal, social atmosphere. The rump session is a
program of short (5 minutes), informal presentations on works in
progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the
conference. Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a presentation
to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced at the conference). This
submission should consist of a talk title, the name of the presenter,
and, if desired, a very brief abstract. Submissions may be sent via
e-mail, or submitted in person in the morning on the day of the session.
                             Student Stipends
IFCA is seeking funding to continue its program of financial support
specifically for students attending FC, and students are encouraged to
submit work in anticipation that funding will be found. Previous grants
prioritized students presenting at the conference or associated
workshops and students fresh to the field, but all students are
encouraged to apply. If you are interested in applying for stipend
support, please email the FC19 general chair at fc19general at ifca.ai with
subject line "student stipend" and a letter of support from your thesis
supervisor or home institution confirming your student status and
stating that a stipend would help make it possible for you to attend the

                          Randomized deadline
Many security conferences, including this one in the past, have
claimed a firm deadline only to extend it by several days as the
deadline approached.  Keeping with the tradition started last year, we
will implement a randomized deadline in a verifiable way.
All papers must be registered by Tue Sep 17, 2019.  This means the
titles, authors, abstracts, topics, submission options, conflicts,
etc.  (everything except the final PDF of the paper) must be entered
into the submission system by this date.  This date is firm and will
not be extended.
On September 17, 2019, we will announce (in this space) a block height
on the Bitcoin blockchain that we expect to be found the following
Once the block of that height is found and confirmed, let the last hex
digit of the hash of that block be L.  Then the FC20 paper submission
deadline will be September (20+ceil(sqrt(L))), 2019.  In table form:
L                       Paper submission deadline

A, B, C, D, E, F        Sep 24, 2019
When the paper submission deadline has been determined in this way,
this page will be updated, and that deadline will be firm.  The
program chairs' interpretation of the above algorithm is final.
If this is too complicated, you are welcome to submit a final PDF any
time before Sep 20, 2019, which is guaranteed to be before the
                               Submission
Submissions are sought in the following categories: (i) regular papers
(15 pages LNCS format excluding references and appendices), (ii) short
papers (8 pages LNCS format in total), (iii) systematization of
knowledge papers (15 pages LNCS format excluding references and
appendices), (iv) panel and workshop proposals (2 pages), and (v)
posters (1 page).
Papers must be formatted in standard LNCS format and submitted as PDF
files.  Submissions in other formats will be rejected.  All papers
must be submitted electronically according to the instructions and
forms found here and at the submission site.  For each accepted
paper/poster the conference requires at least one registration at the
general or academic rate, and paper authors must sign the IFCA
copyright form when submitting the final version.  Alternatively,
individual papers can be published as fully open access--the publisher
charges authors a fee for this (currently EUR 38 per page).
Original submissions: Authors may submit only work that does not
substantially overlap with work that is currently submitted or has
been accepted for publication to any other peer-reviewed
conference/workshop with proceedings or a journal.  We consider double
submission serious research fraud and will treat it as such.  Note
that it is acceptable for papers to appear in non-peer-reviewed
formats (for example, as technical reports or in online archives such
as ePrint).  In case of doubt contact the program chairs for any
clarifications at fc20chair at ifca.ai.
Research paper submission: Paper submissions should be uploaded
through the conference submission website, where authors should also
report any conflicts with program committee members.  A conflict
exists if an author has the same affiliation as a committee member,
has ever acted as their PhD supervisor or been supervised by them, or
if they have been co-authors on a paper within the past two years.
Anonymous submission: Regular and short research paper submissions
must be anonymized with no author names, affiliations,
acknowledgments, or obvious references.  Failure to properly anonymize
submitted papers is grounds for a desk rejection without review.  It
is acceptable (but by no means required) for submitted papers to be
published online in non-anonymous form (e.g., on authors' web sites or
archives like ePrint or arXiv.org).  Program committee members will be
instructed not to actively seek to de-anonymize papers.
Panel, poster and workshop submission: Poster submissions and
workshop/panel proposals should be sent by email to fc20chair at ifca.ai
and should not be anonymized.
Re-submission to affiliated workshops: Papers that are submitted but
ultimately not accepted to the main conference may be considered for
acceptance at one of the associated workshops.  If you would like to
take advantage of this, please indicate this preference when
submitting your paper.
                        Regular Research Papers
Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished
scientific contributions to the field, and they will be subject to
rigorous peer review.  Accepted submissions will be included in the
conference proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture
Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  Submissions are limited to
15 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices.
A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings
version.  Committee members are not required to read the appendices,
so the full papers should be intelligible without them.
                              Short Papers
Short papers are also subject to peer review; however, the intention
is to encourage authors to introduce work in progress, novel
applications, and corporate/industrial experiences.  Short papers will
be evaluated with a focus on novelty and potential for sparking
participants' interest and future research avenues.  Short paper
submissions are limited to 8 pages in standard LNCS format in total.
The paper title for short papers must include the text "Short Paper:".
Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings.
The authors of some submissions not accepted as regular research
papers may be offered the option of acceptance as a short paper.
                  Systematization of Knowledge Papers
We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers.  To be
suitable for publication, SoK articles must provide an added value
beyond a literature review, such as novel insights, identification of
research gaps, or challenges to commonly held assumptions.  SoK paper
submissions are limited to 15 pages in standard LNCS format excluding
references and appendices.  Accepted submissions will be included in
the conference proceedings.  A total page restriction may apply for
the printed proceedings version.  Committee members are not required
to read the appendices, so the full papers should be intelligible
without them.  The paper title for systematization of knowledge papers
must include the text "SoK:".
                            Panel Proposals
We especially would like to encourage submissions of panel proposals.
These should include a brief description of the panel topics, as well
as of the prospective panelists.  Accepted panel sessions will be
presented at the conference.  Please feel free to contact us directly
if you would like to further discuss the suitability of a certain
topic.  Panel submissions must not be anonymous and should be up to 2
pages, sent to fc20chair at ifca.ai.
                                Posters
The poster session is the perfect venue to share a provocative
opinion, interesting established or preliminary work, or a cool idea
that will spark discussion.  Poster presenters will benefit from a
multi-hour session to discuss their work, get exposure, and receive
feedback from attendees.  Poster submissions should be a 1-page
abstract (in the same LNCS format) describing the poster.  Please keep
in mind that the poster deadline is later than the main paper
submission deadline.  Poster proposals must not be anonymous and
should be sent to the posters chair at fc20chair at ifca.ai.
                           Workshop Proposals
Proposals for workshops to be held at FC20 are also solicited.  A
workshop can be a full day or half day in length.  Workshop proposals
should include: (i) a title; (ii) a call for papers; (iii) a brief
summary and justification, including how it would fit into the greater
FC scope; (iv) a (tentative) Program Committee and its Chair(s); (v)
one-paragraph biographies for key organizers; and (vi) the expected
(or previous, if the workshop has been held in previous years) number
of submissions, participants and acceptance rates.  Workshop proposals
must not be anonymous and should be sent to fc20workshops at ifca.ai.
                            The Rump Session
FC20 will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of the
evenings in an informal, social atmosphere.  The rump session is a
program of short (5 minutes), informal presentations on works in
progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the
conference.  Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a
presentation to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced at the
conference).  This submission should consist of a talk title, the name
of the presenter, and, if desired, a very brief abstract.  Submissions
may be sent via e-mail, or submitted in person in the morning on the
day of the session.
                            Student Stipends
IFCA is seeking funding to continue its program of financial support
specifically for students attending FC, and students are encouraged to
submit work in anticipation that funding will be found.  Previous
grants prioritized students presenting at the conference or associated
workshops and students fresh to the field, but all students are
encouraged to apply.  If you are interested in applying for stipend
support, please email the FC20 general chairs at fc20general at ifca.ai
with subject line "student stipend" and a letter of support from your
thesis supervisor or home institution confirming your student status
and stating that a stipend would help make it possible for you to
attend the conference.

Submissions are accepted until 11:59pm, UTC-11.
                          Randomized deadline
Many security conferences, including this one in the past, have
claimed a firm deadline only to extend it by several days as the
deadline approached.  Keeping with the tradition started last year, we
will implement a randomized deadline in a verifiable way.
All papers must be registered by Tue Sep 17, 2019.  This means the
titles, authors, abstracts, topics, submission options, conflicts,
etc.  (everything except the final PDF of the paper) must be entered
into the submission system by this date.  This date is firm and will
not be extended.
On September 17, 2019, we will announce (in this space) a block height
on the Bitcoin blockchain that we expect to be found the following
Once the block of that height is found and confirmed, let the last hex
digit of the hash of that block be L.  Then the FC20 paper submission
deadline will be September (20+ceil(sqrt(L))), 2019.  In table form:
L                       Paper submission deadline
0                       Sep 20, 2019
1                       Sep 21, 2019
2, 3, 4                 Sep 22, 2019
5, 6, 7, 8, 9           Sep 23, 2019
A, B, C, D, E, F        Sep 24, 2019
When the paper submission deadline has been determined in this way,
this page will be updated, and that deadline will be firm.  The
program chairs' interpretation of the above algorithm is final.
If this is too complicated, you are welcome to submit a final PDF any
time before Sep 20, 2019, which is guaranteed to be before the
                               Submission
Submissions are sought in the following categories: (i) regular papers
(15 pages LNCS format excluding references and appendices), (ii) short
papers (8 pages LNCS format in total), (iii) systematization of
knowledge papers (15 pages LNCS format excluding references and
appendices), (iv) panel and workshop proposals (2 pages), and (v)
posters (1 page).
Papers must be formatted in standard LNCS format and submitted as PDF
files.  Submissions in other formats will be rejected.  All papers
must be submitted electronically according to the instructions and
forms found here and at the submission site.  For each accepted
paper/poster the conference requires at least one registration at the
general or academic rate, and paper authors must sign the IFCA
copyright form when submitting the final version.  Alternatively,
individual papers can be published as fully open access--the publisher
charges authors a fee for this (currently EUR 38 per page).
Original submissions: Authors may submit only work that does not
substantially overlap with work that is currently submitted or has
been accepted for publication to any other peer-reviewed
conference/workshop with proceedings or a journal.  We consider double
submission serious research fraud and will treat it as such.  Note
that it is acceptable for papers to appear in non-peer-reviewed
formats (for example, as technical reports or in online archives such
as ePrint).  In case of doubt contact the program chairs for any
clarifications at fc20chair at ifca.ai.
Research paper submission: Paper submissions should be uploaded
through the conference submission website, where authors should also
report any conflicts with program committee members.  A conflict
exists if an author has the same affiliation as a committee member,
has ever acted as their PhD supervisor or been supervised by them, or
if they have been co-authors on a paper within the past two years.
Anonymous submission: Regular and short research paper submissions
must be anonymized with no author names, affiliations,
acknowledgments, or obvious references.  Failure to properly anonymize
submitted papers is grounds for a desk rejection without review.  It
is acceptable (but by no means required) for submitted papers to be
published online in non-anonymous form (e.g., on authors' web sites or
archives like ePrint or arXiv.org).  Program committee members will be
instructed not to actively seek to de-anonymize papers.
Panel, poster and workshop submission: Poster submissions and
workshop/panel proposals should be sent by email to fc20chair at ifca.ai
and should not be anonymized.
Re-submission to affiliated workshops: Papers that are submitted but
ultimately not accepted to the main conference may be considered for
acceptance at one of the associated workshops.  If you would like to
take advantage of this, please indicate this preference when
submitting your paper.
                        Regular Research Papers
Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished
scientific contributions to the field, and they will be subject to
rigorous peer review.  Accepted submissions will be included in the
conference proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture
Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  Submissions are limited to
15 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices.
A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings
version.  Committee members are not required to read the appendices,
so the full papers should be intelligible without them.
                              Short Papers
Short papers are also subject to peer review; however, the intention
is to encourage authors to introduce work in progress, novel
applications, and corporate/industrial experiences.  Short papers will
be evaluated with a focus on novelty and potential for sparking
participants' interest and future research avenues.  Short paper
submissions are limited to 8 pages in standard LNCS format in total.
The paper title for short papers must include the text "Short Paper:".
Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings.
The authors of some submissions not accepted as regular research
papers may be offered the option of acceptance as a short paper.
                  Systematization of Knowledge Papers
We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers.  To be
suitable for publication, SoK articles must provide an added value
beyond a literature review, such as novel insights, identification of
research gaps, or challenges to commonly held assumptions.  SoK paper
submissions are limited to 20 pages in standard LNCS format excluding
references and appendices.  Accepted submissions will be included in
the conference proceedings.  A total page restriction may apply for
the printed proceedings version.  Committee members are not required
to read the appendices, so the full papers should be intelligible
without them.  The paper title for systematization of knowledge papers
must include the text "SoK:".
                            Panel Proposals
We especially would like to encourage submissions of panel proposals.
These should include a brief description of the panel topics, as well
as of the prospective panelists.  Accepted panel sessions will be
presented at the conference.  Please feel free to contact us directly
if you would like to further discuss the suitability of a certain
topic.  Panel submissions must not be anonymous and should be up to 2
pages, sent to fc20chair at ifca.ai.
                                Posters
The poster session is the perfect venue to share a provocative
opinion, interesting established or preliminary work, or a cool idea
that will spark discussion.  Poster presenters will benefit from a
multi-hour session to discuss their work, get exposure, and receive
feedback from attendees.  Poster submissions should be a 1-page
abstract (in the same LNCS format) describing the poster.  Please keep
in mind that the poster deadline is later than the main paper
submission deadline.  Poster proposals must not be anonymous and
should be sent to the posters chair at fc20chair at ifca.ai.
                           Workshop Proposals
Proposals for workshops to be held at FC20 are also solicited.  A
workshop can be a full day or half day in length.  Workshop proposals
should include: (i) a title; (ii) a call for papers; (iii) a brief
summary and justification, including how it would fit into the greater
FC scope; (iv) a (tentative) Program Committee and its Chair(s); (v)
one-paragraph biographies for key organizers; and (vi) the expected
(or previous, if the workshop has been held in previous years) number
of submissions, participants and acceptance rates.  Workshop proposals
must not be anonymous and should be sent to fc20workshops at ifca.ai.
                            The Rump Session
FC20 will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of the
evenings in an informal, social atmosphere.  The rump session is a
program of short (5 minutes), informal presentations on works in
progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the
conference.  Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a
presentation to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced at the
conference).  This submission should consist of a talk title, the name
of the presenter, and, if desired, a very brief abstract.  Submissions
may be sent via e-mail, or submitted in person in the morning on the
day of the session.
                            Student Stipends
IFCA is seeking funding to continue its program of financial support
specifically for students attending FC, and students are encouraged to
submit work in anticipation that funding will be found.  Previous
grants prioritized students presenting at the conference or associated
workshops and students fresh to the field, but all students are
encouraged to apply.  If you are interested in applying for stipend
support, please email the FC20 general chairs at fc20general at ifca.ai
with subject line "student stipend" and a letter of support from your
thesis supervisor or home institution confirming your student status
and stating that a stipend would help make it possible for you to
attend the conference.

IMPORTANT DATES
Paper registration: September 17, 2020 (firm!)
Paper submission: September 24, 2020 (firm!)
Paper notification: December 3, 2020
Workshop proposal submission: September 15, 2020 (for full
consideration; later submissions considered on rolling basis)
Workshop proposal notification: September 30, 2020 (on-time submissions)
Poster and panel submission: December 8, 2020
Poster and panel notification: December 22, 2020
Final pre-proceeding papers: February 1, 2021
Conference: March 1?5, 2021
Submissions are accepted until 11:59pm, AoE UTC-12.
Submissions are sought in the following categories:
(i) regular papers (15 pages LNCS format excluding references and (ii) short papers (8 pages LNCS format in total),
(iii) systematization of knowledge papers (20 pages LNCS format
excluding references and appendices),
(iv) panel and workshop proposals (2 pages), and
(v) posters (1 page).
Papers must be formatted in standard LNCS format and submitted as PDF
files. Submissions in other formats will be rejected. All papers must
be submitted electronically according to the instructions and forms
found here and at the submission site. For each accepted paper/poster
the conference requires at least one registration at the general or
academic rate, and paper authors must sign the IFCA copyright form
when submitting the final version. Alternatively, individual papers
can be published as fully open access?the publisher charges authors a
fee for this (currently EUR 38 per page).
Original submissions: Authors may submit only work that does not
substantially overlap with work that is currently submitted or has
been accepted for publication to any other peer-reviewed
conference/workshop with proceedings or a journal. We consider double
submission serious research fraud and will treat it as such. Note that
it is acceptable for papers to appear in non-peer-reviewed formats
(for example, as technical reports or in online archives such as
ePrint). In case of doubt contact the program chairs for any
clarifications at fc21chair at ifca.ai.
Research paper submission: Paper submissions should be uploaded
through the conference submission website, where authors should also
report any conflicts with program committee members. A conflict exists
if an author has the same affiliation as a committee member, has ever
acted as their PhD supervisor or been supervised by them, or if they
have been co-authors on a paper within the past two years.
Anonymous submission: Regular and short research paper submissions
must be anonymized with no author names, affiliations,
acknowledgments, or obvious references. Failure to properly anonymize
submitted papers is grounds for a desk rejection without review. It is
acceptable (but by no means required) for submitted papers to be
published online in non-anonymous form (e.g., on authors' websites or
archives like ePrint or arXiv.org). Program committee members will be
instructed not to actively seek to de-anonymize papers.
Panel, poster and workshop submission: Poster submissions and
workshop/panel proposals should be sent by email to fc21chair at ifca.ai
and should not be anonymized.
Re-submission to affiliated workshops: Papers that are submitted but
ultimately not accepted to the main conference may be considered for
acceptance at one of the associated workshops. If you would like to
take advantage of this, please indicate this preference when
submitting your paper.
REGULAR RESEARCH PAPERS
Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished
scientific contributions to the field, and they will be subject to
rigorous peer review. Accepted submissions will be included in the
conference proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture
Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Submissions are limited to 15
pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. A
total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version.
Committee members are not required to read the appendices, so the full
papers should be intelligible without them.
SHORT PAPERS
Short papers are also subject to peer review; however, the intention
is to encourage authors to introduce work in progress, novel
applications, and corporate/industrial experiences. Short papers will
be evaluated with a focus on novelty and potential for sparking
participants' interest and future research avenues. Short paper
submissions are limited to 8 pages in standard LNCS format in total.
The paper title for short papers must include the text "Short Paper:".
Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings.
The authors of some submissions not accepted as regular research
papers may be offered the option of acceptance as a short paper.
SYSTEMATIZATION OF KNOWLEDGE PAPERS
We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. To be
suitable for publication, SoK articles must provide an added value
beyond a literature review, such as novel insights, identification of
research gaps, or challenges to commonly held assumptions. SoK paper
submissions are limited to 20 pages in standard LNCS format excluding
references and appendices. Accepted submissions will be included in
the conference proceedings. A total page restriction may apply for the
printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to
read the appendices, so the full papers should be intelligible without
them. The paper title for systematization of knowledge papers must
include the text "SoK:".
PANEL PROPOSALS
We especially would like to encourage submissions of panel proposals.
These should include a brief description of the panel topics, as well
as of the prospective panelists. Accepted panel sessions will be
presented at the conference. Please feel free to contact us directly
if you would like to further discuss the suitability of a certain
topic. Panel submissions must not be anonymous and should be up to 2
pages, sent to fc21chair at ifca.ai.
The poster session is the perfect venue to share a provocative
opinion, interesting established or preliminary work, or a cool idea
that will spark discussion. Poster presenters will benefit from a
multi-hour session to discuss their work, get exposure, and receive
feedback from attendees. Note that the poster session will only take
place if there is a physical event. Poster submissions should be a
1-page abstract (in the same LNCS format) describing the poster.
Please keep in mind that the poster deadline is later than the main
paper notification deadline. Poster proposals must not be anonymous
and should be sent to the posters chair at fc21chair at ifca.ai.
WORKSHOP PROPOSALS
Proposals for workshops to be held at FC21 are also solicited. A
workshop can be a full day or half day in length. Workshop proposals
should include: (i) a title; (ii) a call for papers; (iii) a brief
summary and justification, including how it would fit into the greater
FC scope; (iv) a (tentative) Program Committee and its Chair(s); (v)
one-paragraph biographies for key organizers; and (vi) the expected
(or previous, if the workshop has been held in previous years) number
of submissions, participants and acceptance rates. Workshop proposals
must not be anonymous and should be sent to fc21workshops at ifca.ai.
Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on
a rolling basis for any remaining slots.
THE RUMP SESSION
FC21 will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of the
evenings in an informal, social atmosphere. The rump session is a
program of short (5 minutes), informal presentations on works in
progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the
conference. Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a
presentation to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced at the
conference). This submission should consist of a talk title, the name
of the presenter, and, if desired, a very brief abstract. Submissions
may be sent via e-mail or submitted in person in the morning on the
day of the session.
STUDENT STIPENDS
IFCA is seeking funding to continue its program of financial support
specifically for students attending FC, and students are encouraged to
submit work in anticipation that funding will be found. Previous
grants prioritized students presenting at the conference or associated
workshops and students fresh to the field, but all students are
encouraged to apply. If you are interested in applying for stipend
support, please email the FC21 general chairs at fc21general at ifca.ai
with subject line "student stipend" and a letter of support from your
thesis supervisor or home institution confirming your student status
and stating that a stipend would help make it possible for you to
attend the conference.
COVID-19 INFORMATION
Due to the ongoing global pandemic, depending on the developing
circumstances, it is possible that a physical meeting for FC21 will
not take place. Even if it does, we expect that some authors may have
difficulty traveling to the conference and we will make accommodations
for remote presentations.

We especially would like to encourage submissions of panel proposals.
These should include a brief description of the panel topics, as well
as of the prospective panelists. Accepted panel sessions will be
presented at the conference. Please feel free to contact us directly
if you would like to further discuss the suitability of a certain
topic. Panel submissions must not be anonymous and should be up to 2
pages, sent to fc21chair at ifca.ai.
The poster session is the perfect venue to share a provocative
opinion, interesting established or preliminary work, or a cool idea
that will spark discussion. Poster presenters will benefit from a
multi-hour session to discuss their work, get exposure, and receive
feedback from attendees. Note that the poster session will only take
place if there is a physical event. Poster submissions should be a
1-page abstract (in the same LNCS format) describing the poster.
Please keep in mind that the poster deadline is later than the main
paper notification deadline. Poster proposals must not be anonymous
and should be sent to the posters chair at fc21chair at ifca.ai.
WORKSHOP PROPOSALS
Proposals for workshops to be held at FC21 are also solicited. A
workshop can be a full day or half day in length. Workshop proposals
should include: (i) a title; (ii) a call for papers; (iii) a brief
summary and justification, including how it would fit into the greater
FC scope; (iv) a (tentative) Program Committee and its Chair(s); (v)
one-paragraph biographies for key organizers; and (vi) the expected
(or previous, if the workshop has been held in previous years) number
of submissions, participants and acceptance rates. Workshop proposals
must not be anonymous and should be sent to fc21workshops at ifca.ai.
Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on
a rolling basis for any remaining slots.
THE RUMP SESSION
FC21 will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of the
evenings in an informal, social atmosphere. The rump session is a
program of short (5 minutes), informal presentations on works in
progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the
conference. Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a
presentation to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced at the
conference). This submission should consist of a talk title, the name
of the presenter, and, if desired, a very brief abstract. Submissions
may be sent via e-mail or submitted in person in the morning on the
day of the session.
STUDENT STIPENDS
IFCA is seeking funding to continue its program of financial support
specifically for students attending FC, and students are encouraged to
submit work in anticipation that funding will be found. Previous
grants prioritized students presenting at the conference or associated
workshops and students fresh to the field, but all students are
encouraged to apply. If you are interested in applying for stipend
support, please email the FC21 general chairs at fc21general at ifca.ai
with subject line "student stipend" and a letter of support from your
thesis supervisor or home institution confirming your student status
and stating that a stipend would help make it possible for you to
attend the conference.
COVID-19 INFORMATION
Due to the ongoing global pandemic, depending on the developing
circumstances, it is possible that a physical meeting for FC21 will
not take place. Even if it does, we expect that some authors may have
difficulty traveling to the conference and we will make accommodations
for remote presentations.
