@_subject: NY Times reports: Documents show link between AT&T and NSA 
Am I wrong or if we were living in a DRM- or Trusted Computing- World,
those documents probably would be unreadable, if they were digital
documents? Also they could have prevented printing of the documents,
and so on.
Of course, the human is still the weaker ring, but this is not of much
help in such cases.

@_subject: FWD: [IP] Encrypting Bittorrent to take out traffic shapers 
Maybe I've missed a point, but with encryption I thought you can
*simulate* every communication pattern. You can send a flow of
constant, random data when you're not getting bittorrent data and
there you have another kind of connection. A full-duplex flow of data
can be a VoIP encrypted stream, a VPN, X session over ssh, whatever.
Or am I mistaken?
Also, since encryption will be used only to obfuscate the real data, I
think that even a simple XOR could suffice.
http[s], ftp, maybe ssh based on the port number. But if a BT
application listens on port 22, you're pretty much screwed up. And
also if I subscribe to an ISP that gives me *internet* access via
TCP/IP they should specify on the EULA which ports I should use or
my .2 euros.
