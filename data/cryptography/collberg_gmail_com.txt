@_subject: Fwd: Anyone make any sense out of this skype hack announcement? 
The skype client was reverse engineered several years ago:
? title = {Silver Needle in the Skype},
? author = {Philippe Biondi and Fabrice Desclaux},
? note = "\url{
? booktitle = {Black Hat Europe},
? month = "Feb-Mar",
? year = 2006
I don't know if the new crack reveals anything new. We have
a writeup about the Skype protection techniques in
"Surreptitious Software", our book on security-through-obscurity.
(Sorry for the blatant self-promotion).
