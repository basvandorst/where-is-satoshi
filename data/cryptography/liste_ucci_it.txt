Even if I would use biometrics for authentication I cannot prevent a voter at home in front of her PC to take a picture of the screen when she is voting as a proof of what she has voted for, or to sit next to a coercer with a gun watching her voting. The fact that the voter is remote and outside a controlled location makes it impossible to guarantee incoercibility and no-vote-selling. This is not a crypto or IT problem. I do not think (correct me if I am wrong) that it is possible to design a web-voting system where you can vote from any PC in the world which guarantees against this.
Consider that in Italy in normal political elections with only paper ballots (no voting machines) it happened that the mafia gave voters mobile phones with cameras or mini cameras to take a picture of the paper ballot when the voter was in the booth as a proof of the vote.
And this with armed police just outside the booth. What can I do when it is possible to vote from home?
Concerning a technical point on my system, the receipt that my system gives to the voter has data which allow easily to learn the vote, actually this is part of the procedure to check the correctness of the result. I know that there are protocols which aim to give receipts such 1. the voter can check that her vote has been counted correctly
2. she cannot prove to a third person how she has voted
(see for example Rivest "Three-ballot voting system") but I haven't found one which fits in with my system and at the same time is easy enough so that people can use it (they complain already that my system is too complicated...).
