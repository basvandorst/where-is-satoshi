@_subject: improving ssh 
That is, security by obscurity and either adding another dependency
(libpcap) or code involving many incompatibilities between systems which
OpenSSH portable is ported to (raw sockets interface). I think this
can explain why it wasn't included in OpenSSH.
Actually, this can be done at PAM library level with similar
effectiveness and greater simplicity (I did it some time ago as a PoC).
Dictionary attacks, however, should be prevented from by forcing users
to select strong passwords (appropriate PAM module, again).
Something like tcpwrappers? I think, this would be pre-filtering. How
would you want to do post-filtering?
And why not to advertise SSH version? There are as many pros as cons.
What kind of requests are you talking about?
...so one can easily enumerate existing system users.
And you didn't mention about 7. removing subliminal channels in D-H key
agreement and IV choosing for CBC and CTR modes. This issue was brought
up (for SSH, SSL and IKE/ESP) about year ago in Poland. You know,
kleptography is a funny thing.
