Persona used email addresses, actually, for the explicit reason that it
was easier to remember than a URI, and more familiar to end-users.

The response, of course, is to make sure you design your systems such
that you can't be put in this situation in the first place.  The newer
versions of Apple's phones, in fact, use a secure co-processor with
secure flash for this exact purpose.

It's worth noting, you'll very probably be in violation of whatever
country you belong to's laws if you mess with those codes without the
proper license.
In the US, for example, even amateur radio operators otherwise allowed
to do way more than the general public aren't necessarily allowed to
transmit spread spectrum outside certain spreading codes.

If you really want to be sure it's dead and buried, what about doing the erasure with inline asm? I know GCC, at least, has a keyword to tell it not to mess with a particular assembly block.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Regulations of Tempest protections of buildings 
One thing that may be true (this will vary highly with jurisdictions) is
that buildings which block the effective use of radio bands used by the
fire service may be required to install a repeater.  This isn't a /ban/
on such constructions, but rather an additional requirement for those
who do.  Not all jurisdictions will require this, but some will: NYC,
for example, it's section 917.1.2 of the NYc building Code and FC511 of
the New York City Fire Code.
(Nationally and internationally, the model codes are in Annex O of the
NFPA 1 and IBC 915 / IFC 510.  Reviewing these may be difficult;
unfortunately, building codes are proprietary in most jurisdictions.)

It would certainly complicate it.  You could try and get a zoning
variance, or see if you can have the system disabled when the fire alarm
isn't active... but this is very much down into the weeds of "specific
local regulations", if not "whatever you can convince the local fire
inspector of".  It seems /highly/ likely to me that there are facilities
in the US which have this kind of shielding in jurisdictions where local
fire codes require a repeater, so there's clearly some solution.
I suspect it really does come down to getting a variance or coming up
with some alternate approach that convinces the fire marshall to sign
off on it.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Key escrow scheme 
Why not simply use Shamir's Secret Sharing?  The security properties are
much stronger (SSS is information-theoretic secure such that a (k,n)
construction reveals no information with k-1 shares known.  The size is
fairly minimal too; IIRC, each share is no larger than the key itself
(thus, the total construction is n*bit size).

@_subject: [Cryptography] When HTTP is outlawed, the outlaws will use HTTPS 
Hello Peter,
I think this was our original sin.  We've conflated two different
security properties together, whereas DV TLS really only solves one of
them: "this is the site I'm trying to get to", and "I can talk to this
site without someone else listening in".  When we tell users that the
green lock means "everything is secure", we're implying both of these.
But, of course, it's not that simple; DV only solves  and even then
only if you get the domain right [0]. EV was meant to help fix  but
we've known for a while that it's only a partial fix [1].
I think what we need to do here is to help explain to users exactly
what they get when they see the green lock. I'm not sure how we can
help retrain them, especially while there is a long history of other
(and entirely useless) lock symbols being used to mistrain them [2].
Browsers can help with this, emphasizing the domain and de-emphasizing
subdomains, but I also think we need to be more careful in the future
when making "promises" about the security benefits of technology.
Yes, HTTPS was certainly more secure than HTTP and making sure users
were on HTTPS was valuable, but....
[0] Here we have all the fun of unicode look-alike domains with
punycode ("fооbаr" vs "foobar" -- which is which?).  Or, of course,
[1] EV has its own problems with names.  shows a
useful example.
[2] $SEARCH for "secured by logo" is a concerning experience.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Smart electricity meters can be dangerously 
I think it's even more fundamental: it's a simple tragedy of the
commons.  The meter manufacturers have no particular desire to spend
money (both in parts and, more significantly, in development and QA
time).  The power company doesn't really care, since any problem can
inevitably be blamed on someone else (THE EVIL HACKERS DID IT!  RUSSIA!
CHINA! THE NSA!), and the customers have ~no say in the products that
they choose.  (The power company is the one who selects the meter, at
least in the situations I'm familiar with.)
This is a spot that security gets dumped into a lot.  I wonder if
liability shifting could help fix the problem, or if that's just going
to end up in the same situation we're in now.  ("Nothing bad has ever
happened from doing X, so why change now?")  Regulatory solutions as you
recommend can certainly solve them, if they're government ordered.  I
fear even a voluntary standards body might not be enough, since the
"customers" here (the power company) doesn't have particular incentive
to do anything but choose the lowest cost option.
