Given all the excitement over the Cube attack, readers may be interested
to have a closer look at an earlier paper by Vielhaber:
Breaking ONE.FIVIUM by AIDA (an Algebraic IV Differential Attack)

I think this attack can be attributed to Klima and Rosa:

Security is relative -- you need to evaluate it against a threat model
and consider what goals you are trying to achieve.  A software solution
may succeed in deterring attackers from developing a way to strip the
DRM from a $0.99 mp3; if the mp3 only costs $0.99, then may be it isn't
worth the trouble of reverse engineering the software.
There is some academic work on how to protect crypto in software from
reverse engineering.  Look-up "white-box cryptography".
Disclosure:  the company I work for does white-box crypto.

The introduction to the following paper (from SAC 2002) gives a very
good overview of white-box crypto:
You're right -- a white-box implementation of a symmetric cipher
essentially creates an asymmetric cipher.  Despite this, there are still
situations where you might want a whitebox AES implementation running on
a client.  Consider a server that sends out updates to several hundred
clients (each client has its own key).  The clients are subject to
whitebox attacks but the server is not.  Rather than force the server to
do several hundred public-key operations when it needs to push out an
update, we might be able to save the server some work if use a symmetric

I agree. I think the paper overstates its novelty and implications.  It
seems to be an experimental implementation of a fault attack presented
by Boneh, DeMillo and Lipton (i.e. where it is assumed that single bit
errors affect the private exponent).  They target _some_ crypto
application** that uses the openssl library running on an fpga board.
Getting the attack to work in real life is no small feat, so they
deserve props for that, but they make a few questionable claims -- e.g.
they seem to state that the left-to-right fixed-window exponentiation
algorithm was thought to be immune to fault attacks.  In fact, adapting
the BDL attack, which was presented against a right-to-left algorithm,
to work against a left-to-right algorithm is straightforward, and so the
susceptibility of the left-to-right FWE algorithm has been known for
some time.
What I find much more strange about the paper is that the authors make
no mention of message blinding.  I could be wrong, but message blinding
would defeat their attack.  By default, an openssl server utilizes
message blinding in its private key operations, so there attack wouldn't
** I just had the following realization:  I had assumed that the authors
were attacking an openssl *server* running on the fpga board, but
perhaps that is not so.  They don't seem to make that specific claim.
They claim only to be attacking an "unmodi?ed version of the OpenSSL
library".  It is possible that they only created a toy RSA application
that generates signatures using the openssl library (i.e. by making
calls to specific openssl functions).  This would explain why they don't
discuss message blinding -- because they didn't enable it in their toy
application!  I suspect that's what they did.  In that case, their
experimental results say very little about the susceptibility of an
openssl server to fault attacks.  Wow... if I'm correct, then the
authors really need to be more clear about exactly what they did.

@_subject: copy of "On the generation of DSS one-time keys"? 
Daniel Bleichenbacher presented an implementation attack against DSA in
2001 titled "On the generation of DSS one-time keys".  I think it made
the rounds as a preprint, but I don't know if it was ever officially
published.  It's cited frequently (e.g. in the SEC1 doc
 but I cannot seem to
locate a copy.
Can anyone point me to a copy of this preprint?

It sounds like a good time to switch to 224-bit ECC.  You could even use
256-bit ECC, which is comparable to 3072-bit RSA (according to the table
on page 5 of the SEC 2 document).

I don't know of any systems (other than TLS) that make use of ecc over binary fields.  Does anyone else?  Is there a public spec you can point me to?

Thanks for your reply.
I'm interested in the question of whether a cryptographic library should bother to include support for binary curves.  The answer to that depends on what type of library we are talking about.
libsodium isn't a general purpose crypto library.  It makes (good) choices about the underlying crypto for the user.
but suppose you want to create a new TLS library.  Should you support binary curves?  or maybe you want to offer a library people could use when following FIPS 186-4.  TLS and FIPS 186-4 do mention binary ecc, but is it used in practice?
Has anyone seen TLS use binary ecc in real life?
Do any other spec/standards recommend binary ecc?

Nicola, thanks very much for your informative message!  And thanks to Rich for sharing the thread.
I had not looked at RFC 8422.  Here is the relevant section for those And for the FIPS 186-5 draft, it references the SP 800-186 draft -- the deprecation message is found there:
