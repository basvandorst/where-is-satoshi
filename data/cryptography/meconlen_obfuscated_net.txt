Applied Cryptography. Has no one found a way to perform an identity proof
such that you can prove who you are to a specific person? In the example in
the book Alice proves who she is to Bob who transmits to Carol, and Carol
proves that she is Alice to Dave. I'm curious what the problem is with
creating a proof that Alice is Alice such that only Bob can be assured that
she is Alice so that Carol can't use the proof to identify who she is to
