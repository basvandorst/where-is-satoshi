Cryptography affords an alternative.  Cryptography enables untraceable
persistent pseudonyms created and maintained via chains of anonymizing
remailers and broadcast replies.
In the nightmare scenario that you describe, untraceable nyms may be

But the capabilities of encrypted email go beyond mere confidentiality
and authentication.  They include also strongly untraceable anonymity
and pseudonymity.  This is accomplished by using chains of anonymizing
remailers, each having a large random latency for mixing with other

Hooray!  Nice to see things come up roses once in a while.
You are uniquely qualified right now to set forth instructions
comprehensible to other "Grannies" explaining how you solved this.
Hence the virtue of using CHAINS of remailers, so that if even just one
of them is good, your anonymity is secure.  (And the step after that is
to operate a remailer yourself so you KNOW one of them is good.)

But disclosure of what exactly?  That he is using the remailer network,
yes.  But the tail of the chain disconnects from any particular message

The adversary is further confused if Bob is injecting a dummy message
anyway every few hours, and simply substitutes his live message for one
of the dummies which would have gone.
Yes, but TOR is connection-based and deliberately low-latency, so
anonymity is not possible anyway [1,2].  (NSA-planted reflexive TOR

An adversary can verify an open source robot, but not such instructions.
NSA cannot verify a claim that such instructions have been given (unless
they know the lawyer's identity, but in that case they can "interfere").
(On the other hand, NSA cannot afford to assume that such a claim is a
bluff, and that's the strength of this idea.)
The intended interpretation of the "open source" clause in the original
problem statement is that anyone could inspect the workings of the robot
and verify that it does indeed "harbor a secret" and that if the signed
messages stop coming it will indeed release that secret.
(For example, in one implementation -- NOT CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY STRONG -- a
secret file's access permissions can only be granted by the robot.)

Some months ago on another mailing list the question was raised whether
there could be a cryptographically strong "dead man switch" wherein as
long as the owner of a certain secret key is alive, his frequent signed
messages to an open-source robot somewhere would prevent that robot from
revealing the information it harbors, but if the messages stop coming
the robot would release the information (presumably further encrypted to
selected recipients). [1]
James A. Donald pointed out that it couldn't be done because one could
simply disconnect the robot from the Internet.
The effect could still be achieved though, by putting the robot in a
place that cannot be disconnected from the Internet, such as a widely
used public web server.  But this is not cryptographically strong.
So the question is how did Snowden get the effect of a "dead man switch"
in the present case.

 Members of a "stealthmail group" -- call it "OurGroup" for purposes
 of this discussion -- are defined by their knowledge of the
 encryption keys created for the group.  With this package installed,
 mail addressed to OurGroup at stealthmail does not go directly to the
 Internet like ordinary mail, but gets encrypted by the OurGroup key,
 given an encrypted subject intelligible only with OurGroup keys, and
 queued to go to alt.anonymous.messages in place of a piece of cover
 traffic at the next scheduled sending time.  Meanwhile, all messages
 appearing on alt.anonymous.messages are downloaded into an incoming
 queue.  A POP3 server runs on the local host.  The mail reader is
 provided with filters so that when it fetches mail from this local
 server, messages having subject lines encrypted for OurGroup (or any
 other stealthmail group of which this host is a member) are decrypted
 by the appropriate key and presented.  Other messages are discarded.

Because it's useless for an untraceable pseudonym.  SSH security is
based on a /connection/.  It has low latency, allowing a resourceful
adversary to correlate packet traffic and volume between source and
destination, quickly identifying the owner of the pseudonym.
Contrast with email through anonymizing remailers with deliberately
long, random latency, where the security is in the /message/.

Well, of course.  That's been part of mixmaster forever.  The mixmaster
"dummy" parameter gives a piece of cover traffic indistinguishable from
live traffic until it is decrypted by the last remailer in the chain.
Those seriously wanting anonymity use a "rigorous regimen of cover

would have gone out, not /added/ to the pattern.
Or one runs a remailer herself and just adds her traffic to the flow,
