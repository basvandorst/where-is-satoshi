There was a chosen ciphertext attack presented on crypto 2000
by Joux and Jaulmes. Check the web.
See also "Key Recovery and Message Attacks on NTRU-Composite" by
Craig Gentry.
And the communication given at the rump session of crypto2001.
Back there an attack and a fix were simultaneously presented.
I couldn't find nor remember the details, see
 for some more
