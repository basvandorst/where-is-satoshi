And here, I thought that a portion of the security embodied in a SecurID token was the fact that it was a tamper-resistant, independent piece of hardware.  Now M$ wants to put the PRNG out in plain view, along with its seed value. This cherry is just begging to be picked by some blackhat, probably exploiting a hole in Pocket Outlook.

PRNG in plain
Thanks for the pointers.  I've also received some off-list mail
encouraging me not to dismiss this so quickly.  Time to study up a bit.
(and this, folks, is why I love the net)

Seems to me that APOP would accomplish much the same thing without the need for random padding, no?  Or is APOP not widely implemented?

@_subject: Delta CAPPS-2 watch: decrypt boarding passes! 
FWIW, MSP initial security screening wants to see your boarding pass.  I didn't see anyone try to avoid showing it.  The last time I was through SFO, this new jihad hadn't started, but I got yet another lesson in the lack of sense of humor among the staff.  Asked to take my creaky old ThinkPad 760XL out of its case to be x-rayed, I said "Be nice to it; it's old."  Whereupon I was invited out of line so the explosives residue screener could give it a wipedown.  Even so, it was better than the beginning of that trip, when I'd forgotten to take my Victorinox Signature off of my keychain.  (that's a 1.6" Swiss Army Knife with a pen, an LED flashlight and a 1.25" blade)  At least I was given the opportunity to FedEx it back to the office.
