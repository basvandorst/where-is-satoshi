Probably moving out of the domain of the crypto list.
volatile, like const, is a storage-class modifier.  As written, it
means a pointer to memory that is volatile; this means, in particular,
that you can't optimize away dereferences.  If you wrote
        char * volatile foo;
That means that foo itself is volatile, and you must fetch it from
memory whenever you want its value.
You might find the cdecl program useful...

doesn't make me feel very comfortable.  Also, there's no discussion of key
management, auditing, etc.  XCA is probably useful, but as a Level 1 CA,
not an enterprise root or management thereof.  Those are the points I

@_subject: PKI root signing ceremony, etc. 
The whole point is to enhance common practice, not stay at the lowest
common denominator.
You'd be wrong. :)  I did just download and use XCA for a little bit.
It's practically impossible to audit.  Every key in the database is
protected with the same password.  The system ask for the password
as soon as it starts up.  If I leave the program running while
I leave my computer, I'm screwed.  The key-holder isn't asked to
confirm each signing -- there's no *ceremony* -- and they never
enter the password after the program starts.  For any kind of root
these are all very bad.
XCA is pretty nice for a Level-2 or small Level-1 CA.  The template
management, etc., is pretty good.  (Having them tied to the key database,
and having the keys be unlocked while making cert requests, are both
real bad ideas, however.)

How many years have you been saying this, now? :)  How do those modern online environments achieve end-to-end content integrity and privacy? My guess is that they don't; their use of private value-add networks made it unnecessary.  If my guess is/was correct, than as more valuable transactions (or regulated data) flow over the commodity Internet, then those things will become important.  Make sense?  Am I right?
If so, then I believe that we need a federated identity and management infrastructure. The difference is that the third-party PKI enrollment model still doesn't make sense, and organizations will take over their own identity issues, as with SAML and Liberty.  Once you do that, adding "publicKey" as just another attribute is no big deal.  With any luck, the new year will bring the analogy SOAP::other middleware as SAML::x.509 :)

If you haven't already seen it, I highly recommend Don Davis's "compliance defects" paper (and slides!) available at   Abstract follows:
  Public-key cryptography has low infrastructural overhead because
  public-key users bear a substantial but hidden administrative burden.
   A public-key security system trusts its users
  to validate each others' public keys rigorously and to manage
  their own private keys securely. Both tasks are hard to do well,
  but public-key security systems lack a centralized infrastructure
  for enforcing users' discipline.  A "compliance defect" in a
  cryptosystem is such a rule of operation that is both difficult
  to follow and unenforceable.  This paper presents five compliance
  defects that are inherent in public-key cryptography; these
  defects make public-key cryptography more suitable for server-to-server
  security than for desktop applications.

Can someone explain to me why the expiring of a certificate causes new massive CRL queries?

I don't think you understood my question.  Why is crl.verisign.com getting overloaded *now.*  What does the expiration of one of their CA certificates have to do with it?  Once you see that a cert has expired, there's no need whatsoever to go look at the CRL.  The point of a CRL is to revoke certificates prior to their expiration.

It means that they learned the lesson when the erroneously issued
two MSFT certificates:
        In the future, VRSN patches will be issued as MSFT

I think your other reason was in fact the primary reason.  And, of course,
the primary enablers of the go-fast approach were, in fact, the very same
credit card companies.  They made a conscious business decision to treat
online transactions the same as conventional transactions -- I forget the
details, but it was pretty risk-free for a merchant to do online credit
cards, getting low surchage rates.  That, coupled with the US law that
limited consumer liability to $50, made CCard-over-SSL a no-brainer over
it wasn't a CCard transacdtion, my liability under SET was unlimited (at
least until Congress caught up to the technology).  Looking at the risk
management aspect, SET was a big loser for the customer.

@_subject: dual-use digital signature vulnerability 
See US patent 5,995,625. The abstract:
    A method of unwrapping wrapped digital data that is unusable
    while wrapped, includes obtaining an acceptance phrase from a
    user; deriving a cryptographic key from the acceptance phrase;
    and unwrapping the package of digital data using the derived
    cryptographic key. The acceptance phrase is a phrase entered
    by a user in response to information provided to the user. The
    information and the acceptance phrase can be in any appropriate
    language. The digital data includes, alone or in combination, any
    of: software, a cryptographic key, an identifying certificate,
    an authorizing certificate, a data element or field of an
    identifying or authorizing certificate, a data file representing
    an images, data representing text, numbers, audio, and video.

@_subject: That's gratitude for ya... 
The other day I sent Amir Herzberg a private note saying I thought his new tool was pretty neat, and though I'm sure he's heard it a lot, thanks.  He said nope, nobody else has said it, and I was stunned.
As we all know, but apparently don't fully appreciate, the social aspects of security don't fall into a binary good/bad evaluation.  This isn't a new key exchange protocol, where it can be objectively evaluated, ending up with a good/bad decision.  It's an open source idea implemented by competent people, designed to address a real, and growing, concern on the web.
Instead of saying "neat, thanks" or "have you thought about this?" The list is filled with lots of carping about trust, wanna-be pundits referencing Thompson's ACM paper, etc.  Sheesh!  Why would anyone bother?
Here's a real-world clue:  the folks who might really be helped by this, who might be saved from having their bank account raided, are *already* trusting click-to-install software.  If some of them click and just trust this, their surfing might be a bit more secure, and their lives just a bit better.
Why would mozilla embed this?  If they came here, to the putative experts, for an evaluation, they'd leave thinking Amir and company just invented Rot-13.  It's not that.  It's also not perfect.  BFD -- you got anything better?
PS:  A concrete suggestion for improvement:  when showing the user the CA that certified the target site, include a two-line corporate summary and a link to their home page.

I was told that one of the reasons SSL took off was because Visa and/or MC
told merchants they would "for the time being" treat SSL as card-present,
in terms of fraud penalties, etc.  If this is true (anyone here verify?
My source is on the list if s/he wants to name themselves), then SSL/SET
is an interesting example of betting on both sides.

@_subject: Digital signatures have a big problem with meaning 
I think signatures are increasingly being used for technical reasons, not legal.  That is, sign and verify just to prove that all the layers of middleware and Internet and general bugaboos didn't screw with it. People seem to be building systems that assume proper operation, and use signatures as an application-level way to check, and also as a line of defense to screen out outsiders, rather than hold insiders liable.
Loosly coupled, tightly contracted.

Those analogies aren't apt.  XML is a data format, so it's more like
Which is a nonsensical complaint.
I don't see it.  Yes, XML DSIG makes it possible to sign parts of an XML document.  And there are broken applications.  Er, so what?  Is the lack of certificate validation in outlook proof that S/MIME is broken?
So have your API take an XML document and output a signature that signs the exclusive canonicalization of that document, and includes the signer's certificate in the keydata.  Problem solved.  And that's a fair comparison, since S/MIME is just a profile of PKCS applied to email, right?  So use WS-Security which is a profile of XML DSIG applied to SOAP messages, for example.
In other postings, you've pointed out that "nobody" re-generates the DER, but instead keeps it around to verify the signature.  In the XML world we do it all the time; recreating and re-canonicalizing works.  I guess that proves S/MIME and PGP are fundamentally broken. :)

The very name of the term -- exception -- argues against using it as a
standard flow-of-control construct.  Python's for/else is better; it'd
be nice to see that show up in Java/C# some day.
This is wandering way far afield of the list charter.  In an effort
to maintain some relevance, I'll point out that code reviews, and
crypto programming, are rarely done, and arguably shouldn't, by
programming wizards.
