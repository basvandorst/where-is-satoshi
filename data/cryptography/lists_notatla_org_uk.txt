@_subject: Reliance on Microsoft called risk to U.S. security 
BUGTRAQ in the last 3 years lists over 80 mails on pine - including
reference to this recently:
    which also appears in candidates on cve.mitre.org.
(Mitre seem to take unreasonable time in converting candidates to
definite problems unless I'm misunderstanding their website.)
That could include web bugs for spammers.  I agree it's ridiculous to
read mail in a browser but a conventional MUA has risks too.
I write all mail to disk and view it with my favourite text editor.
This is convenient with practice.  Now I only want MUAs for sending
mail (it's worth it to get the correct references in my reply headers).
I use this script on one of my accounts where I accept HTML mail
(reluctantly from a hotmail user).
    The HTML conversion is done by lynx (confined by SubDomain).
This practice can result in running "mimencode -u" and "metamail -w"
on a few things.  It's not that common for a non-text message to get
past my procmail rules and have me choose to read it.
This is all pretty simple but certainly not mass-market.  I must order a
"told you so" rubber stamp for when my monocultural acquaintances get hacked.

@_subject: Reliance on Microsoft called risk to U.S. security 
There was a user (c. 1996) given a yes-no popup with "Self-destruct now ?"
and chose yes.
As a long-confirmed pessimist I see this as the call for mandatory access
controls.  I've no hope of making major improvements at work until either
we get some simple MAC or people get sacked for violating security policy.
And I think their attitudes are largely attibutable to a certain single-user
BTW I think any popup that steals the keyboard focus is unfriendly and
should be used for nothing short of a condition about to wreck the whole
machine.  I think for most tasks I'm interested in a GUI is unfriendly -
I'm not so extreme as to think it's never useful.

@_subject: Compression theory reference? 
Section 20.4 of
    Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling & Flannery
    Numerical Recipies in Fortran, 2nd Ed (1992)
    Cambridge University Press
    ISBN 0-521-43064-X
makes simple reading to this reader with minimal computer science
education incidental to a Physics course.  There are related
"Numerical Recipies" books using other computer languages.
The first paragraph on compression is (with *italics*):
  "A lossless data compression algorithm takes a string of symbols
   (typically ASCII characters or bytes) and translates it *reversibly*
   into another string, one that is *on the average* of shorter length.
   The words "on the average" are crucial; it is obvious that no reversible
   algorithm can make all strings shorter - there just aren't enough short
   strings to be in one-to-one correspondence with longer strings.
   Compression algorithms are possible only when, on the input side, some
   strings, or some input symbols, are more common than others.  These can
   then be encoded in fewer bits than rarer input strings or symbols,
   giving a net average gain."
There is 10.5 pages on compression and some further references I have
not read.

@_subject: Is finding security holes a good idea? 
In section 1 there's a crucial phrase not properly followed up:
    "significant opportunity cost since these researchers
     could be doing other security work instead of finding
     vulnerabilities".
What "other security work" is being used for comparison ?
    - finding and fixing non-program flaws (such as in configuration)
          I do a lot of this - and I'm not about to run out of it.
          I know that _finding_ the flaws is easy.  Even finding
          many of them systematically is easy.  Fixing them is
          often gets stuck on the problem of that's Fred's piece
          of work and he doesn't feel like doing it.
    - fixing long-known and neglected bugs (are there many ?)
    - accelerating patch uptake
    - technical work on tolerant architectures/languages etc
    - advocacy work on tolerant architectures/languages etc
          (Where's Howard Aitken when you need him ?)
    - forensics
    - other ?
Footnote 1 mentions an indirect effect of vulnerability research.
Another one would be programmer education - but reporting yet
another bug of a common type seems to have low value.  People
do need to be aware that (their!) software can be faulty and in
roughly what ways.
In 3.4 if proactive WHD is not worth the effort because the bugs
get discovered anyway when they are widely exploited what does
this say about finding vulnerabilities through their use in the
wild ? Is this more costly but better aimed at the bugs that matter ?
Are there cost-effective ways to do this reactive discovery ?  What
tools would simplify it ?
As mentioned in 8.4 the estimates of total cost bypass the incentive
to the participant.  A vendor/maintainer running his own code
is a special case because he might upgrade all his installations
before announcing a fix.
Don't worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good,
you'll have to ram them down people's throats. --Howard Aitken

@_subject: encrypted tapes 
The worst security audit point I have ever seen came from KPMG and
said that logging on as a particular non-root unix account got root
access, based on the "WARNING! YOU ARE SUPERUSER" message seen at login.
What they'd never done was check something like "sum /etc/shadow" to
see whether it was permitted or denied, nor run "id" or similar checks.
So when this user's home directory is absent and he ends up using
this message on the screen.  So where they should be writing
"misleading warning in some circumstances" they write "root access
immediately available for common users".
I'm planning to teach a class of 5 existing internal auditors
next month on some security s/w and I am going to include:
   - focussing on the more important stuff
     (a long-running problem where I work)
   - you must prove it before you can report it
   - you must be able to state what is wrong with the observed state;
     usually expressed as the policy point(s) violated
     (just appearing in scanner output is not enough)
   - you should have some idea of one way reasonable way to fix it

@_subject: The cost of online anonymity 
Assuming someone has come under suspicion in some other way and that they
continue to use a computer to view illegal material wouldn't the likes of
TEMPEST, hidden cameras and tampering with the suspect's software provide
all the computer-based evidence necessary ?
Combine that with a raid thats finds only one person in the house at the time
and what more do you need ?  I think it should be possible to debunk the idea
of lawlessness expressed in the article.
There is also this mail from (I think the same) Mr Sommer
    that mentions wider goals, but even these may be tackled to some extent
by observations like thoe above.   Especially (in the absence of Trusted Computing!)
and amended version of Freenet s/w that produces concealed logs.
I suppose some estimate of the number of "really nasty people", of Freenet users
and the cost of investigating this way would be good to have.

@_subject: can a random number be subject to a takedown? 
I'm as far from being a copyright lowyer as most of you.
I suppose that we mean a "randomly-generated number", rather than a "random number".
Then the production process would not be creative as expected for direct copyright
and you'd be right that it can't be copyrighted.
As far as the DMCA is concerned I think this is a paracopyright issue - the
(alleged) significance of the number in relation to HD-DVD would make it a
circumvention tool and therefore subject to takedowns.  I don't know whether an
alternative legitimate use is a defence, but you might have a job finding such
a thing for a randomly-generated number (as opposed to something more structured
like "Netscape engineers are weenies.").

@_subject: Decimal encryption 
Philipp G?hring wote:
English readers normally use "." as the decimal point - you had me confused
for a few seconds and maybe it wasn't only me.
Regardless of the calculated bit-equivalent you aren't storing these strings
in 132.877 bits - but possibly 40*8 bits, 40*4 bits or in some other way.
I don't think that's a feature of the encryption as such.
This sounds like possible confusion over block length and key size.  Then
you get involved in padding and storage of a slightly larger ciphertext.
It sounds as if you want a stream cipher arrangement that you could make
out of a normal binary stream cipher by:
   read a byte of the keystream
   if > 9 reject it and take the next one (aiming for uniform distribution)
   if the value is [0-9] add it to the current plaintext digit mod 10
