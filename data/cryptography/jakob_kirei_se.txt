I'm not sure what you mean with "no documented use of it" and I'm not sure why there is a need to add any FUD on this matter. If you have any questions or doubt regarding the m-of-n implementation and its use, I'm sure we can get the appropriate answers from the vendor.
The storage master key (SMK) used for key backup is protected by a 5 of 7 scheme. The activation key for  the HSM key material (aka AAK) is protected by a 3 of 7 scheme. This is all documented in the DPS.
There is no PIN for the SMK shares. The is a PIN for the AAK share, but as we have other security controls to manage the risks that the PIN would mitigate (remembering that the PIN itself introduces some issues as well), we choose to not use it (or rather; use a fixed, known PIN).
The above is actually the same very SMK, but the 2nd copy of the SMK shares (the one used for transporting the key material from the east to the west coast) was destroyed as part of the ceremony at the west coast (where the key from the east coast where restored). The 2nd copy of the SMK was generated using a 2 of 4 scheme.
The couriered key material was indeed under the same control/audit scrutiny as the rest of the procedures, is was documented both in writing and by video. Anyone in doubt of what happened, how data was transported and what controls were in place to detect tampering and/or other threats, are more than welcome to contact me and I will try to answer any questions.
We'd be happy to learn from your experience in this matter and will listen carefully to any feedback from the community. But before submitting comments, I do urge people to review the key ceremonies that took place on the east and west coast (audit material is available online at

With the assistance of the vendor (or their employees), it would be possible to reassemble the storage master key (SMK) by combining 5 of 7 key shares, then decrypting the key backup. There is nothing in the HSM units itself that is needed for a key restore.
The value that is split is the SMK, used to encrypt the actual key. The actual key is not split and, once in production, is never to be transported outside the ICANN Key Management Facility.
Aha, that's why Vint was so on top of things during the East Coast key ceremony :-)
In this case, the SMK == the tamper key.

Initial bootstrap is done by
- distribution of the key by ICANN (via - distribution of the key by the vendors themselves
Authentication of the root key can be achieved as part of the the distribution mechanisms above, or by transitive trust through people who attended the key generation ceremony. We've already seen public attestations from participants (e.g., [1], [2] and [3]).
Key rollovers are performed as specified in RFC 5011, i.e. a new key is authenticated by the current key. This does of course not work when the existing private key material is inaccessible (on form of "lost"). It could work if the key is "lost" by compromise, but one has to take into consideration how the key was compromised in such cases (key misuse, crypto analysis, etc).
For the generic end user, I would expect vendors to ship the root key as part of their software and keep the key up to date using their normal software update scheme.

@_subject: towards https everywhere and strict transport security (was: Has there been a change in US banking regulations recently?) 
There are a lot of work going on in this area, including how to use secure DNS to associate the key that appears in a TLS server's certificate with the the intended domain name [1]. Adding HSTS to this mix does make sense and is something that is discussed, e.g. on the keyassure mailing list [2].

Thierry, do you know of anyone that configured the DURZ DNSKEY and accepted the signature validation failure resulting because of this? We had good (documented) reasons for deploying the DURZ as we did, the deployment was successful and it is now all water under the bridge. Adding FUD at this time does not help.
Yes, they are - see  If there is anything missing, please let me know.
The key material was couriered between the Key Management Facilities by ICANN staff members. I'd be happy to make sure you get answers to any questions you may have regarding this handling.
Yes, please read the DPS - Jakob Schlyter

The DNS root key is stored in HSMs. The key backups (maintained by ICANN) are encrypted with a storage master key (SMK), created inside the HSM and then split among 7 people (aka "Recovery Key Share Holders"). To recover the SMK in case of all 4 HSMs going bad, 5 of 7 key shares are required. ( section 5.2.4)
According to the FIPS 140-2 Security Policy of the HSM, an AEP Keyper, the M-of-N key split is done using a La Grange interpolating Polynomial.
I'd be happy to answer any additional questions,
