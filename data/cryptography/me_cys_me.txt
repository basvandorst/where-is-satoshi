@_subject: [Cryptography] Security clearances and FOSS encryption? 
It should be clear by now from the conversation that holding a security clearance doesn't in general qualify or disqualify someone from working on FOSS.
There are a lot of scenarios. A small number involve bad behavior by someone with a clearance, but we don't necessarily know if a person has a clearance. If someone intentionally subverts a FOSS project as their job representing an intelligence agency, then the agent isn't going to be bragging about security clearances. At least, a competent agent won't.
In any case, it comes down to a single solution - assurance through multi-person control. Teamwork for system maintenance, teamwork for code review, teamwork for everything. Human error and incompetence are bigger risks, and we can reduce the risks with the same mechanism.

I don't believe a disclosure would be effective. We're essentially asking, "Do you expect to be recruited by an intelligence agency to subvert our FOSS crypto project's integrity?" People won't necessarily know ahead of time if they are candidates to be chosen for such a task, and their managers might not know, either. It also DOES NOT MATTER if the person holds a personal security clearance or not. An agency might easily ask someone to do something like this without requiring a clearance. Yes, there are clearances galore if someone is an "officer" of an intelligence agency. But the grunt spies who get recruited to do the work may or may not have clearances. There's another whole question of how an intelligence agency would penetrate a FOSS crypto project, and whether they'd bother involving any actual participants. Given the terrific state of cyber security, I suspect most agencies would just penetrate remotely and anonymously, and manipulate the change files.

Could you explain why you say this?
Of course.
Do FOSS projects only admit participants whose identities can be verified? Or can they be vouched by previously trusted participants? (Transitivity again). Should we argue that people who keep elements of their life private shouldn't be trusted to participate in FOSS projects?
Is source code subversion a "novel attack vector" for FOSS projects? I thought it was a generally recognized one for all software development today. I acknowledge that there are novel ways to subvert crypto. It might be easier to do and harder to detect.

I think our discussion is getting a little muddy: some authors are using "security clearance" when they really mean "employment" by a government agency (directly or as a contractor, including military and intel organizations).
The security clearance is a side-effect of one's employment. And let me remind everyone, again, that you don't need a clearance or any public form of government employment in order to be a spy, confidential informant, or agent provocateur.

And so, let me ask the community: is it a common practice in the FOSS community to produce a detailed dossier on all participants, or is participation based on the contributor's visible established net cred as a developer?
I suspect it?s the latter but I have no idea what the general practice might be.

Does anyone appreciate the irony?
If we wish to exclude people with security clearances from FOSS projects, we need our own process for doing background checks. If the person passes the background check, we issue our own security clearance to work on our project.
Is this what the FOSS community is going to want?
I'd like us to recall earlier discussions - we can't predict which contributors are going to try to subvert our software, even with background checks. How do we cope? The same way we cope with other flaws in the code: we review, test, repeat.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Why is ECC secure? 
I want to thank Bill Cox for taking the time to ask his question, and especially thank those of you who took the time to point at detailed failures in his suggestion. Iâm largely self-taught in the higher math related to this, and these colloquial discussions make it easier for me to understand the textbook descriptions.

The thing looks like it was never unpacked. The colored plastic in the power supply looks surprising. Could it be a reproduction? Iâd be inclined to buy an affordable reproduction. A quarter of a million is too rich for my taste. The seller also has a Hagelin B-21 for a mere $98k. Both are amazingly well preserved, if original.

@_subject: [Cryptography] NSA Releases 21 Oral History Interviews 
Maybe I’m too interested in stuff from the past, but I’m enjoying those oral histories. I haven’t found any surprising nuggets, though it’s interesting to hear about ‘30s security discipline in cryptanalysis: the work really didn’t exist unless you were involved somehow.

@_subject: [Cryptography] The Laws (was the principles) of secure 
For comparison, take a look at this article:
 … which looks at various attempts to codify security design principles. It’s a long version of an IEEE S&P article from 12/2012. The article starts with Saltzer and Schroeder’s list(s) developed during the Multics project. The online version includes a lot of less-interesting detail about  national and international attempts to draft a ‘complete’ list in the late ‘90s. The efforts eventually burned out with few satisfactory results. Personally, I see no point to drafting a master list of principles. Such lists can be useful for specific things - my textbook has a list of principles, but it’s purely a pedagogical tool and not an engineering tool. A particular software engineering project might draft a list of principles to use within the project - one that focuses on the main issues facing the project team. A useful list has to be short and pithy. A ‘complete’ list will be too long. It will also hit different levels of abstraction, making it really hard for different people to interpret.
Just my two cents.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Binary security (was The Laws of secure 
It’s pointless to write a principle or “law” or whatever claiming “Security is binary."
If the meaning of of a pithy principal isn’t blatantly obvious from its text, it’s badly worded.
A handful of us have had the dubious distinction of working with “formal proofs of security” in which security is considered a binary state. The trick is to define security so narrowly that it is a binary condition that is also provable. You throw out a lot of threats when you do this. The answer to “Is it secure” becomes “Yes, but..” and you have to explain all the exceptions and conditions.

Compare this to the digital rights management problem. MPAA members would love to identify which movies are being pirated, and by whom. Same with counterintelligence folk identifying leakers. Rick.

Perhaps I?m overanalyzing, but it doesn?t look like his writing style, nor do those words look like ones he?d use. If someone on his staff provided this as something to talk about, why? And how did they get 45 to think it worthy of a tweet?

I know that LastPass has a password sharing mechanism that would meet these requirements. Other password managers may also have them. It’s a matter of setting up sharing groups to comply with your goals. I’m disappointed though not surprised that some financial software forces end users to share passwords, even though sharing weakens security and accountability.

I have to wonder how this relationship played with the Five Eyes. They have to have either known or suspected it. If they suspected it, then they no doubt tried to exploit it.
