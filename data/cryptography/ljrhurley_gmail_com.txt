For what it's worth, a group at MIT seems to be actively developing cryptdb, which is an SQL implementation that emulates homomorphic encryption. There's a mailing list that, up until I unsubscribed, had a low S/N ratio, but that had seemed to be changing. As such, it may be an interesting place to get implementation advice.
Google brings up a list of academic papers on the design itself (I seem to recall it starting as dissertation work) so that may be helpful as well.

Using the original implementation by Gentry, the system has to
do the equivalent of a clean-up operation after performing the
operation, before another operation can be performed. This:
refers to the clean-up (I believe, stolen from wikipedia, but it seems
to confirm what I recall). There's a niggling thought that there's some
latitude (maybe 3 or 4) in number of operations, obviously depending on
how much noise is introduced with each operation and the power of the
noise removal. So while plausible to chain this into a complex machine
(like something to completely compute your taxes), I presume the
overhead would start to really hit efficiency if you were trying to do
something like keeping the books of a large company. That said, I know
Paillier's public key system used homomorphic encryption, so I suppose
it all depends on what the desired end state is. Other than reading
Gentry's thesis a couple of years ago though, I haven't really kept pace
with this area.
