From a lawyer's perspective, it seems worrying that a message into which the word "not" has been inserted might still have the same hash as the original (assuming the hash to be a component of an electronic signature)

@_subject: [Fwd: Re: Non-repudiation (was RE: The PAIN mnemonic)] 
In the UK, but not in other countries, there is a statutory rule which prevents a bank from debiting a customer's account with a forged cheque (if you will forgive the British spelling), with only very limited exceptions.  If the customer repudiates a signature, it is for the bank to prove the genuineness of the signature, or suffer the loss.
My bank has once or twice telephoned to check the genuineness of an unusual transaction, though this over a period of many years.
This is not to disagree with your comments, but to observe that existing paper systems can work satisfactorily without non-repudiation rules.  There are obvious advantages to some parties in such systems if it adopts a non-repudiation rule, probably matched with corresponding disadvantages for others.  The change from paper to electronic systems of course also alters the balance of risks and the approach of banks to non-repudiation rules.
I and colleagues have written about this at:

@_subject: authentication and authorization (was: Question on the state 
Subsequent posters have doubted the wisdom of quibbling with the term "identity theft".  I think the terminology deserves some attention of its own.
There is a long-established term, "impersonation", which is wholly adequate to describe what is now called "identity theft".  Is this just a change of fashion?  I suggest that there is more to the change.
"Impersonation" as a term focuses attention on the fact that the criminal is deceiving someone in order to gain advantage by claiming to have some valuable characteristics or authorisations in fact belonging not to the criminal but to some other person.  The person deceived is the primary victim in contemplation when this terminology is used.
"Identity theft", by contrast, suggests that the victim is the person impersonated, because his or her "identity" has been "stolen".
This way of looking at things implies that the losses which arise out of the impersonation fall on the person impersonated, rather than on the person deceived by the impersonation.
"Identity theft" as a label is attractive to, for example, banks who may wish to suggest that losses must be carried by their customers because they failed to take proper care of their "identity".
I think the use of the term "identity theft" should alert us to the risk that victims of crime are trying to pass the blame and the loss to someone else.

I do.
My bank provides an RSA SecureId, so I feel reasonably safe against
anyone other than the bank.  I have no basis for knowing how good the
bank's precautions against insider fraud are, but they phone back to
confirm unusual instructions, and they ask for only fragments of
passwords when they do, so there is evidence that they make sensible
efforts to do the right thing.
I have been a good customer for more than 30 years, it's a highly
respectable specialist bank, I am a lawyer, and if I find a fake
transaction on my account I believe I stand a good chance of fighting
it.  I know who to hire as an expert to investigate the bank's system
when I have put it in issue in litigation.  The aggregate of my balance
and my credit limit is an amount I can afford to lose.
In this context the convenience of online banking is enough to justify
the risk.

That depends on how the risk of loss is allocated.  This can vary
between different legal systems, and may depend on the terms in force
between bank and customer.

@_subject: the effects of a spy 
Of historical interest on this question there is useful material in
"Between Silk and Cyanide" by Leo Marks.
Marks was responsible for ciphers used during WWII by SOE for
communications with agents in German occupied Europe.  He describes an
episode when he was visited by people from Bletchley Park who were
concerned that he was equipping agents with ciphers that (he deduced)
were too strong for Bletchley Park to attack if they should fall into
German hands and come into use by them.
It is understandable, particularly during the Battle of the Atlantic,
that UK priorities should have been to maintain the availability of
breaks into enemy traffic even at the risk of hazarding communications
with agents.  (If Britain had failed in the Atlantic the war in the west
would have been over.  If SOE failed, there were no short-term
consequences of similar seriousness.)
The preservation of secrecy about those breaks for nearly thirty years
after the end of the war suggests that those priorities may have become
ossified, which may in turn account for excessive governmental anxieties
over the spread of strong cryptography.  Any change in these priorities
would be of great interest.

@_subject: Interesting bit of a quote 
Another example, possibly of some importance, is found in registers of
births, marriages and deaths.  Details of the relevant events were
entered contemporaneously in local paper ledgers whose pages were
numbered.  (They were later, perhaps every quarter, copied to central
registers.)  As a result it was very difficult to create a backdated
record, or remove an original one, without it being obvious.  When
registers consist of electronic databases, these natural protections
silently disappear.  They could be replaced, perhaps by publishing an
authenticated hash of the register every week, and cumulative hashes
periodically; but there is no sign of such methods being adopted.
The Law Society of England and Wales suggested to the Land Registry that
it should adopt some such methods for its electronic land registers,
especially when the transactions recorded in the registers become
electronic rather than paper transactions, as is planned.  I have no
reason to think this suggestion will take root.

@_subject: crypto component services - is there a market? 
When I was in business in the UK (until last year) (as a VAT-registered
individual) I issued electronic invoices when convenient to my clients.
I found no general requirement for any signature, let alone a qualified
electronic one; I had a professional obligation to sign invoices, which
I met by the inclusion of a graphic of a handwritten signature.
Invoices were dated and copies kept, but there was no requirement for
time-stamping or any particular evidence of date of delivery.
I received and continue to receive electronic invoices from time to
time, but none appear to be digitally signed, nor have I seen evidence
of time-stamping in operation.

I too do not know how the UK has dealt with implementation - the
Directive seems to require Member States to accept electronic invoices
under the prescribed conditions, but does not prevent them from
accepting electronic invoices even without such conditions.
My impression, from practical experience of advice given by the UK VAT
authorities, is that electronic invoicing in the UK does not require any
special guarantees of authenticity or integrity.

In the UK Part III of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 - see  - includes powers for certain classes of officials to require encrypted materials to be decrypted or to require a key to be provided.  There are some safeguards, regarded by some as insufficient.
The powers have not yet been brought into force, but the Government intends to bring them into force in the near future.
The powers are of course wholly ineffectual where perfect forward secrecy obtains, are of limited value in relation to ephemeral encrypted communications where keys are (or may plausibly be claimed to be) changed frequently or lost, but may be of some real value in relation to encrypted storage media where key preservation, with or without key recovery mechanisms, will obviously be important to most users.

I've never been quite sure whether "Public" qualifies "Key" or
"Infrastructure" - this may make a difference to what you count as a PKI.
SWIFT (interbank messaging), BOLERO (bills of lading) and CREST (dealing
in dematerialised stocks and shares) all use public key cryptography, I
believe, and have all been reasonably successful; but they are all
closed systems where each of the participants believes that it and the
others can stand the risk of contractually-imposed non-repudiation rules
(or they used to believe it, anyway).
But what these examples illustrate, by the lack of "open" comparables,
is the very limited utility of the technology.

My experience was the same, although I needed some initial help with GPG.  Since then, updates have been trouble-free.
My only problem with the security model is that Thunderbird/Enigmail stores encrypted messages in encrypted form, and there is no option to store the plaintext.  This use of a communications key for stored data is potentially a nuisance - a key corruption or other compromise, or just a wish to delete an old key for forward security, would cause much trouble.  (I keep my mail in an encrypted container anyway, so don't need this feature.)
This apart, the system runs with remarkable simplicity.

@_subject: Property RIghts in Keys 
A private key is obviously meant to be kept secret, and commercial
secrets are commonly protected as trade secrets (US terminology) or as
benefiting from the law about confidentiality (UK terminology).  The
right to have the secret kept is capable of being seen as a form of
intangible property (though whether it is useful to call it
"intellectual" seems to be contentious to some).
Forms of certificate seem to be fairly standard, and not many CAs would
have much chance of proving that they originated and owned the form they
use.  Creativity requirements vary quite widely between legal systems.
The UK requirement is not high: "originality" requires primarily that
the work originated from the author, not that it required artistic
input.  A cryptographic key should certainly satisfy that requirement.
Copyright seems to be what GeoTrust has in mind in licensing
reproduction of the certificates.
A nice example of how lawyers can effectively undermine their CA
clients' claims to be adding value.

In responding to what Steven M. Bellovin wrote about GeoTrust, I
mentioned the low UK copyright law requirement for creativity.
As a postscript to that observation, I draw attention to s9(3) of the UK
Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988:
(3) In the case of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work which
is computer-generated, the author shall be taken to be the person by
whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work are undertaken.
And s178 provides the definition:  "computer-generated", in relation to
a work, means that the work is generated by computer in circumstances
such that there is no human author of the work.
These provisions seem to me to work quite aptly to encompass a key-pair.

The semantics of signing a PGP key are indeed obscure.  It seems
regrettable that there is no way for the signer to spell what the
signature is intended to mean.
Backing up one step, what are the semantics of publishing a public key?
What is being promised about the relationship between the publisher and
either the signatures that it can verify or the scope of access to
messages which it is used to encrypt?
If a public key is published on a web page controlled by the publisher,
it can be used to spell this out.  My own attempt appears with the key
(see the link below).
