 answering number two, DH = Diffie-Hellman, DSS = Digital Signature
 The method for signaturing is utilizing discrete logarithm problems, versus
RSA factoring problems.
DSS is the NIST standard for DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm).
DSS was selected by NIST, in cooperation with the NSA  to be the digital
authentication standard of the U.S. government.

@_subject: Diffie-Hellman 128 bit 
I am looking at attacks on Diffie-Hellman.
The protocol implementation I'm looking at designed their diffie-hellman
using 128 bit primes (generated each time, yet P-1/2 will be a prime, so no
go on pohlig-hellman attack), so what attacks are there that I can look at
to come up with either the logarithm x from (a=g^x mod p) or the session key
that is
calculated. A brute force wouldn't work, unless I know the starting range.
Are there any realistic
attacks on DH parameters of this size, or is theoretically based on
financial computation attacks?
Thanks for your time.

Nope, it uses 128 bit primes. I'm trying to compute the discrete logarithm
and they are staying within a 128 bit GF(p) field. Sickening.

Well, I'm attacking a protocol, I know the rules of DH parameters, and the
issue here is I'm trying to solve x, brute forcing that in the 128 bit range
can be difficult, and x doesn't have to be a prime. (a = g^x mod P). Their
primes are 128 bit primes, as well as their pubkeys, I've done some tests on
their prime, and all perform under this method of (p-1)/2 = prime. This
eliminates the pohlig-hellman discrete logarithm attack, but I'm trying to
learn the Gaussian integer method.

So far, as I see it, this is not an issue of specific SSL protocol, but of
unrestrictive browser to user interfacing. The only MITM attacks that have
been practical valid attacks as of lately were specific to microsoft browser
issues when interfacing with SSL. On another note, MITM attacks on SSL, is
strictly a user education issue. How many users know what a fingerprint is,
or what it is designed for? Unless we either force the browser to be that
strict and never interface with unseen  or untrusted fingerprints
(impractical), what can you do?

Correct. On the other hand, in a lot of cases people cannot be expected
to do the verification. This shows in the number of people that can be
tricked into being spoofed out of their passwords, even when
certificates are deployed. That is not an argument against certificates
though, it is (partially) an argument against broken user interfaces.
What makes you say it is gratuitous? Or: how can you state my privacy
is gratuitous?
This is illogical. Even if a server operator would prefer to allow
unauthenticated encryption, he cannot do so without annoying 90% of his
customers because they too will be getting these alarming messages. In
general, if my browsing privacy is important to me and the server
operator is willing to accomodate me, he cannot do so.
This however still does not constitute an argument against
certificates. It can be morphed as an argument against browsers not
supporting Anonymous-DH. (Note that I'm favoring treating sites
offering ADH the same as sites offering a certificate. Each offers
different functionality which should be distinguishable in the GUI.)

Their is another bug that has not been fixed by MS that allows signed but
invalid certificates to be used to MITM the browser as well with no
