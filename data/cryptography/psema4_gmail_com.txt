The closest I've found is "A freestart collision is a collision where
the attacker can choose the initialisation vector."
Source: In the Damgard-Merkle construction for hash functions the compression
function takes as input:
* a message block and
* a chaining value.
For the very first block there is not previous "chaining value".
Instead a particular value, called an initialisation vector (IV) is
A freestart collision is a collision where the attacker can choose the IV.
