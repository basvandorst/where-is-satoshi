If the bootloader is running on malicious hardware I don't think that
test can be trusted. :(

I can certainly imagine various countries legislating such backdoors,
and other countries quietly installing them (assuming they aren't
already there for Skype).  And that will certainly help in catching
some fraction of unsophisticated crooks.
But botnets-for-rent are currently making pretty substantial amounts
of money (eg for sending spam, or ddos attacks, or as phishing hosts),
and are increasingly using professionally written malware.
Given the lure of this much "easy money", I think it's much more
likely that the cleverer bad guys will just wrap an un-backdoored ssh
or ssl or ipsec or  layer inside the backdoored one(s), giving them (continued)
full security.  For better or worse, I think the "bad buys can use
strong crypto" horse left the barn a long time ago.
I don't see your point -- surely once a machine is "recruited" into
a botnet, the botnet herder can and does load any software s/he wants
onto the "new recruit".
In what way has this stopped (or even slowed) the Storm worm,
to name one notorious example?
