The paper only talks about prime-field discrete log, meaning classic DH and DSA (not ECDH or ECDSA).  This was suggested in 1992, but the new paper appears to be able to hide the backdoor better — perhaps so well that nobody can find it.
For RSA, the person who generated the primes is the one who’s supposed to read your message anyway.  If they want Eve to be able to read the message, they can just give her the key.  It’s also not difficult to exfiltrate an encrypted seed of the key in the key itself.
For ECC, this sort of back door has been suggested many times, but nobody (publicly) knows if it’s possible to build it.

You could send the params as a seed S where P = some agreed xof(S).  This at least limits the classes of weak Ps that can arise.  It would even save bandwidth.  But if you aren’t using pre-agreed parameters, you will have to check that P is prime.  This takes several times as long as DH itself.

@_subject: [Cryptography] HSMs or Intel SGX? Which is harder to hack? 
The image of 10,000 smart card readers dangling out of your host gives me a chuckle.
Unfortunately, I’m not up to date on what all the certifications mean, but it is independent security analyses and certifications that you will want to look at.
Yeah, FIPS 140-2 means little, and CC depends on what level.
I’m not sure.  It’s supposed to be hard, but I’ve never looked closely at the evaluation of such HSMs.  There certainly are shoddy HSMs on the market, which leak their secrets (presumably accidentally) through radio emissions.  I’d look carefully at what the certifications claim.
Overall, it should be significantly harder to extract the key from a high-quality HSM than from SGX, because SGX is not designed to resist side channels at all.  Furthermore, to have even minimal resistance to side channels, you’d have to write a power analysis resistant enclave, which would be somewhat annoying.
However, you often can’t program an HSM with your business logic.  If the host is compromised and an attacker can sign data of his choice, then you might not be getting the security you want.  I guess in principle you could even log into the HSM from an SGX enclave with your business logic, but maybe at that point you’re just being silly.

Hello Crypto list,
I’m curious about quantum solutions to a variant of search.
Suppose I have a distribution D on the interval [0,1], and a function F(seed) which samples from D using a random oracle.
An adversary wants to find seeds such that F(seed) is large, and in particular wants to write a quantum algorithm that maximizes the expectation of F(seed).
If the distribution is only supported on the endpoints {0,1}, then this is just search and Grover is known to be optimal.  With t quantum oracle evaluations, it produces expectation something like min(1, t^2 * pr(1)).
But what if it’s not just {0,1}?  Grover can still be applied, just by setting a cutoff x and searching for seeds where F(seed) > x.  But is this optimal, or is there some kind of “fuzzy Grover’s algorithm” that improves on it?

A follow-on to this: it can be shown that the cutoff+grover approach cannot do better than root-mean-square(distribution).
Proof: Let c be the cutoff, and p be pr(x > cutoff).  With O(sqrt(1/p)) work, the adversary will obtain a sample which is > cutoff with high probability.  Its distribution is then
sum_(x in D, x > cutoff) x * pr(x)/p
Here pr(x)/p sums to 1 by definition of p.  By the power means inequality, the sum is less than or equal to sqrt( sum_(x in D, x > cutoff) x^2 * pr(x) / p )
with equality if there is only one value above the cutoff.  Computing the ratio of expectation to work, the sqrt(p) cancels leaving
sqrt( sum_(x in D, x > cutoff) x^2 * pr(x) )
This is at most root-mean-square(D), with equality iff there are no nonzero values less than the cutoff.  Thus, the best you can do is RMS(D), with equality iff the distribution takes on at most one nonzero value, in which case it’s just Grover search.
I still don’t know better if there’s a better algorithm than cutoff+Grover, but it does seem reasonable to hope that you can’t generically do better than RMS(D).
