No one is saying you do.
Sure.  There are many examples of this kind of generator,
using physical sources from video'd lava lamps to radioactive decay
(incl. semiconductor junctions, resistors, microphone, detuned FM radio cards).  And there are many examples of output-whitening hash functions; SHA-1 is reasonable in this case.
The thread here has split into "QM & True Randomness" and "what do you need to build a true RNG"...
You can't vet a RNG by looking at its output, which is likely
whitened anyway, but you can gain confidence by looking at its design and measuring the entropy in the raw-physical-source derived bitstream.
If the raw source has < 1 bits/symbol (and it will), it'd be nice if a
later stage
distilled this to near 1 bit/symbol, before whitening.  Of course, no one
outside the box will know, since you're whitening, but it yields resistance
to (albeit difficult) attacks (e.g., your hash turns out to be attackable). I also fail to see harm in measuring/monitoring entropy as the RNG operates.

Yes, it is a joke.  However, it is also a viable if low-bandwidth
entropy source.  I disagree that you need to be able to model
the lava (etc) well enough to give a lower bound on the entropy.
(Though its nice if you have such a model).  You should be able
to use any source which you know is not a PRNG as the entropy-source
in a true RNG.  You should be able to use entropy (and stat tests)
to measure the source entropy after digitization.
The "lava" could turn out to Yes, thus the humor.
So work in a Faraday cage...
The advantage of a microphone, I suppose, is that you can
hear any jamming attempts..
Its a joke/hack of the 'finesse' form.. You can imagine simple-hashing (irreversible compression) as distinct from whitening which is
related to cryptographic strength, avalanche, mixing, etc.
Source --> Digitizer --> Simple hash --> Whitener (e.g., DES)
In this view, SHA combines the compression (aka digestion) function with the crypto-strength whitening
You collect some representative raw data, and run a number of entropy measurements on that sample.  You find < 1bit/baud.
You run the data through an algorithm which produces fewer bits.
You measure the entropy of the result.  When successive (or
'stronger') runs measure at 1b/bd, you have distilled
entropy from that sample.  To use this in crypto, you'd
put it through a whitener --feed blocks to DES-- for
belts-and-suspenders assurance.  And because you don't
want someone "looking through" your simple-hashing logic
back to your source.
Once you put it through DES, anything (eg the integers) appears random.
That's why you measure before whitening, if possible.  If
you use SHA you can only measure the input entropy and make
sure you hash enough bits down to produce your output stream.
Since utter crap coming in will look perfectly white coming out.
You measure because your model may have overlooked something.
I agree with the first statement (by definition), I think in crypto you have
to be dubious (paranoid?) of the second.
So the adversary can't look back into your logic.  A 'distiller'
which produces quality entropy (after digesting an arbitrary
number of bits) needn't be as opaque as a crypto-secure hash is.
That's a fine implementation.  Others may wish to separate
the phases (e.g., hardware to do simple-hashing can be high-speed
on the entropy-source-side, and feed slower crypto-hashing (whitening) logic on the other side).  But using software to distill your entropy its
easy enough to run a few more iters.  And there are very few users of high
bandwidth entropy.
No one outside the box can tell the difference between simply
hashed 'noise' and crypto-hashed 'noise'.  Or between those
and a long-sequence PRNG.
Now, if the adversary knows things about your simple-distiller, he
may be able to use that.  If a whitener protects that logic,
he can't see into the distiller.  If the whitener (your SHA) is broken (eg analytically) then its transparent to the adversary.   You could, if you worried
about SHA geting broken, put a structurally different whitener after that.
Yet like snowflakes they are all unique :-) Sure, a low-voltage light will alarm faster than an entropy test,
since the latter needs a window of samples to look at.  But gross monitors won't detect drift, ADC codes that drop out over time, etc.  Particularly if you go directly into a function
whose output will look white even if an input bit changes

Good question.  I'd say the answer depends on the computational requirements
of "compression" vs. SHA, assuming you're trying to save CPU cycles.
You can measure the entropy of your camera staring at a wall and use that
to estimate how much you need to digest.  Then add a generous engineering
of course.
Here's the type of experiment I've done, which separates the
bit-digestion from the crypto-hashing: Once you measure entropy in your raw data, you can put the data sample through
various distillers.  For instance, xor pairs of bits, reducing the
sample size by 2.  Measure the entropy of this.  Keep doing this
until your entropy-measure says you've maxxed out.
Then, to truly mess with Mr. Adversary, put it through a crypto function
(which here needn't be a digest, e.g., a block cipher).
The latter step achieves the 'mixing' (avalanche) which is built into SHA.  For a software implementation SHA seems like a good choice, though
you don't get to measure the entropy distillation before whitening.

Not wasting entropy does not mean that a function's output is "white" ie uniformly distributed.  E.g., a function which doubles every bit: 0->00, 1->11 preserves total
entropy but does not produce uniformly distributed output.
(It also reduces entropy/symbol.)
The simple-hash's --lets call it a digest-- function is to increase the
by *reducing* the number of symbols while preserving *total* entropy.
A function like xor(bit N, bit N+1) which halves the number of bits
can do this.  While its output is whiter than its input, its output will not be perfectly white unless its input was.  The crypto-whitener produces perfectly uniform output.  It also hides the analog source and digest's regularities.  Yes, your bit-reducing function (parity-over-N-bits) is particularly
for your raw source (constrained parity-over-M bits) for M=N.  Pick a
This discussion has made things clearer on this end, too.
I better understand what SHA does in RNGs that use it.
Two scenarios where SHA is contraindicated came up: 1. hardware
2. interrupt handlers
Sometimes a hardware RNG will feed raw data into a crypto-WEAK analogue of
ie a LFSR which does the bit-reduction and mixing functions, but doesn't mix as well as SHA.  (LFSR are hardware-friendly)  Separating
the bit-reduction from the mixing can be useful for analyzing what's
really going on.

A change in the analogue threshold of your digitizing step
will change the variability (aka entropy) of your samples.
The practical solution is wide engineering margins and monitor
your raw input.  (And, if you can (SHA users can't), measure the data just before it goes into any whiteners you use, for belts-and-suspenders assurance that you've compressed it sufficiently.)
Based on a detailed model of the noise, grounded in physics.
Have you seen RNGs based on arrival times of network packets,
or disk accesses, etc.?  I'd extrapolate that you'd not trust
them much given their distance from physics.  (And I'd
agree that a soundcard (or RF card) is preferred and 'free')
I don't think "collision" is the right word; you're not doing
a search on hash values which might "collide".
For example, if I have 165 bits
I don't understand this.  If you have 165 bits of entropy in, you should be
able to generate 160 binary symbols with a bit of entropy each.
(You are conserving total entropy, only concentrating it by reducing
the number of symbols.)
Shifting thresholds changes entropic content.
DC doesn't matter, capacitors are cheap :-) This hinges on the definition of "large" and "small"... anyway
generous margins & monitoring work both for steel bridges and RNGs.

@_subject: anonymous DH & MITM 
Think of an "identity" is one endpoint of a communication link.
Identities can have varying degrees of persistance
and varying degrees of association with meatspace/bank accounts.
These are orthogonal dimensions.
An endpoint can maintain a reputation (persistant "identity")
but need not be linked to meatspace entity.  A nom-de-plume
is a traditional example.
By itself, DH exchange only assures that the endpoints
remain constant (plus, via the typical symmetric key
exchange, also provides confidentiality) for the session.
If there is a MITM, the endpoints are not what the
distal endpoints (Alice & Bob) might think.
RSA-certs as administered by Verislime have very little
meatspace linkage --you can't sue Verislime if their
signed-claims about a meatspace entity are untrue, and
the certholder ran off with your money, or if the cert was copied and your DNS cache poisoned.
Similarly, publishing a RSA public key and email address
does not guarantee anything.  And since trust is *not*
transitive, the so-called "web of trust" does little
to help, because your personally trusted associates may have
been compromised.
And of course single meatspace entities may have several RSA
keys which others do not know have a common user.

It should be, but usually isn't.  In fact, the security
dude often has to make recommendations out of his
prescribed niche, to others.  Often on a project which
is already under way.
E.g., I recently contracted to implement a crypto protocol.
When I suggested that, if a pad of paper be provided for
folks to write their passphrases down, it be a single glass-backed sheet (lest impressions be taken), much
laughter ensued.  But if its worth encrypting, it must
be interesting, right?   Security is much more than crypto, I've learned, so I don't have a problem with the word.  Security includes
human and physical security, and although they're not
cool comp sci or math, they are vital.  Crypto being
fairly refined, its not the weakest link any more.  And a 'security'
mindset (being able to think like the adversary, much
like in tic-tac-toe or chess) is important, but not
so common.
Its not like things titled "crypto" aren't often marianated in snake oil...

Since then I've learned that other things are more important to understand; crypto components are just black boxes to an engineer, like a sorting routine or the like.
Cryptoplumber is cute, in a self-depreciating way, but
its all engineering, albeit less mature than say civil

Humans, generally.  Also the infrastructure under your

With the exception of perhaps security-focussed

bugs whereas contributing a package of functionality

A good idea, but also: consider that hardware based RNGs are
not so hard to make.  An FM radio soundcard, audio digitizer, and
some homebrew (perhaps standard-crypto-hash-based) software
suffices for moderate bandwidth true RNG construction.  Using an evaluation metric like Diehard and/or a Shannon or
Mauer entropy measure ices the cake (as well as being required
for initial and continuing monitoring).  (Insert the usual caveats
about PRNGs being undetectable, OS subversion, white vans driving
your FM hiss, etc.)  Very cheap and if you can master a hash
function component, not tricky.
Obviously too much trouble for Joe Sixpack, but I think that
certain online gambling houses (not US of course) have made
their own sources, and definately not too hard for anyone who codes
and has crypto-clue.  OTOH Joe can benefit from his radio-tuner
card plus off the shelf inspectable software since he ought not
to trust Bigcorp's embedded nominal RNG.  Joe Sixpack might also
be an abbreviation for a foreign government.  Should the Pakis
really trust Intel's RNG? PS: your belts and suspenders argument also applies to trusting
cipher algorithms.  Best to chain a few.  Also useful to twiddle
a few S-box bits, even if you get suboptimal properties, so as to deter cheap crackers using COTS cipher chips.  (Doing dictionary
regexp search, not the impractical exhaustive search, of course.)
This works particularly well in large random-S-box constructs like Blowfish

Interestingly, either anonymity or encryption is sufficient to distribute naughty bits.  If they can't link them to you, or if they can't tell what you're getting, you have used anonymity or crypto-confidentiality correctly.
Anonymity is more than crypto ( == provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication ) because you need traffic-analysis resistance (routing confidentiality) which is harder.  If Tor was perfect you could exchange plaintext naughty bits though.
Of course they work best together: as anonymous as possible and encrypt all traffic (lest encrypted traffic draw suspicion, lest naughty plaintext interest traffic analysts).
Both of these annoy the herd-managers...
