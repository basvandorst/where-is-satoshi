Dear Allen,
What you're losing is collision resilience. For a more detailed
discussion please see our recent paper "EdDSA for more curves", page 5,
paragraph "Security notes on prehashing":

@_subject: [Cryptography] More efficient and just as secure to sign 
Dear Allen, dear all,
Please note that Ed25519 is not just simply "hashing with MD5 twice".
I have the impression that there are two aspects of EdDSA that get
confused in this discussion: the issue of pre-hashing (and losing
collision resilience) and the issue of deterministic signing (which
requires the two hash computations). The two hashes computed for Ed25519 signing are
1.) r = H(h_b,...,h_{2b-1},M) and
2.) H(R,A,M)
Instead of computing the first hash, one *could* pick r as a uniformly
random scalar modulo the group order l. This is in fact what Schnorr
signatures (and similarly ECDSA signatures) do. However, then the
security of the scheme then largely depends on the RNG, which is outside
the scope of testing of the signature scheme. Also, cryptographically
secure random numbers are not always easy to obtain and RNG failures
have been the reason for multiple real-world attacks in the past, so
EdDSA is designed to not rely on a secure RNG for signing.
The second hash includes R at the beginning, which is not
attacker-controlled and makes the scheme collision-resilient. The point
is that an attacker who can compute an internal or external collision
of H cannot forge a signature. Obviously, this feature is lost when
replacing M with H(M) (i.e., when pre-hashing the message). The cost of
not pre-hashing depends on the length of the message. For signatures on
short messages (like, e.g., public keys) the overhead is neglible, for
very long messages it approaches a factor of 2.
I certainly agree that it's a good idea to use a stronger hash function
than MD5. When suggesting a better payoff for CPU cycles, then the
questions are what message lengths you're dealing with and what attacks
you're worried about. Personally, until quantum computers are built, I
am less concerned about a DLP attack against Curve25519 than about a
collision in SHA-2.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Qubes 
Hi John, hi all,
I'm using Qubes for about one year now and I'm very happy with it. It's
great how well the separation of different security domains in virtual
machines is integrated into a work flow that does not significantly
impact my productivity.
However, when switching to Qubes, learning about how this integration
works, and slightly adapting how you use a computer, you should expect
some weeks of reduced productivity.
Qubes works quite ok on my Thinkpad X240 with 8GB of RAM, but I
occasionally run into the problem that I cannot start a VM. On my X260
with 16GB of RAM I have never experienced this problem and everything
runs very smoothly. In other words: yes, it is quite demanding, in
particular in terms of RAM.
If you're planning to transition to Qubes, it probably makes sense to
first organize data in your home directory in different subdirectories,
one for each of the VMs you're planning to use and observe how data
flows between those subdirectories. I did not do this, and later wished
I had.
I hope this helps.
Best regards,
