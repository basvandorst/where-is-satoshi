Ummm... Circuit City Divx failed in the marketplace because consumers
had alternatives --- VHS and no-time-limit DVDs.  But the proposed law
makes it *illegal* to sell a PC which doesn't "adhere to ... security
system standards":
    Sec. 101: Prohibition of Certain Devices
      (a) In General -- It is unlawful to manufacture, import, offer to
      the public, provide or otherwise traffic in any interactive digital
      device that does not include and utilize certified security
      technologies that adhere to the security system standards adopted
      under section 104.
They're not leaving this to the marketplace if they can help it.
