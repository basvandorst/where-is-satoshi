I'm' probably
Uhm, ahem, er.... Kerberos, SPNEGO, Shibolleth?
So, I'm probably going to ignite an excrement-storm of flames here, but...
Kerboeros via SPNEGO is already supported in most if not all of the
popular browsers.  Keeps the password close to home.  Scales well for
some variables, and give single-sign-on capabilities
Shibboleth because in most places where one ends up authenticating to
a server, all the server really needs is authorization information.
So, authenticate to your chosen IDP, and get assertions that you can
hand off to any SP that recognizes your IDP.
There are details of course... but it might be easier than developing
an entirely new protocol that nobody yet supports.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Infinite Noise or Firebug? 
Firebug sounds too much like Firefox, everyone will think it's
a Mozilla thing..
Given that it plays loose with acronymization (Fi != Fast, Bu != Bit),
Fartbig would be a closer and more memorable match.

Um, not SMTP? Then what protocol does the MUA use for submission?
For certain values of "misconfigured."  Some sites may need to support
older MUAs that use port 25 by default.  That's sometimes known as
"legacy support."
So what am I missing here? if a device is botted, it doesn't matter
whether the submission port is 25 or 587; The attacker can use the
credentials stored on the device, and send spam via either port.  So why
is it okay for the ISP to break TLS on port 25 and not on port 587?
And if the user has valid credentials to send mail via the remote MSA,
what business is it of the ISP to decide whether or not it's spam?
It's between the user and the MSA.
While the ISPs intentions may have been noble (and I'm not convinced)
there are all kinds of ways that ISPs *could* combat nefarious
activity that are neither appropriate nor legal.
  To paraphrase
Jurassic Park, just because they can do it doesn't mean they
should do it.

@_subject: [Cryptography] SUBMIT is not SMTP, 
For a slightly different example of using "wrong" ports, I have to
run KDCs on ports 80 and 443 in addition to the standard ports, due
to various guest wireless networks (seemingly mostly at universities)
that inexplicably block all other outbound ports.
With regard to using port 25 for submission, I'm pretty sure that it's
entirely possible for an ESMTP server to accept both authenticated and
unauthenticated mail and treat each appropriately.
Regarding the justification of breaking the encrytped, authenticated
session to check for spam, if an ISP considers that activity on port
587 to be acceptable, then it really has no justification do
otherwise for the same on port 25.

Heck, just run the source through lint and blindly fix anything it finds,
like use of uninitialized variables.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Of writing down passwords 
A yellow sticky not is not that secure -- it falls off too easily :-)
I like using blue masking tape, stays on well and doesn't leave
residue.  Slight hard to read, but you don't need to read it that
often anyway.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Of writing down passwords 
Just to flog the sentiment to death:
The dogma against writing down passwords is one of the worst things that
security practitioners have continued to promulgate, and by "worst" I
mean in terms of impact on effectiveness of security (second only to use
of firewalls, but that's not a crypto discussion).  To tell users that
they have to have a password that by definition is hard to remember, but
they're not allowed to write it down, goes against all usability notions,
and invites the crappy password choices that really do cause problems.
The threat model regarding writing down passwords is non-existant or
at least grossly overblown in most contexts; it *was* a big deal in the
military (from whence the recommendation came), where internal espionage
was obviously a big deal.  I think in general if you have to worry about
the guy in the next cubicle stealing your wallet to get your passwords,
you've got much bigger problems.
My goal is to have a policy that has my users getting one really strong
password that they never have to change, and they're allowed to write it
down and keep it in a reasonably safe place.

The nice thing about not giving the device a default route, as opposed
to filtering at the border, is that the "block" works independent of any
other devices.  More than once I've seen a firewal that was supposed
to be blocking all kinds of things, but one incorrect addition to the
ruleset exposed everything, without anyone realizing it at the time.

@_subject: [Cryptography] SSH vulnerability when using passwords 
IIRC, That attack actually depends on on which authentication method
gets used for password authentication.  The "password" method described
in RFC 4252 sends the password all at once (if/how it gets fragmented
by the transport and crypto layer is left as an exercise for the reader).
The challenge-response method defined in RFC 4256 sends keystrokes one
at a time and is vulnerable to timing analysis.  challenge-response can
be used for password authentication, and may get used it and precedes
password authentication as a allowed method, and the server's PAM
configuration is set up for password auth (the default on Linux),
You may be thinking of Dawn Song's 2001 Usenix paper:
At least a partial defense is to disallow the challenge-response method
in sshd_config on the server, and ssh_config on clients.
I believe I read something about adding padding to ssh packets
to randomize the packet sizes, but the specifics escape me at the moment.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Smart electricity meters can be dangerously 
I'll second that.  In my experience in California, meters never get
replaced unless the homewner is upgrading their services.  I've never
known anyone to say that their meter died and they had to get a new one.
The only time I have ever seen the power company unilaterally replace
meters is the switch to smart meters.
Correct. Cost aside, it's a major disruption that customers don't like.
Tho I have to say, Southern California Gas cleverly swapped out my gas
meter (using a smart meter) without disrupting my service.
Unless they start giving out false readings and you start losing revenue.
