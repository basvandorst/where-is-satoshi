@_subject: Using a MAC in addition to symmetric encryption 
Hello all,
If I exchange messages with a system and the messages are encrypted with a symmetric key, what further benefit would we get by using a MAC (Message Authentication Code) along with the message encryption?
Being new to all this, using the encrytpion and MAC together seem redundant.
