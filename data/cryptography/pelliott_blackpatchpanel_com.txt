@_subject: [Cryptography] deniable symmetric ciphers? 
Call a symmetric ciphers deniable if it is computationaly
difficult to distinguish it's output from random data
even if it's plaintext is highly ordered or even known.
Are there any strong published deniable ciphers?
Thank You.

@_subject: [Cryptography] How to use FST-01? 
Over the Holidays I recieved a Flying Stone Technology 01.
It is apparently a very small computer connected to
a usb port.
It apparently has 2 applications and both have relevance
to crypto.
1 Gnuk, Cryptographic USB Token
2 NeuG, a True Random Number Generator Implementation
All of the published software is GPLed.
I have a number of questions:
How do I set up the FST-01 to be a hardware RNG?
How do I use?
Will it work with my Raspberry PI?
If my Raspberry PI has a 1 amp power supply, can I plug the
FST-directly into it or do I need to use a powered usb hub?
Rapberry PI are notoriously finicky about their power, a small
voltage drop causes the PI to fail. There are many usb devices
that can not be directly plugged into a PI. Is the FST-01 one
of these?
What is the reason for GnuK? What is the use case?
What is a Cryptographic USB Token?
Can I setup my FST-01 to be either a GNUK or a NEUG depending
on the desire of the moment?
Thank You for considering these questions.

I already use The PI to serve random numbers to my LAN. I have several
computers with no onboard hardware RNG.
It uses socat with privately distributed keys, (no certificates) to encrypt
that data as it flows.
I have not turned this into a package, because I do not know how to help
the admin deal with the key distribution problem and I do not know how to
convert the sysvinit files to  systemd.

No, it dumps the entropy into /dev/random using rng-tools rngd.

You can put one of the usb based HRNG into the pi and share it with
your whole net.

You have to modprobe bcm2708_rng and add "bcm2708_rng" to modules.
Then install rng-tools.
Then the rng on the pi will run fast.
In fact I use it as a source for random numbers for all the
computers on my lan that don't have a hardware rng.
