@_subject: [Cryptography] "WannaCry" ransomware has any payment resulted 
Hi Tom,
In answer to your question: "I wonder if any payment resulted in a valid key?",
this article was published in CSO Online yesterday, the title says it all:
"Paying the WannaCry ransom will probably get you nothing. Here's why."

I have been watching the news on the "WannaCry" ransomware and I wonder if any payment resulted in a valid key?
It seems that the bitcoin payment step is secure but the delivery of the key via return message is the fragile transaction from the criminals view of things.
A short list of rich payments might be worth the risk to keep the scam alive but the list must be short.
The interesting tech here if and only if this was a "responsible scam"
would be  key management.
Identifying the correct key for the correct 'locked' machine has a couple issues.  One is the machine is locked so any reliable ID of the specific machine seems difficult to parse and since the machine is locked a different machine must be used to make payment, communicate the machine ID, receive the key and apply it to the locked machine.
Yes "responsible scam"  sounds oxymoronic at best a cruel kindness.
Well time to go update my machines, scan for viruses and make backups!
Also make myself a 'different' account with admin privileges and  may myself a goober account for interacting with the world.  Boot and recovery media too.
What a pain...

Hi John,
Since you cite Estonia specifically in your last sentence: please note yesterday's article in Forbes: "Estonia's ID Card And The March Of Cryptography"

In article <13702759.1bt7j2b2zW at lovemachine> you write:
Because it was never supposed to be a national ID.  SSNs were invented in the 1930s when Social Security was invented, as an account number to track people's contributions and benefits.  Back in the 1930s, account numbers were not common.  The minority of people who paid income tax put their names at the top of their form 1040.  Your bank account had your name, not a number.  (Account numbers arrived in the 1950s when the Bank of America started automated check sorting.)  Unfortunately for us, the people who designed the account system for the Social Security Administration did a really good job, and even though it's 80 years later, the numbering system is still adequate for its original purpose, and as we have seen sort of adequate for way too many other purposes with which it has been overloaded.
It seems to me that the worse abuse of the SSN is the fiction that it is secret, and so anyone who presents your SSN must be you.  I'd pass a law that says that any account or transaction or database authenticated only or primarily with an SSN is presumed fraudulent and uncollectable.  This specifically includes credit bureaus.
As far as a better national ID, there are lots of countries with national IDs, some of which work better than others.  You might start by looking at Estonia which is small and sophisticated, and India which is huge.

This article from the NY Times dated March 2013 suggests otherwise, and says that 20 of the top 25 banks REQUIRED SSN to open a bank account.
The article starts with a prescient statement: "Despite the risk of fraud associated with the theft of Social Security numbers..."

of usable storage, and any two of those 12 drives can fail without causing
us any data loss whatsoever.
RAID5 and especially RAID6 have TERRIBLE write performance, which you can
quantify here:  Disks are already the slowest part of a system, so why make their
performance even less?
I always use RAID10, which provides fast rebuilds if a drive fails, elevator
seeks (elevator algorithm) and load balancing between the pairs of drives.
And anyway, today you can get (at Amazon) much large drives such as WD
Purple Surveillance 8TB for US$208, or 12TB for $330 (compare that to your
12 drives @ 1TB below).

@_subject: [Cryptography] The Samsung global Blu-Ray meltdown 
Blu-ray players globally have been stuck in a reboot loop with a period of
about five seconds, or had firmware updates.  presumably for a reflash, with no-one yet able to figure out what's causing
it.  I was surprised to read this, since I watched a movie last night on my
Samsung Blu-ray player.
I suspect "all but" is not very accurate, but *some* or *many* would be a
more accurate statement?
And looks like the lawyers are already lining up about this failure (which
lists three specific model numbers: BD-JM57C, BD-J5900, and HT-J5500W): I wonder if this will hasten Samsung quit making new Blu-ray players

found (to my surprise) that kevlar vests were regulated.
I don't believe that statement is generally true, as it appears to be a
RIGHT, at least in the USA,
see for example  which if
you scroll down states this:
     Who can buy a bulletproof vest?      As a resident of the US, you have the right to buy and own a
bulletproof vest.      The only people who cannot own a bulletproof vest are those people who
have been convicted of a violent felony.      If you have been convicted of a violent felony you have forfeited the
right to own body armor.
That web page further says they can ship directly to 49 states, and the only
exception is Connecticut, which requires face-to-face transaction thru a
local dealer.
