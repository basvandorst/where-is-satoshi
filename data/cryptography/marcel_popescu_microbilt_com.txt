You might also want to look into installing a tracker and sharing them with
BitTorrent  - it should help with the
bandwidth requirements for anyone making them available.

@_subject: "Approximate" hashes 
I am trying to build a Windows anti-spam thingy; it's supposed to "sit" in
between the mail client and the outer world, and indicate through mail
headers whether the incoming mail has a valid hashcash
 "coin" (and, of course, to automatically add
hashcash to outgoing emails).
My problem is that I don't know what happens with the email in transit
(this, I believe, is an observation in the hashcash FAQ). I am worried that
some mail server might dislike ASCII characters with the high bit set, or
that a client uses some encoding which for some reason doesn't make it to
the destination unchanged.
Hence my question: is there some "approximate" hash function (which I could
use instead of SHA-1) which can verify that a text hashes "very close" to a
value? So that if I change, say, tabs into spaces, I won't get exactly the
same value, but I would get a "good enough"?
I don't know if this is possible. But if it is, I though this would be a
good place to find out about it.

I just had an idea. Would this work?
- let S be the input string, whose hash I want to verify
- make S uppercase
- remove everything but A-Z, 0-9, and common punctuation (!;:'",.?)
- calculate the SHA1 hash of the result
This should keep any insignificant changes out of the final result. Does
anyone know of a mail transformation which could upset it? Can anyone see a
way to "attack" this by letting a significantly different message collide on
the same hash? (I'm ignoring the recent discoveries - they're not that
practical, I'm only trying to fight spam, not the government.)

Me dumb, sorry. I was actually thinking of some other thing I wanted to do
about spam (which involved the whole content), and haven't re-read the
hashcash site in about a week.
You are perfectly right, of course. Windows spam victims, here I come!

My apologies. I've been using Amir's tool since he posted the link, but I
haven't thought of sending a "thank you" note :(
Amir, I also think it's neat. :)

Why not the way it happens right now - re-encoding? Few people post DVD
images of movies on p2p networks, and even when they do, I prefer a DivX or
XviD variant. (Much better given my 'net bandwidth.) I strongly doubt
there's any chance of a watermark surviving an unknown re-encoding process
(DivX has dozens of parameters you can change).

Do you have some articles about these protocols? I can't find anything on
your webpage, and a newbie (like myself) can't distinguish between well
designed and badly designed protocols. Can you recommend such a collection
of well designed protocols for various purposes? With implementation caveats
if possible?
(I haven't looked at it in a long time - is Handbook of Applied Cryptography
a good reference for this?)

The authoritative reference for TLS is the TLS RFC ( The authoritative reference for IPsec
is of course the IPsec RFC ( As to why they wouldn't use these as they stand, synchronized protocols often require finer control over the data block size than these offer, but modification is
easy enough, and would certainly have caused fewer concerns than a roll your
[Marcel] Thanks, and appreciated, but I haven't made myself clear. I meant:
is there a page by one of the known names in the field saying something
like: "if you want to do this, then you should use these protocols"? Like
Peter said: they should have used TLS or YASSL for the handshake and IPSEC +
ESP for the transport. Is there a place where one trying to implement a
secure system could go and find out the basic components he needs? With pros
and cons, preferably?
[Marcel] Maybe this is too much to ask, I don't know. That's pretty much the
point :)
