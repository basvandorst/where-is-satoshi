@_subject: CrypTool 
yesterday I attended a presentation about a software teaching people
crypto.  It's free, so I tested it a bit, and it's seemingly nice
and fit to help students understand what good crypto is and what's
not.  It was invented by a guy working at Deutsche Bank who was
horrified about the companies programmers coding new security schemes
into the banks software packages on the fly without knowing a bit
about crypto and underlying mathematics.  The software since then
has been shifted to a group at University of Darmstadt which is
developing it right now.
The software is available for W32 only (*sigh*) but in English as
well as German:
  At the presentation they said that next steps in development will be
new demonstrators ("how does TLS work") on the content side and on the
organisational side the port to Unix.  With that they hope they can
get it Open Sourced.
The software is intended for educational purposes, so right now they
limited the key space for most algorithms to 20 bit.  Well, until
the source is released I guess....    ;-)

The economic reasoning within the paper misses casualties that arise
from automated, large scale attacks.
In figure 2, the graph indicating the "Black Hat Discovery Process"
suggests we should expect a minor impact of "Private Exploitation" only,
because the offending Black Hat group is small and exploits manually. However, one could also imagine Code Red, Slammer and the like.  Apart
from having a fix ready or not, when vulnerabilities of this kind are
not known *at all* to the public (no problem description, no workaround
like "remove file XYZ for a while" known), worms can hit the network far
more severe than they already do with knowledge of vulnerability and
even fixes available.  I would expect the "Intrusion Rate" curve to be
formed radically different at this point.  This also affects the
discussion about social welfare lost / gained through discloure quite a
I don't see how applying Browne's vulnerability cycle concept to the
Black Hat Discovery case as it has been done in the paper can reflect
these threat scenarios correctly.

So if we don't peg the C_BHD/C_WHD ratio to something happening in the
real world, it's "all depends on your threat model" again.  If I assume
a specific ratio that 'justifies' finding bugs in terms of economic
trade-off, you may disagree by believing in a different ratio.  It could
be of interest which threat model represents which ratio to see the
effects in economic trade-off - however, the discussion is simply
shifted towards "which threat model is more realistic".  What do we
