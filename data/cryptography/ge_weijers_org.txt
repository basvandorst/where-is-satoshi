Keeping a secret for 30 years is a very different proposition from keeping
a SCADA system secure for 30 years. Long-term (or even short-term) secrecy
is not a major concern for most embedded applications of this type.
I would suggest making the remote management component (or at least the
network interface) one that can be upgraded independently from the rest of
the system. This may be too costly for consumer devices, but may be cheaper
in the long run for commercial equipment. As you mentioned we don't know
how to design systems that stay secure for 30 years anyway. Perhaps we
should give these controllers an expiration date, after which they're
required to go offline until they get maintenance.

The question is whether that particular ARM processor can keep a secret if
it gets into the wrong hands. People with logic analyzers and chip probes.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Vice: Amazon removes full disk encryption from 
The low cost hardware used by Amazon may not have a TPM or Secure Element
embedded, so secure encryption would require really high-entropy passwords.
And rather than pretending that there's security they removed the
encryption altogether.
If this is the case (and that's a big if) the reason for the removal may
not be collusion with the government. Bad crypto can get you in trouble
these days.

To quote SP-800-38D:
In other words, unless an implementation only uses 96-bit IVs that are
generated by the deterministic construction:
The total number of invocations of the authenticated encryption function
shall not exceed 2^32, including all IV lengths and all instances of the
authenticated encryption function with the given key.
 Or: if you use a counter for the nonce after doing a Diffie-Hellman
exchange to generate fresh keys you can go safely beyond 2^32. The
requirement is that repeating a nonce should have a probability < 2^-32,
and using a counter you can trivially meet that requirement.

Desoldering the RAM while maintaining a low temperature should be interesting.
The original raspberry pi used a PoP package, which would make it even
more interesting.

History repeats itself.
This happened 6 years ago, but it took regulatory changes to get the gaming
industry to update their random number generators. Updating the RNG
triggers an expensive review by the labs that do the analysis and testing
of the games, so the industry was resistant to changing things.
I'm sure there are still plenty of clueless applications of insecure random
number generators around.
