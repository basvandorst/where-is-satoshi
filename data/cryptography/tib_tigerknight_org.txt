@_subject: NSA tapping undersea fibers? 
I'm curious as well about how the tap could actually happen though without
some major bells and whistles taking place. If my understanding of fiber is
correct, data flows at incredible rates through a line - but one fracture and
suddenly you're going to have massive data loss and I can imagine that at the
controlling house for that fiber line all manner of noise is going to happen,
which would also (another guess) cause events to roll into place where a repair
team would be sent out ASAP to check on the fiber and fix it - in which case
the people trying to install the tap would be caught red handed? I don't have
the manual handy on how they manage trans oceanic fiber lines, and I know there
are a few for redundancy so that they might not fly/swim out there immediately
for repairs. It would also be incredibly fishy to any operator who saw a line
go down and then come backup when both sides report that all physically
immediately inspectable connections are otherwise normal and good? Hate to be
cliche in this thought but if this happened about the only way I can see this
taking place (from the limited knowledge I have on this) would be if there was
an NSA or other government agent standing over the operator as the alarm went
off about the line failure and canceling it, then politely telling the operator
'This never happened, and I was never here' (a'la James Earl Jones in Hunt for
Red October).
To sum this whole thing up - /IS/ there a way to put a tap on a fiber line
without letting the whole world know you're doing it, if not just the
operator/owner of the line itself? And if so could someone sketch it out for
me or point me to a resource? I'd love to learn of it
