Call for Chapters: *Security Solutions and Applied Cryptography in Smart
Grid Communications*
URL1 : URL2 :
Electrical energy storage is a key factor for the future. The consumption
of electrical energy (i.e. the use of air conditioning, audio and video
devices or electric heating) is increasing every year due; firstly to the
increase of the population and secondly by the appearance of new uses of
consumption, such as electric cars. With this increase consumption, how to
ensure the balance between supply and demand for electricity at all times?
To address this problem, the idea of placing the new generation of smart
grids to control this energy has appeared in recent literature in different
flavors in order to provide electric power supply secure, sustainable and
competitive to consumers. In addition, the revolution in smart grid
involves a significant change in side of the consumer where consumers will
also become producer with the ability of energy storage such as in the
vehicle battery, or as a local generation sources such as photovoltaic
panels. However, the smart grid develops modern solutions for the
next-generation network and digital communication in which many systems and
subsystems are interconnected to provide services from end-to-end network
between various actors and between intelligent devices that are deployed
there. Within each network, a hierarchical structure is composed of
different types of networks, such as the HANs (Home Area Networks), the
BANs (Building Area Networks), the IANs (Industrial Area Networks), the
NANs (Neighborhood Area Networks), the FANs (Field Area Networks), and the
WANs (Wide Area Networks). Currently, large societies propose the use of
cloud computing in smart grid applications connected with the electrical
control center. The main problem in the development of a smart grid is not
located at the physical medium but mainly in delivery of reliability and
security. The possibility of fitting with active or passive attacks in
smart grid network is great to divulge privacy and disrupt energy (e.g.
Wormhole Attack, False Data Injection Attack, Black Hole Attack, Grey Hole
Attack, DoS Attack, Physical Layer Attack, Colluding Adversary Attack,
Routing Table Overflow Attack etc.). Therefore, the security requirements,
including authentication, accountability, integrity, non-repudiation,
access control and confidentiality should be paid more attention in the
future for high performance smart grids. This book will cover the current
scope of various methodologies and mechanisms in the theory and practice of
security, privacy, intrusion detection, and applied cryptography in smart
grid communications in one place.
This comprehensive and timely publication aims to be an essential reference
source, building on the available literature in the field of smart grid
security in developing countries while providing for further research
opportunities in this dynamic field. It is hoped that this text will
provide the resources necessary for policy makers, technology developers
and managers to adopt and implement smart grid platforms in developing
nations across the globe.
