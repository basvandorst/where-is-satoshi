First, let me thank this list for the wonderful breadth and depth of knowledge that I've seen over the years; it's a great resource.
Funny you should mention that.  Back in the late 70s, a work colleague suggested that the Unix crypt() function was a ring (we both had mathematical backgrounds), which gave me the idea of repeatedly encrypting the encrypted root password.
The fastest machine available to me was a PDP-11/70, but I got sprung by the sysadmin for chewing up CPU time...

@_subject: [Cryptography] Use process ID in mixing? 
On other systems such as *BSD (and I include the Mac in that), there is the getpid() call (get process ID) and getppid() (get parent's process ID).  I have no idea why Linux abandoned them.
Just goes to show, if you're cutting important code (such as using the PID
for various reasons) then you'd better be familiar with that platform,
and try to program for other platforms as well.  A common trick to seed
a low-quality PRNG (for non-critical use) is to add the PID to the time;
that way, each process seeding at the same time gets a different one.
I *did* say it was low-quality, for casual use...

After battling through Schneier (a prerequisite before posting to this list), I am now reading "Handbook of Applied Cryptography", by Menezes, Oorschot, and Vanstone.
Blimey, but these blokes don't muck around.  In the first chapter alone, he gets into mathematics that I haven't used since my University days.
There is a list of corrections available, and upon (ahem) applying them, I found a couple of errors in the errata; Menezes was gracious enough to investigate, and to report back.
The book itself, well; the ISBN is a small bar-code on the bottom right-hand corner of the back cover (there is no ISBN page as such, and Menezes expressed surprise at that), and the only way you'll find the date of publication is a small glyph just above it.

It's somewhat common to throw a set of dice to generate a "good enough" random number, or at least a seed.  However, they appear to have a slight bias in favour of "6", due to the pattern of the dimples.
I reported this in the "quirky" column in a respected Australian newspaper (search smh.com.au for "Column 8" and "dice" for 6th August; I couldn't get the URL for the page itself other than an ugly search expression) and today it got followed up.
It seems that someone actually did the experiment back in 1966, with about 10,000 rolls, and found a "statistically significant" bias in favour of "6" being uppermost.

Nothing stronger than 40 bits was permitted to be exported, because it was classed as a munition (I'll leave the politics etc out of it, as there's too much confusion with both PGP and alleged RC4 being leaked, and strong crypto development by non-US nations).

Blimey, but that was a tome and a half...  Over a thousand pages of fairly dense writing (with little mathematics involved).  I can't even begin to do it justice, so I'll just point out a few highlights.
Originally published in 1967, this edition is 1996, and covers material such as Enigma, Purple, the capture of the Pueblo, public-key crypto, etc, all of which were unknown at the time.
His breadth and depth of knowledge is immense, and he has a knack of recalling events as though he was actually present.  If there's anything that he didn't mention then it probably wasn't worth it; well, except possibly for ROT-13 (unknown in 1967).  His prose tends to be a bit flowery at times, but he's anything but dry.
Examples of topics include the Egyptian hierpglyphics (there are several versions), the Rosetta Stone, Linear B, the Voynich Manuscript, whether Bacon wrote Shakespeare's stuff, etc.
No Such Agency doesn't escape scrutiny (there's even a photograph of the building!), but not in as much depth as Bamford's "The Puzzle Palace"; I haven't reviewed the latter because it's more NSA than crypto.
I have no idea how he had so much access to so much material.

Hmmm...  Bruce mentions the Polish, so I'm not sure how I misremembered my version.  Trouble is, there are *many* books on Enigma...  The version I heard was indeed that a cipher clerk (presumably under stress - my guess only) forgot to change the rotor settings; pick your new schedule and send it under the old settings, then flip them for that message (think of it as a primitive CBC, in a way).  He forgot to flip the rotors to the new settings; as I said, this is what I recall reading somewhere (Google?).
As for the OP, I hadn't heard that it was Japanese-held Midway that got bombed, merely that it was Japanese.  Dunno where I read both the above.
Hmmm...  Could've been Simon Singh where I saw Enigma (he has a couple of chapters on it, and I misremembered as usual).  He doesn't mention FISH, though (but Bruce does).  Singh mentions Midway, but the Allies had already cracked it, and decoded a message telling the Japanese to retake Midway, so by then it was already broken.  I dunno...
We'll never know the whole story, of course.

Although somewhat small compared with Schneier etc (nearly 400 A5 pages), it's packed with information.  Published around the turn of the century, it's probably a little dated now, given the speed with which crypto (not to mention the NSA) is advancing.
Not too technical, it's an enjoyable read; there is a chapter on how Egyptian heiroglpyhs were decoded, a chapter on the Vigenere cipher, another on Playfair, another on Enigma, Rosetta, Purple, quantum, you get the picture.
One minor annoyance is the mis-spelling of "prise" (he uses "prize"), but spelling mistakes tend to leap out at me,
There's even an exercise or two.
I would certainly recommend it as a good introduction to crypto.  If you want something more technical then read Schneier or Menenzes, but if you want to interest you son/daughter in crypto then use this.

I'd still suggest covering crypto in general, if only to get people aware of the need for it; the security of entire nations depends upon it (such as the famous Hot Line betwixt the White House and the Kremlin).
Unless you're talking to a crypto audience (in which case you'd better have done your homework, otherwise they will rip you apart), just keep it Quantum crypto is still worth a brief mention (just to get them interested), but it's still lab-only, and probably will not be deployed in my life-time (I'm hitting 62).

The OP could also mention how various crypto schemes have been broken (Enigma because an operator screwed up by re-using a key - always a no-no), such as the Japanese "Purple", wherein a water supply on a Japanese-held island was arranged to be bombed, and fair enough, the next message mentioned it, thereby confirming that the Allies had broken it (chosen plain-text, in a way).
Then there was the case where the operator, probably with bombs falling around his ears, accidentally sent the plaintext as well as the ciphertext - manna from heaven!  The Allies weren't interested in the message, but they derived the key for that day.  It was likely that a message said
something like "the next key is blah-blah"...
And although not technically crypto (but still related to secrecy), you could get bonus points for mentioning Mata Hari, probably the original And again not technically crypto but still secrecy-related, the ancient Greeks used to grab the nearest slave (plenty of them about), shave his head, and tattoo the meesage onto his scalp.  After the hair had grown back, he was sent on his way with an innocuous message.  Perfect security, if latency wasn't a problem...
Ah, the Cube...  There's a book on how to solve it, but I "solved" it merely by ripping it apart and re-assembling it.  I suppose it's a form of decryption, albeit by brute force :-)

Another fine piece of computer history :-)  Keep it up, Jerry, otherwise the youngsters will be condemned to repeat mistakes from the past.  You're making an old programmer very happy...
Computers are very good at breaking crypto; just ask Alan Turing.  His "bombe" was reading German High Command messages like newspapers.  Whenever the key was changed there was a mad scramble to figure out the new one.
IIRC, the German Navy used the Enigma with an extra rotor, but it eventually was cracked.  Not only was a U-boat refueller sunk in the Indian Ocean, but so were the next seven subs that turned up.  German High Command suspected that Enigma was broken (that was somewhat blatant, after all), but Hitler refused to believe it.
All it takes is one screw-up such as re-using a key (to be fair, the operator probably had bombs dropping around his ears) and you now have the keys to the kingdom, as it were.  Or the more "direct action" method of bombing a water supply to help break the Japanese Purple...
I hope someone's archiving this list.
For the newcomers on this list, read anything by Schneier, Menenzes et al, Kahn, and Bamford.  There are probably others; from where I sit, I can see four crypto books.  No, make that five (I just saw my Singh)...

Funny you should say that; it seems Australia Post has come clean:
(You may need to be a subscriber)
Australia Post data shows more mail being accessed by government agencies
Australia Post disclosed confidential information to law enforcement, security and other government agencies more than 10,000 times in 2013-14, an increase of 25 per cent over the past four years.
According to statistics released by the postal corporation, "specially protected" information, which includes information about letters and parcels and other private client information was provided to government agencies by Australia Post on 5635 occasions ? more than twice the number four years ago.
Federal government investigators accessing specially protected information include the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Taxation Office, Centrelink, Medicare and the Child Support Agency.
Victorian and Queensland police as well as the NSW Crime Commission and the Western Australian Corruption and Crime Commission also received such private information.
Postal information that is not "specially protected", including names and addresses on the outside of letters and parcels, was disclosed by Australia Post on another 4367 occasions.
Government agencies accessing this postal "metadata" include the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, and the federal departments of agriculture, environment, defence, foreign affairs and trade, health and State police and anti-corruption agencies, state revenue offices, consumer affairs, workplace and environmental regulators as well as the RSPCA also accessed the information.
An Australia Post spokesperson said the corporation only discloses information to authorised agencies "under a law of the Commonwealth, or for the enforcement of criminal law, or for enforcement of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or the protection of the public revenue".
The spokesperson emphasised information is disclosed "only after the 'authorised agency' requesting the information from us establishes that the information is reasonably required for ? lawful purposes".
The total of 10,002 disclosures in 2013-14 was 5 per cent higher than in the previous year, despite a 4.8 per cent decline in the volume of letters delivered by Australia Post.
Only 19 disclosures of postal information were made to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.  This figure for 2013-14 is down from 31 disclosures in the previous year and is the lowest in a decade.
Australia Post's statistics show ASIO's access to postal information peaked in 2005-06 and 2006-07, with 117 and 226 disclosures respectively, a period that covered major counter-terrorism investigations in Victoria and New South Wales.
ASIO must obtain a warrant from the Attorney-General to seek any postal information from Australia Post.  Although the 2013-14 disclosure statistics precede the recent surge in counter-terrorism operations focused on supporters of the so-called Islamic State, the figures do suggest that ASIO's investigations target quite small numbers of people.
However, the Australia Post statistics also show that despite consistent declines in mail volume, confidential postal information is increasingly accessed by police, by government agencies enforcing laws that impose financial penalties and for "the protection of the public revenue".

Ah, a sort of automatic return to LTRS, as it were.  You'd need a latching relay to keep the LTRS/FIGS state, and some assorted comparators to release it.  This means a power supply, but you already have one to drive the lamps (having never seen an Enigma, I'm assuming that the rest of it is purely mechanical), but it may need to be beefed up a bit.  Increased weight, but the thing was never designed to be portable, any more than a Teletype was (sorry, but my Amateur radio background keeps sneaking in).
The transistor had yet to be invented, and I'd go for relay logic instead of valves ("toobs" for you Americans), for simplicity and reliability (vibration can do nasty things to a filament).  Which reminds me: I assume the Enigma had a lamp-test button?  Be a bit embarrassing if it didn't light up...

It wasn't an optical mechanism, but I could not tell, at a glance, that the thing was write-enabled or otherwise.
A story went around the traps at that time that there was a shop where the only write-ring was in the manager's desk; there was me, later on, with a desk-drawer full of Ethernet cables (both straight and crossed), BNC taps, etc; you name it, and we had it.
Sticky-tape over the 5-1/4" cutout on a floppy also worked wonders at times, but not that I would ever admit to it, of course...

reasons: not only is it expected to be a tight contest, with two conservative governments in two other states falling after just one term in several months, but it also sees the introduction of e-voting.
It's not available to all, but merely to those who cannot attend a polling place on the day, due to sickness, absence, disability, etc.  As an aside, despite what you may hear otherwise, Australia does *not* have compulsory voting, but compulsory *attendance* (and I think I've broken the law merely by reporting that).
Being somewhat disabled myself (the nearest polling place is further away than I care to walk), I registered online, proved my identity (name, DOB, address, driver's licence number etc), made up a 6-digit PIN, and received an authorisation token via SMS for subsequent use.
There is a demonstration page, and whoever designed it has a wicked sense of humour.
In the lower house, for the seat of Sydney Harbour (known for its large floating population) we have the "Khaki Party" (a take on The Greens), the "Workers Party" (ditto Labor Party), etc; in the upper house we have e.g. "Australians for Advancement" (our anthem is "Advance Australia Fair"), "City Life Party (Spencer Davis Group)" (and please don't tell me that I need to explain that), etc.
The e-voting polls open a few days earlier; a receipt code will be issued, which can be used to verify that your vote has been recorded as cast, and after the close of polls that it was included in the count.
I'll report on my subsequent experiences.
Who said that bureaucrats don't have a sense of humour?

We prove that the set of DES permutations (encryption and decryption for each DES key) is not closed under functional composition.  This implies that, in general, multiple DES-encryption is not equivalent to single DES-encryption, and that DES is not susceptible to a particular known-plaintext attack which requires, on average, 2^28 steps.  We also show that the size of the subgroup generated by the set of DES permutations is greater than 10^2499, which is too large for potential attacks on DES which would exploit a small subgroup.

How would an owner design a brand that could not be altered, and how could a rustler get around it?  For example, the owner would not use a single letter (a circle for example could be branded around it), and would not use letters that could be altered (such as F -> E, L -> E, O -> Q, T -> I, etc), whereas a rustler would have to find a compliant blacksmith.

Presumably banks don't want you to shop around...  In Australia, for example, it's pretty cut-throat, with just four major banks owning most of the market, and a lot of small ones (including credit unions etc) picking up the crumbs.
The "Big Four" (as they're known) are fighting off a proposed Royal Commission into their rapacious activities following some major scandals, so I don't expect them to be exactly forthcoming about what they do.

In Australia at least, encryption via Amateur radio is legal for remote control of repeaters, beacons, etc; I don't know about the rest of the world.  However, I have, cough cough, passed the occasional message using PGP...  Highly illegal, of course.
I had to switch off the local repeater VK2RWI when foul-mouthed idiots were abusing it; knowing that I was being recorded by said idiots, I had to change the lead-in code every so often (under Australian law, as the repeater keeper I was held responsible for all traffic, and it was my duty to switch it off).  As I dimly recall, it was a 3-byte prefix (a massive 24 bits of security!), and I was going to use a rolling CRC-32 code, but I never got around to it (it was a bit much for the Z-80 at both ends).

The German battle cruiser SMS Scharnhorst was sent to the bottom in 1943 by the battleship HMS "Duke of York" in the Battle of North Cape, with the loss of 2,000 crew; the breaking of Enigma had a bit of a role in this, as the Royal Navy knew where she was...
Charles Babbage KH FRS was born in 1791; pretty much the father of the computer, a model of his "difference engine" built to the standards of the day worked, complete with its printer.  What is not so well known about him was that he dabbled in cryptography, and broke the Vigenère cipher; unfortunately for him it was classified as a military secret, so one Friedrich Kasiski got the credit instead.

The subtitle pretty much says it all: "Inside the shadow world of signals intelligence in Australia's two Bletchley Parks"; well, I didn't know that we had two major cryptanalysis facilities here in Oz during WW-2 (Brisbane and Melbourne), so this book was an eye-opener.
That said, it's a refreshing change to see a book written in British English (and grammar), as opposed to American English.  Not to impugn our American cousins, but spelling such as "color" instead of "colour", "meter" instead of "metre", "organization" instead of "organisation" etc really irritate me; and as for "off of" instead of simply "off" (do they actually teach that in schools?), well...  It also uses accents where required e.g. "attaché" etc; yes, I'm a pedantic bastard.  Also, units such as Celsius (and metric in general) are employed, so Imperial-users may need to bone up on them (yes, 40˚ in the shade is damned hot).
Hard-core crypto nerds will be disappointed at the lack of technical details for JN-25 etc (it's mostly a history book), but the fact is that the whole operation was kept secret for decades after the war, but it does mention additive sheets etc.
The book itself appears to be printed on recycled paper, or at least unbleached paper drawn from responsible sources (FSC).
For those who have read Neal Stephenson's "Cryptonomicon" you'll feel right at home, as there are many parallels, but no, Bobby Shaftoe does not get a mention :-)
The book goes into great detail about interservice rivalry, political interference, general incompetence amongst the officers, credit taken for others' work, and good descriptions of Pearl Harbor, Darwin, Midway, Coral Sea, and the assassination of Yamamoto-san (and the cover-up so the Japs wouldn't suspect that Purple had been broken), along with how warnings were simply ignored (Pearl Harbor, Darwin, etc)
The transmitter ID system TINA gets a mention, but little technical detail, sadly enough.
There are excellent photographs, and an extensive bibliography and chapter I only found one typographical error (for some reason, both typos and spelling mistakes leap out at me and grab me by the nuts): on page 80 there is "to slow" instead of "too slow"; minor, but still annoying.
Would I recommend it?  Certainly, if you're a history buff like me (and it's taken up residence along with my other crypto books), but not so much if you wanted hard-core crypto.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Throwing dice for "random" numbers 
I know that I should know the answer to this, but for some reason my brain appears to be in neutral (call it early senility, as I turn 66 soon).
I picked up a a pack of 12 dice from one of those discount stores for the princely sum of AU$2 (so we can safely assume that they are not exactly casino-quality[*], but at least the pattern of dots is correct).
So, the obvious question is: how unpredictable (not "random") would their sum be, modulo N, given that each individual source is numbered 1-6?  I know that I can just throw a decahedronal die for example, but the shipping cost to here down-under seems to outweigh their value, and there does not appear to be a gaming shop within coo-ee of where I live.
It's not for any particular application, but merely an exercise, and as I said the mathematical part of my brain seems to have gone on strike...
I vaguely recall an experiment mentioned in a thread (likely started by me) that showed that a "toy" die tended to land 6-up slightly more than expected because of the small shift in the centre of gravity, due to the 6-side dimples removing more mass.

Today is National Navajo Code Talkers Day; it was used for crypto comms in WW-2, as only a few tribes could speak it.  There were no words for modern objects, so "shark" was used for "destroyer" etc, thereby obfuscating it further, and clipped phrases meant that fluent but untrained speakers would not understand it.
We'll leave aside for the moment the question of how the Navajo tribes, being basically inland, could know about sharks...  My summaries are only as good as my sources.

I've picked up an astonishing amount of information in the meantime (that being the purpose of this list), but basically I was cruising a discount shop, saw these things, and immediately thought of crypto applications, whether "secure" or not (for certain definitions of "secure"), and it occurred to me that it's not as simple as it seems, with the generated output (e.g. modulo 10) not being as uniform as one would hope.

Perhaps the gauge of my tinfoil hat isn't as heavy as it ought to be, but most of the time I'm not as concerned about privacy as some; my email address is clearly visible in the headers as is my IP address, and my residential address can be found from a simple "whois" (I live in a reasonably safe country (we don't walk around armed to the teeth), with a fairly trustworthy government (ditto)).
That said, I do employ privacy measures when required; I am not in the phone directory hence my Caller ID is suppressed (but I can enable it when I want the callee to know that it's me), I rarely use the mobile phone for voice calls (I know that I can be tracked with it, but that's the least of my worries), I never supply my name and address on the Census (yeah, it's illegal), and if I want email anonymity I would use a freemail account (which I also know can be traced if anyone cared enough).
In short: yes, I'm concerned about privacy, but no, I'm yet to visit an aluminium milliner.

[*] Ah yes, the console...  Two big round screens (so a common game run in one of the PPUs was "EYE"), and a keyboard with the "0" key on the left :-(  The usual display configuration was one screen showing the RJE queues and the other showing a sort of dynamic "ps".

Why two facilities?  Army and Navy - typical military NIH behaviour, and as a result they weren't as effective as a joint facility could have been.

Truly a good read!  For example, it was an intercept station in the Queensland bush that brought about Yamamoto's demise.  They knew exactly where and when he would be (he was a stickler for that), and a squadron of P-29s -- practically at the end of their range -- just happened to be in the vicinity...

One of my clients in a previous life was HMAS Watson, which is a training facility for the Royal Australian Navy (so I can't say too much); I was responsible for maintaining their Unix boxes.
Anyway, the servers were supposed to be located in a shielded room (I don't know whether it was supposed to be TEMPEST-rated) and one of the officer's pagers went off.  He was flabbergasted, and posited that if that stuff could get in, then what was getting out?

Blimey, you don't do anything by halves, do you?
Seriously, I know someone in the data recovery business; he can handle just about anything short of physical destruction.  He does a roaring trade; at one time $BOSS had need of such a service (I think a backup tape was accidentally overwritten or something) and so I recommended him to the satisfaction of all parties[*].  And no, I did not get a spotter's fee...
Mind you, it pretty much comes down to "how much is your data worth to Not mine!  There is a fire station just around the corner from me, but I'd rather not put it to the test.
In a nutshell, the magnetic domains are not aligned all at once when overwritten; with highly sensitive read amplifiers and appropriate signal processing you can dig down layer by layer as it were and recover from multiple overwrites.

Interesting; here in Oz we have to turn up in person and undergo an eyesight test, but we get to keep the old licence.  There is no "not valid before" date, but you get to laugh at your old photos.  Validation period is one year or five years (you get a discount), with annual driving tests after 80 or so (depending upon which State).
A possible security risk (from a health point of view) is that your way allows drivers with poor eyesight on the road?
Oh, and licences (in NSW at least) are full of security features such as holograms etc; we stopped using paper licences years ago.

``Swiss investigate report that firm helped CIA crack top-secret messages
Zurich: Switzerland is probing news reports that the US Central Intelligence Agency and West Germany's spy service used a Swiss company's encryption technology to covertly crack other nations' top-secret messages, the Swiss defence ministry said.
The company, called Crypto AG, sold code-making equipment to Iran, Latin American nations, India, Pakistan and dozens of other countries. The technology was modified to let the CIA and Germany's BND break codes, the Washington Post reported along with German and Swiss broadcasters ZDF and Old news for some, but it's the first time that I've seen it acknowledged in the major media; this would be the Enigma, of course.

As another followup (and I'm not trying to turn this into a C forum), but can anyone think of a way to flip an n-bit word around i.e. LSB becomes MSB etc?
Assume that "n" is not necessarily a power of 2, just for generality; the best that I can think of is a 1-bit wide stack.
After much reading, it seems that most (if not all) crypto systems assume that powers of 2 are somehow magical, because of today's computers.
