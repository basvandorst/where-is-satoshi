The security industry suffers from the same "magical potions"
syndrome, and everyone wants quick solutions and knobs to their
security issues. That drives these crazy (to some extent) "security
checkers", compliance requirements, and more and more humans
willing/wanting to do less and less work. Very few realize actual
security work is incredibly dull and boring, and doesn't involve knobs
but requires a lot of careful planning, and a thoughtful
implementation to get stuff right.
Well, the only thing you can do is change the configuration to the
liking of the "virtue signaling machine", else you'd be cancelled! :-P
Of course, if it is your setup, designed and operated by you alone,
then there is a lot of flexibility in terms of educating yourself and
deciding which configuration is actually secure. If it is a customer,
then you are mostly out of luck - compliance with the virtue signaling
machine is mandatory (most of the time).
