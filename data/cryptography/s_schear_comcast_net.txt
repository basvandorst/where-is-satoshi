The problems implementing reliable crypto seem to parallel the problems which plagued early digital logic design.  Although digital logic operates as if only zeros and ones exist, in fact the physics underlying the circuit components is analog.  Until technologists developed SSI, MSI and later LSI circuits, which pretty effectively "walled off" the analog world, engineers were forever chasing analog demons in their digital designs.  Now these problems generally appear only when circuits or their environment (e.g., speed, temperature and voltage) exceed design parameters.
Mark Miller's approach using "E" may be one approach for applying the "walling off" practiced in digital design for security.

While IANL, it seems that the whole anonymity game has a flaw that doesn't even require a totalitarian regime. I would direct you to the various laws in the US (to pick a random example :) regarding conspiracy. Subscribing to an anonymity service might not become illegal, but if anyone in your "crowd" was performing an illegal action you may be guilty of conspiracy to commit this action.  You were explicitly trying to assist someone to avoid lawful detection of illegal activity, therefore you are in danger of being charged with conspiracy to commit the illegal act (even if the overt act was never successfully completed, which is where things could get really surreal for the remailer/crowds/proxy groups.) It is also worth noting that the burden of proof in a conspiracy trial is substantially lower than for other cases...
I too ANAL, but I think the prosecution would have to prove that you knew or should have known that your system was being used specific illegal acts.  Just knowing that someone "might" use your link to illegal purposes is insufficient.

@_subject: The RIAA Succeeds Where the CypherPunks Failed  
I'm not sure if Clay ever hung out on the cypherpunks list.  None of this comes as a surprise.  Most knew early on that widespread adoption of crypto would require a killer app and that cypherpunks were not delivering these apps because one could not predict what they would be.  They would surely not be PGP and other encrypted email nor digital cash unless and until there was a small but lucrative market that could be addressed by such technology or a large market with broad citizen support.  That file sharing could be it was also recognized a long time ago on the cypherpunks list.
One interesting aspect of the current arms war being fought between consumers determined to ignore copyright, their technological helpers in the development community and the RIAA/MPAA is a possible resurgence of interest in non-file sharing P2P architectures.  By this I mean schemes where the information is distributed among sharing participants in a fashion where each holds only a portion of the desired file in a form not identifiable as such by individual users.
Freenet and MNet (previously Mojo Nation) both use such an approach.  They create an Internet RAID drive cluster across the storage participants have offered to the sharing system.  Individual users are not associated with offering individual files, they simply have offered storage for data the content of which they know not.  User downloads from such systems are, of course, organized as individually identifiable files, but these are separately stored and not exposed outside their PCs.  "NetRAID" P2P approaches have suffered from complexity and stability problems which greatly affected their popularity, but there is reason to believe that such shortcomings may soon be a thing of the past.
Another aspect of this is what it portends for the future.  If, as Clay suggests, the current situation is like Prohibition from citizen perspective can we expect a similar repeal of government surveillance?  If not, what will happen as large numbers of citizens adopt P2P systems that not only flaunt copyright law but communications more dear to those in power?

@_subject: hackers have broken into GPRS billing 
Some time today (October 2th), the GPRS world will reveal that it has a security vulnerability which has seen an undisclosed number of its customers ripped off. They've been trapped into connecting to malicious content servers, by hackers penetrating the billing system. The first international phone company to admit that they have installed a solution - one offered by Check Point - will be the German phone provider, E-Plus.
The scam is called "the over-billing attack." It works quite simply because of a link from the Internet world - unregulated - to the normally tightly regulated GSM planet. "Network administrators face an exponential onslaught of attacks that to date have traditionally been confined to the world of wire line data," was the summary from Check Point.
There are lots of potential issues, but the one which has forced the phone networks to acknowledge that there is a problem, is a scam where a company obtains IP addresses that the GPRS operators own, in the "cellular pool" and start pinging those addresses. When one of them responds, the scam operator knows that a user has been assigned the address. And, unbelievably, there was nothing to stop them simply providing services direct to that IP address - and taking the money out of the GPRS billing system to pay for it. The network, typically, only found out about the attack weeks later, when the angry customer queried the service provided, and insisted that they had not signed up for it.
Getting the IP address list costs the crook no more than it takes to log onto the GPRS network with a data call, and getting assigned an address by a perfectly standard DHCP server inside the operator's network.
Check Point hasn't revealed specifics of how it blocks this attack, but the solution is based on its Firewall-1 software, which is already installed in most cellular networks. "The problem could be fixed by changing the hardware," said a spokesman for Check Point. "But that would take a year to implement, and would require hardware changes in virtually every network operator's equipment. The alternative is to use the knowledge in the GPRS firewall to implement an action in the IP firewall."
The solution does require the operator to run Firewall-1 on its Internet equipment as well as its GPRS servers. Once that is in place, Checkpoint has a single mnagement architecture for all its firewalls. "Our preferred solution is to write a rule that says: 'I have now closed this session on my GPRS side, so tell the IP firewall to look for any IP sessions with this IP address, and close them'," said a Check Point executive. Check Point expects several other announcements from phone network operators in the coming weeks.
The problem isn't limited to GPRS. Any mobile network that is internally trusted - and that includes next-level technology like UMTS 3G networks - will face similar threats when linking its internal, trusting network to the free-for-all that is the Internet, and will have to adopt similar solutions, says Check Point. "The vulnerability also applies between data networks. The GPRS Transfer Protocol, GTP, provides no security to protect the communications between GPRS networks," says the company in its sales blurbs. "So the GPRS/UMTS network is at risk, both from its own subscribers, and from its partner networks." Details from Check Point itself

@_subject: Digital cash and campaign finance reform 
Everyone knows that money is the life blood of politics.  The topic of campaign finance reform in the U.S. has been on and off the front burner of the major media, for decades.  Although the ability of citizens and corporations to support the candidates and parties of their choice can be a positive political force, the ability of political contributors to buy access and influence legislation is probably the major source of governmental corruption.  Despite some, apparently, honest efforts at limiting these legal payoffs there has been little real progress.  The challenge is to encourage "neutral" campaign contributions.  Perhaps technology could lend a hand.
One of the features of Chaimian digital cash is unlinkability.  Normally, this has been viewed from the perspective of the payer and payee not wishing to be linked to a transaction.  But it also follows that that the payee can be prevented from learning the identity of the payee even if they wished.  Since the final payee in politics is either the candidate or the party, this lack of knowledge could make it much more difficult for the money to be involved in influence peddling and quid pro quo back room deals.
By combining a mandated digital cash system for contributions, a cap on the size of each individual contribution (perhaps as small as $100), randomized delays (perhaps up to a few weeks) in the "posting" of each transaction to the account of the counter party, it could create mix conditions which would thwart the ability of contributors to easily convince candidates and parties that they were the source of particular funds and therefore entitled to special treatment.

The major problem facing Hollywood in protecting their HD content is that it runs smack up against an installed base of millions of HDTVs with only ACV (analog component video), including mine.  These consumers were promised by the FCC that they would not be left to twist in the wind when newer set-top-box to TV connections evolved and it does not appear technically practical to retrofit these sets to accommodate encrypted DVI or Firewire inputs.  The FCC has already stated they do not support broadcast flags for pay content and unless they back-peddle on this Hollywood appears to have only three other options: restrict the availability of HD content to cable broadcasters, prevent the sale of devices that can capture HD quality content from ACV, or insist that the resolution of ACV signals be degraded when "copy restricted" content is being broadcast.
The first will bring great howls from existing HDTV owners with only ACV.  The second is probably impractical since illegal devices (little more than 3-channel A-D converters on a PCI card) are sure to be produced and only a small number in the hands of skilled movie releasing groups are required to widely disseminate their content via the Internet.  The third option is also sure to bring major complaints from existing set owners.

What happens to the quantum information ingested by a black hole? In 1997, Thorne and Hawking argued that information swallowed by a black hole is forever hidden, despite the fact that these dense objects do emit a peculiar kind of radiation and eventually evaporate. Preskill countered that for quantum mechanics to remain valid, the theory mandates that the information has to be released from the evaporating black hole in some fashion. Although Hawking conceded in 2004, the disagreement between Preskill and Thorne still stands.
Smolin and Oppenheim now find that one of the main assertions made about black holes may be flawed. It is often assumed that as the black hole evaporates, all of the information gets stored in the remnant until the very end, at which point the information is either released or else disappears forever. Instead, Smolin and Oppenheim suggest that the information is distributed among the quanta thatescape during evaporation, but is encrypted and thus effectively locked away.
The catch is that it can only be accessed with the help of the quanta released when the black hole disappears, in much the same way as a cryptographic key unlocks a coded message. The result offers a link between general relativity and quantum cryptography. ? DV

As governments widen their definitions of just who is a potential threat it makes increasing sense for citizens engaged in previous innocuous activities (especially political and financial privacy) to protect their data from being useful if seized.  This goes double for those operating privacy-oriented services and their servers.  As an example, when TOR servers were recently seized in German raids (with the implication that they were being used as conduits for child porn) the police knew enough to only take the hot-swap drives (which were encrypted and therefore paper weights after removal) if only for show.

Here is the situation.  An on-line financial service, for example a DBC (Digital Bearer Certificate), operator wishes his meat space identity, physical whereabouts, the transaction servers and at least some of the location(s) of the service's asset backing to remain secret.  The service provides frequent, maybe even real-time, data on its asset backing versus currency in circulation. The operator wishes to provide some assurance to his clients that the backing and the amount of currency in circulation are in close agreement.  The mint's backing need not be in a single location nor in the sole possession of the operator.
I realize this is a governance question but I suspect that crypto/data security may play a key role.
Some questions:
If independent auditors are used do they need to know the operator's What aspects of good governance can be brought to bear on this situation so that the operator's interests are more aligned with its clients?
Has anyone explored this from a math-crypto view?
If the backing is distributed among a multitude of holders (e.g., in a fashion similar to how Lloyds backs their insurance empire), who's identities are kept secret until audit time and then only a few, randomly selected, names and claimed deposit amounts are revealed to the auditors, might this statistical sampling and the totals projected from the results be a reasonable replacement for 'full asset' audit?  To protect the identities of the holders could a complete list of the hashes of each name and claimed deposit be revealed to the auditors, who then select M of N hashes whereupon the operator reveals only those identities and claimed deposits work cryptographically?

As we have seen in the prosecutions of large corporation officers knowing their identity is no guarantee that stakeholders will not be defrauded.  Can you explain why knowing the server whereabouts is required?  Certainly there are cryptographically sound ways (e.g., time stamps from independent and trusted sources, hash chaining, etc.) that anon DBC mints can provide transaction logs that can be publicly examined and verified without ever touching the server.
The scenario described and method I proposed I think do address the identification of assets.  I maintain that random sampling can, when properly carried out, provide a mathematically sound confidence of the total size of assets.

How about this method?
1.) Auditors meet at a defined place and time.
2.) Courier arrives and presents a fraction N of M of the backing, once at a time, to the auditors
3.) Auditors verify the fraction, account for it and enclose it in a container with a unique hard to forge seal
4.) Courier leaves
5.) Step 2-4 are repeated until the total of M has been presented to the 6.) In the second round, the auditors request the same fractions N of M again. Not all N have to be presented, but can be
7.) One after another the couriers with the respective fractions present them again to the auditors
8.) The auditors verify the seals, and remove them
9.) The couriers leave
There are two disadvantages to the process:
1.) It takes quite some time.
2.) It is expensive
The advantages are:
1.) It is secure for the auditors and the operators
2.) It presents the full backing

For those with higher-performance PCs for playback, broadband connections and who know how to burn a single- or dual layer DVD, the content is there for the talking.
A new generation of HD media players (initially from offshore consumer electronics and networking companies, for example, Cisco/LinkSys) are poised to enter the market.  These appliances will allow playback of all the common HD encoded media, including those ripped from the commercial HD discs.

I guess I wasn't clear.  Unlike ripping and copying DVD's bit-for-bit, content ripped from H-DVDs and BluRay discs are first distributed as simply unencrypted copies.  Watching this content means you will probably do so from your PC (e.g., using a curent version of Power DVD) as burning a bit-for-bit HD DVD/BluRay is either not available or economically practical.  Later, HD videophiles re-encode the content using the same advanced coders (i.e., H./X/264 andVC1) so at least the feature movie can be stored on a dual layer DVD.  Despite the smaller data size of the DVD (about 8.5 GB) vs. HD media (20+ GB) the quality of playback is impressive, good enough for all but the most discerning Home Theater buff.

@_subject: Fwd: [gsc] Digital cache with extended features 
[Some interesting thinking going on.  Wasn't there some similar ideas presented/published at a past FC conference?]
Reply-To: gold-silver-crypto at rayservers.com
It seems that, finally, the pieces fit together, and although the design
is not as good as for account based systems, it's good enough.
I have been pondering for some time about digital cash, but the pieces
never fit. However, with a special design, it's possible to integrate
the necessary features in digital coins.
Basically, it's necessary for the owner of a coin to create the coin
(core), blind it and send it to the mint for signing. In the core, the
user must include a hash for a "coin appendix". The coin appendix
includes various information, but the most important is the asymmetric
public key pair of the recipient.
The coin appendix is not sent to the mint so that it would not serve
later to associate exchanges. However, when a coin is exchanged, the
coin appendix must be sent to the mint. And since its hash is already in
the signed coin, it's certain that the correct coin appendix is
associated with the coin.
The mint guarantees to exchange the coin only if the signature of the
exchange request is verified by the key pair which is in the coin
This way, the spender can be sure that only the intended recipient can
later spend the coin, and also have the best thing next to a proof of
payment. If an online store publishes its public key pair, then even if
the store claims to never have received the coin, the spender can simply
publish coin (note that only the store can spend the coin, so everyone
can see the coin) and tell the store to take it.
This methods provides two features in one step: proof of payment and
ability of organizations to secure every coin they receive with the
public identity of the organization (not of individual members).
A problem of this method is that the mint can monitor how much currency
a specific digital identity exchanges. Of course, the mint can't know
the total amount of currency received by a digital identity because
there is no need to reissue a coin, and the recipient might never
exchange some coins he received.
Of course, everybody can just change their asymmetric key pair, but
since they need to publish it, it can still be monitored.
Now, there is certainly no need to use identities for recipients, but in
practice most people would do it.
The coin appendix could also contain a descriptor of its inheritors. But
the problem here is that the coin would have to be put in an escrow
service. It's not a problem if anybody sees it, because only it's
current owner can exchange it, and in the future (after a date specified
in the descriptor) only its intended inheritors can exchange it.
The owner has to consider that if he still lives when the coin is about
to enter its inheritable time frame, he must exchange it before that
time and set a new date for inheritance.
The coin appendix could also include an escrow identity. The mint must
then guarantee to exchange the coin only if it's accompanied by a signed
certificate from the escrow service.
The coin appendix could also include a recovery identity, usually that
of the original owner. This way, if the recipient never uses the coin
because he dies, for example, the spender can take it back after a
specified date. But this means that users must reissue the coins (for
themselves) they receive, before the recovery date comes. Sure, the
recovery date could be a year after the payment, but that still means
that there has to be a reissue.
The actual implementation of this design, requires two independent parts
of the coin appendix, and therefore two hashes:
* One part which contains the identity of the owner of the coin. This
part is sent to the mint when the owner spends the coin.
* One part which contains the identities of the inheritors of the coin.
This part is sent to the mint when an inheritor reissues the coin.
This way, inheritors are visible to the mint only when they actually
All nice and cozy, but this design means that each transaction would
take on average 1 to 2 seconds for the mint, plus about 8 times more
traffic than for account based systems. (This considers that coin
denominations are power of 2, so as to minimize the number of coins from
each transaction.)
One thing I am still unable to solve is how to hide coins. With account
based systems it is simple: each "visible" account from the identity
manager application had, automatically created, a hidden account (well,
rather data which looked random to anyone without the right passphrase).
I still have to think about these things to see if it's a path worth

@_subject: Ross Anderson paper on fraud, risk and nonbank payment systems 
[Read the paper here:   Very interesting stuff, but not likely new to most here.]
The Federal Reserve commissioned me to research and write a
paper on fraud, risk and nonbank payment systems. I found that
phishing is facilitated by payment systems like eGold and Western
Union which make the recovery of stolen funds more difficult.
Traditional payment systems like cheques and credit card payments
are revocable; cheques can bounce and credit card charges can be
charged back. However some modern systems provide irrevocability
without charging an appropriate risk premium, and this attracts
the bad guys. (After I submitted the paper, and before it was
presented on Friday, eGold was indicted.)
I also became convinced that the financial market controls used
to fight fraud, money laundering and terrorist finance have
become unbalanced as they have been beefed up post-9/11. The
modern obsession with 'identity' - of asking even poor people
living in huts in Africa for an ID document and two utility
bills before they can open a bank account - is not only ridiculous
and often discriminatory. It's led banks and regulators to take
their eye off the ball, and to replace risk reduction with due
In real life, following the money is just as important as following
the man. It's time for the system to be rebalanced.
