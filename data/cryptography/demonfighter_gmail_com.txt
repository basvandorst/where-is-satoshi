When would that be the case?
The only defensible situations I can think of in which a
non-crypto-specialist programmer would need to write crypto routines
would be an uncommon OS or hardware, or a new or rare programming
language which doesn't have libraries available from SourceForge etc.
Or maybe implementing an algorithm that's new enough it doesn't have a
decent free implementation, but I'm not sure such an algorithm should
be used in production code.
Indefensible situations include the programmer wanting to write his
own crypto because it's cool or because he just knows he can do better
than all the specialists (in which case he's too arrogant or ignorant
to benefit from a common gotchas list) or the manager telling the
programmer to implement it himself for some bad reason (in which case
the programmer should explain why that's a bad idea).

thought of that when she was besetting us with droughts and floods and

This is so, in the ideal. But "if everyone would only..." never seems
to work out in practice. Better to rely on what you can on your own or
with a small group.
In response to Hadmut's question, for instance, I'd hide the crypto
app by renaming the executable. This wouldn't work for a complex app
like PGP Suite but would suffice for a simple app. Rename the
encrypted files as well and you're fairly safe. (I've consulted with
firms that do disk drive analysis. From what I've seen, unless the
application name or the data file extensions are in a known list, they
won't be seen. But my work has been in the realm of civil suits,
contract disputes, SEC claims, and the like; the investigators might
be more thorough when trying to nail someone for kiddie porn.)
Or use another app which by the way has crypto. Winzip apparently has
some implementation flaws
( ) but a quick
google doesn't show anything but brute force and dictionary attacks
against WinRar.

Yes, I could, and have. Presumably you could. Ben Laurie probably
could blindfolded with both hands tied behind his back. But Alice
Philanderer, Bob Pedophile, Charlie Terrorist, and Generic Joe User
can't. Your alternative is more practical than "if everybody would
xxx" (sorry, Ian) but still not good enough. If only techies are able
to protect themselves from the JBTs, then merely being a techie will
be grounds for suspicion. (As well as throwing our non-programming brethren to the wolves.)
The only realistic solutions are those which allow the concerned but
non-technical user to take measures to protect himself against the
perceived threat, without requiring major changes to human nature or
to society.
As it happens, I have really good test cases to refine my solutions:
my extended family is a bunch of mountain hicks with internet access.

the digital file was a "document" rather than "source code", it
skirted the then laws concerning export.
That's wouldn't help here. Nowadays any source code I write which
might meet with official disapproval resides encrypted on my hard
drive. I distribute it pseudonymously. (crypto sign the tgz and the
email cover letter, then email it through an anonymizer.) It won't do
me much good for job hunting or other reputation-based benefits, but
it should keep me out of legal trouble.
For now. But, as has been asked before by people I used to consider

But, but..Java is the be-all end-all!
Three years ago I advised a business/tech guy to avoid Java for crypto
and related purposes. I'll revise that somewhat in light of greater
experience and developments: Java is ok if you control the platform
it's running on and if the programmers were very careful. In practice,
that means I'd be willing to do the server-side programming in Java if
I (or my employer or client) controlled the server. I'm not happy
about doing client-side programming in Java for arbitrary users, but
users in a controlled business environment is ok. From a user's
perspective, I'd be _really_ cautious about using a crypto app written
in Java.
FWIW, lately I've been earning my daily bread with Java server-side
programming. Fortunately for me, it's been mostly crap work, where it
doesn't really matter if data leaks or someone cracks in. Considering
that I don't control any of the J2EE or database servers and for the
most part they're administered by poorly-trained monkeys, I'd have a
really tough ethical call if my clients wanted me to do some work
where security really mattered.

Other important questions for programmers are, how good are you? How
good does the process allow you to be?
My answers are, I'm quite a good programmer. (Pardon the ego.) I'm
careful and methodical and very seldom have buffer overruns or unfreed
memory even in my first drafts. For me, my expected code quality in C
and C++ is balanced against the black box behaviour of Java's runtime
engine. (To be clear: I don't suspect Sun of putting back doors in
their engine.) And I'm experienced enough and old enough that I can
hold my own in pissing contests with project managers who want to cut
corners in order to ship a day earlier.
Implementation quality could be considered in the threat model. I've
generally taken the programmers into account when designing a system,
but I hadn't explicitly thought of well-meaning-but-incompetent
programmers as part of the threat. Guess I should.

Yes, teach the concept and the intent.
As for using it in practice, I'm not so sure. Knuth created literate
programming to address some of Pascal's problems, in particular the
requirement that program elements be presented in a rigid order and in a
single source file. The solution is not always appropriate if your
programming language of choice does not have this limitation.
Forcing or even encouraging developers to write a program in literate style
actually results in a worse product than letting them write in whatever
unstructured way and document in whatever haphazard way they normally do.
An awful lot of programmers can't or won't organize their thoughts on a
program or module in a logical, ordered fashion which lends itself to
comprehension by others. An awful lot of programmers can't or won't write
natural-language text that makes sense, let alone that anyone would want to
read. An awful lot of programmers aren't conscientious enough to update
text when they update code. If you think that outdated and inaccurate
inline comments are bad, you've seen nothing until you've seen a literate
program which has been "maintained" for a few months by three developers,
two of whom won't work on the text unless forced.
(Now, you could make the argument that programmers who can't or won't
organize their thoughts logically should be fired, and I do make that
argument, but that's a separate topic. And the same for those who don't
keep code comments up to date.)
JavaDoc and its brethren take much inspiration from literate programming.
If written properly, the generated documentation can come close to a
book-style literate program. On most coding teams, I figure this is as good
as we're likely to get.

a mediocre job that it's barely worth the trouble; you don't have many
people left.  It's a real challenge.
I haven't had great success in getting good Javadoc out of the usual run of
developers. Some of that is inability, some is unwillingness.
To play off of what Jerry and Stephan and tbp-crypto say, I'm generally in
favor of getting rid of developers who just don't cut it.
Lumpenprogrammers, which is by far the majority of what I encounter, are a
net drag on a project or a team. Inability or refusal to document what
they're doing so that other developers can understand it is just one aspect
of lumpen-ness.
This applies to non-critical application and library development. I don't
have any experience with avionics or medical software and not much in
writing real-world crypto libraries, but I would think that getting rid of
the drags would be even more important here.

wouldn't be at all surprised to find an agreement being put into place,
with the assurance mechanism being revealed to be broken shortly after it's
implemented or (worse) being revealed years later to have been broken
before implementation.

Agreed. Any plan which relies on "if only everyone would behave

with technology, not laws or education. I, too, fail to see any way to make
this happen. Making phish-proof tools available hasn't worked.
I'd guess that getting rid of the tight integration between MS Windows, IE,
and MS Office would solve most of the problem, but I don't see that
happening -- it's too conveeeeenient for the users. A big corporation
losing big bucks might lead to a policy of firing anyone who falls for a
phishing attack. Ian's mention of a government being nailed because an
employee fell for one might do the trick.
Conceivably, an artificial intelligence sitting between the user and the
links he clicks would do it. I'm not confident of this. The providers of
the back-end processing for such AIs as we have now do not seem to be any
more secure than any other business.
