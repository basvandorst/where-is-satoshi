@_subject: [Cryptography] GCHQ [request for crypto keys] Forced Secure Email 
Security firm CertiVox forced to pull its PrivateSky secure email product
after GCHQ forced its hand over users' data.
PrivateSky was shut down at the beginning of the year after introducing a
web-based version in beta and for Outlook and had "tens of thousands of
heavily active users".
B rian Spector, CEO of CertiVox, told IT Security Guru: "Towards the end of
2012, we heard from the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC), a
division of GCHQ and a liaison with the Home Office, [that] they wanted the
keys to decrypt the customer data. We did it before Lavabit and Silent
Circle and it was before Snowden happened.
"It is the same in the USA with FISMA, and it is essentially a national
security warrant. So in late 2012 we had the choice to make - either
architect the world's most secure encryption system on the planet, so
secure that CertiVox cannot see your data, or spend ?500,000 building a
backdoor into the system to mainline data to GCHQ so they can mainline it
over to the NSA.
"It would be anti-ethical to the values and message we are selling our
customers in the first place."

Do key signing parties even happen much anymore? The last time I saw
one advertised was around PGP 2.6!
I can sign the public keys of people I personally know without a key
signing party. :-)
For many purposes I don't care about a person's official, legal
identity, but I do want to communicate with a particular persona.
For instance at DefCon or CCC I neither know or care whether someone
identifies themselves to me by their legal name or hacker handle, but
it is very useful to know & authenticate that they are in control of a
private PGP/GPG key in that name on a particular date.

My fault, sorry. Though I think it was illuminating to uncover that key signing
seems more common within certain types of communities. For PGP key
signing I still think ownership of the email address/contact details
being signed
is sufficient criteria, but if a key maybe used to say sign legal contracts then
ID requirements are higher. Maybe these levels of knowledge can be captured
at signing.
Spreading the use of strong crypto is good. :-)
My experience of PGP in a corporate setting is that keys are signed by
the company's keyserver & that additional keys to encrypt to are added.
I would be more inclined to share my (PGP) key and sign others if it was
simple to do, such as touching 2 NFC enabled mobile phones together.

I think you a overestimating how much real entropy you will collect this
If you the adversaries you are concerned about are moderately resourced
they could be able to model this entropy source.
There are a relatively small number of CPU clock frequencies in wide
use and variations on mains frequency are easily discoverable by others,
e.g. other servers at your co-lo. Also, at least in the UK, there are public
records of these variations such as;

@_subject: [Cryptography] Der Spiegel: "NSA Can Spy on Smart Phone Data" 
The Spiegel article perhaps contains a key to this capability:
"In the internal documents, experts boast about successful access to
iPhone data in instances where the NSA is able to infiltrate the
computer a person uses to sync their iPhone."
I have not seen security measures such as requiring a password from
the connected computer to a phone in order to access data such as
contact lists, SMS history, ..
This is probably done simply in order to provide maximum convenience
to end users.
