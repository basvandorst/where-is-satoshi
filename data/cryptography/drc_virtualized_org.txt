Oh, sure it does.
If you're talking about zone walking, that was addressed with NSEC3. DNSSEC was designed to address the vulnerability caused by a limited (16-bit) identifier space in the original DNS protocol specification, nothing more.  In that, I would argue DNSSEC does a reasonable job -- it ensures that data provided by the authoritative server hasn't been modified in flight to the validating resolver.  As far as I know, no one ever claimed or even suggested it would provide confidentiality.  However, if you have a validating resolver and a properly configured trust anchor and are requesting data from a signed zone (> 50% of the top-level domains are now DNSSEC-signed), you are not subject to spoofing attacks as the validator will drop spoofed responses.
While I'm generally not considered a 'lover' of DNSSEC (to put it mildly), I do think it is less offensive than the alternative of not having authenticatable responses (regardless of the transport of those responses). More interestingly, DNSSEC can potentially provide a basis for an alternative PKI to the X.509 PKI. I personally would see that as a positive.

Discussions of at least one aspect of this already in progress, see:

I'm not clear what this has to do with DNSSEC, other than it was implemented at the same time as Sonic's 'RBZ' service (by which I suspect you mean RPZ, which is BIND's "Response Policy Zone" -- a technology ISC implemented that facilitates the rewriting of responses according to (recursive operator's) policy).
If you are using your ISP's resolver, you are explicitly granting them a vast amount of trust: they (or whoever might influence them) can collect vast amounts of meta data and can have essentially complete control over any connection you might try to make. I sometimes get the impression that people don't fully understand the level of trust we're talking about here. If you need a refresher, see  starting at slide 45.
It really isn't that hard to run your own DNSSEC-validating resolver. BIND or Unbound ( aren't that hard to set up.
I don't believe ISPs in general have common carrier status (at least yet, see discussions about net neutrality).

Not DNSSEC-authenticated.
Not really.
Data between the resolver and the client application is not protected by DNSSEC.  And, of course, the resolver can do anything it wants to the data it returns to the client application.  DNSSEC can best be seen as protecting the integrity of the data that is entered into the resolver's cache.
The best (IMHO) way to protect that data is to run your own validating resolver locally (on the same machine as the client application).
