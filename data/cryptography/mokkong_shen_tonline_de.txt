@_subject: [Cryptography] Coded sentences 
A codebook in classical crypto is a mapping from a chosen number of
normal or nonsense words to the corresponding intended words or even
phrases and sentences. Wouldn't a generalization of that idea, namely a
mapping from certain types of sentences to the corresponding intended
phrases or sentences, be much more versatile and useful in practice?
I mean e.g. a rather mundane sentence expressing the fact that some
friends came to visit us and we have together done something and that
they'll further travel to somewhere could be written in a quite large
number of different ways textually via varying the names of the
visitors and what we have jointly done etc. as well as via varying the
grammatical constructions of the sentence.

@_subject: [Cryptography] On improving the performance of the classical 
The classical Playfair cipher and its variant "two square cipher"
(employing two Playfair matrices, used in WWII) are obviously too weak
to be practically used today. We propose to examine whether some better
and useful variants could exist that are not entirely out of the bounds
of work that could feasibly be done by human operators in practice.
Two potential modifications suggest themselves: (1) Use multiple
rounds, (2) use more key materials.
After certain experimentations, the following variant seems to be a
fairly optimal one:
(1) The plaintext is natural language text in the lower-case alphabet,
     i.e. of size 26.
(2) The ciphertext alphabet is the lower-case alphabet plus e.g.
     "TSAMCI", i.e. of size 32.
(3) Four Playfair matrices of size 4*8 are used, being placed in two
     rows, one above the other. These contain pseudo-random permutations
     of the alphabet of (2) and are designated as matrix 1 - 4, counting
     from the upper-left matrix in clockwise direction.
(4) To encrypt a plaintext pair (u1, u2), one determines a straight
     line from u1 in matrix 1 to u2 in matrix 3 and find the
     corresponding straight line from v1 in matrix 2 to v2 in matrix 4
     such that they form the diagonals of a rectangle. (v1, v2) is then
     the ciphertext pair. (This is analogous to the general rule of the
     original Playfair.)
(5) In encryption processing, successive pairs are taken overlapped,
     with the encrpyted characters immediately replacing the original
     ones (with wrapping around at the end of the sequence). That is, if
     the input sequence is abcd...., one encrypts (a,b) to (A,B), then
     (B,c) to (B',C), then (C,d) to (C',D), ...., resulting in
     AB'C'D'.....
To test the performance of the scheme, we took the book "A Tale of Two
Cities" from Project Gutenberg and took out the alphabetical characters
(upper-case characters are converted to lower-case ones), obtaining
thus a plaintext sequence. Using the alphabet of (2), which is of size
32, each character was converted to 5 bits and the the bit sequence
resulting was subjected to Maurer's Universal Test. Next we obtained
the ciphertext sequence from the plaintext sequence according to the
scheme as described above for up to 8 rounds, the resulting sequences
were subjected to Maurer's Universal Test in the same manner as the
plaintext sequence.
The test statistics obtained are as follows (for L=8, rho=0.01 the
values should be in [7.178, 7.189]):
Plaintext: 6.716
Ciphertext (first row is the number of rounds done):
      1       2       3       4       5       6       7       8
    7.124   7.165   7.181   7.179   7.181   7.189   7.185   7.183
This indicates that with 3 rounds the encryption processing should be
practically satisfactory and means that, since in each round twice the
number of pairs are taken in comparison to the original Playfair, the
scheme necessitates 6 times the amount of work and 4 times the key
materials of the original Playfair (for 4*8 matrix).

[Addendum:] We note incidentally that, since Playfair is a substitution, it is generally profitable, if desired, to combine the
scheme with transpositions, e.g. the common columnar transposition or
preferrably its variant of the RS44-type, as pre-prosessing and/or
(An RS44-type of transposition can be conveniently specified either via
the matrix of a certain crossword puzzle in a newspaper or journal or
via filling a matrix with a certain natural language sentence and
choosing to have the locations of certain alphabetical characters as
black squares such that there would roughly be a certain desired
percentage of rather randomly distributed squares of the matrix that
are black.)

@_subject: [Cryptography] Desirability of standard reference pseudo-codes for 
There is a web site weakdh.org, whose name alone would certainly cause
some feeling of uncertainty in using DH among people who are not
experts IMHO.
In general, i.e. not specifically concerning DH, how is the key sizes
issue being treated in practice today? There are a number of different
recommendations by experts and government institutions like NIST. But
which is the best recommendation and, above all, how much trust should
one have towards these in our era following revelations of Snowden and
other activists? Also IMHO unsatisfying for the common users of
IT-security software is history of the following kind: A certain
earlier recommended key size was found to be insufficient due to a
later discovered cause like logjam attack in the case of DH and one
is simply told that from now on one should use another larger key size
and everything would be ok. But isn't that also a solid testimony of
the fact that in all the time during which the old key size was in
vogue the communications of the users were insecure?
I believe it is highly desirable to mitigate as far as possible the
risks/disadvantages arising in this context via having for all
essential components of IT-security software compact but complete
(i.e. useful for guiding implementations) standard reference
pseudo-codes, e.g. of the kind for AES as given in NIST FIPS-197, that
are thorougly examined by a sufficiently large number of international
experts and published in the standard documents of ISO (in contrast to
publications of a national institution which could eventually be
influenced by some specific national interests). Parameters of such
codes, in particular e.g. the minimum key size of DH, could then be
continuously updated in case of need via official documents issued as
a result of standing cooperative work of such experts. Certainly this
can't be an ideal solution, as long as humans err and unexpected
cryptanalytical breakthroughs can by nature never be ruled out, but
is nonetheless apparently an optimal compromise for the practice.
Once such standard reference pseudo-codes are available, concrete
open-source implementations that are semantically equivalent to them
can be done and certified to be correct by the individual national
standardization bodies and/or IT professional associations. Any common
user could then have the capability to best choose an implementation
for his use, employing a criterion e.g. based on the number of
certificates that an implementation has obtained.

IMHO the main essence of a Feistel cipher of block length n is the
working of a non-linear function F that is applied to the two halves
of the block of length n/2.
Now suppose a certain block cipher of block length n as well as two
keys of it are given. If one employs the given block cipher in the
sense of F on each half of a larger block of length 2n in parallel
(actually invoked alternatingly with the two keys) for a number of
rounds, one obtains evidently a new block cipher of Feistel genre
having doubled block length and requiring a doubled key length.
Could anything in general be said on the security (or insecurity)
of such a scheme?
It may be of interest to also examine the special case where the
two keys are identical. The scheme could apparently be useful if
a currently secure block cipher at a future timepoint becomes
insufficiently secure due to growth of adversary's computing power
(including the case when the dream of quantum computing comes true),
since it could obviate the necessity (or at least urgent necessity)
of an entirely new design of block cipher in response.
The scheme can be trivially generalized to achieve a block length of
the larger cipher of m*n (m >= 2) operating on m subblocks of length
n as follows, with E(K,P) denoting the given block cipher and K[*]
denoting the array of the keys:
for i in [1 .. number_of_rounds] do
   for j in [1 .. m] do
     subblock[(j mod m) + 1] ^= E(K[j], subblock[j])
Note that in case m is not fixed but the plaintext length is m*n (and
there is one or more keys) one obtains a special kind of block chaining
with the given block cipher.
Certainly there is an efficiency issue that needs to be examined for
practical applications of the scheme.

There are different reasons causing the representative to seek
instructions from the manager. For example, the lower limit of the
contract price originally given to the representative was dependent
on (1) assumed construction or manufacture details that could only
be exactly known by the representative at customer's site, (2)
the customer has modified the quantities of purchase in the mean

competitors), (3) assumed product delivery time does not correspond

wished-for amount, which the manager, if hard-pressed, would eventually
yet lower a little bit), etc. etc. That a mandated representative in
negotiations has occassionally to consult his chief is to my knowledge
fairly normal in commercial practice. Analogy could also be found in

A. K. Lenstra et al. in an extensive examination of the RSA moduli used in
practice ( p.10)
wrote that they "could not explain the relative frequencies and apprearance
of the occurrence of duplicate RSA moduli and depth one trees" found in
their study.
How could the high security risks arising from this direction be effectively
countered in the current actual practice of RSA applications on the It is obvious that with the fairly large size of the RSA moduli investigated
in the study, the probability of occurrence of shared prime factors in the
moduli should be very very small, if the software used is appropriately and
correctly written at all. Hence IMHO a highly possible, not to be ignored,
cause of the phenomenon reported could be that a certain non-open-source
RSA key generation software employed in practice contains a backdoor. With
PRNGs it is namely very simple to specify a set of N prime numbers (without
having to explicitly store them in the software) to be pseudo-randomly
selected for use in an RSA key generation session. N could be chosen by the
malice to his advantage to be fairly large without causing difficulties to
his purposes. For the set of N prime numbers can be all pre-generated by forming a list at his disposal to probe a given RSA modulus in order to find
his prime factor in case the modulus happens to have been generated by the
RSA software that contains his backdoor.
In view of the comparatively simple algorithmus involved, obviously it isn't
difficult from the viewpoint of software engineering to specify an RSA key
generation (reference) program unit in simple, sufficiently detailed
pseudo-code (cf. AES standard) that has a standard interface to its
environment. If this is ISO standardized, open-source implementations could
be certified independently by national standardization bodies and/or IT
professional associations of diverse countries of the world. While there is
nothing 100.00% perfect in the real world (excepting certain mathematical
theories that are logically impacable, though still contingent on their
axioms), the trustworthiness of such implementations will obviously become
higher, when their number of certifications obtained increases. In this
situation, at least a common end user doing encryption/decryption of his
personal communications could easily have a choice for his RSA key between such a certified implementation (which may not run very fast) and
another implementation that is not certified but runs faster and has lots
of convenience features.

@_subject: [Cryptography] How to counter the security risks of shared 
[Addendum] While in my OP the possibility of exploiting a certain kind of
backdoors was used to support my urgent plea of having a publically open-source software for RSA key generation, the realization of such
certifications would understandably anyway require much time and certainly not
be easy in practice.
In order however to render the issue in any case sensitive in the minds of all
those who really care for their own IT security, I like to stress the fact that
there are much more sophisticated schemes of embedding backdoors into
non-open-source RSA key generation software that lie clearly beyond the realm of studies of the kind done by A. K. Lenstra et al. In other words, the
security risks that are looming could in fact be extremely hideous and thus
outside of the consciousness of the victims at all.
One nice backdoor scheme of the said genre is due to maartin, who gave in an
Internet discussion many years ago a sketch of his idea, albeit in such short wordings that it was apparently not closely examined by the
readers at that time and henceforth entirely ignored. I recently remembered
maartin's idea and tried it out in an implementation sketched in the Suppose one generates RSA keys with modulus n = p*q > 2**mb for mb=2000.
Generate a pseudo-random comparatively small, say 256-bit, value head to be the
leading part of n. Use head as a parameter to uniquely generate a prime p of
mb//2 bits. Different ways of designing such a unique mapping are obviously
conceivable. In my implementation head is used to seed a PRNG to generate a
pseudo-random mb//2-bit value ptemp and one finds the next prime p after with Miller-Rabin. Let ltail = mb + 2 - 256. Generate a pseudo-random value tail
of ltail bits. Concatenate head and tail to be ntemp. With qtemp = ntemp//p find
the next prime q after qtemp with Miller-Rabin. Compute n = p*q. If n < which is of fairly low probability in practice, repeat the above procedure.
This way, the n generated will have its leading 256 bits identical to head.
Thus a person knowing this backdoor can simply get the value of head from n
and with it recover p in the way mentioned above and obtain then q and e and
d, i.e. everything of the original RSA key generation.
If any reader has a nice idea for an RSA backdoor, I should appreciate it very
much to learn it and would volunteer to attempt to do an implementation to
prove its practicality.

Completion of the protocol (i.e. after step 3) means that both

what your first paragraph above implies. Note that Bob certainly
can't do what you wrote, since after step 2 Alice hasn't yet

When a contract in digital from is to be signed online by Alice and
Bob, an issue concerning the fairness of the signing process crops up
as follows: If Alice first signs the document and sends it to Bob, it
means she has committed to something (e.g. ready to purchase an article
from Bob certain price). Bob can however, if he desires, at least
to some extent arbitrarily delay giving his digital signature, i.e.
having a period during which he has no corresponding commitment. This
is obviously unfair and thus to be avoided, if possible.
Noting that with visual cryptography a document can be separated into
two pieces such that they jointly can reproduce the original but
neither piece alone provides any information of the document, the
following protocol appears to well fulfill the requirements of fairness
in the present context.
(1) Alice formulates the contract document C and generates from it with
visual cryptography a pair (X, Y), signs X and with signcryption
(signed encryption) sends a message containing signed(Alice,X) and Y to
Bob. (We assume that signcryption of a message is authenticated, i.e.
it has integrity check. signed(Alice,X) denotes an X in the message
that is digitally signed by Alice.)
(2) Bob obtains C from (X, Y). If he finds C acceptable, he gives his
consent through signing X and Y and sending with signcryption
signed(Bob,X) and signed(Bob,Y) to Alice. Otherwise he asks Alice to
revise the docment and the protocol begins again from step (1).
(3) Alice checks that Bob has signed X and Y (i.e. not other values),
signs Y and releases C, signed(Alice,X), signed(Alice Y), signed(Bob,X)
and signed(Bob,Y) to the public.
Note that after step (2) Alice cannot innocently refuse to perform step
(3), since the pair (X,Y) stems from her. In other words, after step
(2) the contract is de facto completed.
Thus there is no time period during which one partner has full
commitment to C while the other has none and, if C is released to the
public, it is signed by both partners.
For comments and critiques I should be very grateful.

[I noticed that my OP of 10.06.2016 was not sufficiently well
formulated and may thus lead to misunderstandings. Allow me to present
a revised version in the following, which IMHO also answered some of
the critiques received.]
When a contract in digital from is to be signed online by Alice and
Bob, an issue concerning the fairness of the signing process crops up
as follows: If Alice first signs the document and sends it to Bob, it
means she has committed to something (e.g. ready to purchase an article
from Bob certain price), Bob can however, if he desires, at least
to some extent arbitrarily delay giving his digital signature, i.e.
having a period during which he has no corresponding commitment. This
is obviously unfair and thus to be avoided, if possible.
Noting that with visual cryptography a document can be separated into
two pieces such that they jointly can reproduce the original but
neither piece alone provides any information of the document, the
following protocol appears to well fulfill the requirements of fairness
in the present context.
In the following the convention is that signed(A, U) denotes U (as a
single piece) digitally signed by A and that A thereby commits to U and
that nothing else, e.g. simply a V in a message which as a whole is
signed, has the meaning of a commitment.
Step 1: Alice formulates a contract document C, generates with visual
cryptography a pair (X, Y), sends a message containing signed(Alice,X)
and Y to Bob and asks him to accept C within a certain reasonable time
period T1 and promises to complete the contract formality within a
reasonalble time period T2 in case Bob commits to C.
Step 2: In time period T1: Bob obtains C from (X, Y). If he can't
accept C, he informs Alice and the protocol begins again at step 1.
Otherwise he sends a message containing signed(Bob,X) and signed(Bob,Y)
to Alice and asks her to release C. (If Bob does nothing in T1, the
protocol begins again at step 1.)
Step 3: In time period T2: Alice examines whether Bob has signed the
correct stuff, i.e. whether he hadn't e.g. by mistake sent
signed(Bob,Z) in place of signed(Bob,X) with Z != X. If Bob had signed
the wrong stuff, she informs Bob and the protocol begins again at
step 1. Otherwise she releases C, signed(Alice,X), signed(Alice,Y),
signed(Bob,X) and signed(Bob,Y) to the public. (Alice is responsible
to complete step 3 in T2.)
The messages of step 1 and 2 are to be sent with signcryption, i.e.
encrypted with reciever's public key and signed by the sender, and with
authentication (integrity check).
Note that:
(a) In step 1 Alice has not committed to C. Since she proposes C in the
hope that Bob would accept it, it is natural that she must allow a time
period T1 during which Bob makes his decision. This is familiar also in
all other human transactions where one party takes the initiative to
suggest something to be done together and the other party agrees or
refuses. Thus there is no unfairness here.
(b) If Bob commits to C in step 2, then Alice is immediatly obliged
(responsible) to commit to C as well, since the pair (X, Y) stems from
herself. That is, C is virtually already valid. That the formlity may
take a time period T2 is familiar also in all other human transactions.

[My OP of 10.06.2016 was also posted to a few other groups and
discussed there. Below is a copy of the updated version there:]
When a contract in digital from is to be signed online by Alice and
Bob, an issue concerning the fairness of the signing process crops up
as follows: If Alice first signs the document and sends it to Bob, it
means she has committed to something (e.g. ready to purchase an article
from Bob certain price), Bob can however, if he desires, to some
extent delay giving his digital signature and thus have a certain
finite time interval during which he has no corresponding commitment.
This is obviously unfair and hence to be avoided, if possible.
Noting that with visual cryptography a document can be separated into
two pieces such that they jointly can reproduce the original but
neither piece alone provides any information of the document, we
propose the following protocol which well fulfills the requirements of
fairness in the present context.
In the following the convention is that signed(A, U) denotes U (as a
single piece) digitally signed by A and that A thereby commits to U and
that nothing else, e.g. simply a V in a message which as a whole is
signed, has the meaning of a commitment.
Step 1: Alice formulates a contract document C, generates with visual
cryptography a pair (X, Y), sends a message containing signed(Alice,X)
and Y to Bob and asks him to accept C before a certain day T in the
future and promises to complete the contract formality within a certain
time period TP in case Bob commits to C in step 2.
Step 2: Bob obtains C from (X, Y). If he can't accept C, he informs
Alice and the protocol begins again at step 1. Otherwise he sends a
message containing signed(Bob,X) and signed(Bob,Y) to Alice and asks
her to release C. (If Bob does nothing before T is reached, the
protocol begins again at step 1.)
Step 3: Alice examines whether Bob has signed the correct stuff, i.e.
whether he hadn't e.g. by mistake sent signed(Bob,Z) in place of
signed(Bob,X) with Z != X. If Bob had signed the wrong stuff, she
informs Bob and the protocol begins again at step 1. Otherwise she
releases C, signed(Alice,X), signed(Alice,Y), signed(Bob,X) and
signed(Bob,Y) to the public. (Alice is responsible to complete step 3
within TP.)
The messages of step 1 and 2 are to be sent with signcryption, i.e.
encrypted with reciever's public key and signed by the sender, and with
authentication (integrity check). Receipt acknowledgments are to be
requested for resolving eventual timing issues.
Note that:
(a) In step 1 Alice has not committed to C. Thus there can be no
unfairness of the nature mentioned above.
(b) If Bob commits to C in step 2, then Alice is immediatly obliged to
commit to C as well, since the pair (X, Y) stems from herself (hence
she couldn't eventually claim that C corresponds to (X, Z) with
Z != Y). That is, C is virtually already a valid document. Hence there
can be also here no unfairness of the nature mentioned above.
(c) Our protocol doesn't involve/need any trusted third party, which is
an advantage.
For comments and critiques I should be very grateful.
(For signcryption, see e.g. Example 3S in [Edited 18.06.2016]
[Addendum 19.06.2016] There are literatures which claim (if I have not
misinterpreted) that protocols of our genre are impossible. My humble
knowledge is unfortuantely insufficient to study them in details so as
to resolve the apparent contradiction between our result and the
impossibility claims. Readers interested in probing the causes of that
contradiction may eventually desire to read a paper of H. Pagnia and
F. C. Gaertner of 1999 entitled "On the Impossibility of Fair Exchange
without a Trusted Third Party" which is however currently not online
accessible from the institution where the paper was originally
published. In that case I could send over a copy. (My address:

If the contract C is as such directly to be signed and Alice and Bob
are to sign it online, then it is naturally the case that both
signatures couldn't be done at the same moment and consequently the
unfairness occurs. What the virtual cryptography does is to split C
into two pieces X and Y to be signed. Alice initiates the signing
process through first signing only X, but promises to sign Y in case
Bob signs both X and Y. As long as Bob's action is not done, Alice has
not signed C. That's trivial. After Bob signs X and Y, Alice must sign
Y within a time period TP, for otherwise she would have broken her
promise. Thus either C never comes into being, or C becomes valid in
step 3 but there is no time point in the entire processing where one
party is commited to C while the other party has the freedom to commit
to C or not. Isn't this sufficient to consider the protocol to be fair?

commitment to C). This is clear also from the fact that, if Bob doesn't

freedom (from the purposes of desiring having fairness in the first
place) in my view, not a matter of "exact" simultaneity (which even in
hand signaturing, when both partner are sitting together, not
physically done at the very same instant and also follows the rule
that, if one partner signs then the other has no freedom in not to

There have been a number of comments in this thread after my last
post. I like to express my opinions in the following:
(a) The definition of unfairness I have in mind is: A valid contract
C is unfair in its signing processing, if there existed a certain finite
time interval in which one partner had already fully committed while the
other had yet the freedom to commit or not.
(b) Validity of digital signatures is an issue orthogonal to the present
one. In my protocol signing is involved at lots of places. It is
assumed that they are all properly done and hence can be checked by
anyone who wants to verify the contract.
(c) In step 1 Alice could, if she desires, expressly reserve her right
to cancel the proposal at anytime before getting Bob's acceptance in T.
(This could be useful e.g. for one selling a rare book which he has
only a single copy.)
(d) I surmise that, contrary to the impossibility claims, even
alternative fair contract signing protocols may be designed, though
I believe that my proposal should anyway be among those that can be
most simply argued to be correct or not.
(e) I like to take this opportunity to request the general readers of
our group to kindly take a few minutes of their free time to think of
reality-near hypothetical scenarios of transactions where a contract
C comes into being with my protocol but either Alice or Bob could
afterwards have the feeling that the protocol was unfair for her/him.
I should be extremely grateful for such informations, since they open
the door for me to attempt eventually feasible amendments and

of OP for that case that "the protocol begins again at step 1" but

(3) If Alice could somehow trick. i.e. manages to claim to see no

I am interested to know a bit more details of how the law deals with
receipt of electronic messages with respect to time and actual arrival

You scheme may work, though I personally doubt that it could work in
all conceivable cases in practice. I don't like to argue with you here.
On the other hand, the existence of your scheme doesn't constitute a

Sorry that I don't yet fully understand your point. Let me sketch
my scheme in a way that IMHO would be easier for you to exactly
pinpoint in order to provide your corresponding critiques, if any:
In step 1 Alice proposes a contract C (in terms of X and Y of visual
cryptography) but she signs "only" X which (alone) has no significance
in the sense of a commitment. (Note that X could be combined with a
different Y' to result in a C' that is different from C.) She promises
that "if" in future Bob fully commits in step 2 via signing X and Y
"then" she would (and is responsible to) sign Y in step 3, thus
completing the formality of the proposed contract C. Of course step 2
is under the control of Bob, since step 2 is to be done by him in case
he considers Alice's C is acceptable. If he chooses not to do that,
i.e. he deems C to be not acceptable, then the protocol fails to
complete. I don't care scenarios where the protocol fails due to this
reason or other akin causes. What I do care is a scenario where the
protocol succeeds, i.e. a valid contract C comes into being, but the
signing processing is unfair according to my definition of fairness.
I attempt/hope to convince everybody that such a valid contract C
can never come out from my protocol. (This is my goal, nothing more,
nor less.)

@_subject: [Cryptography] Proposal of a fair contract signing protocol 
[I hope that the following more carefully/clearly formulated revised
version of my OP should render the underlying idea of mine
understandable and more easily seen to be correct.]
Proposal of a fair contract signing protocol (without a trusted third
When a contract in digital from is to be signed online by Alice and
Bob, an issue concerning the fairness of the signing process crops up
as follows: If Alice first signs the document and sends it to Bob, it
means she has committed to something (e.g. ready to purchase an article
from Bob certain price), Bob can however, if he desires, to some
extent delay giving his digital signature and thus have a certain
finite time interval during which he has no corresponding commitment.
This is obviously unfair and hence to be avoided, if possible.
Noting that with visual cryptography a document can be separated into
two pieces such that they jointly can reproduce the original but
neither piece alone provides any information of the document, we
propose the following protocol which well fulfills the requirements of
fairness in the present context.
In the following the convention is that signed(A, U) denotes U
digitally signed by A and that A thereby commits to U and that nothing
else, e.g. simply a V in a message (which as a whole piece can be
signed by A) has the meaning of a commitment. All messages are to be
sent with signcryption, i.e. encrypted with reciever's public key and
signed by the sender with his/her private key, and with authentication
(integrity check). All messages are to be sent with request for
acknowledgement of receipt.
Step 1: Alice formulates a contract document C, assigns to it a unique
identifier, generates with visual cryptography a pair (X, Y), signs X
and sends a message containing signed(Alice, X) and Y and a promise
(a conditioned commitment) that she will sign Y in case Bob signs X and
Y, to Bob.
Step 2: Bob obtains C from (X, Y). If he can't accept C, he informs
Alice and the protocol begins again at step 1. Otherwise he signs X and
Y and sends a message containing signed(Bob, X) and signed(Bob, Y) to
Step 3: Alice examines whether Bob has signed the correct stuff, e.g.
whether he had e.g. by mistake sent signed(Bob, Z) in place of
signed(Bob, X) with Z != X. If Bob had signed the wrong stuff, she
informs Bob and the protocol begins again at step 1. Otherwise she
signs Y and releases C, signed(Alice, X), signed(Alice, Y),
signed(Bob, X) and signed(Bob, Y) to the public.
Note that:
(a) In step 1 Alice has only signed X but not Y, thus has not yet
committed to C.
(b) In step 3 Alice is bound to sign Y because of her earlier promise
to do that in the message sent and signed by her to Bob in step 1.
(c) Our definition is: A valid contract C , i.e. one signed by both
partners, is unfair in its signing processing, if there existed a
certain finite time interval in which one partner had already committed
to C while the other partner had yet the freedom to commit to C or not.
It is evident that, when our protocol completes, fairness, thus
defined, is fulfilled.
(d) Our protocol doesn't involve/need any trusted third party, which is
an advantage.
(e) There are literatures which claim (if I have not misinterpreted)
that protocols of our genre are impossible. My humble knowledge is
unfortuantely insufficient to study them in details so as to resolve
the apparent contradiction between our result and the impossibility
claims. I guess that this could be a consequence of these literatures'
employment of a different (maybe more demanding) definition of fairness
than ours or there could eventually be errors in them. Readers
interested in probing the causes of that contradiction may eventually
desire to read a paper of H. Pagnia and F. C. Gaertner of 1999 entitled
"On the Impossibility of Fair Exchange without a Trusted Third Party"
which is however currently not online accessible from the institution
where the paper was originally published. In that case I could send
over a copy. (My address: mok-kong.shen at t-online.de)

Given 2 alphabetical sequences A and B of the same length. If A

suppose A has entropy u. Sort A to result in C such that all a's

are not affected by the sorting, C has also entropy u according to
Shannon's formula. However C is evidently less random than A. How
could one resolve this prolem? One could eventually employ pairs
of characters as unit and compute a similar measure with the
formula. But evidently the probllem would at best be weakened but
not basically resolved that way.

think a necessary condition of achieving sender anonymity is to employ
a neutral IP address, i.e. that of an Internet cafe or callshop. Now
suppose there is a webpage operating similar to those of a number of
Internet discussion communities where participants, after a free
registration procedure, can access it from anywhere and login with
their passwords and post their messages to the communities but in the
present context the users are limited to a small number of somehow
secretly registered ones, namely activists of non-democratic countries
(whose registration to the service may be arranged e.g. by their
friends in the free world). Wouldn't that constitute a practically
secure possibility for the activists to anonymously communicate with
one another as well as with persons of the free world? Note that, in
distinction to the webpages of the Internet discussion communities,
posts need not be stored for a long time and they may be encrypted
materials instead of plaintext. The owner of the webpage could also
introduce arbitrary dummy threads with dummy stuffs such that it is
much more difficult for an outsider to discern which are the real

There could apparently only be 2 possible causes conceivable:
(1) Scientific: Almost certainly a probabilistic procedure (commonly
involving the Miller-Rabin Test) was employed instead of Maurer's
algorithm of provable prime generation. Hence with some, though
practically very minute (depending on the parameter t of the
Miller-Rabin Test), probability one could indeed have obtained a
composite instead of a prime number, (2) Human: Human errors of
diverse genre and manipulation (backdoor).
Anyway, it cannot be overemphasized that the software engineering
community in the large and the IT-security community in particular
shouldn't simply "passively" react to such events (i.e. taking the
viewpoint that the event is now bygone and everything is again ok such
that life could continue as usual) but instead "learn" from such events
and "actively" attempt to find ways to fundamentally and significantlly
reduce the risks of similar deplorable events occurring in the future.

A recent article of Bruce Schneier, "Cryptography is harder than it

cryptography as simple and public as possible." That "simple" and
"public" criterion is astonishingly violated IMHO nowadays by almost
all open-source IT-security software in common use, because they are
too big and/or not sufficiently documented so as to attract or enable
experts to voluntarily examine them.
I believe there is not much good chance that this state of affairs
would be ameliorated in some near future, say within a few decades. On
the other hand, IMHO at least for personal communications of the common
people, simple and secure end-to-end encryption is nowadays in fact not
difficult to achieve, one reason of which being that high processing
efficiency is in this special case unessential, so that the codes can
be fairly small and very clear in the programming logic and
consequently easily to be examined by experts and even knowledgeable
laymen and certified by national standardization bodies and/or
IT-professional associations of diverse countries of the world. If a
software could thus obtain a sufficiently large number of independent
certificates, it's trustworthiness would certainly be higher for the
common people to confidently employ it. This kind of end-to-end
encrpytion being self-sufficient for security, one could simply
entirely ignore what the other security protection software along the
path from senders to receivers "claim" to provide. Certainly this would
be merely a minute achievements in the whole scenario of IT-security
applications (part of which may indeed justify stringent requirements
on processing efficiency), but a badly needed and valuable achievement

parallel, in cryptanalysis one could study not only single letter

additionally the frequency distributions of digrams, which provides
correspondingly additional informations.

unicity-distance doesn't properly take into account whether the entropy

To make my argument clear: Compare the general case of poly-alphabetical

permutations of the alphabet) and the special case (namely Vigenere,
with a 26*26 matrix where the first column is the alphabet as such and
each successive column is a rotation by one place of the preceeding

exactly the same. But also evident is the fact that the general

managed with my humble poor knowledge to capture (or conjecture) from
it is the following: It could provide certain security enhancements
over RSA but has corresponding trade-offs: (1) while for RSA with
modulus n the message space is [0, 2**n-1], the message space of the
scheme with the same n is smaller (being the size of the subgroup M in
the paper, i.e. for the same message space size one needs to use a
larger modulus), (2) The processing is more complex. (Both are not
surprising in view of the Principle of No Free Lunch.)

The following is taken from its abstract:
There are already many risks recognizably associated with the IoT. Some risks are old and well known, but exacerbated by the unprecedented scale of the IoT; estimates for the next few years suggest tens of billions of Things. Other risks may be new, stemming from the nature of how these Things are designed, what they are used for, how they are deployed and managed (or not managed), and how market forces will influence the development. In this column, we outline some of those risks and what might need to happen if the IoT is to deliver the benefits envisioned for it—with a reasonable level of trustworthiness. Our message is intended as a wake-up call for computer professionals, but is also relevant to everyone involved as a user.

Shannon did some experiments to determine the entropy in English texts. A later

implies that, if the letters are coded into 5 bits, one needs to combine 4 text files in order to obtain bit sequences of full entropy, since
4*1.34 = 5.36 > 5. The method used in our software is to sum (mod 32) the coded

There are plenty of other schemes for obtaining high quality pseudo-random

telephone numbers of my friends into its contact address list and informed my friends of my new mobile
phone number. Soon, though at a rather low frequency averaging roughly one event per day, a number of my
friends complained that I had called them but strangely never attempted to say even a single word. It
turned out that the device each time arbitrarily selected an entry in the contact address list and called
automatically, which could also be verified by its list of all outgoing calls. As remedy I deleted all
telephone numbers of my friends in it, leaving however for experimental purpose my own home telephone
number. One following night I had then the uncommon experience of being awoken by a call from my own
mobile phone! (Actually two new mobile phones of the same brand were tested. Following my complains of
the said phenomenon, the vender gave me a new examplar in exchange, so that the probability of there being
a manufacturing problem is vanishingly small.)
Another phenomenon that co-occurs with the above is that the device powers off automatically at a
frequency comparable to the first, even though its battery is sufficiently loaded.
Being a layman in such issues, I should be very grateful for exact explanations of the phenomena.

As the line quoting me says, it is merely my conjecture that software could be a likely cause. In matters yet not definitely known, persons with different
psychology, past life experience, actual personal situations, knowlege, etc. etc. could
very naturally have widely different conjectures. Even  in math, mathematians may
have different opinoins concerning whether certain long-time unresolved are indeed true and scientific, really objective, debates between those with one opinion
and those with the other are by nature impossible. So I have unfortunately to say
that I can't write any sensible sentences to counter what you wrote, while on the other
hand I tend to remain with my own conjecture.
The issue is of course outside the domain  of theories of cryptography. It's one of IT
security which I personally deem to encompass cryptography. Since I guess that
a part of participants of our community are also experts in IT security, I took the

One has the option of storing the contact list either on the SIM card or on the device.
Storing on the SIM card has the advantage that, if one migrates to a new device, there
is no need of building up a new contact list.
But actually whether the manipulation is done on the SIM card or done on the device itself is not essential. Essential in the present context is IMHO the fact
that there is a standing connection between the SIM card provider and the device
(necessary at least for accounting purposes) which I guess could be attacked by a
capable hacker.
Sorry, I don't understand your logic. If the malice could even deactivate the SIM card
as such, why couldn't he (in my view) just as simply manage do the things I described?
After all, deactivating the SIM card means that the device will be no longer be operational,
which wouldn't be a very favorable goal of the hacker.

I presume "writers" subsumes me in the present context. So I'll answer the question.
My divice worked correctly in that it called the number of an entry of its choice in the
contact list and accordingly registered the call in the list of dialed calls, which I could
check with my acquaintance who complained of my extraordinary call.

Here our thoughts are different. If someone  X is only malice and does something absolutely
without benefit for him to Y and from the number of people of the world randomly chooses
Y  to attack and in a way that technically could be presumed to possibly require fairly sophisticated

a new device, our personal estimates of the probabilities of the chance of coincidence involved in
such an event are apparently widely different from each other.
However, I deem it futile and not appropriate that we debate on our differences of minds in our
group. As I wrote earlier, I don't like to conjecture/speculate on the motivations of the hypothetical
attack, i.e. whether due to pure malice or maybe with other intentions, but I am on the other hand

In my OP I remarked that the vendor gave me a new device in exchange but phenomenon remained.
I hope that possibly someone could easily give me a good plausible explanation based
on what I described, noting that the phenomenon seems to be quite well-known, if
I don't err, since googling with e.g. "mobile phones making calls by itself" results in
fairly sizable numbers of similar cases.
It is my suspicion  that hacking could be a very probable cause. As layman I have had
namely the experience (three times!) of my PCs being hacked. But the very quick
occurrence of hacking on mobile phones (almost with the purchase of a new device
and a new SIM card) very much surprised me.
BTW, in the meantime I think I have found a good literature that seems to indicate that the
communications over the cellular networks are indeed very highly vulnerable to intrusions
by hackers. In the section of electronics of a public library I saw by pure chance a paper:
R. Devi et al., Implementation of Intrusion Detection System using Adaptive Neuro-Fussy
System for 5G Wireless Communication Network, Int. J. Electronics and Vol. 74 (2017) pp.94-106. I don't have knowledge to understand the content of that paper.
However I believe that its title alone seems to solidly support my layman's view/conjecture
of the very high vulnerability of mobile phones with respect to hacking. Experts please
kindly correct me, in case I am wrong with this thought of mine.

Since even you as expert couldn't, I presume, prove stuffs in the math sense on that
theme, I must say that there are apparently differences in our thoughts and that It's
unfortunately futile IMHO in practice to detail our different views on the potentially
possible motivations of  the hypothetical hacker, who I think could range from persons
doing things just for fun (quite a number of hackers of the very first generation were
such, if I don't err) to ones on the payroles of nation-states.
It seems (I conjecture) that the scheme was simply arbitrarily (randomly)
selecting an entry for doing the call. I unfortunately don't have sufficient data
to help clarifying this issue, because I quickly thought of and applied a remedy
to that trouble: I deleted all occurrences of telephone numbers of my in the device.
It's (in my layman's terminogy) a non-smart mobile phone, i.e. of design of an earlier
generation, not capable of Internet access at all, if I don't gravely err. It has a hole
for headset but I have never employed it. (BTW, you might be surprised that Bluetooth
is "almost" a foreign word for me.)
Its from SWISS+ONE,  SC330. The phone (also the 2nd one) was in original There is no possibility for me to install any Apps on it. (It's different from a smartphone.)
I don't know what you meant with "memory card" (I inserted a SIM card into it for it
to work, there isn't any other card I can see.) I use the same SIM card for the second
(exchanged) device as on the first device. Concerning updates over the wireless network,
my layman's conjecture (please tell me if I am wrong) is that's "definitely possible". For
I have a pre-paid tariff and  hence I believe the service provider must have a standing
possibility of connection with the device at least for accounting purposes. That's why
I conjecture that there could be a point of vulerability on that path for a hypothetical
hacker to exploit.
I regret that on the one hand I am (because of curiosity etc. etc.) interested to know
what/how actually happens in connection with the phenomenon but on the other
hand I am not ready to invest non-trivial time and money of mine into an Allow me to explain a bit on this. I had previously an old device of another brand
that the person at a repair shop thought its SIM card was possibly defective though
he didn't know the exact cause (It's not worthwhile for him to further and said it's advisable to simply buy a new device. To save money, I decided to buy
an old-fashioned one and not a smartphone. I paid less than 30 Euro for my
current device. It should be clear how much I would like to invest for a investigation of the issue. Since now that it is impossible for the device to call my
friends automatically, there being no such numbers for it to call, the device actually
works well for me, though rather inconveniently, as I have often to look up before
calling the telephone numbers of my friends in a list on a piece of paper in my purse.
