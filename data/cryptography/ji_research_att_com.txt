Well, there is a simple solution to it: offer to pay for their
development and maintenance costs, in exchange for a share in the
profits.  If you don't think there will be any (profits, that is), why
should they continue supporting it?

@_subject: Thai Pirates Crack Microsoft's New Windows System 
It's the so-called "Corporate Edition" and it exists in "professional"
(i.e., desktop) and various "server" forms.
I wonder if the Thai guys are just redistributing it with a key they stole from some company (in which case it's easily traceable back to
the origin of the leak), if they cracked the testing code and are creating their own keys, or if they simply patched the binary to
always return true no matter what activation key is given.
I also wonder how the cracked version will interact with the Windows Update
feature.  M$ claims that Windows Update does not transmit any information
about the computer that's being updated to microsoft, but I don't trust them.
Has anyone actually analyzed the WU scripts to see what exactly they
are sending, and whether they have any covert channels to send information

@_subject: My HP printer talking to the FBI? 
I haven't used ipfw in a while; I assume this means that the source of
the packet was the 12 address and the destination was your printer,
and it came from outside your firewall, right?
If this is the case, there is a much simpler explanation: someone is
attacking the web server at 12.1.224.109 using fake IP addresses; the
server is responding to the source address of the packet, and you
catch it.

@_subject: New encryption technology closes WLAN security loopholes 
Given the number of people with laptops who bring them in and out of
your average firewalled network, nothing can be considered secure.  Or
people spreading viruses, for that matter.
[Moderator's Note: To expand on John's point, many organizations were
infected with Code Red by people plugging their laptops in to the
corporate LAN after running them outside the LAN, or were infected via
VPN tunnels from machines on the outside that were incorrectly not
thought of as being part of the security perimeter. In the face of
such attacks, firewalls can no longer stop worms or viruses from
entering a firm. --Perry]

In increasingly many environments, the term "perimeter" makes little sense.
See, for example, the CCS-2000 paper on Distributed Firewalls by Sotiris
Ioannidis et al.  You can get it (among other places) from
(for the curious, the Ioannidis on that paper is my brother, not I).

@_subject: Fingerprints (was: Re: biometrics) 
Last week I had to go to my local INS office to get fingerprinted
(part of the green card process is getting your fingerprints OK'ed by
the FBI (and also presumably stored for future reference)).  The
process is computerised, with a low-res scan of all the fingers taken
once, and then each finger is individually rolled and scanned on a
much higher resolution scanner.  The process took about 20-30 minutes;  each finger had to be wiped
with some cleaning fluid, the glass on top of the scanner also had to
be wiped between scans, and a fingerprinting technician had to roll
each of my fingers with the right amount of pressure to get a clear
image of the fingerprint.  Even with immediate feedback on a large
screen showing the fingerprint and how good the scan was, some fingers
took as many as five tries to get an acceptable fingerprint.
Now, this was a special-built device whose only purpose is to scan
fingerprints, operated under ideal conditions by a trained
technician.  Draw your own conclusions about the effectiveness of
mass-produced fingerprint scanners that would be integrated in other

What's wrong with your backups? :-)
This is like a problem Windows already has: if you move a disk onto
different hardware, more often than not you can't boot because the
wrong Hardware Adaptation Layer info is in the disk's boot sector.  At
least you can recover the data by mounting it as a second disk.

@_subject: DOJ proposes US data-rentention law. 
Under this proposed law, will ISPs have to scan *all* SMTP traffic and
record the envelope, or only the traffic for which they actually do SMTP forwarding?  If the latter is the case, we can simply go back to
the original end-to-end SMTP delivery model; no POP/IMAP or any of
that stuff.  If the former is the case, well, so long as they don't
outlaw crypto, ISPs can't sniff SMTP going over IPsec, now, can they?
Of course, outlawing crypto or declaring that anyone who terminates an
SMTP connection, including end-users, is considered an ISP for the
purposes of the law solves their problem.

Why is this even newsworthy?  It's the NSA's responsibility to provide
sigint and comint.  Furthermore, if the delegates are not US citizens,
and at least one end of the communication is outside the US, they are
not even breaking any laws in doing so.
If the delegations can't be bothered to protect their own
communications, it's their tough luck if they get intercepted.
PS: I assume the "friendly foreign intelligence agency" is GCHQ?

@_subject: Delta CAPPS-2 watch: decrypt boarding passes! 
Are you referring to the "SSSS" string on the boarding pass?  That
indicated that you were going to be searched by the boarding gate TSA
people whether they were going to decide to search you or not (they
still picked up "random" people without the search string on their
boarding passess).
Both JFK and SFO have stopped gate searches.  Searches at security are
still decided by the TSA personnel there (they don't get to see your
boarding pass).
LHR still has gate searches, and the mix of people they were searching
looked fairly random.  I don't know if any of them had been flagged by
the computers, or if the gate security personnel had picked them out.
I wasn't searched, either going through security or at the gate, but
when I tried going from the gate area back into the duty-free area
they were pretty thorough (but exceedingly polite).

@_subject: The War on David Nelson 
I tried flying from LGA to BOS in January of 2002 on the Delta
Shuttle.  I happened to have forgotten my passport at home, and had no
driver's license at the time.  Despite long arguments going all the
way up to the head of their security (a certain Mr Colon), and showing
several credit cards, my employee and faculty IDs, and so on, I was
not allowed to board.  They wouldn't even refund my ticket.  My solution was never to fly with them again, even if it meant paying
more and taking extra stops to fly with another airline where Delta
would fly nonstop.
