Well, I suppose you could always check Bert-Jaap Koops' crypto law
survery (
However, there are only two countries, to the best of my knowledge,
that outright ban cryptography: Russia and China. And even that's only
a de-facto ban since both only require individuals to obtain a license
to use cryptography in any way, shape or form. From what I have heard,
it's nearly impossible for your average Joe to actually be issued such
a license. (Your average Joe in those countries is most likely more
concerned with putting food on the table anyhow but that's besides the
Israel has a license requirement as well. But since personal use is
exempt and the law allows for general licensing of software products,
it's pretty much a non-issue these days.

I think this has a lot to do with the fact that Germany and the US have
different standards of liability. The legal drinking age in Germany is
16 for beer and wine and 18 for distilled alcoholic beverages. A minor
under the age of 16 may consume alcohol with parental consent, as long
as that parent or a legal guardian is present. A violation is a mere
misdemeanor and may result in a fine but, in reality, hardly ever does.
The consequences of selling alcohol to a person who is not of legal age
are far more severe in the US. Aside from losing your liquor license
(and hence very likely your main source of income), you can expect
both, criminal prosecution and a civil suit, in most places. That's why
establishments in the US err on the side of caution and card their
customers. Most bars, liquor stores and gas stations even have zero
tolerance policies. It's not unusual for a twenty-something year old to
be carded for a pack of cigarettes or a single beer can.  People would
never put up with something like that in Germany.
Another factor is that the German ID card is mainly used by government
agencies. There are severe restrictions for non-government uses.
Private businesses may, for instance, not use the unique ID numbers as
identifiers or store them in a database. That makes them pretty much
useless for most non-official purposes. In the US, businesses are
pretty much free to request your SSN whenever they please.
They actually have to verify your identity. There is a ruling from
RegTP, which is a governing body in many ways similar to the FCC, that
stipulates that carriers have to retain the complete name, date and
place of birth and current address of anyone who buys a GSM SIM card.
Failure to do so usually results in hefty fines. That's why the
carriers make sure that the ruling is actually enforced.
On a slightly unrelated note: contrary to popular belief, there is no
German law that requires you to have your ID card or passport on your
person. You are required to give your name and date of birth to a law
enforcement officer or authorized agent of the state - but only upon
request. They may even take you into custody until they can positively
verify your identity but you do have to carry ID.
That's indeed quite likely. The original purpose of the RegTP's ruling
was to discourage theft though. There usually is little to no
resistance to giving up your personal data to the government in
Germany. In fact, there's federal law that requires anyone residing in
the country to keep their current address on file with their county's
record office. And this seems perfectly normal to most Germans. If
Congress tried to pass a law that required US citizens to register
their current address with the federal government, people would scream
bloody murder (despite the fact that it would be easy to get anyone's
address from the IRS, individual state's DMV databases or Google, for
that matter).
A terrorist, however, would have no reason to register their real
address or to show a real ID card when purchasing a cell phone. After
all, there are plenty of easier options available (theft, eBay, fake
ID, using public pay phones, etc).
Exactly the same applies to driver's licenses. A terrorist could just
fake one or use fake documents to obtain a real one. I think it's safe
to assume that if high school graduates have the means to obtain a
decent fake ID, terrorists do as well. The only way to tell if a
driver's license is real or not is by checking if the data on it
matches what's in the DMV's database. And that doesn't help if a
terrorist just decides to fake a birth certificate and marriage
license. I would be surprised if your average county clerk or DMV
worker actually managed to check if a document that's maybe fourty
years old is in fact the real deal.

[decline in credit card fraud]
I totally agree. And I would just like to make a quick point: the
credit card companies (especially Visa/Mastercard) have been very
agressive in fraud prevention in the last ten years. And I don't mean algorithms that detect unusual activity and flag a
card, thereby prompting your bank to call and verify that that the
charges are good. They've been doing that for years, if not decades.
No, I mean literally detective work -- tracking people down, having
their sites closed and bank accounts freezed and actually pushing to
have people prosecuted. They have been quite active, trying to recruite
people in the law enforcement community and offering handsome salaries.
The whole thing works based on the premise that there are a lot of
small-time gangsters at any given time but only a few big fish. And if
you can increase the cost of doing business (either in terms of making
credit fraud more expensive or in terms of increasing the likelihood to
get caught) you can basically justify the expense of running a big
anti-fraud unit.
But, in a way, that's only dealing with the symptoms, whilst at the
same time ignoring the root cause of the problem. You're only making it
less attractive to commit credit card fraud. You are, however, not
making it harder. That's why I believe the credit cards companies will
indeed have a good, long look at smartcards. Probably not tomorrow or
next week but in the near future.   -J?rn

@_subject: ID "theft" -- so what? 
See, that's precisely where the problems lies: I could not agree more
with you but the fact that you are completely, 100% right doesn't help
me one bit if T-Mobile's computer system requires that I give them my
SSN (which, by the way, may no longer be the case). And there's no point in arguing with the store manager because he
likely doesn't have the power to do anything about it anyway and
probably just doesn't care.
The fact of the matter is that you're making entirely too much sense.
SSNs were never intended to be used for authorization. That's why it
explicitly said "For Social Security Purposes. Not for Identification"
on the bottom of old social security cards. These days, federal law says quite the opposite. USC 405 [C] and
subsequent sections state that it's okay for any state or government
agency to require an individual to provider their SSN  "[...] for the
purpose of establishing the identification of individuals affected by
such law [...]". In the Greate State of California, you can, for
instance, not even get a driver's license without telling the DMV your
SSN. Since I don't see a connection between said (semi-)randomly
assigned number and my ability to operate a motor vehicle, I'd have to
wager a guess and say that the CA DMV does indeed use social security
numbers for identification purposes. Fortunately, they don't just go
ahead and use your SSN as your driver's license number, too (IL, I
believe, used to do that). And the fact that many private businesses and schools still use SSNs as
unique identifiers and often display them quite prominently for the
world to see (eg. to people working in call centers half-way around the
world) makes matters even worse. Because you will often find that people treat you like you're going out
of your way to be a PITA if you refuse to give them your SSN. And
that's all fine and well as long as we're talking about the likes of
T-Mobile. Just use a different carrier, right? Well, they all (used to)
require that you give them your SNN. And so do most telcos, utility
companies, landlords, banks, public schools, community colleges, DMVs,
credit card companies, car dealerships (financing, etc.), cable
companies and pretty much any government agency (state and federal)
that issues any kind of license.
The answer to this dilemma? I'm afraid this time it really is
legislation. Frankly, I'm not even sure if that would work but, at this
time, it's our best shot. Congress won't do anything about this unless
a few representatives have their identities stolen and experience
first-hand what a PITA it is to have to deal with the fallout.

@_subject: mother's maiden names... 
My local bank asked me apply for a Visa photo credit card back in 1998.
There were two problems though:
1.) Their request really was just that, a request. They told me that I
was free to get a regular card if I was in any way uncomfortable with
the photo card. In retrospect, it seemed more like a "we'd appreciate
it if you could do us a big favor" thing, and not so much like "look,
we're doing this for your own protection". The manager I talked to about this also informed me that they were only
asking customers with "high credit lines" (whatever that's supposed to
mean) to get credit cards with pictures since they were more expensive
(apparently, the bank had to eat the majority of the cost; I recall
only paying a $5 one-time fee).
2.) Secondly, checkout clerks just don't care. Well, they actually did
notice the picture on the back of the credit card and asked what it was
about maybe 6 out of 10 times. In most cases, the question resulted in
very pleasant but pointless chit-chat. Noone ever asked me why I didn't
look like the guy in the picture (I had since grown a beard and the
picture was really grainy and low-quality). Noone ever called a manager
to verify my identity despite the fact that it clearly said "Please
verify cardholder's picture." on the back. (I still have one photo
credit card and it no longer says that and has a more up-to-date
The problem here was that most check out clerks these days are
teenagers making minimum wage. They care about getting paid, not
getting robbed and not getting hassled. And, frankly, I can understand
that attitude because I felt the same way when I was in high school. Having too little cash in the register at the end of the shift stands
out and is likely to get a cashier in trouble. Having a credit card
purchase flagged as fraudulant a week after the fact doesn't cause as
much trouble. That's why there's no incentive to check CCs. It's also
why the Zug.com credit card prank worked so well back in the day.
My gym(!) has quite a different policy - they take a picture of every
member when apply. You may bring a guest but the member has to be
authenticated first and the guest has to sign in. If you forget your
RFID card, they just check the database (or, most likely, they will
recognize you). Any employee who lets people in withot an ID check or
without signing in, gets a warning. Employees get fired after three
warnings. Draconian? Yes. But it does work. And it wouldn't be too hard
for the credit card companies to print "MUST VERIFY ID" onto the back
of new credit cards.
These days, I am on a first name basis with most of the cashiers at the
local grocery stores (which is due to the fact that I'm friends with
their parents who pretty much all live in the same neighborhood as we
do - suburbia and all). But I do remember when we moved here and back
then cashiers really noticed the credit card I had written "PLEASE ASK
FOR ID. THANK YOU." onto. At that time, it was mostly a social
experiment. And, frankly, it didn't work. They noticed (as in "huh,
that's weird") but they never bothered to ask me for ID (as "huh,
that's weird, may I see your ID please, Sir?").

@_subject: massive data theft at MasterCard processor 
That most certainly is true but you're overlooking a
more practical aspect. All German financial
institutions that processes credit card transactions
contractually require their merchants to offer the
customer a receipt (as does German law in most cases). Most, if not all, banks that issue credit cards require their customers
to retain a copy of those receipts for one billing cycle (ie. until
they send you your statement and you have a chance to
review it and compare individual charges that seem
suspect with the data on the receipts you have).
If your receipt says $6.99 but your statement says
$10,000 (classic MITM attack), you have a valid
defense in the eyes of the German law. Legally, the
receipt is the document which authorized the financial
transaction. If you show up in court and present your
$6.99 receipt, you automatically shift the burden of
proof to the bank -- now they have to positively proof
that you indeed authorized $10k, and not just $6.99,
not be transfered. Realistically, the will hardly ever
be able to do that.
That model works fairly well. The weak point is the
customer -- just tossing or blindly signing a receipt
obviously breaks the model. But, personally, I don't
really have a problem with that; the point is to
protect the customer from scammers, and not from his
or her own stupidity.

You can already do the latter with SwitchProxy
( Basically, it's a
Firefox extension that saves you the trouble of going into the
'preferences' dialogue everytime you want to switch from one proxy to
another (or go from using a proxy to not using one, that is).
It works like a charm with tor and a local proxy. It also has a "Anonymizer mode", which cycles through a list of proxies
in an attempt to give you some kind of pseudo-anonymity (which I guess
is good enough for many people).
