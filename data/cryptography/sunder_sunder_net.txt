You can only do this if you can trust the hardware.  As long as any
potential untrustworthy folks have access to that hardware, it cannot be
It is possible to do the rest of this if you manage to secure the machines
from any other kinds of access by disabling all services other than that
particular p2p (to prevent remote access overflows from insecure
applications).   If you see the network problem as a multi-ended VPN,
that's the next part.
But I do not see any way for any member of the network to certify that any
other node is running exactly the same software, unless all nodes restrict
access to the hardware and have an external certification process.  If
anyone anywhere can grab the software - binary or source and join the
network while still having hardware access, all bets are off.  The only thing the other nodes can certify is that the crypto signatures
are right, and that the protocol is the same.  But even if you sign the
binaries, you don't know that the thing at the other end has the signature
it just sent you.
You can try to make things complex such as pushing binaries to the other
node and having them run there, but you don't know if you're inside a
VMware box, or Bochs emulator, or a real machine.
Even if you can certify that the application does what you think it does,
you can't ceritfy that the operating system or the hardware isn't going to
do anything else.
End of story.  Can't be done so long as anyone other than you has root on
the machine, or has physical access.  Hence you need to buttplug the
hardware and make it difficult to modify.  Even so, you don't have any
idea of if that CPU really is what it says it is, or that the hardware
will do what you think it will do.  Hardware can be replaced or patched
with things that can look like the original, or things that at some
opportune moment interrupt and switch out that hardware, then get full
access to all the ram.
No, I couldn't afford such hardware mods.  But say someone that has enough
money to own a DVD pressing factory certainly can afford the R&D.  In the
end TCPA/Palladium will be broken.  Just the USG kept pushing single DES
until even a bit after the DES cracker got built.
I've no problem with that, nor the fact the RIAA/MPAA want to protect
their warez - if they get that oppresive, I won't be buying it, and I'm
positive that others won't either...  In the end, they'll just be burning
a lot of money and find out that they'll go broke.  Ironic? Yup.  As long
as it's a free market, they'll fry for pissing off their consumers.
I do have a problem with having spyware forced down my machines by John
Law.  Intel wants to put Pd compliant chips in their mobo's, fine, I won't
buy their hardware -- or if I do, I'll be sure to reflash the BIOS to a
slightly different enough version without signatures to force the Pd chip
to shut down... If it won't let me, their loss.  There's still AMD.  AMD
joins intel?  Fuck x86, there's still Sun, and Apple.  The only way that Pd will be successful is if every hardware manufacturer
is forced by law to include it.  And I've no problem with MSFT making
their software oppresive, they're just digging their own graves, I'll
applaud as they sink in to the bog.  Fuck'em.  They're extinct.
Long as the motherboard will let me boot whatever OS I want, long as
Kongress keeps their paws out of my machine and doesn't extract a tax to
pay the losers for their "losses", MSFT, Intel, MPAA, RIAA can do whatever
they want.
And no, I don't believe that making an open source, hardware free version
of what they're trying to do will prevent Jackoff Vallenti from pushing
dollars to kongress to close the PeeCee hole while sucking Bill Gates's
balls simultaneously.
In the end, the only guarantee you have is that the thing at the end is
talking the same language as you and that anyone else can't snoop the
traffic and see what's there - so long as your crypto-fu is good, and the
security on both machines is decent enough to prevent them from being
owned.  So why bother?
Just because the evil empire is running at full speed towards the
precipice doesn't mean we need open source versions of the same insanity
that drives'em.

The worst trouble I've had with https is that you have no way to use host
header names to differentiate between sites that require different SSL
i.e.    can't all live on the same IP and
have individual ssl certs for https. :(  This is because the cert is
exchanged before the http 1.1 layer can say "I want  So you need to waste IP's for this.  Since the browser standards are
already in place, it's unlikely to be to find a workaround.  i.e. be able
to switch to a different virtual host after you've established the ssl
session.  :(
Personally I find thawte certs to be much cheaper than verisign and they
work just as well.
In any case, anyone is free to do the same thing AlterNIC did - become
your own free CA.  You'll just have to convince everyone else to add your
CA's cert into their browser.  You might be able to get the Mozilla guys
to do this, good luck with the beast of Redmond though.
Either way, having a pop-up isn't that big deal so long as you're sure of
the site you're connecting to.
In either case, we wouldn't need to worry about paying Verisign or anyone
else if we had properly secured DNS.  Then you could trust those pop-up
self-signed SSL cert warnings.

@_subject: Software protection scheme may boost new game sales 
Yawn...  This is no different than any of the copy protection schemes
employed in the 1980's on then popular home computers such as the
commodore 64.  Hindsight is 20/20 and recalls, all of these were broken within weeks if
not months.  "Nibbler" copiers and other programs were quickly built that
allowed the breaking of all of these systems.  All sorts of "error"
sectors, duplicate tracks, half tracks, extra tracks, extra sectors,
non-standard sized sectors, tracks written at different speeds, erroneous
checksums, hidden data, and other sorts of weird bits were employed.  All
were broken.  None survived the ages.
In the end, the companies that employed copy protection only managed to
piss off customers who lost their only copy of the software, and created a
market for the copiers and crackers.  The crackers won, the software
companies lost.  Few of the companies of that era are still in business today.  CEO's,
Vulture Capitalists, and others who have an interest in such schemes would
do well to invest some time in learning about that time, and the results,
for their investments, and dollars will go the same way... the way of the
brontosaurus, the trilobite, and the dodo.
Let them try, if they wish to burn their money.  As far as I'm concerned,
I'll vote with my wallet as usual and only run open source, free software.  If the moronic kids at whom these titles are aimed have the $50-$70 per
title to waste on self destructing, flavor of the month games, they are
certainly free to spend that money to their heart's desire.
Not a dime from my wallet will wind up in their pockets - except perhaps
indirectly:  the next time I buy my next burger, "no, I don't want fries
with that, no, I don't want to supersize it," my $5 eventually makes a
small contribution to the salary of the burger flipper, which in turn is
applied to the purchase of said game.  :)
I've not read the said article just yet, but from that direct quote "as
the copy degrades..." I can already see the trouble with this scheme:
their copy protection already fails them.  They allow copies to be made
and rely on the fact that the CDR or whatever media, will eventually
degrade, because their "code looks like scratches..."  Riiiiggghtt.....
If you can make one copy, you can make many, and you can certainly store
the ISO in compressed form on a normal CD to make more copies
later.   CDR's are what? $0.20@ these days?
Hell, you can even get one of those virtual CDROM programs to mount the
CD's as if they were CD's, and store the ISO on a hard drive, or DVD-R
instead. Hard drives are already in the 250-500GB range these days.  So
their scheme is already flawed and doomed from the start.
It seems to me that people that engage in treating their customers like
theives to begin with lack a vital ingredient for making money: common

API you can use to get at the error correction info somewhere -- or you
can use timing info... i.e. ask for a bad sector, and see how long it
takes to return the sector vs one that's supposed to be good...  You can't stray too far from published API's, since if you do, you'll
potentially break your game when future OS's, patches, service packs,
hotfixes, or devices come out...  I.E. if you don't support anything but
IDE CDROM's, will you fuck users that use SATA, scsi, FireWire, or USB
cdroms? etc...  What happens under Windblows 2005?  Does your business
model say that they can't play on future OS's/hardware?  You won't be in
business very long if you do that.
CDROM driver to the OS, and run the game.  It would act as a proxy to the
real CDROM, but also log any unusual activity (errors, odd timing,
etc...)  So then, the cracker can write a second virtual cdrom driver, one
that passes through the usual data off the CDR copy, but for those
"unusual" sectors that it captured earlier, replay the action.
Might even want to do this with two machines so you lessen the chance that
the game will find the original CD and ignore the virtual. :)
Of course the game could somehow figure out if a CD is virtual - by
getting driver information?  But if you're sneaky enough you can make your
virtual CDROM driver look like a second IDE controller, etc.. (see above
about SATA, USB, etc...)
Doing a search on google for "virtual cdrom" I see quite a few such
beasts...  It's possible one of these even has source code, but I don't
much care to bother searching further as I've no interested in this except
from the theoretical. :)
(In terms of things like Linux/*BSD you don't need no stinkin' driver, you
can directly mount an ISO file, but you could very easily write a block
device driver that added the errors/delays or whatever these things depend
That said, the scheme isn't without merit provided that it tells the luser
that he should purchase a real one.... maybe after it stops working pop up
an ad and say "Now that you've played your friend's copy, and saw the
demo, you can continue if you buy the full version..."
I seem to remember lots of old Macintosh software doing this.  You were
allowed and even encouraged to copy the floppy it came on and give it to
your friends.  When your friend installed the software, it would ask for
the serial  (which you weren't supposed to give out.)
At that point, it would go into demo mode and run for a week, or two, and
then refuse to run.  So if your friend wanted the cool program you
recommended, they'd buy their own copy.  I'm not sure how successful that
was, but I'm assuming it did quite well...
The difference between that and this, is that if you put the floppy on
your fridge door with a magnet, you could always get your backup (or ask
your friend for her copy.)  With this, even if you have a legally
purchased copy, one or two scratches and it's literraly "Game Over Man!"   + ^ + :25Kliters anthrax, 38K liters botulinum toxin, 500 tons of   /|\

@_subject: Johns Hopkins Physics Lab System Detects Digital Video  Tampering 
And what stops an attacker from taking that digital video, stripping off
the RSA(?) signatures (I'll assume it's just signed), editing it, creating
another, random, one time private key, "destroying" that private key after
resigning it, and offering it up as unedited?!?!?!?!
They've either obviously not relesed all the details about this method,
since you have no way to validate that the presented public key was
created by their camcorder.  So how would you prove that something came
from a particular camera?  Do you cripple the private key somehow to be
able to identify it?  Do you sign it twice? If you do, then a more
permanent private key lives in the camcorder and can be extracted to also
produce fake keys, etc...
Either that, or this gets a nice wonderful SNAKE OIL INSIDE sticker
slapped on it. :)
Even more obvious: What stops an attacker from taking the camcorder apart,
disconnecting the CCD output, then hooking up an unsigned edited video
signal to it, and recording as a signed video?
IMHO, it has an aroma rich with viperidae lipids.
