@_subject: [Cryptography] Proposal of a fair contract signing protocol 
Can we please stop this "who is on first?" thread?  The very definition of fairness provided by MK is recursive. End. After step 1 Alice is committed to C (via signing Y in step 3) "on
condition" that (i.e. IF) Bob commits to C in step 2, but she has not
(yet) committed to C. So at that time point it is not true that
"Alice is [already] committed [to C] where Bob isn't".
After step 2, Bob is committed to C and, since Alice is bound to commit
to C now owing to what she has done in step 1, step 3 occurs and the
protocol completes. The fairness definition only applies to a completed
protocol, i.e. after step 3 (in other words it is meaningless to
consider the definition without also taking what happens in step 3 into
