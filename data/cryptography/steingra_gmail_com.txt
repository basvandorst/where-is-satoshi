Not to be too contrary (though at least a little) - not all of these
are really PKI failures are they?
The malware could just as easily fake the whole UI.  Is it really
PKI's fault that it doesn't defend against malware?  Did even the
grandest supporters ever claim it could/did?
Similarly here - non-EV CAs bind DNS names to a field in a
certificate. No more.  They don't vouch for the business being run,
and in any case any such "audit" would be point in time anyway. I
suppose way back when people "promised" that certs would do this, but
does anyone believe that anymore and have it as an expectation?
Perhaps you're setting the bar a bit high?
BTW - do you have pointers to most of the things you've reported?  I'd
love to get the full sordid details :)

As of Jan-2014 CAs are forbidden from issuing/signing anything less than
2048 certs.  Lots of people are acting now to get ahead of that.
EV's have been required to be 2048 for quite some time.

This is why you're seeing Mozilla and Google implementing these checks for
compliance with the CABF Basic Requirements in  code....

Do you have a proposal for this?  How exactly a browser should defend
against any/all malicious software including software that doesn't exploit
a technical vulnerability but the user simply installs because they are
fooled into doing so?
AV?  Nope. Plenty of reasons that won't work.
Crowd-source the info on bad software - doesn't work against one-off
Force code signing - doesn't work well when the attackers steal the keys of
legit software.  This has happened a few times over the last 3 years.
Force installs only from "approved sources" - nope.  and you'll get killed
by the anti-paladium crowd about how you're taking their freedom away to
run whatever software they want to on their machine.
I'm open to suggestions but hand waving and "someone really ought to do
something" is pretty weak sauce -  Especially since this isn't what most
people would call phishing (the article got it wrong) and the original
point and the quote from Gates was about more traditional phishing that
steals users credentials rather than socially engineering users into
installing malware.
