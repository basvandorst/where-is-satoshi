See  for recent data re SSL certificate market share; Geotrust, at , has 11% of the market, and appears (from their web pages; I haven't bought one) to be ready to issue SSL server certs without the torturous document review process which Verisign invented but Thawte managed to make simultaneously more intrusive and less relevant.

For another data point, see this Netcraft survey circa January 2001 -
.. it shows approx 108,000 secure servers (they don't total it, and I didn't
bother adding up all the CA's with 10 certs in use.)
Security Space's numbers for the same timeframe show that they found 58,117
servers - .
I don't know if the difference means that, between Jan 2001 and Jun 2002,
Security Space has discovered the other 40,000 secure servers in use; or
if they always see a fraction of what Netcraft does. (Netcraft's current data
is available for a yearly subscription at 1200 UKP.)
What I find especially telling in the recent Security Space results is the breakdown by "validity" -
Valid: 17833
Self-signed: 5275
Unknown signer: 13348
Cert-host mismatch: 32536
Expired: 35071
.. so, less than 20% of the certificates that they find on SSL servers in use on the open Internet are functioning correctly as part of a PKI; even if we assume that every one of the self-signed and
unknown signer certs servers are participating in undocumented or private PKIs such that their details are
unavailable to surveys like this one, that's still only 40% of the visible SSL servers. The remaining 60% are apparently misconfigured or forgotten.

The CVE data is available at ;
a mechanical (e.g., string-based) search of the database for all reports
(2224 as of the data set from June 25, 2002) find 461 which mention the
string "buffer overflow" in their description.
For the 563 reports dated in 2001, 99 mentioned buffer overflows.
For the 88 reports published so far in 2002, 21 mentioned buffer overflows.
But - the CVE web pages specifically warn, "CVE is not designed like a vulnerability database, so searches for general terms like "Unix" or "buffer overflow" could give you incomplete or inaccurate results."

I haven't used the software myself; but according to the webpage you mention, the software encapsulates messages in executable files which are to be run by the recipient.
I believe that model is fatally flawed, for a number of reasons (not necessarily ranked in order of
severity) -
1.      Platform independence - what if the executable won't execute on your recipient's system? The marketing material at  says that it only runs on Windows systems. What if you want to correspond with someone who uses a Mac, or a Unix workstation, or runs a non-Windows OS on their PC hardware? Will the messages be readable in 10 years, even on a Windows system?
2.      Private key encryption - it appears to use only private key encryption ("The recipient requires no special software, because Crypt & Go packages decode themselves after the password is entered.") This means that you've got to pre-arrange & manage keys to use with your correspondents, with all of the attendant hassles.
3.      Execution of unsolicited, unknown programs - if the recipient doesn't have special software, how do they know that the executable they received (a) is really from you, and (b) is what it purports to be? What if it's email sent by a virus like Klez? An incoming might be from a third party who had the two of you in his address book when s/he was infected. It's wildly irresponsible and reckless to run executables received unsolicited via email, which is exactly what Crypt-and-Go depends on. (In light of Klez and other email-forging viruses, it should be abundantly clear that it's not good enough to rationalize "well, I recognize the name of the person in the From: header, so I guess this is safe".)
Sure, a reasonable response to (3) is to install a virus scanner, and/or special crypto software which will authenticate the message before running the executable .. but if you've done that, you've abandoned the "no special software" marketing feature, and might as well just mail text documents back & forth, since you've got an authentication scheme you trust.
They say they use 128-bit AES - which sounds fine, if it's implemented appropriately - but even assuming a bulletproof AES implementation, the other aspects of the package make it, in my opinion, a danger to its users, who would be better served sending emails in the clear or faxes.

Sun is promising not to sue people for patent infringement for using Sun's code as provided
in the OpenSSL library, provided that the people who don't want to be sued comply with
a list of conditions:
(1) they promise not to sue Sun for infringing any of their own patents which might
cover the use of the donated code
(2) don't modify Sun's code as provided by Sun, don't use only parts of the donated code,
and don't remove the license text from the code.
