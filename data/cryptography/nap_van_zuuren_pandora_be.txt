Storage AND RETRIEVAL of documents, key pairs, certificates, relating algorithms, software used etc.

Might be a nice (intellectual) crypto-exercise, but I am afraid that the concept of the Qualified Signature will not get a widespread implementation, expect for very specific areas/disciplines.

On the European "exercise", started by a Directive of the European Commission see:
On Common (Security) Criteria, see:

The high level summary is that phones contain a great deal of interesting
information, that they can target IPhone and Android phone, and that after
some pretty long efforts they can hack the Blackberry too. Bottom line, get
a Windows Phone...
