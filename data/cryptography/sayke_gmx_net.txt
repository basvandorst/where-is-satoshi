@_subject: Announcing httpsy://, a YURL scheme 
At 09:21 AM 7/15/2003 -0400, someone with the password to          i think the difference between sfs and yurl lies in the yurl scheme's use of pet names to make long hashes easier to remember. while this seems like a promising approach, the thought of typing in a new pet name every time i visit a new domain (or mount a new volume via nfs) looks like too high of a burden, interface-wise, on users in general.
         perhaps if i could occasionally download (and authenticate with a [pet_name, hash] pair) pre-digested lists of such pairs from opennic or the eff etc, i might feel more inclined to use the system... this opens the possibility of multiple coexisting global namespaces, and raises ye olde' "who do you trust" question...
         perhaps we might as well design things that use [global_name, ip_address, pubkey_fingerprint, pet_name] sets, and just get it over with =D
