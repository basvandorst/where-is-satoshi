Listening to CPUs with radios was common.  I haven't tried it in
years but I recall being surprised that when I had a TEMPEST-shielded
Sun workstation in the '90s, it could be heard on the radio.  I don't
recall much about what is sounded like.  With the PDP-6, I recall that
you could hear the different phases of a radix sort.

I think it will be sooner than that.  I see no legal protection
against having your mind read by force and I see the technology moving
that way very quickly.

The problem is with the term `end-to-end encryption.'  All
encryption is from one end of something to another.  Link encryption
is from one end of a link to the other.  Perhaps the term we need here
is ``user-to-user encryption.''

update their definitions of the term.)
    Phillip Hallam-Baker has pointed out a serious problem:
        I don't think user-to-user encryption is the term we need
because that is what a lot of the
        video conferencing systems have AES running from one user to
the other. But they don't
        have user to user security because the key exchange is
happening in a cloud service they
        control completely (people using ECB mode probably aren't
using threshold techniques).
Encryption can be end-to-end but for security to be end-to-end the key
negotiation has also to be end-to-end.  The terminology had fooled me
and I had not seen this clearly before.

    This is a different sort of objection and surprises me.  It is a
factual question; does somebody have the facts?

I love the source:

Mae Brussel was a woman who woke up on 23 November 1963 and realized that
the world was not as she had thought.  She began doing research and
reported that research in a weekly radio broadcast that ran from the early
seventies until slightly before her death.  Her disciple is Dave Emory who
continues the research and reporting in a weekly series called For the
