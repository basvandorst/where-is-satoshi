OK, I'm a mere country mouse when it comes to cryptography,
so be kind.
I have read most of the above paper on non-repudiation and
noticed on p3 the following footnote:
"Note that there is no theoretical reason that it should be
possible to figure out the public key given the private key,
either, but it so happens that it is generally possible to
do so"
So what's this "generally possible" business about?
A few references will do.
