Early Registration ends December 3.                          Call For Participation
         First IEEE International Security In Storage Workshop
            December 11th, 2002 -- Greenbelt, Maryland, USA
                                                 Co-Sponsored by                IEEE Task Force for Information Assurance
             IEEE Mass Storage Systems Technical Committee
The ability to create large shared storage systems in a secure manner
has received little formal research.  A comprehensive, systems approach
to storage security is required for success of storage consolidation. This workshop serves as an open forum to discuss storage threats,
technologies, methodologies and deployment.
The proceedings will be published by IEEE and will be available in print
and online. Attendees will receive a preprint of the proceedings at the
workshop as well as the formal proceedings mailed after the workshop.

@_subject: Windows 2000 declared secure 
I believe I have an interesting question... While I am not generally a
Microsoft fan, the documentation that was pointed to seems to be
inconsistent. I agree with most of what Johnathan says,and maybe this is
just a nit that is irrelevant to the discussion at hand.
The document that the email referenced is
 which in turn references page
9 of
which I will quote a few paragraphs below where Johnathon quoted:
        1.3 Strength of Environment
        The CAPP is for a generalized environment with a moderate level
        of risk to the assets. The assurance requirements and the
        minimum strength of function were chosen to be consistent with
        that level of risk. The assurance level is EAL 3 and the minimum
        strength of function is SOF-medium.
But the press release states NT-2000 achieved EAL-4?
between EAL3 and EAL4 are:
EAL3 - methodically tested and checked
        EAL3 permits a conscientious developer to gain maximum assurance
        from positive security engineering at the design stage without
        substantial alteration of existing sound development practices.
        It is applicable in those circumstances where developers or
        users require a moderate level of independently assured
        security, and require a thorough investigation of the TOE and
        its development without incurring substantial reengineering
        costs.
        An EAL3 evaluation provides an analysis supported by "grey box"
        testing, selective confirmation of the developer test results,
        and evidence of a developer search for obvious vulnerabilities.
        Development environmental controls and TOE configuration
        management are also required.
EAL4 - methodically designed, tested and reviewed
        EAL4 permits a developer to maximize assurance gained from
        positive security engineering based on good commercial
        development practices. Although rigorous, these practices do not
        require substantial specialist knowledge, skills, and other
        resources. EAL4 is the highest level at which it is likely to be
        economically feasible to retrofit to an existing product line.
        It is applicable in those circumstances where developers or
        users require a moderate to high level of independently assured
        security in conventional commodity TOEs, and are prepared to
        incur additional security-specific engineering costs.
        An EAL4 evaluation provides an analysis supported by the
        low-level design of the modules of the TOE, and a subset of the
        implementation. Testing is supported by an independent search
        for vulnerabilities. Development controls are supported by a
        life-cycle model, identification of tools, and automated
        configuration management.
[TOE stands for Target of Evaluation.] Is it arguable that the difference is minimal. Is there a more formal
description of what can be done with an EAL3 vs an EAL4 device?
