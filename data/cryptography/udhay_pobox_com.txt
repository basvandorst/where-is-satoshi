Peppercoin is a new approach to an old challenge: how to make small value transactions?micropayments?feasible. There is a whole world of digital content gathering dust because owners cannot find a profitable way to get it into the hands of paying customers.
Merchants can profitably sell content or services at very low price points, which would be unprofitable with traditional payment methods.
Consumers can purchase small-value items easily; PepperCoins are "digital pocket change" for music, games, and other downloads.
Through a cryptographically secure process of sampling digital payments, Peppercoin reduces the volume of transactions processed by a third-party payment processor or financial institution. Peppercoin utilizes the most robust and secure digital encryption technologies, based on RSA digital signatures, to process and protect payments.

Quantum cryptography takes to the skies

NewScientist.com news service
Quantum cryptography keys encoded in photons of light have been transmitted more than 23 kilometres through air, British researchers have announced. They say the breakthrough is an important step towards a global communications system that is completely secure.
Earlier in 2002 a Swiss company managed to send quantum keys over 60 kilometres. But this was through optical fibres, which limits the technology to ground-based transmission.
"Our experiment paves the way for the development of a secure global key-distribution network based on optical links to low-Earth-orbit satellites," says John Rarity, at QinetiQ, the public arm of the UK's defence research agency.
Rarity acknowledges that the 23 kilometres is still a long way short of the 1000 kilometres needed to reach all LEO satellites, but he believes that improvements in filtering out ambient light could make this feasible soon. "I think I will have a system design to do that by March 2003," he says.
Another obstacle to be overcome is to engineer signals that, unlike the visible light used, will not be absorbed by clouds.

My colleague Seth Schoen has finished his long-awaited, brilliant white-paper on Trusted Computing. Seth has been briefed as an outside technical analyst by all the companies working of Trusted Computing architecture, and has had his paper vetted by some of the leading security experts in the field. This is the most exhaustive, well-reasoned, balanced analysis of Trusted Computing you can read today. Don't miss it.
Remote attestation is the most significant and the most revolutionary of the four major feature groups described by Microsoft. Broadly, it aims to allow "unauthorized" changes to software to be detected. If an attacker has replaced one of your applications, or a part of your operating system with a maliciously altered version, you should be able to tell. Because the attestation is "remote", others with whom you interact should be able to tell, too. Thus, they can avoid sending sensitive data to a compromised system. If your computer should be broken into, other computers can refrain from sending private information to it, until it has been fixed. While remote attestation is obviously useful, the current TCG approach to attestation is flawed. TCG attestation conspicuously fails to distinguish between applications that protect computer owners against attack and applications that protect a computer against its owner. In effect, the computer's owner is sometimes treated as just another attacker or adversary who must be prevented from breaking in and altering the computer's software.

How Having Friends Might Be the Key to Both Privacy and Identity
By Robert X. Cringely
I've been thinking what passes at my house for deep thoughts about identity and privacy -- thoughts spurred both by my columns of the last several weeks and the reaction of readers to them. At one extreme, we have identity zealots who would plant microchips in our kids. At the other extreme, we have privacy zealots who don't want anyone anywhere to know anything about them or about what they do. Somewhere in the middle, we can probably place most of the rest of us. It is doubtful that we can fully satisfy both extremes at the same time, so the real question is what path will give us the most identity for the least loss of privacy or the most privacy with the least amount of identity?

     This is an interesting time for electronic voting. India,
     the largest democracy in the world, went completely paper-
     free for its general elections earlier this year. For the
     first time, some 387 million people expressed their
     electoral right electronically. Despite initial concerns
     about security and correctness of the system, the election
     process was a smashing success. Over a million electronic
     voting machines (EVMs) were deployed, 8000 metric tonnes of
     paper saved[1] and the results made public within few hours
     of the final vote. Given the quarrelsome and heavily
     litigated nature of Indian democracy, a lot of us were
     expecting post-election drama, but only a few, if any,
     fingers were found pointing.

Last WWII Comanche "code talker" dies in Oklahoma
By Ben Fenwick, Reuters
OKLAHOMA CITY, Oklahoma (Reuters) - The last surviving Comanche "code talker" from World War Two, Charles Chibitty, has died at a nursing home in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a tribal spokeswoman said Thursday.
Chibitty, who died Wednesday at age 83, was one of the 14 Comanche tribesmen who transmitted radio messages in their native language during the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944.
In a 2002 speech Chibitty said: "I wonder what the hell Hitler thought when he heard those strange voices over there, when we hit D-Day at Utah Beach. Now old Hitler, he's probably scratching his head yet down in his grave."
He said they called Nazi dictator Adolph Hitler "posah tai vo" which means "crazy white man."

@_subject: Ostiary 
Sounds interesting. Has anybody used this, and are there any comments?
Tools like ssh and lsh are great for allowing secure remote access to your system. They offer essentially full, flexible remote control of a machine, in an ecrypted and authenticated manner. But they are complex pieces of software; there's no way to do what they do without being complex. And with complexity comes bugs. Tools like ssh and lsh, and VPNs like CIPE, PPTP, and more have all had serious flaws that would allow an attacker to get full control over your system.
If you leave such programs running all the time, you take the risk that someone is going to use an exploit on you before you have a chance to apply a patch. For some purposes, this is an acceptable - even necessary - tradeoff, but it would be nice to enable them only when actually needed, to minimize the risk. And for other purposes, ssh et. al. are overkill. Perhaps you only really need to remotely initiate a limited set of operations. In this case, you don't need a shell prompt, just a way to securely kick off scripts from elsewhere.
Enter 'Ostiary'. It is designed to allow you to run a fixed set of commands remotely, without giving everyone else access to the same commands. It is designed to do exactly and only what is necessary for this, and no more. The only argument given to the command is the IP address of the client, and only if the authentication is successful. The following are the key design     * "First, do no harm." It should not be possible to use the Ostiary system itself to damage the host it's running on. In particular, it's willing to accept false negatives (denying access to legitimate users) in order to prevent false positives (allowing access to invalid users).
    * Insofar as possible, eliminate any possibility of bugs causing undesired operations. Buffer overflows, timing attacks, etc. should be impossible for an external attacker to execute. There's no point in installing security software if it makes you less secure.
    * Be extremely modest in memory and CPU requirements. I want to be able to fire off commands on my webserver (running on a Mac SE/30, a 16MHz 68030 machine) from my Palm Pilot (a 16MHz 68000 machine). Things like ssh already take 30 seconds or more to start up - I can't afford anything too     * Keep things simple. I'm no crypto expert; I know I'm not capable of coming up with an ssh replacement. So I need to keep things so utterly simple that I can be sure I'm not missing anything important.

Chinese Cryptologists Get Invitations to a U.S. Conference, but No Visas
By JOHN MARKOFF
Published: August 17, 2005
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 16 - Last year a Chinese mathematician, Xiaoyun Wang, shook up the insular world of code breakers by exposing a new vulnerability in a crucial American standard for data encryption. On Monday, she was scheduled to explain her discovery in a keynote address to an international group of researchers meeting in California.
But a stand-in had to take her place, because she was not able to enter the country. Indeed, only one of nine Chinese researchers who sought to enter the country for the conference received a visa in time to attend.
Although none of the scientists were officially denied visas by the United States Consulate, officials at the State Department and National Academy of Sciences said this week that the situation was not uncommon.
Lengthy delays in issuing visas are now routine, they said, particularly for those involved in sensitive scientific and technical fields.
The visa snag angered organizers of the annual meeting of the International Cryptology Conference, who argued that restrictions originally created to prevent the transfer of advanced technologies from the United States are now having the opposite effect.

A New Vulnerability In RSA Cryptography
    Posted by kdawson on Saturday November 18,     from the predictions-of-trouble dept.
    romiz writes, "Branch Prediction Analysis is a recent attack vector
    against RSA public-key cryptography on personal computers that relies
    on timing measurements to get information on the bits in the private
    key. However, the method is not very practical because it requires
    many attempts to obtain meaningful information, and the current
    OpenSSL implementation now includes protections against those attacks.
    However, German cryptographer Jean-Pierre Seifert has announced [1]a
    new method called Simple Branch Prediction Analysis that is at the
    same time much more efficient that the previous ones, only needs a
    single attempt, successfully bypasses the OpenSSL protections, and
    should prove harder to avoid without a very large execution penalty."
    From the article: "The successful extraction of almost all secret key
    bits by our SBPA attack against an openSSL RSA implementation proves
    that the often recommended blinding or so called randomization
    techniques to protect RSA against side-channel attacks are, in the
    context of SBPA attacks, totally useless." [2]Le Monde interviewed
    Seifert (in French, but Babelfish works well) and claims that the
    details of the SBPA attack are being withheld; however, a PDF of the
    paper is linked from the [3]ePrint abstract.

@_subject: Interesting new stego application 
Hiding messages in plain sight
Mobile phone reads an invisible code
The phone can read invisible images on printed paper
A technology that can "hide" information in plain sight on printed images has begun to see the first commercial applications.
Japanese firm Fujitsu is pushing a technology that can encode data into a picture that is invisible to the human eye but can be decoded by a mobile phone with a camera.
The company believes the technology will have spin off implications for the publishing industry.
"The concept is to be able to link the printed page into the digital domain," said Mike Nelson, general manager for sales operations at Fujitsu Europe.
The technique stems from a 2,500-year-old practice called steganography, which saw the Greeks sending warnings of attacks on wooden tablets and then covering them in wax and tattooing messages on shaved heads that were then covered by the regrowth of hair.
Fujitsu's technique works by taking advantage of the sensitivities of the human eye, which struggles to see the colour yellow.
"The key is to take the yellow hue in the picture and we skew that ever so slightly to create a pattern," said Mr Nelson.
"A camera is perfectly sensitive to that yellow hue but the human eye doesn't see it very well.
"Any camera, even those in mobile phones, can decode it very easily."
Pictures printed with the technique look perfectly normal but a camera can see the code printed into the image.
The technique can currently store just 12 bytes of information - soon to rise to 24 - the equivalent amount of data in a barcode.
That data could be a phone number, a message or a website link.

This (if I'm understanding you correctly) is exactly the thing that the web of trust [1] is intended to address. One issue with the web of trust is how to bootstrap it.

Sounds like an interesting idea - using SRAM state as a source of randomness. Any of the folks here willing to comment on this?
Initial SRAM State as a Fingerprint and Source
of True Random Numbers for RFID Tags
Daniel E. Holcomb, Wayne P. Burleson, and Kevin Fu
University of Massachusetts, Amherst MA 01002, USA,
{dholcomb, burleson} kevinfu at cs.umass.edu
RFID applications create a need for low-cost security and
privacy in potentially hostile environments. Our measurements show
that initialization of SRAM produces a physical fingerprint. We propose
a system of Fingerprint Extraction and Random Numbers in SRAM
(FERNS) that harvests static identity and randomness from existing
from run-time physically random noise. We use experimental data from
virtual tags, microcontroller memory, and the WISP UHF RFID tag to
validate the principles behind FERNS. We show that a 256byte SRAM
can be used to identify circuits among a population of 160 virtual tags,
and can potentially produce 128bit random numbers capable of passing
cryptographic statistical tests.

When the government announced last month that a top-secret spy satellite would, in the next few months, come falling out of the sky, American officials said there was little risk to people because satellites fall out of orbit fairly frequently and much of the planet is covered by oceans.
But they said precious little about the satellite itself.
Such information came instead from Ted Molczan, a hobbyist who tracks satellites from his apartment balcony in Toronto, and fellow satellite spotters around the world. They have grudgingly become accustomed to being seen as ?propeller-headed geeks? who ?poke their finger in the eye? of the government?s satellite spymasters, Mr. Molczan said, taking no offense. ?I have a sense of humor,? he said.
Mr. Molczan, a private energy conservation consultant, is the best known of the satellite spotters who, needing little more than a pair of binoculars, a stop watch and star charts, uncover some of the deepest of the government?s expensive secrets and share them on the Internet.

@_subject: Malware using good crypto 
Interesting article. Anyone here have experience trying to
reverse-engineer malware that uses really good crypto?
It is not unusual for malware authors to obfuscate various components
that are nested inside one another like so many Matryoshka dolls all in
a bid to stymie researchers and anti-virus companies. But Stewart said
the criminals behind Clampi have encrypted or obfuscated nearly every
aspect of the malware -- including the lists of e-commerce sites
targeted, the data stolen, and Clampi's various feature plug-ins --
multiple times, and with very strong encryption (Matryoshka Mafia image
courtesy FreakingNews.com).
Typically, password-stealing Trojans contain a list of a few dozen
banking institutions that the malware will look to steal data from if
the victim visits those sites. But according to Stewart, Clampi's
authors aren't just targeting banking sites.
"They are targeting institutions where users may enter data that might
be useful in stealing money, such as utilities, retail, online casinos,
banking, insurance, accounting services, credit bureaus," Stewart said.
Stewart says Clampi is targeting credentials from some 4,600 Web sites,
though so far he says he's only be able to identify about 1,400 of
those. The list below gives the reader some idea of the breadth of sites
targeted by this malware:
Advertising networks
Email marketing
Stock brokerages
Market research databases
Online casinos
Career sites
Credit card companies
Accounting Services
Wire transfer services
Mortgage lenders
Consumer databases
Foreign Postal Services (Non-US)
Military/Government information portals
Recommendation engines
Various News blogs
File upload sites
According to Stewart, the information stolen by Clampi is sent from the
victim PC to a Web server controlled by the attackers using a
randomly-generated session key with 2048-bit RSA encryption. This
technology is used to obfuscate data being stolen, so that in theory,
only the attackers who have the encryption key can intercept or read the
stolen data.
"On top of that, they're using 448-bit Blowfish encryption," Stewart said.

RSA 1024-bit private key encryption cracked
Researchers find weakness in security system
By Network World Staff | Network World US
Published: 13:26 GMT, 05 March 10
Three University of Michigan computer scientists say they have found a
way to exploit a weakness in RSA security technology used to protect
everything from media players to smartphones and ecommerce servers.
RSA authentication is susceptible, they say, to changes in the voltage
supply to a private key holder. The researchers ? Andrea Pellegrini,
Valeria Bertacco and Todd Austin - outline their findings in a paper
titled ?Fault-based attack of RSA authentication?  to be presented 10
March at the Design, Automation and Test in Europe conference.
"The RSA algorithm gives security under the assumption that as long as
the private key is private, you can't break in unless you guess it.
We've shown that that's not true," said Valeria Bertacco, an associate
professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer
Science, in a statement.
The RSA algorithm was introduced in a 1978 paper outlining the
public-key cryptosystem. The annual RSA security conference is being
held this week in San Francisco.
While guessing the 1,000-plus digits of binary code in a private key
would take unfathomable hours, the researchers say that by varying
electric current to a secured computer using an inexpensive
purpose-built device they were able to stress out the computer and
figure out the 1,024-bit private key in about 100 hours ? all without
leaving a trace.
The researchers in their paper outline how they made the attack on a
SPARC system running Linux. They also say they have come up with a
solution, which involves a cryptographic technique called salting that
involves randomly juggling a private key's digits.
The research is funded by the National Science Foundation and the
Gigascale Systems Research Center.

I have heard in a past discussion on this list that the NSA employs some
significant fraction of all people who have postgrad degrees in crypto
related topics in the US. Does this mean that the private sector now has a
significantly larger talent pool for security related jobs?
The National Security Agency is losing its top talent at a worrisome rate
as highly skilled personnel, some disillusioned with the spy service’s
leadership and an unpopular reorganization, take higher-paying, more
flexible jobs in the private sector.
Since 2015, the NSA has lost several hundred hackers, engineers and data
scientists, according to current and former U.S. officials with knowledge
of the matter. The potential impact on national security is significant,
they said.
Headquartered at Fort Meade in Maryland, the NSA employs a civilian
workforce of about 21,000 there and is the largest producer of intelligence
among the nation’s 17 spy agencies. The people who have left were
responsible for collecting and analyzing the intelligence that goes into
the president’s daily briefing. Their work also included monitoring a broad
array of subjects including the Islamic State, Russian and North Korean
hackers, and analyzing the intentions of foreign governments, and they were
responsible for protecting the classified networks that carry such
sensitive information.
