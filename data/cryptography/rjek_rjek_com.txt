@_subject: [Cryptography] Can we move this list to an online forum please? 
IME, people who prefer fora over mailing lists do so because their mail
client is awful, and/or there isn't a searchable archive of the list.
Than what?  Mailing lists once set up require next to no administration
at all, and moderation is trivial (and often web-based nayway)
So not moderated?
Mail client issue.  Most web fora don't thread, and has a dedicated site
rather than landing in my mail client.
That's because everybody top posts on fora!
Mailing lists can have these.
Why does anybody want these?
In the Lua programming language world, a few years ago this topic
turned up too.  The mailing list is still going with ~3000 subscribers
with a high SnR, and the fora that spawned has perhaps a dozen people on
it, and has had routine downtime while security issues in whatever
software they're chosen that's written by rogue clowns in PHP.

Daniel Silverstone, the author, specifically advises people to not use

Linux has both of them, but they're user-land calls.  Sandy is refering
to what happens in kernel land.
Hopefully not the monotonic clock, but the wall clock!

@_subject: [Cryptography] Review: The Code Book, by Simon Singh 
This is perfectly well-spelled, given the author uses British English
rather than Amerian English, given he's British.  I'm surprised you
didn't notice the correct spelling of colour in his explanation of DH
using tins of paint :)
