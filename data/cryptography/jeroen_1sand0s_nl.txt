@_subject: [Cryptography] Introduction to EC that is actually an 
The introduction from djb and Tanja Lange at 31C3 last year was excellent. It has the right build up and contains all the necessary elements to properly understand EC crypto. The slides can probably be found there, and otherwise djb has them on his homepage. Jeroen.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Collisions w/SHA-1 ~$100,000 TODAY 
Collisions in SHA-1/crypto are a problem when you can generate a collision for a given value, which would mean you could create fake values.
A freestart collision is one where you get to decide on both values, so you are not going to end up with a “useful” collision. But the technique is a first step towards being able to generate a regular collision.
At least, that’s how I tried to explain it to people.

The very first TLS certificate of Letâs Encrypt is now live: The actual certificate is installed at Their root-certicate, from the ISRG X1 (Internet Security Research Group), is not yet in the trust-store. They hope to achieve that by November.

@_subject: [Cryptography] distrusted root CA: WoSign 
Mozilla already announced they are planning to distrust StartCom, since WoSign has not been transparent about buying WoSign. Plus there are signs that they are even sharing infrastructure.
Apparently, when bugs were found in StartEncrypt several months ago, they also found a bug where it was possible to get StartEncrypt to issue a WoSign cert(!) for December 20th 2015.
They are planning to distrust future certs, so there is not that much stuff breaking for the “lusers”.
