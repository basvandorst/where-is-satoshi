@_subject: [Cryptography] ratcheting DH strengths over time 
Relative security margin at some point in the future is always going
to be a guess. Quantum computers will, for instance, have an outsized
impact on the security of DH, but should have no appreciable impact on
the security of AES, which will decay at a different rate; and the
actual rates of decay of both are completely unknown at this point,
and furthermore likely to be very bursty for both.
This guess isn't completely blind, however, and so if you have some
information that needs to remain secret for 20 years, the best you can
probably do is to look at current developments in crypto and number
theory research and choose primitives that are likely still to be very
hard to break 20 years from now. You'll probably be right on some of
them and wrong on others, but you literally can't do any better
because you can't predict the future.

(...or the NSA?) No. Even presuming >0 of the N parties can resist the
influence of the US/Chinese/Russian/etc. governments, that's still not
good enough. What the NSA et al. want is the ability to decrypt *all
traffic all the time* so they can scan it for whatever it is they're
looking for or archive it for future reference.
Exceptional access isn't what they want. Routine access is what they
want, without a warrant, and certainly without public knowledge or
approval of what they're looking for. Parallel construction
demonstrates that the government doesn't even need to reveal the
information they've scanned in order to achieve whatever political
objectives they have.
