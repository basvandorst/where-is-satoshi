hi,does anyone here use / used TrueCrypt?
i did some mistakes and update from 7.1a to 7.2 then it became impossible to browse the files on windows explorer cuz by what it seems the partition loose NTFS filesystem and became RAW, TrueCrypt 7.2 mounted the volume/partition with success but i was unable to browse the files,i then proceed to install 7.1a version again and tried to browse files without succcess,i then proceed to VeraCrypt installation but the problem persisted..
in the middle of this i decided to check disks hardware cables and there was a cable not connected,i then proceed to connect and boot the OS and try to mount and browse files but it not work..
i've tried to convert the RAW partition to NTFS using built-in windows tool but it didn't work, i've even tried to use DISKPART and SET ID=07 (NTFS) and fixboot,etc do not worked also..
i've tried lots of recovery tools such as Recuva which says "invalid boot sector" and "invalid size partition",i've then decided to try fix Boot Sector using testdisk and it didn't work..
suddenly i manage to decrypt encrypted volume on TrueCrypt 7.2 or VeraCrypt -- do not remember which one,but the task seem to stay at an infinite loop at 100%,i decided to kill process then manage to decrypt all using 7.1a,the thing is when i open TrueCrypt / Veracrypt the "Resume Interrupted Process" option it appears but whenever i try to resume i get the error "Truecrypt has not found any volume where bla bla,etc please make sure the password blala are correct" and i get unable to decrypt..
i've a recovery tool called "m3 data recovery" seems good but don't find any data..
the thing is i've did lots of mess,how do i get the data again without doing more mess?
thanks in advance.

i don't have backups this is the problem..
this is not FDE, it's just a volume/partition of one disk encrypted..
I did a clone of the volume/partition using testdisk but then had to delete it cuz i was running without space..
at this point i think i just want to finish decryption at "Resume Interrupted Process",if this option its present its because it did not finish right?
do you recommend any software to detect volumes/partitions on disk and software to retrieve data from RAW volumes/partitions?
here TestCrypt detects this this is the point where TrueCrypt "hanged" a bit

I care,i did try to make backups but i run without space and had no
optical media..
i did try to ask for help in 3 different forums and didn't obtain any
answer,this is why i decided to ask here,perhaps someone did same
mistake and had the solution..
im still seeking for help if you can instruct me to manage to get the
data it would be fine.
thanks in advance..
