But I think that this is exactly what must be pointed out when entering a
debate on these issues. Yes, cryptography has been used widely in a military
context, and yes, it is still very much used in that context *BUT* the main
area where its civil uses are visible is exactly in Netscape/IE -- and in
particular when dealing with money. Online banking, online purchase etc.
etc. It wouldn't be widespread if the companies involved wouldn't go with
it. The companies involved have gone in to it at a high rate until at least
somewhat secure communications could be established (at least not
non-snake-oil companies); and for secure communications -- i.e. "Can I trust
that no-body steals my credit card?" -- is ensured by cryptography.
The next step in the debate is as I view it to point out that a key escrow
solution -- which probably would appear quickly at this stage -- is
 a) unlikely to be adopted by criminals -- how many actually expect fanatic
terrorist to _upgrade_ to a version _publicly_ acknowledged to contain
CIA/FBI/NSA/WHOEVER backdoors?
 b) not likely to avoid attacks by people trying to crack the scheme; and
once that succeeded, potentially even less secure than plaintext...

Though, when not targetting desktop-size processors; or targeting not quite
so standard processors, there is quite a lot to be won on hand-optimizing...
I've spent three periods at Ericsson Mobile Communications working extra
side to side with my studies, optimizing RSA under various circumstances.
The first time I went in, I worked on their implementation of WTLS --
specifically the hand-shaking part of the protocol -- and got a code snippet
with the kernel add-and-multiply loop that executed in 25 minutes (sic!) for
a standard handshake situation. Hand-optimizing the C-code yielded --
together with a minor algorithm change -- an execution-time on less than 1.5
This is an extreme example, but still...
