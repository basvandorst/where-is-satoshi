[Hello Moderator: I am not certain what 'top posting' means.  I think possibly that I need to flip the order perhaps. Please let me know if I am wrong on this. Regards,  Jack]
Am I correct that the found PGP flaw appears to only affect enciphered e-mail traffic and not files that are enciphered by PGP but not mailed?
I use PGP to protect sensitive files on my laptop when traveling etc.
