You have given english sentence of 12 words as passphrase. If we count
about 2.5bits of information per word and hash without adding salt, it
results in about 2^30 combinations. When we divide it over botnet of
1000 computers, each must try about 10^6 hashes. I guess you can
calculate the rest of the anwers.

I think in weird ways.  :-)  The rationale behind it follows:
I assume that the passphrase is in syntactically correct English. So,
number of possible combinations is reduced by the great amount. Also, I
 want to reduce the number of combinations, so I focus on the most
probable sentences.
It seems ideal to use some stochastic grammar to describe this problem.
This type of grammar can be used to produce:
1) probabilities for the sentences so:
2) estimate of shannon entropy (which allows me to estimate bits per
sentence or per word and possibly to craft more effective algorithm to
walk through the space)
At this point I did a little test for one phrase and played with it a
little. I wanted to know, how likely is that using stochastic grammar
description, someone can infer that passphrase. I asked google for
aproximate count on phrases (results sorted by count):
"had a look" 2100000
"had a car"   591000
"had a little lamb" 590000
"had a drink" 562000
"mary had a little lamb" 522000
"had a fight" 466000
mary had a little fleece white snow 322000 //not a phrase
"had a president" 80200
"had a snow"   42400
"had a lamb"   27300
and also:
"I have been there"  947000
"to rescue"         2190000
"had" 1.2E9
"is"  3.68E9
"the" 5E9
"a"  7.2E9
seen clearly, that "had a little lamb" is common phrase (relatively,
between similar phrases). It can be also seen, that the whole rhyme has
about an half count of phrase "had a little lamb".
At this point I decided not to continue further and assumed, that this
passphrase has very low information content, so I used value of about
2.5bits/word (which don't seem unreasonable when looking at the numbers
above). I didn't calculated the actual value, it can be higher or lower.
If the passphrase is "The car looked at me with a telescope.", I would
estimate it higher (unusual combination of words).
Thinking about that original passphrase at character level shannon way
is incorrect. It overestimates information in that sentence. Word level
is better, but still not good enough. Information content is
overestimated by many, especially for political speeches.  ;-)

In fact, I see security questions as a security weakness.
My typical answer is random garbage, such as output of pwgen -s -y 48 1. This can be discarded then. Or, at least, gpw 1 60 (gpw output is less secure, but can be stored, remembered, and even written in on simplified  > I can just see the day when someone's fingerprint is rejected as

:-) Or iris scan, or body dimensions. I call it security through stupidity. :-)
But never mind, these people will be picked up by by government datamining as un-normal (terrorist suspects) and imprisoned. Problem solved.
