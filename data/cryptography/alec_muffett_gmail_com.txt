The first person jailed under draconian UK police powers that  Ministers said were vital to battle terrorism and serious crime has  been identified by The Register as a schizophrenic science hobbyist  with no previous criminal record.
His crime was a persistent refusal to give counter-terrorism police  the keys to decrypt his computer files.

Perry: plasma physics is wildly OT but I believe the relevance will be  obvious to those who remember the crypto wars, especially when they  hit the fifth paragraph:
short: "There but for the grace of Bernstein?"  Or something like that... :-)

@_subject: FileVault on other than home directories on MacOS? 
Just as an aside: on 10.5 and upwards I have taken to using encrypted  sparse bundles rather than simple images; the advantage of doing this  is that if you are creating a encrypted filesystem on (say) a 16Gb  FAT-32 USB stick, then:
a) you are not constrained to a 4Gb encrypted image (otherwise to FAT32)
b) when using the sparse image, your files can be >4Gb
c) you do not eat the entire stick all at once
d) there can be (is?) a degree of garbage collection
e) the stick is still usable as FAT32

@_subject: OTR splicer for Skype ? 
I found the following Adium-based solution for layering OTR atop Skype     ...and was wondering whether anyone has generalised this by creating  some open-source, standalone, simple application which talks to the  Skype client API and splices OTR into the channel?
Just wondering.

This may[1] be relevant to your interests; alas I am not fit to review the math...
  That QC currently defeats "all common codes" was unknown to me; I must get round to dumping all my credit cards.

@_subject: Haystack redux 
Flamewar seems to have broken out:
I've had issues[1] with some of Morozov's previous writing[2] but if EM is reporting accurately how Haystack is deployed - let alone used - then even laying aside Kerckhoffs' principle / the lack of code transparency - I would fear for anyone using it seriously.
All it would take would be one little bit of malware in the samizdat zipfile...

All of the disbenefits of passwords are the same as their benefits, bar
one, as explained here:

@_subject: [Cryptography] Snowden "fabricated digital keys" to get access

My own, personal guess is that it is obfuscation which translates as "using
passwords" or "accessing a portal over SSL" plus "we're too embarrassed to
admit that it was that easy".

@_subject: [Cryptography] Boing Boing pushing an RSA Conference boycott 
The boycott proposal is purely punitive. They have no demand. Which is a
"You're absolutely right, Phil; yes one way or another RSA's products wound
up running this bowdlerised and backdoored RNG and stories abound that they
got paid a pittance to sell-out the security of all their users of their
benchmark product, but really the important thing here is that they provide
a consolidated, near-monolithic industry conference circuit with effective
vendor lock-in - you have to show there or not exist! How dreadful it would
be for us all to have to tromp around Infosec, Blackhat, USENIX all over
again and start sponsoring small events like 44con... it would be a return
to the 1980s / early 90s and you remember the hangovers - we as an industry
would just not be able to cope as an industry or as individuals. It would
be harmful to security overall.
My God, I might have to start using Twitter seriously..."
I think what they are demanding of RSA is that RSA hurt, or someone's head
rolls, or ideally that RSA dies, Phil.
Making an example of them for sleeping with the enemy. For selling out.
That sort of reason. It's an end in itself.  "This is the head of a
traitor", sort of thing.
Or, as you put it, "punked".

@_subject: [Cryptography] Passwords: Perfect, except for being Flawed 
Some of us have been preaching this gospel for years. :-)
*The problem with password security is that the disbenefits are exactly the
same as the benefits:*
   1.
*passwords are easy to deploy - which means they're used everywhere *
   2.
*passwords are easy to manage - which means they're managed haphazardly *
   3.
*passwords don't require identity linkage between silos - but people are
   generally too lazy to maintain more than one or two identities *
   4.
*passwords are scalable - but people are generally too lazy to remember
   more than one or two passwords *
   5.
*passwords can be varied between silo - but people are generally ... see
   above *
   6.
*passwords don't expire - but most of them are guessable in a matter of
   minutes or hours *
   7.
*passwords are 'something you know' - and so anyone who knows your password
   is indistinguishable from you *
*And since you don't need to pay to get a new password, nor to maintain an
old one - the password paradigm is forever going to be a roadblock in the
path of those who wish to become rich by issuing certificates or identities
that will permit you to transact on the web - or those who desire central
control of such a resource. This may be a benefit or disbenefit, depending
upon your perspective.*
