I'm not sure why no one has considered the PC banking problem to be a
justification for secure computing.  Specifically, how does a user know
their computer has not been tampered with when they wish to use it for
banking access.

This first case is actually quite amusing.  I was recently the subject of identity theft.
Specifically, the thieves had my SSN (SIN, actually, since it is in Canada), and my
driver's licence number.  They produced a fake driver's licence, and used it to open
bank accounts in my name.  When this all came to light, the bank wanted a notarized
document that said that I did not open these accounts or know anything about them.
And what was required for notarization?  I had to go to city hall and get someone
who had never met me before to look at my photo ID (which was my drivers and sign the form saying it was me!  Great system!

target product is some embedded device intended to sell for $10 to $20 and/or if
the target product is part of a system in which millions of such devices are intended
to be used.
