I believe these terms also apply for ACM publications (but you might want
to check), not sure about IEEE.

But the analysis still holds of course, the modulus is just an upper bound, and  this is just me being pedantic.

@_subject: Anyone familiar with ntru?  
Without having the opportunity to have a really good look at NTRU, the
basic deal is that the NSS algorithm (including some of the fixes) is
pretty much completely broken.  There was a good paper on the break given
at Asiacrypt 2001.  NTRU seems to have admitted defeat and basically
chucked away the whole NSS design and started again and are now using
something called NTRUsign. None of the attacks on NSS were attacks on the
underlying hard problem though, so NTRUSign may survive. But it kind of
makes you nervous.
