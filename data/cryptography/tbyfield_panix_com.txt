@_subject: [Echelon: new documents on economic espionage and human rights] 
----- Forwarded In a major report to be published this week, the Echelon committee of the European Parliament has found that the conduct of electronic surveillance activities by US intelligence breaches the European Convention of Human Rights even when conducted, allegedly, for law enforcement purposes. It concludes that if the British and German governments fail to prevent the improper use of  surveillance stations sited on their territory to intercept private and commercial communications, they may be in breach both of community law and of human rights treaties.
In collaboration with the British journalist Duncan Campbell, the online magazine Telepolis today launches a package of Echelon-
related material on the WWW.  Four new studies on "Interception Capabilities - Impact and Exploitation" were commissioned by the Temporary Committee on the Echelon Interception System of the European Parliament in December 2000. They cover the use of communications intelligence (COMINT) for economic purposes, legal and human rights issues, and recent political and technological developments. Among the key topics covered are the documentary and factual evidence for the existence of the COMSAT (communications satellite) intercept system known as "ECHELON". These studies were presented to the Echelon Committee at its Brussels meeting on 22 and 23 January 2001.  The fourth study, on new political and technical developments, was presented only in the form of a slideshow.   These studies are published with permission from the secretariat of the Echelon Committee. Introduction and summary in an article by Duncan Campbell:

IC2001, paper 1: ECHELON and its role in COMINT
This paper summarises the evidence for the existence of ECHELON as a global interception system.  It records official admissions about the secret UKUSA agreement that links English-
speaking signals intelligence organisations. The paper also provides detailed answers to questions put by the Committee. It points out that very few media reports have provided original new information about Echelon, and that many press reports have enlarged on the nature of the interception systems and their capabilities, without evidence. IC2001, paper 2: COMINT impact on international trade
Paper 2 sets out, with detailed sources, the case that from 1992 to date Europe is likely to have sustained significant employment and financial loss as a result of the U.S. government policy of "levelling the playing field", introduced in 1991.   It also refers to:
Annexe 2-1
Background papers about the U.S. Trade Promotion Co-ordinating Committee (TPCC) and the Advocacy Center, including statements of purpose Annexe 2-2
A questionaire for U.S. companies to answer in order to determine whether or not they are deemed "American" and thus qualify for official assistance. The questionnaire is also on the internet
Annexe 2-3
Documents revealing the CIA's role in U.S. trade promotion,  obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. IC2001, paper 3: COMINT, privacy and human rights
This paper reveals that Britain undertakes to protect the rights of Americans, Canadians and Australians against interception that would not comply with their own domestic law, while offering no protection of any kind to other Europeans.    This and other background papers provided to the Echelon committee have prompted them to observe that "possible threats to privacy and to businesses posed by a system of the ECHELON type arise not only from the fact that is a particularly powerful monitoring system, but also that it operates in a largely legislation-free #  distributed via : no commercial use without permission

 <...> ms. kolata developed quite a reputation for herself when she was cover-
ing the AIDS beat in, iirc, the late 80s and early 90s--as an utter in-
competent who'd gladly flog FUD if it would advance her career. ACT-UP
put a surprising amount of energy into putting a spot light on her.
i dunno whether that was a factor in the NYT's decision to not to give
on an anthrax beat, but it looks like she's found another angle.

this wasn't my experience. between ~noon and ~6, i didn't receive
this warning between houston st (= '0th' st) and 110th; but later it was *sporadically* turned off around w 110th.
i don't think the relationship was so clear.
however, a very limited sample did suggest that single-band (i.e.,
domestic) phones were working while, side by side, 'world' phones weren't.
