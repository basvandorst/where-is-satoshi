My understanding of UK law is that it's illegal to listen to *any*
channel that's not meant for public broadcast. You are, however, legally
allowed to listen in using receive-only equipment to any channel which
does have a public broadcast license or that is intended for general
consumption by the public (ie. FM broadcast radio, Ham & CB radio, WX &
Nav traffic).
That being said nobody has been prosecuted for this type of offence in
the UK AFAIK. And they don't actively police this in the same way they
to the television license fee.
