Never! The design goal of java - being a secure language by removing
pointers and having exceptions - was entirely achieved.
Also, python (php,golang,...) programs are known to have no security issues at all.
If someone forgets to check certificates, doing it the wrong way,
allocated too short buffers or relies on untrusted input: Blame it all
to the language.
"safe programming languages" for the lulz. There is no such thing.
Theorem: The safer and easy-to-use the language is, the more stupid bugs will come around.
php showed us the hard way that for "safe languages", bug classes are rising
that nobody would have thought of before.

NUMS and NOBUS isnt really new, thats why standards like for the
Brainpool parameters exist. Indeed, reproducability should be
applied for other primes too. Related to this, it should
also be applied to compiler generated code (binaries), i.e.
reproducable builds.
To cope with NOBUS/NUMS in ECDH, have a look how opmsg is handling this
via cross-domain ECDH:
The basic idea is to use the intel compartments that aims to
protect the NOBUS secrets to build strong keys.
