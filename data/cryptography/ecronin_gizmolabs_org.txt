RC4 when used correctly (which I believe it is in TLS) should not  concern you much.  What should concern you, however, is that Apple  has chosen to include a testing/debug NULL cipher in their production  (and completely unmodifiable w/o recompiling System.framework)  This means that a malicious server can negotiate Safari into using no  encryption at all, while still providing all the GUI feedback of a  secure SSL connection...
For fun, fire off this command and visit localhost:4433 from both  firefox and safari, and look at the packet dumps in ethereal (use any  snakeoil server.* you have handy):
-cipher 'AES:TLSv1:ALL:NULL:!RC4-SHA:!RC4-MD5:!DES-CBC3-SHA:!DES-CBC- I filed a bug with Apple on this back in February, I encourage others  to do so as well at   Ask them to include the  AES ciphers while you're at it, it's only been 5 years or so since it  was standardized...

I  haven't looked at their implementation closely in several years, but  back in 2002 or so they were using CSD (modem-modem calls) instead of  the broadband channel, trading bandwidth for low jitter...  With  current CPUs and audio codecs you can get decent voice quality over

Does anybody have a recipe for this first mode handy?  plain text e- mails seem simple enough, but there needs to be a bit of MIME  unwrapping and rewrapping to correctly handle attachments so that the  client sees/decrypts them correctly I think.  I've searched from time  to time and never found a good HowTo...
