Not to get too far off topic, but a lot of martial training
among captive and oppressed peoples has been hidden in innocent
seeming activities. Capoeira is the most famous. Players would
switch from fighting to what appeared to be dance to outsiders
depending on the situation - e.g. if the authorities were around. A lot of instruction was or is encoded in song and
musical rhythm. To the initiate it is full of meaning. To the
outsider it is just tunes.
Is it steganography? Undoubtedly yes in the larger sense.

@_subject: Voynich manuscript proven a hoax (yet again). 
Not exactly news. The groundbreaking work was done on this a couple years back. If I recall
correctly the team found that it was probably a variant on period templated writing devices.
Now, if someone could make sense of the Codex Serafinianus that would be news...
