@_subject: [Cryptography] Hiding parties identities 
Another option is to have multiple "key identities" pointing to the same
key so that the client can rotate them and thus conceal third parties
from knowing (until no more identities are left).
A way to overcome that would be a method to update the key identities on
both client and server. Either by having an out of band API for that or
by using a deterministic scheme.
For example, by using a _second_ shared secret one could construct key
identities like this  KeyID[n+1]=hmac(KeyID[n],PSK2).
That operation could be done by both client and server on each use (so means updating&syncing state). To make it more reliable multiple
key-identities can be employed that roll over in some fashion, to heal
problems from loss of synchronization between the parties.
This scheme would accomplish both session-unlinking to third parties and
efficient keyid->psk mapping (assuming the mapping is done in a tree
