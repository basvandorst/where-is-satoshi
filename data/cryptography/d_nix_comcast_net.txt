Is this not essentially alt.anonymous.messages, etc?

To be *completely* clear, that is the work of the vastly more
competent and knowledgeable Tom Ritter; I merely have mastered the cut
& past functions in Thunderbird.

Hah hah hah. Uh, reading between the lines, color me *skeptical* that
this is really what it claims to be, given the current understanding
of things...

The question isn't whether it's what it claims to be.  It is that.  But
is it's *more* than it claims to be.
Yes, in my haste I neglected the "only" disclaimer bit; it is indeed a
means by which the *rightful owner/administrator* might perform very
useful tasks. The obvious crux of the biscuit is *who else* has
access, and what can they do surreptitiously?
If for example, the paper regarding manipulating the RNG circuit by
alternate chip doping is valid, then an adversary with deep pockets
and vast resources might well be able remotely target specific systems
on demand. Possibly even air gapped ones if this function is
controllable via a 3G signal as I have read elsewhere.
Or perhaps just outright reroute and tap information prior to
encryption, or subtly corrupt things in other ways such that processes
fail or leak data. A universal on-demand STUXNET, if you will... Yes,
idle unfounded speculation, I know... but still... these days the fear
is that we're not paranoid enough.
Hmmmm. Maybe time to pull my old 1996 SGI R10K and R4400 boxes out of
storage. For a few *very* dedicated and air gapped tasks they might be
a small measure of worthwhile trouble.

It's also worth pointing out that common browser ad blocking / script
blocking / and site redirection add-on's and plugins (NoScript,
AdBlockPlus, Ghostery, etc...) can interfere with the identification
image display. My bank uses this sort of technology and it took me a
while to identify exactly which plug-in was blocking the security
image and then time to sort out an exception rule to not block it.
The point being - end users *will* install plug-ins and extensions
that may interfere with your verification tools.
