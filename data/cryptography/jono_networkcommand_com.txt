Submit your comments regarding the SSSCA here:
See below:
As I mentioned a couple of days ago, I sent a comment about mandating
DRM technologies for general purpose computers.
I just received the following message in response.
: We are no longer accepting comments via e-mail, as we have created a new,
: web-based submission form.  I encourage you to please re-submit your : comments at  .  I have resent the comment using that web address and now fear
that the formatting will be all messed up.
The good news, however, is that when I resubmitted my message to
the web site I was shown all the comments that have been received
by the Committee so far---there are quite a few of them---AND
NOT A SINGLE COMMENT SUPPORTS MANDATORY DRM TECHNOLOGIES.
It may be worthwhile to encourage others to send their comments
to the Committee.  Overwhelming opposition by the public---that
is publically available---may be hard for politicians to ignore.
The comments are available at For those of you who have connections with the press, you might
inform them of this reaction by the public.  I should think
that it would make an interesting feature story: Public Repudiates the Mouse.
