David Wagner wtote:
Indeed it is. But what about
    pseudo-random = AES_{noise}(k)
[splitting noise into appropriate blocks] - as long as AES is
believed to be secure against a known plaintext attack?
SHA1 should be faster anyway.

@_subject: VeriSign unveils new online identity verification services 
No, no, no! Not "identities" - they establish the complete financial
backgrounds of web customers. Where have all the ingenious ideas
from the cryptologic research gone? Credentials? Pseudonymous
transactions? ...
This is completely irrelevant - "We ensure that we don't give
this information to parties that don't pay us."
VeriSign misuses cryptologic terminology for business reasons.
