@_subject: Proving security protocols 
there are several soures to investigate. a nice survey "varieties of secure distributed computing" by matt franklin
and moti yung introduces lots of protocos with proofs of
security for most. the survey is available on the net, and includes a huge bibliography list form where you can carry on.
Other names i'd mention are andrew yao, martin abadi, joan
feigenbaum, don beaver, phil rogaway , silvio micali, isai kushilevitz, shafi goldwasser, claude crepeau, michel luby, and oded goldreich. ah, i'm forgeting joe kilian. their work shares light in the direction you seek, but i have seen no comprehensive work on the literature.

@_subject: Hijackers' e-mails were unencrypted 
It seems reasonable to me that the plane attacks have been planed for
years and not in the last minutes. So that there is probably no need
to send mesages between parties in the latest moments. Maybe only a
sign like the "chalk mark in the pavement" from Hanssen's case, or
a simple orangutan photograph on  will do.
I think that people are being misdirected by the news. I think that
researchers and security experts should be wiser enough to notice.
What about these posts I have been seeing of "steganographed" material.
Where is it? Can anybody find it? Because so far, 20 days after the attack, I haven't seen a single piece of evidence but what was first
seen on TV. I write this message only to point out this mistake I
believe people are commiting, and not as a political statement. ===============[ CORE Security Technologies ]===============

@_subject: Kerchoff's principle 
Look up his article "criptographie millitaire" (writen in 1883) at
it is quite interesting.
the prnciple basically states that a cryptographic protocol's
security should not relay on the knowledge of how does the protocol itself is, e.g., you should always suppose that the
algorithms and related data used during the protocol's execution
(other than specific private data such as private keys) are known
to the attackers.
This principle is considered a MUST in the construcion of cryptographic protocols and primitives.

@_subject: [FYI] Did Encryption Empower These Terrorists? 
I'd say that terrorist do not much care about laws such as a non-encryption law. Come on. Authorities should know better
than that: a team able to get the technical accuracy needed
for driving high-tech comercial planes won't be able to circunvent an encryption watch? On the other hand I think that this would be a great opportunity for passing whatever ridiculous law that
the legislative power came up with. But they do it all
the same. So...
greetings to you all,

Hi to you all! A word on this thread. I think you are giving missleading
assertions. It's just a subtlety I'd like to mention.
Perhaps you should simply notice that getting a one-use-only webmail email account and sending the message "the bird is flying home" or any James  Bondish message like that to another one-time-use-only webmail
account is also steganography. You hide a message between millions
of messages within millions of accounts! It is impossible to browse and identify all those messages as dangerous. And that is because they aint. However, having a particular message,
photo, or any piece of digital information and trying to gain
from it is quite a different task. Here steganography as you speak could
enter the scene. My feeling is that there is no generical tool for handling all the sensible inf traveling through the web and that it's
construction should be dimmed (theoretically) impossible. However,
practical solutions to specific and well defined problems can and are devided daily. I hope you see my point.
