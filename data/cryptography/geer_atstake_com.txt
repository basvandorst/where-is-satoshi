Wireless networks have no interior.  Merging them with a
perimeter-protected network will yield a network with
the character of the wireless net.  This is at once the
the beauty of community nets and the end of network security
as a principle area of focus -- the apps are where the action
is now.  Within my firm's experience, fully 70% of the fatal
application vulnerabilities seen in the field are design flaws
so there is certainly work to be done.
