Agreed; but regarding unix systems, I know of none crypto
implementation that does integrity checking. Not just de/encrypt the
data, but verify that the encrypted data has not been tampered with.
A however unlikely and far-fetched analogy would be someone altering
an encrypted root fs so that f.e. /etc/hosts.deny would decrypt
differently. Such things tend to stay unnoticed when not some kind of
IDS is used, for the very fact that all the common (more or less
skillfully crafted) crypto implementations simply fail to do
integrity checking; dm-crypt, loop-aes, mainline cryptoloop,
truecrypt, bestcrypt, CrossCrypt, ...
However, though preventing the unnoticed modification of an encrypted
device is undoubtedly a goal to strive for, this is not what those
crypto implementations try to achieve. They just work towards safely
and reliably de/encrypting one's data; some more, some less.

Thanks to you both; and good to see that ecryptfs is actively
maintained. I might check it out myself but I'll definitely link it.
I'm interested as well in watermark/dictionary attacks (like on
mainline cryptoloop) on ecryptfs. Something like mentioned here,
Users of ecrypt are also encouraged to share their views on
stability/reliability of ecryptfs.
