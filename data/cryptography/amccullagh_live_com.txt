Hi everyone;
In 2001, the first public court case dealing with Key loggers was published.  The case is SCARFO v. US.  In that case, the FBI was tracking an alleged mafia member.  He was using PGP to encrypt messages between him and an accomplice.
The FBI could not decrypt the message so they developed 2 malware applications or maybe 3 (not surer about this as I have not read the case for sometime).  The FBI had worked out that SCARFO was using PGP so they surreptitiously loaded the first malware which basically searched for the PGP private key ring and sent the entire ring by FTP to the FBI address.  The malware then deleted all traces of the transaction from SCARFO’s machine and then deleted itself.
Once the FBI had the PGP private Key ring they needed the pass phrase to activate the PGP and thus be able to decrypt all future correspondence.  They did this by loading a second piece of malware which was a key-logger.  The key-logger lay in wait until PGP was activated and then recorded (I think is was the next 100 characters) typed in.  The key logger then packaged this information up and sent it by FTP again to FBI.
All of this information is detailed in the Affidavit of an FBI agent which can be located on the EFF site.
Now I am not sure about this but the FBI either had a third malware application or the second malware had extra functionality but every time SCARFO sent an encrypted message to his accomplice the message was also sent to the FBI.
So my question is, “is it possible for some malware to steal an entire BIT COIN wallet and copy a passphrase and then the perpetrator can spend someone else’s bitcoins”.
Just a thought.
I obviously could be naive or just do not understand how BITCOIN wallets operate.
Any assistance in this would be greatly appreciated.  All of the SCARFO docs can be located at EFF.org.
Kind regards

@_subject: [Cryptography] =?utf-8?q?What_do_we_mean_by_Secure=3F?= 
Dear All,
If my memory serves me correct, Ed Yourdan in the late 1970?s once said (paraphrased my me and is analogous to Schr?dinger's cat ) that a secure computer is a computer that is not connected to any network, turned off with no power and locked in a room and the access mechanism (the  key) has been lost and even then he was not sure that the said computer was secure.
Also Winn Schwartau is attributed with the following simple time based concept of a secure computer system:
S(t) > D(t1) + R(t2)
Basically if the detection time of an attack plus the reaction time is less than the time it takes to break a system then the system is secure.
Now this is a basic concept but how one detects an attack and what actions are to be undertaken by way of reaction are still unsettled to secure a system.
Obviously, Yourdan?s was making a point that a really secure system is unrealistic and uncommercial. I also remember Professor Bill Caelli once telling me that the US Navy had developed an A1 (TCSEC) operating system in the 1970?s but unfortunately it was entirely unusable and was later abandoned.  Compromise has to be taken and it really depends on each situation.  The real problem is that most organisations do not undertake the basic risk assessment to understand what their respective risk appetite is.
In not understanding their respective risk appetite they are not is a position to ever know whether the so called secure system fits within their respective position.
On top of this, all systems are complex and since they was designed and developed by human?s mistakes will occur.  As such it is highly unlikely that a real secure system will ever be developed that can be used effectively by end entities.  Consequently, it is for experts like the people on this group to assist where they can.
In the end the term ?secure? is too vague to be used as it will mean different things to different people and organisations/entities.
Just my thoughts.  Sent from Windows Mail

Dear All,
I with 4 colleagues of mine (3 at the Queensland University of Technology (Cryptographers all)and one from the University of Queensland (Legal E-commerce researcher) have been working on a paper dealing with the Australian Defence Trade Control Act which corresponds to the proposed US ITAR changes.
Without giving everything away on our forthcoming paper, it appears to me that if this type of regulation had been in place in Germany in 1938, then it is highly likely that Einstein would never have read the Hahn - Strassmann paper dealing with splitting a uranium atom.  That paper written in 1938 (December I believe) was read by Einstein in March 1939 and it directly lead to Einstein sending a letter to Roosevelt, which in turn resulted in 1942 to the establishment of the Manhattan project.  Now if NAZI Germany had restricted that publication NAZI Germany could have developed the bomb itself which could have completely altered the outcome.
Basically, if regimes like the ITAR rules are expanded then it works both ways and there could be a stifling of publication research due to bureaucratic mishandling.  Though it could assist in the spy business as in the cold war.

I think this is the appropriate list to solve this problem.
Maybe you have heard of the airbus crash in Germany. The door to the cockpit was locked and one pilot was inside and one outside. Even for the toilet pilots have to leave the locked space. And the crew knows the pin to open the door and there exists even a crew wide known and for the plane or company never changed  security code, which opens the door for 30 secs.
In case a person wants to attack one person outside the cockpit this in many cases possible.
At the turkish or cyprus airport even glas bottles, Coke oneway metal bottles or forks from the restaurant are available at the gates.
If we suggest a setting that no one outside knows the code, Does a zero knowledge approach (see wikipedia) work or is a third party authentication from tower needed to unlock the doors? Any suggstions?

With the continued development of Safety Critical products that are dependent upon software does any one know of any standards that specifically deals with the security issues for safety critical software.
I am aware of IEC 61508 but this standards does not specifically deal with the security of such software even SIL 3 or SIL 4 do not as far as I can determine deal with security from hackers.
The reason for this request has arise from the recent hacker attack of the Jeep automobile.  With the continued development of autonomous vehicles and other devices it is something that I feel needs to be addressed before it is too late.
If there is not such a standard then does the group think that such as standard warrants being developed?

Darkpassenger wote:
afaik within some countries and regions there are organizations that have procedures
to examine a software for critical applications and gives series of evaluations for
"security level" of the target . like Common Criteria , CC , and AEL levels in the
U.S or there are many MIL-STDs in NATO area..
is this what you are talking about ?
No that is not what I am talking about.  I am fully aware of the Common Criteria (IEC 15408) and Target of Evaluation and EAL (Evaluated Assurance Levels).
What I am looking for is:  “Is there a specific standard dealing with security for safety critical software”.
I am aware of the Software Engineering Institutes work on Capability Maturity Models.
It appears to me that presently there is not a standard dealing with the development of security from the ground up in the development of Safety Critical Software.
I am simply asking the question as to whether there is such a standard and if so where I can get a copy of it.

I'm not anti-regulation myself - I think there are many things that *need* to be regulated.  But regulation should be targeted where it's appropriate - and it should be the minimum regulation needed to accomplish some important policy goal.  Demanding that the FTC define "strong cryptography" and then mandate, on its own, which applications require it, strikes me as a good way to generate tons of new regulations that will do more harm than good.
Keep in mind, too, that any regulation has to be quite explicit - to cite the kind of thing that drives people nuts, you can't write a regulation that says "fire extinguishers must be at a height that most people can get at" because no one will be able to objectively test if someone is in violation; so instead you end up with a mandate that says "fire extinguishers must be hung 60 inches above the ground" and you end up fining people who hang them at 61 inches.  Also, once a regulation is in place, it becomes almost impossible to change it because of the costs.  That's a disaster in a field moving as rapidly as cryptography has been.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Proposal of a fair contract signing protocol 
Dear All,
I do not understand the unfairness that is being discussed.  Alice’s intention until Bob signs is actually irrelevant.  The issue is if Bob delays too long then at law there may be through conduct or lack thereof, a rejection of the offer sent by Alice, which will be decided on the reasonable person approach.  That is, what would a reasonable person viewing the activities of both parties conclude based upon the relevant actions or inactions of either party.
The law especially contract law has some very perculiar rules when dealing with non face to face communications; the postal rule in particular but this rule has rightly been cut down substantially over the years by the courts. In dealing with near instantaneous communications like email I do not see any unfairness.  It is always possible for the contract to involve counterparts which involves two copies of the same document; one signed by Alice and the other signed by Bob.  The counterparts are exchanged so that each party then has 2 copies of the signed document with appropriate signatures included.
This type of contracting has been around for more than a century.
Am I missing something from this discussion.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Proposal of a fair contract signing protocol 
Hi Allen,
Alice signs the contract and sends it to Bob for his signature.  A few months later, Bob claims he signed the contract and returned it the same day.  How do you propose proving the time that Bob signed the contract, if his email client can simply forge the time sent header, and Alice's can simply forge the time received, or forge the unacknowledged messages saying "Hey, where's the signed contract?"
Firstly, when Alice signs the email/document there is no contract.  She actually signs an offer which if accepted by Bob will convert into a contract as then and only then is there a meeting of minds to form an agreement.  For there to be an acceptance at law it must in most cases (Postal rule is an exception) be communicated to and received by the offeror.
So there appears to be an impass as Alice claims she did not receive the acceptance, which at law is difficult.  It is from an evidential perspective difficult to prove the negative which in this case is that Alice did not receive the fully signed document thus forming the contract.  On the otherhand, Bob has the easier task in proving the positive as he only has to prove that he signed the document and sent it but also that Alice received the signed document.
Obviously, a three way handshake could prove this but I do not know where this has been implemented for document signing.

Dear M.K. Shen,
What you are proposing just does not make commercial or legal sense.
The law does not work for your proposal.
There can only be a contract if there is agreement as to what Alice offers.  If Bob simply ignores the offer then no agreement arises.  Only is very rare cases can there be a deeming of intent to create an contrcat.
There 5 basic elements in the creation of a contract/agreement to be enforceable at law:
·       An offer is communicated from person A (Alice)
·       Person B (Bob) unequivocally accepts the terms of Alice’s offer and communicates that acceptance to Alice;
·       There is consideration supporting the agreement/contract;
·       There is an intention to create legal relations which for the most part is determine by an objective test but can be inferred in a commercial setting as opposed to a domestic setting (family arrangements); and
·       Both parties have legal capacity to be bound by the terms of the contract.
The acceptance must be communicated  and for the most part received by the offeror for there to be a contract.  Bob is under no legal obligation to do anything with Alices Offer.  As far as I am aware that is teh law in all common law countries which includes teh UK, USA, Canada and Australia.
Unless I am missing something and with respect this proposal of yours will not be accepted by the law or by commerce.  In essence I still do not see any unfairness.

Dear MK Shen,
I do not understand your terminology “against the law”.  If you mean criminally illegal then no it is not against the law ibut f you mean not legally enforceable under civil law then I see your protocol as being unnecessary and frankly overly complicated from a commercial perspective.
If Alice does to receive the acceptance communication (excluding the postal rule which I doubt would apply) even though Bob may have sent his acceptance there is no contract.  Further the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (1999) deals with receipt of communications from a legal perspective (section 15).  My understanding is that this law has been enacted in more than 46 US States (though I have not recently checked).
In my law practice I advise my clients that if the acceptance is important then telephone the other side to satisfy themselves that the acceptance has been received.  Further take a diary note of the call and ask the otherside to send an acknowledgement.  Basically a three way handshake with an out of bounds communication.
If the acknowledgement is not received within a reasonable time then call again.  The whole exercise is to obtain as best as possible some evidence to support the acceptance being received by Alice.
Again, I do not see how your proposed protocol provides the evidence that a court will need.  Further, are we talking about minor contracts (less than $500) or contracts required by law to be in writing (statute of Frauds).
It is the value of implementing this that also needs to be taken into consideration.

You are entirely right that "Bob is under no legal obligation to do
anything with Alices Offer". The issue in the present thread assumes
however that Bob considers Alice's offer to be acceptable and does
step 2 and the protocol comes to an end with Alice doing step 3,
producing the contract document C and showing that it is signed by
both Alice and Bob. Now the question is whether the contract signing
process is fair. My argumentation is that it is indeed fair according
to the fairness definition I have given.
Is the matter now clear to you?
I don't fully understand your last paragraph: (1) If Alice and Bob
choose to do as desribed in my protocol, is that against the law??
(2) If you don't see any unfairness in what is done in the protocol,
then all the better for me, isn't it?

@_subject: [Cryptography] FBI engages Isreali company to crack IPhone security 
Hi Everyone,
Am I being cynical but is the public enagement of Celebrite by the FBI a public relations exercise.
Without taking away the extensive amount of technical knowedge and skill of cellebrite has (an isreali company), I would be very surpirsed if they would have more expertise than that which the NSA possesses.
Now, let’s say for argument sake the NSA has already cracked the Iphone seccuirty but does not want the general public to know that.  Then the FBI is on a no lose situation. Either way, the FBI can say that Celebrit cracked the Iphone secuirty and the general public is none the wise.

Actually *Apple* sometimes considers bulk purchases of iPhones to be suspicious.  (Sometimes they consider purchases of iPhones with cash suspicious and decline them.)
This has nothing to do with terrorism - it has (or had) to do with a big demand for iPhones in China.  There was a whole "gray market" supply chain set up to buy them here (eventually by hiring mules) and ship them to China for sale at premium prices.  Ironic when you think about where they were built!
This is pretty much obsolete now as Apple sells directly to China in a big way.

The real problem with this is that many people will be caught by the marketing blurb and really think that they are 100% safe.
Maybe the FTC should be notified about this type of advertising.   Unless the software is thoroughly tested independently and the source code reveiwed or the specification at least there no way on knowing what hidden vulnerabilities exist.
Too many used car salemen are getting in on the security bandwagon because they think it is an easy sell.
