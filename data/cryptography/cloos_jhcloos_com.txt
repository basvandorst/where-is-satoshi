No, in general it is not unspoofable.
But you probably need the gateway into the PSTN to use SS7 and IMT
trunks; and that probably means a CLEC license in the US, or similar
elsewhere.  That presumably means more substantial civil and criminal
penalties for spoofing with criminal intent, not to mention the
potential loss of the operating license for doing so.
So although it is certainly doable, it'll be expensive and likely
beyond the means of small-time players.
In short, if you have direct SS7 access, there isn't much you cannot
do to screw over other providers and their customers.  Hense all of
the rules and regs for getting such access.

It should be doable as just a RNG device for a BOM of a few tens of USD.
There are at least of couple of SoCs on the market which advertise USB
client hw and at least some onboard crypto.  Put one of those in a key-
sized container with just enough glue for an A plug and the hw is done.
The software should be easy enough.  Linux's gadget driver can claim to
be pretty much anything -- serial, storage, ethernet.  I presume the
various BSD's can do so as well.  So the software end should be easy.
Are there any HW engineers here who can flesh out the above into a
gerber file or similar?

It is called modular arithmetic.  So not just idiomatic, but expected.
Is there really anyone who has learned to code who doesn't understand
that an N-bit register does math modulus 2^N?  Or how twos-complement
math works?
(There may be some these days unfamiliar with ones-complement, but
unfamiliarity with unsigned modular arithmetic and twos-complement
signed modular arithmetic seems to contradict an understanding of
how current computers work.  And understanding how a given chip works
seems prerequisite to understanding how to code for it.)

NSS has 1.2 now; it is, AIUI, in progress for ff and sm.
Chromium supports it (as of version 29, it seems).
Opera supports 1.2 (at least as of version 12, maybe earlier?).
Arora 0.11.0 doesn't seem to provide a way to check....
Links and elinks only did tls 1.1.
I don't see a way to get lynx or w3m (text browsers), midori, luakit or
xombrero (webkit-gtk) or qupzilla (webkit-qt) to report the tls version
details.  So I cannot confirm what webkit can do.
A bug report from 2011 for polarssl mentions that ie9 can do 1.2.
I don't think there is anything else I can test.  With it in openssl, gnutls, nss, polarssl, et alia support seems pretty
complete.  It will take some time for the current ff alpha to filter
down to a "release", but otherwise things look good on the 1.2 front.

There was a lengthy discussion about which is best on one of the crypto

gpg lists, the ietf openpgp wg list or coderpunks?
It mostly discussed whether it is better to hide the signature or permit
verification w/o decryption.
Some even suggested doing s-e-s, possibly with different signing keys.
IIRC, the result was that each option has value in different circumstances,
but I do not recall whether there was a consensus on the ideal default.

Re multiple encryptions, has anyone looked at whether stacked
encryptions in motion lead to any extra weakness?
In particular, things like tls over wifi, ipsec/wifi, tls/ipsec,
tls/ipsec/wifi, pgp or smime over tls (over ...), et cetera?
Often the users have no choice; what may look like tls over clear
channel to them may have multiple encrypted hops.  Some hops may
even have stacked encryption already.
Imagine grabbing a pgp-encrypted file over https over a vpn to the
office over "ethernet" service which is provided as a point-to-point
encrypted vpn routed over mpls, over a "wavelength" service which is
provided via an encrypted piece of a shared wavelength over fibre optic
snake oil.  (I'm sure everyone can guess which oil.)
(Perhaps someone can come up with a deeper potential stack?)
There is the potential that aes might get used at every layer.  Is that
a risk?
Other combinations?
Does such stacking affect traffic analysis?
I've been curious about this for a while, but since there is little one
can do about it I never spent much time researching it.  Has anyone?

In order for that mis-rounding to occur, the compiler must mis-optimize
the code.
The /2 will get changed to >>1 (right shift).  Because bits in an int
rather than an unsigned int, that will be an arithmetic right shift.
The +1 might get converted to an INCrement.
To round up, the optimizer would then need to swap the order of the
increment and the shift.
If the compiler is mis-optimizing that, it is not surprising that it
might also mis-optimize something else later on, resulting in an
exploitable bug.
But it would have to be specific to an architecture and compiler.

I presume that the real error in the compilation occurs later; the
quoted part is likely just an additional, minor error which is an
easy way to differentiate affected compilations.  Like a canary.
The note Ian quoted did not claim that the mistmatched p and q were
the cause of the bug, but rather that later miscompilation were.
