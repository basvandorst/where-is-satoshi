@_subject: Netscape co-founder Clark debuts new extranet start-up 
- A good number of CIOs and heads of IT infrastructures have insufficient
  security background, too. But they all know who James Clark is and
  understand the magic phrase "zero client admin."
  Meaning, it's all in the market positioning.
- Ok, I guess it isn't IPsec. I'll bet it is something like running local
  application proxies which tunnel thru the browser's SSL connection back
  to the corporate office.
I'm not affiliated with Neoteris. Haven't seen their web site nor their
product. Did dream up a similar product about two months back: My intended
market positioning for it _is_ "zero client admin."
