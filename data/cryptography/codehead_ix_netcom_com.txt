@_subject: Starium (was Re: article: german secure phone) 
In the spring of 1999, at the request of a VC, I went to a garage. com meeting where one of the Starium versions was demonstrated.  At the time it was "a bump in the line" version, but instead of having a "green light" indicator, there was a 4-digit LCD display.
Eric Blossom said that the display showed the last four digits of the Diffie-Hellman key that was negotiated at the start of conversation.  The participants in the conversation could read the digits off and confirm that there had not been a MITM attack.
An LED "encryption" indicator cannot give a clue as to whether such an attack has occurred.  However, I don't see how either an LED or a LCD display can defeat a physical attack where the board/chip(s) in the unit itself are replaced.
But I don't think this revision was necessarily what killed Starium's device.  The VC that I did the review for said that one of Starium's people told him that they really didn't intend to manufacture the device, but wanted to sell out the company to some large outfit that would.  Apparently no company wanted to pick them up at whatever price they were asking.
The rumor going around VC circles is that Starium burned through four megabucks before imploding.  As of spring, 1999, I believe that they'd already gone through almost half of that.
Too bad.  At their presentation, Starium execs said that they thought that the "bump in the line" model would sell for "under $100," and ASICs for cell phones could be manufactured in quantity for as little as $5 a pop.
