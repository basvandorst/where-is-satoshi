In context, the "Arms" that are protected are "Those that a current
military would be using." and not constrained to a particular point in
time. One could argue that various communications technologies would
fall under that. After all, a General has to communicate his orders to
his troops. Given the way the US Gov treats these various
technologies, it would seem to fall in line. My dad was in the Air
Force during Viet Nam. He set up, operated, and maintained microwave
communications networks. They undertook mechanisms to reduce the
chance of communications interception.
As for the canon comment earlier, privately owned canons were on the
list of items to be seized at the battle of Concorde/Lexington, which
was the impetus for the Second Amendment. Constitutionally speaking,
it protects any arms necessary to serve Letters of Marque, the power
of which to grant is enumerated in the Constitution. This power shows
intent as to the level of weaponry the Founders expected to be in the
hands of private individuals.
Additionally, it was always an individual right, it just wasn't
contested until more recently. The analysis shows the intent, that
intent didn't just spring into being in 1960. SCOTUS affirms what is,
it doesn't create things.
