3. Cryptography, and therefore PKI, is meaningless unless you first

only see one person even mention "threat model".  Think about the
varying threat models, and the type of cryptography one would propose

encrypted web forms for hiding credit card numbers, suffers from

The union of the two sets of "cryptography users" and "paranoid
people" is necessarily non-empty.  Who would bother to use
cryptography sans a threat model?  And if you've got a non-empty
threat model, then by definition you're paranoid.

Yes, you're right (and Phil Pennock points out that I meant
"intersection", not "union").  Dictionary.com defines paranoia as
"Extreme, irrational distrust of others."  I'm not using the correct
word here (nor are other people), because there are rational reasons
to distrust nosyparkers.  So what *is* the right word for having a
non-empty threat model for moderate and rational reasons?

But a bear is a decidedly non-empty threat model.  Here's two of my
favorite quotes (I made 'em up, myself, so natch I like 'em):
    "Crypto without a threat model is like cookies without milk."
and "Security is never without cost."
I think that the reason that the vast majority of computer users don't
use cryptography is because the value of cryptography in addressing
their threat model is lower than the cost of dealing with cryptography
(user interfaces ++ key management ++ not leaking information ++
secure storage).  Okay, so some people might say "But if it weren't
for the NSA opposing widespread crypto use, it *would* be easy to
use".  Dealing with the NSA's opposition is part of the cost of
dealing with cryptography.

Can't be done.  I don't have time to go into ALL the reasons.
Fortunately for me, any one reason is sufficient.   it's all about
the economics.  You have failed to specify that the cost of breaking
into the data has to exceed the value of the data.  But even if you
did that, you'd have to assume that the data was never worth more than
that to *anyone*.  As soon as it was worth that, they could break into
the data, and data is, after all, just data.
Ignore economics at your peril.

You're wearing your programmer's hat when you say that.  But the
problem isn't programming, but is instead economic.  Switch hats.  The
changes that you list above may or may not offer some security
advantages.  Who cares?  What really matters is whether they increase
the cost of copying.  I say that the answer is no, for a very simple
reason: breaking into your own computer is a "victimless" crime.
In a crime there are at least two parties: the victim and the
perpetrator.  What makes the so-called victimless crime unique is that
the victim is not present for the perpetration of the crime.  In such
a crime, all of the perpetrators have reason to keep silent about the
comission of the crime.  So it will be with people breaking into their
own TCPA-protected computer and application.  Nobody with evidence of
the crime is interested in reporting the crime, nor in stopping
further crimes.
Yes, the TCPA hardware introduces difficulties.  If there is way
around them in software, then someone need only write it once.  The
whole TCPA house of cards relies on no card ever falling down.  Once
it falls down, people have unrestricted access to content.  And that
means that we go back to today's game, where the contents of CDs are
open and available for modification.  Someone could distribute a pile
of "random" bits, which, when xored with the encrypted copy, becomes
an unencrypted copy.

Well, one of the things that PGP/GPG/OpenPGP got right is the web of
trust model.  Given that model, there is nothing preventing someone
from imposing a certificate authority on top of that web.  On the
other hand, I know of know way to make S/MIME work without a
certificate from an authority.

@_subject: Cryptography as a component of security 
I listened to yet another talk on computer security, which
incorporated security.  It got me to thinking two things:
  o Pseudo-random implies pseudo security.
If you're re-keying by running the old key through a pseudo-random
function without adding any new entropy, then you're not re-keying at
  o Security is not an absolute value.  It only makes sense as a
    relative value.
You cannot say that a system is "secure".  You can only say that it is
secure against a certain threat.  It's quite reasonable to say that
GPG using a 2048-bit key is secure against all known attacks today.
You've defined the threat ("all known attacks today") and the type of
cryptography.  Any kind of claim of "security", without defining what
the expected attacks the system will withstand, are *inherently* snake
Let me say this again in the strongest possible terms: even if you are
using industry-standard cryptography (e.g. RSA, Triple-DES, AES, etc),
and yet you do not define your threat, then any claims that your
system is "secure" are claims about snake oil.
Maybe I'm preaching to the converted, but apparently you can get a PhD
and apply for funding without understanding these issues.

Yup.  That's why I think that the MTA that checks the signature should
surround the RFC2822 address comment with '?' if the signature is
missing or bad.  If the email lacks a valid signature, you really
*don't* know who it's from, so the question marks are simply telling

Before I could send the previous email, I had to tell Perry to accept

Huh?  Somebody is confused here.  DomainKeys is 1) an e-mail

it uses cryptographic signing using public/private keys which have the

Yes, this is true.  John Gilmore is a pain in the ass for standing on
his rights (some government types might say *fucking* pain in the
ass), but he is correct.  ALL of the effort spent to secure open
relays was basically wasted effort, because spammers just moved on to
insecure client machines.  The proper route to control spam is to
involve users in prioritizing their email, so that their friend's
email comes first, followed by anybody they've sent mail to, followed
by people they've gotten email from before, followed by mailing list
mail, followed by email from strangers (which is where all the spam
is).  All of that relies on email authentication to work.
Why the heck can't we just shortcut all this pain, and just listen to
John in the first place?  I vote to elect John to the post of

Cryptography is not about math; it's not about secrets; it's not about
security.  It's about economics.  I'd really like to see people NOT
talk about the security of cryptography, but instead of about the cost
of it.  If the cost of breaking a system exceeds the value of an
identifiable message, nobody will bother breaking it.  If the cost of
using a system exceeds the value of the system, nobody will bother
using it.

This is true, however, I've seen Dan Bernstein (and you don't get much
more careful or paranoid about security than Dan) write code like
static char line[999];
  len = 0;
  len += fmt_ulong(line + len,rp);
  len += fmt_str(line + len," , ");
  len += fmt_ulong(line + len,lp);
  len += fmt_str(line + len,"\r\n");
Of course, the number of characters that fmt_ulong will insert is
limited by the number of bits in an unsigned long, and both strings
are of constant length.

Cryptographer's hat off, economist's hat on. No, Bitcoin *can* rise
forever, and it predictably *will* rise forever.
A currency can be viewed in several ways. One, as the product of a
suspended barter between two people. Two, as a commodity which
everyone will take in trade because everyone will take it in trade
(yes, I am aware of the recursive nature of that definition.)
When people are free to trade as they wish, every trade creates value,
whether it be barter, goods for goods, or a currency trade for goods,
then a goods trade for currency. So the entire value of the economy is
constantly rising, even if no new goods are produced, even if nothing
is consumed.
I'm underlining the key point in the next paragraph.
What happens to the currency in this situation? What if there is a
fixed amount of the currency (which is a feature of Bitcoin)? _As new
goods are brought into the economy_, whether by import (e.g. by
Overstock.com announcing that it was entering the Bitcoin economy) or
by production of new goods, more goods may be purchased with the
currency, but there is not new currency being made. So, the value of
the currency goes up ........ _without limit_.
Now, people are getting a bit confused, I think, by Bitcoin mining. As
our own Ben Laurie has pointed out, the computation needed to create
bitcoins is not an essential feature. What is important, though, is
that Bitcoins were easily gotten at first, and the growth of bitcoins
in the economy slows down. People are thinking that bitcoins are
becoming more valuable because more people are chasing
them. No. Bitcoins are becoming more valuable because you can buy more
things with them, and because as people trade, the value of bitcoins
Bitcoin's crypto is pretty simple. It's just a signing system. "I
discovered this hash; here's my key." "I'm giving this much of this
key to that key." It's more like a bearer title system than ecash
(particularly given the transaction time of about an hour).  The
hashing thing is just a way to distribute bitcoin more-or-less
fairly at the beginning -- and we're still at the beginning.
Satoshi is more of an economist than a cryptographer.

Let's say that they can. That means that the contribution to the

I was trying to be funny, to dampen the pain of having your mistake
called out. That didn't work; my apologies. And you *were* wrong,
because you mentioned crypto without mentioning the threat
model. SERIOUSLY. "Crypto" is one hand clapping without a threat model
to clap against.
We *all* know that all cryptography can be cracked; it's just a matter
of resources and time. Therefore, complaining about weak cryptography
is meaningless unless you say what you're defending against, because
ultimately, ALL crypto is weak. It's only in the context of a threat
model that we can evaluate the security of cryptograhy. Pig latin is
effective against a two-year-old. Norwegian is effective against an
English speaker (as my parents well understood). ROT-26 is effective
against people who don't know how to read.
You know this. You just forgot. I was just reminding you.

Indeed. By the time you set up a powerline interface, you may as well
just reverse-bias a diode, compare it to a low-pass-filtered version
of itself, and capture that noise.

Besides simply not having code linked into the program (and thus the
code doesn't need to be audited), a smart linker can do an execution
analysis of the program and keep frequently-executed code in the same
kernel block. That ensures that all that code which handles all those
weird exceptions is never even loaded into memory.

I already do that, and it works quite tell. The "private key" that I
use is chosen from a keyspace of billions, and has 5000 valid
entries. This key is of course the sender's email address.

There may come to be a time when this algorithm no longer works, and a

Epostage works fine, or at least the implementation of it does. "If

the message there. If your email is worth reading, I'll send you the
