Preimage Attacks on 41-Step SHA-256 and 46-Step SHA-512
Abstract. In this paper, we propose preimage attacks on 41-step SHA-256 and 46-step SHA-512, which drastically increase the number of attacked steps compared to the best previous preimage attack working for only 24 steps. The time complexity for 41-step SHA-256 is 2 253.5 compression function operations and the memory requirement is 2 16 ? 10 words. The time complexity for 46-step SHA-512 is 2 511.5 compression function operations and the memory requirement is 2 3 ? 10 words. Our attack is a meet-in-the-middle attack. We first consider the application of previous meet-in-the-middle attack techniques to SHA-2. We then analyze the message expansion of SHA-2 by considering all previous techniques to find a new independent message-word partition. We first explain the attack on 40-step SHA-256 whose complexity is 2 249 to describe the ideas. We then explain how to extend the attack. 1

Looks like Adi Shamir &Co have been having a little fun?
Study Suggests Link Between Dread Pirate Roberts and Satoshi Nakamoto
Two Israeli computer scientists say they may have uncovered a puzzling financial link between Ross William Ulbricht, the recently arrested operator of the Internet black market known as the Silk Road, and the secretive inventor of bitcoin, the anonymous online currency, used to make Silk Road purchases.
Dorit Ron, a computer scientist at the Weizmann Institute, and Adi Shamir, a pioneering cryptographer who is a member of the applied mathematics faculty at the Institute, will publish a paper Sunday exploring how the 29-year-old Mr. Ulbricht, who was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in October and has been charged with a murder-for-hire scheme and narcotics-trafficking, acquired and protected the estimated millions he made in commissions operating Silk Road. The researchers say Silk Road, at the time of Mr. Ulbricht?s arrest, had sales of $1.2 billion, generating $80 million in commissions. A huge run-up in the value of bitcoin in the last month has exponentially increased those amounts.
However, the researchers added, they believe the F.B.I. has seized only about 22 percent of the commissions they have identified, and that they themselves have only been able to trace about a third of the total.
The Silk Road site, which has been called an ?eBay for drugs? was intended to permit any kind of anonymous transaction between buyers and sellers of illegal goods or activities. It was shut down when the F.B.I. arrested Mr. Ulbricht, who used the Internet identity ?Dread Pirate Roberts,? while he was sitting in a public library in San Francisco near his home.
The two scientists have been exploring the web of financial transactions produced by bitcoin, the anonymous currency that has drawn the attention of both law enforcement and federal regulators in recent months. Their research is made possible by the fact that while bitcoin is designed to protect the anonymity of buyers and sellers, the actual transactions are public. Earlier this year, the researchers obtained a complete listing of all bitcoin transactions and have since been exploring the ?graph? of those interactions in an attempt to gain statistical insights into user behavior in the anonymous financial market.
After Mr. Ulbricht was arrested last month, the scientists used public information to begin tracing Silk Road-related transactions. Among their discoveries was a particular transfer to an account controlled by Mr. Ulbricht from another that had been created in January 2009, during the very earliest days of the bitcoin network, which was set up the previous year.
Although the authors state that they cannot prove that that account belongs to the person who created the bitcoin currency, it is widely believed that the first accounts belong to a person who identifies himself as ?Satoshi Nakamoto,? but who has remained anonymous and has not been publicly heard from since 2010.
Individual bitcoin is generated using a cryptographic algorithm that requires computer-processing power and that insures that each coin remains unique and cannot be copied.
After seizing Mr. Ulbricht?s computer, the F.B.I. spent several weeks analyzing data, determining that the laptop contained a digital wallet with 144,336 bitcoin, currently valued at more than $122 million, which the agency has attempted to freeze.
In tracing various transactions made to and from Mr. Ulbricht?s account, the authors found an intriguing one involving the transfer of 1,000 bitcoin, which would have been worth $60,000 when it was made on March 20 of this year, but is now worth roughly $847,000.
They write: ?Such a single large transfer does not represent the typical behavior of a buyer who opens an account on Silk Road in order to purchase some narcotics (such buyers are expected to make an initial deposit of tens or hundreds of dollars, and to top the account off whenever they buy additional merchandise). It could represent either large-scale activity on Silk Road, or some form of investment or partnership, but this is pure speculation.?
The mysterious account that made the investment had at one point accumulated 77,600 bitcoin, mostly through ?mining? operations, an amount which would now be worth approximately $64 million.
?The short path we found suggests (but does not prove) the existence of a surprising link between the two mysterious figures of the bitcoin community, Satoshi Nakamoto and DPR,? the authors write, referring to Mr. Ulbricht as the Dread Pirate Roberts.
In addition to the curious transaction, which they say they cannot explain, the authors said they discovered that much of the bitcoin accumulated by Mr. Ulbricht has remained beyond the F.B.I.?s grasp.
The scientists note that, for technical reasons, seizing and controlling bitcoin from a computer is a much greater challenge for law enforcement than illicitly obtained cash stored in a safe. With bitcoin, its very design may make it possible for its support community to move to thwart law enforcement or any resale of the digital tokens.
In addition, the scientists speculated that the reason the F.B.I. had not recovered all Mr. Ulbricht?s bitcoin might be that he was using a second computer that has not been located.
Dr. Ron and Dr. Shamir noted that despite the fact that the F.B.I. closed the original Silk Road black market, a second ?Silk Road anonymous market? has been created since.
Satoshi Nakamoto?s actual identity remains a hotly debated topic among Internet researchers. A number of individuals claim to have discovered his true identity, but those assertions have either been denied or ignored by those named.
The F.B.I. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Dang kids. Get offa my lawn.
It?s been interesting, I?ll say that much. I have people on their honeymoon here in .ai asking to see me, buy me and Mrs. RAH $30 hamburgers at Viceroy, etc.
Or ?prove?, ?stylometrically", on various Bitcoin fora, that I'm Satoshi. Heh. I?ll never get tired of braggin? about *that* one. :-) I expect others here know where the stylistic clues came from, but I think Grigg has the right approach to that question. Leave well enough alone.
Being, even now, generally optimistic about the future, if not my own in particular, I can?t help thinking there?s a pony in there somewhere. I *do* find it annoying that the only time people wanna talk to me about this stuff is at the top of a bubble. I expect that it may be a hint from the Almighty I should pay attention to. At the moment, PayPal, which we all looked down the nose at back then, is still, um, printing money, and a cypherpunk gave me some BTC a little while ago, a kind of eating-the-dog food exercise for old time?s sake. Or something. The price has since fallen 40%, but it?s bouncing back, and will probably be fine. ?You have to be *this* tall to take this ride?, as another friend said about Bitcoin prices last week. Meanwhile I can?t think of anything I want to spend it on anyway.
Even in its current form, Bitcoin makes rather short work of those speed bumps Mr. May used to tell us about, which *may* be the real point to the exercise.
Having to file several kinds of forms to get paid for a small consulting job as US citizen outside the US was enough to make me foreswear getting paid for much of anything anymore, anything small at least, and BTC solves several problems there quite handily, push ever came to shove. Besides, my passport is stamped ?Employment Prohibited?, which, apparently, I?m evidently honoring even in the breach.
So, I think BTC, or something like it, would make a nice numeraire, temporary or otherwise, having gnawed at the edges of *that* problem when most of the Bitcoinners were, as Marc notes, in short-pants. Yes, even in its current volatile state. And contrary to the opinions of people who know better than I do about these things.
It wasn't quite what Dr. Fama got the Nobel for, but New Monetary Economics might be as good once as it ever was, and Bitcoin might be the camel?s nose under that particular tent, and given that it is the ultimate fiat currency that?s quite an assertion.
As someone whose stated goal, back in the day, was to securitize *everything*, debt, equity, cash, services, title to assets in storage, transit, or just sitting there with a house on it, cats, dogs, mass hysteria -- and all derivatives thereof -- using bearer-transaction financial cryptography protocols on a ubiquitous geodesic public internetwork, Bitcoin *is* a bit, oh, please let me say it, self-referent as a solution. I saw it blow by here on this list, said, ?meh?, shortly had the magic smoke go out of most of my internet presence by a power-spike in a hurricane, and never got around to paying attention to either Bitcoin, or the internet, very much at all until various people frog-marched my attention back into focus recently with me muttering variously about being too old for this shit anymore...
So, Bitcoin, if it survives, makes a *nice* hack, by solving, what Barnes, and ultimately everyone else, called the ?loading problem?. And, so far at least, it solves the ?and then you go to jail? part of the book-entry transaction error-handler, something Barnes was also noted for saying. That, too, only if Bitcoin survives. "...any [network] architecture that can survive a nuclear attack can survive withdrawal of government subsidy...? Godwin said on Cyberia, long ago. I?ve jokingly called it his Second Law. I suppose the Strong Form of that hypothesis, speaking of Dr. Fama, is surviving not mere withdrawal of the implicit subsidy of monopolistic contract enforcement, and all transfer-priced assets and ?externalities? appertaining thereto, but also active attack from the ostensible contract enforcer itself.
I hear of others, well, gnawing around the edges, actually, of securitizing other stuff with variants of the Bitcoin protocol, but, like predicting the end of the world, expanding the blockchain to other assets "has not been found agreeable to experience.? So far as I can see.
Meanwhile, Chris Odom, aka, ?Fellow Traveller?, aka, ?Lovedrop? (yes, *that* ?Lovedrop?), is banging away on something called Open Transactions, which inserts an actual transaction protocol, among other much more interesting things, into the works to glue Bitcoin and other stuff onto, for starters, Wagner Blinding, using, for starters, Ben Laurie?s lucre code. I haven?t seen a code-stoke like the one I see Chris with, well, since the old days. Which is nice. Very nice. Big grins all around, down here in the elbow of the Caribbean. Apparently, like me, he noticed that he was delivering instantly-usable product now, and getting paid later, too much later usually. I discovered cypherpunks in late spring of 1994 looking for a solution to something Barnes (again) called the ?latency? problem. Chriss bumped into the gold-silver-crypto list, I think, about 10 years later.
Mr. Odom has been been kind enough to involve me in testing OT a bit, and, ultimately, I?ve more-or-less bailed on iterative break-it-and-fix-it. Mostly because I don?t have the patience for testing ? much less writing ? code, if I ever really did. But here?s the rub, I also I have no *idea* what I, personally, would do with Open Transactions these days even if I could get it running in production.
I have lots of ideas in *general*, you understand, but they?re mostly of the ?let?s you and him fight? variety. Many more people than *I* would have to be involved, they, and I, would risk much more than money, and, ultimately, I?m not sure any of it would work. It?s a drag to think that most of what I?m interested in doing requires the dissolution, or at least dissipation, of The World?s Only Remaining Superpower to happen. As someone who still, barely, calls himself mostly an anarcho-capitalist but still a patriot, that?s about the only thing worse than only being interesting to other people during the top of a bubble. Yup. A Mass of Contradictions, as usual.
"Let?s you and him fight" is only two or three steps removed from Mr. Briceno?s original observation, I figure.
Hell, even ?set here next to the rockin' chair, sonny, and I?ll tell ya a story?, is, ultimately, not much more help than ?get off my lawn?, when you get right down to it...

Bitcoin is a digital currency which relies on a distributed set of miners to mint coins and on a peer-to-peer network to broadcast transactions. The identities of Bitcoin users are hidden behind pseudonyms (public keys) which are rec- ommended to be changed frequently in order to increase transaction unlinkability.
We present an efficient method to deanonymize Bitcoin users, which allows to link user pseudonyms to the IP ad- dresses where the transactions are generated. Our tech- niques work for the most common and the most challenging scenario when users are behind NATs or firewalls of their ISPs. They allow to link transactions of a user behind a NAT and to distinguish connections and transactions of different users behind the same NAT. We also show that a natural countermeasure of using Tor or other anonymity services can be cut-off by abusing anti-DoS countermeasures of the Bit- coin network. Our attacks require only a few machines and have been experimentally verified. The estimated success rate is between 11% and 60% depending on how stealthy an attacker wants to be. We propose several countermeasures to mitigate these new attacks.

Holography is destiny, boys and girls. And behavior, particularly on Facebook, is holography.
Pull the other leg, Zuck. It has bells on it.
Facebook's reportedly working on a mobile app for anonymity
Social media giant Facebook drew ire from some users recently due to its strict real name policy. Some even fled for Ello -- madness!
Now, it looks like Facebook's responding to complaints with a mobile app "that allows users to interact inside of it without having to use their real names." That's according to two people speaking with The New York Times, anyway; the sources also said the app is set to launch "in the coming weeks."
Facebook's long held policies requiring verified email addresses, originally requiring college-specific email address logins per its collegiate origins. Those policies clashed recently with drag queens, some of whom had their profiles outright removed from Facebook (by algorithms). It's not clear how this app would affect web-based Facebook use, if at all, and Facebook's not saying a peep thus far. A Facebook rep told Engadget, "We don't comment on rumor or speculation."
Facebook is also widely criticized for its use of user information. When Facebook made its Messenger app standalone and required more access to users' information, many swore off the service as a result. Which is to say nothing of criticisms about user privacy; see our privacy how-to from way back in 2010 for evidence of how long this has been a user concern.
Issues have repeatedly arisen around Facebook changing its Terms of Service. CEO Mark Zuckerberg even had to face Federal courts regarding user concerns. At the time, he admitted mistakes were made in Facebook's past. Zuckerberg and co. certainly aren't against addressing user concerns, and they've been meeting with members of the LGBTQ community to address the recent issues with real names. We'll have to wait and see if this is a reaction to that, or something else altogether.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Obituary: Hal Finney | The Economist 
Hal Finney
AS IT turned out, Hal Finney was not Satoshi Nakamoto. But for a short while, at least, some people thought he might be. ?Satoshi Nakamoto? is the most famous non-person on the internet. The name is a pseudonym, meant to hide the shadowy programmer (or programmers) behind Bitcoin, a computerised currency designed to liberate money from the control of any central bank. Speculating about his true identity is a popular pastime in some of the more esoteric corners of the web.
Still, Mr Finney was a good guess. As a cryptographer and a programmer he had the skills, for Bitcoin relies on cryptography to function. Having been an early adopter (he was, with the fabled Mr Nakamoto, a partner in the world?s first ever Bitcoin transaction) he certainly had the pedigree. And he had the beliefs, too. He was one of the original ?cypherpunks?, a small, influential band of cryptographers, philosophers and programmers who, in the early 1990s, helped stamp the early internet with its culture of rebelliousness, distrust of government and optimistic belief in the liberating power of technology.
Two decades before Edward Snowden put the subject on front pages the world over, the cypherpunks were discussing how the coming age of the internet would allow governments and companies to pry ever more deeply and easily into the lives of their citizens and customers. But that same computer revolution would also hand ordinary people the power to fight back against the organisations that presumed to run their lives. Until that point, good quality encryption had been something available only to spy agencies and big companies. Computers would give people the power to carve out a mathematically guaranteed refuge from the powers that be, and to have a conversation that was provably, reliably private.
For Mr Finney, who had spent his high-school years imbibing the supercharged libertarianism of Ayn Rand, and who was now earning a living writing video games, that was a heady challenge. He accepted it with gusto. ?Here we are faced with the problems of loss of privacy, creeping computerisation, massive databases, more centralisation,? he wrote. ?[But] the computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them.? His aim was clear: ?The work we are doing here, broadly speaking, is dedicated to this goal of making Big Brother obsolete.?
He began helping, unpaid, with a program called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), putting in enough hours that it became a second job. It was well-named: even today, messages scrambled with it are thought to be unbreakable (Mr Snowden used PGP for his e-mail exchanges with the journalists to whom he leaked his documents). In 1991 Phil Zimmermann, PGP?s chief developer, uploaded it to the internet. America?s spies were aghast. Exporting encryption?which was classed as a weapon?was illegal. And here a group of self-proclaimed techno-liberators were proposing to just hand it over to anyone in the world?diplomat, criminal, teenager?who wanted it. When the legal kerfuffle died down, Mr Zimmermann hired Mr Finney as his new company?s second-ever employee.
Suspended animation
For a long time he ran a free ?remailer?, a server designed to forward e-mail anonymously, no questions asked, to anyone in the world. Whose business was it, after all, what people wanted to send to each other, except the sender and the recipient? His interests extended beyond privacy. He was fascinated by the sorts of futures that technology might unlock, speculating about everything from how morals evolve in rich societies to when clean energy might finally displace fossil fuels. Away from the screen, he was chatty and gregarious, a keen skier and runner.
He had to stop in 2009, when he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND). The illness gradually paralyses its victims, but, with characteristic logic, Mr Finney pointed out that it was not a death sentence?even when those muscles necessary for breathing gave out, life could carry on with the aid of a mechanical ventilator. He was surprised, he said, to discover that most people with the disease ?chose? death instead. After all, MND robs sufferers only of their bodies, not their minds, and for him it was the mind that mattered. His interests went beyond computers and coding, to sociology, psychology and how technology might improve society. As long as there was a way to communicate with the outside world?even if it was only by having a computer interpret the twitchings of a facial muscle?he wanted to endure.
When even that became difficult, he put a final plan into action. In accordance with his wishes, he was disconnected from his ventilator. As soon as he had been declared legally dead, technicians from a firm called Alcor froze his body in liquid nitrogen. He became one of a few hundred people who have elected to have their bodies stored until medicine advances to the point where it can safely revive them and cure their original ailments. It sounds (and is) science-fictional, and Mr Finney was under no illusions about the prospects of waking up again. But placing his faith in a technology that has yet to be invented was a rational gamble for a committed techno-optimist. And besides, a slim hope is better than none at all.

At IBUC in 2000 or so we were working with CRESTCo, operators of CREST, a database mirror of all the custodial bank positions in the UK, which functions as the securities clearinghouse for the UK and Ireland. In the same way that the Depository Trust Company works for the NYSE. Spinoff of the Bank of England.
We wanted to issue Chaumian (or other) blind signature bearer certificates representing any security on the CREST system, including the S&P 500, collateralized by a custodial account in the UK on CREST. A customer would withdraw their securities and transfer them to out custodial account, we would issue them a bearer certificate on the net. When someone deposited a certificate with us, we would transfer them shares to their custodial account through CREST. To make this operate, IBUC would have to be the material owner of those bonds and shares. IBUC would be able to *lend* that debt and equity to short sellers in addition to collecting a premium at issue and redeeming at par. Pretty much the way that American Express is when the get cash. Itâs their money until you said it was yours by depositing a travellerâs check. :-)
Nobody over there, including the legal counsel who did the work to create CREST itself, batted an eye. CRESTCo paid us consulting fees to help figure this out. It was a good time to be alive.
Then the dot-bomb went off, and we were dead. Then 9/11 happened, and they dug us out of the hole, drove a stake through our hearts, set us on fire, and sent the ashes into the sun.
The blockchain is just CREST For Everything In The Sky. When the white paper was posted here, I looked at it and thought, meh, book-entry. Thought the same about PayPal too. :-)
You *could* collateralize blind-signature bearer certificates with the block-chain, But That Would Be Wrong.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Fun and games with international transaction 
The way interbank clearing and settlement evolved is by the exchange first of pieces of clay and paper promising money to each other, and then having accounts on each other?s books, the balances of which changed after authenticated messages were themselves exchanged. Then financial entities kept accounts at a third party, a clearinghouse, to make settlement between all parties in a market net out faster. Today those clearinghouses for currency usually are called "central banks". Hence the ?central? part, oddly enough. For securities that happen at, oddly enough, clearinghouses. Sensible, those capital markets operations types are. When I was paying attention this stuff, the New York Stock Exchange cleared at The Depository Trust Company. Before London?s Big Bang, custodial banks cleared their LSE-traded securities against each other without a clearing house. Then they built an obscurely-named database mirror called ?CREST?, and set up a company, sensibly called ?CRESTCo?, to run it. IBUC, a company I founded, did stuff with CRESTCo for a while. We wanted to hook up a Chaumian blind-signature to CREST and issue certificates on the net backed up by securities held in a custodial account in London. They paid us to help figure out if it was possible. Yes it is. Or was, before 9/11. Interest, such as it is, is now disclosed.
To continue the example, then. I send you, a fellow trusted financial entity (for various values of trust, financial, and entity) a piece of paper (or clay, in the cuneiform days?) which you believe to be true, to hand some asset (grain, gold, cows?) to somebody else with the promise that I?d pay you back. You take the okay, clay, and give the person offering you those same assets, as promised. At some point, you and I settle up, or, more likely, you just pass it on in exchange for something else of equal value discovered in a price-clearing auction of some kind, agreeable to both parties, maybe that person will come back to me, or someone they?ve traded with will. Note that there is no interest in this transaction. Okay, there?s a spread, taken off the top, but the actual claim on the traded document is perpetual unless stated otherwise. It is, in financial terms, a zero-coupon (interest) perpetuity.
Oddly enough, that?s what fiat currency is. It makes financial professors laugh in recognition, but that?s what ?money? is. If I hand it to you, and you hand it to somebody else, and, some body eventually hands it back to me, I have to pay up, or all of the *other* pieces of clay, or paper, or base metal, or bits, become worthless. See ?trust? above. It isn?t the asset that matters. It?s the fact of it?s exchange that matters. Like the old joke about a can of beans, those beans are for *selling*, not for eating.
At *exactly* the same time people started writing financial messages and trading them around like they were real stuff, people had actually invented writing to keep track of that very stuff. Usually in lists, oddly enough. Registers, say. Even though ?bank? means bench (?bancos?, where the Venetians traded currency), banks have more often than not been people who kept people?s stuff and issued them either paper, or coins, or clay, representing other people?s claim on that stuff ? oh, grain, say ? or just kept lists, which those people, or others with their permission, could claim later. This usually happened at a premium for traded tokens, or a discount, if they just moved money around on the books of a bank. That second bit is because banks, by modern definition, at least, are people who lend out more than they are technically responsible for paying back. Rothbard, and the usual Real Libertarians out there, thought this stuff, fractional reserves, was Evil, but it seems to work, so we keep it. Problem is that bankers have socialized their collection process, in exchange for, shall we say, a contingent claim on that bank?s revenue and assets by local force monopolists. That?s called ?debasing the currency? in most quarters, particularly if said force monopolist is responsible for defining what that currency actually *is*.
So, now along comes financial cryptography. We have a class of financial cryptography protocols that mimic moving those tokens around. Chaumian blind signatures being the Big Bang of Financial Cryptography for just this reason; and Bitcoin, which amounts to registered unforgeable certificates with a distributed, and also unforgeable, certificate registry. Lots of people have messed with book-entry financial cryptography, by the way, from Eric Hughes? ?encrypted open books?, to Wayner?s translucent database stuff, but, in general, just shoving encrypted instructions over a public internetwork to execute, clear, and settle a given transaction between my financial entity, your financial entity, and some third party clearinghouse ? SSL, in other words ? seems to be good enough for book-entry transactions right now. The big bang for *that* stuff was probably the telegraph, and certainly the hollerith card. Probably not much more to wring out of book-entry settlement that won?t also happen elsewhere at the same time.
Right now, Nakamotoan (heh...) registered digital certificates are *threatening* to be three orders of magnitude cheaper than SSL-encrypted financial instructions to internet-fronted financial entities wired into proprietary networks on the back-end. They?re certainly cheaper than remittance networks, which is all that remains of legacy telegraph operator Western Union, for instance. I like three orders of magnitude (cypherpunk eyes roll everywhere) because it?s a big scary number, and nothing else. It?s a placeholder for real data to be used later to determine the boundary layer between the adoption of one financial settlement technology and another. Implicit in that claim is that book-entry settlement (my bank, your bank, and a clearinghouse swapping debits and credits) was cheaper than Walter Wriston?s Singapore At 3PM, where couriers, armed and otherwise, walked physical paper bonds and bearer shares between buildings on the same block to literal cages in each other?s offices all at once. I used to work in one of the last of those cages, BTW, in Chicago, when I was a, um, punk, myself. :-) I also lived in a hole. In the road. And had to fill it in the morning. But that?s a Yorkshireman story for another time.
So, can finance use the blockchain, that distributed certificate register of, um, registered certificates, for something else? The Etherium guys think so. One of them was up on Dave Birch?s podcast a few months ago talking about something that would make Hernando de Soto (no, not that one, the newer one?) get a big case of the weepy glees: an unimpeachable distributed registry of land titles. Which would be Really Fucking Cool. (An actual term of financial operations art, that, here?s hoping it passes the censor?s muster here?)
Certainly, modulo whatever problems they may or may not have in delivering code, the Etherium guy has the financial elephant by the proper set of protuberances. In my former professional opinion as a former clerk in a cage. Among other things.
Couple those unimpeachable registries of title to other things, like, oh, all physical assets either before or after manufacturing, or in transit, or in storage, or on a retail shelf, and you can turn right around and create an *index* of those assets. Strangely enough, you can then turn around and calculate a *price* for that index, which, oddly enough, is what a central bank purports to do when they claim they?re ?controlling inflation?. Modulo socializing other ?externalities? (Hayek?s "last refuge of the dirigistes?) like ?employment?, whatever that is, or monetizing national debts into quantitatively-eased phlogiston, or ether, or whatever Special Sauce they call it this week. Okay, so prices aren?t actually calculated, they?re discovered, but accumulating those discovered prices into an index gets you? well, you get the idea.
Some Idiot :-) talked about this nonsense, among other things, in various venues, public and private, fifteen years ago or so, taking Gene Fama?s and Fisher Black?s name in vain in the process. Essentially you can trade that index for other assets *as if* it was a fiat currency, using ? these days, time flies ? a blockchain as a clearinghouse, and the index as the stated value. These indices would be competitive, being thought up by Various Bright People Like Yourselves Here, Only Financial Ones, and anyone could use an index to issue, heh, zero-coupon perpetuities, denominated in assets contained in that index. Mass hysteria. Cats and Dogs living together. Somebody else here, *cough*, talked about ?Gold-Denominated Burmese Opium Futures? once, in a ballroom long ago and far away. From me. Now, anyway. Kinda like that, only weirder.
This *kind* of thing, I believe, is what IBM is on about here, I think. Mostly the subsidiary bits, not the ?and then you create a currency without the state, maaan? bit. Because That Would Be Just Crazy, If Not Actually Morally Wrong, okay?
In surfing, I believe they call kind of euphoria a ?stoke?.
Sounds vaguely familiar to everybody here, I?m sure. Particularly the part where you have to pry some enthusiast or other off your leg before they get *too* excited?

Popped up in a standing google trawl I have out for “blind signature”. First one that’s hit in years.
Electronic currency revived after 20-year hiatus
Talk to any central banker about the future of currencies and they will agree that we are heading towards a world of electronic money.
Nobody is quite sure when it will happen or exactly what digital currencies will look like. But there is a growing realisation that the ideal solution will not involve a debit and credit in some ledger in cyberspace.
In other words, the utopian world of electronic currencies is unlikely to involve the technology behind Bitcoin, called Blockchain.
That brings us to the launch, or should that be relaunch, of digi.cash by an Australian company funded by Capital Markets Co-operative Research Centre.
This is an electronic currency in the truest sense of the term. The money is in the form of bytes of data which can be transferred electronically. Initially it is only available in Australian dollars.
The ownership of the currency is not determined by an account balance held in a ledger somewhere.
The technology behind digi.cash is an extension of the cryptographic protocols developed by American tech entrepreneur David Chaum in the 1980s.
Chaum launched the world's first crypto-currency in the 1990s but it failed miserably. Like so many tech inventions it was ahead of its time. In the 1990s when it hit the market, total e-commerce was estimated at about $1 million.
When his crypto-currency failed to gain traction, Chaum turned his attention to a range of other ground-breaking projects including an encrypted messaging system.
Twenty years later digi.cash has a new lease of life with the backing of a group of engineers and scientists in Sydney led by Andreas Furche. The backers include one of the co-leaders of the Australian team that invented Wi-Fi, Dave Skellern, and former Westpac Banking Corp executive Peter Clare.
It works this way: the electronic version of the currency is digitally minted as electronically signed coins and banknotes. These can be held on a smartphone, computers or storage devices.
The money can be transferred between online users. The encryption technology means that the electronic banknotes can circulate securely without the risk of theft or counterfeiting.
Furche says the cryptography allows the payer of a transaction to remain untraceable. The currency is created and transferred as 500 byte long RSA blind signature tokens, which allow the payer in a transaction to remain untraceable. RSA refers to the three men who invented the first global public key cryptography, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adleman.
Chaum extended the work done by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman with the addition of a blind signature protocol which is part of digi.cash.
The digital currency is operating under an exemption from the Reserve Bank of Australia which limits total funds on issue to $10 million.

Iâm pretty much of the opinion that micropayments are for machines. Starting with âdust accumulatorsâ developing the proper financial capacitance to execute a human-mediated transaction and ending, ultimately â in my feeble imagination at least â in routers auctioning bandwidth to each other, cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria, &cet.
Of course, I also think that machines can do price discovery in the first place.
Which makes for interesting discussions. Financial people, especially the kind whose machines, um, do price discovery, say âSo? What else is new?â Economists (and other political types) look at me like Iâm from Mars, sadly some of them my pretty-much-Rothbardian ostensible-fellow-travelers, who fairly worship Human Action, using the proper Misean capitalization. Not surprisingly, J. Random Cypherpunk believes this as well. Or did, anyway. Uphill. Both ways. In the snow. Thatâs okay. Once The Right Economists figure out that machines are *discovering* prices instead of âcalculatingâ them, theyâll sidle back up to me over here on the Group W bench and stop giving me the hairy eyeballâ¦ Itâs not an unfamiliar feeling for me anyway. I suppose you can get used to anything if it happens enough.
Rodney Thayer, channeling Schopenhauer, or Gandhi, or somebody, used to say here, or maybe elsewhere, that if theyâre yelling, youâre right. If they nod sagely, you havenât said anything at all. Depends on who youâre talking to, doesnât it? And whether they matter anymore. Finance people tend to write code, and economists tend to write law. Weâre still sitting here, and elsewhere, trying to figure whoâll win that fight and itâs been more than 20 years now.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Chaum Has a Plan to End the Crypto War 
Remember that finance has always been cryptographic. Authentication is very important. Seals on bullae representing assets for trade go all the way back to the Sumerians in the 8th century BC. Chops and sigils and seals required to authenticate transactions are older. Writing was invented to count. Book-entry transactions are as old as writing.
I believe the proper term of financial cryptographic art is airy-fairy statist happy horseshit. :-) Okay. The cryptography works. Until the rubber hoses come out. Somewhere Thomas Sowell is laughing at William Godwin again…
They sure do, don’t they?
Yup. There's an echo in here…
One has to forgive quasi-state-funded academics their quasi-statism. The paradox of modern financial cryptography is that it was invented by leftist academics to prevent businesses from knowing who we were doing business with.
It was discovered by Rothbardian anarchocapitalists as a panacea against totalizing statism, then it was evangelized, *cough*, by (now-not-so-)Hamiltonian conservatives as a way to dramatically collapse transaction costs and achieve Freedom Through World Trade.
Fortunately, as bad as it looks, The Future is not only unevenly distributed, but it’s also very much Out Of Control, Kevin, which is what we all wanted. Mostly.
I personally think Chaum’s pissing in the wind, here.
It’s like me thinking I could walk Chaumian protocols into the front door of the financial system on transaction costs alone, surfing the dot-com bubble right into the brick wall of 9/11.
I watched the actual End of The Happy Cypherpunk Future, oddly enough, in Cayman at FC00. People spent a two hour pre-lunch session and most of the allotted lunch hour trying to desperately pound the Undo button on Bush’s election. I noted at the time, after standing second in line behind Jean Camp and her mean rock-throwing left arm, that cryptography allowed us to be anonymous only if we could sell our votes, and that in finance, that was called “equity”, which didn’t go down too well.
The gravity of The Forward March Into The Free (as in speech) Cypherpunk Future lessened somehow, degenerate rent-seeking electron pressure reasserted itself, and we all became Republicans and Democrats again. Maybe we never were anything else after all. It was good while it lasted, but maybe it’s not over, even now.
Notice that book-entry settlement and bearer transactions are as old as writing itself. Trading cryptographically unique tokens *caused* writing, which was invented for accounting. Nothing ever goes away.

@_subject: [Cryptography] GNU's "anonymous-but-taxable electronic payments 
The Register
GNU cryptocurrency aims at 'the mainstream economy not the black market'
GNU and an outfit called “Inria” have released Alpha code – version 0.0.0 to be precise – of an anonymous-but-taxable electronic payments system they say is “a currency for the mainstream economy, and not the black market.”
“Taler”, as the effort is dubbed, looks to be an attempt to build on the concepts behind Bitcoin. So while Taler lets you use encrypted “coins” as a means of exchange, it is explicitly not a new currency. Instead, it “... uses an electronic exchange holding financial reserves in existing currencies.”
“This means that Taler is not a new currency with the inherent currency fluctuation risks, but instead the cryptographic coins correspond to existing currencies, such as US Dollars, Euros or even BitCoins.”
The technology is also designed to be open enough that governments can peer inside, levy “sales, value-added or income taxes”.
As a GNU project, the code is of course freely-available.
For now, the effort is in its very early stages. GNU even warns, in the announcement of the project's debut, that “There is no auditor, and hence components do not properly support auditors either. As a result, a dishonest exchange could embezzle funds.” There's also no real-world integration at present, “so only toy currencies are available for now.”
If you're interested regardless of those foibles, the 0.0.0 code does include “key components providing logic for running a bank, exchange, merchant and wallet.” That code is described as follows:
Inria and GNU hope to have more advanced versions of Taler to share by year's end.
When they do, it may well be game on in the cryptocurrency space: Taler's already used fighting words with its “mainstream, not black market” talk. Bitcoin's many admirers may take offence at that kind of language and point to strong adoption. Sceptics can point to security woes among Bitcoin exchanges, governance woes and the cryptocurrency's volatility as evidence that different approaches to electronic currencies probably won't hurt their evolution. ®

@_subject: [Cryptography] GNU's "anonymous-but-taxable electronic payments 
So. A few observations and maybe a question or two. When we were talking to CRESTCo., circa 1999/2001 (CRESTCo owns(ed?) CREST, which is/was? a database mirror of all the custodial positions in the UK and Ireland, Bob is Old, and Technically Retired, and hasn’t been paying attention for a very long time, if ever) we figured that it would be trivial to pay stamp duty on securities transactions as they went through clearing, we just couldn’t say, with any precision :-), *who* was paying the duty. Our plan, before the dot-bomb finally blew us up in July 2001, and then 9/11 made the rubble bounce, was to hook a mint up to CREST, take delivery as the beneficial owner of the securities in question there, including depository receipts for the S&P, which would have been interesting, and issue, say, Chaumian (or Wagner, as Chaum was, um, entailed…) blind-signature digital bearer certificates representing a claim on those securities when the holder wanted to take possession of them, delivered via CREST to a custodial account of their own somewhere. Sticking a nonce or something out of band was probably how we were going to know how to match certificate deposits/withdrawals with certificates.
More-or-less instantaneous T-0 intra-day settlements among a “club” (HT Eric Hughes) of known large institutions was one of the possible ways to bootstrap this, and moving to retail after things shook out a bit and people and lawyers stopped yelling at each other. So, people transferred securities in their possession to an underwriter like IBUC was going to be, or an OBUC (Other Bearer Underwriting Company) :-) competing with IBUC, the underwriter would issue them a certificate on the net, and, when the ultimate holder of the certificate was ready to take it off the net and convert the claim to an actual CREST position.   Certainly the only sure-fire way to prevent double spending of Chaumian blind-signature digital bearer certificates is to redeem and reissue them at each transaction, obviously sans dealing with the custodial stuff that one would with a deposit/withdrawal. At each redeem-reissue, a stamp duty to the powers that be could then be paid. In cash. Settled instantaneously. Bob’s — or Sam’s — your, um, uncle. :-)
Strangely, after 9/11, GWOT, KYC and all the other fun stuff that has happened, nobody really wants to talk about technically anonymous bearer-settled transactions on the net, even if they might be almost instantaneous and three orders of magnitude cheaper than book-entry settlement. It certainly looks like it’s illegal now, and it was going to cost a couple of million pounds in legal fees to figure it out even when it looked legal then. We were talking to the lawyer who did the work setting up CREST, dematerializing physical shares, and making the database mirror like CREST the legal equivalent of a clearinghouse like DTC in the US. It was doable. Probably not now. So far. :-)
After Bitcoin, people might be more receptive to the idea, but again, if it’s cheaper. A lot cheaper. The fun bit about bitcoin was, of course, look ma, no lawyers. For a while. Solved all kinds of problems, it did.
However, I still think the idea of m-of-n where m=n=2 is a good idea. It’s the kind of backstop that financial people like to know they have if they need it. (ObBelt-Onion: When I was the most junior clerk possible at Morgan’s Chicago office in the early 80’s we were doing this very glamorous thing of transmitting the contents of an 8-inch IBM floppy, containing the results of a couple of hours’ keypunching (by, heh, me) every night to New York using an always-nailed-up telephone circuit with a couple of 300bps modems on either end.  We also kept paper copies of the transmission, and of course all the paper I read when punching the stuff in. And we stored two weeks of office trash in case we threw something out. By the way, you can’t say “belt and suspenders” in the UK without getting at least a titter, and even the odd shocked glance, by the way, a warning to Americans traveling abroad…)
Anyway, just popping out the key that double-spent the certificate and bouncing it, and  the trade itself, back to the redeemer before it even clears or settles was a nifty piece of kit to my mind. Keeping a list of *redeemed* certificates only, because the *issued* certificate copies were blinded and thus literally meaningless, was also pretty slick, besides keeping the costs down considerably, which was always my focus in these things. Bitcoin needing to keep *all* transactions *forever* (for various values of ever) always struck me as lumpy, but it works, and Moore’s Law is our friend so far. The *other* feature to me back then with m-of-n , keeping only *redeemed* certificates, and changing issuing keys in epochs driven probably by redeemed value of the collateral pool, instead of time (HT Ian Goldberg), the Coaseian transaction cost would be driven increasingly lower, and thus the cost of being an *underwriter* could keep falling over time. I joked in Wired in 1996 or so about a syndicate of bots underwriting a bond issue for your lunch. Instead of a many-to-one relationship between borrower to creditor in a credit-card transaction would be inverted. Cats and dogs living together. Mass hysteria. &cet.
So, now a question. Can Thaler work in such a model? Could it just be hooked up, modulo the odd twiddle and the approval of your friendly local force monopoly, to somebody like CREST, or DTC?

Quantum cryptography for book entry transaction settlement?
Multi-photon entanglement in high dimensions
Nature Photonics (2016) doi:10.1038/nphoton.2016.12
Received 20 October 2015 Accepted 19 January 2016 Published online 29 February 2016
Forming the backbone of quantum technologies today, entanglement1, 2 has been demonstrated in physical systems as diverse as photons3, ions4 and superconducting circuits5. Although steadily pushing the boundary of the number of particles entangled, these experiments have remained in a two-dimensional space for each particle. Here we show the experimental generation of the first multi-photon entangled state where both the number of particles and dimensions are greater than two. Two photons in our state reside in a three-dimensional space, whereas the third lives in two dimensions. This asymmetric entanglement structure6 only appears in multiparticle entangled states with d > 26. Our method relies on combining two pairs of photons, high-dimensionally entangled in their orbital angular momentum7. In addition, we show how this state enables a new type of ‘layered’ quantum communication protocol. Entangled states such as these serve as a manifestation of the complex dance of correlations that can exist within quantum mechanics.

@_subject: [Cryptography] The threat of privacy 
The Threat of Privacy By Charles M. Kahn1
Like artists, we academics want to believe that if one of our works doesn?t get enough attention it?s because we?re ahead of our time. I?d like to pretend that everything I?ve written is pathbreaking, and will eventually be recognized for its true importance. But I have to admit that there are really only a couple of cases where I can say with hindsight that something I wrote has been ahead of its time.
One of them2 is a paper written with Jamie McAndrews and Will Roberds, published in 2005, and titled ?Money is Privacy.? We wrote it partly as a response to Narayana Kocherlakota?s famous paper ?Money is Memory,? which could be taken as arguing that cash is essentially a record?keeping device, tracking who was a net creditor and who a net debtor to society with respect to resources provided or consumed. The implication was that if it became easy to keep credit records directly, cash could wither away.
In our paper we argued instead that a key role of cash was its ability to protect the purchaser?s identity. So we predicted that, even while the reductions in costs of record keeping and increases in the speed of data transmission were expanding the usage of credit? and deposit?account? based payments arrangements, cash would survive. Because the desire for privacy would always generate demand for cash, it would be a mistake?and ultimately futile?to attempt to abolish it. At the time, people were attuned to many of the problems of privacy, but there had not yet been a clear recognized link between the value of privacy and the role of payments systems. (Remember, bitcoin was only released in 2009).

CRESTCo is/was?(Bod is Old, CRESTCo got sold...) the equivalent of DTC for the UK and Ireland. We (IBUC) were working out with them how to hook a Chaumian mint into CREST, their database mirror of all the UK custodial bank positions. This was from July 2000 to 2001 or so.
It?s pretty simple really. Anybody could do it. We were talking to Clifford Chance, and they told us it would cost what it cost to set up CREST in regulatory dosh. About 10 million pounds (Y2K) in legal fees to re-iterate what they did when they set up CREST.
After that, set up a depository account. People transfer you assets, you become the material owner of those assets, issue blind signature notes for a fee representing a claim on those assets. The underwriter of the blind signature note gets to loan those assets for short-selling, etc., just like a bank does with cash, redeem/reissue of certificates for transfer would be free, conversion from book-entry to bearer form would be charged charged a fee. Little to no conversion fee to move an asset from the custodian to bearer certificate form. Pretty much like traveller?s checks, except for the redeem/reissue part.
If they?re thinking about doing this with a blockchain, though, I can?t see how much cheaper than an existing custodial relationship it would be for an institutional customer. Three orders of magnitude, etc. Underwriter keeps a copy of spent (redeemed) certificates just like the protocol says. MofN=2 gets you double-spenders, and no redemption. Stuff we all know here.
The dot-bomb kinda killed it, and 9/11 made the rubble bounce. Smoot-Hawley, and then KYC.
Anyway, the closer you get to T-0, the closer you get to bearer. It was ever thus. And ?blockchain? is book-entry, not ?tokens?, much less ?bearer?.

You should have read further on. Absolutely nowhere. It never even became a project. :-) TLDR: Dot-bomb. (No more money.

(No more new money, forever, for anything like anonymity.) Declan McCullough even wrote an article in Wired making me look for all the world like the Feral Kid in Mad Max shortly before 9/11. Not too far from the truth, in hindsight. :-) Oh. And Bitcoin. Which proved that you can do a cash-equivalent commodity, at least, Perry once called it an ?electrical potlatch?, but one without proof of stake, which is useful for, you know, finance. :-)
It didn?t need to be. Most finance is done on the ?fiefdom" model. A securities underwriting, for instance, ain?t called a ?syndicate? for nothin?. Bearer transactions, digital otherwise, are done between a buyer, a seller, and an underwriter, explicitly in digital form, and implicitly in paper. A wire transfer doesn?t require a central bank at all, as long as the banks involved have an account in each other. You change a number on your books and I?ll change an offsetting number on mine. The creation of a clearinghouse allows strangers to change numbers on a third party?s books, and even then you just need a bank in common. CREST was just a database mirror of all the custodial banks in the UK and Ireland, remember.
As for blind signature notes as bearer certificates, maybe even someday, but it could be that David Chaum was Otto Lilienthal and not the Wright Brothers.
The patents, by the way, ended up at whatsitsname ? Bob is Old and so is this story -- the giant card services processor, after changing hands several times. I liken it to the last scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark, with the blind signature patent being trundled off into the anonymous distance of a large underground storage facility. Except that in 2003 the patent went ?poof?, and hey, presto, nothing happened anyway. See KYC, etc., above.
The whole thing was a bet that, if it worked, all this perfectly pseudonymous Crypto-Anarchy stuff would be cheaper than book entry settlement by three orders of magnitude. Hasn?t proven to be so. And bitcoin, um, lowered the bar quite a bit, at least for cash-equivalent commodities. Tim May called it the greatest innovation since double entry bookkeeping, or something...

@_subject: [Cryptography] An Identity-Based Blind Signature Scheme Using 
An Identity-Based Blind Signature Scheme Using Lattice with Provable Security
With the rapid development of quantum computing and quantum information technology, the universal quantum computer will emerge in the near decades with a very high probability and it could break most of the current public key cryptosystems totally. Due to the ability of withstanding the universal quantum computer?s attack, the lattice-based cryptosystems have received lots of attention from both industry and academia. In this paper, we propose an identity-based blind signature scheme using lattice. We also prove that the proposed scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model. The performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme has less mean value of sampling times and smaller signature size than previous schemes. Thus, the proposed scheme is more suitable for practical applications.
1. Introduction
Currently, the emergence of quantum computing causes a potential threat to the traditional cryptosystems. In 2011, the first commercial quantum computer ?D-Wave One? was worked out, which provided the application of certain cracking algorithms to the traditional public key cryptography with feasible condition. Furthermore, it is because most of mathematical hard problems in the traditional cryptosystems are vulnerable to the strong computing power of quantum computers. Therefore, it is obvious that the influence quantum computers bring to the traditional cryptosystem will permeate into the information security and Internet security of all areas of a country, such as politics, economy, culture, and military.
Specifically, it can be explained from two main aspects: Firstly, for the integer factorization problem, the conjecture that an -bit integer can be decomposed by the -qubit quantum computer easily is proposed by Beauregard [1]. As for the discrete logarithm problem, Proos and Zalka [2] pointed out that -bits elliptic curve discrete logarithmic problem [3, 4] can be solved by -qubit quantum computer. Secondly, the valid length of the secret key in traditional cryptosystem will be half of the original length under the attack of quantum adversary.
Blind signature was first proposed by Chaum [5] to make electronic money in an electronic cash system. In general, the user can get a valid signature of any message through a blind signature scheme, where the signer knows nothing about the actual message. This special property makes the blind signature used widely. Therefore, a plenty of blind schemes were worked out after the work of Chaum, such as [6, 7]. However, those schemes had the significant problem on certificates, which is the core problem in public key infrastructure (PKI) cryptosystem. In 1984, the identity-based (ID-based) public key cryptosystem was worked out by Shamir [8], which is useful to eliminate the serious defect of the PKI cryptosystem. Since then, lots of ID-based blind signature schemes were proposed with efficient performance.
As is known to all, most of the above blind signature schemes cannot resist the attack of quantum algorithms. It is because the computational power of the quantum computers is so strong that the hard problems in those schemes are easy to be broken. In order to remove this threat, the postquantum cryptography appears in the vision of cryptographers, which is that the traditional cryptosystem still holds its security under the attack of the quantum adversary. In the postquantum cryptography systems, the lattice-based cryptography is the most promising. Currently, lots of cryptographic protocols have been devised on the lattice, such as [9?11].
There are several advantages of the lattice-based cryptography which are worth noting. Firstly, this cryptosystem has got widespread attention in the last decade. Then, this cryptography currently cannot be broken by any algorithms, including quantum algorithms. Moreover, lattice-based cryptography has the same level of security in the average case and the worst case. Finally, the designs of lattice-based schemes are very simple and efficient, including mainly matrix-vector multiplication, linear summation operation, and modulo operation.
Taking advantage of these benefits, some blind signature schemes were designed, but several problems included in these schemes make them inapplicable in the real environment. For example, some blind signature schemes lack the formal security proof or describe the ability of the adversary incorrectly. Besides, the efficiency shortcomings in other schemes are too serious to be neglected, such as the scheme proposed by R?ckert [12] and the work of Zhang et al. [13]. The main reason for this is that complex algorithms are used in the process of signing or the efficient aborting technology is not involved in these blind signature schemes.
In order to improve the practicability of blind signature, a new ID-based scheme on lattice is proposed in this paper, which is more efficient and secure. Specifically, the main contributions of this paper are as follows:(1)Firstly, our blind signature scheme can resist the attack of the malicious quantum adversaries, because it is based on lattice. Meanwhile, we prove that our scheme is secure based on SIS problem in the random oracle model. The lattice cryptosystem also makes it more efficient due to the simple operations involved in lattice-based algorithms.(2)Secondly, we use the bimodal Gaussian rejection sampling in our scheme to prevent the leakage of critical information, such as the signer?s secret key. Using this aborting technology, it makes the mean value of sampling times needed to generate a valid signature smaller. Additionally, we can get the blind signature with smaller size under this novel technology.(3)Finally, because the framework of ID-based cryptosystem is used in our scheme, it means that the additional cost is not needed to manage lots of certificates in our scheme. Therefore, the proposed scheme under this cryptosystem is more practical in the real application.
2. Related Work
In this section, we will mainly talk about the related works on the blind signature schemes. Due to its excellent concealment, blind signature has been studied widely and put into the applications where important data needs to hold its privacy, such as electronic cash (e-cash) [14], electronic voting [15], and oblivious transfer [16].
In order to design electronic money used in the e-cash system, Chaum [5] proposed the first blind signature scheme. After the work of Chaum, lots of blind signature schemes were worked out based on PKI cryptosystem, the hardness of which is mostly based on the integer factorization problem or discrete logarithm problem [17?19]. However, as we all know, the issue of certificates? management is an apparent defect in this cryptosystem. Fortunately, the identity-based public key cryptography was proposed by Shamir [8] to eliminate this drawback.
Owing to the good advantages of ID-based cryptosystem, the first ID-based blind signature scheme was worked out by Zhang and Kim [20]. Later, Huang et al. [21] proposed another ID-based blind signature scheme in 2005. In 2008, a generalized ID-based blind signature with bilinear pairings was designed by Kalkan et al. [22]. Then, in 2010, Rao et al. [23] constructed a blind signature scheme on the basis of ID-based digital signature framework proposed by Hess [24]. Following the work of Rao et al, a provably secure randomized blind signature scheme was constructed by Fan et al. [25] using bilinear pairings. Furthermore, there were two other new ID-based blind signature schemes based on bilinear pairings designed by Zhang et al. [26] and Shakerian et al. [27], respectively, in the same year.
However, in 2011, He et al. [28] proposed a novel ID-based blind signature scheme using no bilinear pairings. Their work opened up a new direction in the design of the ID-based blind signature scheme, because the new blind signature scheme constructed by them guaranteed both high efficiency and anonymity. Later, a new provably secure and pairing-free ID-based partially blind signature scheme was worked out by Islam et al. [29] in 2016, which was used in an online e-cash system. Besides, this scheme was provably secure in the random oracle model. In 2017, an untraceable ID-based blind signature scheme without pairing for e-cash payment system was proposed by Kumar et al. [30]. Then, James et al. [31] proposed an efficient pairing-free ID-based blind signature scheme with message recovery in 2018.
Although ID-based cryptosystem can solve the efficiency drawback of schemes in PKI cryptosystem, it cannot resist the attack of quantum algorithms. In 2010, the first lattice-based blind signature scheme was proposed by R?ckert [12], which was provably secure in the random oracle model. Later, in 2017, a novel round-optimal lattice-based blind signature scheme used in the cloud services was constructed by Zhu et al. [32]. Similarly, a new postquantum blind signature scheme on lattice was proposed by Zhang et al. [13] in 2018, in which the unimodal rejection sampling technology was used to improve the probability of generating a valid signature.
Unfortunately, the efficiency problem still existed in these schemes because they were designed under the PKI cryptosystem. So some ID-based blind signature schemes were worked out to deal with this disadvantage of previous schemes. In 2014, Zhang and Ma [33] proposed a lattice-based proxy blind signature scheme based on ID-based cryptosystem, whose security was held in the standard model. Then, another ID-based blind signature scheme on lattice was constructed by Gao et al. [34] in 2016, which was based on the standard model. Interestingly, a two-round ID-based blind signature scheme on lattice was still proposed by Gao et al. [35] on the random oracle model in 2017. In addition, this scheme was proved to have the power to resist the selective identity and chosen message attacks to remain unforgeable and unconditionally blind based on the SIS problem.
However, no aborting technology or only unimodal rejection sampling was used in these schemes. In 2013, Ducas et al. [36] proposed a modified aborting technology based on the original rejection sampling, called bimodal Gaussians rejection sampling, which reduces the rejecting field between the actual sampling distribution function and the expected sampling distribution function. This means that the signer can generate a valid signature with fewer samples. Additionally, this new aborting technology still keeps the basic ability to prevent the leakage of information of the signer?s secret key. Therefore, using the bimodal Gaussian rejection sampling, a new ID-based blind signature scheme on lattice is constructed in this paper based on the work of Zhang et al. [13]. Our scheme has the excellent ability to resist quantum algorithm and high efficiency, combining the advantages of lattice-based cryptosystem with that of ID-based cryptosystem.
3. Preliminaries
In this section, the basic knowledge about lattices will be described firstly. Next, we introduce the Gaussian distribution in detail.
3.1. Lattices
A lattice is defined as a discrete additive subgroup of n-dimensional Euclidean vector space . Namely, if are linearly independent vectors in , a lattice is the set of all integer combinations of these vectors:and the matrix is one base of . Normally, is described as its corresponding dimension.
In particular, the following two types of lattices should be paid more attention, called module lattice:
3.1.1. Small Integer Solution (SIS) Problem
Given a positive integer , a matrix , and a real number , the SIS problem is to find a nonzero vector such that , and . This kind of SIS problem is homogeneous. As for inhomogeneous SIS problem, it is to find a nonzero preimage satisfying , where .
Then, there are two important algorithms used in our protocol, which are applied to generate the secret keys of the trusted third party and the signer.
3.1.2. Trapdoor Generation Algorithm
An integer , ; there is an effective algorithm that can generate a matrix and a basis of the lattice . Besides, the distribution of the matrix is the uniform distribution in approximately and the orthogonal matrix .
3.1.3. General Preimage Sampling Algorithm
There are an integer , a prime number , and a positive integer . The lattice is defined by the matrix . Additionally, the matrix is a base of the lattice . If the parameter of the Gaussian distribution , there is a polynomial-time algorithm , where is a random matrix defined in , sampling a matrix in a distribution closing to , such that .
3.2. Gaussian Distribution and Bimodal Gaussian Rejection Sampling
3.2.1. Gaussian Distribution
In statistics, the distribution function of continuous Gaussian distribution is , where is the center and is the standard deviation. Furthermore, if , we usually make the equation simpler, writing it as . In the case of lattice , the function is . So the discrete Gaussian distribution over is written as . Meanwhile, the discrete Gaussian distribution defined over is normally described as . If the center , we usually write these two symbols as and .
In the following, some theorems on the discrete Gaussian distribution are shown.
Theorem 1. We assume that , so the following formula holds:
Furthermore, if we have , and for any element , the following conclusion is made out:
Theorem 2. It is described that we have , where , and is an element in . We have
Theorem 3. If the matrix is chosen randomly and , we have that , whose distribution is uniform approximately in .
3.2.2. Rejection Sampling
The rejection sampling is a useful aborting skill in lattice-based schemes. Speaking in formal terms, when the positive constant and a special distribution are given, we need to find another distribution , which makes . So we can say that the distribution is seen as another distribution with the probability . In general, is the mean value of times to get an effective sample.
(1) Rejection Sampling Lemma. It is assumed that is a distribution whose preimage is , where , and maps to . When , we can have a constant to give the distribution of the following output:(1).(2).(3)The is given out with the probability is within the statistical distance of another distribution:(1)(2)(3)The output is sent with the probability
(2) Bimodal Gaussian Rejection Sampling. In the original Gaussian rejection sampling, the mean value of repetitions of the sampling is , when the standard deviation , where the Gaussian ?tail-cut? factor is proportional to the square root of the security parameter.
In this paper, we introduce the bimodal Gaussian rejection sampling in our scheme to get a smaller rejection area and signature size. As the paper in [13] mentioned, is considered as signer?s signature. But the form of the signature must be changed if we need to use the bimodal Gaussian rejection sampling in the scheme. Before the signer begins to sign the message, a random bit is sampled. Then, the relevant signature is . Thus, the probability distribution of is . According to the requirement of rejection sampling, firstly, the inequality must be held. Secondly, we need to make as small as possible. For the sake of interpretation, we give out the following formula:
Because there is a fact in math that the inequality is always true for any , we can get the value by making get the value instead of the value . It is easy to see that the mean value in the bimodal Gaussian rejection sampling is smaller than that of original Gaussian rejection sampling. Besides, we know that the size of the final signature on lattice is roughly so that this size of the signature produced by using this rejection sampling is much shorter.
4. Security Model
In this section, the security model of the blind signature will be introduced in detail. Normally, in addition to all kinds of security attributes that a general signature scheme has, a blind signature should have two more security attributes:(i)Blindness: the signer does not know the specific content of the actual message signed by itself.(ii)Unforgeability: after a message is signed, the signer who gets the signature of this message cannot link this signature to the details of the corresponding process.
In fact, blindness means that a malicious signer can only get information independent of the actual message. In particular, there is a formal game used to describe the blindness.
4.1. Blindness Game
If any probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm cannot win the following game, we will consider the corresponding ID-based signature protocol as blind. In this game, there are two honest users and . In addition, is considered to be a malicious signer. The game of blindness is defined as follows:(1) gets the public parameters by querying .(2) performs . Namely, can get the secret key of the identity by using Key Extract algorithm.(3) chooses a random bit secretly. Then it sends a pair of messages to and .(4) executes the signature scheme with and , respectively. The messages input by and are and .(5)The outputs and received by and are sent to in arbitrary order.(6) outputs a bit .
It is worth noting that wins the game of blindness if and only if . Moreover, we consider as the advantage of to win this game.
Next, another security game aimed at unforgeability will be defined as below. In this game, acts as the challenger and is an adversary playing as a user.
4.2. Unforgeability Game
We think that can break the unforgeability of an ID-based blind signature scheme, if makes extract queries and issue queries during the time and the corresponding advantage of is at least. Otherwise, this scheme is unforgeability. The game of unforgeability is defined as follows:(1)Setup: after inputting the security parameter , runs the Setup algorithm to generate the systematic public parameter and the master secret key . Then, the public parameter is sent to .(2)Query: there are three kinds of queries that can choose to send to .(a)Hash query: after getting this query, would select a random value and return it to . It is worth noting that random oracle queries are responded by the challenger consistently.(b)Extract query: after receiving this query, would run the Key Extract algorithm to get the relevant secret key and give it back to .(c)Issue query: after obtaining this query, executes the sign algorithm with cooperatively to get the signature . But before this operation, would get the ?s secret key by performing the extract query. Finally, the signature is given back to .(3)Forgery: after the above query phase, will use the useful information to forge a signature corresponding to the message of the user, of which identity is . Additionally, outputs valid signature pairs , where . If the following conditions are satisfied by these signature pairs, we can conclude that wins this game. Furthermore, is the advantage of to get final success in this game.(a)For any and , we have that , where and .(b).(c) never uses the extract query to get the secret key of the user whose identity is .
Generally, an ID-based blind signature is considered to have blindness and unforgeability, if and of any polynomial time adversary are negligible.
5. Our Scheme
In this section, we will introduce our ID-based blind signature scheme in detail. Notably, there are two important algorithms used in our scheme, which are and [37, 38]. Meanwhile, public key generator (PKG) is the trusted third party.
5.1. System Setup
After getting the safety parameter and , PKG performs the following four steps:(1)Choosing a prime number , , , and , where .(2)Executing the algorithm , where . These matrices and are the public key and the secret key of PKG, respectively.(3)Selecting two secure hash functions and . Actually, .(4)Making the parameters public and keeping as a secret.
5.2. Key Extraction Phase
In our scheme, PKG uses the following method to generate the user?s key pair. The key extract phase is shown in Figure 1.(1)Computing and performing the algorithm . We can know that and .(2)Owing to , getting , and choosing rows of randomly and then computing the relevant transposed matrix and finally calculating .(3)Computing and , where is the unit matrix, and then making the computation . So, and are the user?s public keys and is the corresponding secret key.
5.3. Sign Phase
Essentially, this phase is an interactive three-move identification scheme over lattice based on SIS problem. It is assumed that is the actual message needed to be signed. The specific interaction process is as follows:(1)The signer selects a random vector and calculates . Then, is transmitted to the user.(2)Blind: the user chooses two blind factors and and computes . Noticeably, is the message to be signed and is a random value. Besides, the function is a commitment. Then, is worked out, where . Finally, is sent to the signer by using the bimodal Gaussian rejection sampling to stop from leaking some information of .(3)BSign: the signer selects randomly. Upon that, it can compute . Similarly, is sent to the user in the same way to hide relevant information of .(4)Unblind: the user can get the value of . Then, is output by the unimodal Gaussian rejection sampling. If , we make , where is the rejection region of Gaussian sampling. Otherwise, we have . Finally, is given to the signer.(5)After holding , the signer checks whether the value of is or not. If it holds, the blind signature is valid. On the contrary, if , , and , the signer restarts the sign phase with the user.
The sign phase is shown in Figure 2.
5.4. Verify Phase
In this phase, the verifier should check whether the following conditions are right or not:(1)(2)
Actually, is the final signature pair. If the two above conditions are satisfied, we have .
5.5. Correctness Analysis Phase
In this section, we mainly talk about the correctness and repetition of our blind signature. Firstly, we have
Thus, we have the fact that ?=?. Additionally, on the basis of Theorem 1 and rejection sampling lemma, there is with overwhelming probability.
Next, because the bimodal Gaussian rejection sampling is used in two places in our scheme, the mean value of repetitions is smaller than that of the original scheme. According to the introduction of Gaussian distribution, we have that
In the rejection sampling lemma, we need to keep as small as possible. Therefore, the value of is worked out, where , and . Obviously, and are both less than the original values in the general rejection sampling, but not . Therefore, it means that a valid blind signature can be generated successfully in lesser repetitions, whose specific number is .
6. Security Proof
In this section, we mainly prove that our scheme is blind and unforgeable by using the security model defined in Section 4. In fact, we need a malicious adversary to play games of security with a challenger.
6.1. Blindness
We mainly prove the blindness of our scheme from the indistinguishability of views. Normally, views are the information conveyed between the signer and the users, as the following theorem shows.
Theorem 4. The proposed ID-based blind signature scheme on lattice has blindness.
Proof. As the game of blindness shows, a dishonest signer selects two messages and . Then these messages are sent to two honest users and , where . Then this malicious signer plays the game of blindness with and in the interactive way, respectively. Therefore, we can prove that our ID-based blind signature scheme is blind to by showing all outputs of the users are independent of the relevant messages signed. We can see from the proposed scheme that the outputs are and the final signature . Because we have that , is always a random number in the view of . Therefore, we can only consider two values and .
Firstly, we consider about . We assume that and are generated in the game of blindness. is held by . Similarly, is corresponding to . In our scheme, we can know that , where can be seen as a random value. Besides, is transmitted by using the bimodal Gaussian rejection sampling. Therefore, after getting and , cannot link and to their respective messages or . It is because the distribution of and is both , but the output distribution of them is the same as that of under the bimodal Gaussian rejection sampling, which is . In fact, the mean value of the distribution of should be different from that of . However, we know these mean values can be considered as a random number. So we set the mean value as uniformly for sake of simplicity. So we can say that the statistical distance between and is 0; namely, .
Next, we talk about . In the proposed scheme, we have that , where is a blind factor. However, the output way of is different from that of the above challenge , because the Gaussian rejection sampling used in this place is unimodal rather than bimodal. But this cannot make an influence on the blindness. Similarly, we assume that is the final signature of and is related signature received. Similarly, we set the mean value of distribution of and as . It is because the value is computed by the signer that the distribution of and is both . According to the Gaussian rejection sampling, the output distribution of and is the same as that of , which is . Therefore, cannot determine the corresponding messages of and from their output distribution. That is, the relevant statistical distance .
On the contrary, we assume that gets the corresponding parameters and the secret key by playing the game of blindness with and . Besides, and are information has after playing this game. It is worth noting that if uses the method of guessing a random value of without any help to win the game of blindness, this probability is .
In addition, for , , and are the data exchanged between the signer and the user, when the issue query is performed by the user. Finally, and are returned to the dishonest signer . For each , there are two random blind factors that map to . Thus, and . Since , where is the unit matrix, we haveIn the above equations, are two elements in one view and are two data in another view. Besides, two blind factors and are always included in the equation, which result in the indistinguishability to . Therefore, the probabilistic polynomial time adversary makes out the right value of successfully with probability .
In a word, our ID-based blind signature scheme on lattice has the security attribute of blindness.
6.2. Unforgeability
In fact, unforgeability ensures that valid signatures can be output by a malicious user at most. is the maximum of queries that this adversary can make to the challenger. As the process of the game of unforgeability, we will give out the specific steps of this game on the basis of the proposed scheme.
Theorem 5. If is a probabilistic polynomial time adversary, it can break our ID-based blind signature on lattice with the nonnegligible probability. So, we can construct a polynomial-time algorithm using as its subroutine to solve the SIS problem with overwhelming probability.
Proof. We assume that and are the maximum of queries that can make to the random oracle and the signer. Furthermore, the values of responses of the random oracle are determined in advance. Thus, we have , where , because the adversary would make a query to before sending a signature query. As shown in the following content, plays the game of unforgeability with the challenger :(i)Setup: after inputting the security parameter , the challenger picks a random matrix and a hash function . Additionally, the random oracle is controlled by . Then, these systematic public parameters are opened to .(ii)Query: can make four types of queries to : query, query, extract query, and issue query. It is worth noting that could maintain four empty lists before answering to those queries, namely, , , , and . The specific processes of the answers to these queries will be displayed as follows:(1) query: as mentioned above, holds an empty list in advance, whose form of item is . After receiving an query about the identity , searches the corresponding item in firstly. If there is an element , gives to as its response. Otherwise, chooses a matrix at random, whose columns obey the distribution . Then, computes . According to Theorems 1 and 3 in the Gaussian Distribution section, and a random matrix are held with nonnegligible probability. Finally, the new item is inserted into . Besides, is returned to .(2)Extract query: after acquiring this query, looks for the corresponding item in firstly. Then gets a random matrix from the matrix , where . Moreover, can compute the transposed matrix of the matrix and we assign the value of to . In the end, is inserted in and is given back to . If a corresponding item does not exist, picks a random matrix and makes an query. Similarly, the new item is added in the list and the relevant matrix is transmitted to . Furthermore, calculates . Then, can compute and give to the adversary as the public key of the user whose identity is .(3) query: similarly, the challenger maintains an empty list , of which item is . When launches an query, searches the corresponding item in . If there is a related item in , the element is given back to . Otherwise, the answer to the adversary is a random that is not used yet, . Besides, the new item is added in .(4)Issue query: after acquiring this query, searches for the corresponding item on the basis of in . Then, uses as the secret key to execute the sign algorithm. Indeed, we can get the final signature . Finally, sends to as a response to this issue query.(iii)Forgery: after completing valid issue queries, gives out valid message-signature pairs with nonnegligible probability . It is worth noting that we always have .If the response to an query is predetermined, namely, , can make as the answer of the random oracle with the probability . Here, is the size of output set of the random oracle . In other words, is one element in with probability . Therefore, can make a successful forgery with the probability , where comes from . As mentioned previously, the query can take place in two places, so we need to talk about the specific scheme in two different scenarios:(1)Scenario 1: is generated by during responding to an issue query made by . Because is the response of a signature on , we can have . Thus, we must have that and . If not, it means that we can find a collision of the hash function . So, we can make a conclusion that . Besides, we have , because .(2)Scenario 2: is an answer of the random oracle . In order to solve the SIS problem, replays the game of unforgeability with . However, there is something different from the first process of this game. changes the values of response of random oracle , which is . are different random values. According to the General Forking Lemma, can forge a new signature of with the probability , such that and . Additionally, the probability of isBecause of , we can haveIn addition, and are held. Thus, with overwhelming probability, we haveIf , then a valid solution of the SIS hard problem is found. Thus, we need to prove that the probability of is overwhelming. According to the property of minimum entropy of the preimage, we can know that there is another secret key such that , which is different from . Additionally, the adversary cannot distinguish the secret key from , after getting the view . Currently, we assume the secret key used in this game is . Furthermore, we calculate by the following way:As mentioned above, we have , so the equation is set up. Then we can get . Therefore, the event that wants to tell the relevant secret on the basis of could not take place. Then, we haveSo, if , we can get the conclusion that is satisfied. Simultaneously, the adversary cannot tell which secret key is used by the challenger in the game. Thus, is set up with the probability at least.
7. Performance Evaluation
In this section, the performance analysis of our scheme is talked about in detail. Generally, we will give out the result of comparison between our scheme and two other representative articles in terms of communication complexity and computing complexity. Specifically, these data are mainly derived from the signature?s size and computational cost of generating system parameters of the relevant scheme. Currently, most of the lattice-based blind signature schemes are proved secure in the random oracle model, where the scheme in [39] proposed by R?ckert was the most authoritative in 2010. Besides, another blind scheme was proposed by Zhang et al. [13] in 2018, on which we design our new ID-based blind signature scheme. It is worth noting that we do not consider the computational cost of the key extraction phase of our scheme when we make a comparison of the performance between our scheme and Zhang et al.?s [13] signature scheme because their scheme is a PKI-based blind signature scheme on lattice.
Firstly, we show a detailed comparison between our scheme and the blind signature scheme proposed by Zhang et al. [13]. To keep the reasonability, we will use the same way in Zhang et al.?s scheme [13] to choose the public system parameters. Namely, the security level of our scheme is the same as that of the scheme [13] proposed by Zhang et al. owing to the Hermite factor defined in [40], which can reach 80 bits. Table 1 shows some important system parameters in these two schemes, where are used to keep the hardness of SIS problem.

2.72		2.7
2.72		2.7
1.1		1.1
In Table 1, the parameters of the rejection sampling in our scheme are smaller than those of the scheme [13] proposed by Zhang et al. obviously. This is because the bimodal Gaussian rejection sampling is used in our scheme. Specifically, the size of a challenge is determined by the parameter . In general, should satisfy the condition to keep the correctness error at . According to rejection sampling lemma, we need to keep the rejection area between the actual distribution and objective distribution as small as possible. In this way, the signature algorithm can generate a valid signature using as few repetitions as possible. On the basis of the property of bimodal Gaussian rejection sampling, we only need to require that instead of . In this case, the bimodal Gaussian rejection sampling can work with the minimum mean value . Normally, because and are the mean values of the bimodal Gaussian rejection sampling, they are independent of , and , . For , we have that when . This can hold because we have and . Similarly, we can get the optimal value of while we make that . However, because is the mean value of the unimodal rejection sampling, we need to only require that . In addition, the distribution of the final signature is . By Theorem 1, we can determine that the size of ?s every coefficient is with the probability at least . Because the value of in our scheme is far less than that in Zhang et al.?s scheme [13], we can get the smaller valid signature that is equal to bits approximately. Additionally, our , , and are smaller than those of the scheme proposed by Zhang et al. [13]. This means our blind signature scheme can use less time to generate a valid signature in the same security level. In the end, what we need to emphasize is that our blind signature scheme on lattice is based on the ID-based cryptosystem, which has already stronger efficiency than the PKI cryptosystem.
Next, we will give out the comparison between our scheme and the classical scheme proposed by R?ckert et al. simply [39]. Here, and are the common system parameters in these two schemes. Moreover, is the bit size of the user?s identity and is the expansive Gaussian parameter in R?ckert et al.?s scheme [39]. We can know that the size of final signature in our scheme is . According to the explanation of R?ckert et al. [39], the size of signature is in their ID-based blind scheme. Obviously, it is easy to make the conclusion that the signature?s size in our scheme is smaller than that of R?ckert et al.?s scheme [39] in the random oracle model. In terms of computing complexity, there are only some simple operators involved in our sign algorithm and verify algorithm, such as scalar-multiplication on vector, addition on vector, matrix-vector multiplication, and hash function. However, in sign algorithm and verify algorithm of R?ckert et al.?s scheme [39], the complex algorithms are included to generate a valid signature, such as ExtBasis algorithm and SamplePre algorithm. So our scheme is simpler and more efficient than the scheme proposed by R?ckert et al. [39].
Based on the above result, we can make a conclusion that our scheme has less communicational and computational cost, compared with the latest blind signature scheme on lattice proposed by Zhang et al. [13] and the most authoritative blind signature scheme on lattice proposed by R?ckert et al. [39]. Thus, our scheme has more efficient and practical value in applications. Table 2 shows the result of relevant comparison in detail.

8. Conclusion
Integrating the advantage of ID-based cryptosystem with lattice-based cryptosystem, we construct an efficient and secure ID-based blind signature scheme in this paper to protect the privacy of confidential data, which can be widely applied to the e-cash and electronic voting system. Moreover, a useful aborting technology, bimodal Gaussian rejection sampling, is used in our scheme to accelerate the speed of generating a valid blind signature. Meanwhile, our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model, which is on the basis of the SIS problem. By showing the comparison with the scheme of Zhang et al. [13] and that of R?ckert et al. [39], we demonstrate the superiority of our scheme in communicational and computational efficiency.
To extend our scheme to get other useful properties and complete an original model of evaluating the extended scheme in the real application environment is the future work executed by us.

A long-time friend and I have lunch every Saturday. We go sit in a beach bar here -- these days the beaches empty, the views as preternatural as ever -- drink fizzy water, no, really, decrepit hypertensive diabetics like me want fizzy water, and, as I used to joke when we started this, well, tradition, plot world domination. We talk about business, mostly, current projects in general, making, hacking, and otherwise. Hardware, software, wetware. Guy stuff for geeks. Wetware as in the stuff between your ears. Mind outta the gutter. Perverts.
In these days of pandemic-panic-porn-induced incipient global collapse -- both the empty beaches thing in what used to be the kickoff of high tourist season around here, but also what could fairly be called a US electoral fight for the survival of western civilization -- one can say ?world domination? with a tinge of anger in one?s voice about the other side, so the joke isn?t very funny anymore. Besides, both of us are way too old for that world domination shit anymore. We?re lucky if we can hobble off to a beach bar, have a chicken caesar for lunch, and get home in one piece. Well, I am, anyway. He seems to be doing better. I need some new knees, among other things, which I?m not likely to get anytime soon here in formerly-libertarian paradise, and short of an unaffordable medical airlift to the States, practically impossible in any case with the quarantine, I?m not going anywhere anytime soon.
So, at the moment, my friend is desperately trying to keep his eyes from rolling back into his head. Because he?s driving.
I?m trying to explain to him, in as much detail as I can muster as he swerves his not-quite-a-pickup around a pothole, the current state of play in this whole business with the Universal Voter Fraud, and the Soros guy who?s now a life peer, and Chavez standing over the guy with the keyboard changing the numbers on a constitutional referendum giving him absolute dictatorial power, and... Wait, he says, these machines are hooked up the the net?? Well, yeah. I think, anyway... That?s bullshit. I can?t believe that for a minute. Nobody?d be that stupid. Well, anyway, they did a rush software update the night before the election, so, what, FedEx and flash cards? And it?s running on, what, Windows 7? Oh, come on. No, really. Pretty sure...
I mean, I?m not even sure Windows 7 had internet sockets in it, or whatever, I?m a Mac guy, bleed in five colors and all that, no, not those five colors. Pervert. But that?s how fun things here in the Year of Our Lord 2020. As John Batchelor, The World?s Last Gentleman, no, really, look at his little videos on Instagram these days, liked to say during the once-and-future GWOT, ?In war, the first three reports are wrong.? And we?re only two reports in. Maybe one and a half. My friend and I are old-school cypherpunks, you see. And no, crypto doesn?t mean ?cryptocurrency?, it means ?strong cryptography?. We even started a conference here on what I called ?financial cryptography? a few decades back, so we even get to claim at least passing familiarity, if very dated in my case, and fuzzy at the best of times, with the idea of machine security in the presence of a, cough, global geodesic internetwork.
On cypherpunks, back in the day, it was all about spooks, crypto protocols, financial and otherwise, rubber hose attacks, more spooks, actual fucking Rothbardian anarchy, not that statist commie black-block crap that passes for it these days, and, well, world domination.  Punks these days give millennialism a bad name. Get off my lawn. So, I?m very prepared to believe Sidney Powell.
I just saw a NewsMax clip on YouTube(spit!) where she says she?s gonna kick off the fun in Georgia, and, she says, it?s going to be biblical. Make it rain, baby girl. Make it rain. The fate or Western Civilization is in your hands. No pressure.

I cast bread on the waters, and the goldfish come? But none dare call it post hoc ergo propter hoc?
I wouldn?t deny reducing the above colloquy-on-the-way-to-a-beach-bar in question to predicate calculus may be, um, entertaining? Lord Mark Malloch-Brown. Life peer. Soros partner. Strike one...
Yup. We?ll see. They tried to present a scad of depositions sworn on penalty of perjury to a judge. Who refused to see the evidence. They?re appealing. And doing a, cough, legislative hearing, where the actual constitutional responsibility lies. Are we having fun yet?
But meanwhile? I prefer to think she?s been put on indefinite waivers. :-) Meh. She?s gotta criminal case. They?ve got a civil, probably a constitutional case. Criminal cases take forever. The constitution says not forever. This?ll sort itself out. Then we?ll see.
Funny you should say that.
See "criminal case", above. So, I spout Newsmax, and the constitution, not just legislation: Count every *legal* vote. Your cryptofeudal coreligionists spout MSNBC or CNN: Count every vote for progressives only. And, as a result, you and I, as usual for the past almost thirty years, seem to be, um, spouting, on each other. Fortunately I was born with some talent in that regard. My father won a third-grade contest where he pissed over the outhouse behind his one-room Wisconsin school. How about yours? Or did they teach you that at OxBridge instead?
Meanwhile, I bet we both agree that cryptography gives anonymity though you can sell your vote (where I come from that?s called ?equity in bearer form?), and *political* voting requires both anonymity and the non-transferability of your vote to be legal. Certainly you can?t do that with a ?blockchain?, whatever that means without proof of work. We?re proving that anything else, particularly the legitimacy, much less legality, of code owned by an entity domiciled practically next door to a certain Peer and his associated foundation, demonstrates that Turing machines, do, in fact, require a copy to function, proving as a result that the union of both electronic election and ?intellectual property? law, is, as the man said, an ass. SWIDT? Beating my subject-object agreement like a dead horse, er boss, er, something?
I seem to remember, almost exactly twenty years ago, when virtually the entire population of FC01 spent a morning session, through lunch, trying to re-do Bush v. Gore with crypto. In light of the contradiction above, the discussion of the cryptography?s application to political voting again here is utterly, um, nondispositive. Certainly not *financial* cryptography, which I was prompted to observe after hours of discussion and patiently waiting at the question microphone to get a word in edgewise.
Paradoxically, the canonical solution here is, in fact, Canada?s: ticking the box. A paper ballot, a pen, a box, a human counting the votes, supervised by a representative of each candidate. It scales. Any country can be counted in hours, there are few disputes, and the result is, in fact dispositive.
Anything else is Mummenschanz. Which is what any Rothbardian would call democracy anyway.
Nice to know you?re still on this side of the grass, Phill.
