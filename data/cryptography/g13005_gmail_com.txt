@_subject: the return of key escrow? 
Ok the lurker posts...
Can someone explain to me why security specialists think this:
"The system uses BitLocker Drive Encryption through a chip called TPM
(Trusted Platform Module) in the computer's motherboard."
is going to stop authorities from retreiving data?
I ask this question on the basis of their encrypted hard drive on the old
xbox. It supposedly used a secure key so the hard drive couldn't be
upgraded, yet this fact didn't slow down the modd scene. Its not as if they
are hardware encrypting tightly is it?
Just curious I guess.
"The knack of flying is learning how to throw yourself at the ground and
"He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes
wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it."
"He inched his way up the corridor as if he would rather be yarding his way
down it..."
"We demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty!"
"I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by."
