Not sure I agree, because of the scope of initial and subsequent distribution and the target of enforcement actions.
Copyright holders usually aim to maximise profitable distribution, and  DMCA-like enforcement is aimed at consumers. Privacy requires minimal initial disclosure of information, followed by (at least in jurisdictions such as the EU that support fair information practices) corporate enforcement, which is much easier.

I think to some extent, the next-generation mobile standards (UMTS/3GPP) will do this automatically... GSM currently encrypts the air interface between phone and base station; 3GPP pushes this much further back into the network (all the way back to a device in the user's home network, I think). Unfortunately I don't think two 3GPP phones talking to each other will do end-to-end  -- saves the phone companies having to implement MITM or escrow functionality for law enforcement interfaces :(

Unfortunately, a lot of legal people have been convinced by the notion. The UK's law implementing the EU's digital signature directive allows
the burden of proof to be shifted so that the "signer" of a message has to prove they did NOT make it; the opposite to the physical signature situation. Many British banks' online terms and conditions say that customers are liable for any instructions authenticated by their password before it's revoked, never mind a digital signature.

Wrong; it eradicates the second type. Our innovative US hardware sector will be ready with compliant machines the day the Act comes into force.
Wrong again; economies of scale will mean the entire industry will unite to build on the important work by the TCPA, 4C Entity (or however many Cs there are these days) and Microsoft to add this capability at minimal cost.
It won't take long to use the WIPO, WTO, and good 'ole US strongarm tactics to impose this legislation on the rest of the world. Meanwhile, we impose crippling sanctions on any company with any US exposure that produces such devices. cf Cuba, war on drugs, etc. etc.
Who cares about innovation if it isn't contributing campaign dollars?
Sorry for my cynicism :(

Not when it comes to liability for disputed transactions... I don't know
about other countries, but UK banks tend to put statements such as "Our
records of transactions shall be conclusive unless the user can prove
otherwise" in online terms and conditions:
Not to mention using symmetric rather than asymmetric crypto to authenticate
specific instructions from the user, in one place where you *really* don't
want someone in control of the relevant bank system to be able to forge
Relevence to the Pd debate is that banks may in future insist on remote
attestation of users' software (however practically possible that is) so
that they can attempt to dump yet more liability on their users ("Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury, Mr Doe's claim that he did not authorise this
transfer to a Caribbean account is obviously fraudulent as his Fritz chip
proved to us that his system had not been compromised"...)

"Lay people often react to differential pricing for the same good with a
sense of unfairness. No matter how many times they are lectured by the
economists that it is actually to the benefit of all that producers be able
to charge different prices to groups with different ability and willingness
to pay, the popular reaction is normally "that's not fair."
Economists have tended to view this as a sign of the public's naive failure
to understand market mechanisms. If the drug company can charge the poor
nation a low price and the rich nation a high price for the same drug, all
will be better off. It is better, then, that gray markets, parallel imports,
and resale be prohibited. Popular resistance can be branded as a kind of
economically illiterate Jacobinism. There is certainly some truth to this
depiction; there are indeed benefits to price discrimination under certain
circumstances. But I would like to think that the popular skepticism towards
price discrimination also reflects something much more rational. Lacking
time to educate themselves in every aspect of market and culture, the public
tends to be skeptical when an industry claims that expert opinion shows that
what is good for the company will also be good for the nation, and that
state aid in enforcing its desires will produce an economically efficient
result. And you know what? Given the arguments reviewed in this Paper, I
would say that the public has a point."

As a voter could record what they did with pencil-and-paper or a
mechanical voting machine.
The partial defence in all three systems is that the voter should be
able to void the vote after photographing a "receipt" to hand over later
to the vote-buyer, and then cast a real vote. In the UK, for example,
you can obtain a new ballot paper from a polling station official in
exchange for a "spoiled" one. I believe Rebecca Mercuri has always
suggested that a voter should be able to confirm whether a receipt
printed by an electronic voting machine correctly records their intended
vote, and if not to void it.

Indeed, that's essential for both the reasons you state.
Mercuri's design is for the voter to see the printed receipt behind a
glass screen. They then press a "Yes" or "No" button to either vote and
send the receipt to the trustworthy record, or void it and send the
receipt to the bin.

I believe many e-voting machines "meet" this requirement by printing out a tally of votes *when the election has closed* -- and so the voter doesn't get to check that the paper record actually matches the vote they intended to cast :(

I'd guess that many of the developing-world human rights groups funded by OSI would have legitimate reason to worry about wiretapping conducted by well-resourced opponents in their governments. They might also discuss information on a secure communication facility that they would avoid on a PSTN phone. So it's important they know where Skype lies on the spectrum between the two.

The former seems to be a very specific statute concerning interception
devices, which doesn't illuminate the more general type of vicarious
liability he alludes to in the latter quote. This alone doesn't seem to
justify a general warning to developers of "anonymizing programs, wipe
or delete programs, evidence eliminators, or even (potentially) access
control programs, if developers know or should know that these will be
used for obstruction of justice".

If your threat model includes attacks on the system(s) you use to decrypt messages, or rubber hose/subpoena key-cracking, expiring *and wiping* confidentiality keys limits the time during which the keys can be compromised using those methods.
