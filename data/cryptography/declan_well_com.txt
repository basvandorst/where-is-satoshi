@_subject: South Africa moves to increase Net-surveillance, limit crypto 
A quick summary of South Africa's "Interception and Monitoring" bill, which has cleared the Cabinet and is heading for a vote in the Parliament:
* Internet providers and telephone companies must provide a pipe to a National Monitoring Center for Carnivoresque surveillance. "The Police Service, the Defence Force, the Agency, the Service and the Directorate must, at State expense, establish, equip, operate and maintain central monitoring centres... Duplicate signals of communications authorized to be monitored in terms of this Act, must be routed by the service provider concerned to the designated central monitoring centre concerned."
* Internet providers may not "provide any telecommunication service which does not have the capacity to be monitored." A provider is responsible for "decrypting any communication encrypted by a customer if the facility for encryption was provided by the service provider concerned." This represents an attack on liberty, privacy, and autonomy, and is akin to anti-encryption rules in Russia a few years ago. Though as a practical matter, a lot would seem to turn on the definition of "provide." Does that mean giving someone an SSL-enabled web browser? IPv6 software?
* The legislation bans the provision of anonymous Internet access. It says: "A service provider must... require from such person his or her full names, residential, business or postal address and identity number."
* Internet providers and telcos must pay for their own surveillance. "A service provider must at own cost and within the period, if any, specified by the Minister of Communications in a directive referred to in subsection (4)(a), acquire the necessary facilities and devices to enable the monitoring of communications in terms of this Act. The investment, technical, maintenance and operating costs in enabling a telecommunication service to be monitored, must be carried by the service provider providing such a service."
* Internet providers cannot reveal wiretaps. "No person who is or was concerned in the performance of any function in terms of this Act, may disclose any information which he or she obtained in the performance of such a function" (except to officials or courts).

Protests over SA 'snooping' bill
2001-08-13 06:10:06
    By Philippa Garson in Johannesburg
    Protests are growing in South Africa against the country's plan to
    give the security services new powers to monitor terrorists and
    serious criminals.
    Opponents say the Interception and Monitoring Bill is draconian,
    describing it as a charter for government snooping.
    Given only three weeks to make submissions on the Bill, non-government
    organisations have been making last-ditch attempts to garner more time
    to respond before the 13 August deadline.
    The bill was quietly passed by South Africa's Cabinet last month,
    largely catching the public unawares.
    It provides for state monitoring of all telecommunications systems,
    including mobile phones, internet and e-mail, once permission has been
    granted by relevant authorities.
    In most cases a judge must grant the order, but in some instances a
    police or army officer of a particular rank may do so.

The Washington Post finally catches on to the fact that the Scarfo case exists, a few weeks after everyone else wrote about the hearing in Newark. The front-page story today by Jonathan Krim contains this memorable passage:
"Encryption is virtually unbreakable by police today, with programs that can be bought for $15," said Stewart Baker, former general counsel of the National Security Agency and now partner at the Washington law firm Steptoe & Johnson. Although agreeing that surveillance should be done under strict guidelines, Baker said that "to a degree, the privacy groups got us into this by arguing that there should be no limits on encryption, and the police have to deal with it."

Pentagon Hides Behind Onion Wraps
    By Declan McCullagh (declan at wired.com)
    2:00 a.m. Aug. 17, 2001 PDT
    [...]
    [Paul] Syverson said that the U.S. government was awarded patent number
    6,266,704 for Onion Routing on July 24.
    That announcement prompted an angry reaction from Usenix attendees,
    many of whom are programmers, security consultants and system
    administrators, who aren't big fans of software patents -- especially
    in the area of anonymous communications, where there's been so much
    prior work before the Navy ever got involved.
    Mathematician David Chaum, for instance, wrote an article titled
    "Untraceable Electronic Mail, Return Addresses and Digital Pseudonyms"
    for Communications of the ACM as far back as 1981. Lance Cottrell, who
    now runs anonymizer.com, wrote part of the mixmaster system in the
    early 1990s, and similar techniques were discussed on the cypherpunks
    mailing list even earlier.
    Syverson, who is listed on the patent with co-inventors Michael Reed
    and David Goldschlag, defended the government's move. "It is a
    necessary step for those of us working for the government to bring
    technology to the public," Syverson said.
    The patent describes Onion Routing, which has been the subject of
    analysis at previous security conferences, as providing "an electronic
    communication path between an initiator and a responder on a
    packet-switching network comprising an onion routing network that
    safeguards against traffic analysis and eavesdropping by other users
    of the packet switching network" such as the Internet.

    Onion routing network for securely moving data through communication

                                   Abstract
    The onion routing network is used to protect Internet initiators and
    responders against both eavesdropping and traffic analysis from other
    users of the Internet. In the onion routing of the invention, instead
    of making connections directly to a responding machine, users make
    connections through onion routers. The onion routing network allows
    the connection between the initiator and responder to remain
    anonymous. Anonymous connections hide who is connected to whom and for
    what purpose from outside eavesdroppers.

      _________________________________________________________________
    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
    1.0 Field of the Invention
    The present invention relates to the field of moving user real-time
    data within a communication network and, more particularly, to a
    system which moves data within a communication network, such as the
    Internet, without revealing the identity of the initiator of the data,
    nor the identity of the receiver of the data, nor the content of the
    data.
    2.0 Description of the Prior Art
    The present invention is concerned with the right to privacy involved
    in electronic communication which may be better described by first
    discussing other forms of more commonly known communications.
    For example, letters sent through the Post Office are usually in an
    envelope marked with the sender's and recipient's addresses. The
    general public trusts that the Post Office does not peek inside the
    envelope, because the contents are private. The general public also
    trusts that the Post Office does not monitor who sends mail to whom,
    because that information is also considered private.
    These two types of sensitive information, the contents of an envelope
    and its addresses, apply equally well to electronic communication over
    the Internet. As the Internet becomes an increasing important part of
    modern day communication and electronic commerce, protecting the
    privacy of electronic messages also becomes increasingly important.
    Just like mail, electronic messages travel in envelopes, that is,
    electronic envelopes. Protecting the privacy of electronic messages
    requires both safeguarding the contents of their envelopes and hiding
    the addresses on their envelopes. Although communicating parties
    usually identify themselves to one another, there is no reason that
    the use of a public network, such as the Internet, ought to reveal to
    others who is talking to whom and what they are talking about. The
    first concern is traffic analysis, the latter is eavesdropping.
    By making both eavesdropping and traffic analysis hard, the privacy of
    communication is protected. However, anonymity need not be completely
    maintained because two parties communicating with each other may need
    to identify each other. For example, if a Web surfer wants to buy
    something using the electronic equivalent of cash, the purchaser may
    need to be identified to properly establish the debt being incurred;
    however, the network need not know any of this information.
    If an electronic envelope keeps its contents private, and the address
    on the envelope is also hidden, then any identifying information can
    only be inside the envelope. So for anonymous communication, we also
    should remove identifying information from the contents of an
    envelope. This may be called anonymizing a private envelope.
    An anonymous connection is a communications channel for which it is
    infeasible to determine both endpoints, that is, which principal
    initiated the communication and whom receives the communication. The
    principal initiating the connection is the initiator, and the
    principal to whom the initiator connects is the responder. The present
    invention implements a mechanism for anonymous connections that
    operates below the application layer and supports a variety of
    Internet applications, wherein the application layer is the highest
    layer within the hierarchy of the protocols being used to perform the
    data transfer.
    The usage of anonymous communication is known and generally referred
    to by the use of various terms in the art. For example, anonymous
    "Mixes" were introduced in 1985 as a store and forward mechanism for
    anonymously moving data through a network. These Mixes are not
    suitable for bidirectional real-time communication which is of
    importance to the present invention.
    Anonymous remailers, also known in the art, have been used to store
    and forward mail from a sender to a recipient without revealing the
    identity of the sender to observers of the network. Different versions
    of these remailers use Mixes in a highly application specific way
    which limits their applicability for other uses.
    Anonymous bidirectional real-time communication for Integrated Service
    Digital Network (ISDN) has also been explored, especially as in
    related phone switching means. Mixes are incorporated into an ISDN
    phone switch to permit anonymous connections between callers within
    the same ISDN switch. The usage of these anonymous connection means is
    dependent upon the characteristics of the ISDN phone switches which,
    in turn, has inherent limitations which, in turn, limit their usage.
    The first mention of near real-time Mixes for the Internet appears in
    the Pipe-Net techniques also known in the art. Pipe-Net's design
    provides fixed bandwidth, low-capacity communications channels
    strongly protected against both active and passive traffic analysis
    attacks. However, the fixed bandwidth and low-capacity communication
    limit their usage. Further, to our knowledge this Pipe-Net's design
    has never been built, fully described, nor formally published.
    The anonymizer, known in the art, provides weak protection against
    traffic analysis of World Wide Web (WEB) communications, by providing
    a centralized service that removes identifying information from the
    data stream. So called "Crowds" extends this approach to decentralize
    the proxy. However, the Anonymizer does not protect against passive
    attacks at the centralized proxy; whereas Crowds does not protect
    against global passive attacks. It is desired to provide a general
    purpose system that allows anonymous connections to move data through
    a communication network and that does not suffer the drawbacks of the
    prior art.

Background and collection of links to news articles:
     Release the Russian, Adobe Says
   By Declan McCullagh (declan at wired.com)
   4:33 p.m. July 23, 2001 PDT
   WASHINGTON -- In a stunning turn of events, Adobe abruptly bowed to
   public outcry and recommended the release of a Russian programmer who
   was arrested for writing code-breaking software.
   Late Monday, Adobe officials said they had changed their minds and no
   longer believed that Dmitry Sklyarov should be prosecuted for alleged
   copyright infringement.
   "We strongly support (federal copyright law) and the enforcement of
   copyright protection of digital content," Colleen Pouliot, general
   counsel for Adobe, said in a statement. "However, the prosecution of
   this individual in this particular case is not conducive to the best
   interests of any of the parties involved or the industry."
   Adobe's announcement came as hundreds of geeks-turned-activists
   protested Sklyarov's arrest in at least 10 cities, with about 100
   marchers descending on the company's San Jose headquarters, and
   representatives of the Electronic Frontier Foundation met with Adobe
   officials to try and broker a deal.

Congress No Haven for Hackers
   By Declan McCullagh (declan at wired.com)
   2:00 a.m. July 25, 2001 PDT
   WASHINGTON -- Even as the world's geeks march against the Digital
   Millennium Copyright Act, key legislators and lobbyists are dismissing
   concerns about the controversial law as hyperbole.
   The law that led to the arrest of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov
   last week and an immediate outcry among programmers continues to enjoy
   remarkably broad support on Capitol Hill. No bill has yet been
   introduced in Congress to amend the DMCA for one simple reason:
   Official Washington loves the law precisely as much as hackers and
   programmers despise it.
   "The law is performing the way we hoped," said Rep. Howard Coble
   (R-North Carolina), chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on
   intellectual property.
   The FBI arrested Sklyarov last week in Las Vegas for allegedly
   "trafficking" in software that circumvents the copy protection
   techniques that Adobe uses in its e-book format. Under the DMCA,
   selling such software is a federal felony punishable by up to five
   years in prison and a fine of $500,000.
   "As far as I know there have been very few complaints from
   intellectual property holders," Coble, the chief sponsor of the DMCA,
   said in an interview Tuesday. "I am also encouraged by the Department
   of Justice's actions in this matter to enforce the law."
   When Congress approved the DMCA in October 1998 after about a year's
   worth of little-noticed debate and negotiations, it was hardly a
   controversial bill. The Senate agreed to it unanimously, and a
   unanimous House approved it by voice vote, then bypassed a procedural
   step that would have delayed the DMCA's enactment.
   Since the House procedure says attempts to rewrite copyright law must
   start in Coble's subcommittee, the odds of a DMCA rewrite in Congress'
   lower chamber seem remote.
   Coble's counterpart in the Senate, California Democrat Dianne
   Feinstein, feels the same way.
   "We need to protect copyrights and this law was designed to do that,"
   said Howard Gantman, a spokesman for Feinstein, who chairs the Senate
   Judiciary subcommittee on technology. "She's not looking to change
   it."
   [...]
   But in the world of Washington politics, geektivists are woefully
   outnumbered by the natives who populate and influence confirmation
   hearings: Corporate, nonprofit and trade association lobbyists.
   "We believe that a careful effort was made by Congress to balance the
   rights of intellectual property owners and the rights of intellectual
   property consumers," says Allan Adler, vice president at the
   Association of American Publishers, which applauded Sklyarov's arrest
   last week.
   [...]
   The Free-Dmitry movement argues that programmers should not be
   prosecuted for creating software that can circumvent copyright
   protection -- since such tools have many legitimate uses, such as
   reading an e-book on another computer, as well.
   But DMCA aficionados say there are precedents for broad prohibitions
   on selling devices that can have both legitimate and illegitimate
   uses.
   Current federal law makes it a felony to own, distribute or advertise
   for sale bugging or wiretapping devices that are "primary useful for
   the purpose of surreptitious interception of wire, oral or electronic
   communications." That applies even to parents who might want to
   monitor what their young children are doing, or to other commonplace
   uses.
   You're also not allowed to possess hardware or software such as cell
   phone cloning devices that let you "obtain telecommunications service
   without authorization" -- even if your motives are pure.

@_subject: Criminalizing crypto criticism 
The DMCA may be bad, but it's not *that* bad. It contains a broad
prohibition against circumvention ("No person shall circumvent a
technological measure that effectively controls access") and then has
a bunch of exceptions.
One of those -- and you can thank groups like ACM for this, if my
legislative memory is correct -- explicitly permits encryption
research. You can argue fairly persuasively that it's not broad
enough, and certainly 2600 found in the DeCSS case that the judge
wasn't convinced by their arguments, but at least it's a shield of
sorts. See below.
PS: Some background on Sklyarov case:
PPS: Note you only get the exemption if you make "a good faith effort
to obtain authorization before the circumvention." Gotta love
Congress, eh?
`(g) ENCRYPTION RESEARCH-
`(1) DEFINITIONS- For purposes of this subsection--
`(A) the term `encryption research' means activities necessary to
identify and analyze flaws and vulnerabilities of encryption
technologies applied to copyrighted works, if these activities are
conducted to advance the state of knowledge in the field of encryption
technology or to assist in the development of encryption products; and
`(B) the term `encryption technology' means the scrambling and
descrambling of information using mathematical formulas or algorithms.
`(2) PERMISSIBLE ACTS OF ENCRYPTION RESEARCH- Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), it is not a violation of that
subsection for a person to circumvent a technological measure as
applied to a copy, phonorecord, performance, or display of a published
work in the course of an act of good faith encryption research if--
`(A) the person lawfully obtained the encrypted copy, phonorecord,
performance, or display of the published work;
`(B) such act is necessary to conduct such encryption research;
`(C) the person made a good faith effort to obtain authorization
before the circumvention; and
`(D) such act does not constitute infringement under this title or a
violation of applicable law other than this section, including section
1030 of title 18 and those provisions of title 18 amended by the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.
`(3) FACTORS IN DETERMINING EXEMPTION- In determining whether a person
qualifies for the exemption under paragraph (2), the factors to be
considered shall include--
`(A) whether the information derived from the encryption research was
disseminated, and if so, whether it was disseminated in a manner
reasonably calculated to advance the state of knowledge or development
of encryption technology, versus whether it was disseminated in a
manner that facilitates infringement under this title or a violation
of applicable law other than this section, including a violation of
privacy or breach of security;
`(B) whether the person is engaged in a legitimate course of study, is
employed, or is appropriately trained or experienced, in the field of
encryption technology; and
`(C) whether the person provides the copyright owner of the work to
which the technological measure is applied with notice of the findings
and documentation of the research, and the time when such notice is
`(4) USE OF TECHNOLOGICAL MEANS FOR RESEARCH ACTIVITIES-
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(2), it is not a
violation of that subsection for a person to--
`(A) develop and employ technological means to circumvent a
technological measure for the sole purpose of that person performing
the acts of good faith encryption research described in paragraph (2);
`(B) provide the technological means to another person with whom he or
she is working collaboratively for the purpose of conducting the acts
of good faith encryption research described in paragraph (2) or for
the purpose of having that other person verify his or her acts of good
faith encryption research described in paragraph (2).

Anyone want to speculate on what the quote in the first bullet
point means?
You can find a smidgen more info here (search for encryption),
which is the report I was quoting from:
  ftp://ftp.loc.gov/pub/thomas/cp107/sr042.txt
    According to the report accompanying a spending bill that's awaiting a
    floor vote in the Senate:
      * The FBI will receive an extra $7 million for technology to thwart
        encryption. The appropriations committee intends for it to be
        spent on: "(1) analysis/exploitation of systems to allow access to
        data pre-encryption, (2) recognition/decryption of data hidden in
        plain sight, and (3) decryption of encrypted data."
      * Another $7 million goes to a plan to improve "intercept
        capabilities." The fed-speak for this is "developing broadband
        capabilities, and procuring prototypes capable of intercepting
        transmissions outside of the FBI's technical reach." Translation:
        Create better ways to eavesdrop on cable modems and DSL
        connections.
      * Antitrust enforcement gets a boost. The division, best known
        recently for its dogged pursuit of Microsoft, receives $3.6
        million extra, but $10 million less than the Bush administration
        requested. The committee predicts a slew of mergers because of
        "the collapse of high technology stocks, and the resultant
        downward pressure on all stock prices."
      * Las Vegas, St. Louis, Charleston and Kansas City will split $6
        million earmarked for gun surveillance technology. The plan is to
        spend it on acoustic sensors scattered around downtown areas so
        the location of a gunshot can be triangulated and located.

   A draft of next year's budget includes plans to hire far more Justice
   Department attorneys and FBI agents who are charged with placing more
   pirates in prison.
   This comes one week after Attorney General John Ashcroft spoke in
   Mountain View, California, about the threat of online piracy. In the
   same week, geek protesters demanded the release of Dmitry Sklyarov, a
   Russian programmer arrested on felony copyright charges.
   That's exactly what should be happening, according to a Senate
   committee report. In an apparent reference to the prosecution, it
   says: "The committee is aware that the FBI has launched an initiative
   to investigate violations of federal copyright laws protecting certain
   marketed software applications. The committee supports FBI efforts..."
   The Senate has earmarked $10 million for copyright prosecutions,
   enough money for 155 agents and attorneys in the fiscal year starting
   in October. That's up from a current $4 million allocated for 75
   positions.
   Copyright holders, who applauded the prosecution of Sklyarov on
   charges of violating the controversial DMCA, said they hoped the
   additional cash will put more DMCA pirates and copyright thieves
   behind bars.

Starium has not released a product to the public, but the units have been designed and produced.
I have a pair of Stariums (if that's the proper pluralization), and
they work fine on the vast majority of phones. They plug in as a bump-in-the-cord device between the handset and the phone, and the
Starium unit I had worked with the bulk of the handsets I used. I'm
told an upgrade has fixed this minor problem, and most people won't
be traveling as much as I was.
As for the company, they closed Series A round at $2.1 million in
6/99 and are currently looking for investors for a $3m Series B round
hoping to close 7/01. As of May 30, they had $1.5m of that amount.
They've moved offices from downtown Monterey (on the waterfront) to
Carmel, and are hiring a new exective team. CEO is Frank Corsini
of AmEx and CTO is Dan Sokol.
They appear to be aiming for the complete corporate privacy solution
(my phrase, not theirs) and are filing for patents on p2p conferencing
and voicemail. I haven't yet asked for details.

That's a fair statement, since the average Windows user either doesn't use antivirus ware or doesn't keep it updated. But crank up the paranoia dial a notch -- the Sep. 11 terrorists weren't exactly stupid -- and that's arguably a different story.
Not that difficult, I suspect, with even the passive participation (merely providing tech info, not redesigning) of the antivirus firms. But the FBI would want to guard against two other possibilities: Future antivirus software detecting an installed ML, and future antivirus software detecting an attempt to install ML.
One wit recommended a way to get a wild version of ML: Create a Hotmail account with the appropriate-sounding name, post the appropriately suspicious-sounding statements in the appropriate fora, and wait for the attachments to come in. :)

We may be speaking at cross-purposes. What I would call a national ID
card is an identification device that created by the federal
government that all citizens and permanent residents are issued. The U.S., of course, has no such device. Many millions of Americans
have not traveled abroad and do not have passports.
The privacy-anonymity threat a national ID card poses is that once you
have such a card in place, a near-irresistable incentive arises for
governments to make carrying them mandatory. That could mean police
stopping you at any time, demanding to see your ID, and scanning it in
to learn information-about-you-they-wish-to-know. Extend this
prediction as appropriate to ID-card-scanners -- coupled with
biometric readers and checks against databases -- at banks, airports,
grocery stores, etc.

Senator Backs Off Backdoors
   By Declan McCullagh (declan at wired.com)

   WASHINGTON -- Sen. Judd Gregg has abruptly changed his mind and will
   no longer seek to insert backdoors into encryption products.
   A spokesman for the New Hampshire Republican said Tuesday that Gregg
   has "no intention" of introducing a bill to require government access
   to scrambled electronic or voice communications.
   "We are not working on an encryption bill and have no intention to,"
   spokesman Brian Hart said in an interview.
   Two days after the Sept. 11 attacks, Gregg strode onto the Senate
   floor and called for a global prohibition on data-scrambling products
   without backdoors for government surveillance. Gregg said that quick
   action was necessary "to get the information that allows us to
   anticipate and prevent what occurred in New York and in Washington."
   A few days later, Gregg told the Associated Press that he was
   preparing legislation "to give our law enforcement community more

    New Copyright Bill Heading to DC
    By Declan McCullagh (declan at wired.com)
    4:19 p.m. Sep. 7, 2001 PDT
    WASHINGTON -- Music and record industry lobbyists are quietly readying
    an all-out assault on Congress this fall in hopes of dramatically
    rewriting copyright laws.
    With the help of Fritz Hollings (D-S.C.), the powerful chairman of the
    Senate Commerce committee, they hope to embed copy-protection controls
    in nearly all consumer electronic devices and PCs. All types of
    digital content, including music, video and e-books, are covered.
    The Security Systems Standards and Certification Act (SSSCA),
    scheduled to be introduced by Hollings, backs up this requirement with
    teeth: It would be a civil offense to create or sell any kind of
    computer equipment that "does not include and utilize certified
    security technologies" approved by the federal government.
    It also creates new federal felonies, punishable by five years in
    prison and fines of up to $500,000. Anyone who distributes copyrighted
    material with "security measures" disabled or has a network-attached
    computer that disables copy protection is covered.
    Hollings' draft bill, which Wired News obtained on Friday, represents
    the next round of the ongoing legal tussle between content holders and
    their opponents, including librarians, programmers and open-source
    advocates.

Congress Mulls Stiff Crypto Laws
    By Declan McCullagh (declan at wired.com)
    1:45 p.m. Sep. 13, 2001 PDT
    WASHINGTON -- The encryption wars have begun.
    For nearly a decade, privacy mavens have been worrying that a
    terrorist attack could prompt Congress to ban
    communications-scrambling products that frustrate both police wiretaps
    and U.S. intelligence agencies.
    Tuesday's catastrophe, which shed more blood on American soil than any
    event since the Civil War, appears to have started that process.
    Some politicians and defense hawks are warning that extremists such as
    Osama bin Laden, who U.S. officials say is a crypto-aficionado and the
    top suspect in Tuesday's attacks, enjoy unfettered access to
    privacy-protecting software and hardware that render their
    communications unintelligible to eavesdroppers.
    In a floor speech on Thursday, Sen. Judd Gregg (R-New Hampshire)
    called for a global prohibition on encryption products without
    backdoors for government surveillance.
    "This is something that we need international cooperation on and we
    need to have movement on in order to get the information that allows
    us to anticipate and prevent what occurred in New York and in
    Washington," Gregg said, according to a copy of his remarks that an
    aide provided.
    President Clinton appointed an ambassador-rank official, David Aaron,
    to try this approach, but eventually the administration abandoned the
    project.
    Gregg said encryption makers "have as much at risk as we have at risk
    as a nation, and they should understand that as a matter of
    citizenship, they have an obligation" to include decryption methods
    for government agents. Gregg, who previously headed the appropriations
    subcommittee overseeing the Justice Department, said that such access
    would only take place with "court oversight."

    Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy, a hawkish think tank
    that has won accolades from all recent Republican presidents, says
    that this week's terrorist attacks demonstrate the government must be
    able to penetrate communications it intercepts.
    "I'm certainly of the view that we need to let the U.S. government
    have access to encrypted material under appropriate circumstances and
    regulations," says Gaffney, an assistant secretary of defense under
    President Reagan.

I recognize that you may be going through a lot of mail, but the article is hardly "seriously misleading."
I made precisely the point you made myself (it doesn't appear that you read the article in its entirety, and based your comments on a brief excerpt):
Pardon me for not taking much comfort from your assurance that Carnivore and its progeny can be used "only in its pen register mode." The URLs to web pages I visit, which can include search terms, and the identities of the people with whom I correspond, are important items that many people would consider private enough to require a court order.
Also, as a seperate note, Senate Judiciary committee aides told me they believe the wording of the bill -- apparently hastily-drafted -- may cover content of the communications, not just origin-desination information. If they're not sure, and they've had a full day to read it, how can you be so remarkably positive your interpretation is correct?
And even if you think it's unobjectionable, these sorts of measures might well deserve full, reasoned debate rather than being rushed through late in the night during a national emergency, two days after a brutal terrorist attack, and attached to a spending bill. (The spending bill doesn't even take effect for weeks, so clearly we could wait until next week and, gasp, convene a hearing.) Senators were given just half an hour or so to read a complicated wiretap bill before a scheduled vote.
Senator Patrick Leahy, who chairs the Judiciary committee and is not known for exaggerating privacy threats, was concerned enough to denounce the bill on the Senate floor during the late-night debate. Here's what he said:
We can disagree about how concerned we should be about broader warantless surveillance powers -- one DC privacy group has already said this bill is the most disturbing change to wiretap laws since CALEA -- but dismissing concerns as "only pen register mode" seems a bit much.

Bush Bill Rewrites Spy Laws
    By Declan McCullagh (declan at wired.com)
    2:00 a.m. Sep. 19, 2001 PDT
    WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration will ask for more power to
    eavesdrop on phone calls, the Internet and voicemail messages,
    according to an outline of a bill obtained by Wired News.
    In response to last week's catastrophic terrorist attacks, President
    Bush plans to ask Congress to approve far-reaching legislation that
    rewrites U.S. laws dealing with electronic surveillance, immigration
    and support for terrorists.
    "We will call upon the Congress of the United States to enact these
    important anti-terrorism measures this week," Attorney General John
    Ashcroft said Monday. "We need these tools to fight the terrorism
    threat which exists in the United States, and we must meet that
    growing threat."
    According to the two-page outline -- which lacks key details and could
    change before it's sent to Capitol Hill -- police would be able to
    conduct more wiretaps and use the Carnivore surveillance system in
    more situations without court orders. That section of the bill appears
    to mirror an amendment the Senate approved last Thursday evening.
    No restrictions on encryption products, a prospect feared by some
    civil libertarians, appear in the outline.
    The bill hands prosecutors a courtroom edge, saying that accused
    terrorists should stay in jail by default, that detention of suspected
    terrorists is "mandatory," and that the Immigration and Naturalization
    Service will have more authority to kick immigrants suspected of being
    terrorists out of the United States.

Ottawa to try to freeze terrorist funds: Tougher rules and changes to criminal code expected to make it easier to track monies

OTTAWA -- Canada will move to follow the American lead and shut down funding for terrorists, Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions Jim Peterson said yesterday. [...]
Peterson said the government plans to adopt tough new weapons to combat the financing of terrorism, possibly through an omnibus bill. Among the possible measures is extending the system that combats money-laundering to tracking terrorist funds, he said. While Peterson said the new rules are almost ready and should be introduced soon, neither he nor Justice Minister Anne McLellan could pinpoint a date. [...]
McLellan said the legislation she is preparing will also deal with such issues as lawful access, encryption, decryption and electronic surveillance. [...] McLellan said she will meet with a number of European counterparts today and

   SafeWeb's Holes Contradict Claims
   By Declan McCullagh (declan at wired.com)
   12:35 p.m. Feb. 12, 2002 PST
   WASHINGTON -- SafeWeb's anonymous-surfing technology turns out not to
   be very safe after all.
   A pair of researchers has unearthed flaws in the CIA-funded product
   that contradict the company's claims of "complete privacy" and reveal
   the supposedly confidential information of customers.
   Founded in April 2000, SafeWeb marketed an advertising-supported
   service said to allow users to browse the Web anonymously. In
   interviews, SafeWeb CEO Jon Chun boasted that the technology had been
   "through the rigors of the CIA's stringent review process, which far
   exceeds those of the ordinary enterprise client."
   Citing the economic downturn, SafeWeb abandoned the free service in
   November 2001. It has licensed its anonymizing technology to another
   company, PrivaSec, which currently offers the service for free and
   plans to charge for it soon.
   In a paper (PDF) released on Tuesday, David Martin, a Boston
   University computer scientist, and Andrew Schulman of the Privacy
   Foundation say that SafeWeb's assertions were more hopeful than true.
   They say, and SafeWeb has acknowledged, that flaws in the company's
   architecture allow a website to use JavaScript to obtain the concealed
   Internet address of the visitor. Because of SafeWeb's centralized
   technology, that page can also download a browser's cookies and obtain
   copies of subsequent Web pages visited during that session.

This is especially relevant to the list for two reasons:

* The suit claims, as I note toward the end of my article, that two existing legal protections don't amount to much. First, it says that the Library of Congress' Oct. 2000 exemption for filtering software research doesn't cover publishing decryption code. Second, it says that the DMCA's reverse engineering exemption is too narrow to apply.
    ACLU lawsuit targets copyright law
    By Declan McCullagh
    July 25, 2002, 6:30 AM PT
    WASHINGTON--The American Civil Liberties Union plans to file a lawsuit
    on Thursday in an attempt to overturn key portions of a controversial
    1998 copyright law.
    The suit asks a federal judge to rule that the Digital Millennium
    Copyright Act (DMCA) is so sweeping that it unconstitutionally
    interferes with researchers' ability to evaluate the effectiveness of
    Internet filtering software.
    By suing on behalf of a 22-year-old programmer who's researching the
    oft-buggy products, the civil liberties group hopes to prompt the
    first ruling that would curtail the DMCA's wide reach.
    After the DMCA was used to intimidate Princeton professor Ed Felten
    and his colleagues into self-censoring a presentation last year, the
    law became an instant magnet for criticism. But so far, every judge
    has upheld the DMCA's broad restrictions on the "circumvention of
    copyright protection systems."
    This case will be different, the ACLU hopes, because it features a
    sympathetic plaintiff, Ben Edelman, and because it involves the
    socially beneficial act of critiquing software that is frequently used
    in public schools and libraries. Edelman had testified as an expert
    witness in a case the ACLU brought against a federal law that
    compelled public libraries to install filters.

@_subject: Preliminary thoughts on Zero Knowledge's planned public offering 
Zero Knowledge's prospectus posted on the sedar.com site offers up an unprecedented look at the financials of the company. I just read it; here are some preliminary notes:
* For the fiscal year June 30, 2000 to June 30, 2001, ZKS made Can$1 million in revenue. They lost Can$36 million.
* In U.S. dollars, that's $650,000 revenue -- and a loss of $24 million.
* After layoffs, from the nine months ending March 30, 2002 (the most recent numbers), the company made Can$1.7 million in revenue. But the net loss was still Can$20 million.
* During the height of the Freedom product, revenue was only $400K/year in software licenses.
* ZKS has leased (mostly in a 10-year lease) about 44,000 square feet of
office space in Montreal. At only 81 current employees, that's 543 sq-feet/employee -- enough for a comfortable studio apartment for each person. Only 4,000 square feet have been sublet. A football field, by comparison, is about 50,000 square feet.
* Cash reserves are dwindling fast. As of June 30, 2001, ZKS had Can$15 million in the bank. Now they have only Can$3 million.
* The company's current burn rate is almost, according to statement F-3, as much as Can$2 million a month. Without a substantial revenue uptick or a short-term loan, ZKS could simply run out of cash. To be fair, some of that revenue could come in with new deals with HP and other companies described in the prospectus.
* Can$1.3 million/year of remaining cash will be eaten up by four fat executive salaries that remain hefty, even given the dismal financial situation. Each of the three Hill family members gets Can$270K a year, with the CEO receiving Can$470K.
* If my calculations are correct, and barring a cash infusion from licensing, soon ZKS' liabilities, such as accounts payable and long-term debt, will be more than the company's assets.
Question: Given the above, what's the future of an IPO? (Keep in mind that ZKS had also planned an abortive IPO in 2000.)
Here's the prospectus:

set the legal hurdles for online search warrants high enough so that
governments cannot abuse their power. But at the same time to keep them low
enough so that criminals can be found and stopped. In this respect, the
online world should be no different from the real one.
It's not an inaccurate quote, but it is taken out of context.
What I said was that the trend in our laws was to destroy any privacy at all -- that the idiocy of Patriot Acts, etc., was effectively eliminating any form of privacy. There are two kinds of responses to this -- one to try to defend and build a system protecting absolute anonymity; the second is to build effective protections for pseudonymous life, which is shorthand for traceable transactions, but where the permission to trace is protected by something like a warrant requirement. I'm not saying the government should build these systems, but that they should be permitted and indeed In my view, we will make no progress following path one, but that we would strongly advance privacy if we could advance path two. A strong ethic and architecture of pseudonymous identity, properly protected, would give us more privacy than we have today.
Of course, it is possible (and probably likely) that such an architecture would not properly protect the link between a transaction and the privacy of a person. Government officials, for example, upon mere suspicion would be able to break the link, etc. That of course is not what I am promoting. I would promote a regime where the gov't required a very strong warrant-like reason before it could break the code that makes the link. But I will not that the baseline from which we're starting is a world where no real showing is necessary for this sort of surveillance.

     [Why do I get the feeling that Larry Lessig doesn't like "absolute" anonymity much at all? Systems for building and defending "absolute" anonymity already exist in the form of anonymous remailers and Freenet, among others. It would be foolish to follow Larry's advice and concede too quickly that such technologies have so few legitimate uses that they cannot be reasonably defended. Even the oft-benighted Eurocrats have recognized this: a 1997 EC directive encourages anonymity, as does a German federal law ( In the U.S., since the Federalist Papers were published with effectively "absolute" pseudonymity, surely the framers of the U.S. Constitution had them in mind when crafting the Bill of Rights. Justice Thomas lists more contemporaneous examples in his McIntyre concurrence ( Saying anonymous technologies are indefensible concedes a crucial point: that the government's power is so sweeping that police have the right to learn our identity in all cases. So much for whistleblowing and anonymous reports of public brutality.
Perhaps more to the point, the twin privacy-encroaching technologies of automated electronic surveillance and efficient large-scale databases did not exist decades or centuries ago. "Absolute" anonymity lets us reclaim some of that lost zone of privacy. Lastly, trying to remove "absolute" anonymity from the Internet (banning strong encryption and computers that can be programmed not to keep logs) would be far more disruptive, destructive, and harmful than proposals like Hollings' CBDTPA that Larry has rightly opposed. --Declan]

Here's the old SAFE Act:
Thanks to Joe for being the first one to submit this... Here's a duplicate URL if the original is too slow:
Note the draft legislation creates a new federal felony of willfully using encryption in the commission of a felony. "No more than five years" in prison plus a hefty fine. This seems at first glance to be remarkably similar to what was in the SAFE bill years ago. Here's a Politech message from 1998, before the politechbot.com archives:
Question: When encryption is omnipresent in everything from wireless networks to hard drives to SSH clients, might the basic effect of such a law be to boost potential maximum prison terms by five years?
Second question: Peer-to-peer piracy is arguably a federal felony under the NET Act. If a future peer-to-peer network uses encryption (as it should), does that mean that copyright-infringing users would be guilty of a double That's just one section of a 120-page bill. The rest is worth reading.

Justice Department Drafts Sweeping Expansion of Anti-Terrorism Act
Center Publishes Secret Draft of 'Patriot II' Legislation
The Bush Administration is preparing a bold, comprehensive sequel to
the USA Patriot Act that will give the government broad, sweeping new
powers to increase domestic intelligence-gathering, surveillance and
law enforcement prerogatives, and simultaneously decrease judicial
review and public access to information. The Center for Public
Integrity has obtained a draft, dated January 9, 2003, of this
previously undisclosed legislation and is making it available in full
text. The bill, drafted by the staff of Attorney General John Ashcroft
and entitled the Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003, has not
been officially released by the Department of Justice, although rumors
of its development have circulated around the Capitol.

I have a news analysis up at News.com that, perhaps, may shed some
light on what's actually going on:

@_subject: Verizon must comply with RIAA's DMCA subpoena 
I was thinking along the same lines. This seems to be a market opportunity for an Internet provider that keeps no IP address<->identity records for more than a few minutes or hours.
The DMCA subpoena process requires that a copyright holder contact "the clerk of any United States district court (for) a subpoena to a service provider." There's a hint in the law (digital signatures) that this can be done electronically, but I presume there's still a delay.
Unfortunately, those details aren't in the court record. If RIAA ever files suit against a p2p user (which they have never done to date, to the best of my knowledge), we'd find out. I asked RIAA today about their plans to sue individuals -- they're breaking the law, right? -- and they wouldn't talk.
Still, we shouldn't overlook the obvious: It doesn't need to be anything as advanced as monitoring; it could be a tip from an informant at a university computer lab... Or a corporate administrator who tipped RIAA off in hopes of thwarting a lawsuit...
My understanding of Kazaa is that it's easy enough to find out who is distributing files and what those files are. That doesn't answer your questions about identifying who's accumulating them, though.

@_subject: A Trial Balloon to Ban Email? 
Greg is right, and raises a point I hadn't considered before. But then
again if I charge $.25 to send me mail in a hypothetical micropayment
system (and I'd hope a social custom would arise making it tacky to
retain the money if the mail were not spam), I'd be happy to let
everyone know I have a working email address.

@_subject: A Trial Balloon to Ban Email? 
It is true that the notions of micropayments as applied to spam (that I'm familiar with, at least) would require that the email recipient check with the bank to detect doublespending. This would introduce an additional delay before delivery from unknown senders, yes, but I fail to see how it would impose an unacceptable cost in bandwidth or CPU usage.
Spammers could still try the same-micropayment-a-million-times route, just as they could try to spam without micropayments, but if their email is rejected in sufficient quantities, the cost to the spammer would outweigh the benefits. The key is achieving sufficient quantities.
