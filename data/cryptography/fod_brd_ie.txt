@_subject: Paper: Feasibility of attacking Windows 2000 Kerberos Passwords 
I have uploaded a paper on the feasibility of dictionary attacking/brute
forcing Windows 2000 Kerberos passwords that may be of general interest.
The vulnerability will probably not be news to anyone here, but as far as I
am aware this has not received much public discussion in the context of W2K.
