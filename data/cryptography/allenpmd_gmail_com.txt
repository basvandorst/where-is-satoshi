@_subject: [Cryptography] More efficient and just as secure to sign message 
According to the Ed25519 paper, the (potentially long) input message is
hashed twice (see  Section 4
page 12 steps 1 and 3). The webpage
 has a nice diagram
toward the bottom that illustrates this, and I confirmed it in the reference
code on Supercop (see supercop-20141124/crypto_sign/ed25519/ref/sign.c,
function calls crypto_hash_sha512(nonce, sm+32, mlen+32) and
crypto_hash_sha512(hram, sm, mlen + 64)).
My question is, for long messages, wouldn't it be more efficient and just as
secure to hash the entire message just once, and then use the 64 byte hash
as the input to the signing algorithm? In other words, the code would look
crypto_hash_sha512(mhash, m, mlen);
crypto_sign(output, mhash, 64, key);
The would seem to me to be faster for mlen > approx 128 bytes without any
loss of security.
I'm I missing something here? Is there a potential loss of security to using
mhash as the signing input instead of the original message m?

only had one. ... Almost certainly the least of your worries in any
real-world application.
I see it basically the same way.  Performing two full hashes of the message
seems to buy only a very small marginal security benefit (maybe something on
the order of 1 additional bit of security in the overall scheme?).  Even if
I thought the additional computational/probabilistic security were needed, I
could probably find a way to use those CPU cycles that would yield a better
payoff (using a stronger curve or a more complicated hash function
perhaps?).  I'm comfortable signing the hash(message) rather than the
message itself.

I think for my application I'm going to end up signing a short input that consists of the concatenation of (the 512 bit hash of the message || the length of the message || a few small values that in my application tie the message to its context).  In theory, the extra values aren't necessary, but it is a low cost way to harden the algorithm slightly and counter the potential perception that I took a shortcut in implementing the Ed25519 algorithm.

Who claimed there is "no added robustness"?  It certainly wasn't me.  I specifically said there was a very small marginal benefit, but that I thought it was not the best use of the resources required.
It would also be more conservative to use five different 1024-bit hash functions in parallel and to sign messages twelve times using RSA, DSA, ECDSA and EdDSA with various curves and key lengths.  But it's not our job to be as conservative as possible without considering the costs and benefits.
You are correct that I believe the double-hashing in Ed25519 design is overly conservative for many application.   I also think that in some if not many cases the additional CPU cycles required to hash the full message twice could be put to other uses that would give a better security payoff.

Would hashing twice with MD5 be the best way to prevent that attack, or might it be better to use a stronger hash function?

Hi Peter,
I understand what you are saying.  Regardless of how the two hashes are used
internally, at the end of the day, the algorithm is hashing the entire
message twice (with the same hash algorithm and two different IV's), and the
potential advantage over hashing just once is that you gain resistance to
collisions in the hash function.
Hashing an entire message twice with two different IV's is a simple way to
gain collision resistance in any context, but I also think it is relatively
expensive compared to other potential approaches.
This is the approach we're considering for our application, and I would
suggest it might also be suitable for other applications with long messages:
1. Hash the entire message once using a hash function that outputs at least
512 bits.  If you want fast, Skein-512-512, Blake-512 or Blake2b might be
good choices.  If you want more security and/or collision resistance,
Keccak-512 or Keccak-576 might be good choices.
2. Form a short string by concatenating the hash computed in Step 1 with the
original message length and other key message metadata, such as the message
id, timestamp, sender id, reply-to id, etc.
3. Sign the short string from Step 2 using the Ed25519 algorithm as
published, pairing the elliptic curve with a strong 512 bit hash function
such as Keccak-512, or possibly even two strong hash functions such as the
Depending on the application and the nature of the messages being signed, I
think that sufficiently strengthens the algorithm against potential
collisions in the hash function without requiring the entire (long) message
to be hashed twice.  It also opens up the possibility of using a faster
and/or wider hash function in Step 1, with a more computationally complex
hash function in Step 3, which I think puts the CPU cycles to work where
they can provide the greatest benefit.
Just my 2 cents.  Other people might have different security/cost tradeoffs,
which is fine by me.

P.S, I might add that for many applications it would be good to include:
Step 0.  A pseudo-random nonce is generated and appended to the message.
This step would go a long way toward thwarting chosen message attacks, and
is a good defense measure in any signature scheme.

I didn't look up the cases in PACER but the paperwork looks real.  It
alleges infringement of Claim 1 in
A method is provided for an escrow cryptosystem that is overhead-free, does
not require a cryptographic tamper-proof hardware implementation (i.e., can
be done in software), is publicly verifiable, and cannot be used
subliminally to enable a shadow public key system. A shadow public key
system is an unescrowed public key system that is publicly displayed in a
covert fashion. The key generated by the method are auto-recoverable and
auto-certifiable (abbrev. ARC). The ARC Cryptosystem is based on a key
generation mechanism that outputs a public/private key pair, and a
certificate of proof that the key was generated according to the algorithm.
Each generated public/private key pair can be verified efficiently to be
escrowed properly by anyone. The verification procedure does not use the
private key. Hence, the general public has an efficient way of making sure
that any given individual's private key is escrowed properly, and the
trusted authorities will be able to access the private key if needed. Since
the verification can be performed by anyone, there is no need for a special
trusted entity, known in the art as a “trusted third party”. The
cryptosystem is overhead free since there is no additional protocol
interaction between the user who generates his or her own key, and the
certification authority or the escrow authorities, in comparison to what is
required to submit the public key itself in regular certified public key
systems. Furthermore, the system is designed so that its internals can be
made publicly scrutinizable (e.g., it can be distributed in source code
form). This differs from many schemes which require that the escrowing
device be tamper-proof hardware.
What we claim is:
1. A method and apparatus for generating public keys and a proof that the
keys were generated by a specific algorithm comprising the steps of:
- the user's system generating a random string of bits based on system
- the user running a key generation algorithm to get a secret key and
public key using the random string and public parameters;
- the user constructing a proof being a string of bits whose public
availability does not compromise the secret key and wherein said
constructing of said proof requires access to said secret key, but at the
same time said proof provides confidence to at least one of a plurality of
other entities that said public key was generated properly by the specified
algorithm, and wherein said confidence is gained without having access to
any portion of said secret key.

As I mentioned, these things are defined in 15 CFR Part 774.  From my
understanding, the gist of it is: if the software attempts to hide data to
keep it private, then it is classified as encryption software, subject to
some exceptions for certain uses and short key lengths, etc..  If it only
contains data assurance algorithms, like checksums, hashes, signatures,
etc, without hiding any of the data contents, and it is not modifiable by
the user, and probably a lot more and's, then it is not encryption
software.  If the code you just posted is applying a one-time-pad or
something similar, then I believe it would be classified as encryption
software.  I believe it might be possible to submit a "classification
request" if there is any uncertainty.  Note however that if your goal is

Not so easy though if all honest participants use a signing key only once,
publishing a new public signing key and overwriting the old private key
each time they sign a block.  Once the old private key is overwritten, it's
impossible to revise the history (except to rewrite it completely by
changing the software to accept a different genesis block, which I think
would be possible with any blockchain).

Actually, with PoW, there is no guarantee--there is just a probabilistic
property subject to certain assumptions about computing resources and how
they are expended.  In fact, even if the miners are honest at the time,
later miners can go back and rewrite the blockchain at any time by creating
a higher cumulative PoW.  Conversely, with block signing and key rotation,
you do get a guarantee--if a majority of the miners are honest at the time
and overwrite their private signing key after each block, that does
guarantee the block is permanent and can never be revised.  Note that
neither system (and I believe no system) is going to work if a majority of
miners are dishonest, so I don't think that assumption places a higher
burden on either system.

This is where the battle is really headed--not whether Apple or any other
device/software manufacturer should be compelled to hack into a hackable
phone (which I called Issue A on another thread).  That can be solved by
technology that makes the device/software "unhackable".
The real battle is in whether a device/software manufacturer can be forced
to backdoor or root a targeted user (what I called Issue B), or backdoor
all devices (what I called Issue C).

@_subject: [Cryptography] The All Writs Act 
The DOJ wrote a pretty good motion to compel:
As pointed out by Ars Technica, in other cases, the All Writs Act has been
used to force parties to provide access to facilities they controlled, for
example, the phone company has been ordered to provide access to the
switches it owns and controls:
The difference in this case is that Apple does not own or control the
subject iPhone.  As pointed out by the DOJ though, Apple does own the
software running on the phone (it is copyright Apple and licensed, not
sold) and controls the software the phone runs by requiring Apple's
cryptographic signature on any software loaded onto the phone.
So it seems to me there is a good chance the DOJ will win on this motion,
and in fact, the All Writs Act might in the future be used to force Apple,
Microsoft or any other software to root or plant spyware on a user's device
if the manufacturer retains that capability, whether it is through a
software update system or otherwise.  The only thing that would stop this
is an act of Congress forbidding the use of the All Writs Act to force the
installation of a backdoor.  That seem unlikely, so it looks like the DOJ
is about to get through the All Writs Act an ability to was not able to get
through Congressional action.
It seems to me the only way to get around this is for software manufacturer
to give up any ability to control what software the device runs, including
auto-update, or alternatively, to place control under a process that is not
susceptible to government-ordered spyware.  For example, the open source
model can be resistant, depending on how it is implemented.  Or it might be
possible to require updates to be signed by an organization that resides
entirely within a legal jurisdiction that does not allow secret
government-ordered spyware, but of course, that organization would also
need to have some way of auditing the contents of the update.

@_subject: [Cryptography] eliminating manufacturer's ability to backdoor users 
Yesterday I was thinking about ways to prevent the All Writs Act from being
used to force a manufacturer to plant spyware on a targeted device that is
being actively used by a targeted user.  Note this is different than the
current Apple situation: the current situation asks Apple to hack a device
that is not being used.  My concern is with the government or a court
forcing a manufacturer to use an auto-update or software distribution
mechanism to plant spyware on a targeted device.
Some people might question why anyone would want to do this, but some
obvious examples are to prevent a government from abusing its power by
targeting political dissidents or otherwise violating human rights.
I came up with two potential ways to prevent this:
1. The open source model, which if properly implemented can help users
audit the software being installed on their device.
2. Requiring software to be signed by an organization that resides entirely
within a legal jurisdiction that does not allow secret government-ordered
spyware while providing the signing organization with a way to audit the
contents of the software.
I have a third potential method:
3. Distribute updates completely anonymously: the device would not connect
to the manufacturer's website and identify itself either by transmitting an
id or connecting from a monitored ip address or connecting in a way that an
identification tag can be inserted into the stream by a proxy device.
Instead, the device would connect completely anonymously.  One method would
be to allow signed updates to be distributed to mirrors all over the world,
and allow users to pick their mirrors.  Another or additional step would be
to allow users to connect and download updates from the mirrors using tor.
In order for this to work however, the update software and the software
that is installed would have to be forbidden from accessing any identifying
information on the device, otherwise, the government might be able to force
the manufacturer to deliver a spyware payload to all devices but only
install or activate the spyware if the device matches an identity check;
essentially, this would be a backdoor on all devices that the government
could force to be activated on only targeted devices.
I'm thinking that a combination of 1 (open source) with the first part of 3
(anonymous distribution) would be most effective.
Anyone else have ideas?

Apple is fighting a losing fight, and in my opinion, the wrong fight
because they are putting the larger battle at risk.  As long as
manufacturers like Apple insist on controlling the keys to the phone, they
will be required open it when subject to a warrant.  The only fight left
then will be to prevent every phone from being backdoor'ed so a warrant is

My thought that the hardware had to be non-identifiable only applied when
the hardware manufacturer could potentially be ordered to secretly install
spyware on a targeted machine.
The best solution I can come up with at the moment is the open source model
that allows everyone to audit what is being installed, combined with
binaries that are built using a repeatable process and signed by trusted
persons in a jurisdiction that doesn't permit government-ordered back doors.
I also think that in the long run law enforcement will succeed in getting
CALEA type laws passed that cover a wide variety of encryption, and force
technology providers to escrow keys for all encryption products.  The only
solution to that problem I think is open source.  At minimum, the best way
to deter adoption of a CALEA type law is to ensure everyone has other
alternatives so that the law would be ineffective, and that again points
toward open source.
I realize that is still susceptible to unintentional security
vulnerabilities and to back doors inserted into unauditable components such

Government-mandated back doors are the norm in the USA.  The law is known
as CALEA and at the moment it applies only to telecommunication providers.
But don't fool yourself, if the DOJ/FBI loses this case in court, Congress
will step in and pass the equivalent of CALEA for technology providers, and
it will be much, much worse than what the DOJ/FBI is asking for here. It
will probably mandate key escrow for all encryption so law enforcement can
easily decode everything.
That is why it is a mistake for Apple to contest the order.  There is
simply no way they are going to win, and by drawing attention to this
problem, they are only going to spur Congress into taking action that will
have an even worse result.
IMO, the best protection is going to be found in technology, and how it is

AFAICS, the protocol you proposed is incomplete because it does not include
a verification protocol.  In other words, if you look up a digital
signature protocol, you will in fact see two protocols, one protocol that
lists a set of inputs and outputs to sign a message, and a second that
lists a set of inputs and a procedure to verify a signed message.  Your
proposal is missing the set of inputs and procedure that a third party
could use to verify that the contract has been accepted by both parties.

The protocol does not define a verification procedure that can be used to

On Fri, Jun 24, 2016 at 5:51 PM, mok-kong shen Using this definition of validity "what Alice in step 3 produces", the
protocol is pretty obviously "unfair".  In Step 3, Alice creates and
publishes signed(Alice,Y).  She can create and publish this at her
option--if she does, a valid contract suddenly comes into existence, and if
she does not, there is no valid contact.  Therefore, the creation of the
valid contract is completely under Alice's control at this point, and
completely out of Bob's control.

I read what you specifically said constitutes a valid contract: the
published outputs from Step 3.  Now you want to amend your definition to
say that Step 1 constitutes an enforceable "promise" by Alice?  Under your
amended definition, if Step 1 constitutes an enforceable "promise", then
after Step 1, only Alice is bound and Bob is not.  That is pretty clearly
an unfair protocol.
and incomplete.  I personally believe that any effort to complete the
protocol by making it specific, unambiguous and complete will simply
demonstrate that, without relying on a third party, it is not possible to
construct a "fair" protocol in the sense that no party is bound while the
other is not, that at no time does the completion of the contract depend on
the action of only one party which he or she may defer or fail to complete,
and that at all times when a valid contract exists, both parties are
equally able to enforce it.  If you would like to repost the entire
proposed protocol, making it 100% specific, unambiguous and complete, with
every single condition or combination of conditions that constitute a valid
contract fully specified, including all inputs and complete abbreviated
tests for validity, then I'll look at it one more time.  But please make
sure it complete, fully specified and works as advertised.

As you stated previously, Alice's "promise" is enforceable in court by Bob,
so as soon as Alice sends her promise, she is bound while Bob is not, and
therefore the protocol fails any reasonable definition of "fairness".
Also note that to the extent your protocol depends on "time", i.e., that
actions must be taken within a certain time, a third party notary would be
required to certify the timestamps, since it is not possible for the
parties to do this themselves.
Finally, the protocol is still insufficiently specified IMO, in that it
does not include a clear and complete discussion of all the different
scenarios and conditions that can arise during the execution of the
protocol and how those would be handled.
I think this thread has run its course and no further discussion would be

While you're reading the EFF brief, also read the cited cases (which I have

law.  There are in fact few precedents (i.e., it is far from "long
settled"), the cases are fact-specific (not generalized to all computer
code, as the EFF brief claims), there are no prior cases dealing with
Apple’s iOS operating system, and finally, the weight of the case law
distinguishes between expressive speech (which is protected) and activities
like building a non-expressive machine which are neither speech nor
protected.  The EFF does not have a strong brief, IMO.  Mischaracterizing
the law is not likely to get you very far in court.

here--it consists of whatever the courts say it does.  Just because
computer people use the term "digital signature" does not make it a true

In all these examples, you are asking if the court can order you to sign
something that is published.  In this case, Apple is being asked to "sign"
code that will not be published and is not speech.  That is a huge
distinction.  Second, the court can order you to provide your signature if
they need a signature sample to validate a document.  Your signature in
that case is not considered an endorsement under the law, nor would it be
in this case.  Third, the "signature" that Apple would have to apply acts
like a lock that opens a safe.  In other words, the "signature" is a
technological control.  So the question is, can the court order you to
unlock a safe?  The answer is yes.  If we renamed "sign" to "unlock", would
that make you feel better about it?  Because that in reality is what is
happening.  Apple is being ask to unlock the device so the code will run on
it.  It should be noted that the computer industry created this new use for
the existing words "sign" and "signature".  Just because we call it "sign"
and "signature" does not make it the same a a legal signature. i.e., a
personal endorsement or form of speech, nor should the courts recognize
them as such in every case.  Whether it is a legal signature, an
endorsement or speech depends on the specific context and facts of the
case.  In this case, Apple is not in fact being asked to provide a legal
signature, they are just being asked to unlock the device.  I'm in favor of
Apple's position, but the free speech arguments don't hold up to scrutiny.

First, the “signature” at issue in this case is simply a numeric value that
computer scientists have decided to call a “digital signature”.  Despite
the same name, it might not be a legal signature at all in the way it is

and the court issued a search warrant for the safe, there would be no
question the court could order the owner of the safe to unlock it using the
combination.  A company might also build a safe with a signature-controlled
lock.  For this type of safe, the owner might have to use a stylus to write
their signature on an entry pad, and upon detecting the correct signature,
the safe would unlock.  There would again be no question the court could
order the owner of that safe to use the stylus to write their signature and
unlock the safe.  Finally, a company might build a “smart safe”, where the
owner could write both a person’s name and then a signature, and the safe
would then unlock only for the identified person.  There would again no
question the court could order the owner to use the stylus to write “FBI”
and their signature to unlock the safe for the FBI.  There is nothing
expressive about the unpublished "signature" that Apple is being asked to
provide in this case.  It is simply a numeric code that opens a "smart
I am in favor of Apple prevailing in this case (on other grounds), but I
see no merit to the First Amendment claims.
Now, with all that said, if Apple wanted to strengthen its position for
future cases, instead of signing the code, it could include with the code a
declaration that read "I, Apple Corporation, do hereby affirm under penalty
of perjury that the attached code which hashes to the value
0x746547493947363748 was prepared by and is endorsed by this Corporation to

look for the signed affirmation rather than just the signed code.  That
might get you over in a future case, but to make the argument now that the
current digital unlock code is equivalent to an affirmation or endorsement
might only diminish the chance of that working in the future.

of following the Ed25519 spec to compute the nonce deterministically from

verify; (b) the signature produced with a random nonce will be "malleable",

there is no way for a verifier (i.e., anyone who does not know the signer's
secret key) to tell if the signer followed the Ed25519 spec or used a
random nonce.  Of course, (a) and (b) could be tested fairly quickly by

therefore it does not "interfere" with radio communication.

No, as explained, the term "interfere" as used in that section of the
US Code requires the emission of radio frequency energy.

Those two sections are in the same part of the Code and have the same
subject matter.  Lessons on interpreting the US Code are beyond the
scope of this list, but if you want to dip your toes into it, there
are many references available.

All you need to prevent MiTM attacks is a MAC that uses a preshared
secret key to authenticate the messages, and include the value of a
counter with each message to prevent message replay.  I think you
should be able to find a suitable MAC based on a hash function that
can be implemented in a constrained environment.

I could probably think of at least 20 ways if I spent 10 minutes
thinking about this.  The device could come with printed QR code that
contained the secret key; the device could have a label with a short
password that when entered into the app causes the device to transmit
the preshared key to the app (and of course, if the wrong password is
entered 10 times, the device goes offline for an hour, etc.); the QR
code or short password could instead lookup the secret key from an
https internet database or there is no possibility of someone stealing
the key from the radio transmission; the user has to register the
device and the website gives them the preshared key during
registration, etc...  I'm sure there are many more ways to do this--it
depends on the requirements of your app...

I'm glad to hear that in your experience it is almost inconceivable
that someone is unable to pay their electric bill, but in the real
world, this happens all the time.
Here for example are residential disconnect stats for Australia
And here's a table that says the State of Iowa has about 6000
involuntary disconnects per months.
I'm sure similar stats are available for other jurisdictions if you
start looking.

The whitepaper is at
The whitepaper does not even come close to completely and
unambiguously specifying the encryption scheme, so any analysis at
this stage would be pretty speculative.

I think the scheme is closer to this:
Mi = sequence of message bits
Ri = sequence of random bits
Pi = sequence of bits from PRNG keyed by key K
The encoder transmits Mi xor Ri, and Ri xor Pi.  The decoder generates
Pi and recovers
Mi = (Mi xor Ri) xor ((Ri xor Pi) xor Pi)
But its certainly not clear from the whitepaper.

I simplified some--the scheme may use something more complicated than
an XOR, something like reversibly mixing bits in blocks (as in a block
cipher)--it's not at all clear though from the whitepaper.
Fundamentally, this scheme may be equivalent to a block or stream
cipher with a random IV that is the same length as the message.

An interesting corollary it seems to me (which is probably not new,
but is new to me), is that if you encode a message containing Em bits
of "entropy" using a key that has Ek bits of "entropy", and then
transmit it across a public channel, the resulting message has Ek bits
of "entropy", not Em bits of entropy, since the Em bits of entropy are
revealed to to the world when the message is transmitted and all that
is left is the Ek bits of entropy in the key.  This would also
indicate that one of the key claims in the perpetual encryption
whitepaper--that the entropy is increased by mixing with the random
data and therefore the scheme 2^X times stronger than any other
encryption scheme--is incorrect because the entropy remaining in the
transmitted message cannot be greater than the entropy of the key or
initial secret PRNG state needed to decrypt the message.

Are you referring to the idea of hackers remotely compromising a bunch

Are there other methods to circumvent PoW (in the context of spam), or
is that it?

yes, I read the 9 page paper by Laurie and Clayton that you
referenced, and the only attack I could see to circumvent PoW
discussed in that paper was to remotely compromise computers and use
them to compute PoW.  But you said Laurie and Clayton "hammered stakes
through it" (stakes plural, not just one stake), plus their paper came
much later than the comment by Dwork, so if Dwork had the same idea,
I'm not sure why you credited Laurie and Clayton for "hammered stakes
through it" when Dwork acknowledged an attack much earlier.  So I'm
trying to understand if I missed something, not in terms of who should
get credit for the attacks, but if there are other attacks out there
that I missed.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Quantum computers will never overcome noise 
Interestingly, researchers at Oxford have just reported creating a
quantum gate with a record breaking precision of 99.9%.  My
understanding is that it therefore generates the wrong result with a
probability of 0.001.
      I went back and compared this with an estimate of the number of
quantum gates required to break elliptic curve encryption.
Researchers at Microsoft estimate that breaking P-256 would require
2330 qubits and 1.26E11 Toffoli gates.  See Table 2 on page 21 of
   Significantly I think, 1.16E11 of the Toffoli gates would sequential,
meaning the outputs of one gate would feed the inputs of the next.  At
an error rate of 0.001, the probability of error in 1.16E11 sequential
gates would be (1-0.001)^1.16E11 which is essentially 1, i.e., the
results would never be accurate.  In order to get even somewhat
accurate results with so many sequential gates, the error rate needs
to be roughly the same magnitude as the number of sequential gates, in
other words, with 1E11 sequential gates, we would need an error rate
below 1E-11, or roughly "11 nines" of precision.  My guess is that is
well below any noise floor that could be achieved in practice.
Do I understand correctly how the sequential gates and error rates
work?  Comments/corrections/feedback are welcome.  If I did understand
it correctly, then in order to break elliptic curve encryption, we
would need quantum algorithms where the number of sequential gates is
less than the error rate, which I'm guessing might be around 1E4 or
1E5.  I'm guessing there is also may be a tradeoff between the gate
depth and the number of gates and qubits, but it might be exponential,
in other words, you can half the gate depth if you square the number
of gates and qubits.  The relationship between the gate depth and
number of gates and qubits might prove to be a key determinant of
whether elliptic curve encryption can ever be broken using a quantum
computer.  Thoughts?
