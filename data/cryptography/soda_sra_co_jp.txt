I think this (2) is misunderstanding, or may lead misunderstand.
For example, i) of 3) describes that modifed part of the code
(i.e. modified since Sun's contribution) is not subject of the
covenant. But licensee who modifies Sun's code can covenant to Sun
about the unmodified part of the code.

The 3 terms may be considered as:
Otherwise, the term 3) ii) doesn't make sense.
The above claim about "don't modify Sun's code" is based on the
following term, right?
But if one cannot combine the contributed code with other software,
this contributed code doesn't make any sense.
Note this is library code, and the only way to use such function is to
combine it with other software.
