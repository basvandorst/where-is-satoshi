Plus, I'd remind everyone that no-one managed to prove that breaking
RSA is as hard as factoring (cf. ``Breaking RSA may be easier than
factoring'' D.Boneh & R.Venkatesan, where they show that if you manage
to show that breaking RSA is algebraically as hard as factoring,
then you've got for free a factoring algorithm).
