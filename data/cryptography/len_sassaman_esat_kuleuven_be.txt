@_subject: MD5 considered harmful today 
To insert a malicious "basicConstraints CA = TRUE" these advances appear
necessary; I do not believe that they are necessary for the other very
similar attack (where the malicious cert is a wildcard (*) certificate). I
could be wrong about this, but I also don't think that the advances in
cryptography to get from chosen prefix attacks to here are anywhere near
as great as were needed to get the original chosen prefix work. We can
evaluate the correctness of that statement when the work is published, of
Prof. Lenstra's PlayStation Lab is definitely impressive, but there are
many ways to get the computation time needed to perform this attack,
including Amazon's EC2, botnets, and other high powered computing systems.
It's not *that* much computation time.
I am worried that this may be too optimistic of an outlook. This attack
was known and discussed by at least two research teams for at least a year
(Dan Kaminsky, Meredith L. Patterson, and I worked out the attack at the
last CCC).
To be fully confident in the CA infrastructure, all certificates that have
delegated signing authority granted to them by a higher CA (using MD5 on
the certificate in question) should be audited to ensure they are not
malicious. This of course includes private certificate infrastructures,
I would be extremely surprised if this attack had been performed prior to
the original chosen prefix work being published -- but since that time,
there has been plenty of opportunity for a malicious party to quietly
perform this attack in the wild.
