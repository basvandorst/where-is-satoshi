It sounds like you're describing the F2F structure underlying the
Retroshare network (though it does piggyback atop the BitTorrent DHT
as a shortcut for peer finding).  However, Retroshare has evidenced
some significant problems on Windows as a platform, and UPnP for
automatic port forwarding is dodgy at the best because not every home
router out there supports it correctly (or at all).

What is considered acceptible latency these days for IM or e-mail?
Supposedly, the highest acceptible latency for web browsing before the
user gets bored and closes the tab is two or three seconds
(supposedly...), so where would the lag for e-mail or IM fall anymore
before users give up on it?
That is a serious question, by the bye.  People's standands of what is
and is not acceptible effort and speed seems very skewed to geek
standards these days.  If those figures for web browsing are accurate,
and if two clicks to start the TBB really are too much for people
today... realistically speaking, what would be required to make secure
communication apps worth it for many people?

this is already happening under a different context.

Hash: SHA1
There may be limits to how far they've deployed PFS on their
user-facing services around the world at this time.  I just accessed
encrypted.google.com and Gmail from home, and here's what the Calomel
SSL Validation add-on for Firefox (with HTTPS Finder and
HTTPS-Everywhere, verified manually) and is telling me:
Symmetric cipher RC4 (weak 10/49)
Symmetric key length 128 bits (weak 8/19)
Cert issued by Google, Inc, US SHA-1 with RSA @ 2048 bit (MODERATE 2/6)
Manually keying  into my browser returned the
same thing.
Gmail shows me this:
Symmetric cipher RC4 (weak 10/39)
Symmetric key length 128 bits (weak 8/19)
Cert issued by Google, Inc, US SHA-1 with RSA @ 2048 bit (MODERATE 2/6)
 is returning the same as Gmail.
Let's contrast this with ChaosPad:
Symmetric cipher Camellia (STRONG 39/39)
Symmetric key length 256 bits (STRONG 19/19)
Cert issued by CAcert, Inc. SHA-1 with RSA @ 4096 bit (MODERATE 2/6)
I'd be very interested in what other people see where they are.
Alternatively, my browser's SSL/TLS configuration could be hosed, in
which case I'm completely off base and probably need to torch my
browser profile and start over.

When faced with this, Project Byzantium contacted the Electronic Frontier Foundation and worked out what did and did not need to be done with one of their subject matter experts.  We then moved forward from there.
I am not a lawyer.  This is not legal advice.  Get your own lawyer.  This is only what Byzantium did:
Due to the fact that we did not write our own crypto code (we used OpenSSL and applications which relied upon OpenSSL) we did not need to do this.  The advice we were given was that, due to the fact that we did not write crypto code of our own, and we were using someone else's that had been packaged by yet someone else (two someone elses, actually - from Slackware to Porteus Linux to us, the code did flow) this set of regulations did not apply to our project.
Your mileage will probably vary.  Get a lawyer.

That is absolutely correct.
The reason we asked legal counsel for guidance is because none of us are lawyers.  Due to the fact that we linked a bunch of stuff against OpenSSL, and would be distributing a Linux distribution that incorporated OpenSSL on an international basis, we wanted to avoid as much legal trouble as possible.  To put it another way, we didn't want to risk going to jail because we did not carry out due dilligence.
You would think that; we mostly thought that.  But 'think' and 'legal experts say $foo' are two different things.
tl;dr - We aren't lawyers, so we asked a lawyer who knew the ins and outs of this area of law.

not no how, disable HTTPS immediately."  So we did, and added some extra code to disable
SSH over AX.25 at the same time.
I'm inclined to think that it would be necessary but entirely insufficient.  Unless
the keys were broadcast on the same interval as the station's callsign (or if the
keys were the station's callsign, suitably labeled).

Saving out estate information on greenbar paper with a dot matrix printer... classy.
I like it.
I dislike the idea of a contingency plan that uses lots of tricky moving parts like this,
but on the other hand Shamir's secret sharing is also the ideal (if not close to the ideal)
tool to solve this kind of problem.
Shamir seems like the kind of thing that /somebody/ has to have put together in Javascript
and thrown onto a Github page someplace.  A little poking around revealed this one
(  I think the scenario here would be:
* You throw up a copy of this on your website, probably unlinked from any other page.
* You use it to do an m-of-n split of the core secret (password to the credential database,
  formula for your disappearing/reappearing ink, whatever).
* On another system, you reassemble several combinations of the m-of-n secrets to test that
  they can be used to reconstitute the core secret successfully.
* You get your /n/ friends and family members together, and each one writes down /personally/
  (this helps solve the "I can't read your handwriting" problem) their share of the secret.
  Preferably more than once, so they can be stored in multiple locations (LOCKSS).
There are probably more ways that this procedure can be hardened, but off the cuff it seems
like a good place to start.
