is there something wrong with otr? or is it just the implementations you don't like? I'm looking to learn more here...not challenge your statement.

@_subject: [Cryptography] PGP -- Can someone help me understand something? 
This is a really basic question, but I'm posting it here because I don't know where else to start.  I'll welcome any sort of help, but certainly don't mind links to articles or someone telling me to go google this or that term.  I don't know enough to even start searching.
It begins with this post I recently saw on the Proton Mail reddit:  The question was, basically, if someone has access to both a PGP encrypted email and a plain text version of the same email, can an attacker determine the key.  The answer given was "no".
I don't understand.  Why can't that happen?  For example, if I have 10 + x = 50  (this can be replaced with any formula that has exactly one unknown), I can solve for X.  In my thinking, isn't the unknown in the equation simply the key?  Sure, the maths are more complex, but it should be a trivial issue to work backwards and solve for the key.
Thanks in advance for the help.

what do you mean by this statement? how does it not work? I'm not trying to be argumentative or disagree....I simply don't understand what you are trying to say.
