@_subject: Misinformation: new crypto product 
A recent press release about a new cryptographic product, "Permanent  Privacy" (P.P.), mentioning my name, has led to a slew of  dramatically mistaken reports. Corrections: I have never had a  cryptography-related connection to Harvard. I had nothing to  do with  the press release.
Concerning my alleged support for the claim that P.P. provides  "...the world's first practical data encryption system that is  absolutely unbreakable.":
Its "practical" versions are not "absolutely unbreakable", as I tried  hard to convince them. The only claim I ever supported was that if  the additive stream cipher that is one component of P.P. consists of  a properly managed 'One-Time-Pad', it (obviously) provides  unbreakable encryption.

Referring to your note of August 1: I haven't found anything about  breaking RC4 if used with a newly randomly generated key (unrelated to  any others) for every communication session. I would appreciate being  (Of course one should throw away initial parts of the stream. I  suggested doing this to Ron Rivest & RSA in the early 1980s,  legitimately knowing about the still-secret RC4 cipher-logic from a  client, to whom I made the same suggestion. But even if one doesn't,  the result isn't what I would call "breaking" RC4.) I should say that  I was appalled when I first learned of people using RC4 with related  keys; its structure certainly suggested to me that there would be  Is your partly negative recommendation for AES' "...for most new  protocol purposes" to do with the recent related-key attack? Which I  would certainly agree is very disquieting, even though, as you say, it  has no current negative consequences.
I may speculate elsewhere about who knew what & why before the recent  Thank you!
