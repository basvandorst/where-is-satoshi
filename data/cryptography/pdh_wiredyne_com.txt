@_subject: Beware of /dev/random on Mac OS X 
It's a /dev/urandom which has been labeled "/dev/random".  It claims
to be a Yarrow implementation so is presumably only 160 bits strong.
(See As I'm sure everybody here knows, /dev/random on every other OS blocks
until it has enough entropy available because that is what /dev/random
is.  The design goal is that it is as strong as the number of bits
read from it.
Here are the NetBSD and Linux man pages for comparison:
consider it to be unimportant:
This workaround doesn't cut it for three reasons.
First, the entropy pool in Yarrow is only 160 bits.  From Section 6
"Open Questions and Plans for the Future" of the Yarrow paper
referenced above:
If the program needs more than 160 bits, it can seed it with more than
that amount of entropy.  (Strictly, it could seed it with 160 bits,
read it, seed it, read it...., but this isn't mentioned on the man
Second, the seeding process needs to guarantee that no other process
drains the entropy pool before it can read it.  This is not possible.
Three, the great idea behind /dev/random is that the program doesn't
have to manage entropy itself.  This is a good thing because the
kernel has access to entropic bits which the process doesn't.  Also,
each environment varies so good sources of entropy on one machine may
not be so good on another.  /dev/random permits the implementation of
good portable crypto - except to OS X.
Apple apparently only accepts bug reports from members of the "Apple
Developers Connection".  If any such members are on this list, it
might be a good idea to submit a report:
Apple's inability to provide a real /dev/random is inexplicable given
that free implementations have been available for years.  Even if
Apple feels uncomfortable with GPL'd code, there's BSD licensed code
as well.

PStego.py is a module which can map between permutations and integers.
Permutations, such as a shuffled deck of cards, can then be used to
conceal and convey information.  It's at:

@_subject: M-209 broken in WWII 
Hadmut Danisch quoted "As a german codebreaker in World War II":
German success against the M-209 is discussed in David Kahn's "The
Codebreakers".  It cites a 1962 letter as a source, so presumably this
information was in the 1967 edition.  In other words, German
cryptanalytic success has been public for a long time.
Kahn's book has quite a bit of good information on Axis cryptanalytic
efforts.  Germany was particularly successful, and was using
automation to assist their work.
One little gem is that Italy managed to pull off an active attack
against the Yugoslav Army.  They had been reading Yugoslav traffic for
awhile, got into a difficult situation, and convinced two divisions
they had been ordered to retreat using fake messages.  By the time
this was discovered and resolved the game was over.

And one of those places is the US itself.  African-Americans have no
trouble envisioning scenarios in which mandatory IDs and universal
surveillance could be a problem.  Japanese-Americans don't have to
think very hard to remember that banking regulation can also be used
to "freeze" bank accounts, or that postal and census data can be used
by the Army to put a particular ethnic group in concentration camps.
