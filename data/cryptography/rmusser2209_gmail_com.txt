@_subject: [Cryptography] Boing Boing pushing an RSA Conference boycott 
I admit I may be coming in at the wrong time /misunderstanding, but RSA IS NOT the only security conference in the world. Nor is it the only industry recognized one.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Question on crypto implementation in existing python 
I had the idea of making a simple application in python that would only
encrypt/decrypt a file dragged onto the window or decrypt an encrypted file
dropped onto the window using strong symmetric encryption. I say python as
its the language I'm most comfortable with.
I thought there would be an existing library that would be able to abstract
away almost all of the crypto implementation behind an API, in that I would
not need to build one using primitives, but so far I have been unable to
find anything except for "cryptography"
Which I'm not too keen on using as the only "recipe" available is for
symmetric encryption using AES 128 in CBC mode, which, from googling a bit
seems relatively weak.
Are there any existing crypto libraries that are available with a more
secure encryption method?
The goal is for it to be free/open, and  available on Win/OSX/Linux.
