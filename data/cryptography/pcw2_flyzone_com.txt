These are very unsettling stories. But my favorite from recent days comes from the Oct 26 NY Times:
  "Federal prosecutors said Mr. Hanhardt used law enforcement computers and other databases to get information on traveling jewelry sales representatives, including itineraries and car rental information. Prosecutors said many of the thefts were from the rented automobiles. "
Mr. Hanhardt was Chief of Detectives for the Chicago Police Department. His gang, which operated from the early 1980's to 1998, reportedly stole more than $5 million. This may not be the best estimate because as part of his plea bargain, he's going to pay $4.8 million and cash equal to half of the equity in his home. There were 6 people in the gang. We probably don't know the full extent of his crime spree.

These are all good ideas, but I don't know how often you'll get to try them, much less use them enough to extract enough information.
I wrote a paper a long time ago that tweaked compression algorithms. It wasn't meant to be secure, only ensure that the compression algorithms constantly changed the set of bits assigned to each character. This meant that a Huffman algorithm encoding 'e' as '0010' at one point would use '1011' later. It was a simple remapping of the compression tree so it wouldn't cost much.
But I don't think it had any security on its own.

You can draw the line anywhere you choose. You want more positives? You just move the bar. You want less? You move the bar. The mechanism is scientific, but it's also based on statistics and it's impossible to predict what kind of image will carry what length message.
The basic scheme is very simple. Generally the inserted message has higher entropy than the raw LSBs of an image. So the entropy of the picture/message combo should be higher than the picture alone. So you look at the entropy and choose all images that pass a threshold. You can do better by using your understanding of normal images to create more sophisticated statistics. But there's little you can do about large images and small messages. As the proportion of changed pixels drops, the statistics end up closer and closer to the norm.
So even though there's some cool science in the process, there's no scientific way to draw the line.

Yes, you're right. Good steganography isn't that hard to generate-- especially if you're not greedy.
Yes, I'm glad someone noticed this. It's a great datapoint!

I used to think that CCD cameras were a pretty good approximation of random number generators, but not any longer. I've seen too many pictures where the LSB is heavily correlated with some of the higher order bits. Really. There are some good pictures documenting in my book. So while I think you're making a fair point, experience doesn't always suggest that it work out that way.

@_subject: Russia Intercepts US Military Communications? 
I showed this link to a friend who fixes helicopters for the Army/Marines. He was incredulous at first, but then said, "Oh, they probably just turned off the crypto. There's a switch to do that. Sometimes you have to do that if things screw up."
He went on to talk about "crypto" as if it was something like fuel or food. He said, "They probably loaded up 4 or 5 days of crypto at the beginning, but then they had to turn it off after the supply lines got muddled."
So this would be consistent with some key management structures but not with others. If you give a unit a good random number source and diffie-hellman, they should be able to go the entire war without running out of "crypto." But I don't know if the US military embraces the kind of hierarchy-free key management imagined by cypherpunks.
Of course, many of the details from the Russian could be gathered from raw traffic analysis. It's easy to count messages and triangulate to figure out where US troops are massing. It's also easy to tell that an absence of messages from the interior of the city means that the US troops haven't entered yet. The crypto may cloak the details of the messages, but those details may not be too important. (I wouldn't be surprised if they carried some news of the NCAA basketball tournament, for instance.)

@_subject: eWeek: Cryptography Guru Paul Kocher Speaks Out 
Here's what I took away from the paper:
The crucial point seems to be that you can't do much better than finding $n$ hiding spots in a document/file (call them "bits") to make $n$ different marks signifying ownership. So if you sell copy $i$ to person $i$ you flip $i$.
You can do some clever coding, but it's all just a minimum of one bit per person/mark.
Let's say four people get together to steal a document by "averaging" their documents. Since you can't have half a bit, they flip a coin for the four bits, "i,j,k$ and $l$ that are different in the four documents. Two of these will be returned to the "unmarked" position and two will be left accusing two of the people. There should be no easy way for the thieves to know who's left on the hook.
It's possible to flip several bits for each person increasing the odds. If you flip, say, 16 bits for each person/mark, then the gang of four will find 64 different bits in their files. They flip some coins and each person is still stuck with an average of about 8 bits accusing them. This is certainly better, but it takes more work to hide 16 bits/person.
How do you hide the bits? Any stego will do. Some error correction can make it even more interesting.
My feeling is that this is a pretty solid result because it didn't seem like one could do much better. A few tweaks of the problem, though, may yield something different. It's still not a well-defined Of course, I'm willing to be corrected/pestered/pilloried/praised etc. by those on the list who came away with other conclusions.

Good point. They had some workaround for this. I don't have time to reread the paper right now for a zillion reasons. I think they were using some coding scheme that effectively put $n$ vectors in an n-dimensional vector space. That's not exactly the same as flipping $n$ bits. I guess I was looking at one canonical form in my brain.
Plus they had several levels and modifications that increased security in different ways. It's been some time. If I remember correctly, they included a rich theoretical framework which makes it a bit harder to digest.
Perhaps someone else has the time to explain this in a better way. My apologies for dealing from memory, but it's all I can offer at this

@_subject: The Pure Crypto Project's Hash Function 
Let's not forget one of the best reasons to use a very non-linear hash function like SHA: forging signatures. Your function may inadvertently allow this depending upon the values of A, B and C.
Let m and m' be numbers/messages. If Alice signs m with RSA, it's possible for anyone to convert this into a signature of m' with a few Let Alice's signature be m^d mod n. She really should be computing h(m)^d mod n, but she's not.
Now let's say we can talk Alice into signing m'/m by computing (m'/m)^d mod n.
Multiply the two together to get (m^d)(m'/m)^d mod n=m'^d mod n. Voila a signature of m'.
Obviously this depends upon getting Alice to sign two values.  Even if she tries to avoid signing m', she might get tricked into doing so. Non-linear hash functions like SHA prevent this.
Can your hash function stop this? I don't think it will if C=n. I'm not sure about other cases. Algebra has lots of strange loopholes. Blenders like SHA avoid them.

Some watermarking systems deliberately avoid this problem. For instance the early work (circa 95) of Ingemar Cox et al at NEC described a system where multiple watermarks could be written without overwriting each other. There were other limitations to the system, but it's possible to build a system where the watermarks don't "write over each other".
The easiest way to see this is to think about radio stations. As long as they're broadcasting on different frequencies, they don't interfere too much. If you put your watermark at one frequency, then another frequency won't interfere.
The problem is that the detector generally needs to know the "frequency". That means an attacker can often find it out and write a new watermark at exactly that "frequency". So there's something to your idea, it just requires a bit more work.

Changing around the order of a list of items is a pretty cool way to hide information. You can hide about log_2(n!) bits of information in a list of n items. In the case of words, you can move around the inner letters as long as there are no duplicates.
If you want to experiment with the basic technique, check out this web page with an applet I wrote.

Very nice line.
I have to agree. There are always two channels in steganography and its cousin watermarking. You want to make changes in one channel so the other channel isn't affected. In this case, a munged word doesn't affect the human reader but it can carry log_2(n!) bits where n=count of non-duplicate letters - 2. So we have two channels.
Now, I will admit that a large number of munged words will trigger something in the human, but it's entirely possible that three or four munged words on a page WON'T EVEN BE NOTICED. Believe me. I've proof read books a number of times and it's surprising how much gets through even the best copy editors.
Three or four words per page is also enough to insert more than a few bits of watermarking. A seven letter word can carry almost seven bits. So let's call it 6 bits. If you change four seven letter words on a page, you've 24 bits. Not bad.

You're kind, but still missing some of the nuance. It's possible to encode these bits in a secure way that would be worthy of any student of cryptography.
I believe it's possible to encode bits in the order of things in a way that is JUST AS SECURE as the hash function being used.
The code below uses MD5, but it could use any hash function. If we assume the random oracle model, I think it's pretty obvious that one can't extract the message without finding a way to put a crack in the hash function.
The example only uses disco songs, but it applies to any list of things. Obviously rearranging the letters creates spelling mistakes, but I think there are plenty of lists of objects with no obvious ordering. That's why I chose disco songs.
