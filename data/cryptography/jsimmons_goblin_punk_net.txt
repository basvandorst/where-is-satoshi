@_subject: Hackers Targeting Home Computers 
Unless I'm misunderstanding you, I find this hard to believe.
[Moderator's note: I find it easy to believe, because I see exactly
what he does on the networks I control. I don't know why you are
attacked less often. --Perry]
On my computer (DSL, fixed IP), which is pretty heavily monitored, I'm detecting only a few, maybe up to a dozen, actual attacks a day.  Most of them are from well-known root kits, targeting old vulnerabilities.  Sunrpc, lpr, imap, and anonymous ftp seem to be popular.  Most attacks come from Asia, eastern Europe used to be popular, but seems to have died down recently.
The only way I could get anywhere near your numbers is to count all of the Windows-based http attacks coming from automated worms and the like.
I'd be interested in hearing from others what kind and frequency of attacks they're experiencing.
This is of course true no matter what the frequency of attacks is.

OpenBSD has recently added the ipsecctl command, which greatly simplifies setting up IPSEC VPNs, especially between OpenBSD machines. A config file can be as simple as (from the man page):
ike esp from 192.168.3.1 to 192.168.3.2
ike esp from 10.1.1.0/24 to 10.1.2.0/24 peer 192.168.3.2
And the file structure for storing certs, public/private keys, and shared secrets (which ipsecctl searches automatically) is equally simple.

It wouldn't surprise me if there's been some blowback from the adoption of PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards). As someone who has had to help several small to medium size businesses comply with these 'voluntary' standards, the irony of the fact that the big banks that require them often aren't in compliance themselves hasn't escaped my notice.

Also, PCI certification requires that all of your partners (anyone you exchange payment card information with) be PCI compliant. At the level I work at, it's compulsory. Presently, it seems to apply to anyone taking payment cards over the web, and seems to be working its way down the food chain to brick and mortar vendors.  For me, it's the equivalent of a congressional full employment act, so I'm not complaining a lot. The latter. And for many, many, many other reasons than just the financial hit.
