@_subject: Encryption of data in smart cards 
Can anyone point me to sources about encryption of data in smart
cards. What I am looking for is protocols for encrypting sensitive
data (e.g., medical information about the card-holder), so that
even if the card falls into malicious hands, it won't be easy to
read that data.
Thank you,

My thanks to everyone who has replied to my query above. The
consensus seems to be that it is not usually necessary to encrypt
data stored in the card, and if one wants to do it, one should use
a symmetric key which is not entirely stored in the card.
Best regards,
