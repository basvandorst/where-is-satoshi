@_subject: [Cryptography] Modes of communication 
In Vol 34, Issue 22, following on "RIP Claude Shannon":
There was already  a digital mode, still in use: Teletype (TTY), or as we say in ham radio where it is still used quite a bit, Radio Teletype Not voice, but neither is/was Morse.
(It is to me a little surprising that, given on the one hand the growing interest in cryptography at the time, and on the other the extensive use of both Morse and TTY, that so far as I know there was not much interaction: A lot of Morse or TTY that was transmitted was indeed encrypted, but that was done "separately" just as if the resulting encrypted text was to be sent by courier or handwritten mail or ... There were not cheap, miniature, computing elements, but lots of stuff could have been done between a J-38 key and the transmitter, with what was available, to increase security.)
I don't disagree with what was really being said, just wanted to comment on a bit (no pun intended!) of history.

Sounds "obviously" true, but as a mathematician I know that when I say something is "obvious" other mathematicians will take it to mean I need it to be true but I can't remember how to prove it. (There are lots of mathematician's jokes that amount to definitions of "obvious"...)
In this case it may well be true, but that depends on the whole collection that has been stored. You can choose to omit some fact but at the same time leave in other things that imply part or all of that fact. It is hard to be sure that something is not implicit without a process equivalent to formal verification. So "If it isn't stored" covers a lot more than it appears to.

... Already, one other leading designer of randomness extractors, Xin Li, has built on their work to create sequences of many more random numbers.
Leaks can occur until time forgotten.
Math occurs randomly.
As a mathematician, I could not pass up:
(1) I work on (among other things) non-associative systems. The phrase "many more random numbers" is a delightful example showing English needs parentheses: One has to wonder, how much more random are they?
(2) "Math occurs randomly": Maybe to some extent, but highly correlated with other things. E.g., the effect of Sputnik on research funding...

@_subject: [Cryptography] Radios vs. computers 
There is no computer that is not a radio transmitter. For a personal computer to be sold in the US, all that fancy metal stuff around the cabinet edges, the conductive layers put on a plastic case, etc., are all intended to try to control what it radiates so as to meet FCC specifications. Your computer will have been certified to meet certain requirements, differing depending on the expected use environment. Even a little "wall wart" power supply that you plug into the wall to charge a cell phone or to run a small appliance probably has enough high-transient switching going on that it is radiating fairly strong radio signals. (Older linear supplies don't radiate much but they use more expensive copper and iron so they are disappearing.)
I can remember hearing music played by the ORACLE at Oak Ridge in 1953, I think it was, by turning on a nearby radio and running appropriate code, and a decade later similarly for the little IBM 1620. What you want to do may not depend on your computer transmitting, but someone else wanting to hear what you are doing might well take advantage of it. Try putting a radio near your computer(s) and running a variety of programs. The radio will definitely pick up signals, but whether it puts out sounds that you can hear depends on how it is choosing to demodulate those signals as well as what frequencies it detects. AM will more likely produce a sound you can hear than FM would, but the signals are there even if they don't get demodulated in a way your ears pick them up.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Hacking spread spectrum clocking of HW ? 
In the US hams can encrypt under exactly one specified circumstance: Control of a space station, meaning a radio station on a satellite. That is presumably to keep "outsiders" from taking over control. In general a US ham cannot transmit anything intended to conceal information. (That exception is the basis for a question frequently appearing on ham license exams.)
Back during and at the end of WWI, the US Navy wanted control over all broadcasting. That by itself has little to do with cryptography, but a combination of that desire implying limiting what hams could do and fear that uncontrolled radio operations could include spying for foreign powers leads to this denial, which is a connection to crypto. And it might explain why this restriction is not found (so far as I know) outside the US. So spread spectrum cannot be used to conceal anything. But the FCC rules governing the amateur service specifically justify the existence and encouragement of the service in large part based on the progress in communication coming from hams experimenting and developing new techniques, hence exceptions for experiments intended to improve It is hard to write enforceable rules that say you can do X but not if your intent is to accomplish Y, resulting in very specific statements about what you can and cannot do: That implies they are soon obsolete, hence need revision from time to time, and that is definitely what has happened with respect to spread spectrum use by hams.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Readable manuals, and fixing bugs by documenting them 
Just a couple of old-fogie thoughts... (These points came up in different threads, so saying "Re..." doesn't really work well.
One of the bad things for manual construction was the development of documentation software. For this purpose I include everything from word processors through the various roffs and the like. I was working in an industrial setting at the time when management began to notice those. There had been on the staff editors and other people who new some grammar and diction, with all manuals having to pass through their hands. An extra step costing money... So documentation reverted to those of us producing the product to be documented. The quality of documentation we supplied plummeted. Technical education and experience don't necessarily imply ability in using natural language or describing how to do something. (We've probably all had teachers who were world experts in their fields but could not explain anything...) So one reason those great manuals disappeared is that the people who wrote them disappeared first.
And some bugs have to be documented but must not be "fixed". Another place where I worked was bringing out a line of minicomputers (that will let you date this...) that were to be sold as an upgrade path from machines another company built, so that our boxes would run the same code but do it faster, with looser constraints on sizes, etc. Fine idea, but the boxes we were emulating (including their OS and many applications) were not bug free, and we found some customer had built their applications relying on some of the bugs. We were seriously told we had to go for "bug level compatibility". But of course other customers had to get documentation that told what the system really would do.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Bamford: Over Eight Years, President, 
in, the World. To What End?
I can't say I like decisions being made by unknowns, but I also doubt that expecting Congress or state legislatures to decide on the details would be an improvement. In both Congress and the state houses we see concentrations of people who think gut feelings combined with polling data of questionable accuracy are the way to make decisions, ignoring or even reacting specifically against any "facts" I would like to see them considering. So I think we may be much better off with legislation that includes blanks, to be filled in by people who at least specialize in the subject. Is that being done perfectly, no, but it is certainly being done better than in my state's legislature or in Congressional floor actions. (And when decisions appear to be made by our representatives they are usually really crafted by those representative's staff or by Congressional or legislative support staff, just as unknown, with little involvement by the representatives themselves.)
But I do agree that those decisions have not generally been made by the current or previous presidents, and that we ought to pay attention to legislative elections!

Re: Liar Paradox Redux (Vol 57, Issue 22)
So now the mission statement requires infinitely unrolling the "critical mission", i.e. it is self referent. We can be glad they have fast machines, but how much power will that consume? Or is that to be done only by those outside the agency...?
