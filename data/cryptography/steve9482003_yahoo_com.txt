@_subject: two number theory questions 
Hi, I have two number theory questions:
Question Assume that p is a large prime and g is a generator.
Given y=g^b mod p but no b (that is, b is unknown), are there efficient algorithms to compute z=g^{b^{-1}} mod p?
Question Assume that p is a large prime and g is a generator.
Given y=g^{b^2} mod p but no b (that is, b is unknown), are there efficient algorithms to compute z=g^b mod p? How about computing y from z (b is still unknown)? Thank you.
