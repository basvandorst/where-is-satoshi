When he said "I am sorry, but I think what you're asking for here is
impossible.", he was referring to the question whether the TrueCrypt
trademark could be used, and whether the license of the code could be
changed. However, the license does allow a fork (with a few conditions,
such as using another name and pointing to the truecrypt site) under the
same license.
The road we are going down now is to
 - short-term:
and get used to the code and building process. Then release a version
with the fixes the audit recommended.
 - long-term: decided yet) the parts of the code that are problematic license-wise
(apparently not all are, since TC also borrowed some crypto code) and
release under another license (BSD, MIT or GPL, has not been decided
The project has a website: ciphershed.org. Most of this has been stated
on the projects wiki.
