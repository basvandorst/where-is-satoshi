I'd agree with this. On the Web, people are impatient because they're
trying to complete a transaction in real time. It's very rare to expect
an immediate response by email. With IM it depends on the individual
conversation and the feedback you're getting. eg, if you're chatting
with someone in real time and the software shows you the other person is
typing a reply you'll wait, while if there's no feedback you may just
assume they've left the room for some reason. But either way, it's not
Latency issues really apply much more to things that stream - audio,
video, voice calls. And high-speed trading, but that seems beyond the
scope of this conversation.

I do the latter a lot. I think all journalists do, except the very lazy
ones. :)

@_subject: [Cryptography] Explaining PK to grandma 
Well, it seems to me Grandpa has bigger problems (because Granny uses
real email to communicate with the family while organizing summer
outings to ballet for 20):
1) For email, Grandpa uses Webmail. The service he uses doesn't offer an
easy way to plug in crypto.
2) But for most of his personal messaging Grandpa uses Facebook because
he finds that his grandkids regard email as something you only use if
3) Where Granny is actually pretty good with the computer because she
kept the books for her church for several decades, Grandpa had a
secretary and hasn't a clue. So Granny can learn, but Grandpa struggles
so much that his son has set up the machine so when he turns it on
everything loads automatically and logs him in.
For a fair number of people, getting them to use crypto will require
them to change their daily habits: the email software they use, the
service they use, even their address. I think you're underestimating the
amount of upheaval - and consequently overestimating people's
willingness to take it on. For the vast majority of people, email isn't
email as *we* think of it.
P.S. I am really fed up with elderly females always being the go-to
example of the clueless user.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Smart electricity meters can be dangerously 
Ross Anderson has written a great deal about this. In his view, I
believe the biggest risk is that hackers can crash the grid by turning
the meters all off at once, from where it would take the Uk sevveral
weeks to recover.

I was speaking from memory, so no, not handy (and am in an airline
lounge). But Ross's home page - cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14 (I think, also from
memory) should have the paper he wrote about smart meters. But I note
that I can hear him *saying* it in my head, which suggests it may have
been in a phone interview or discussion.
