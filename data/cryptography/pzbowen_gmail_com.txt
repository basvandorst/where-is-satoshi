@_subject: [Cryptography] NIST should publish Suite A 
A good starting point would be to look at the publicly available
documentation about Type 1 algorithms and which are likely to make up
Suite A.
There appear to be two primary Type 1 asymmetric/public key
algorithms: FIREFLY and MAYFLY.  FIREFLY is the older of the two and
appears to be based on Finite Field DLP or RSA.  MAYFLY is based on
Elliptic Curves.  The NSA has developed a hybrid or transition
approach called "Enhanced FIREFLY" that allows systems to use EC when
both ends support it and fall back to basic FIREFLY when they do not.
Government of Canada[1] among others):
"Enhanced FIREFLY (EFF) is a key management technique that makes use
of existing FIREFLY technology to implement Elliptic Curve
cryptography (specifically, a form of the MAYFLY Elliptic Curve
technology). TACLANE is able to use MAYFLY with other enhanced-capable
TACLANEs. TACLANE can also negotiate down, if necessary, to Basic FF
for TACLANEs that have not been upgraded to support EFF. Enhanced
FIREFLY therefore serves as a bridge between the existing FIREFLY
infrastructure and the move to a solely Elliptic Curve solution"
PKCS11 Version 2.0 Draft 2 (from RSA's FTP server[2]) helpfully
provides a little more detail about MAYFLY.  A MAYFLY public key
object has four attributes:
- Prime p (512 to 1024 bits, in steps of 64 bits)
- Subprime q (160 bits)
- Base g (512 to 1024 bits, in steps of 64 bits)
- Public value W
p, q, and g are collectively the "MAYFLY parameters".  The MAYFLY
private key objects are very similar except replace "Public value W"
with "Private value w".
This description is virtually identical to the ECDSA public and
private key objects in the same specification.
A common block cipher algorithm in Suite A is MEDLEY.  MEDLEY can be
used in the same modes as AES: ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR, and GCM.[3]
GCM is probably the preferred mode of operation for IPSEC-like use.[4]
 MEDLEY may have very small block sizes - 4 bytes and 8 bytes.[5]  It
does appear to be slower than its predecessor BATON (one vendor has
300Mb/s for BATON and 200Mb/s for MEDLEY[6]).
The "MEDLEY Implementation Standard" is dated 30 November 2001, which
is four days after the FIPS PUB 197 (AES) was published.  GCM was not
published until 2004, which suggests that, like AES, MEDLEY had GCM
introduced at a later date.  My money would be on MEDLEY being a
variant of one of the AES finalist algorithms, quite possibly Rijndael
I'm sure there is more information that can be easily gleaned from
public sources, but it is clear the EC is a core part of Suite A.

I found a second data point: Secure Communication Interoperability
Protocol (SCIP)  (
The SCIP specification appears to be the follow-on to the STU and STE
specifications and SCIP 233 Rev. 1.1 lists the crypto modes.  Many of
the details are in reference modules of the specification that are not
public, but the Key Material and Key Processing reference module
titles make it clear that EC is a core part of the specification.

This should have been "any open source system or device".  Every
public CA is required to meet these requirements, so this is not a
unique problem for Let's Encrypt.  I don't think any public CA can
both meet the requirements to be a public CA and be 100% open source.

I am not from Mozilla, but there have been postings in several forums
that answer this.  The short answer is Let's Encrypt is not getting
special treatment from Mozillla.  They are planning to start as CA
that is subordinate to the IdenTrust (DST) root and then apply for
acceptance into all browsers using the normal processes.  Presumably
this means they will have to pass the same WebTrust for CA and
WebTrust for BR audits other CAs have to pass.
According to Ian Grigg, who was the independent auditor for CAcert,
they chose to not ask Mozilla to include CAcert in the Mozilla list of
trusted roots (

And various docs have indicated that BATON is used in CBC mode with
BIP32 for integrity while the newer MEDLEY algorithm is used in
galois/counter mode.  So both look like common block ciphers.

I think this is confused.  It is a 20 byte (160 bit key) combined with
20 byte "checksum" which is tied to the key.  I would guess this is a
keyed checksum used to ensure that only authorized keys are used.
I'm guessing BIP32 is a bit-interleaved parity algorithm, so you are
only looking at 4 bytes of checksum for bulk data.

With due respect, you are not representing the thread correctly.  The
discussion was about whether to allow certs that were issued before
the cutoff or just distrust all certs issued by the CA..
P.S. You might want to make clear that you mean Digicert Sdn, not
DigiCert Inc.  They are two unrelated companies and, as far as I know,
DigiCert Inc has no issues.

Pathlen = 0 means the CA can only issue end-entity certificates and
cannot be used to sign further CA certificates.  Path length of zero
is a good thing and is correctly interpreted by every certificate
validation library I know about.
It is fairly common practice for a CA operator to create issuing CAs
(e.g. pathlen=0) for customers for branding purposes or to enable
authorization via issuer.  In these cases the issuing CA is the same
as every other CA operated by the same company (e.g. Symantec or
Comodo), but the issuer name is the customer name.
Mozilla is working on getting all CAs to add info on their issuing CAs
to their database; you can see the current status at
If there are checkboxes under both "CP/CPS Same As Parent" and "Audit
Same As Parent", then it is safe to assume that the issuing CA is just
a branded CA operated by the parent.

I respectfully disagree.  There is action to improve the status quo.
I also do think there are members of the CA/Browser Forum who are open
to suggestions on how to make things better.  But they have to work in
the world that exists.
The key challenge is how does a human using a web browser authenticate
a connection to a website that they have never previously visited?
This the core problem that browsers are trying to solve by using PKIs.
Right now the best solution is to have a third party (a CA) do checks
ahead of time and issue a signed certificate stating that they did
checks.  An alternative model is DANE, where the third party signs an
identity that then certifies that a specific public key is held by the

I think there is some confusion over how CAs get into the trust anchor
lists of popular web browsers and operating systems.
Each browser and operating system[1] has a policy that lays out the
requirements to be accepted in to their list.  Some of them are more
detailed than others and some are more transparent and open than
others.  All of them, as far as I know require an audit report from an
independent auditor covering their operations.  Most of them impose a
set of requirements the operation of CAs and some (but not all)
require that the CA follow the CA/Browser Forum guidelines.
Each browser or OS makes its own decision on who gets in.  This is
clear if you compare; the venn diagram of the different trust anchor
lists has overlaps but is clearly not a full overlap.
Mozilla is notable because it does run a open and transparent process
to determine what goes into its policy and review whether CAs meet the
requirements.  They have made it clear that they want community input
and discussion on their policy.  They have also made it clear that the
CA/B Forum is not the final rule for them -- they add and remove
requirements as the community sees fit.
So, I beg you, please participate in mozilla.dev.security.policy and
help set the requirements.  That is far more valuable than debating
which standards organization umbrella is best.
