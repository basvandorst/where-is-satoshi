@_subject: 1024-bit RSA keys in danger of compromise 
I think there's a general consensus that the minimum
recommended key size for X9.42 Diffie-Hellman PGP keys is 1024bits.  I'm not sure if the standard size is 1536bits.
I  might be wrong, but I don't believe such a key length
standard exists. I think the only size related limitation
in X9.42 was related only to size of the prime defining
the Galos Field.  I haven't worked with X9.42 before.
There does not appear to be many 1536bit keys in the global PGP
public keyring (the keys of the synchronized public keyservers).
I count 1,057 in my copy of the ring, or 0.0748% of the
total keys in the ring.
Here is more information about that ring:
