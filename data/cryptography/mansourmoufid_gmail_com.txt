@_subject: [Cryptography] How programming language design can help us 
Speaking of FORTRAN, there is an interesting parallel here
with the early calculators.
Before the standard for floating point arithmetic (IEEE 754),
the same formula (program) would produce different results on
different calculators (computers).
Those computers that, given a good program, would produce bad
results, Kahan called "egregious machines."
    If a simple program works and is proved mathematically
    always to work well enough on all but a few commercially
    significant computers, who should bear the onus of
    adapting it to the aberrant machines?
    In the past, the onus has fallen mostly upon the owners
    of aberrant machines or upon the creator of the program,
    rather than upon the creators of aberrant arithmetics.
    ...
    To lift that onus from all of us, we must persuade the
    designers and builders of computer arithmetics that ...
     1: aberrant designs can invalidate certain familiar
        calculations performed by most other machines
        without any trouble;
     2: to compensate for aberrant arithmetic, software must
        become more complicated, costly and unreliable; and
     3: their customers are aware of these truths.
        (I am not quite sure about item 3.)
Replace "arithmetics" with logic, and "machines" with compilers,
and we are in the same situation three decades later...

Those compilers have customers.  GCC has users.
Regarding the previous example of integer operations which GCC claims
are undefined behaviour: there are six formal semantics of C, not one
agrees with GCC.  No reasonable reading of the standard does.
The tragedy is when the GCC developers' abusive interpretations of the
standard become the de facto standard.
There are two C programmers: those who use GCC, and those who don't
want an adversarial relationship with their compiler.

Check out Clight and CompCert:
I compile large projects like Tor using CompCert with a simple
"./configure CC=ccomp" and the results are just as fast.
As a bonus, CompCert has an "interpreter" that can find undefined
behaviour for you.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Photojournalists & filmmakers want cameras to be 
FYI --
Photojournalists and filmmakers call on camera makers to include encryption
Filmmakers and photojournalists have their cameras and footage seized 'at a
rate that is literally too high to count,' according to the Freedom of the
Press Foundation.
Now you look suspicious and they'll just take your camera if you don't give
the password.
Encryption also makes it impossible to recover photos after you are forced
to delete them.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Photojournalists & filmmakers want cameras, 
There's a big difference between what people think they will get with
encryption and what they will actually get. They want: "No one can see
my pictures without my password." What they'll get is "I see you have
encrypted photos here, this way to enhanced interrogation."
Same for authentication. Most likely cameras will embed encrypted
metadata in photos, which the manufacturer will decrypt in the cloud.
"myphotos.canon.com says you were at place X on day Y."
Encryption in cameras is a dumb idea. People will just have to try it
to see why. Good luck to them.

@_subject: [Cryptography] another security vulnerability / travesty 
Fax is ephemeral, email is permanent.  If someone intercepts
a fax, they get those couple pages.  If someone hacks an email
account, they get everything from years ago to today.
Fax is local, email is remote.  When you send a fax to a doctor,
the transmission probably doesn't leave your city, so the set of
attackers is limited to those near you.  Email is global and
can be hacked by anyone.
Email can be encrypted but encryption is overrated in my opinion.

Staticbit is a script to encode a bitstream as static noise.
I have encoded two files of equal length:
    $ python staticbit.py -e a.wav < README.md
    $ wc README.md
           4      23     151 README.md
   $ python -c "print('\x00' * 150)" | python staticbit.py -e b.wav
Download the files here:
Determine which file is which and prove it.
Have fun!

Hello again,
There is a message in puzzle2.wav:

Hint: The noise is the signal and the signal is the noise. :)

Use whatever login system you already use, not something new.
Create a password twice as long as usual, give half of it to each employee.
Or use two factor authentication and give each person one factor, i.e. one
person knows the password, the other has Duo or Yubikey or whatever 2FA you

@_subject: [Cryptography] Proper Entropy Source 
You mean source of randomness, entropy is the measure of randomness.
Given two finite schemes A and B, the entropy of the product AB is
H(AB) = H(A) + H(B|A).
If A and B are independent then H(B|A) = H(B) and H(AB) = H(A) + H(B).
It is always true that H(B|A) <= H(B).
In the worst case, B is deterministic, then H(B|A) = 0 and H(AB) = H(A).
The proof of this property is in the first chapter of "Mathematical
Foundations of Information Theory" by Khinchin.
In other words, software can never increase entropy, at best it
contributes nothing.

A contradiction.
False. According to the uniqueness theorem, there is one and only one
definition of entropy.
See Khinchin for the proof (theorem 1, page 9):
    It is not possible to "increase" entropy with a deterministic scheme (software).
Again, see Khinchin for the proof (page 6).
These proofs are the foundation of probability theory. If you find an
error in them, let the world know.
