@_subject: Fermat's primality test vs. Miller-Rabin 
Where does it say Miller-Rabin is immune to Carmichael numbers? It
seems confusingly worded and says that Fermat's Test is not immune to
Carmichaels, but this does not imply M-R is immune. Additionally, the
book says "We limit the probability of a false result [with M-R] to
2^(-128) to achieve our required security level."
To me it looks like M-R just eliminates some needless computation that
a naive application of the Fermat test would require. Computing "a^n -
a (mod n)" is harder than computing smaller powers of "a" and checking
each of those. This is why s the largest s such that 2 does not divide
s is found. If one power "q" is such that "a^(sq) - a != 0 (mod n)"
then continued squaring isn't going to generate a power of "a" that is
congruent to 1.
The "n" vs "n-1" distinction appears only when discussing if "x^2 - 1
= 0 (mod n)". This is why M-R fails for "n=2".

That depends on the size of the numbers you're working with...
Considering the research that goes into fast implementations of
PowerMod I don't think the required computation is trivial.
Yes I guess the difference is that with MR you are trying to find a
number that is *likely* a prime, whereas with Fermat you are testing
primality. But MR will still fail when given a Carmichael number,
since elsewhere MR is defined as iterated application of the Fermat
test [1].
