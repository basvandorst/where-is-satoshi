it seems that Juniper used Dual_EC_DRBG with their own backdoored constants[0]. Worse, they discovered that some constants was changed to insert a backdoor in ScreenOS that allow passive VPN decryption. It's
not exactly clear how, but agl report on his blog[1] after a twitter
conversion that it might be a simple replacement of the backdoored
constants of Dual_EC_DRBG used in ScreenOS.
One thing that I still don't understand is their custom paramters for
the curve used by Dual_EC and what was exactly modified by the attacker.
Do we have more explanations now ? :-)

I was looking exactly for what was posted on rpw.sh today :).
But how Juniper did not discovered the modification of their own Q if
they were using it as backdoor ? (meaning that they were in the dark
during three years).
BTW, I understand how Dual_EC works, I've written a basic implementation
of it in golang (generation & attack) few days ago[0].

I almost never used VPN based on Juniper solutions, but I imagine we
can investigate in the initial handshake to establish the VPN connection
to see if there is some output coming from the backdoored generator. If
there is enough bits, then it's almost done (we only need at least 30
bytes from Dual_EC when using NIST-P256, which is the case with the
Juniper's backdoor). There is a really good paper analysing how to
do passive decryption of TLS traffic when using Dual_EC_DRBG[0].
