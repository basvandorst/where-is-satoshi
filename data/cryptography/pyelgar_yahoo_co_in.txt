@_subject: RNG using AES CTR as encryption algorithm 
Hi all,
I have implemented RNG using AES algorithm in CTR mode.
To test my implementation I needed some test vectors.
How ever I searched on the CSRC site, but found the test vectors for AES_CBC not for AES CTR.
Please? can any one tell me where to look for the test vectors to test RNG using? AES CTR.
Thanks in advance Priya Ainapur
