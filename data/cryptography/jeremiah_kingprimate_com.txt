@_subject: origin of SHA 224 initial hash values 
I'm having trouble pinpointing the origin of the initial hash values for SHA 224 and, for that matter, 128. These values are defined as hex representations of cube roots of primes for sha-1 of lengths 256, 384 and 512, but  I can't find where they were obtained for the shorter Thanks and apologies if this is something well known.

This is Shamir's Three-Pass protocol and it doesn't require a symmetric system, it requires a commutative system. See Schneier p 516 (section 22.3) or [1] for details.
so A(A(M)) != M
Unless I'm mistaken, this commutative system does not leak information in the same way as XOR does.

This is Shamir's Three-Pass Protocol, described in section 22.3 of Schneier. It requires a commutative cryptosystem.

Let me get this right: here we have a page which appears to be from
domain A, but in fact it has frame(s) which display domain B. This
allows a page to have the content from domain B but the outward
appearance is of domain A, including the SSL lock on the page which
indicates "this page is safe" to the user.
It looks like this allows
one to spoof domain A quite successfully, unless I'm missing

It used to be that checking bounds on certain collections was less
efficient than waiting for the out of bounds exception. I think Joshua
Bloch discusses this in his book.
I've also seen this in generated code where you aren't sure of the
nature of the object you're indexing and thus don't know the
appropriate length variable (.length vs .length()).
That said it's still awful.
