Could the perpetrator have installed some kind of new firmware?But how?
Phones cannot be accessible by hijacking the 900mhz band...Only bluetooth could be your option, but the perpetrator should have been close to you...

Well yeah, there are some hacks for non-smart mobile phones, but they aren't as abundant as modern phone hacks.
Usually non smart phones lack a high performing microprocessor.So it is a bit hard to break in the firmware.
On the other hand, Android is far easier to break into since it is a Linux distribution and is largely open source.
