This looks like new packaging of an old/previously-announced product.
The NIST FIPS 140 site (
 does not list this device as having undergone any FIPS validation. And from the pictures and specs, it looks like what they did was to put one of their FIPS validated PCI cards into a 1U rack-mount format box -- along with one or two 10/100 Ethernet connections, an LCD display, keyboard input, and some other buttons and knobs (all of which have not gone through a FIPS validation no

@_subject: Other OpenSSL-based crypto modules FIPS 140 validated? 
While at the NIST FIPS 140 site earlier today (looking for that mysterious nCipher certificate), I noticed that certificate  was issued last Friday -- for "IBM Crypto for C (ICC)".
I think that the interesting thing about this crypto [SW] module and cert is that it's based on OpenSSL. I know we've discussed the [forthcoming] validation of OpenSSL itself, and we know about the Crypto++ and Netscape/Sun/Mozilla open source crypto modules, but my question now is, are there any other "OpenSSL-based" FIPS 140 validated crypto modules, or is this the first?
Disclaimer: although I'm employed by IBM, I had nothing to with this validation or with ICC (it's a big place)
