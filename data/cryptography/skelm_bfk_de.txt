Actually, for a couple of days now they didn't stop pointing out that
they were still running the PKI in a test environment and that only
'a few hundred test cards' are affected... Just stupid nonetheless...

From the interim report available at
   "Based on these conclusions, the CIAIAC is of the opinion that three
   safety barriers provided to avoid the take-off in an inappropriate
   configuration were defeated: the airplane configuration checklist,
   the checklist to confirm and verify the airplane's actual
   configuration, and the TOWS, which did not warn of the improper
   takeoff configuration."

I can confirm that, at least for XP SP3: revocation just doesn't
matter. What's even more worrying is the fact that one of the
stuxnet/tmphider variants used the lnk exploit to install a dll signed
w/ the (expired) Realtek key but w/ a *broken* signature in the first
place. Still, it doesn't matter altough, as wireshark tells me, the
host connects to microsoft.com in order to fetch certificates.
When looking at the file properties, though, Windows tells you
that "this digital signature is not valid" ...  :-(

I'm sure you remember Peter Honeyman's "PK-no-I" talk from
the '99 USENIX Security Symposium?  :-)

Would that really make that much of a difference? In Germany,
at least, the so-called "judge's approval" often isn't worth
a penny, esp. wrt. phone surveillance. It simply is way too
easy to get such an approval, even afterwards.
