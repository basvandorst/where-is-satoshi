On the same idea,
there is an expired Internet-Draft called "Link Fingerprints" :
I made some experiments around while used as Machine Tag/Triple Tag[1] :
to have an extension with OpenPGP detached signature.
Another potential use, it's to benefit from the number of users
checking the integrity and contribute back the computed
value into a "tagging" system like del.icio.us or any other
collaborative bookmarking.
I especially like the Firefox (or wget,curl) extension that
could compute the hash value and check it against various
contributed hashes. That could give a kind of confidence level
regarding the integrity of the file and its corresponding URL/URI.
Just some ideas,

It was a SoC project within Mozilla but seeing the following discussion :

Right... When I see the EV audit process[1], it looks to me like PCI DSS without
