@_subject: Identity Based Encryption 
I have had a look at Identity Based Encryption but I have not been able to
find out whether there are any protecting patents. It appears that the
breakthrough happend just two years ago with the work of Beneh and Franklin
[1] and there exist an open source implementation of their scheme (no GPL
though) from the same Applied Crypto Group at Stanford
Not sure whether the Voltage Security software, which was discussed on this
list back in July, is actually based on this very same implementation (I
think it is the same people). Does anybody know more about how "free" it is
to develop another IBE implementation? I know that HP also have their own
implementation of IBE, which is also not freely available. And there is
another IBE schema developed by Cocks [2] of which I haven't come across any
implementation yet
