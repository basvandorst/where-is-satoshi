@_subject: [Cryptography] DNSNMC deprecates Certificate Authorities and fixes 
Hi list,
Moving this into its own thread:
DNSNMC fixes the authentication problems previously described, and it addresses all of the problems that with the previously mentioned proposals. It does this first by combining DNS with Namecoin (NMC), and then by encouraging a ?trust only those you know? policy.5
?Namecoin is an open source decentralized key/value registration and transfer system based on Bitcoin technology?.[16] Namecoin ?squares Zooko?s Triangle?, meaning, it makes it possible to have domain names (and other types of identifiers) that are:
Authenticated: users can be certain that they are not speaking to an impostor
Decentralized: there is no central authority controlling all the names
Human-readable: names look just like today?s domain names
However, by itself, Namecoin does not provide the means by which ordinary users can take advantage of the features it provides. Using Namecoin is far too cumbersome for the vast majority of internet users, even those with years of computer expertise. For one, it cannot be used on mobile devices (like iPhones) in its current state because of its network requirements.
DNSNMC provides the missing ?glue? to the Namecoin blockchain that makes it immediately accessible to clients of all types with zero configuration. A network administrator need only enter the IP address of a DNSNMC-compliant DNS server to instantly make the information within the blockchain accessible to all of the users that she (or he) provides internet access to.

You've asked this question in two threads, but the question is more detailed in this thread, so I will copy and past my response here and to the other thread. For the future, please post your replies to the other, DNSNMC/okT-specific thread.
DNSNMC is an actual open source project (_not_ "product". It is not commercial). I will be posting the source to a github repo very soon, but as stated on the website, in the amount of time that it takes me to do that, you could have already written your own "pre-alpha implementation". It takes less than 100 lines of javascript to do that.
okTurtles is "a vision of a design" for an open source project (not product).
Zooko's triangle has been squared already by Namecoin, but there is no existing software that makes it simple for everyone to actually take advantage of this fact.
DNSNMC takes one step in that direction.
okTurtles takes yet another step.

Hey Ben,
Thank you for the link to this paper.
I needed to find the time to actually read this and get back to you. I've now done this.
You've posted this reply to a number of lists that we're both subscribed to, so I'm going to send this reply to each one:
My reply can be summarized (mostly) by Vladimir's response to your paper here:
For the list's sake, here are the salient points Sir Vladimir makes:
Than, first of all, he is trying to solve a non-problem and fails to see that issue he is trying to solve is not a bug but a feature.
This is in reference to your criticism of proof-of-work. Here's the rest of his comment on that particular point:
There is no problem with energy consumption, it is a very low price to
pay for getting rid of all the middlemen leaching a few percent from
every money transfer. Moreover, energy spent by miners on securing the
bloc chain is rather negligible in comparison to energy spent on other
ways to do money, when you consider, for example energy, required to
haul all the cash and gold in armoured trucks, smelting gold bullions,
coining coins, smelting metal for the bank vaults and so on...
Second criticism of your paper is as follows (again, I'll just copy Vlad's comments here):
Second of all, his "efficient solution" is very weak. Essentially, he
is proposing to replace voting weighted by pure computational power
(surely not very energy efficient way) to voting weighted by a number
of clients plugged into the network, without proposing any viable way
(since it is impossible) to ensure that this number of clients is not
faked. Therefore, he is effectively shifting proof-of-work concept
from doing lots of sha-256 calculations to opening lots of ports on
lots of IP's simultaneously. This could solve a problem of quick
propagations and wide distribution of information, but surely not a
problem of "double spending". Total epic fail!
Somehow, you seem to have completely missed the point of Bitcoin's proof-of-work. It's right there in the original paper:
The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote.
Vladimir made one final comment (not too important though, but I'll include it anyway):
He also has completely missed economic part of the system where
initial bitcoin inflation serves the purpose of subsidy to enable
quick growth of the network and making it secure from 50% attacks.
However, all of these points made by Vladimir do not destroy the point your paper makes entirely. They just badly bruise it.
IMO, the only legitimate criticism of Bitcoin contained in your paper is the following:
If, for example, 1% of the total power available7 is used to produce Bitcoins at present (in fact, the amount is far less than that), then at any point someone could come along with a further 1.1% of the total power and use this to define their own consensus8 , thus invalidating all the work, and all the money, of the initial group, and instead take possession of the entire currency for themselves.
This is referring to (or at least should be referring to) the idea of an attacker making their own "fake fork" that they control through superior-CPU power.
The strength of your argument (IMO) rests on this one issue: Whether or not there exists an attacker with the computational power necessary to take over the network.
This is a legitimate question, and combined with the observations made by Vladimir, it implies two takeaway points:
1. Your suggestion for an "efficient alternative" to Bitcoin appears to be inferior to Bitcoin because it appears to be based on one-IP-one-vote (rejected in the original paper).
2. Bitcoin's legitimacy and trustworthiness depends on whether or not there exists (or can exist) an entity with more horsepower than all more than 50% of the nodes on the network. This is old news.
The Bitcoin community has been discussing the 51% attack for a while and appears to be working on addressing the issue:
In case it's of interest to someone, here are two sites about known attacks on Bitcoin:

I included this link in my reply to you:
Proof of blockchain fair sharing is a draft Bitcoin protocol change proposal by Iain Stewart, with the goal of allowing the network to continue to settle on a sensible consensus blockchain even when subject to a considerably-greater-than-50% attack.
The protocol is under construction. The following description is a "teaser", establishing its basic flavour and sketching how it exploits an asymmetry in the goals of the honest (<50%) and malicious (>50%) miners to avoid the usual reductio ad absurdum argument against any protocol surviving a >50% attack. - Greg

I sometimes see things long these lines, though not whole sites going down.
Ex: yesterday I posted to CFRG asking whether their NSA-employed co-chair might be using a fake name, and the list's website took (what seemed to me) much longer to have that email posted online than my previous ones. It was as though the email got held somewhere for a while, and then released.
That said, Joshua is quite right when he says that your paranoia might be perfectly "justified" in the sense that malicious activity is going on, *and* that it might simply be coincidence.
However, paranoia can be fun, so go nuts:

I've used both phpBB and simplemachines, and far prefer the latter for its simpler configuration, administration, and what seem like superior spam-fighting capabilities.
The advantages are almost too numerous to list, and if people like getting the message via email then the software can be configured to include it in the notification emails that are sent out.
Forums are simply superior to mailing lists in almost all respects (perhaps all).
- Easier and faster to administer and moderate
- We don't have to wait for emails to be approved and show up
- Conversations are organized better
- Nobody complaining about "top posting", trimming "cruft" and other such nonsense
- An easy to search and read public log of all conversations
- Emoticons

@_subject: [Cryptography] DNSSEC = completely unnecessary? 
In all my readings on it I kept walking away thinking that I understood its purpose, but I'd then come back at myself with the same question: what does it give us over HTTPS?
I kept not being able to answer this question so I searched more, and eventually stumbled across these two comments on an article about DNSSEC:
Selected quotes:
Unfortunately, DNSSEC isn't actually providing additional security against a genuine MITM attack: SSL/TLS is still the weak link in the chain when DNSSEC is used!
DNSSEC plus SSL/TLS is therefore not defence in depth against general MITM attacks. No, that's precisely wrong. Cache poisoning isn't a serious threat if SSL/TLS is working correctly. In the presence of functional SSL/TLS, DNS cache poisoning can only produce a denial of service attack. The scenario we're trying to prevent is, "A thinks he is talking with B, but is actually talking with C." Cache poisoning can give A the address of C instead of B, which is a start, but C can't pass himself off as B unless he compromises the SSL/TLS process.
SSL/TLS provides end-to-end security. It catches DNS forgery. It catches route hijacking. It catches an arbitrary man in the middle. If SSL/TLS is working, every security compromise that DNSSEC can prevent has already been covered, and then some. What say you list? To me, the DNSSEC thing seems like it might be mostly a waste of a bunch of people's time.

I'm curious, what are these other protocols, and why can't they be secured simply by using SSL/TLS + some type of cert. verification?
Let's say that they can, and that it takes 1000 man hours to do this. Let's also assume that it takes 10x as much time to implement widespread DNSSEC use. Then why are we wasting all those man hours on implementing DNSSEC instead of using them to add SSL/TLS + cert. verification to other protocols?
Why is anyone still using HTTP?!? It's 2013!
Why does it cost any money to get an HTTPS cert?
These seem like more pressing problems to me.

@_subject: [Cryptography] DNSSEC = completely unnecessary + a bad idea? 
Here, I agree with you.
Where we disagree is in what we consider to be nails, hammers, and axes.
Finding good documentation on DNSSEC has proven to be difficult, but as far as I can tell, DNSSEC appears to be a sort of frankenstein re-implementation of the authentication aspects of SSL/TLS.
I've yet to see any compelling case that this is not so.
Well, duh. That's the bare minimum.
These are all basically the same issue (as far as I can tell), not five separate ones.
This issue (trust), has not been solved by HTTPS.
HTTPS does not guarantee trust.
Neither does DNSSEC though! (as far as I can tell)
DNSSEC appears to be doing basically the same type of "chain of trust" thing that CA's provide (and in a terribly broken way, I might add).
As far as I've been able to understand, it wants a trusted "root":
"So we need a way to have trusted keys (anchors) sign further keys, in hopes of one day having a signed root."
That's crazy-talk!
Who wants "a signed root"?!? I don't! Neither should anyone else!
Haven't we learned from HTTPS that trusting root CAs is a bad idea?
DNSSEC doesn't:
- encrypt your requests
- encrypt your data
- protect you from compromised root keys
What good is it?
Private keys should be treated nonchalantly. If one is compromised, the consequences shouldn't be dire or a pain-in-the-a**. Why? Because private key compromise _will happen_, especially with systems like DNSSEC and HTTPS that put so much importance on them.
And these guys are seriously trying to coordinate an "international effort" to switch to such a broken system?? Give me a break!
I can only hope that the complexity of DNSSEC, and the quarreling over who gets control over the master keys will keep it from ever being adopted or taken seriously.
The internet is a *NET*work. There is no place on a network for a single point of failure, and any actor burdened with the responsibility of holding "ultimate trust" _automatically_ and _necessarily_ becomes untrustworthy.

These, I believe, are using the same exact mechanism (and often, keys) for enc + auth, correct?
IMO they do a better job at auth than HTTPS and DNSSEC, cause at least with SSH there's no list of CA's to trust. Much harder to MITM it than HTTPS.
[ .. ]
OK, well, the solution isn't DNSSEC.
SMTP, DNS, NFS, printer protocols, et. al., need to be using encryption + authentication, and not relying on a handful of CAs for it.
DNSSEC is not the answer to these problems.
DNSSEC is yet another giant problem to which the answer is the garbage can.
We need to get rid of CAs completely.
The idea of all-important authority figures to determine who is and is not trustworthy sounds like it's coming straight out of some sort of dystopian novel.
Yes, we need an _authority_, but we can do completely without authority figures (and be better off).
The "ultimate authority" should not be some random third party machine sitting in a basement in god knows where. If there is an "ultimate authority", it's the individual/printer themselves, and no one else.
And when they are unable to speak for themselves, it should be the network itself, and not one that's arranged in any sort of hierarchical fashion with a "head boss" holding "master keys" at the top.

@_subject: [Cryptography] DNSSEC = completely unnecessary? 
It's possible my understanding has holes in it. Like I said, I've been having difficulty finding "good" documentation for it (in quotes because "good" means something different to everyone). I've been coming across a lot of dead links too, and even links to sites with bad certs (irony).
I've been going off of several documents and articles. One is the one originally linked to at the start of this thread, and here are some others:
"DNSSEC-bis for complete beginners (like me)":  "Seven Things You Should Know About DNSSEC": "Introduction to DNSSEC": And here are some quotes that led me to believe that the root plays a significant role.
From "Intro. to DNSSEC":
- "Make sure the root zone key can be trusted"
+- "Pointers in the root zone point to lower zones (com/org/info/de etc)"
+- "Each pointer is validated with the previous validated zone key"
- "Only the key for the root zone is needed to validate all the DNSSEC keys on the Internet"
- "How to update these keys and propagate them are not done yet"
From "Seven Things...":
- "The effort to implement DNSSEC for the root has renewed a longstand- ing debate about where ?control of the Internet? resides."
- "With DNSSEC, a series of encryption keys are handed off and authenticated?the second-level domain (SLD) key (from exam- ple.edu) is authenticated by the TLD (.edu), and the TLD key is authenticated by the root. In this way, when an SLD, its parent TLD, and the root are all signed, a chain of trust is created. (Holders of SLDs can implement DNSSEC before their TLD or the root is signed, creating so-called ?islands of trust? that rely on intermediate measures to validate their encryption keys.) If the encryption keys don?t match, DNSSEC will fail, but because the system is backwards-compatible, the transaction will simply follow standard DNS protocols.
The value of the system will come when the root, the TLDs, and SLDs are signed, allowing DNSSEC to be used for all Internet traffic. At that point, when DNSSEC fails, users will not be routed to bogus servers, and they might also be notified that nonmatching DNSSEC keys prevented their transaction from going through."
From "DNSSEC-bis for complete beginners...":
- "The second way is to have an existing 'anchor' sign your keys. In an ideal world the root-zone would be the anchor, and everything would flow from there."
- "We previously noted that we can designate keys as 'anchors', once we have verified their authenticity using non-DNS means. It is impracticable to do this for all millions of domains though. So we need a way to have trusted keys (anchors) sign further keys, in hopes of one day having a signed root."
So... I don't quite understand what you mean by:
That sounds like manually adding root certs to your system's keychain to me. Nobody (other they neck-beards) does that. In practice, browsers come with pinned certs that they trust, and any of these root certs can say "yes". How will DNSSEC work in practice for users?

This is a bit too vague for me to understand how it would work in practice. Perhaps the RFC goes into more detail, but I'd rather spend my time on researching less broken systems right now.
Someone sent me a link that led me to this page on DNSSEC failures, and some choice quotes:
Here's two from Moxie (now I know I'm in good company):
"So unfortunately the DNSSEC trust relationships depend on sketchy organizations and governments, just like the current CA system. Worse, far from providing increased trust agility, DNSSEC-based systems actually provide reduced trust agility."
"We had this map of the EFF's SSL Observatory data on what countries are currently capable of intercepting secure communication under the CA system. Under [DNSSEC/DANE], it would look like this."
(He shows a completely red map, indicating all countries)

The basics would be to not use the CAs. Working on rest of details, they're mostly finished, just gotta make 'em nice 'n pretty. And some code would be good, too.
Is it OK if I just copy/paste my response from the IETF list here? I think it answers your question.
Below the row of equals signs, is an email that was the other list. You can also read it at this archived link: On Nov 13, 2013, at 10:04 PM, Mark Nottingham  wrote
Thanks Mark, and thanks for the off-list email, I thought it was brilliant. As time permitted, I pursued some of the links you sent, and I especially liked the "Tao of the IETF". ^_^
Again, apologies for criticizing the proposal without providing any explanation. I finished reading the RFC and have written down my observations and objections below:
1. $$$
Who's going to pay for these certs that nobody actually needs (because of authentication methods that don't need CAs), and why is this unnecessary and annoying financial burden being placed on anyone who wants to run a world-facing HTTP/2.0 server?
2. $$$ + The Terrorist Lurking Just Behind the Corner?
What happens if a monopoly appears (imagine your worst nightmare, a monopoly of monopolies: Symantec+Verizon+ATT+AOL Time Warner), and all of a sudden starts to either:
1. Gobble up the browser vendors and/or put them on their payroll; or,
2. Lobby their way through the legislative bodies of the world to force us to use their certs Because Terrorism? ?
Yeah, that's a bit of a loony scenario, but it's actually possible thanks to the silly idea of Certificate Authorities.
3. Annoying Small Businesses
Is it possible that a danger exists whereby some people (certain nuisance-type small business) might end up kicked off the net because HTTP 1.0 has "successfully" been migrated over to HTTP/2.0 and the Internet Identity Verification Bureaucracy (slogan: "May I see your papers plz?!?") cannot seem to find the application they sent in last month?
Yet another loony-toons scenario brought to you by: Certificate Authorities.
(I know, I know, "Not our problem, leave it to the TLS guys to fix later". I address this below.)
4. Cultivating Apathy and Enabling Fascists
Will adopting a protocol (TLS) that is known to provide inadequate security put a roadblock on the path to implementing real security in web browsers?
I'm rather concerned that, having successfully upgraded their browsers to the brand-spanking shiny new HTTP/2.0 goodness, people will have little enthusiasm for dismantling the basis of the authentication system that TLS uses (Certificate Authorities).
Instead, it might go something like this:
"Yeah! Go us! We made the web encrypted! We're... Encryption Heroes!!"
Objections raised by the nerds in tinfoil hats will be brushed aside with the words such as, "adequate". After all, why bother addressing these technicalities when we all see so many users smiling at all the shining lock icons all over the net?
Symantec/VeriSign's executives will also be smiling, even wider smiles, because they get to literally print money as if they were suddenly the Federal Reserve. "Oh, you want a key? Here you go, that'll be $20, come back same time next year to renew your security subscription!"
This is essentially fraud. They are selling a "product" that takes approximately zero effort to create, and they get to charge annual fees for it while promising security that does not actually exist. Meanwhile, the cold creep of the surveillance state settles down upon the quiet town...
5. Conclusion and RFC The intent expressed on this list by Mark and the browser vendors seems quite noble, but anytime the security issue is brought up, all I've seen is it being pushed aside to "another working group".
OK, that's perfectly fine, but let them do their work, and leave the security decisions to them.
There exist many proposals for how to fix this situation. The ones that I think will work all involve getting rid of the CAs. That, properly implemented, would do the trick.
But I haven't heard from any browser vendor, or any IETF Greybeard, that putting the CAs on the chopping block is part of the plan.
That does not mean I'm against businesses being able to monitor company traffic (with consent and knowledge of their employees, etc.). Said alternative proposals can be (and some are) able to do such administrivia. We don't need CA to do that, however.
Therefore, I propose a fourth alternative (to the three existing ones).
Option D: Do nothing.
This is not a problem for this WG to solve. Don't give TLS any novel treatment until it is fixed. Leave the security details to Security Details, and when it's fixed, work together with them on how to use it with HTTP/2.0.
Lao Tze would approve.
The pros of this approach:
1. The problem remains like a painful thorn in everyone's backside, gnawing at our collective subconscious.
That's exactly as it should be. "Fake fixes" aren't fixes.

I agree, I apologize for the excessively negative tone. I think RL (and unrelated) agitation affected my writing and word choice. I've taken steps to prevent that from happening again (via magic of self-censoring software).
Thanks! ^_^
I don't see why a one-time-password is necessary. Just check the headers to verify that the send-path was the same as it was on the original request.
Somebody used the phrase "repeat after me" previously. I'll give it a shot too:
"Repeat after me": Sending *any* user password (no matter how unimportant /you/ think it is) in the clear is extremely poor practice and should never be done.
And, if a password is completely unnecessary, it should not be used.
On a side-note (Re: Russ's email and others), I can't believe people are talking about encryption and key distribution algorithms in reference to this topic.

You're right, I think I misunderstood you when you talked about a "one time password". I thought you were referring to something users would have to come up with.
If by "one time password" you mean a server-generated token, then yes, that would be far better.
That's standard practice for most mailing lists. The token is usually a unique challenge link sent back to the user, and they can either click on it or reply to the message while quoting the link in the body. Sometimes it's also a unique number in the subject line.

@_subject: [Cryptography] DNSChain 0.1.0 adds DANE/TLSA support for blockchain 
Good day list,
Just published this to NPM and thought it might interest some here.
DNSChain is a DNS + HTTP(S) + Blockchain-proxy hybrid server designed to serve as a decentralized and distributed secure replacement for Certificate Authorities and X.509 PKI.
It's also designed to act as a secure public key distribution system for both websites and identity systems.
Today, with the help of various contributors, we released version 0.1.0:
New Features:
DANE/TLSA support for BOTH canonical DNS and blockchain DNS!
Added NO_OLD_DNS option for oldDNSMethod (refuses all non-blockchain queries)
Redesigned dns.coffee and improved its structure
Accurate ttl values now returned for namecoin DNS queries based on expires_in field
Updated contributors, code and config examples in README.md
Improved EDNS support
Improved handling of ANY queries
Updated dependencies to latest versions
native-dns is now fetched from the dnschain branch of our fork.
Comments added all over the place (to native-dns & related projects also!)
Many other code improvements both to DNSChain and the NodeJS native-dns module
Some performance improvements
Fixed broken grunt example
Fixed some uncaught exceptions (issues  and Fixed broken NAPTR support
DNSChain license is now MPL-2.0 (applies to version 0.1.0 onward)
Default logging level is now info
It's compatible with most UNIX-like systems (including OS X) and can be installed via the NPM package manager or manually via Git.
Free public servers (including ones that support DNSCrypt), along with instructions for installing and running DNSChain, is available on its GitHub page:

Hey Ben,
I want to apologize to you, because I think I've changed my mind about the 51% problem.
Previously, from the reading I had done on the subject, I had come to the conclusion that this is a problem that was being addressed (or would be addressed in the near future).
Now, after having spoken with Emin G?n Sirer (author of the "Majority is not Enough: Bitcoin Mining is Vulnerable" paper), as well as some of the core developers of Bitcoin, I've changed my mind about this, and will be updating the okturtles.com site to reflect this slight change in position.
From my conversations with the bitcoin devs, I've come to the conclusion that they do not care about this problem enough to put much serious effort into fixing it. They appear to be mostly ignoring it.
Their "solution" to it is Getblocktemplate (GBT): GBT is not a solution, however.
It is a monkey patch, and doesn't prevent the problem from happening. It merely makes it more difficult to put into practice, but provides no guarantees.
Imagine someone driving really fast with one hand on the wheel, while covering their face with the other and peeping at the road of ahead of them between their fingers. That is Bitcoin right now.
All that is not to say that I have lost faith in this approach. Indeed, there are approaches that use a blockchain that *DO* actually fix this problem (NXT is an example). However, they come with their own problems.
It's a work in progress, but as far as I know it's the best we've got right now.

Dear Tony,
We've already acknowledged on twitter [1] the fact that this class of attack does not work on blockchains and DNSChain.
That is for two reasons:
1. With blockchains, only the owner of a domain can update SSL certificates. With CT and X.509, your domain does not belong to you exclusively, and therefore thousands of others can create SSL certs for your domain.
2. With blockchains, censorship or DoS to the P2P network can only prevent nodes from receiving updates, it does not make them forget what they've already learned. Since most SSL certs are long-lived, the threat is far less significant than it is with CT.
Kind regards,

Dear Dmitry,
Thank you for the reply.
Well, please reply with the details of gossip.
This blog post was simply a more formal way of restating an email I'd brought up on [trans] back in May.
I pointed out back then that gossip was essential if this attack is to have any hope of being detected, and I am still waiting for those details.
Define "much more"? If we're dealing with "the perfect MITM", they might own one of the CAs, and then only need to send an NSL to another (or hack another). Not too difficult for "the perfect MITM".
Kind regards,

1. It does not.
2. Even if it did, that would still be a problem, as it's not "Mossad", it's NSA, GCHQ, and yes, they are probably MITMing your connection right now as we speak :P.
All that's necessary to pull of this attack (currently) is just one rouge Clog (CA/log combo).
Say the RFC changes and requires two SCTs.
You only need one rouge Clog for the attack to work and be undetected.
1. Rouge Clog creates fraudulent cert and SCT
2. It sends the cert to another log (a good one), thus obtaining two SCTs
3. It MITMs connections to the website
4. Gossip proceeds as normal. Nothing is blocked. All clients see the correct STHs for the Clog.
5. Clog finishes its dirty business and re-instates the original certificate.
Before, during, and after the attack, all clients see the correct STHs, get their Merkle consistency and audit proofs from the clog, and proceed like normal.
The only thing that could detect this are the Monitors, but they aren't going to save you because they would need to monitor *all* logs for *all* domains and alert *everyone* about those changes (difficult enough, you'd need a... b-b-b-blockchain!) and get those alerts safely (without censorship or tampering) to everyone on Earth.
More info:
Yes, Game Over for Certificate Transparency.
Maybe the blockchain can save it, but if it does, people will realize that they don't need Certificate Transparency, so it's Game Over either way.

This attack is not similar for the following reasons:
- Here, the attacker would need to continue to MITM the connection between Alice and Bob indefinitely, and that would incidentally require mining blocks for the *sole purpose* of MITMing Alice.
- This attack is trivially detectable by Alice. The second Alice checks a node/service that is not being MITM'd by the attacker (like blockchain.info), or speaks with Bob over some other channel, Alice would know she was being attacked.
In CT:
- The attack is not trivially detected once it is over.
- It does not require any extra efforts (like mining) other than issuing a fraudulent cert and using it to MITM.

That's not what I'm saying at all.
I'm saying their trees work like Merkle trees are supposed to work, and that none of their proofs detect mis-issued certificates.
The two certs (legit and false) will happily live side-by-side in the tree undetected by the gossip protocol.

What do you mean by "network partition"?
Maybe this will help, go to Google's "How Log Proofs Work" page:
Look at the little green boxes that represent certificates.
So, one of those green boxes will be a legitimate certificate, and the other will be the fraudulent one.
Neither consistency nor audit proofs will let a client know whether or not the cert they're being shown is fraudulent or not, and that is even when both of them are in the same log (which they don't have to be).
Gossip just sends the little red boxes between the server and the clients. They don't matter.

Um, OK, that is not the attack being described though.
Forks are protected against by PoW. It is automatic. If the connection is completely censored, and they are shown only a false fork that the MITM is making, that has already been brought up and addressed by myself and Bear in previous emails.

Ah, now you're talking sense. :-)
I really don't think that, and it's discussed in the blog post:
51% attack is a legitimate problem that can result in censorship of the network.
Note that it doesn't allow the NSA to lie about a certificate though. In many ways, 51% attack is just another form of censorship. They would probably prefer to just censor the connection.
Details of what 51% allows and does not allow are copied here from the bitcoin wiki:
An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows him to:
Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
The attacker can't:
Reverse other people's transactions
Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
Change the number of coins generated per block
Create coins out of thin air
Send coins that never belonged to him

There is only a tiny window where this could happen, making it unlikely to happen in the first place.
That window is before Alice has registered her name in the blockchain.
The attacker would have to somehow anticipate the instant when Alice goes to register her name or domain name in the blockchain and replace it with a fake one, while showing Alice the one Mallory created in the fake fork, and then doing that for perpetuity, following Alice as she goes from Wifi to Wifi, and still Alice will likely detect the attack as per the previous discussion.
Completely. Different.

OK, interesting, that I haven't seen before in any CT documentation.
If that's how it worked then the MITM would need to consistently filter all traffic to hide those reports back to the server (they'd end up needing to perpetually MITM in other words). That would be difficult to do.
Is there any documentation on the details of this? This could be done for today's TLS actually and would be useful.
I suspect this might go up against Laurie's "Must be fast" criteria though, as it would add more overhead to each TLS connection.
What do you mean by "validated by a handful of independent logs", could you elaborate on that? What part of CT is that in reference to?

No, that is not true.
The SCTs in the certificate are the ones the MITM puts there.
They are not the ones you're thinking of (that whatever trustworthy entity chose).

One more thing:
Furthermore, the SCTs don't matter to begin with, as has been repeatedly explained in this thread and elsewhere.
Creating a bogus cert doesn't need to result in any fork of a log. The log will be shown to everyone, they'll run their proofs, and they'll see that the certificate is legitimate even though it is not.
The only person who decides whether the certificate is legitimate or not is the domain owner.
Nobody else.
Currently, nothing in the CT proposal detects these MITM attacks, before, during, or after they happen.
The one thing that might help is if the SCTs are gossiped upon change:
That would require changing how TLS works, and actually could be done without implementing much else besides gossip.

(*that is, nothing automatically detects the attacks. As explained in prior emails, Monitors could query all of the logs and search all of them for mis-issued certs, and that's problematic for reasons previously explained.)

Dear Rich,
In this particular example, there is a third option that is more likely to happen than either of the two you've presented: Verisign will say they were hacked, and that their private keys were used without their consent or knowledge.
The damage will have been done to the victims (who get no recourse), and the money and efforts to deploy CT will have been spent (and wasted, IMO).
Verisign is also but one small slice of the pie of potential malicious actors (see the diagrams in the blog post for a more complete picture).

Dear Paul,
I called it "Google's CT" as a convenience to the reader in order to distinguish it from other implementations of certificate transparency, namely blockchain certificate transparency.
I did not "purposefully ignore" that it's being developed as part of an IETF working group.
My understanding is that this was originally conceived of, and funded by, Google, so I called it "Google's CT". If I'm mistaken about that, please let me know.
Also, if you know of a more accurate way of distinguishing between the different types of certificate transparency I would be happy to update the article. As the article is for a semi-lay audience, it would be appreciated if you could keep the terminology simple and accurate.
"IETF CT", for example, has too many acronyms and could conflict with potential future IETF working groups (if such groups decide to create other implementations of CT).
When we discussed the idea of sharing SCTs between browsers and servers on the [trans] list back in September of 2014 [1], I thought that the idea had been dismissed. I did not know it was later picked up by the group. My apologies for having missed the publication of this document earlier in the month.
[1] Reading over it, I still have several concerns, which I will voice here but let me know if it would be better to also voice them on [trans].
In Section 3.1.1, it says:
HTTPS servers MUST perform a number of sanity checks on SCTs from
   clients before storing them:
   1.  if a bit-wise compare of the SCT matches one already in the
       store, discard
   2.  if the SCT can't be verified to be a valid SCT for the
       accompanying leaf cert, issued by a known log, discard
   3.  if the leaf cert is not for a domain that the server is
       authoritative for, discard
   Check number 1 is a pure optimisation.  Check number 2 is to prevent
   spamming and attacks where an adversary can fill up the store prior
   to attacking a client.  Check number 3 is to help misbehaving clients
   from leaking what sites they visit.
Concern  Discarding invalid SCTs
It is not clear to me what's going on in (2) above.
- How is the server verifying the SCT for validity?
- Why is the server discarding the SCT if it is invalid?
Wouldn't discarding an invalid SCT totally undermine the point of clients sharing them?
Concern  The use of the word SHOULD
The doc states:
(with ref to server => auditor comms):
HTTPS servers SHOULD share all SCTs and certificate data they see
   that pass the checks above
Auditors SHOULD provide the following URL accepting HTTPS POSTing of
   SCT feedback data:
Auditors SHOULD regularly poll HTTPS servers at the well-known sct-
   feedback URL.  How to determine which domains to poll is outside the
   scope of this document
As per RFC2119, "SHOULD" means the advice is free to be ignored after the implications are "carefully weighed".
This means that so far the document provides no guarantees that a misbehaving log will be caught.
It is also disconcerting that instead of taking direct action themselves, servers are supposed to initiate yet another HTTPS connection to an auditor. This is cumbersome and will probably leave open holes for a global MITM to prevent SCTs from reaching auditors, yet again undermining the entire point of sharing SCTs.
While it's definitely a positive sign that the sharing of SCTs and certificate chains is now an official recommendation, I am concerned that the particular implementation is without any teeth to deliver concrete results, and so until these concerns are addressed I am not convinced that the problem has been fully addressed.
Yes, as per the new Experimental Internet-Draft discussed above, I see that this has changed since I last looked.
I will therefore update this part of the blog post (hopefully later today after I get back from a doctor's appointment which I've gotta run to).
Thanks you for pointing that out and for addressing this concern. I want to make sure that everything we say about CT is accurate and up-to-date.
There's more than one way to skin a blockchain*, so you may want to read about other consensus mechanisms (like bonded proof of stake) that do not require spending significant CPU power.
Alternatively, you may also want to support green power initiatives.
