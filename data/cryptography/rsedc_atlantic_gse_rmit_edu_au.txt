@_subject: Challenge to David Wagner on TCPA 
'Applications' as used in Wagner's statement can be actions
or computer programs to accomplish the desired tasks for the
  Application \Ap`pli*ca"tion\, n. [L. applicatio, fr. applicare:
     cf. F. application. See {Apply}.]
     3. The act of applying as a means; the employment of means to
        accomplish an end; specific use.
     3: a program that gives a computer instructions that provide
        the user with tools to accomplish a task;
Both involve using the term 'accomplish'.
Whereas from WordNet (r) 1.7 [wn]:
  software
       n : (computer science) written programs or procedures or rules
           and associated documentation pertaining to the operation
           of a computer system and that are stored in read/write
           memory;
As you can see, 'application' differs from 'software' in that an
'application' needs to 'accomplish' the desired tasks.
If as you said later,
that the desired tasks cannot be accomplished, then the software might run
but the 'application' does not.
Note the TPM FAQ quoted is correct in using the term 'software' but that
is not the term used by Wagner. The sentence where the term 'application'
is used in the alleged Palladium White Paper might appear to be self
Therefore I do not think that Wagner needs to withdraw his claim.

@_subject: Palladiated? (was re: wow - palladiated! (Re: Palladium: technical limits and implications)) 
And the antonym? Odyssielded. Rhymes with shielded.
Odysseus was the first to learned the Palladium Oracles from the Seer Hellenus.
Odysseus neutralised (neutronised?) Palladium's defence for Troy.
Odysseus invented the first Trojan Horse.
Incidentally public revelation of the Palladium is supposed to be on
Seventh Day to the Ides of Jun, i.e. 8th. June. The Newsweek article was
a bit late.

'LaGrandium' and the Dark Side of 'Trusted' Computing
  By  Jason Brook
  On Monday, Intel introduced its development forum attendees to LaGrande, a trusted
  computing technology slated for inclusion in future Intel processors, perhaps as soon as the
  middle of next year.   Intel's LaGrande-based processor chips (AMD plans to include similar features in its own
  chips) are supposed to team with a future Microsoft OS technology called Palladium to
  deliver a more controllable-and therefore more secure-computing platform than we have
  today.
  Now, whether these "trusted" platforms will result in more security and control
  for the individual computer user remains to be seen.   The trusted computing platform that Intel and Microsoft are countenancing
  would be built around a protected memory space in which trusted services run, a
  sealed storage mechanism for storing encrypted data, and a facility for providing
  operating environment information to outside parties.  In Microsoft's Palladium
  materials, those outside parties are called "external requestors."
