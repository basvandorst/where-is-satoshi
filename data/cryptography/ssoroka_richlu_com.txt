Which prompts the question, what the hell for?
Sounds like an incredible abuse of power.  Do you think they have 20,000
warrants to back that up?  If so, why is Germany so full of criminals?

re article:
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this extremely bad? Don't they realize
the system fails if they send more than one photon? the redundancy allows an
attacker with sensitive equipment to read a single photon (or maybe a few)
without the receiving end noticing! (Due to their fancy less-sensitive,
error correcting receiver) This renders the whole system completely useless
for cryptographic purposes.
Hope they didn't spend too much money developing it.
