Can you point us where can we found the MSVC-C standard as I dare to
find the definitive definition of "common-sense" I was looking for when
someone once tell me such could be found in "The Hitch Hicker Guide to
the Galaxy", or was it "non-sense", I dunno.
Anyway, if MSVC promises to interpret C standard in a specific way,
this should be written somewhere as a contract to not break code
relying on such interpretations.
And source codes relying on such interpretation cannot be declared to
be written in C, hence, are no more portable, which is a pity.

If one would give a try with BeagleBone[1], there's CryptoCape[2][3],
then you have to trust Atmel's RNG implementation [4] ...
Reading ATSHA204 datasheet [5] doesn't make me confident the RNG
provided by this chip is really a True HardWare backed RNG, it sounds
more like a PRNG with per device unique seed.

Just found this surprising project: "The Global Consciousness Project"
"When human consciousness becomes coherent, the behavior of random
 systems may change. Random number generators (RNGs) based on quantum 
 tunneling produce completely unpredictable sequences of zeroes and 
 ones.
 But when a great event synchronizes the feelings of millions of 
 people, our network of RNGs becomes subtly structured."
I'm forward looking for post Quantum, post Conscious cryptography :)

Linux's /dev/urandom is a CSPRNG: it's designed to be cryptographically
strong. If correctly initialized, it garanties "good randoms".
That's one drawback of /dev/urandom versus getrandom(): without
GRND_RANDOM, the syscall might block when called early after kernel
boot, as the underlying CSPRNG will wait for some entropy to be
gathered. Once initialized, it should like /dev/urandom.
Except for long term keys, one should not need "/dev/random".

It's "only" a boot problem (albeit a big issue).
As soon as "enough" entropy is gathered, the kernel CSPRNG "well"
seeded, /dev/random and /dev/urandom output are of equal quality.
Anyway getrandom(,, 0) should be prefered now as:
1) it blocks until the kernel CSPRNG is seeded, eliminating the boot
issue, (except when you're PID 1, in charge of initializing the
2) doesn't block after that.
3) doesn't require opening a file
Entropy tracking done for /dev/random is controversial.
