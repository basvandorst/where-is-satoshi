I've written a "food for thought" kind of article around the usage of
cryptocurrencies for universal basic income (
And, although this is not 100% on topic, I would definitely like some
opinions around usage of biometrics for key generation. More precisely on:
   - Do you think it will be possible, at some point, to have some sort of
   biometric public key infrastructure, where public and private keys are
   directly pegged to a persons biometric details?
   - Could biometrics completely replace the need for passwords?
   - If compromise of biometric details occurs, how would one go around to
   solve this, since it's not possible to, for example, create a new
   fingerprint for a person?
Thank you,

Thank you. That definitely makes a lot of sense.
So, taking into consideration that there will always be a need to generate
some sort of secret, thus a very specific point of failure, is it fair to
assume that the "security in depth" approach will always be present, for
ever and ever?
I know this might seem like a very naive question, just curious to get some
more points of view.

Thank you for replying.
Your point would be: biometrics are good to generate secrets, but not good
to serve as secrets. Is that correct?
I definitely understand your point, and today's limitations, but what I'm
trying to get at here is the possibility of completely removing the need of
physical, or digital, secrets (thus the whole "biometrical PKI"). By the
end, this is the main point of failure. If someone gets to my secret, I'm
It seems that this is impossible with current technology. Am I being
utopian, or could this possible happen?
