Through the biting wind of a Cleveland Winter, I saw Anton Stiglic write:
Yes, that's true for home or personal use, but in a large organization, mail is likely to go through multiple SMTP servers before it reaches the server which hosts the user's mailbox.  At my previous company, a piece of mail destined for a foreign address saw at least two and sometimes three SMTP servers on the way out; an inbound message from the outside saw at least three.  Each of these servers will need to write to the message headers.
Then there are the situations where you are at a company or university or something and they have locked down the outbound policies and it is impossible to initiate an outbound SMTP connection on port 25 or 465.  In those situations, one *must* use the local SMTP server, even if it's not the ideal one.

Once upon a time, bear sent Kevin a note that said...
Win2k and WinXP have a cache for the resolver.  To show it, type 'ipconfig /displaydns' in a command prompt.   To clear it (which is a good troubleshooting tactic) us 'ipconfig /flushdns'

Is delivery really the problem, though?  You can deliver all the code you want to an e-mail account which I check using pine and none of it will ever run.  I think that the problem is that the mail clients in question have the ability to interpret the code.  HTML?  It's text-only, but contains a number of features that, when implemeted, produce what I think we'd all call undesirable results.
I could send a message that says:
helo somenastydomain.com
mail from spammer at nowhere.net
rcpt johndoe at yahoo.com
here's some viagra I'd like to sell you
