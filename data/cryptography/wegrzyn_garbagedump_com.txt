@_subject: DRM technology and policy 
Boy has this gone on for a long time. It is a very religious issue. Let me start out by saying that I was once the CTO of a DRM company - Authentica. Now with that said here is how I see it. DRM can be viewed in a totally different way. It is meant to keep most of the people "honest" but will never stop those that really want at the content. If you look at it this way you will see that you don't need to worry about stopping every instance just make it hard enough that 80% (90%?) of the people can't crack it.
We all know on this list that nothing is completely secure, regardless of how hard you try. Whatever the mind of man can create someone can figure out how to get around it.

True enough. I come from the world in which DRM is only used for private communications and never on digital entertainment. In my world we were concerned with protecting private emails, (PDF)  documents and web sites. As I said the rule in that space isn't to make it impossible to crack but only pretty hard.

This is the same approach used in the Authentica system but it is deployed in an enterprise environment.

Martin, I understand your reluctance. I don't like this mechanism either and I was the CTO of Authentica!

From my very practical position ( I was the CTO of Authentica and responsible for their email and web technology) there are truths to the email from Ian. Though I will also state that their is a very real segment of the marketplace which does require a user to have secure messaging while the corporation might not.

Actually i would imagine that banks could have such a trusted position. They haven't done anything in the space but I am sure they will at some The problem isn't them holding the key but once it is in the hands of a third party it could easily be gotten to by the government (through a court order or under the US Patriot Act).

Zooko, I don't think you actually need to worry about the At-Most-Once semantics you example below. This sort of stuff has been around for decades and there are a number of open source programs available. Don't confuse what TLS does - transport messages securely end-to-end - to what the end points do with them. We don't need to have another protocol which includes TLS+At-Most-Once semantics. I'd say that would be a terrible idea.
