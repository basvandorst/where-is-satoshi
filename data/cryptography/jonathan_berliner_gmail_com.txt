FYI – NIST announces FIPS 202 (the SHA-3 Standard) and FIPS 180-4 in
the Federal Register today.  Please see the Federal Register Notice
for details and for NIST’s comment resolutions for DRAFT FIPS 202 and
DRAFT FIPS 180-4.
FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions
August 5, 2015
NIST published a Federal Register Notice, 80 FR 46543, on August 5,
2015 announcing the approval of FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard:
Permutation-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions, and a Revision
of the Applicability Clause of FIPS 180-4, Secure Hash Standard.
FIPS 202 specifies the SHA-3 family of hash functions, as well as
mechanisms for other cryptographic functions to be specified in the
future.  The revision to the Applicability Clause of FIPS 180-4
approves the use of hash functions specified in either FIPS 180-4 or
FIPS 202 when a secure hash function is required for the protection of
sensitive, unclassified information in Federal applications, including
as a component within other cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
