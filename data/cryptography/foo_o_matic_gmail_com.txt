@_subject: Which book for a newbie to cryptography? 
Hi, first im new to this list and to cryptography. :)
I've read the first lesson from this 24 crypto lessons:
and found it really interesting. I want to start learning cryptography
from a book, and I have access to these 3 books from the library in
the college near me:
- Handbook of applied cryptography / Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van
Oorschot, Scott A. Vanstone / 1996
- Cryptography : theory and practice 2nd ed. / Douglas R. Stinson / 2002
What I want to know is which one is recommended for someone which is
new to cryptography?
Thanks in advance,

Hi, it's me again.
first, thank you for all the answers. second, im sorry for the lack of
details, I should have added some info, which is:
1. I'm a 2nd year student of BA in Computer Science, I finished 5
courses, 3 in Programming (Intoduction A to Computer Science,
Introduction B to Computer Science, and Software Development in UNIX
[in all of them we were writing codes in C] ) and 2 courses in math
(Discrete Math 1 and Discrete Math 2). so basically that is my
mathematical knowledge. also now im about to start the courses
Differential and Integral math, and Linear math.
2. I went to the online Library Catalog and searched for the keyword
"Cryptography", and these were the results:
- Cryptography : theory and practice: 2nd ed. / Douglas R. Stinson
- Defending your digital assets against hackers, crackers, spies and
thieves / Randall K. Nichols, Daniel J. Ryan, Julie J. C. H. Ryan
- Cryptography and network security : principles and practice /
William Stallings
- Handbook of applied cryptography / Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van
Oorschot, Scott A. Vanstone
- Practical cryptography for data internetworks / William Stallings
- Disappearing cryptography : being and nothingness on the Net / Peter Wayner
- Protect your privacy : the PGP user's guide / William Stallings
- Cryptography : theory and practice: 1st ed. / Douglas R. Stinson
As you can see, no Schneier here.
That's it, I think that's all what I wanted to add.
So now what book do you recommend?
Thanks alot in advance,

Ok, I have read both yours and Sandy Harris's replies, and looked
again at my previous message, and the opinions are kinda ambiguous.
I think I will go to the library and pick one of them.
anyway, I don't feel I need a book that gets very or too deep, because
I really don't have much time for that. I just need a good book which
will teach me the main and important things, and won't be too much
mathy (altho I passes the Discrete Math 1 and 2 courses, I don't
really like it, maybe except combinatorics and that theory with P Q's,
and T(), F()'s (I don't know its name in english, it isn't my native
well thanks for the help so far, you have all been very helpful.
