@_subject: Double Encryption Q 
Quick system scenario:
You have packet [A].
It gets encrypted using an AES algo in a particular mode and we are
left with [zA].
More data [B] is added to that encrypted packet.
Now I have [zA]+[B] in one packet and I re-encrypt it with the same
Have I just compromised the security somehow? I wasn't aware of
anything but something about this double encryption made something
ring in my mind so I wanted to double check...
Many thanks,
Mr Pink

There are high assurance systems that exist that do eactly this. There
are two different implementations of the security unit processing the
same data. The outputs are compared by a seperate high assurance and
validated module that enters into an alarm mode should the outputs
However, these are generally costly affairs, you need to pay two
implementation teams etc, therefore remain the luxury of only the most
critical systems.
For hardware, this

@_subject: RNG for Padding 
This may be out of the remit of the list, if so a pointer to a more
appropriate forum would be welcome.
In Applied Crypto, the use of padding for CBC encryption is suggested
to be met by ending the data block with a 1 and then all 0s to the end
of the block size.
Is this not introducing a risk as you are essentially introducing a
large amount of guessable plaintext into the ciphertext.
Is it not wiser to use RNG data as the padding, and using some kind of
embedded packet size header to tell the system what is padding?
Thanks for your suggestions,
Mr Pink
