See   A vulnerability in PGP's display of key validity has been discovered   that could allow an attacker to fool users into thinking that a valid   signature was created by what is actually an invalid user ID. If the   attacker can obtain a signature on their key from a trusted third   party, they can then add a second user ID to their key which is   unsigned. The attacker must then switch the unsigned false user ID to   primary and convince the victim to place the key on their keyring. In   such a case, some of the displays in PGP do not properly identify the   false user ID as invalid because the second user ID is fully valid.   Whenever PGP displays validity information on a per-user ID basis,   the display is correct. Thus, attentive users who examine the user   IDs of all public keys which they import to their keyrings will   immediately notice this problem before it could have any impact.   This issue was discovered and reported to Network Associates/PGP   Security, Inc. by Sieuwert van Otterloo.

@_subject: Quantum crypto broken? 
Would anybody with more knowledge care to comment on this?
This article leads one to believe that one can eavesdrop without being
detected and with nearly 5/6ths confidence of the data on a quantum crypto
communication. This is in contrast to the claim to fame of quantum crypto
that the receiver will know if there is an eavesdropper. (This is what makes
quantum crypto work when all public key crypto gets broken.)
Quantum crypto has "1 photon"="1 bit" with the polarization of the photon
giving the 1 or 0 of the bit.
It seems photon polarization state can be duplicated with nearly 5/6th
  Near-perfect copies of single photons have been made in   the lab for the first time...
  The Oxford team sent a photon from one such pair [of   entangled photons] into an optically active crystal   where it stimulated the emission of a further photon.   There is an increased chance that the new photon will   have the same polarization as the 'input' photon. In   contrast, photons that are emitted spontaneously are   equally likely to be in either polarization state. There is also an abstract at:

But, how do they power it?
  An OPSECURE PROTECTED CD looks like a
  regular CD but contains a smart card and
  optical input-output system...
  An OpSecure protected media does not
  only reflect stamped or burnt information
  but can also RECEIVE, STORE, PROCESS,
  and TRANSMIT INFORMATION....
  It is impracticable to
  crack since it is hardware based and is
  based on dynamic protection
Also mentioned but no further insight:

@_subject: RSA getting rid of trusted third parties? 
I came across this interesting announcement by RSA:
Particularly from the above announcement:
   By using this solution, customers' Web server certificates    generated and issued by their RSA Keon Certificate Authority    (CA) software are designed to be automatically validated -    and therefore trusted - by popular Web browsers, e-mail    packages and other applications that leverage the recognized    issuer lists of these Web browsers.
This announcement appears to completely break down the trust model assuming
anybody can host a Keon CA that will issue trusted certificates.

@_subject: RSA getting rid of trusted third parties? 
Maybe I am reading more into it then exists but the bullet in the document
says it will:
  Reduce help desk calls from end-users related to "untrusted"   certificates
That and the other language lead me to believe they have a trusted root
already loaded in my browser that they let anybody authenticate to that is
willing to buy their certificate authority software and that my browser will
think those certificates are fine. I just hope that none of the private keys
of all these (many probably unsecured) CAs leak.

@_subject: FYI: The size of a bit of entropy 
I find it interesting that we actually know the size of a bit ;-)
  Planck area, approximately 10^(-66) square centimeter,   is the fundamental quantum unit of area determined by   the strength of gravity, the speed of light and the   size of quanta...it is as if the entropy were written   on the event horizon, with each bit (each digital 1 or   0) corresponding to four Planck areas.
I read this as the entire AES256 lookup-table (plaintext/ciphertext pair
and matching 256 bit key) only takes about 2400 square kilometers
(assuming I did my arithmetic correctly). The Larsen B ice shelf lost
this much area between 1998 and 2000. Dang, we could have used that.

A new version of Transmeta's Crusoe TM5800 processor with
  the built-in security features will be available in the   second half of the year, said Walter Sun, a senior product   manager at Transmeta...The technology will enable users to
  store security-related information such as passwords and   keys to lock and unlock encrypted, or scrambled, messages   inside the processor, which serves as the brains of a   computer...The processor will also include a hardware   acceleration engine to speed up processing when strong   encryption technologies are used, such as Triple DES.

@_subject: Announcing httpsy://, a YURL scheme 
A YURL aware search engine may find multiple independent references to a
YURL, thus giving you parallel reporting channels, and increasing trust.
Of course, this method differs from the YURL method for trust. The
parallel channel method assigns a trust value to a site by querying the
YURL aware search engine.

Not a break at all. The physical limit for cloning is 5/6ths of the bits will clone true. Alice need only send 6 bits for every one bit desired to assure Eve has zero information. For a 256-bit key negotiation, Alice sends 1536 bits and hashes it down to 256 bits for the key.

@_subject: Firm invites experts to punch holes in ballot software 
Except to those of us who don't trust the system.
Implemented correctly it could be cheap and complications could be
hidden from the voter. It could be cheaper - no need to pay people to do
an audit when "the people" will do it for you. You only need a small
fraction of "the people" to verify their votes to get a high level of
confidence that the election is valid. You only need one failure to cast
doubt on the election. This requires an un-forgeable receipt that cannot
be used for coercion. Un-forgeable we have been doing for a while now
with lots of different PK options. A receipt that cannot be used for
coercion cannot give any indication to others of who you voted for.
Right now this is a big complication (at least to me - I don't know how
to create such a receipt that doesn't require mental gymnastics on the
part of the voter).

@_subject: FYI: 3 qubits encrypted 
Apparently, it is as hard (or harder) to produce random qubits as random
bits. There are some sentences in this article that don't make sense so
I am guessing the author doesn't really understand the subject.
  ...random operators would be useful for quantum   communications tasks like encryption, said Emerson.   "The idea is to randomize a specific configuration of   qubits containing the message, and then transmit this   randomized state," he said...The researchers tested the   method on a three-qubit prototype liquid nuclear   magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computer. -Michael Heyman
