@_subject: Utimacos Safeguard Easy broken by danish police in tax evation ca 
The german encryption program Safeguard Easy has been broken by the danish
police. Today the police from the city Holstebro in Jutland presented
evidence in court, that was provided after breaking the encryption on five
out of sixteen computers that where seized april 25 this year.
All 16 computers were protected with Safeguard Easy from the german
encryption provider Utimaco. It is not known whether DES, 128-bit IDEA,
Blowfish or Stealth was used as algorithm on the computers. All four
algorithms are built in Safeguard Easy. Details are sparse. It is not known
how the encryption was broken, whether it was brute forced or flaws in the
program was exploited.
The computers where seized from the humanitarian (leftwing) foundation Tvind
(Humana) in connection with a case about tax evation. Among the evidence
provided from the encrypted computers were emails sent among the leaders of
the foundation, Poul Jorgensen and Mogens Amdi Petersen describing transfers
of large sums of money.
Apparantly, but not confirmed, british Scotland Yard has been involved in
breaking the encryption. The danish police doesn't have the capacity to
break encryption by themselves. Neither has the danish civilian intelligence
service. Routine is that cases concerning encryption is handed over to the
danish defence intelligence service DDIS. This procedure has been described
earlier this year by the danish minister of justice in connection with
another case. DDIS denies involvement with the Tvind case.
Employees and leaders at Tvind has denied handing over their passwords to
the computers. One even wrote a public letter mocking the chief of police in
Holstebro, describing how he changed his password weekly, and stating that
he'd probably even forgotten his password by now. At a time, the police
concidered putting employees in custody until passwords were handed over.
Thats all for now

@_subject: Danish police: Not Safeguard Easy but passwords were weak 
Dear Declan, Politech, Cryptographylist.
It was reported in national media - including tv - that the police had
succesfully _broken_ the encryption. This, it seems, is not the case. The
police have managed to find the _passwords_ of the five encrypted computers.
The information concerning the succesful decryption of the five computers protected with Safeguard Easy was presented in court by chief prosecutor Poul Gade. Investigation is lead by chief of police in Holstebro, Jens Kaasgaard. I have just interviewed Jens Kaasgaard. He says: 'To avoid misunderstandings, we haven't _broken_ Safeguard by technically breaking down the encryption. We have located the passwords in different ways. We have done it like any hacker would have done, by trying to figure out the most probable passwords. This has payed success in five cases.' 'After doing that we entered the document-parts, the harddisk of the computer. Here we found some of the files unencrypted and other files further encrypted.' 'When you use Safeguard you put a sort of shell around your data. This is the first part you need to enter. This is what is claimed to be impossible. It _is_ impossible. We have had six private companies looking at this, and they have all failed.' 'We have used completely ordinary police investigation methods. We know precisely who have had access to the encrypted machines. Then we can start assessing probabilities and calculate upon this and set up models for how, if you were a hacker, you'd find your way into the machines. That's what we have done.' _You did this yourself?_ 'Yes. We did this inside the police system.' =09If the OS used was Windows, it's quite likely that the plaintext
and/or passphrases were recovered in the Windows swap file.  Barring OS
considerations, it's also possible that the police put a keystroke
on the system, just as the FBI here in the States did with an organized
crime suspect.=20
=09My gut sense is that, since only five of sixteen systems were
"cracked," it seems likely that it was the swap file that let the cat
of the bag.  Even so, a flaw in the cryptosystem should be investigated
and proven or ruled out.
=09Let us not also forget that people can be pressured to divulge
passphrases.  Rubber-hose cryptanalysis isn't just a humorous concept.

I'm curious as well about how the tap could actually happen though
some major bells and whistles taking place. If my understanding of fiber
correct, data flows at incredible rates through a line - but one
fracture and
suddenly you're going to have massive data loss and I can imagine that
at the
controlling house for that fiber line all manner of noise is going to
which would also (another guess) cause events to roll into place where a
team would be sent out ASAP to check on the fiber and fix it - in which
the people trying to install the tap would be caught red handed? I don't
the manual handy on how they manage trans oceanic fiber lines, and I
know there
are a few for redundancy so that they might not fly/swim out there
for repairs. It would also be incredibly fishy to any operator who saw a
go down and then come backup when both sides report that all physically
immediately inspectable connections are otherwise normal and good? Hate
to be
cliche in this thought but if this happened about the only way I can see
taking place (from the limited knowledge I have on this) would be if
there was
an NSA or other government agent standing over the operator as the alarm
off about the line failure and canceling it, then politely telling the
'This never happened, and I was never here' (a'la James Earl Jones in
Hunt for
Red October).
To sum this whole thing up - /IS/ there a way to put a tap on a fiber
without letting the whole world know you're doing it, if not just the
operator/owner of the line itself? And if so could someone sketch it out
me or point me to a resource? I'd love to learn of it
