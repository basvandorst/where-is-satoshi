@_subject: A Note About Trust Anchor Key Distribution 
nice paper.  note that it claims this paper is being published to establish IPR claims.  there is prior art in several vectors.
you may wish to consider the following (although now expired) Internet Drafts:
and a similar one authored by Mike StJohns.
that cover the same basic ideas. at least one of
these is being updated and revised.

The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is not trusted.

@_subject: [Cryptography] DNSSEC = completely unnecessary? 
you seem to presume if the channel is secure, the data is protected.
 DNSSEC protects the integrity of the data, regardless of the channel.
 SSL only protects the channel... and we see that only protecting the  channel is fraught with peril.

@_subject: [Cryptography] soft chewy center 
much of the discussion these past few weeks seems to be centered on channel and container protection, secure paths,  encrypted file systems, etc.  much effort has gone into ensureing
opaque environments for data to flow.   and while interesting and perhaps useful, not a whole lot of effort seems to targeting the integrity of the data itself. wrapping the soft chewy middle
with a hard candy shell can and does hide the fact that your core/data may be rotten.
some years back, i was part of a debate on the relative value of crypto - and it was pointed
out that for some sectors,  crypto ensured _failure_ simply because processing the bits introduced
latency.  for these sectors, speed was paramount.
think HFT or any sort of "Flash Mob" event where you want in/out as quickly as possible.  crypto in and of itself is not a generator of value. Sprinkeling Security/Crypto pixie dust
on -everything- can not be a good idea.   Just my 0.02 lira.   Jari and Stephen, please don't take the IETF there - its a wasteland.
