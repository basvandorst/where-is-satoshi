Not true (counterexample: ECMQV).
Because various standard forms of EC were never covered by patents.
This has been rehashed many times, for example:
Again, this is well covered.  The reason is the fundamental difference
in the performance of the best-known attacks (GNFS vs. Pollard's rho).
Also, EC public operations are typically faster than private, although
not on the order of the difference between RSA public and private ops.
The RSA or EC primitives are *not* usable cryptographic schemes by
themselves, thus it isn't fair to compare them this way (RSA+PKCS !=
EC point multiplication).
ECDSA, for example, is intentionally constrained to be signing-only and
the hash signed is a fixed size.  It's more fair to compare RSA+PKCS
with EC+DSA/DH.  In that sense, I think the complexity of implementation
is similar.
I'm not saying that one of these schemes is better than the other.  They
each have their own tradeoffs.  I just object to your methodology of
claiming RSA is fundamentally more problematic than EC.

I disagree.  I was referring to the *standard* case (no point
compression, no special performance tweaks).  If you're building
something high performance, choosing special curves, etc., you're in a
different playing field.  Whether it's possible to do an efficient
implementation in hw without resorting to those techniques is a very
specific question that I won't answer here.
I won't go into any more detail since it's not a good policy to publicly
discuss patents.  I just wanted to respond to the FUD that the original
poster was spreading re: EC being covered by patents that had expired.

I never understand these long threads about patents.  They always follow
the same course.  I address the following to the whole list, not just you.
Fact: Most patents get granted, even for things you might consider
trivial.  Instead of complaining about it, work for patent reform.  How
about an open review process where the public can submit prior art via
the web?  EU patents face a similar challenge period.  So go help make
this happen!
Fact: Most patents are never used, meaning no lawsuit is filed against
someone based on infringement.  Most are kept in reserve in case the
company is sued for their product infringing something else or for
negotiating leverage in business deals.
Given these two things, it makes little sense to whine about a single
patent on an obscure mailing list.  Instead, go do something about the
process as a whole.

I wrote a series of articles on the problem of not verifying padding
with small-exponent RSA.  In the conclusion, it listed a number of
well-known attacks against other public key systems, including small
subgroup confinement.
The author of the Mu article does not list all the verification steps
needed, and even seems to infer that the values g and p are negotiated
between the two parties.  This would be a bad idea, versus choosing a
set of values that were pre-verified.
This type of attack was even discussed in the realm of IPSEC back in 1997:
All this attack allows is for one side of a DH exchange to intentionally
downgrade the security, but there's no reason one of them couldn't just
publish the "secure" derived value AFTER completing the entire exchange.
 Or, publish their secret exponent.
If this is not authenticated DH, then you have other problems.

Thunderbird, at least, downloads imap mail locally for searching.  So all I need is the automatic public key encryption on the server side (no searching).  Is there such an application already?

While mixing in more entropy is a good idea in general, I'd like to caution against just throwing things in without knowing the full design end-to-end.  For example, if the environment is an embedded device and hash() introduces visible power or timing side channels, you may not want to do this exact construction.  Most of the time it is fine, though.
DSA is especially vulnerable to all kinds of subtleties with k.  As you point out, it is fatal to replay k for a given private key x.  But even worse, it is fatal if some small number of bits of k are *predictable*.   This means even if the output wasn't completely predictable, but had merely become somewhat predictable, it would still be exploitable.
Mark Marson at Cryptography Research has done some great work implementing these attacks.  They're quite practical.  I hope he'll give a public talk about it some day.
This assumes the message always changes.  Isn't this just getting back to padding schemes, where you build something like PSS under your DSA to protect against signing identical messages?
Since it appears some OpenSSL people are on this list, I'd like to ask for more openness in the PRNG design and seeding.  The current code is crufty and arbitrary.  Some minor but careful additions could have helped reveal this bug earlier.
The code should generate warnings in the case of PURIFY being defined. A comment should explain the security relevance of the seeding.  For  PURIFY
     /* SECURITY: add entropy to our pool.  This is essential. (more) */
     seed_PRNG(buf);
      PRNG seeding disabled for Purify, do NOT use PRNG output!
     printf("WARNING: PRNG seeding disabled for Purify, do NOT use PRNG Also, there should be a TEST_MODE_INSECURE flag that outputs a debug print of each time the PRNG is seeded and the data itself.  This should be run on a regular basis as part of automated tests.  For example:
 TEST_MODE_INSECURE
 PRNG seeding debug prints enabled, do NOT use PRNG output!
printf("WARNING: PRNG seeding debug prints enabled, do NOT use PRNG seed_PRNG(src_name, buf)
 TEST_MODE_INSECURE
printf("PRNG seeding from %s: %s\n", src_name, hex_dump(buf));
     ... do seeding ...
Anyway, I hope this incident helps us all add more openness and paranoia to our designs.
