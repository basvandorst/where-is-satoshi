@_subject: Decimal encryption 
Actually, block ciphers encrypting blocks of *decimal* numbers exist:
- TOY100 [1] encrypts blocks of 32 decimal digits
- DEAN18 [2] encrypts blocks of 18 decimal digits
- DEAN27 [3] encrypts blocks of 27 decimal digits
TOY100 is (almost) broken by the generalized linear cryptanalysis  described in [2]. Both versions of DEAN are based on a substitution  permutation network very close to that of the AES and are provably  secure against linear cryptanalysis. These ciphers are only "toy"  ciphers. Consequently, there is no official implementation (no test- vector, etc.).

I hope this helps. I'm of course available for any question regarding  Best regards,
