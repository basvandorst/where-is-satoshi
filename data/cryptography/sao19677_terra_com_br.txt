@_subject: secure hash modes for rijndael 
Why not using tandem or abreast Davies-Meyer, as
it is done with IDEA? These modes are designed for
block ciphers whose key length is twice the block
length -- certainly the case for AES-256 -- and
generate hashes with twice the block length.
I'm resisting the temptation to say that they were
also more thoroughly analyzed (this should be the
case because they are long known by now, but I'm not
aware of any such analysis).
I have asked NIST's Jim Foti about this issue some
time ago. Maybe it's a good idea to submit a public
comment for NIST's modes of operation process, just
in case...
