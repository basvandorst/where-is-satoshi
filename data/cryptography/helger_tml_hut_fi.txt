@_subject: blocking chinese domains? 
May be this is also the reason why some smart people in China have started
to mirror interesting-to-them but sensible-in-content sites? My own
collection of cryptographic pointers,
 has been mirrored a while as
 - and I know it is not
the only popular site; they have e.g. mirrored the cryptographic part of
the Counterpane webpage. Although I am not sure this has been done since
they wouldn't be able to access the sites otherwise... My original pages
have received some hits from China during THIS weekend.

@_subject: Sender and receiver non-repudiation 
Answering only to this concrete question: the kind of things you want are
accomplished by contract signing protocols. A few recent papers:
Optimistic Protocols for Fair Exchange(N. Asokan, Matthis Schunter,
Michael Waidner, 1996)
Optimal Efficiency of Optimistic Contract Signing(Birgit Pfitzmann,
Matthias Schunter, Michael Waidner, PODC 98)
Optimistic synchronous multi-party contract signing(N. Asokan, Birgit
Baum-Waidner, Matthias Schunter, and Michael Waidner, dec 1998)
Asynchronous protocols for optimistic fair exchange(N. Asokan, Victor
Shoup, Michael Waidner, may 1998)
Optimistic asynchronous multi-party contract signing(Birgit Baum-Waidner
and Michael Waidner, nov 1998)
Optimistic fair exchange of digital signatures(N. Askon, Victor Shoup,
Michael Waidner, oct 1999)
Abuse-free Optimistic Contract Signing(Juan Garay, Markus Jakobsson, Phil
MacKenzie, CRYPTO '99)
Abuse-free Multi-party Contract Signing( Juan Garay, Phil MacKenzie, DISC
Provable Secure Certified Mail(Birgit Pfitzmann, Matthias Schunter,
Michael Waidner, 2000)

Answering more generally: it does not help you to get non-repudiation.
Nothing does, unless Bob is able to prove that you signed this document
consiously, being sober, and generally, that you MEANT to sign it.

@_subject: I'm looking for FSE2001 proceedings 
I am one of the authors of one of the papers there. As far as I know, only
preproceedings are available until now - the deadline to send the final
version to Matsui was at the end of May. It is no wonder it takes time to
publish the final proceedings. On the other hand, preproceedings were (I
think) printed in a small quantity and mostly for the conference
participants. You may still inquery Matsumoto Matsui about their
availability, but doubt in it. Moreover, preproceedings *really* contained
*prefinal* versions of the papers.
If you want to get final versions, contact the authors. It is also mostly
up to them to put their papers on their homepages - some authors do, some
don't: mind that not all of them have time or possibilities to maintain a

@_subject: septillion operations per second 
this is of course, science fiction. (remember Planck constant, speed of
light, etc.)
2^128/10^24=340282366920938.4634633746077 (seconds), so even assuming such
a computer would do 10^24 key searches per second (as opposes to 10^24
'instructions'), it would still take ten million years for one computer.

@_subject: Zero Knowledge Identity Proofs 
THe proofs that you are requesting for have been standard tools in
cryptography for many years - they are usually known as identification
schemes. The best known scheme (and most elegant IMHO) is the Schnorr
identification scheme. See
for a (noncomplete) collection of links.
