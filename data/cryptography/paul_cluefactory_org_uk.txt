@_subject: Outreach Volunteers Needed - Content Control is a Dead End 
A tempting but false proposition, on two grounds.
First, privacy is the protection of information where all those who
have it are cooperating in its protection.  Copy control enforcement
is a much harder challenge because it is intended to prevent some who
have the information from dispersing it further.  I can send you a
message encrypted with PGP; this delivers privacy, but does not stop
you broadcasting the message to the world if you so choose.
And secondly, it matters not a whit what you personally embrace or do
not embrace.  Whether effective copy control enforcement is possible
is not a matter of preference but of fact.  I can't resist quoting
Bruce Schneier's excellent paragraph in the recent Crypto Gram making
this point:
    Every time I write about the impossibility of effectively
    protecting digital files on a general-purpose computer, I get
    responses from people decrying the death of copyright. "How will
    authors and artists get paid for their work?" they ask me. Truth
    be told, I don't know. I feel rather like the physicist who just
    explained relativity to a group of would-be interstellar
    travelers, only to be asked: "How do you expect us to get to the
    stars, then?"  I'm sorry, but I don't know that, either.

Two of the papers are on my web pages: Scott Fluhrer's on breaking my
cipher Mercy, and Stefan Lucks and mine on breaking Leviathan:

@_subject: Starium (was Re: article: german secure phone) 
This is only secure if all parties are forced to commit to the DH
information they're going to send before they send it.  Otherwise,
it's trivial to collect g^x_1, g^y_2 from the two parties, then
generate y_1, x_2 s.t. the resulting g^{x_1 y_1}, g^{x_2 y_2} collide
in the last four digits by trying about a hundred candidates for each
in a birthday attack.

@_subject: NYC events and cell phones 
A normal PC with several hundred gigabytes of disk space and two weeks
preprocessing is sufficient to break A5/1 in about two minutes.  Some
known plaintext is needed; I don't know whether anyone's measured how
difficult it is to make guesses at knownn plaintext in a cellphone
voice stream.

Those choosing data formats for crypto purposes might want to consider
the simple and elegant format S-expression used by SPKI, described
[Moderator's note: I'm a big fan of that format. --Perry]

The "cache" link on that page carries it:
I confess I love SPKI, and I would love to know why we're not in a
sitation where it's in widespread use today.
