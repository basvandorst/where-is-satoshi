This should probably refer to the private exponent. Weiner's
continued fraction attack (from
recovers the private exponent if it's known to be less than
a quarter the length of the modulus (if the factors of the
modulus are approximately the same size and other reasonable
conditions are met).
More recently, Dan Boneh and Glenn Durfee described a lattice
attack: to prevent this, the length of the private exponent must be at least (1 - sqrt(2)) times the length of the modulus.
Nick Howgrave-Graham gave some arguments at CaLC 2001 as to why
this attack probably isn't going to get any better.
There's a really good survey of attacks on the RSA cryptosystem
at which should help too.

But you don't have to contact the CA to get someone's certificate.
A standard way is to send them an email saying "can you send me
a signed message?"
This also ensures you have the right public key. I haven't
studied the details of IBE, but I assume that (a) there may
be multiple IBE-based "CA"s, with different parameters, and
(b) the identity that's used to encrypt will be not just a name, but a name and a date (to ensure that some revocation-like
capability exists). In either case, you can't simply pick the
email address and use it as the public key; you need to establish
some additional information first. This seems to put us back in the same place as with standard PKI, usability-wise. (Or,

Maybe so, but if you don't have integrity checking,
so that an attacker can inject packets into the stream,
this can often compromise privacy too. For example,

@_subject: New NTRUEncrypt Parameters 
(I've also posted this message to sci.crypt)
Hi list,
NTRU Cryptosystems has posted several new documents, which are
avaible through As background: recent results on NTRUEncrypt have shown that
decryption failures on validly encrypted messages leak information
that eventually allows an attacker to recover the private key.
The results do not affect the known difficulty of the underlying
class of lattice problems; however, they show that care must
be taken in choosing parameters to ensure that decryption failures
occur with negligible or zero probability, even in the presence
of an adversary who is actively trying to cause such failures.
NTRU Cryptosystems is proposing slightly altered parameter sets
which decrease the probability of average-case decryption failures, and a padding scheme which ensures that an attacker cannot increase
the probability of decryption failures above this average-case
The new documents analyze the strength of the new parameter sets
against all known attacks on NTRU (lattice-based, meet-in-the-
middle, and decryption failure based) and show that for N=251
we comfortably achieve 2^80 security against all of these attacks.
We also provide the first ever full proof of security to be presented
for NTRUEncrypt.
If anyone has any questions, I'll be happy to answer them.

@_subject: How thorough are the hash breaks, anyway? 
My understanding is that once you've used trial division to
get rid of all the extremely short divisors, a random number of length n is about as hard to factor as an RSA modulus of
the same length. I don't think there are a lot of easy-to-factor moduli around.

To be more precise: Your odds of getting a modulus that
you can divide by something are very high. Your odds of
getting a modulus that you can factor efficiently are very low.

I'm not sure what you're trying to demonstrate here. From
the fact that NSA chose to license a few curves, we can definitely deduce that they want to use those curves. You
deduce from the fact that they didn't license other curves
that there is no patent on those curves, but you could equally well deduce that the curves they did license are
good enough and they don't need to pay extra money to
license on the other curves.

Quantum computers break RSA, cryptosystems based on discrete log over finite fields, and cryptosystems based on discrete log over
elliptic curves, where "break" means "reduce to polynomial time".
The best description of the ECC variant of Shor's quantum algorithm
is in Proos and Zalka's "Shor's discrete logarithm quantum algorithm
for elliptic curves",  They
estimate that ~1000 qubits are needed to break a 160-bit ECC key
(as opposed to ~2000 qubits for a 1024-bit RSA key).
NTRU and HFE-based schemes (such as QUARTZ and SFLASH) aren't currently known to be broken by quantum algorithms -- there are proposed quantum
algorithms that may square-root the time to break NTRU, but this isn't
a reduction to polynomial time. I don't know if anyone's looked at
quantum computers as applied to HFE.

standard specifications for public-key cryptography for use
by electrical and electronics engineers. Std 1363-2000 is
due for revision this year, which will involve merging
Std 1363a with the base Std 1363. As part of this revision and merger process the working group will be considering submissions for additions and amendments to the existing documents. These submissions can include anything from notifications of new security results to requests that
techniques in the standard be added, modified or deleted.
This mail is a pre-call for submissions for the revised
document. An official call for submissions will follow in
the new year. We anticipate that the submissions period will
last till approximately July 31st, 2006, so we can start
discussing submissions at the working group meeting that
traditionally follows Crypto.

There are existing quantum encryption algorithms that require a
physical link between the communicators (and don't provide
authentication) -- these are used in the products sold by ID Quantique. But it hasn't been established that an encryption
algorithm needs to be based on quantum mechanisms to survive
the introduction of quantum computers. So I'd take issue with
your phrasing of the question.
In so far as you're wondering about what algorithms will be
used in the post-quantum computing world, the ECRYPT project has organized a workshop on postquantum cryptography -- see  for details. The report of that
workshop should be interesting reading.

@_subject: Why the exponent 3 error happened: 
I think this is a bit unfair.
PKCS signatures were originally designed to include a hash identifier to address a specific concern, arising from the
fact that RSA signers can freely choose the hash algorithm
to use.
Say that Alice uses SHA-1 to generate her signature on m,
and SHA-1(m) = h.
Then the concern is that Bob can find a broken hash function
BASH such that BASH(m') = h. If he can do that and format a
message that claims to be signed with RSA and BASH, then he
can present Alice's signature as a valid signature on m'.
There are a number of different protections against this.
For example, Alice's cert could identify her key as only to be used with SHA-1 (this is effectively what happens with
DSA public keys). However, the convention has been to mark an
RSA key in an X.509 cert as rsaEncryption and not specify
in the AlgorithmIdentifier that it's only to be used with a
certain hash function (or signature scheme).
So PKCS incorporated the hash identifier, which prevents
a signature generated with one hash algorithm from being
used with a different hash algorithm. (Since then, Burt
Kaliski's done some research on the use of hash "firewalls"
of this type: see
His conclusion is that by and large they aren't necessary,
but that isn't relevant to the discussion here).
At the time, ASN.1 was in widespread use, so it was an obvious decision (rather than pointless stupidity) to use it to encode the hash function identifier. In practice, the ASN.1 doesn't introduce complexity because most implementations (certainly ones I've worked on) simply treated it as a memcmp rather than wheeling out the heavy ASN.1 machinery.
The real problem isn't ASN.1; the problem is that an
encoding method was used for the rest of the signature
that didn't specify the length of the signature block
and it didn't occur to anyone to check it.

@_date: 2006-09-16 18:43:10
@_author: Whyte, William 
@_subject: Why the exponent 3 error happened: 
No. It's not the ASN.1 that says it's extraneous, it's the
PKCS standard. The problem is that the PKCS standard
didn't require that the implementation check for the
correct number of ff bytes that precede the BER-encoded
hash. The attack would still be possible if the hash
wasn't preceded by the BER-encoded header.

Again, not quite right. You have to do a memcmp() and

@_date: 2006-09-17 15:36:12
@_author: Whyte, William 
@_subject: A note on vendor reaction speed to the e=3 problem 
It's correct that the attack doesn't apply if you expect
the hash to be in a fixed byte position. I would say that
it's incorrect that there was no chance of it being screwed up in the absence of ASN.1. But I'm happy to agree to
disagree at this point.

I'd extend it to "don't use e <= 17". The PKCS attack will work with
e = 17, SHA-512 and RSA-15360, and someone's bound to implement RSA-15360
somewhere to claim 256-bit security.
