I would have to argue that a single bit could indeed constitute
enough of a difference to represent a security vulnerability.
There have been a number of security issues that have occured due
to an underlying integer wrap vulnerability; what if the single bit
that was changed was the MSB of a length field in an often unused
code path, that when properly manipulated, resulted in a controllable
heap ovewrite?
The difference would be subtle, only a single bit, which fits
with the attack.  Exploitable examples, where by flipping the
MSB is enough to allow an attack, are known in the computer
security field.  One doesn't need to include the entire back
door to cause a problem.
