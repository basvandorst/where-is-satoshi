@_subject: septillion operations per second 
In James Bamford's new book 'Body of Secrets' he claims the NSA is working on some FAST computers. The secret community is also home to the largest collection of hyper-powerful computers, advanced mathematicians and skilled language experts on the planet.
Within the city, time is measured in femtosecondsone million billionth of a second, and scientists work in secret to develop computers capable of performing more than one septillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) operations every second.
If they ever build such a computer (or 1.000.000 of them) what would that mean for today's key lengths ?
I am curious how long a computer capable of a septillion operations per second would take to crack one 128 bit or 256 bit key.
Or a RSA 1024 or 2048 bit key for that matter ...

I went to Sieuwert's thesis today, and it was interesting.
