WinPT, Windows Privacy Tray. Pretty much identical with PGPtray (except no
email plugins yet), but free in every sense.

Were the email plugins included in the source distribution for the previous
PGP versions? If so, you should be able to rewrite them for WinPT.

Just to point out that any newspaper which is only published online can be
changed easily. The fact people can save copies isn't that relevant, since
they could easily have faked them. Same with screenshots etc. DRM is
something of a red herring here. :-)

True. But, if there's a difference between the two, why should I believe
something you've got rather than something that's on their server?
They often archive online papers?

A good point. But then lots of people still believe the Good Times virus
will fry their CPU, so just having it in lots of places doesn't mean it's
true. :-)
In general I agree with the original poster, I'm just trying to make the
point that online sources are already unreliable in this way.

@_subject: A Trial Balloon to Ban Email?  
Mostly unrelated to this, but something's just occurred to me. Probably I'm
being really stupid, but ... for the receiving MTA to know that the problem
has been processed properly, it would have to know the answer. How does it
know what the answer should be?

Without wishing to belittle the authors (EROS is definitely impressive; I'm
not familiar with the others), I suspect one reason that they don't have
many problems is because very few people use them. If they started to become
more widely used, I wonder how long before compromises would creep in.

@_subject: A quick question... 
Apologies in advance for the vagueness of the question...
Talking to a friend the other day, he was telling me about a potential
loophole with SHA-1 hashes protected by an RSA signature. Basically, he
seemed to think that with an SHA hash of a suitable length (say, 2^20), the
hash could be cubed and still not 'fail', since it was below the key
modulus. If you change the hash length, this problem doesn't occur.
I'm unconvinced for a number of reasons - this sounds very strange to me.
Not least because, even if cubing the hash does work (why cubing?), since
it's infeasible to create a binary which produces a given hash it still
doesn't help. Could someone help shed some light on this? Either pointing me at a paper
documenting the hole, or confirming that it's gibberish (at which point I'll
go back to work and ask him for more details :).

@_subject: A quick question... 
The code which implements all of this has to run in <6KB of code space, so
it's entirely possible that they hacked together their own routines to deal
with it. Almost certain, in fact - I don't think there's a compiler
available, so any library would have to be rewritten in assembler anyway.
(Sorry I can't be more precise here, but I'm sure you can appreciate why.)
[snip explanation]
It certainly makes much more sense than the scrambled version I had before,
and fits with what cryptography I already knew. I still don't think it's a
particularly *practical* attack, but I could easily be wrong there, and it
only needs one. ;-)
Many thanks for your time!

@_subject: debunking snake oil 
I didn't realise the current SecurID tokens had been broken. A quick Google
doesn't show anything, but I'm probably using the wrong terms. Do you have
references for this that I could have a look at?
