@_subject: Can we copy trust? 
[Moderator's note: Please do not top post. --Perry]
I am thinking that trust is a relationship.  "A trusts B".  So if you  start with "A trusts B" and you do some operation that results in "C  trusts B" then you have not copied anything because "A trusts B" is  not equal to "C trusts B".  You can't call that operation a "copy".   I can't think of any scenario where it even makes sense to talk about  copying trust.  The closest thing I can think of would be a document,  or record in a database, or a certificate, or similar thing that  reminds me that "I trust X".  That is consistent with Bill Frantz's  comment on memory.  (hi Bill)  I can copy the reminder, but that  doesn't copy the trust.  The trust exists, it seems to me, with or  without the reminder (even if I have temporarily forgotten about it).
Kind regards,

@_subject: CSPRNG algorithms 
This paper describes the architecture of a prototype I built at Sun  back in 1995 for a random number generating service that ran in user  land.  It went through a couple revisions, and eventually got ported  to the kernel in Solaris 10.
The revisions since the paper were fairly minor: using a bigger  entropy pool, improving the entropy estimation algorithm, and  tweaking the bleed function.  I am not sure what changes were made  when it was ported to the kernel as I was not directly involved.   Unfortunately, the details of the revisions are only documented in  the source code.
Kind regards,
