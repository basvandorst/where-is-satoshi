NSPW is a unique workshop that is devoted to the critical examination of new paradigms in security. Each year, since 1992, we examine proposals for new principles upon which information security can be rebuilt from the ground up. We conduct extensive, highly interactive discussions of these proposals, from which we hope both the audience and the authors emerge with a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of what has been discussed.
