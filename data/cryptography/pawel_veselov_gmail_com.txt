Just wondering, why wouldn't GPS trackers use 2G to determine the  And, also, does it even need a cell service subscription for location  determination, or is it enough to query the cell towers (through some  handshake protocols) to figure out the proximities and coordinates?

It's a very thorough paper. IMHO, though, if somebody were to get their
hands on a database like this, they will know immediately what's going on,
and won't go poking around until they steal the "honeword" database first.
With having a moderate amount of properly disguised fake accounts, it's
harder to see a trap coming. Though, once it's known that company X is
using fake accounts, the strategies against that company's stolen passwords
would change.

Yes. Wikipedia article
also has a reasonable explanation on how they work. There is also an RFC
that plops SRP on top of TLS.
But, with ssh, or protocols like ssh, session is established per TCP
connection. You wouldn't ask the user the password every time an HTTP(s)
connection is established.
There certainly are for the web. Not so much for HTTP(s) though. You can't
reasonably (from the UE perspective) implement SRP/ZKP for HTTP because
it needs to span multiple HTTP requests. The full SRP web solutions do
javascript (or other) code to retrieve any protected data (there are
that only check the password, after which it's standard HTTP session)
If the X509 certificate checks out that just means nobody stole the private
key of the holder, or a CA you trust. If the SRP checks out, that means
that the
server has the verifier code derived from your password. So in case of
the password database breach, it would be very hard to derive your password,
but still as easy to impersonate the server. Though they won't get your
even if you give it to the impersonator.
If you don't use PKI, then you'd have problems trusting whom to establish
the passwords with in the first place.
Your client must terminate the connection if the server's proof doesn't
check out, or if it can't decrypt the data from the server.
Yes, neither fake servers no MITM can get into your data unless they have
the verifier.
SRP really helps in:
- preventing password from ever being transmitted
- preventing guessing the password even if the password is really simple
Besides it's ability to encrypt communications, it in no way deprecates any
of the
functionality of the PKI.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Graphs for asymmetric crypto? 
Umm, here is what I'm looking it. I came across patent 8,411,854 (
The suggestion there is to take the hash of the password+salt, and turn it
into permutation function that serves as a "private key". I believe the way
the function is built (I don't know how those things are called, but it
involves turning the hash into factorial polynomial, and using the
coefficient for the mapping table, then enforcing the mapping table doesn't
repeat indexes by shifting away the duplicates). The graphs (though I don't
understand what "kind") are randomly generated.
The whole patent is around ZKP. But I'm trying to understand its value
over, say, SRP6a. I really don't know whether this mechanism is better than
using RSA (or ECC, though SRP6a on its face needs to be modified to support
But there are other statements in the patent that I find a bit off:
Graph isomorphism provides an NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial time) space
I think that's really lack of adoption, not expense of the computation.
The graph isomorphism does not require usersâ browsers to find co-prime
multiplicative inverses is for ECC, right? I don't get the co-prime
numbers, are they talking about dh-params? Those aren't needed to be
computed, afaik.
Typically, ZKP challenge-response protocols arc based on:
I also don't get that statement, unless they are comparing ZKP to X.509
auth, which is not fair.

Posted on Reddit here, with plenty of comments;
I just reported this project to Kickstarter and encourage all to do the
same. KS does suspend hot air projects.
