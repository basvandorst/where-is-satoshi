sybil attacks.
Kind of; the longest blockchain isn't important - the blockchain with the
most cumulative proof of work is considered the correct chain. FYI, the "c"
in "Bitcoin" is never capitalized.
Sure; let's say for the sake of argument that I decide to run 10,000
OpenPGP KeyServers and sybil attack your network. It sounds like I'd be
able to falsify data with a high rate of success. The numbers you choose
are likely irrelevant; I suspect that any such system would inevitably turn
into a form of "proof of work" as described by Paul Sztorc:
take a million dollars and buy a day's worth of hashing power - most of the
existing hashpower isn't for sale. To purchase enough new hashing power to
own 50% of the Bitcoin network (1,487,398 TH/S) would cost
approximately 114,415
Antminer S9 (13 TH/S) units at $2,500, or *$286m** in hardware costs *and 1.4
KW * 114,415 * $0.08 KW/H, or *$12,815** an hour in electricity costs*.
Except for the small fact that there aren't that many S9 units available
for purchase either...
It's unclear if you're talking about a permissionless network where anyone
can run a validator or a permissioned network with a predetermined trusted
federation of validators. If it's the latter then we're talking about a
completely different security model than Bitcoin.

invested tens to hundreds of millions of dollars into their infrastructure
and are making a long term speculative play - they aren't going to throw it
all away for a relative pittance.

I'm unfamiliar with GuardTime, but from skimming their web site it appears
that they are using blockchain tech on the back end to power their service.
Your point basically boils down to "what is the value in using a public
blockchain as opposed to a private blockchain that may be easier and
cheaper to use." There is no clear objective answer to this because it
essentially boils down to trust and security models. If a private
blockchain is good enough for your needs then by all means, use it!

You start believing their FUD videos about second layer networks creating

@_subject: [Cryptography] What is total world transaction volume? 
debit card transactions per year. But the real question is how many /cash/
transactions occur? I suspect (globally) it is probably far higher than
electronic transactions.
Given that blockchain-based cryptocurrencies require every validator node
to process the entirety of the network's transaction history, in order to
scale them up to reach mainstream level volumes, more complex layers of
transaction processing need to be built on top of the base layer in order
to achieve sufficient scalability.

@_subject: [Cryptography] One Bitcoin Transaction Now Uses as Much Energy 
I don't think it's a useful abstraction, but rather a distraction.
Transactions don't "use" mining energy - this is a skewed perspective of
how Bitcoin's thermodynamic security operates.
If you really want to approach this from a "per transaction" standpoint
then it's only fair to realize that with payment channel tech, orders of
magnitude more transactions can be occurring that are not measurable on the
blockchain. I expect that as payment channel tech proliferates, the "per
transaction" energy usage will drop significantly... but we won't be able
to calculate it.
You could even take a more naive view with current centralized custodial
providers and realize that they perform a huge number of "off chain"
transactions each day between their own customers by simply updating their
internal databases.
In short, this skewed "per transaction energy use" perspective is used in
order to make Bitcoin sound incredibly wasteful. You can massage the
numbers to make it seem wasteful or not, but the reality is that the
Bitcoin ecosystem has decided that it is willing to pay this cost in order
to secure itself against computational attack.
We hear this claim a lot, yet I've yet to see a credible analysis of what
the infrastructure running traditional digital payment records actually
costs to operate.

that other entities on the network agree with me about what 'correct'
actually means" - there is no solution to that on a public permissionless
network because anyone can run whatever code they want. The machine
consensus rests upon a foundation of human consensus which is not a written
specification, and I'd argue that trying to write such a written
specification is an exercise in futility. This is the basis of my claim
that no one can fully understand
 the system
we call Bitcoin. This underlying consensus is emergent in nature.
