Hello Jerry,
NSS seems to be still unbroken :-)
For crypto we still have mostly Old Faithful ?, don't we?
But yes, I think that, having a dozen megabytes of source code, nobody can
find such bugs.

OpenSSL memory management also allows to debug memory leaks. And it seem to
be an advantage of its memory-managing functions.

@_subject: [Cryptography] The Trouble with Certificate Transparency 
Hello Greg,
I'm sorry, I did not understand the idea of providing different trees and
proofs to different parties.
If I understand correctly, it should be prevented by Auditors and the
gossip protocol (yes, I understand it is not specified in fact). Auditors
and gossip protocol are designed for solving precisely this case.
The other possibility is that the Merkle tree is not neither append-only
nor verifiable.
We should have an perfect MITM that can intercept all the communications by
the victim and her/his software to turn this scenario into real life.
And, BTW, if we ask for more than one SCT in the cert as Ben does, the
attack becomes much more difficult even for the perfect MITM.
Thank you!

Hi all,
I try to respond. I'm one of persons who provided the implementation of
GOST to openssl in ssl.
No. The TLS will not be banned. It will not be regarded as good-enough
protection for communuications with goverment-related resources.
So in fact the implementors use current specification and use GOST
algorithms for PRF, cipher, MAC and auth. Most all are used according to
specifications, though sometimes there are some specific changes which are
to be hard-coded.
In most cases the IANA registry is a solution good enough for solving this

@_subject: [Cryptography] Key meshing (Re: [Crypto-practicum] Retire all 
Hello all,
Regarding the discussion of the Sweet32 attack, it's worth mentioning that
there is a specification of so called key meshing for the Russian GOST
cipher (which has 64-bit block as well).
Key meshing is a procedure of a predictable change of the current key after
processing an certain amount of data.
It is described in RFC 4357, Section 2.3 (
This key meshing defends against any attack that uses a big portion of data
encrypted with the same key.
May be it is useful to specify the similar procedure for modern ciphers too.

Dear Jerry,
I think, the designers were just paranoid ones :-). They were paranoid
enough to specify 256-bit key in 1989, so the key meshing does not seem to
be something extra in this case.
Also there are some problems with DTLS. We are currently working on solving
There can be a lot of rekeying algorithms, but the idea of using any of
them seems to be present only in academic papers.

Dear Donald,
They are NOT deprecated (at least, some of them). For example, in Russia
we have 4 algorithms of a digital signature, 2 of them are definitely

@_subject: [Cryptography] Formal definition of lightweight crypto 
Hello all,
Happy New Year!
Is there a formal definition of lightweight cryptographic algorithms?
The SPECK and SIMON algorithms by NSA (and many others) are declared to be
lightweight, but I did not find any definitions except
"These lightweight cryptographic primitives are designed to be efficient,
yet secure, when limited hardware resources are available. Consequently,
the main motive for current efforts of constructing lightweight
cryptographic primitives is to maintain a reasonable trade-off between
security, efficient hardware performance and low overall cost, measured by
a number of metrics. These metrics include, but are not limited to: area
(in terms of gate equivalences), throughput, power/energy consumption and
production cost."
Thank you!

@_subject: [Cryptography] What is "chameleon hash"? 
There is a very useful bitcoin-related article "The Blockchain Immutability
Myth" by Gedeon Greenspan
"With this in mind, let’s talk about the second case in which the doctrine
of blockchain immutability has been used to ridicule ideas. Here, we’re
referring to Accenture’s idea of using a chameleon hash  (
to enable a block buried deep in a chain to be easily replaced. The primary
motivation, as described by David Treat (
, is to allow an old problematic transaction to be quickly and efficiently
removed. Under the scheme, if a block substitution does occur, a “scar” is
left behind which all participants can see. (It should be noted that any
later transactions that depend on the deleted one would need to be removed
as well.)"
Does anybody know if there is an implementation or at least description of
"chameleon hash" and protocols based on them?
Thank you!

Dear All,
JFYI. Via Feisti Duck nerwsletter.
The eTLS key exchange shall use exactly the same messages and procedures to
establish a set of session keys as a
TLS 1.3 ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange, except for two differences
1) the server shall use a static public/private key pair at Step 2 in
clause 4.3.1; and
2) the server's certificate at Step 5 shall contain visibility information
as defined in clause 4.3.3 to indicate to the
client that eTLS is in use.
NOTE: Neither the static public key nor the visibility information affects
the operation of a TLS 1.3 compliant
client, so an eTLS server is therefore fully interoperable with TLS 1.3
compliant clients.

@_subject: [Cryptography] How widely are the PSK modes used? 
Dear Jon,
I suppose there are some places where PSK is necessary though
bootstrapping it is still hard. For example, a lack of randomness for the
normal TLS in IoT solutions can be such a place.
The other place I keep in mind is TLS 1.3, where the PSK mode, if I
understand it correctly, is a part of session resumption and, if it is not
available, we have to do the full handshake.
The real question is: if we make a PSK-less TLS profile, what problems do
we get? What areas will suffer from such a limitation?
Thank you!
