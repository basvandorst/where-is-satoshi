@_subject: "Approximate" hashes 
Computes nilsimsa codes of messages and compares the codes and finds
clusters of similar messages so as to trash spam.
What's a nilsimsa code?
A nilsimsa code is something like a hash, but unlike hashes, a small change
in the message results in a small change in the nilsimsa code.
