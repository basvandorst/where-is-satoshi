@_subject: Beware of /dev/random on Mac OS X 
+ Tim Dierks :
That is an interesting discussion that I don't feel qualified to
participate in (but look forward to following), but I think it's a
good idea to keep that issue separate from the one raised by Peter:
seen as needed, whereas /dev/random, by design, is for the very most
"paranoid".  Apple should not have violated the specification of
unable or unwilling to provide a true /dev/random, is to not provide
the device at all, and just settle for /dev/urandom.

@_subject: Find me a hash 
Susan Landau has an article in the upcoming March issue of Notices of
the AMS: "Find me a hash."
There is a short preview of the article here:
  it even includes a "non-public" (whatever that means) link to the
paper itself:
  Readers of the cryptography list may not learn anything new from it,
but it seems like a nice summary of the present state of affairs.
The article opens by calling hash function the duct tape of
cryptography, and ends with these words:
  What is the theory of hash functions? It is not often that
  mathematicians are asked to develop a theory for duct tape, but
  there is a clear and present need to do so now for cryptographic
  hash functions.

@_subject: What is a proof? 
+ "James A. Donald" :
As a mathematician with a somewhat limited knowledge of cryptography
(and hence mostly a lurker on this list), I feel strangely compelled
to respond.
First, I like your metaphor.  If I might build further on it, it would
be to point out that the first person to explore unknown terrain often
finds the journey ardous and difficult: He ends up scaling vertical
cliffs and crossing raging rivers, only later to discover that there
was an easier path.  Should he not then record the easier path, rather
than the difficult one that he himself followed initially?
Agreed.  But sometimes what may seem like jargon made to impress is
more analogous to a road, or maybe an all-terrain vehicle, that makes
the wilderness available with less effort (and incidentally makes it
less wild, but maybe this is where we should leave the metaphor
behind).  There is nothing wrong with jargon and big theories if they
fill a real need other than inflating the ego of their originators or
scaring away outsiders.

@_subject: Kaminsky finds DNS exploit 
+ John Kemp :
Unless he is merely blowing smoke, it would seem that he discovered
some little twist that makes the known vulnerability much more easily
exploitable than previously assumed. That would explain his statement:
the patch fixes a well known vulnerability, and as a side effect stops
the more serious attack, in effect making it hard to tell what is
involved in that attack from reading the patch.

@_subject: Trusted timestamping 
+ Fearghas McKay :
As explained at  they
moved to alt.security.pgp in 2002. But ... the latest timestamp
summary I can see there is from May 2009, so I guess the point stands,
unless it's just google groups that won't cooperate. (Hmmm, my news
server doesn't even carry alt.security.gpg, so I can't check further.
Not a good sign.)

Look at the date. This is an old story. Moreover, it was discussed right here on this list at the time.

It's not at all obvious. I asked about it on Math Overflow once, and got some interesting answers:
