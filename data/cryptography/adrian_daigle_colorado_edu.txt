Not sure what this has to do with cryptography, but ...
You really want phi(1) = 1. Whether you do it by using your second
or by using your first
and just defining phi(1) = 1 by fiat is up to you.
If you have phi(1) = 1, then phi becomes a multiplicative function:
And as every number theory guy knows, multiplicative functions are fun and
useful and all that stuff.
