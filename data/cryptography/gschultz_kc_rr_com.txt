Another theory is that it was accidental, as he apparently had an electroplating apparatus set up that used potassium cyanide. Fumes perhaps got him, or some got on his hands. He may have thought it was mere food poisoning, until it was too late.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Feedback welcome on an idea 
I have written up an idea (abstract below) for a high-security symmetric-key cipher allowing for manual decryption, i.e., without requiring a computer.  What distinguishes it is the ability to encrypt multiple messages in the same ciphertext.  If caught, one can reveal a decoy message instead of the real one.  Encryption does require a computer however, which limits its applicability to a very few situations.
Having said that, it was an enjoyable exercise.  If any are curious and would like to see the full PDF and comment on it, just let me know a good place to send/post it.
Thanks in advance.

Abstract:  With key logging trojans and other malware in the wild, and operating systems being too complex to protect against government surveillance, it is necessary to have high-security ciphers which can be used without the aid of a computer.  Some proposals in this area include Solitaire [1] and Handycipher [2]. The cipher described here further explores this space by introducing deniability.

For a military field cipher, that would be a definite requirement. This cipher is only intended for rare use in encrypting small amounts of data.  It's actually not meant to be operated under stress.  If captured and forced to talk, only reveal one of the decoy keys, then sit back and do nothing.

Yes, they of course will.  There is no ultimate solution to that problem.  The only hope is that they won't know how many keys were used, nor be able to recognize the right plaintext when they see it.

Few question for thought:
- With most cell phones in pockets, is the audio quality good enough for this kind of attack?
- Would an effective countermeasure be to enter passwords via less audible means, such as touchscreens or mice, and picking out buttons on the screen?
- What if we simply press the keys more slowly to where they don't reach their maximum stroke and cause much audible output?
- I've wondered about the following:  If the NSA/FBI/etc. capabilities are as far-reaching as we fear, wouldn't they (FBI in particular) have the ability to conquer organized crime by now? Wouldn't they pwn any computer being used inside organized crime in other words?  (Of course if we're really paranoid, we could speculate that they are not putting organized crime out of business because it would tip their hand as to their capabilities...)

@_subject: [Cryptography] Brainstorming for encrypted text messaging 
I'm trying to brainstorm ideas for uncrackable encrypted text messaging over smartphones.  Since any software running on the phone is subject to being hacked, the encryption would have to take place on a separate device before the message was entered on the phone.
But unless you soldered it together yourself (and maybe not even then), you couldn't be sure that an electronic device was not also pre-hacked by the NSA or the Chinese, et al.  Or its electromagnetic emanations could be intercepted.  So I'm thinking along the lines of a mechanical device.  Of course, no pocket-size mechanical cipher device (consider the Kryha Liliput for instance) could possibly incorporate enough complexity to resist cryptanalysis...unless...
What if the encryption method was the one-time pad?  Naively, you could carry a one-time pad on paper, along with a pencil.  You would perform the en/decryption manually, and type the message into the phone.  (Of course the smartphone with its cameras would be in your pocket during Besides pencil and paper, is there any sort of mechanism you can envision that would aid in en/decryption in conjunction with a one-time pad, where (with the plaintext and key hidden) you could then photograph the ciphertext (perhaps showing on wheels of some sort), and transmit the photograph.  On the other end, the ciphertext could be manually entered into the recipient's device and decrypted.  This would bypass the tedium of typing random letters into the smartphone.
I realize any such method would be slow, cumbersome, and incriminating.  But this is just a mental exercise at this point. Thanks for any ideas.

My understanding of visual cryptography is that it requires the use of preprinted transparencies that can be held near or over the transmitted graphic to form the plain visual message.  The problem is how to get the transparency near the phone's display without the camera being able to snap a pic of it during that process. Furthermore, it requires software to generate the visual patterns and create the ciphertext.  But yes, I did consider that technology.

It would work, but you'd want something less unwieldy than a
    one-time pad. I think you would want some kind of purely mechanical
    device, so that users could verify for themselves that it is
    unhacked and unhackable.  All parts visible.
Yes, the all-parts-visible is the important aspect.
That's why I was aiming for a device that could show a line of text on a physical display (perhaps a stack of wheels of some sort), so that the ciphertext could just be photographed right off the device.

Thought about using paper tape (M. K. Shen), but (as with printing visual crypto transparencies) the tape would not be easy to punch. I don't have access to any vintage computer equipment either.
The pairs of 20 rotors, with one set showing from each side of the unit sounds promising, though.  (Might need some 3-D printer time...)  I had even considered that  for use with the one-time pad, where one set of wheels would be for the key, and one for plain/ciphertext.  You would reset the keywheels to "AAAA...", then enter the plaintext on the plain/cipher wheels.  Moving the plain/cipher wheels would _not_ cause the keywheels to move.  Then you would move the keywheels forward, based on the one-time key. Moving the key wheels _would_ step the plain/cipher wheels by the same amount.  This would add the key characters to the plaintext characters (modulo 26), leaving the ciphertext on those wheels. (The keywheel window could have a cover to prevent accidentally flashing it to the camera on the phone.)
The internal gearing would not be as complex, and would only connect the cipher/plaintext and key rotors of one pair at a time.  Your auto-keyed cipher idea would require some mechanical engineering that is beyond my

As long as the old phone is permanently air-gapped.  If you ever upload new software to it, malware could jump the gap.  This would be an even greater risk if you're using freely-available software that was already known to the 3-letter agencies, as their trojans would be scanning for known packages.
Even with photographing of QR codes, information could be exfiltrated from a phone, perhaps by displaying a blinking pixel someplace, which the other phone's camera would pick up.

I would bet it was Hollywood that was naive here.  William Friedman or many others in Washington D.C. would have known that 2371 possibilities was far too few to withstand cryptanalysis.  (Although it would be interesting if there were evidence that Washington folk insisted that Hollywood use that low number.  Any way to find out?)

If the manuscript was indeed the product of someone with a mental disorder, it is interesting that the characters/words seem to share the statistical properties of known languages:
A follow-up question might be whether schizophrenics (etc.) typically produce texts that follow Zipf's law, etc., the way normal languages do. If their text is "flatter" or otherwise statistically distinct, that would count against this theory. (I'm not able with a quick google to find results of statistical analysis of the speech of such individuals.)  (But it's a very creative angle to take in any case!)

I only glanced at the 161 pages of testimony from the trial, but I question this guy's claims:
1.? An expert never writes his own crypto (unless it's a custom implementation of a known-secure algorithm, done for who knows what reason).
2.? The idea of hiding data in slack space or hidden partitions has been known for quite some time, and should be very familiar to tens of thousands of people around the globe.
3.? Stego hides data as random or pseudorandom data, and thus is immediately suspect.? The only data that can't hide other data is completely (or nearly) uniform data.? (And even then, overwritten data can be recovered.)
Is the point that this guy is a little too proud of himself?
