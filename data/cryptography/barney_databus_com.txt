What's wrong with the ssh known-hosts approach, for this?  Do sites
change certs more often than sshd changes host keys?  Given how much
crap browsers cache already, this wouldn't seem to add much.
Of course it wouldn't help when using a public client host, but anybody
doing that for confidential web access is wide open anyway.

The list of trusted certs is part of the browser config, and can be
altered.  It would be hard to imagine a browser so badly written as
to hard-code that list.  Certainly Mozilla makes it easy (Manage Certs
under Privacy & Security in Edit Preferences) and I've even added
a self-signed server cert under IE with no trouble or inconvenience.
(Yes it did ask whether to accept the site's cert.)

@_subject: Reliance on Microsoft called risk to U.S. security 
While I agree that text is far safer than html or a .exe, do you run
Pine on a dumb terminal, or in a window?  If the latter, escape
sequences which most folks would class as "text" can lead to remote
compromise.  There have been occasional bugs in terminal emulators,
in X and others.  TERM=vt100 is in some sense defining an interpreted
programming language, albeit a limited one.
That absolute safety is impossible does not excuse software from our
favorite vendor whose security model is all but impossible to fathom,
so I'm not at all disagreeing with your point.  I use Mutt.

The fly in this ointment is that the testers (of whatever stripe)
are being trusted to reveal all the flaws that they find.  One way
of assuring that is flaw injection, but it's imperfect, because
you can never prove that failure to find the flaw was deliberate.
The same problem applies to penetration tests, which is why hiring
former felons to do it is not risk-free.

@_subject: DRM of the mirror universe 
DRM only works because the supplier of the content has itself certified
the software used to process the content, or trusts the entity that
has certified the software.  Who would you trust to certify the software
that some corporation will use to process your personal data?
Another issue is that DRM works best to protect massive content.  For
example, whether you are HIV-positive is a single bit.  How would you
prevent me from capturing that bit from my screen with a camera?  If
the DRM prevents any association of your data with your identity, the
data will not be worth much to me.
Also, even assuming the DRM works, what prevents the user from presenting
false data?  The only data I can't lie about is what I generate as a
side-effect of something else, for example a click-stream.  But that's
already available reliably to the server(s) now, without DRM.

Well, no - because you haven't disclosed why you chose that particular
book, and you could easily have tried a million or more books before
finding one that produced some desirable result, combined with an even
larger universe of manipulations you could have chosen.
I think somebody else said it, more or less, but the only foolproof
technique to put you above suspicion is to publish your method and
choice of a data seed you cannot predict or control, such as the closing
prices of the S&P500 stocks tomorrow, in a specified order and encoding.

I'm baffled.  You didn't trust the list server with the plaintext, but
you trusted every list member's computer?  So why didn't you use one of
them as the list server?

If you'll pardon a naive question, what happened to IVs?  How do you
arrange to get two ciphertexts with the same IV?  I thought the point
of IVs was so the attacker can't recognize identical plaintexts.

The problem arises when money paid for drugs, for example, or kiddie porn,
finds its way to finance terrorists.  Or when we are told that it does,
whether or not that is so.  And a sufficiently successful criminal
enterprise is indeed a national security threat.

So it's ok to declare war on Hezbollah but not on ISIS?  If I decide to
build my own WMD I'm a criminal but if Pakistan fails to prosecute the
guy who helps me then I'm an enemy combatant?
Seems to me the criterion should be the level of the threat, not fine
distinctions on who's making it.

I don't understand your concern with typing the SHA1 hash.  If you get a hit you are going to change the password and never use it again.  If you don't get a hit what can an attacker do with the hash?  Is there any system so stupid as to store passwords as unsalted SHA1 hashes?

Unless the algorithm is rot0 or the user is a savant, some software is being trusted. And I doubt that even a savant could handle video encryption at frame rate.

@_subject: [Cryptography] NSA security guidelines for videoconferencing 
Just to clear up any confusion, I meant "savant" as in "Rain Man" which seems not to have been obvious. My point was that if your threat model is a nefarious or fallible conferencing service, isn't that same service supplying the software you're running on the endpoint devices? Requiring that each end user obtain, compile and run an open source client might work in some environments, but probably does not scale, and the old question remains of why you trust the compiler.* Perhaps it would be useful to have the clients and the server written and controlled by strictly separated entities. You're still trusting the client software, of course.
* (Off topic, somewhat) I've always wondered whether "Reflections on Trusting Trust" was inspired by "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress."
