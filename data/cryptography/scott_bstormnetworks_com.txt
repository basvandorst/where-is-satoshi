@_subject: question about rsa encryption 
I have a question regarding RSA encryption - forgive me if this seems
amateur-ish -, but 'm still a beginner. I seem to recall reading
somewhere that there is some issue with directly encrypting data with an
RSA public key, perhaps some vulnerability, but I can't find any
reference after a cursory look. Does anyone know of any issue with using
RSA encryption to encrypt a symmetric key under the target's public key
if the encrypted value is public (e.g. sent over a network)?
