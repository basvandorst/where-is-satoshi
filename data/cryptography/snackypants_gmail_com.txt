Why would they perform the attack only for encryption software? They
could compromise people's laptops by spiking any popular app.

First time I've heard of 128-bit symmetric called "weak"... Sure, RC4
isn't awesome but they seem to be saying that 128-bit keys per se are
Without good server authentication, the other stuff doesn't matter.
With Chrome, you get key pinning when talking to some sites (including
Google sites, Tor, and Twtitter); I'd much rather have that and "only"
128-bit symmetric. Also, I don't know why you weren't getting forward
secrecy; check your Firefox configuration.

So they spike a popular download (security-related apps are less
likely to be popular) with a tiny malware add-on that scans every file
that it can read to see if it's an encryption key, cookie, password
db, whatever ? any credential-like thing. The malware uploads any hits
to the mothership, then exits (possibly cleaning up after itself).
Trivial to do, golden results.
But really, why not leave a little C&C pinger behind? Might as well;
you never know when it will be useful.

I wouldn't pick on/fear/call out the Chinese specifically.
Also, be aware that browsers must transitively trust all the issuers
that the known trust anchors have issued issuing certificates for.
That's a much bigger set, and is not currently fully knowable.
(Another reason to crave Certificate Transparency.)
