Without looking at your specific implementation, I had a similar
question but regarding to ECIES combined with ECDSA. See
for the answers.

@_subject: [Cryptography] NTP Security (Was: Re:  Random numbers only once) 
I'd like to point you to a recent internet draft, partly written by a
colleague of mine:
It is the result of several security problems with the old "NTP autokey"
protocol (which hopefully nobody really uses...)
If you have comments or questions, don't hesitate to post on this
mailinglist, I can point him to this conversation.

I am also very much interested in an answer to this question. Just read

Has there been progress from 2001 to today in OpenPGP's standard
regarding this problem?

Standards take time...

@_subject: [Cryptography] distributing fingerprints etc. via QR codes etc. 
I encourage you to try our open source app OpenKeychain [0]. It is far
from perfect and we like to improve the UI flow for key exchange and
certifications to get a more guided experience when exchanging keys, but
nevertheless, you can already exchange keys via NFC, QR Code, and a hash
commitment based approach by the SafeSlinger library. The SafeSlinger
approach is extremely comfortable for key signing parties, we just need
to implement the next step, that is certification of multiple keys,
which should be done directly after the exchange and import [1].
We like to hear feedback and suggestion regarding everything [2].
