What happens when you do it to /dev/random?
My understanding was that /dev/random while on return data if it
has enough entrophy , otherwise it blocks. /dev/urandom will get its
values from /dev/random until it blocks then it continues by output psuedo The use of /dev/urandom is for non-cryptographic stuff that can't block
on it's reads, like a read to /dev/random would.
Plus, shouldn't you only be using it as a seed to a Yarrow or a FIPS PRNG like X917?
