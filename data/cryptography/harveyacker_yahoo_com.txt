@_subject: [IP] Master Key Copying Revealed (Matt Blaze of ATT Labs) 
The content, once extracted, was interesting to
someone who did not know how locks worked, but the
attack was obvious as soon as one read the description
of how master keys worked.
To dress this up with "P(H-1) key blanks", "rights
amplification", oracles, and other crypto analogies,
was silly.
