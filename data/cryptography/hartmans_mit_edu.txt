No.  opportunistic encryption means I have retrieved a key or cert for
the other party, but do not know whether it is actually the right
cert.  This is slightly different although at the level of current
discussion it has the same security properties.

Note that for at least one of the uses of anonymous ipsec you
specifically don't want this behavior because you specifically don't
want people to cache keys in an ssh known_hosts style.  For other uses
you would want this behavior.

Peter, list, the W3C W Web Security Context working group is in the
final week of a public last call on their user interface guidelines.
These guidelines take a lookboth at the balance between EV-certs and
at user interface for security indicators.
Comments need to be received by September 15. The draft is at
 and my take is at
 .
