Hi Felix,
It seems to me that your suggestion works, given some assumptions:
1. Long-lived process on the receiving client
2. Long-lived process on the server
3. Receiving client can contact server regularly to upload keys
4. Sending client can contact server before sending to receive a key
5. Receiving client can contact sender if message can't be decrypted
(presumably this response isn't encrypted, to avoid infinite regress)
6. Some kind of protection against key exhaustion attacks
Those seem like reasonable assumptions on the internet, but perhaps
not for other settings like mesh networks or DTNs.
Any thoughts about how to achieve number 6?
