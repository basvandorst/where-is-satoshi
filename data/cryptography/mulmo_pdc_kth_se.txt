DCMA comes to mind: it could potentially make it a little harder to get
your hands on any mass market eavesdropping tool.
If you are terribly concerned about this, there are end-to-end encryption
phones on the market that are used by military and others already today.
Such systems come with a price tag though: As for me, the ordinary end
user, I just have be as careful with what I say or trust when communicating
over the phone as when I'm using email.
But that should have already been the case, had I thought things through,
and shouldn't come as a shock.

"Laughing my ass off."  Since when do governments care about patents? How would this help/harm them from exploiting it?   Not that
high-end LEOs haven't already had this capacity ---Biham et al
are only the first *open* researchers to reveal this.

@_subject: Bluetooth cracked further 
Correction: Most manufacturers hardcode the 4-digit PIN to 0000. It has been known for some time that those "gadgets" need to be paired in an Faradayic environment: if I recall correctly, a paper being presented on this at the RSA conference ~2001 or so.
The forced re-pairing vulnerability is news to me. It makes me very concerned about Bluetooth keyboards...

Seems to me that a CA can nullify this attack by choosing a serial number or RDN component (after all, a CA should vet the DN and not simply sign what's in the PKCS request), such that the public key does not end up at an "appropriate" DER-encoded offset in the certificate. Or am I completely lost?

Peter's example is "standard to the language". It's just not used much by those influenced by other idioms prior to learning Java.
I guess another way of saying this is: the people on this list are getting old. :-)

Unfortunately, they haven't. In Europe I get receipts with different  crossing-out patterns almost every week.
And, with "they" I mean the builders of point-of-sale terminals: I  don't think individual store owners are given a choice.
Though I believe I have noticed a good trend in that I get receipts  where *all but four* digits are crossed out more and more often
