@_subject: [Cryptography] What's a Plausible Attack On Random Number 
As a postscript to this thread, I'd note the existence of these older open source random number generation projects as an example of prior art:
The last revision of the prngd code is 2007. So while this is inspired by some good ideas it's not being actively developed today.
They were developed to support Unix/Linux systems which didn't have a They use the output of various commands to collect entropy, in a configurable-sized pool.
I've used prngd in a previous context where I was administering a web A feature is that there is a trivial protocol for requesting random bytes in clear text over a TCP socket.
I used that protocol to ship some random bytes from the primary web server via private fiber to the hot spare at another location which had little traffic.
But our only use of random numbers there was for SSH, neither server used HTTPS.

This seems to be a misplaced threat model. Once an adversary has physical access to a device sufficient to read a stored random seed, they have other ways to compromise the system.
There may be no one-size-fits-all answer. Providing means to manage a random seed across reboots or provision it for a VM from a hypervisor seem like they could help important corner cases.

Another consideration is that the NSA isn't the only bad actor out there. Improving the robustness of TLS and other security protocols will defend against other attacks.

@_subject: [Cryptography] ideas for (long) Nothing up my sleeve numbers 
In this kind of construction, the "something up my sleeve" may appear to be how you picked the starting point and other details.
Also note there are algorithms to compute the Nth digit of pi in various bases without computing the previous digits, so there is no particular reason to stick with digits in published literature.
But I'd argue you might as well start at the first non-zero binary digit of pi, and reduce the degrees of freedom in the choice.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Sony finding SHA1 collisions? 
It sounds like they are seeding torrents with claimed hashes that that don't match the files they are seeding, so nothing cryptographically complex, just adding garbage to the environment.

@_subject: [Cryptography] sunsetting SHA-1 in Chrome 
How do the Chrome and Microsoft deprecations of SHA1 view the use of SHA1 in TLS cipher suites?
As I understand it SHA1 is being used in a HMAC in TLS, which is somewhat stronger than SHA1 alone in a certficate.  There's some reason to suspect both, but it's a different case.
Alternatives to SHA1 in TLS doesn't seem to show up until TLS 1.2.

@_subject: [Cryptography] ratcheting DH strengths over time 
This isn't an unreasonable idea; at the same time views of "How breakable is algorithm X with strength Y" change over time.
The proposal to drop support for SHA1 in signatures 6 months sooner is this kind of decision; without there being an immediate attack on practical SHA1 signatures, the perception of risk has altered.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Secure VNC implementation 
RealVNC uses protocol extensions to do AES encryption and use OS passwords, not the trivial passwords of the original VNC protocol, so it's a substantially different protocol than all the free VNC implementations out there, that doesn't rely on SSH Tunneling.
It seems to be a solid, supported commercial product with clients and servers for several platforms.  One licenses a server, their VNC client for Windows is free.
I'm using the Windows version, I've had some practical difficulties with getting the server to restart after MS patching and with something else capturing the terminal session on occasion, but those don't appear to be protocol weaknesses.
