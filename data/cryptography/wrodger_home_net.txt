Yes, but I was thinking a bit differently: The AV companies have to get a copy of the malware to analyze in the first place to stop the Trojan, or at least or block something _very_ similar. I don't think either one is likely with half-competent Trojan writers.
So, I asked,  rhetorically:
Declan says:
It seems to me they will have to get tons better at what they do before they can stop someone clicking on an attachment, for instance.
Tthere's a balancing act here: Do you risk your Trojan being discovered by McAfee and Symantec, or do you risk someone blabbing when you ask them to avoid blocking it, when the odds are they  won't block it in the foreseeable future?
Given what I know of leaks to the media (my time as a reporter at USA Today and Ziff Davis has to be worth something here) I wouldn't even think of approaching the AV companies about this.
But that's just me. The Fibbies may have it figured differently.
all the best,

Declan --
While we're all pondering whether or not McAfee talked to the FBI, I have to wonder: How likely is it the FBI would want to talk to about their keystroke logger, anyway?
The Trojan horse -- if it indeed exists -- won't likely be seen in the wild. Wide distribution would defeat the surreptitious nature of the alleged Magic Lantern. It would also violate Fourth Amendment protections in ways that would make even AG Ashcroft blush.
We also know that virus scanners are remarkably bad at picking up and stopping new malware. If they were any good at all, new viri and Trojans would not spread the way they do.
So -- We have a Trojan horse that
--will likely land on a handful of computers a year
--should not propagate
--will operate silently, and
--whose existence remains classified.
How hard would it be to design a Trojan horse that could get around current I am quite certain that Ted Bridis got his story right. I am less certain that his sources told him the truth.

@_subject: Sen. Hollings plans to introduce DMCA sequel: The SSSCA 
Before we engage in the usual tirades against the Great Satan, let's note this:
Round about the time the recording industries were hobbling DAT decks to make sure they would not threaten their business, there was an attempt to make the PC industry build in anti-copy technology like the one in digital tape decks. The computer hardware lobby, assisted by some non-profits, killed the measure handily.
I see little reason to believe we won't see a similar result this time, especially given the huge issue (finally!) digital copyright has become. After all, what hardware company wants to sell a hobbled computer whose main purpose is to protect someone else's line of business?
Hollings will make more enemies than he cares to think of if he proceeds with this dead-on-arrival bill.
