@_subject: Kerberos Design 
I'm currently looking into implementing a single sign-on solution for
distributed services. The requirement profile seems to somewhat fit Kerberos, but I'm
not entirely convinced that I can use it in my scenario - which can't
simply run an off-the-shelf KDC and use UDP for communication with it.
However, years of reading various crypto resources have strongly
conditioned me against simple-minded attempts to "roll my own" as a
crypto dilletante.
I've been trying to study Kerberos' design history in the recent past
and have failed to come up with a good resource that explains why things
are built the way they are. Since I'm already using OpenSSL for various SSL/x.509 related things,
I'm most astonished by the almost total absence of public key
cryptography in Kerberos, and I haven't been able to find out why this
design choice was made - performance reasons, given that at its
inception public key operation cost was probably much more prohibitive?
So, I'd like to ask the audience:
- Is there a good web/book/whatever resource regarding the design
  of Kerberos? Amazon offers the O'Reilly book, which, from the   abstract, seems to take the cryptographic design of Kerberos as   a given and concentrates on its usage, and another one that also
  doesn't seem to give much detail on the issue. Something in the
  direction of EKR's SSL/TLS book would be very much appreciated.
- Is Kerberos a sane choice to adapt for such solutions today?
  Is there anything more recent that I should be aware of?
