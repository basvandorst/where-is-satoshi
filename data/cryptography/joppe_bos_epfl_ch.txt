@_subject: 112-bit prime ECDLP solved 
Hi all,
We are pleased to announce that we have set a new record for the elliptic
curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) by solving it over a 112-bit
finite field. The previous record was for a 109-bit prime field and
dates back from October 2002. Our calculation was done on a cluster of
more than 200 PlayStation 3 game consoles at the EPFL.
See for more details our announcement at Best regards,
Joppe Bos
