That quote in full:
'Daniel J. Bernstein
Patent 6202150 claims generating keys with "a proof that the keys were generated by a specific algorithm". Nobody does that. Bogus lawsuit.'

@_subject: [Cryptography] TB2F CAs as (un)official browser policy 
A real RA's login credentials were used.  The attacker obtained those login credentials by hacking into the RA's system.
Nit: We misissued nine certs.
Indeed.  We notified the major browser providers the same day, and we released the facts into the public domain as quickly as we could.  (One of the browser providers asked us to delay going public for a week so that they had sufficient time to produce and test the required patches).

None that I can think of.
Perhaps it would be useful to define a new certificate extension that enables a single certificate to carry signatures from multiple CAs (where each signature is an assertion that that CA has independently verified the details in the cert).  Of course it would only be useful if the CAs and browsers were interested in implementing it.

Yay for CT indeed, but FWIW it wasn't CT that detected this one.
The Bluecoat intermediate ( first came to light when Symantec disclosed it to Mozilla.
I'm tracking intermediates that have been disclosed to Mozilla but not (yet) submitted to CT (see   When I saw the Bluecoat intermediate, I submitted it to some CT logs.
