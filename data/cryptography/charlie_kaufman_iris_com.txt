@_subject: crypto flaw in secure mail standards 
Actually, that's not true. The encrypted and signed email
functionality contained in Lotus Notes encrypts only body
fields and attachments, but signs the To:, From:, CC:,
I wouldn't call this a cryptographic flaw. I'd call it a flaw
in cryptographic engineering. And it's not a flaw borne out of
ignorance. The designers of the standard protocols knew about
the problem (I was there for some of them), but didn't think
their proposed standard would be acceptable if it "committed
layer violations" by extending signature coverage to data not
contained in their "layer". This is a classic example of
something a competent engineer can get right, but which a suite
of committees can't.

p.s. Ironically, Lotus Notes is transitioning from its
proprietary email format to S/MIME and trying to figure out how
to make it clear to customers that when they use the new
format, they don't get the protection they may have gotten used
