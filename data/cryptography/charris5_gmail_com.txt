@_subject: [Cryptography] Music players that don't promote eavesdropping? 
The Music Player Daemon (mpd) and an mpd client (I recommend ncmpcpp)
should work for you.  It is completely ncurses based so you /would/
technically need to run in a terminal session; but I find this a
non-issue personally.  It _does_ have the ability to fetch artist data
from last.fm; however this can be easily switched on/off. I'm not 100% sure,
but I don't believe the last.fm fetch is even enabled by default.
Here's a guide to setting up mpd and ncmpcpp on ArchLinux, but I've also
set it up on debian and Fedora systems as well, so no worries about
distro dependence.
