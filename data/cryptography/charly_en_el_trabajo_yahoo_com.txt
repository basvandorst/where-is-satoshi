Hello, What do you think is worst having enabled, POODLE or TLS with 56 bit keys?
The problem I have is that due to a short list of available TLS ciphersuites, an unacceptable percentage of the traffic will go down if I disable SSL.
Thank you

Thank you, Rich, but the only thing that I can do is turn on or off the available ciphersuites, it is a dilemma, I am stuck on an old server version.

Install the SCSV fallback. Modern clients (say those written shortly after the start of this century) will do TLS, older ones can use SSL, and you can avoid having the modern ones tricked into acting like older ones.? The server-side code is pretty easy to do, and is bundled into OpenSSL since the time of disclosure.
Note that this will catch many false-positives because of network hiccups and browsers not always being able to tell when it's the network and when it's the server denying them.

I am auditing some code that I think that is crap and I have to demonstrate it without access to it, it is black box testing.
The data is something like this and I have ten rows
Variable  Variable TS                   Signature
ID1       ID2                              3242424   34      2015-10-31 23:59:59   a1a2b3A4A
3242425   34      2015-10-31 23:59:59   123456Aab
3242426   34      2015-10-31 23:59:59   abcdefABC
I bet on that Signature is a function of ID1, ID2 and TS without any additional secret.
I think that there is a process that could help me deduce that function. Could some one hint me some keywords?
Thank you

I will begin trying the one bit -> half the bits approach. If it backups my feeling, I will insist on accessing the source code.
The odd length is due to UX. My first thought was a common hash being truncated, but the mixing upper or lower cases hints that they are not using the hexadecimal representation of a common hash like md5. It talks about a clever in-house algorithm :-)
During the year I will have 500 more rows every month. Someday I will share the experience, I hope.
