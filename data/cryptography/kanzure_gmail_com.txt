What is the advantage of that over, say, detecting CryptoLocker and
killing its process or scanning files before they hit a user's
machine? Also, given a generic CryptoLocker detector, other viruses
will definitely sit around waiting to see CryptoLocker, steal the
keys, and then charge less than whatever CryptoLocker is demanding.

@_subject: [Cryptography] What has Bitcoin achieved? 
That design looks like a response to something that is slightly
different from the original threat model that Bitcoin was proposing.
Although, I would be interested in hearing dissenting opinions on
whether or not the two threat models are comparable?

Could you provide any of those signatures and examples please? I have
talked with a bunch of bitcoin programmers and nobody can find anything
that was ever signed by "the Satoshi key". Thank you.

Here are some links in that direction:

.. last one has good video, some history of probabilistically checkable proof (PCP) stuff:
quadratic arithmetic/span programs (non-interactive zero knowledge
proofs without probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs)) (GGPR):
Recently I gave a presentation with a very high level and general
overview of ways to (ab)use SNARKs for bitcoin scalability reasons:

@_subject: [Cryptography] A conversation with Dan Boneh (2016-08-01 transcript) 
Some Bitcoin developers and miners went to visit with Dan Boneh at Stanford
earlier this month, and I thought I would share what we talked about.
Topics discussed include elliptic curve crypto, ECDSA, Schnorr signatures,
signature aggregation, BLS signature schemes, pairing crypto, group
signatures, block-level signature aggregation, transaction-level signature
aggregation, post-quantum crypto, quantum mining ASICs, provable solvency
schemes, scrypt password hashing, and balloon hashing.

@_subject: [Cryptography] [Crypto-practicum] Please critique this 
Your trusted third-party can forge multiple conflicting alternate histories
and then choose to only share those histories with different users. If a
double spend is later found, or inflation or something else, then you end
up with potentially many years of subsequent activity built on top of the
fraud, and users often have no recourse at that point. In bitcoinland there
is a similar theoretical problem where miners might choose to withhold
information used to construct overly large blocks: even if you have a
system where you can create fraud proofs, you cannot guarantee that the
miners will publish all the data included in a block-- why would anyone
ever show you the full set of information required to prove the inclusion
of double spends (or other rule violations)?
Btw for your purposes I also recommend looking into these opentransactions

What happened to that project- did it get into production, and how did it
Also, why was Digicash's ecash only deployed in little "fiefdoms" instead
of a central clearing model?
