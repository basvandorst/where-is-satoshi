@_subject: Source discrimination. 
My search is not directly related to cryptography, except perhaps, as
part of the stegonograph y threads: Does anyone know of a source package that can discriminate
vocal/ambient noise sources from musical/instrumental sources?  Ie,
instruments vs voice?  I'm aware of various canned bandpass
approaches, which work (sorta) for karoke use, but don't quite work
for what I'm trying to do.  (I want to preserve both "channels" for
separate analysis.)

... snipt ... The problem of keeping track of Windows updates/patches and installing
them just got a whole lot bigger.  Especially considering their past
claims that IE, and a bunch of other silly stuff, has to be part of the
OS.  Picking and choosing what portions of a package to fingerprint is going
to be a real headscratcher for some companies.

... snipt ... Say 3/4ths of the world office use Microsoft software of one variety or
another and they all need regular reloading for proper operation.
Say a large aircraft full of fuel torches the place, some fanatical
bunch of wackos nuke the place, or maybe, some demented engineering
student lobs a home-made EMP device onto the lawn?  What's the world gonna do when the master licensing borg croaks and
nobody can (re)license their office equipment warez?
Is this disaster recovery a Microsoft issue or a US Government national
security issue?

The first pass at this I had a lot of crosstalk in the office and
mangled things, badly.  One more time:
Say 3/4ths of the world offices use Microsoft software of one variety or
another and these systems all need regular reloading for proper
operation.  After reloading, you hook up with MS's computers in Redmond
to (re)license things.
Say a large aircraft full of fuel torches the place (Microsoft's campus
in Redmond), some fanatical bunch of wackos nuke the place, or maybe,
some demented engineering student lobs a home-made EMP device onto the
lawn?  What's the world gonna do when the master licensing borg croaks and
nobody can (re)license their office equipment warez?

@_subject: DRM technology and policy 
Ya, in an ideal world.
It's been a few years since I've driven in LA, but the last time I did,
it also seemed like there were huge variable costs, the cost of image
maintenance.  "Image maintenance", in this case, being keeping media
execs shoulder deep in fast cars, fast women, and (IMO) abundant
supplies of the current image-enhancing drug.
IMO, we'd all be better off if the media companies threw their R&D
budgets at drug research, instead of DRM.   The benefits derived from an
image enhancing drug that made people smarter -- instead of stupid or
pathologically goofy -- while ensuring fresh breath, fresh intimate
odors, clear eyes, and a glossy coat, would be phenomenal. After that, maybe I'd trust 'em to require DRM on my toaster oven hosted
music library.

People that deal in postal mailing lists do this also.  Their clients
contract to use the names on the lists a certain number of times, and no
more.  A percentage of the addresses in the lists are "seeds", which
allow the list vendor to track how their lists are being used.

@_subject: DeCSS, crypto, (regions removed??!) 
Googling for code-free or region-free turns up quite a few.  The most
handy is buyers guide site  with links to
          (Ya, they all look like the same site.)
 has a $140 player with instructions on how to make it
region-free without swapping proms.   Worth a look.

@_subject: Verizon must comply with RIAA's DMCA subpoena 
That rips it.
I'm conserving juice at the outlet, which limits my entertainment
options and makes me much less of a consumer; new cars have/will-have
GPS to track my donut foraging travels, and are made like crap, so I'm
definitely not buying another; I'm already boycotting all music and
video media, due the goofiness in Hollywood; and now I'll say goodbye to
ISPs that narc for the world government -- 1st world gov, 3rd world, I'm
not sure and who can tell the difference, today anyway.
Does any portion of whatever world government have totalistic designs on
the Yukon?  Sure, the canadian government probably has a stack of
tourist/emmigration forms to fill out, and they'd hate it if I just
dropped out of sight there.  But, if I wore a white parka and ski pants,
I'd look just like another underfed polar bear.  Surely polar bears
aren't on anyone's hit-list?
