@_subject: Palladium and buffer over runs 
What is there to prevent that one single undisclosed buffer overrun bug in a component such as Internet Explorer won't shoot down the whole DRM scheme of Palladium ? Presumably IE will be able to run while the machine is in a trusted state, but if the IE can be subverted by injecting compromising code through a buffer overrun, the security of DRM material that is viewed in one window could be compromised through malicious code that has been introduced through another browser window.
The OS should change all memory pages to Read Only + Executable, after it has checked the signature of an application, and the CPU could trigger an exception if code is executed in a page that isn't tagged as Executable. However Windows and Intel CPUs don't work this way... Count the number of buffer over runs already found in IE, seems very likely that an attacker would be able to discover a new one without disclosing it...
