Can any one tell me whats Kerchoff's principle
[Moderator's note: It is a set of principles, actually, about how to
build crypto systems that are secure. The most important is that you
must assume that the adversary will eventually learn the details of
your cryptographic algorithms, so the security of the system must rest
entirely in the key selected and not in the details of the algorithm. --Perry]
