An interesting bit of information: on Tuesday afternoon, to the extend that
cellphones operated, GSM encryption was turned off throughout Manhattan. My
GSM phone would repeatedly warn me of this on every call I made (or tried
to make). As of Wednesday morning, things were back to normal.
Does anyone have more details on this ?

Niels Provos (U. of Michigan) has a very interesting paper on detecting
steganography on the network (he talked about it during the USENIX Sec. WIP
session). Basically, he didn't find any steganography in about 2 million images
he tested on Ebay. He's working on doing the same for other mediums/sites.
As the paper has not been published yet, I don't want to give more details. I've
cc'ed Niels on this message, so perhaps we'll get a summary of his latest

In message , Sam The above URLs point to the first paper, on statistical analysis of
steganographic content in images and on a method to bypass them (as implemented
in Outguess 0.2); there is a followup paper that talks about applying this
method for large-scale stego detection. This second paper is as yet
unpublished, and that's what I was referring to.

The phone I was using is an Ericsson T39 ("world" model). Of course, it
was using the 1.9G band (nothing else is available in the US, AFAIK).
Most of the day I was around 116 Street (Columbia U. campus), but at around
7pm I went to West 4 Street (they hadn't closed that part off yet), and the
problem persisted.
Just to clarify -- the phone was working, but the encryption was off (I suppose
that could be classified as "not working" :-)

Yes (according to the paper). Niels is apparently stuck in Greece at the moment,
which is probably why he's not responding...

WWW2006 Refereed Track: Security, privacy & Ethics
Viruses, spyware, and identity theft are turning the World Wide Web into a dangerous place. By undermining consumer trust, these problems are hampering e-commerce and the growth of online communities. A basic lesson is coming home to researchers, operators, and ordinary users alike: Security and privacy are not frills or features, but vital and enabling building blocks. As Web-based systems take on a physical dimension through wireless devices and sensors, and as they absorb varied media ? from books to online games to home movies ? digital security is ramifying in its economic and social reach.
This track promotes the view that security, privacy, and sound guiding ethics must be part of the texture of a successful World Wide Web. In addition to devising practical tools and techniques, it is the duty of the research community to promote and guide business adoption of security technology for the Web and to help inform related legislation.
The organizers seek novel research in security, privacy, and ethics as they relate to the Web, including but not limited to the following areas:
     * Biometrics and secure template management
     * Digital Rights Management from its technical, ethical, and legal      * Economic / business analysis of Web security and privacy
     * Electronic commerce, particularly security mechanisms for e-cash, auctions, payment, and fraud detection
     * Intrusion detection, insider threats, auditing, and honeypots
     * Legal and legislative approaches to issues of Web security and      * Location-based services
     * Knowledge-based authentication, such as security questions for password recovery
     * Privacy-enhancing technologies, including anonymity, pseudonymity and identity management
     * Public-key infrastructure and supporting concepts like digital signatures and certification
     * Secure and robust management of server farms
     * User interfaces as they relate to digital signing, encryption, passwords, and online scams like phishing
     * Wireless devices that interface with the Web, including RFID, sensors, and mobile phones
     * Web-services and supporting standards like XML

For more details, see The World's WWW Conference
WWW2006 will bring together the international communities of researchers, developers and business that drive the Web forward, shaping and developing its potential for new areas of communication, research, business and public administration.
Since the first international WWW Conference in 1994, this prestigious event, organized by the International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2), has provided the annual public forum for communicating research and development of the Web infrastructure and applications, as well as W3C initiatives.
The fifteenth conference in the series comes to the UK for the first time, and to one of the great historical centres of science and technology. Edinburgh is Scotland's capital city, home to one of the UK's oldest universities, an epicentre of the IT business sector and one of the world's great festival cities.
The WWW2006 programme addresses topics in media, e-government, e-commerce, education and e-science. The technical programme will draw on global research and industrial strengths to provide a strategic forum for the dissemination of new techniques and applications throughout the research community, the business and company sector and government agencies.
