Maybe this is the case in the USA but from my own informal surveys in
Helsinki and London I've found that 90% of private WLANs operate with WEP
enabled (FWIW).  Those with no WEP often appear to be deliberate,
indicated by 'welcoming' SSIDs.  Commercial WLAN operators also typically
choose to deploy with no WEP, controlling access via transparent proxying
or similar methods.
If WLAN systems were supplied supposedly 'secure' out of the box,
consumers might have even less interest in changing defaults.  Automated
key distribution at set-up time would likely introduce its own problems.
I'm fairly sure that J. Consumer connecting their home PC to DSL or cable
with no firewall typically expose themselves to greater risk than
deploying 802.11b with no WEP.

The paper addresses countermeasures; it would appear that the original PIN is
not stored for reuse in most (any?) implementations, but that there is an option
to use a PIN every time the devices are connected, which would expose this risk:

subjected to both attacks and the vulnerability to these attacks.
Bluetooth signals from leaking outside the desired boundaries. Therefore, one
should follow the recommendation in the Bluetooth standard and refrain from
entering the PIN into the Bluetooth device for pairing as much as possible. This
reduces the risk of an attacker eavesdropping on the pairing process and finding
the PIN used.
future use. This way, when the same Bluetooth devices wish to communicate again,
they use the stored link key. However, there is another mode of work, which
requires entering the PIN into both devices every time they wish to communicate,
even if they have already been paired before. This mode gives a false sense of
security! Starting the pairing process every time increases the probability of
an attacker eavesdropping on the messages transferred. We suggest not to use
this mode of work.

ability to use longer PINs.

Wrote?  Well, quoted...
For some values of 'most.'  This would cover mice, keyboards and wireless
headsets.  My MS Bluetooth mouse doesn't need any PIN or even encryption to
connect...  I've yet to see a Bluetooth-capable telephone with a fixed PIN; I
would doubt that the number of shipped BT mice, keyboards and headsets exceeds
the number of BT-capable telephones in existence.
Your attacker would need to keep a device live and in the neighbourhood of your
Bluetooth keyboard to perform a mitm attack; I'd be more worried about the
non-Bluetooth wireless keyboards out there.
ps, it's a little ironic that a post to a cryptography list has its digital
signature stripped before reaching the list, no?
