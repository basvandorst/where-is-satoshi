Any references for either the weaknesses of md5, or what the IETF has to say on the issue?

A couple of years ago at the RSA conference one of the vendors was exhibiting a tamperproof that would keep a secret key and perform encryptions/signatures using the key.  Since the key never left the box, in theory security reduced to physical security around the box.  The intended use of the box was as a master for a CA.  I thought the vendor was GTE, but I didn't find anything definitive on their site.
Does this description trigger any recollection?  Are there similar devices on the market from other sources?

Different models.  You state in your previous note that it is important
that all the endpoints be trusted.  Traffic between military bases,
embassies etc all involve trusted endpoints.  A public website is
intrinsically not a trusted endpoint. Moreover, addition of "cover browsing" by the hub to random websites
doesn't add any significant protection if the goal is to provide
real-time access.

Hmm.  While I agree with your assessment of likelihood, I think you
understate the seriousness of the issue in both the C case and the
assembler case -- they are not really that different.  It's not just a
matter of indirection and obfuscation -- there can be large blocks of
code generated for which there is no external visibility whatsoever (ie,
the map files and other traces of generated code can simply not show the
hidden code.  This is true both for C and assembler.  The only way you
can really tell is if you capture *all* of the live memory of the
computer, and disassemble it with a verified disassembler. (eg, what shows as bss 0 in the assembler listing is really code; what shows as one set of instructions in the listing is in reality different.)

You seem to be describing the characteristics of a particular assembler. Though I may not have expressed it well, my point was really at a
different level.  The entire program building system, of which the the
loader, assembler, and compiler are all parts, is susceptible. Thompson's paper described a very clever way of embedding a trojan in a
compiler, but there are multiple places in the program building system
where compromises of a similar flavor could occur -- my favorite
hypothetical has been the binary library manager (I worked on one for
the Cray-1 series, many years ago). The process you describe is a rather daunting task, especially given
that all that is really necessary is a very small bit of code to load
more code from a different file.

Presuming that Bob and Alice have previously exchanged correct public

============================== START ==============================
"Private".  Not a religious term, as far as I know.
I would think that the cryptographers in question would be even more
frustrated that so few products were available, to tell you the truth,
and would therefore be eager to help when someone makes an honest
attempt.   But alas, that seems not to be the case.
And, given the recent set of widely publicized flaws in openssl and
openssh, I think that concern about monoculture in cryptography software
is pretty damn well founded.

Forgive my doltishness, but could you expand on that just a bit, please (or
point at the right place in the docs)? I've used openvpn to set up dedicated
tunnels, but it isn't immediately obvious to me how it would be configured to
do opportunistic encryption.

You're arguement is that DHS couldn't do this covertly, but that's only part
of the picture.  I can imagine scenarios where they do things *overtly*.
1) It's untrusted now.
2) The argument could be that they are doing it to make it more trusted.
I agree: highly unlikely.  But not impossible.
