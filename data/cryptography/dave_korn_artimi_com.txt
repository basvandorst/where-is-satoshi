1.  The disk is encrypted using a long, secure, random, symmetric
en/de-cryption key.  (EDK for short).
2.  The EDK is encrypted with a passphrase and stored in a header at the
start of the encrypted disk
3.  If you change the passphrase on the disk, it simply reencrypts the EDK
using the new passphrase.  It does not generate a new EDK and it does not
re-encrypt the entire disk.
4.  Therefore the EDK itself is still the same, and if you overwrite the new
header (with the EDK encrypted by the new passphrase) using a stored copy of
the old header (with the same EDK encrypted under the old passphrase), you
have effectively changed the passphrase back - without having to have
knowledge of the new passphrase - and can now regain access using the old

it was on FD or perhaps Bugtraq.  His interpretation is somewhat coloured by
his transparent belief that these are big corporate monstrosities and hence

exaggerations/inaccuracies; for instance, when he claims that you can break
the decryption using a debugger, he forgets to mention that this only
applies to a disk where you originally knew the passphrase and have since
changed it.  It's more of a usage/documentation issue, really; an end-user
might believe that changing the passphrase re-encrypted the entire disk
beyond their ability to retrieve it.

Because it is completely incorrect.  Utterly wrong.  This was explained on
this list just a couple of days ago, look for the thread "A security bug in
PGP products?" in the list archives.
  No, the paper is wrong.  They aren't affected, you can't break the
encryption on them, and therefore there is no backdoor.
  It is not a hoax.  It is the work of an incompetent.  Like many of those who
invent perpetual motion machines, he genuinely believes that what he has done
is correct, but it isn't.  Unfortunately, but also very much like many of
those who invent perpetual motion machines, when this is pointed out to him he
assumes that everyone else is either stupid or malicious, rather than accept
that his theory has a massive flaw which completely undermines it.
  Actually, it can't, because the instructions he has given are not sufficient
to follow.  At the critical point, he says you must replace the bytes where
the disk encryption key is stored.  Unfortunately, he cannot tell you what to
replace them with, unless you already happen to have a copy of the bytes
representing that *exact* *same* disk encryption key stored *under* *a*
*known* *passphrase*, and that is why the only example on his website that
"works" is the one where you change the passphrase on a disk but don't
re-encrypt it.  He even admits that in all other cases you will "extract

explain what he has skipped over:  Using only your debugger, you need to guess

  The author has made the *exact* same error as when someone comes up with a
magical compression algorithm that they say can compress absolutely any data
down to a tiny size.  They always get the data to compress, sure, but they
always have problems with the decompression stage.  They tend to think that
this is just a minor bug in their decompressor they need more time to work on,
but no amount of time will let them work around the fundamental mathematical
fact that they've not got sufficient information in their compressed file to
reconstruct the original.
  Similarly, this author has successfully bypassed the protection built into
pgp that prevents you mounting a disk using the wrong encryption key, and has
decrypted a disk with the wrong key, getting garbage out.  He thinks that he
has solved the big problem and now has just one small problem left to solve.
However, the problem he has left to solve is in fact the exact same one he had
to start with: how to decrypt a bunch of data when you have no idea of the
key.  All he has done is decrypt a bunch of encrypted data with the wrong key.
Given that symmetrical encryption is a group, effectively he's randomised the
original key that was used to encrypt the data.  THIS is the take-home point:-
  ***** He still can't decrypt it without guessing (i.e. brute-forcing) an
encryption key the exact same size and strength as the original. *****   All your speculation is based on the assumption that the report is correct
and that therefore there must be an explanation of some sort why the problem
has occurred.  But the report is not correct, the problem has not occurred,
and therefore there is nothing to explain.

[  My maths isn't quite up to this.  Is it *necessarily* the case that /any/
polynomial of log N /necessarily/ grows slower than N?  If not, there's
nothing to discuss, because this is then a conventional compression scheme in
which some inputs lead to larger, not smaller, outputs.  Hmm.  It would seem
to me that if P(x)==e^(2x), P(log n) will grow exponentially faster than N.
I'm using log to mean natural log here, substitute 10 for e in that formula if
we're talking about log10, the base isn't important.  However, assuming that
we're only talking about P that *do* grow more slowly, I'll discuss the
problem with this theory anyway.  ]
  There are many, but there are no algorithms that can compress *all* large
numbers into small space; for all compression algorithms, some sets of input
data must result in *larger* output than input.
  There is *no* way round the sheer counting theory aspect of this.  There are
only 2^N unique files of N bits.  If you compress large files of M bits into
small files of N bits, and you decompression algorithm produces deterministic
output, then you can only possibly generate 2^N files from the compressed
  This theory has been advanced many times before.  The "Oh, if I can just
find the right parameters for a PRNG, maybe I can get it to reconstruct my
file as if by magic".  (Or subsitute FFT, or wavelet transform, or
key-expansion algorithm, or ... etc.)
  However, there are only as many unique generators as (2 to the power of the
number of bits it takes to specify your generator) in this scheme.  And that
is the maximum number of unique output files you can generate.
  There is ***NO*** way round the counting theory.
  I'm afraid to tell you that, as always, you will find the compression stage
easy.... and the decompression impossible.  There are many many many more
possible permutations of 1..N than the number of unique "short
representations" in the scheme.  There is no way that the smaller number of
"unique representations" can possibly produce any more than the same (smaller)
number of permutations once expanded.  There is no way to represent the other
(vast majority) of permutations.
  Then it's not really an algorithm, it's an ad-hoc collection of different
schemes.  If you're allowed to use a completely different encryption scheme
for every file, I can do better than that: for every file, define an
encryption scheme where the bit '1' stands for the content of that file, and
everything else is represented by a '0' bit followed by the file itself.
Sure, most files grow 1 bit bigger, but the only file we care about is
compressed to just a single bit!  Great!
  Unfortunately, all you've done is moved information around.  The amount of
information you'd have to have in the decompressor to know which file to
expand any particular '1' bit into is equal to .... the amount you've saved by
compressing the original to a single bit.
  There is ***NO*** way round the counting theory.
  I seriously advise you not to waste much time on it.  Because ...

Oh!
  Absolutely, absolutely!    A compression algorithm achieves the best results if it is designed with
statistical knowledge of the target domain taken into account.  In any
compression scheme you're balancing the set of inputs that grow smaller on
compression against the necessary counterpart of inputs that grow larger.
Whatever you gain in the first set, you lose in the second.  The secret is to
arrange that the inputs that tend to grow larger are the ones that are
less-common in real-world usage, and thus that the ones that are more common
tend to grow smaller.  In practice, this means eliminating 'redundancy', where
'redundancy' is defined as 'whatever similar properties you can tease out from
the more-common-real-world cases'.
  Of course, I could point out that there is precisely *1* bit of information
in that huge GIF, so even compressing it to 35 bytes isn't a great
achievement... it's one of the set of less-common inputs that grow bigger as a
compromise so that real pictures, which tend to have at least *some*
variation, grow smaller.

  Can anyone seriously imagine countries like Iran or China signing up to a
system that places complete control, surveillance and falsification
capabilities in the hands of the US' military intelligence?  I could see some
(but probably not even all) of the European nations accepting the move at face
value and believing whatever assurances of safeguards the DHS might offer, but
the rest of the world....?  No way.

next to useless.  As indeed the current situation provides evidence may be the
 Strawman.  Not what I said at all.
 FWIW, however, I would like to see them held by a multinational civilian
organisation.  That could be a UN or ITU body, or an ICANN or IETF/IANA
offshoot, there are many possibilities.
  The *important* point is that we have strategies and techniques available to
us in democracies to prevent corruption or abuse of power: we have separation
of powers, and bodies that bring together conflicting interests to share power
in the theory that if anyone tries to get up to anything, the others will be
watching, and since they have conflicting interests they are unlikely to
collude.  This seems to me to be a viable principle for management of internet
  Placing it all in the hands of a single interest group - whether that be the
US (or anybody else's) military, the RIAA, or Bun-Bun the mini-lop, is a
single point of failure for corruption/abuse resistance.
  BTW, there are lots of other reasons not to trust a military: lack of
accountability and oversight.  You were the first to mention democracy: just

Only if they get sent that particular forged DNS response.  It's more likely
to be targeted.  DHS man shows up at suspect's ISP, with a
signed-below-its-level dns record (or a whole hierarchy of normally signed
records) to install on just their servers and perhaps even to serve up to just
one of their customers.  Nobody else gets to see it.

  That's gotta stand out like a statistical sore thumb.
  The article is pretty poor if you ask me.  It outlines three techniques for
stealth: steganography, using a shared email account as a dead-letter box, and
blocking or redirecting known IP addresses from a mail server.  Then all of a
sudden, there's this conclusion ...
" Internet-based attacks are extremely popular with terrorist organizations
because they are relatively cheap to perform, offer a high degree of
anonymity, and can be tremendously effective. "

anything the rest of the article mentioned.  I would conclude that someone's
done ten minutes worth of web searching and dressed up a bunch of

optimise out calls to memset, not even thoroughly dead ones: for example -
 int foo (void);
int main (int argc, const char **argv)
  int var[100];
  memset (var, 0, sizeof var);
  foo ();

int foo (void)

  From "  How can I make sure that the firmware on my CryptoPhone is compiled form

We take a number of steps to ensure that you really get the correct firmware.
The source code repository for all CryptoPhones is held on a computer that
only our trusted developers can make changes to, and that is secured against
physical access. After the security review by outside experts, but before each
version of the firmware is released and used in the production of
CryptoPhones, the source is compiled by a number of security experts who then
publish the secure cryptographic SHA256-hash of the binary and of the source
it is compiled from.  "
  Of course, as anyone who's read "Reflections on trusting trust" knows, there
is no guarantee that the compiler actually genuinely compiles the source code
it is fed with and doesn't backdoor it or otherwise tamper with it!
  And in fact, they really need to release their circuit diagrams and parts
specs.  After all, just because you built your own code and downloaded it to
the phone, you have no guarantee that it really accepted the download into its

download-and-reflash code in the phone itself might have tampered with the
binary and backdoored it.
  If you wanted to be /really/ certain, I guess you'd have to take the tops

  Nor do I, but I'll have a go anyway.  Any errors are all my own work.  AIUI,
the weakness is that if you control one end of the DH exchange, you can force
a weak key to be selected for the subsequent encrypted exchange that an
external observer can easily guess.  I would summarize the main findings as:
  "If you are one participant in a DH key exchange, it is possible for you to
reveal the agreed-upon shared secret".
  "If you pwn an IKE server, you can decrypt and read all the traffic it is
exchanging with peers.  The clients of that server won't know that it's giving
up all their data".
  Whether you do it by forcing the implementation to choose a weak key, or by
just revealing the information that in each situation you already have under
your control, seems to me like a mere technicality.  I can't envisage any
situation under which this would actually *increase* your exposure.  However

an inline device and leave your normal ethernet NIC unplugged.  This is what
they refer to as "wired" operating mode, and given Steven's proviso about
controlling the firmware (and let's hope there's no holes or overflows in the
web admin interface either...) I think that this mode could just about be made
  The alternative, "wireless" mode, which was what initially I thought it did
all the time, does indeed rely on proxying your network traffic out over the
usb, then back to the main computer, then out over its own NIC - and that, of
course, can easily be bypassed.

  Oh, you can't specify them solely by key, you have to have all the

  IIRC various of the vendors' sshd updates released in the immediate wake

Thanks for doing this!
  Yes, to almost the exact same rate as sequential reads.  I'm guessing it
simply doesn't implement look-ahead decryption.  It might even be a positively
good idea to not decrypt anything until you're specifically asked.
  You think a 1GB/min encryption rate is so slow as to count as a "con"?  I
think that's fairly reasonable.  My lightly loaded AMD64x2 box just took 48s
to copy a 584MB file from one place to another on a first trial, and between
26s and 39s on 'hot' retests.
  Or are you suggesting that it could encrypt each block OTF when it's first
accessed, or run the encryption in the background while the system was still
live, instead of converting the whole drive in one big bite?

Not necessarily a problem, although it does depend on their design.  Even if
by saturating the chip in an intense EM field you can skew the result almost
all the way to 1 or 0, won't the standard debiassing trick of examining
successive pairs of bits handle that?
  The original paper on the clock skew identity tracking technique suggested
that naive randomisation doesn't help; adding a bit of randomisation just
introduces noise into your dataset, but you can still clearly see the slope of
the line they're clustered around.

Well, yes: it would be misleading to claim that end-to-end security protects
you against an insecure or hostile endpoint.  But it's a truism, and it's not
right to say that there is a security gap that is any part of the remit of
SSL/TLS to alleviate; the insecurity - the untrusted endpoint - is the same
regardless of whether you use end-to-end security or not.
  It's probably also not inaccurate to say that SSL/TLS protects you against
warrantless wiretapping; the warrantless wiretap program is implemented by
mass surveillance of backbone traffic, even AT+T doesn't actually forward the
traffic to their mail servers, decrypt it and then send it back to the tap
point - as far as we know.  When the spooks want your traffic as decrypted by
your ISP server, that's when they *do* go get a warrant, but the broad mass
warrantless wiretapping program is just that, and it'd done by sniffing the
traffic in the middle.  SSL/TLS *does* protect you against that, and the only
time it won't is if you're singled out for investigation.
  This is not to say that it wouldn't be possible for all ISPs to collaborate
with the TLAs to log, sniff or forward the decrypted traffic from their
servers, but if they can't even set up central tapping at a couple of core
transit sites of one ISP without someone spilling the beans, it seems
improbable that every ISP everywhere is sending them copies of all the traffic
from every server...

Out of curiosity, what kind of TCP are you guys using that has 8-bit
  Is it not also worth mentioning that TCP has some added degree of protection
in that if the ACK sequence num isn't right, the packet is likely to be
dropped (or just break the stream altogether by desynchronising the seqnums)?

I also disagree.  It's not like anyone says to themselves "Hey, this website

Hear hear!  This maxim should be burned into the frontal lobes of every

certainly they have far outnumbered the occasional flaws in core kernel

  Why are we wasting time even considering trying to break the public key?
  If this thing generates only a single "session" key (rather, a host key)
per machine, then why is it not trivial to break?  The actual encryption
algorithm used is RC4, so if they're using a constant key without a unique
IV per file, it should be trivial to reconstruct the keystream by XORing any
two large files that have been encrypted by the virus on the same machine.
  This thing ought to be as easy as WEP to break open, shouldn't it?

  According to this entry at viruslist.com:
which I found linked from the analyst's diary blog, "The virus uses Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0 (built into
Windows) to encrypt files. Files are encrypted using the RC4 algorithm. The
encryption key is then encrypted using an RSA public key 1024 bits in length
which is in the body of the virus."
  According to this thread on the gpcode forum:
the readme.txt files containing the ransom key are identical in every
directory on the infected computer, suggesting that there is indeed a unique
per-host RC4 key.
  According to every file encrypted by the virus grows by 8 bytes, so it looks like it uses
an IV.  But that didn't help with WEP...

it doesn't need any driver to be loaded and running, it just needs

I forget where it was that I recall a thread about this recently; could have
been here, could have been a security list, could even have been the comments
page of an ElReg or Slashdot article or a Schneier blog post ... ... but anyway, there was a thread somewhere recently the gist of which was:
   ''Disk erasing software is security theatre, because nobody has ever
actually done AFM recovery and it wouldn't be practical and it probably
wouldn't work on modern drives and nobody could ever afford it and it would
take years and generate terabytes of image data that you'd need a bank of
Crays to process and besides nobody has ever made a public claim of it having
been done, and all these data recovery firms say it's not an option and
nobody's ever actually done it.''
  Which is why I was brought up short in my tracks by this offhand, almost
throwaway couple of lines from a story a couple of days ago:
"  After getting a search warrant and confiscating his hard drive,
investigators were forced to scour through its remains using an electron
microscope, and the price of $100,000 per pass.  "
  The claim comes from "Robert Schperberg, forensics lead for Chevron, [ ...
]at the MIS Training Institute's IT Security World conference in San
Francisco", and is otherwise unverified.  I haven't been able to get hold of
any kind of transcript, so thus far it only has the status of "Something
someone said when giving a talk at a conference".
  It could easily be deliberate propaganda or misinformation, or it could just
be that the speaker was passing on something he'd heard but never checked up
  Does anyone here know anything about this case?  Or have *anything* solid
*at all* on firms or labs who do now or have ever in the past offered HD
recovery using scanning microscopy techniques?
