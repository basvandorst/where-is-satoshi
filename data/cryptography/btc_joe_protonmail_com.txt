The "I remember my first beer" response, can't say it was unexpected to be honest.
Fair enough. I actually don't disagree, it's basically just a combination of mostly old technologies. What we didn't have was the commercialization of hardware wallets which make it easy enough for the laymen to secure a private key without needing a masters in cryptography. We are moving into a world where everyone will need to learn how to do this in order to secure their bitcoin anyway, and now that is much easier.
What's wrong with resurrecting the spirit and ethos of the internet with a few new (post bitcoin) tools in our kit? What's old becomes new again : )

I would say it's pretty different for a bunch of reasons. For instance, I can't just go to Tom Mitchell's feed and check out his latest musings on life, or engage with them, or reshare them on my own feed. This is social media, less the monopolistic tech companies. A post on here can not trend or achieve virality, at least not in it of itself. I suppose these posts could be shared on social media to achieve such, but if Tom's post engages in 'wrong think' it could be shadow banned.
Further, I can't tip the post, and if I could I would need a paypal like entity to process the transaction. I mean, I could with bitcoin if you provided an address for it but that's a different conversation, in short, this system has different incentives which root the value of attention in hash power as opposed to traditional social media-like statistics. The units of account are in no way shape or form pretending to be, or competing with, global money. It's like reward points that have utility with a particular identity.
Also, with a system like this you wouldn't need a (password-based, vulnerable) account on 3-5 different walled garden platforms i.e. facebook, twitter, and youtube. Just one account, one identity for everything. All content easily referenced in the common language of public key crypto.
It depends which aspect of the system we are talking about here. In terms of what gets posted on your own block publishing server (sort of like your own feed) you are essentially the moderator. We begin with the assumption that a 'reply' is not worth your engagement, it is on you to share it or take it one step further and engage with it. Think of it like your twitter feed, except even more conservative in the sense that not every reply gets automatically posted.
In this system the content is, arguably, even more durable. That's sort of the point. On twitter, I am granted permission to post on their platform, at any point in time my content can be 'cancelled' and all record of it lost. Now, of course I do have the option to back up that content before that happens if I am smart, but permission to publish can easily be taken away if I piss off the wrong person. On the TSN, you begin by storing your own data (given you are willing to run a BPS), if you can attract others to run a node of your identity chain, cloutchain, and mine--it becomes increasingly redundant.
With that said, if you don't want to run a server, you can use a Lightweight Address, a different trade-off. Here your content is basically evaluated on it's own merits. If you can provoke interaction/engagement then your content can potentially be stored in another record. Or you can pay a bit of 'clout' to have it shared on a Server Feed (I think this would be more popular with videos and such, sort of like a youtube, but without the need for an account and password). While that stuff would likely have a non-zero cost, it allows for exposure to tipping in the clout of the server feed.

Also, it's important to note that publishing content entirely depends upon the ability to securely store a private key, which again I strongly believe will be a necessity of the world we are moving into. If you lose this key you lose your identity on the system. This is admittedly a big task, but if the laymen can not achieve this level of technical competence, they will not be able to self custody any significant amount of wealth in bitcoin. On the plus side of things, there is now literally a whole industry dedicated to making this task easy with hardware wallets, etc. My assumption in all of this is that problem has and will continue to be solved regardless of the existence of a decentralized social network.
All of the above is separate from the issue of storing/backing up your own content (standard practice for a website). If you just want to view content none of that is needed of course. Lightweight Addresses are sort of the middle-ground (no server needed).

============================== START ==============================
I?ve been working on a new system for engaging in decentralized social media using an open-source protocol.
The paper is available at: Some context:
You can find a very raw proof of concept of the idea at my other site [ Take it with a grain of salt, much of what?s in the paper was worked out in recent weeks/months, and will require a lot of work to implement (thus why I figured I would share and hopefully raise some intellectual capital). A little over a year ago the idea began as a way to prove ownership of various traditional social media accounts from my personal website. Then it evolved into how I could tailor content from my site in a manner similar to social media using digital signatures. Then I realized I had to incorporate a way to enable interactions. Then I realized I needed timestamps and some type of protocol. And eventually the goal became to not only enable decentralized social media, but further, to enable the creation of historical records. There are also some potentially huge ideas that could be created on top of this thing.
Abstract: A decentralized social network would allow participants to engage in social media directly without relying on trusted third parties. The need for permission-based access to various walled garden platforms would be eliminated. Recreating the vast majority of social media functionality largely depends upon solving the problem of decentralized, pseudonymous identity. We propose a solution to the above by utilizing the cryptocurrency Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). By choosing a single public address, participants can create censorship-resistant historical records of content. Content is provably linked to an identity through the creation of digital fingerprints, which are timestamped and committed to blocks (which are themselves timestamped). Participants can reference their own and others content by simply including it?s unique fingerprint within their message. Any file that can be hashed (audio, video, zips, pdfs, etc) can be included within messages. While files themselves are not stored in these identity blockchains, a record of them is, as their hashes are committed to fingerprints.
