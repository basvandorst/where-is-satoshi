The U.S. taxpayer is getting screwed with their own money. Again.
I am also impressed at the level of effort here. I did not think we would
be "here" -- figuratively speaking -- when everyone was calling Dorothy
Denning the "Wicked Witch of the East" for her support of key escrow back
in the early 90's on the cypherpunk list (I have not been on that list in
many years).
In any event -- and please don't take this the wrong way -- it is almost as
sickening to me as someone telling a rape victim to sit back and enjoy the
ride, or that they should admire their rapist for their technique and
I won't make any ham-handed comparisons to GOP candidates in 2011. :-)
Seriously, the breadth & depth of how the NSA and the U.S. Intelligence
Community has damaged trust in the post-9/11 Internet world is sick &
twisted in the most grotesque way imaginable.
It is not to be respected or admired in any way whatsoever. They have
undermined everything we have been trying to do on the Internet in the name
of safety and security for 20+ years.
Apologies for the short rant, but I *do* have some optimism for 2014 and
beyond. :-)

The real "in the middle" threat these days is credential-stealing
Man-in-the-Browser (MitB) malware, such as most modern day banking
Trojans (ZeuS, et al).
This is truly "in the middle" insofar as the attacker is actively and
surreptitiously part of the end-to-end session.

Okay, so you got me on a technicality. :-)
So I figured I would bring that up, especially since I see the IETF
security area completely disconnected from reality with regards to
security operations.
I used to be -- back in the inglorious 90's, when I was a cisco
engineer -- very active in the IETF. Even have my name attached to a
couple of RFCs, BCP38 being the most recognizable. I stopped
participating in the IETF around ~1999-2000 when I started working on
security issues "full time" after realizing that most of the IETF
constabulary had no real idea of what "security" on the Internet
actually involved from an operations perspective.
Encryption does not security make.
Sure, encryption is a good thing, when designed & implemented
correctly, but if the end systems are compromised (Welcome to my
world!) then you are simply provide a secure transit mechanism for
criminals to conduct their... crimes, given that they have control of
the end system with "great security".
It's a Tao thing. :-)

Apologies for top-posting, but wanted to maintain context here.
One additional issue here -- and there are *many* examples of this -- bothers me greatly, and that is that the U.S. does *not* appear to be a country where the "law" is applied evenly. Some people in government (and elsewhere) seem to be above the law.
Some people get prosecuted at the maximum extent of the law, yet others never get charged for their obvious & public violations of the law (even publicly suborning perjury by outright lying to congressional committees).
I am also very disturbed at the U.S. DoJ machinations in the past couple of years which indicate they are willing to go after anyone who exposes the secret violations of law by members (or agancies) of of the U.S. Government by threatening journalists with legal prosecutions, as well as intelligence operations targeted at journalists.
These are not activities of a functional and thriving democracy.

One small contribution to this discussion, although somewhat adjunct, is
that browsers can be made much "more armored" or resistant to
exploitation with only a simple plug-in (or two).
For example, my Firefox 24.2.0 + NoScript 2.6.8.10 is *much* more
resistant to almost any in-browser exploitation, when properly
configured and used. But there's the rub. It ain't for everyone.
Having said that, what we are talking about here is the fact that it
should *not* take an advanced operational knowledge of technology to be
able to use it. Even the most advanced technology has to be usable.
It has to be usable for everyone. Usable, plug-in encryption can also be
that way.

And also very interesting opinion (apropos?) as to where we are as a
society right now in the evolution of the Internet, a crossroads where
our daily personal & professional lives meet:
"If you think the Internet can go on being just like it is, here's
some bad news."
"...the Internet might soon look less like 1970s New York and more
like 1990s Mogadishu: warring factions destroying the most fundamental

and security costs making it prohibitive for anyone but the most
well-funded operations to do business without becoming a 'soft target'
for political or economic gain."
