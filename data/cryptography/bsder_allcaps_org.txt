@_subject: [Cryptography] PAKE for embedded device (<64K RAM)? 
I've been trying to secure some BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) communication, but seem to have hit into a wall in trying to avoid active MITM attacks.
Is there a good PAKE anywhere for small devices?  It seems like all the PAKE protocols use very heavyweight primitives and don't like elliptic curve stuff very much.
Maybe I'm just being obtuse and not searching on the right keywords, but it seems like *everything* in this space is a bit flaky--either theoretically or implementation-wise.  It doesn't seem like there has been much auditing going on in this space.
It seems like IEEE 802.15.6 was supposed to cover this, but it seems like that got compromised:
ProtonMail has a discussion about SRP here:
But it certainly makes me wary when I, as an implementer, seem to have to make so many decisions about the underlying protocol(Hash function, different moduli, embedded in certificate-TLS (then why use SRP?), prime number choice, etc.).  Since I am most definitively *NOT* a cryptographer, I'm incredibly likely to screw something up. SRP isn't exactly *small* either.
Normally, my first instinct is to go look at what DJB has to say and then work outward from there, but I'm not seeing anything in this space.
Am I missing something?  What's the current "best practice" in this space?
Any pointers would be appreciated.

I'm not sure I buy this completely.  Things like SRP require a not insignificant chunk of OpenSSL, and that takes up a pretty big chunk of a 256K ROM/64K RAM device.  None of the embedded crypto stacks seem to implement SRP.
Motivated active hacker, but not necessarily state level threat actors.  Bunnie Huang, not NSA.  :)  So, capable of dumping a ROM to get keys, possibly decapping a chip while destroying it, getting a discarded device from the trash with which to create correct keys in the middle.
No, not particularly.  We have rate limiting that should prevent DoS from originating.  Receiving will simply shut down when on a battery powered device.  It is more important that attackers not be able to command the device than the user have access.  Think lighting--you probably don't command the device all that often--so it's more likely that you won't even notice a DoS attack as long as you aren't originating.  In addition, there are so many ways to DoS BLE that defending against yet one more doesn't make a lot of sense.
Yes and yes.  We are assuming that someone can pick up a discarded chip and carry on two valid conversations while sitting in the middle.  BLE requires some level of physical proximity, and we dial the power back.  But we're being careful.  We'd like not to wind up in the newspapers for being the next big botnet...
We do have the ability to enter a pin code.

Okay, now *THAT* got my attention.
How?? How does she cut masks?? How does she diffuse implants?
Information please?
