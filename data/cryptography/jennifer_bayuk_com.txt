system.  the amount insecure From: line 12 year old it should be have started Though John's January 30th note was about Zoemail, I am reacting to the
words "PGP still isn't widespread" in Sascha's post about PGP. I also was
once under the assumption that I should always have PGP installed. I was
able to verify signatures, and I thought that one day, most people would
gravitate to PGP in some form. However, losing a fight with PGP Support over
whether the enterprise plug-ins I was requesting for a corporation would
reduce the security level of their product (long story about trying to
integrate it with single sign on), and also spending many hours over three
months trying to install the commercial version on Vista, only to have the
PGP engineers tell me that I would have to uninstall all my other Outlook
plug-ins for them to continue working on the problem (e.g. card scanner), I
realize that it will never be the solution of choice for either commercial
enterprise or home office given its current support model. I have not used
it since July and have not missed it a bit.

books are even better.
Anderson's "Security Engineering" at the top of the list:
Catching up on this discussion late, but having spent significant time
reviewing security engineering textbooks, I will chime in on that topic.
Admittedly, there are far too few, but two noteworthy endeavors are:
Sherwood, J., A. Clark, and D. Lynas, Enterprise Security Architecture.
2005: CMP Books.
Jacobs, S., Engineering Information Security. 2011: Wiley.
While I did not sufficiently appreciate the Sherwood, Lynas and Clark book
until it unfortunately went out of print, its common-sense wisdom keeps
sending me back to quote it.
While Jacobs book is less entertaining than Anderson's, its technical
content surpasses it.

I am not sure you would know regardless. I have an account, for the same reason I have a Facebook account, so no one else would have my identity on the site. I don't recall when I last logged in, but just now using that link, I got this message:
" No activity.

Actually, MongoDB native is BSON, not JSON.   BSON has a more native types
(datetime, int32, int64, decimal, binary) and requires only
encoding/decoding -- no whitespace parsing; its first four byte contain
total byte size to allow for memory allocation and/or size thresholds for a
comparison, so it is potentially useful in this context, and I have seen
round-trip hashing success with it, see:

@_subject: [Cryptography] How Google's Physical Keys Will Protect Your 
I administer a small Gsuite domain and purchased a key from Yubico (for $50 instead of the $20 reported in the article, because it had NFC and I thought it might work with my iphone - it doesn't). It seems to work just like any other hard token that can be reduced to a soft token. As the Times points out, it only works with Google apps, and I did not see an option to use it with OAUTH. It is also just one type of second step in a more holistic "two-step verification feature" that a user turns on.
In practice, Gsuite did not require identify verification often, I enabled it a few months ago and it seems I only get asked to plug in my key when I am on a new device or clear my cache. Not even after reboot. If I don't have it handy, I can tell it to send me a text instead. I suppose it may time out or have some suspicious meter, but I don't see a setting that is configurable. Google also allows end users to generate emergency keys and save them to desktops, and these emergency keys (5 at a time) can be used in place of the token. IMHO, this feature puts a just little too much trust in end user behavior.
The administrative settings for two-step verification are: "on", "on but not enforced", and "off". So you can leave it up to users if they want to use it or not. This is a feature. I do not see a way to enforce the hard token over the cell phone or emergency authentication methods. My guess is that they are still refining how they think it should work.

Actually, banks do lose track of customers, and rely primarily on snailmail. You cannot legally open a bank account without a physical address (in US). There used to be a way customers could have banks hold all physical mail, but Anti-Money-Laundering requirements pretty much ended that practice. As the SSN is used to check credit, although a bank may take a deposit without SSN, they would have major difficulty making a loan without one. It is the common index for a customer across the banking system and would likely end up being replaced with another string.

POC code would be great - advance thanks - I spent an hour on it yesterday but had to set it aside.
And sincere appreciation to all who contributed feedback!
