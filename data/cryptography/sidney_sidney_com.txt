@_subject: Thermal Imaging Decision Applicable to TEMPEST? 
IANAL, but when I read the decision it seemed to apply to new
technologies that are equivalent to entering someone's house and looking
around without a search warrant. Looking ahead, it may someday be
possible to make the walls of someone's home effectively transparent,
and the ruling says it is illegal to use such technology in situations
where it would be illegal to enter the house.
There's an article by someone who is a lawyer at
where he defines the question in this case as
"Is thermal imaging more like going through your garbage (which courts
have allowed) or more like looking into your window with a high-powered
telescope (for which courts generally require a warrant)?"
The article goes on about the decision process in cases like this.
I think it is clear that a Supreme Court judge might consider technology
to effectively look through walls to see whatever is there as being in a
different class than technology to remotely detect the details of use of
electronic equipment, in the same way that a telescope looking in the
window is different from sifting through garbage.

A little over a month ago Perry Metzger asked about free assembler
language implementations of Rijndael for x86. Helger Lipmaa, whose
commercial assembler language version seems to be the fastest,
mentioned Brian Gladman as having the best free C implementation.
Gladman's web page now says that he has a free assembler language
version. For comparison, Lipmaa says that his runs at 230 cycles per
block, Gladman's C version runs at 360 cycles per block, and Gladman's
assembler language version runs at 300 cycles/block. It is not yet a
complete implementation. Here's a quote from the website:
"Here is a preliminary version of this code in assembler for the
Pentium family with MMX (Pentium II/III/IV). This only implements the
standard block size of 128 bits but is 15-20% faster than the C code.
It achieves a maximum speed with a fully primed processor cache of
about 300 cycles/block, which is around 50 Mbytes/second on a 1GHz
processor.  This version has not been extensively tested so please be
aware that there may be bugs in it. Note also that it uses the
Microsoft VC++ register saving conventions and may hence need changes

Based on the comments on slashdot it appears that Niels Provos, whose program found no steganography in millions of images on the web, was able to detect and decode an example image planted by ABC as part of their documentary on steganography and mentioned b ythem on the air. The example was a picture hidden mixed in to another picture revealed using the password 'ABC'.

@_subject: Why is RMAC resistant to birthday attacks? 
"bear"  asked:
It doesn't. As described in the paper all you can do with it is the following:
Mallory discovers that a message from Alice "Buy a carton of milk" and another
message from Alice "Get a dozen eggs" are sent with the same salt and have the
same MAC, and guesses correctly that Alice and Bob are using RMAC and the two
messages use the same keys. He then notices a message from Alice with the same
salt as the others "Buy a carton of milk and send Mallory a million dollars".
That allows Mallory to forge a message that says "Get a dozen eggs and send
Mallory a million dollars".
The mention of the birthday surprise in the paper is in the section on message
extension forgery attack, which is the arttack described above. Where the
birthday surprise comes in is in computing the work factor for performing that
attack. In the case of RMAC it is two to the power (k+r)/2, and that's how
many messages from Alice that all use the same keys Mallory will, on the
average, have to snoop before an opportunity for such an attack crops up,
i.e., the MAC is the same (k bits) and the salt is the same (r bits). The salt
does add r/2 bits to the work factor compared to just using a k bit hash for
the MAC without a salt.
It is left as an exercise for the reader to come up with an application for
RMAC in which one would have a chance to snoop 2^((k+r)/2) messages that all
use the same keys to find one colliding pair, and then in which Alice would
send another message that is the first one of that pair extended with
something and which happens to have the same salt as the first one (about
1/2^r probability), and in which the second colliding message extended with
the same things as the first would have some meaning that would create a
damaging result.
But whether or not this is a likely problem, the paper does compute the work
factor of the attack so you can make a decision on key and salt sizes to make
it infeasible given the circumstances of your use of RMAC.

Ed Gerck" Well, to be really pedantic the paper never says that it is "easy" only that
it has a work factor of the square root of the number of possible MAC strings
without salt, and that adding the salt multiplies that by the square root of
the possible number of salt values. That attack scenario certainly doesn't
look easy to me :-). And as long as I'm being pedantic I'll point out my own

I just realized something about the salt in the RMAC algorithm, although it
may have been obvious to everyone else:
RMAC is equivalent to a HMAC hash-based MAC algorithm, but using a block
cipher. The paper states that it is for use instead of HMAC iin circumstances
where for some reason it is easier to use a block cipher than a cryptographic
The security of HMAC against attacks based on collisions is measured as a
function of the bit length of the hash. Using a block cipher in CBC mode makes
it in effect a b bit hash, where b is the block length of the cipher. In many
cases the block length of a cipher being 64 or 128 bits will be too small by
itself. Hence the need to add r bits from the salt and the need to write up
explicitly how RMAC handles collision based attacks and how the salt affects

Ed Gerck"  said:
Some quotes from the paper:
"This paper defines an authentication mode of operation, called RMAC, for a
symmetric key block cipher algorithm"
The definition of RMAC in the table of defnintions: "The name of the
authentication mode that is specified in this Recommendation"
"In particular, RMAC is an algorithm for generating a message authentication
code (MAC) from the data to be authenticated and from an associated value
called a salt, using a block cipher and two secret keys [...]"
"Fips Pub 198 specified a different MAC algorithm, called HMAC, that is also
appropriate for protection of sensitive data. Because HMAC is constructed from
a hash function rather than a block cipher algorithm, RMAC may be preferable
for application environments in which an approved block cipher is more
convenient to implement than an approved hash function."
RMAC was devised for the reason I stated, as it says in the last quote from
the paper above. The salt is there to make the cost of the extension forgery
attack more expensive because the birthday surprise shows that just the number
of bits in the cipher block may not make it expensive enough without a salt.
The key size is not relevant to the "birthday attack" (actually extension
forgery attack) as shown in the table where the work factor expressed as a
function of the block length and the salt length, not the key size.

@_subject: comparing RMAC to AES+CBC-MAC or XCBC (Re: Why is RMAC resistant to birthday attacks?) 
No, because it is not a collision for the purpose of this attack on this
algorithm unless the b bit untruncated MAC and the r bit salt both match, even
if the m bit truncated MAC matches. As it says in the paper:
"the unauthorized party would have to collect 2^((b+r)/2) message-tag pairs in
order to expect to detect a collision"
That's because the collision is only of use for the extension forgery attack
if the two colliding messages have the property that RMAC(x) == RMAC(y) and
RMAC(x||z) == RMAC(y||z) which is only true for a collision of the full b bit
untruncated MAC and the r bit salts are the same..
I think that they are chosen to make the work factors for General Forgery and
Extension Forgery attacks about the same in any one parameter set. It would
not make sense to have a parameter set which was a lot weaker to one of the
attacks than to the other. Look at Table 2 to see that is so.

[... quote snipped ...]
This doesn't contain the paragraph that you quoted, though a Google search found it
which appears to be the complete version of the same presentation.
In any case, I don't see any mention of extension forgery attacks in either the
portion you quoted nor elsewhere in the paper. There isn't reason to mention it since
XCBC should be inherently resistant to extension forgery attacks. The attack requires
that the MAC have the property that MAC(x) == MAC(y) implies that MAC(x||z) ==
MAC(y||z). In the case of XCBC, because of the padding and the use of K2 and K3 that
would only be true when x and y are the same length or both have lengths that are
multiples of the cipher block size.
I agree with your conclusion, but I don't see how anything Rogaway says about XCBC
has anything to do with it.
In the case of RMAC, if the parameter sets were chosen to make the work factors
comparable on the two attacks, I think it is making the mistake of comparing apples
and oranges: In the exhaustive key search attack, the attackers captures one message
and the work factor is multiplied times the time it takes to try a key on their own
computers. In the extension forgery attack the work factor is multiplied by the time
between captured messages. The latter is somewhat under the control of the person who
is using RMAC. There is no reason to require that they have similar work factors if
the scale is much different.
It was just my supposition that equality of the work factors was the motivation
behind selecting those parameter sets. I would like to see another reason or a
pointer to an explanation by the author if there is one.

@_subject: unforgeable optical tokens? 
The section on replay attacks in Pappu's PhD thesis only addresses what an
adversary could do given some free access to the device, presumably for a
finite time after which the device is returned to the owner. Pappu
demonstrates that it is not feasible to extract and store sufficient
information to either have all possible challenge/response pairs available
or to be able to compute them with a simulation.
That does not address the issue that the challenger also does not have
access to the full range of challenge/respones, and so has to keep a
feasibly small number of them as secrets. This is more secure than a shared
secret, because the token owner does not need to know which challenges the
challenger has stored, so an adversary can only obtain them from the
challenger. If the same challenge/response pair is given to two challengers,
then either one could forge authentication of the identity of the token's
owner. On the other hand there are so many possible challenge/response pairs
that there is no need to give the same ones to two people. In fact Pappu
describes a protocol in which challenge/response pairs are never reused. It
means that challengers can believe the authentication to the degree that
they believe that they have kept their copy of the challenge/response pairs
secure and that the token is in the physical possession of the right person
at the time the challenge/response is exchanged.
Pappu characterizes the device as a "physical one-way hash function". Given
a random challenge that is not known in advance, producing the proper
response proves that one has posession of a particular physical token. It
does not break security to lend the token to someone so that they can store
a bunch of challenge/response pairs for future use in having you
authenticate yourself to them.
Figuring out how to use this for digital signatures or asymmetric encryption
looks like a challenge: Unlike algorithmic one-way hash functions, the only
way to compute the function is to have physical posession of the device: Bob
does not get to confirm Alice's result unless the protocol involves Alice
lending or giving Bob her token. Pappu's example of a bit commitment
protocol (page 128 of his thesis) involves Alice picking a random token from
a pile and handing it to Bob.
The thesis has a section on digital signatures, but all that does is
describe how algorithmic one way hash functions are used to sign messages,
not how the physical one-way hash function could be used for that. Since the
only way to compute the hash is to have physical access to the device,
verification of a signature would require one to be able to submit a
challenge to the device and read back the response. This brings up all sorts
of questions such as how the challenger verifies that the device is the
correct signing token and is functioning properly, as well as how to prevent
the challenger from using their temporary access to the device to generate a
signature for any message they wish. Whether or not this device can be used
for digital signatures, how to do it is never addressed in the thesis.

No, it implies a service that your outgoing mail server makes available that has you authenticate to it in some way and then signs your mail in some way.
The article doesn't make clear exactly how it would work. The signature might just certify that the mail really was sent through the mail server that the headers claim was used. That would allow you to use any email address that you want, such as your acm.org address, and the signature certifies that you authenticated yourself with the SMTP server.
My ISP recently switched to using TLS SMTP/Auth for access to their SMTP server from outside their network for their customers. It would be easy and useful for them to stamp mail that I send to show that it really was sent through their SMTP server and that they know who I am.
This might not be exactly the same as what Yahoo! is talking about: They might be thinking only about mail with a yahoo.com From address being sent through a yahoo.com server and being signed with a key associated with the yahoo.com domain. But if the signature is taken to authenticate the domain of the SMTP server in the initial Received header, then it is possible to maintain lists of servers of ISPs who are trusted to authenticate users of their SMTP servers and to have anti-spam policies, and blacklists of servers that are spam sources. The From address would be irrelevant.

I agree. Even time period and message content aren't good enough: Let's say that the outgoing SMTP mailer at example.com is trusted. Spammer gets an account at example.com, sends themselves one message, then immediately copies the signature into forged headers for their spam that is sent out through whatever open relays or compromised machines they are using. The only way that the mail can be trusted is if it is being received directly from the example.com SMTP server. If there is any relaying, there is nothing that remains true and constant to sign.
But that is the situation we have today: My ISP's server can choose to refuse to accept connections from servers that are on a blacklist of open relays and spammers, and can, in theory, have a list of known good servers who authenticate their clients. If all the new header does is verify the sending mail server, that is done just as well by verifying the ip address at the time of connection.

2.4.  Shortcomings of cryptographical approaches
  At a first glance, the problem of sender address forgery might
  appear to be solvable with cryptographic methods such as challenge
  response authentications or digital signatures. A deeper analysis
  shows that only a small, closed user group could be covered with
  cryptographical methods. Any method used to stop spam forgery must
  be suitable to detect forgery not only for a small number of
  particular addresses, but for all addresses on the world. An
  attacker does not need to know the secrets belonging to a
  particular address. It is sufficient to be able to forge any
  address and thus to know any secret key. Since there are several
  hundreds of millions of users, there will always be a large amount
  of compromised keys, thus spoiling any common cryptographic method.
  Furthermore, cryptography has proven to be far too complicated and
  error prone to be commonly administered and reliably implemented.
  Many e-mail and DNS administrators do not have the knowledge
  required to deal with cryptographic mechanisms. Many legislations
  do not allow the general deployment of cryptography and a directory
  service with public keys. For these reasons, cryptography is
  applicable only to a small and closed group of users, but not to
  all participants of the e-mail service.

A clear summary of some voting protocols including the use of ANDOS for voting with one central facility can be found at
If you compare the protocol that uses ANDOS with the one that uses two central facilities and avoids the complications of ANDOS, it may become clear just what is the point of the identification number I which is distributed using ANDOS. That number is linked to the identity of the voter. The problem being addressed is how to allow someone to vote while preserving the anonymity of their vote, i.e., without recording their real-world ID with the vote. ANDOS allows a central facility to distribute unique ID numbers without knowing who gets what ID. The second protocol simplifies the problem by allowing one central facility to know who got what ID and the second facility to know the vote cast by each ID, but anonymity depends on trusting the two facilities not to Where this relates to your question is that nothing in the protocols has anything to do with the problem of physically identifying the voter and certifying that individual's right to vote. That is outside the cryptographic protocol. Step 1 of the ANDOS version is publishing a list of eligible voters. That implies that there are individual identities, that some are eligible to vote, and that they can be identified. In Step 2 each voter submits an intention to vote. This step implies some way for each voter to authenticate as being one of the identities on the list. Whether it is through biometrics or fear of legal sanctions or naive trust of all the voters is up to the people setting up the voting procedures. It is only after the identity has been verified and an ID number assigned that the rest of the protocol comes into play to allow exactly one vote per ID and to preserve the privacy of the voter.

No, 75 million. If you look at my message again I did correctly say 750,000
for the 1% false positive figure, although I did not type a comma to make it
easier to read.
True, but to a first approximation most of the 200,000 average passengers
per day in ATL will be unique individuals, so the false positive rate over
the entire population is a good indicator of the effect of deploying the
system in an airport. In any case, unless the individuals who repeatedly are
falsely matched against the database stop travelling, they would increase
the overall false postive rate by the same amount that repeat passengers who
are not falsely matched decrease the overall rate.
The more important number in these trials to ask about is the size of the
database. A 1% false positive rate on a large population matched against a
database of 5 faces is much worse than the same rate against a database of
500000. The article mentioned a watch list size of 3000, which seems like a
reasonable size for comparison, but the article implies that there were
different trials conducted for the study. Without referring to the original
report I can't tell if the 1% FP rate was based on that trial or one with a
different size database.
Taking into account the imprecision inherent in a news article reporting on
a large study, all it is safe to say is that when it says "only one subject
in a 100" the article is saying "only" while presenting a really horrific
scenario for the airport security people if this system is used to screen
all the passengers.

The Massachusetts law defines as a crime:

(ii) to conceal or to assist another to conceal from any communication

(5)  Assist others in committing any of the acts prohibited by this section.
And it also says under civil actions:
(1) Any person aggrieved by a violation of this section may bring a civil
action in any court of competent jurisdiction.  "Any person aggrieved" shall
include any communication service provider

This does seem broad enough to be used in situations other than outright
fraud against an ISP or communications company. There is language about
"intent to defraud" in Section 1 but the language in Section 2 (b)(1) about
possession, use, manufacture, etc., would seem to have the same kind of
broadness we have seen misused in the DMCA, covering people who sell NAT and
encryption tools that might be used by someone who sends email while
attempting to defraud a communications service provider.

If you quantify the "practically negligible" risk, it might be less irksome: SHA-1 is a 160 bit hash. The birthday paradox says that you would need to hash 2^80 different credit card numbers before you had a 50% probability of having even one collision in your database keys. Very roughly that means you would need to have a trillion different credit card numbers in your database in order to get as much as a one in a trillion chance of a collision. You would probably find dealing with a trillion different credit card numbers more irksome than the negligible chance of a collision even that many would give you.

Looking at the article and the links that were posted here,
1. It appears that the defense won only because the prosecution did not come
up with an expert to refute the defense expert. He could have argued based
on Goedel's Theorem or the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the case
would have gone the same way.
2. "The NRMA has called for a full audit of the way the state's 110
enforcement cameras are used ..." Note that NRMA is a motorist association,
like the AAA in the US. This is not a government body nor anyone with
authority calling for an audit.
3. The expert may not have outright lied by saying that the MD5 collision
result "theoretically" means that RTA could change the speed without
changing the hash, but his definition of "theoretically" has to include
"leaving it in the realm of theory by not trying to think the problem
through". This is not a situation where you can throw some random looking
bits in to make the hash come out right. Actually reading the article again
I don't see it made explicit that the person quoted was the expert used by
the defense or if he is just someone the reporter went to for a comment on
the story. For all we know the defense lawyer made the claim that "People
have shown it [MD5] has been hacked and it's open to viruses," and without a
prosecution rebuttal that was enough.
4. The marketing speak that Aram linked to is not all that bad for marketing
people making a hash of technical jargon they have been given. My assumption
is that they sign the time, date, place, numberplate and speed record using
RSA/MD5. Trying to explain that to a non-techie and they will hear the words
public key, encryption, and MD5 hash, so it is not unreasonable for them to
write "public key authenticated using MD5 encryption to ensure information
is authentic and tamper free".
5. Back to point  the attack on MD5 doesn't seem to cast doubt on the
signed data from the speed camera, as long as one can trust that the private
key is safely hidden in the camera. As Aram pointed out it is easy to show
that no possible speed, time and date will hash with the same numberplate to
get the same value.

Ok, I did misunderstand you. If that "failed 120-130 times" is talking about
the number of trials between primes, then you are getting within the range of
expected results.
According to the prime number theorem, the probability of selecting a prime
number at random from odd numbers is about 2/ln(n) which for a 512 bit number
is about 1 in 177, which means you have about a 50% chance of 120 tries before
finding a prime.
According to the results that Anton quoted there is a 2^56 chance that a 512
bit odd number that passes one round of Miller-Rabin is actually prime.
So all of your results do make sense.

@_subject: crypto for the average programmer 
One set of comparisons of OpenSSL 0.9.7d and GMP RSA speed from last March was
posted on the GMP discussion mailing list by the GMP developer at
The less than surprising result is that if one of the packages has optimized
assembler language Bignum routines for a platform and the other doesn't, then
the package with the assembler routines is faster.
A few years ago I found that it was not worth the overhead of a JNI call to
have a Java program call out to the OpenSSL library instead of using the java
BigNum class which is written in Java. At the time I thought I was testing the
effect of JNI overhead, assuming that the C implementation of BigNum in OpenSSL
was of course much faster than one in Java.
I revisited the question sometime in the last six months and was surprised to
find that the JNI calls to OpenSSL were now much faster. It was not a matter of
JNI overhead being large, but that OpenSSL bignum arithmetic had been slow.
Looking into it I found some discussion of how GMP bignum was much faster than
OpenSSL and subsequent revision of the OpenSSL code on the x86 platform. I'm
pretty sure I did these later tests with a newer version of OpenSSL than 0.9.7d
and the x86 performance was about equal to that of GMP, as opposed to GMP being
2.5 to 3 times faster in the March tests.
Recently OpenSSL added a GMP engine to allow GMP to be used for Bignum
arithmetic on platforms where GMP is faster than the OpenSSL library.
Based on the final sentence of the posting to gmp-discuss linked to above, I
would predict that there will continue to be a version race between the two
packages until they both reach some limit of performance, at least on platforms
 on which the OpenSSL developers want to maintain parity, letting the other
platforms be serviced by the GMP engine.

"security advisory". The word "advisory" led to me to think, "Aha,

least they are going to warn me that this is not really secure and if I
want to prevent any phishing attack I should do something like click on
the login button without entering my information, then actually enter on
the secured site".
Nope. Hovering the mouse over the icon tells me that they secure their
transactions using 128-bit SSL and I can get more information by
clicking on the icon. Clicking it brings up a page saying... Yes, the
same pod people wrote their web site:
"Online Security Policy

Excerpt from
"NSA has determined that beyond the 1024-bit public key cryptography in
common use today, rather than increase key sizes beyond 1024-bits, a
switch to elliptic curve technology is warranted. In order to facilitate
adoption of Suite B by industry, NSA has licensed the rights to 26
patents held by Certicom Inc. covering a variety of elliptic curve
technology. Under the license, NSA has a right to sublicense vendors
building equipment or components in support of US national security
Does this prevent free software interoperability with Suite B standards?
It potentially could be used to block non-US vendors, certainly anyone
who is in the US Government's disfavor, but it seems to me that even
with no further intentional action by the NSA it would preclude software
under the GPL and maybe FOSS in general in countries in which the
patents are valid.

Because the NSA's assurances that their license would cover open source
software is probably good enough to allow you to write and contribute
code to a non-GPL open source project if they do not have specific rules
against accepting patent-encumbered code, but the GPL has these two
sections regarding patents. I interpret them as meaning that the only
patent restriction there may be on GPL'd code is that it may not be
distributed in certain countries, but _any_ other restriction makes the
code not distributable under GPL.
[begin quote]
7.  If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
by public license practices. Many people have made generous
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
a consequence of the rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
limitation as if written in the body of this License.

@_subject: NSA Suite B Cryptography 
If you wrote a Suite B program and distributed it under a BSD license
after getting a sub-license for the patent from the NSA, presumably I
could take that code, modify it, and then in order to use or distribute
 my modified code I would have to obtain my own sublicense from the NSA.
I could do that as long as I met whatever criteria the NSA has for
granting sublicenses. My guess is that at a minimum the program would
have to be available for free or for sale to the US government for some
purpose that allows it to be considered as being "in support of US
national security interests."
It would make no sense for the NSA to grant a sublicense to you that
allowed to you grant me a license to produce possibly proprietary code
that infringes the patent and is not in support of US national security
So, yes, under those assumptions BSD-like licenses would not be
excluded, with the understanding that in addition to the copyright terms
allowing free use of the code there would also be patent restrictions
affecting the use.
As you say, the NSA's solution to their problem has nothing to do with
FOSS, and it doesn't specifically exclude FOSS. But it will preclude GPL
software that will interoperate with Suite B from being distributed in
countries that recognize the patents.
Unless, I suppose the NSA is able to say that any use of the patent in
open source software can be considered "in support of US national
security interests" and therefore the sublicense can be propagated as
long as the source remains available. In other words, if they include a
GPL-like provision that the patent license will stay with the code as
long as it is distributed under GPL. That would be an interesting twist.

@_subject: NSA Suite B Cryptography 
Poor phrasing on my part. Exactly as you said, the patent sublicense
cannot be passed on even if the code is released under, say a BSD
copyright license. People would have a right to copy the source code but
would have to obtain patent rights either from the NSA if they are
eligible, or as you said under alternative arrangements from Certicom.
Since the GPL excludes distribution of code with patents that limit
their distribution other than by specific country, the patent
encumbrance that would accompany the code would prevent it from being
released under GPL.
The possible twist that I see is if the NSA declares that any freely
available open source software that interoperates with Suite B is by
definition "in support of US national security interests" and therefore
automatically gets one of their sublicenses. That would effectively
remove the patent encumbrance for GPL code. There would still be patent
restrictions on the code, but they would not apply to open source freely
redistributable code, therefore would not get in the way of the GPL.
Oh, no, that would not be strictly true. GPL allows you to do anything
at all with the code if you use it for yourself without distributing it.
Patent restrictions still apply to such uses. They could be uses that
are not "in support of US national security interests". Therefore you
still could not distribute the code under GPL as the people you give it
to would not have the patent rights to modify the code for their own
private modified use if they do not distribute the changes.
So it still comes down to what I think is the important point: BSD
licensed Suite B code may be possible, GPL'd Suite B code is not
possible unless Certicom makes appropriate free license to the patents
available for software licensed under GPL.

Schneier deals with that explicitly when he makes the suggestion, on pp 115-117
in Practical Cryptography, referring to "theoretical results" rather than
referencing Krawczyk's paper directly.
Krawczyk's paper shows that authenticate before encryption is not secure under
assumptions that are not realistic, such as the encryption being subject to a
chosen ciphertext attack, use of ECB mode, separate MAC authentication of each
block along with an encryption oracle so you can use a kind of block level
replay attack in CBC mode. If you use a good cipher with an appropriate mode
and apply the authentication to the entire message with proper use of message
ID or timestamp to prevent replay attacks, you avoid Krawczyk's vulnerabilities
four times over.
Schneier deals with the argument about potential DoS attacks by pointing out
that most real-life DoS attacks saturate the communication channel, not the CPU.
He also presents arguments for authenticating before encrypting which I won't

Try this:
Generate 256000 bytes from MD5(i), i=1...16000 and run the same tests. That is
clearly not acceptable as a PRNG because it is completely predictable if you
know that the sequence is MD5(1) ... MD5(16000), but it should pass any tests
other than one that checks specifically if it is correlated to MD5(1) ...
Perhaps you would say that example is unfair because MD5 makes a perfectly good
PRNG as long as the software package seeds it properly. In that case, how are
you going to ensure that the package you are testing is seeding the PRNG properly?
In fact, the famous Netscape vulnerability was based on a PRNG that was simply
MD5 of a counter, with the vulnerability being predictability of the seed. See
 for a clear
description of that.
Your tests would not detect that kind of vulnerability.
You asked,
The point is that your tests will not detect the difference between a PRNG
using a properly seeded MD5(counter) and one with a predictable seed. More
generally, a sequence can be predictable while still being statistically random.
Carrying it even further, back in 1996 the only problem with using MD5 of a
counter as a PRNG was making sure that the seed was unpredictable. That may not
be true anymore because of recent results of MD5 collisions, or more
accurately, it may not remain true if stronger attacks continue to be found.
Statistical tests have not all of a sudden changed their results: MD5 will not
appear any less random in those tests just because vulnerabilities are found.
So how do you certify PRNGs used by your customers? You have them use well
known software packages that have been analyzed and vetted by the cryptographic
community, such as OpenSSL. It would be a shock if any of them did not pass the
simple statistical tests that you can perform. Passing those tests does not
ensure that there are none of the more subtle vulnerabilities that are only
discovered by many smart people taking a very hard look over a significant time

There's an informative article in a Wired blog in which Hushmail CTO
Brian Smith provides some information that hints at what happened in
this case, although he would not speak specifically about the case.
See His implication is that the target was using their simplified version of
Hushmail that encrypts on the server, using an SSL connection to send
passphrase from the client to the server then providing an interface
similar to ordinary webmail. The court order may have required Hushmail
to save and hand over the password and/or the decrypted mail. Since
Brian Smith would not say exactly what happened in this case, we can't
tell if they modified the system to save the target's password the next
time they used it and handed that over along with historical stored
encrypted mail, or if the modification was to save unencrypted mail sent
after the court order was received, or something else I haven't thought
of. In any case, Smith said that Hushmail only complies with court
orders that target specific accounts and would not take any action that
would affect users not specifically targeted by a court order.
My reading of Smith's statements in interview is that Hushmail would be
subject to a court order requiring them to supply a hacked Java applet
to someone who is using their Java based client-side encryption. There
is no doubt that would be technically feasible, it is mentioned  and
would fall within the guidelines for court orders that Smith said that
Hushmail would comply with.

The test is easy and disproves the idea, as demonstrated in these two links:
A microwave oven is a better choice, as it is designed to function as a
Faraday cage.
However, might not the audio insulation and the hum of the refrigerator motor
when the phone is inside the refrigerator in another room be sufficient to
mask the conversation?
I did some Googling about that. According to Table 1 in
the approximate sound insulation of a modern refrigerator varies by frequency,
with the lowest amount in the voice frequency range being about 13dB. The
sound from the fan is about 30dB.
According to
normal conversational voice levels at a distance of 12 feet (3.7m) would be 48dB.
I'm not sure from the literature I've seen how much dB loss to allow for there
being a wall and closed door between the room the meeting is in and the
kitchen. Maybe 30dB for a typical non-insulated interior wall rated at STC 33?
I think that means that there could be up to 5dB of sound energy at the worst
frequencies making it to the inside of the refrigerator, and 30dB of hum from
the fan. If there are two walls, and/or at least 5m distance between the
meeting and the refrigerator that should be enough.
I don't know what would make me feel safer - putting the phones in a microwave
oven with the chance that the door could easily be left ajar, or getting the
acoustic insulation and masking hum of a refrigerator.

Version 3.0 and 3.1 still contain a clause that requires your code to be

@_subject: [Cryptography] Generating random values in a particular range 
Oh, right, the patent is actually about taking the output of the RNG which
might be fewer bits than the length of the number you want when generating a
key and hashing it to get the right bit length. Like for example when
generating a RSA key you can take so many random bits and hash them to a
longer bit string of fixed length L that you then test for primality. If
before you do the primality test you first reject the hash result if as an
integer it is greater than some particular L-bit length prime, then you have
done what the claims of the patent say.
The patent is not about generating a uniform random variable in a range.
What that means is that if you do what we are talking about here, generate a
uniform random integer between 0 and N by rejecting any output of the
underlying PRNG that is larger than N, then it has nothing to do with this patent.
Now I'm curious. Do the primality tests that are usually used for generating a
prime of some fixed length L for a key that needs a large prime such as RSA
make use of some specific L-bit prime that the result must be less than? Or
will any L bit random number be run through the same primality test? Because
if all you do is hash some 256 bit random number to get 2048 bits that contain
256 bits of entropy and then test it for primality without as a first step
checking if the 2048 bit number is too large, you have not practiced the
claims of this patent. So is this patent obvious or is it useless?

@_author: Sidney Markowitz 
@_subject: [Cryptography] Generating random values in a particular range 
I read the description part of the patent which provides some context for how
it came about.
This has to do with a vulnerability in the DSA implementation standard that
was discovered by Daniel Bleichenbacher and announced in November 2000. FIPS
186-2 described generating a 160-bit prime less than some specific 160-bit
prime p by taking the SHA-1 hash of a larger random number (I got it backwards
when I was speculating in my last email) mod p. Bleichenbacher showed an
attack based on the non-uniformity of that result. This was fixed in FIPS
186-2 Change Notice 1, which was later superseded by FIPS 186-4. The original
approach to fixing the problem involved two hashes. Someone people apparently
managed to file for a patent on the idea of doing one hash and discarding
results that were too big before NIST published the change notice with that
In FIPS 186-4 NIST presents two methods for fixing the problem, I presume
because the second method they list is encumbered by the patent. Their first
method is to get a random bit string of length L+64 and then take that mod the
L bit prime. The idea is that the extra 64 bits before the mod results in
enough uniformity.
FIPS 186-4, unlike FIPS 186-2, does not specify how the random bits are
generated. One way would be to apply a hash that has the requested bit length
output to the output of a PRNG that has the right number of bits of entropy
for the desired security strength. That would make the second method be
impacted by the patent.

@_author: Sidney Markowitz 
@_subject: [Cryptography] Generating random values in a particular range 
Looking at it more, this looks like a submarine patent originally filed by
Certicom soon after Bleichenbacher announced the vulnerability, aimed at
catching out anyone using their obvious fix that ended up in common
implementations of DSA. FIPS 186 says "The algorithms in the Standard may be
covered by U.S. or foreign patents" but doesn't call out anything specific.
I just did a quick check of source code for DSA parameter generation in
OpenSSL and at least in the version I glanced at they seem to use the second
method that is specified in FIPS 186-4, which is the variation on the first
fix for Bleichenbacher's vulnerability that was specified in FIPS 186-2 Change
Notice 1. This was in
 where the first
step in checking for primality is to check if the random number (which is the
hash of the output of a PRNG) is greater than p. The call to it in
dsa/dsa_gen.c does loop until the primality test returns true, and so does
what the patent claims describe.
This means that it is irrelevant that there are prior examples of rejection
sampling. This is not a patent on rejection sampling. It is a patent on using
rejection sampling to eliminate the bias when generating a series of candidate
random numbers between 0 and L-bit prime p by getting an initial random number
(the seed) from a PRNG, hashing it to get a number of length L, rejecting it
if it is greater than p before checking it for primality, then if it is
rejected doing any transformation of the seed including simply incr4menting
it, hashing that new value, and trying again.
Challenging this patent would probably involve trying to convince the PTO or
the courts and/or a jury that once you know that the problem is that a simple
mod p introduces bias, the solution is obvious to anyone who has any expertise
in random number generation that you can solve the problem by using rejection
sampling in this way. Considering that the original algorithm was "1) take
H(seed) mod p to ensure a value less than p; 2) check if it is prime; 3) if it
isn't prime, increment or otherwise get a new seed to hash and loop back,
otherwise exit" and the new patented algorithm is identical except that
instead of taking the hash mod p in step 1 you instead make step 2 "check if
it smaller than p and is prime", there should be a good case for it being
obvious. However that makes the patent lawsuit something unpredictable. It is
not the slam dunk that it would be if it were an attempt to patent rejection
sampling itself.
This does actually look worse, though, as it means that Blackberry might be
going after anyone who is using OpenSSL and likely some other common libraries
for DSA. To work around the patent you would have to generate a hash at least
L+64 bits long, not too convenient when you are using a standard hash that is
the same length as the prime p.
Again, the patent is not relevant to the uniform random number generator in
the library that started this thread.

It looks like a fundamental flaw that is being exploited is a lack of

scripts. A comment in the above linked article mentions that the exploit could
be done without recursion because it really was an exploit of a function that
performed an operation that transfers money, then calls another function that
contained a call to a function controlled by the attacker, and only then
updated the balances that were changed by the transfer.
What that analysis ignores is that it was possible to have a function that
manipulates the balances which in the middle of that manipulation can call
another function that manipulates the balances. Isn't a fundamental
requirement of a system like this that it be possible to grab and release
locks on shared resources?

Bob has unfair control in step 2, or it is not, in which case Alice has unfair

@_subject: [Cryptography] Proposal of a fair contract signing protocol 
Ok, I went over all the previous messages you have sent in this thread and
extracted everything you have said that regards the definition of what is fair
or not fair and how each step in the protocol makes it fair.
As far as I can tell you define "not fair" as being the situation in which one
person is "fully committed" to contract C when the other person is not "fully
committed" to contract C. You define "fair" as the situation in which both
parties become "fully committed" at a single moment.
The most recent way you summarized the definition "fully committed":
"Fully committed by a partner means he/she has signed both X and Y
or has promised to sign both because a certain condition is satisfied"
Since you say that Alice is not "fully committed" after step 1, you must be
saying that the promise does not make her fully committed until the condition
of the promise is satisfied by Bob signing C in step 2.
You have not specified any protocol for "promise". How is it proven that A
promised to sign Y without having A digitally sign Y or digitally sign a
promise that includes Y?
This leaves no reason for your protocol to require that contract C is split
into separate halves X and Y that are signed separately. You could just as
easily write the contract to say "Alice and Bob agree to this transaction
subject to this contract being signed by both Alice and Bob" and then have
both Alice and Bob "promise" to sign it conditional on the other person
signing it. If you do that, then a single signature provides the simultaneous
commitment that you require for "fairness", according to your definitions.
This protocol puts all the power into the "promise" which binds Alice, but you
never define how a binding promise can be made without the promise itself
being a contract that has to be put into effect in a "fair" fashion. That
leads to an endless recursion.

You never mentioned that the promise is what is signed in step 1. You said
that Alice only signs X in step 1 and promises to sign C = X | Y if Bob signs
it in step 2. How could Alice sign a promise to sign X and Y if what she signs
only includes X? And if Alice does have to sign "I promise to sign Contract C
= X | Y within time T1 after Bob signs Contract C if he signs within time T2"
and she is bound by that, then that promise is an unfair contract by your

If "signcryption" means, as you said, that step 1 sends signed(Alice,
encrypt(Bob, signed(Alice, X)|"I, Alice, promise to sign X|Y when Bob signs
X|Y")) then Alice has never signed her promise, all she has signed is a
message that is encrypted with Bob's public key with no proof that she even
knows what is in it. If you have Alice sign the promise, then the promise
itself is a contract that she fully commits to in Step 1 and so is unfair by
your definition. There is still the recursion.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Proposal of a fair contract signing protocol 
Well, at least you have made it clear that it is different than the Two
Generals problem, so we can't simply say that what you are trying to do has
been proven impossible that way. The Two Generals problem says (roughly) that
it is impossible for two parties to unequivocally come to an agreement over an
unreliable channel. Your protocol is allowed to time out without any contract
coming into effect if it takes too long, so that is not an issue.
No, this is not obvious. Someone always has to be first to sign a contract,
but a contract does not come into effect before both parties agree to it.
If signing is what makes commitment then whoever signs first is committed
first. In your protocol Alice first signs the promise. She is committed to
contract P (the promise) which requires her to do certain things in exchange
for Bob providing his signature on C. Bob has no corresponding commitment.
That is unfair by your definition, but does not seem particularly unfair to
me. When someone proposes a contract C, at some point they need to commit to
something so that the other party has a reason to commit to something else.
All you have done is make the promise that first stage of commitment and then
called it "fair" because it is conditional on Bob's act of commitment.
If signed conditional promises make it fair by your definition then there is
no need for your protocol: Alice writes C to include the clause "This contract
comes into effect as soon as it is signed by both Alice and Bob as long as
both signatures are done and the signed document is published by time T." Then
it can be signed in any order and it is still fair by your definition.
At this point I don't see that you are clarifying any more, only repeating
your initial statement of the protocol. You have not explained why Alice
signing the promise is any different than an "unfair" signing of C, or why
signing a C that says that it is conditional on Bob's signature is not just as
fair as signing a conditional promise to sign C. If you simply repeat a
description of your protocol without answering those questions I don't see any
further purpose in discussion.

There is a difference between checking every one of the 2^256 4096 bit numbers

all the calculations needed to factor a 4096 bit number. However both will
take you more time and resources than you have.
Both take much longer than factoring a 256 bit RSA key. Which is why 256 bits
is enough entropy to generate the key but the key has to be 4096 bits.

A minor point, but RFC1924 explains why using b85 is better than b94 if you
want to encode 128 bits. Short form of the explanation is that both of them
need 19 and a fraction chars to hold 128 bits, i.e. they both will encode to
20 chars, and b85 lets you choose more characters for other uses such as to
delimit the string.

@_subject: [Cryptography] National Navajo Code Talkers Day 
Tracking this down I actually found a bit of cryptographic relevance :)
The short answer is that they didn't have a word for shark, they did have a
word for "fish" and various adjectives that could be used if they had a
concept regarding fish to express, and their ancestors migrated from British
Columbia by way of other places that had water and fish.
First, the cryptography part:
One reference I found from a Google Books search into "Secret History: The
Story of Cryptology"
It describes the Navajo code talking as not a simple matter of native Navajo
speakers conversing in their language. It was a cipher that used Navajo words
to encode the English alphabet. For example, the letter C was a Navajo word
for "cow" rotated with two other words that translated to English words that
begin with "c". Similarly, A was a word for "ant" rotated with two other
words. To shorten the messages, a number of designated plaintext words were
represented by Navajo words. Three of those words I saw listed charts were
[battleship - lo-tso - whale], [destroyer - ca-lo - shark], [submarine -
besh-lo - iron fish]
However, according to that reference the code words were made up by the code
talkers for use among themselves and were not necessarily the common native
speaker words for anything. I noticed that an online Navajo English dictionary
(which I do not claim be authoritative) has this for "shark"
 containing two different Navajo entries
łóóʼ hashkéhé
Elsewhere I saw it mentioned that the first one literally means "angry fish".
Thus, "ca-lo" is [some adjective] - fish, not even properly phonetically
transcribed and not necessarily how a native Navajo speaker would refer to a
Some other discussions I found pointed out that even a native Navajo speaker
who was not trained in the code talking would not understand the messages as
more than a meaningless sequence of nouns. The language contains phonemes that
would be difficult for a non-native speaker to distinguish, especially true
for the Japanese, making it difficult for the messages to be transcribed for
And finally,
An interesting history with quotes from a 19th century anthropologists, which
includes the comment "He notes that Navajo basically has only one word for
'fish': łóó’, a generic term referring to all fish".

[...]> sufficient I could test it to produce a collision in the last sixty or
If the "technobabble" tried to say  that hashes could be broken in less than brute force times without using some specific cryptanalysis of the hash algorithm, it is probably nonsense. But if you really do intend to only use the last n bits of the hash and you really are trying to protect against collision, then 60 bits may not be good enough.
Brute force lets you find some two blocks with a collision on an n-bit hash by trying on the order of 2^(n/2) hashes on random blocks. The algorithm is to generate blocks, hash each, and save the results in a way that you could quickly find when you have encountered the hash before and what data block made it. The details are left as an exercise. Because of the birthday "paradox" finding a collision makes it n/2 instead of n when you don't care which two blocks have the collision.
If what you are concerned about is second preimage resistance, i.e., given a specific block of data  find a different block that hashes to the same value as the first, that would take on the order of 2^n hashes to brute force, but you would not have to use the memory to save all the hashes you compute until you find it.
Which of the two you are concerned with depends on your threat model. Collision resistance protects against somebody producing two things that have the same hash and using them in some kind of bait and switch scam. But if what you want to use the has for is to prove that an item you supply has not been tampered with, all you need is second preimage resistance.
When you say "the last n bits of the hash", that's the n that you use in those estimates. Finding a collision in just the last 60 bits would only take on the order of a bit more than a billion hashes and a billion numbers in memory. What would that be, a few hours on just one core and tens of GB of RAM? But if you really intended to use the full 160 bits of a 160-bit hash, then you are looking at 2^80, so multiply that by another 2^50 which would be bigger than is feasible.
And if you really meant second preimage, even only using the last 60 bits would require a brute force attack to calculate 2^60 hashes, which my really rough fermi estimate tells me would be more than a thousand years running on a thousand cores.

One important point of the article is that a result of PASSED does not mean that the RNG has passed a test, it means that it has with high probability not failed; a result of FAILED means that it has with high probability failed; and a result of WEAK indicates uncertainty in the results, not that the RNG is close to passing or close to failing a test. WEAK is an indication that you need to make the test stronger (e.g. with more p samples) until the uncertainty is resolved one way or another. The article is a demonstration of how to do that.

I don't think that works as a verb substituting for "copy". People aren't familiar with that use of the verb "abstract" will not understand what is being said. The Oxford definition at  defines that sense of the verb as "Extract or remove (something)" and then says "Used euphemistically to indicate that someone has stolen something" with the first example sentence referring to stealing concrete objects and the second using "abstracting electricity". The legal term may be because electricity is not a "thing" that can be subject to "stealing" but the action still uses up electric power without replacement, as opposed to copying data and leaving the original. So "abstract" still does not serve as a replacement for "copy".
There may not be a standalone verb to use. But what is wrong with "illegal copying" or "unauthorised copying" choosing the first for an action that is in violation of some law and the second for an action that may or may not actually be illegal but may have moral weight?
