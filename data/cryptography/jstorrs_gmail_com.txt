@_subject: [Cryptography] ideas for (long) Nothing up my sleeve numbers 
For "nothing up your sleeve" what about using well-known data to
reproducibly derive the numbers? For example you could use one of the
typical image processing test images[1] such as cameraman, peppers,
mandril or Lena using versions taken from curated databases[2].
Similarly, you could use census data or other government publications
that are widely archived and curated. The bitcoin blockchain is also a
possibility--you could process the first 1000 or so bitcoin blocks.
Whatever processing would have to be simple and the data you rely on
would have to be unlikely to be crafted by you.

@_subject: [Cryptography] [cryptography] Email encryption for the wider 
As I've been learning more about U2F, I'm growing hopeful that Google
End-to-End encryption (which I understand is an ECC-only OpenPGP
implementation integrated with the Chrome browser) is designed for
integration with the upcoming FIDO/Google U2F devices (which I understand
are ECC-based smartcards -- that Google is also deeply integrating into the
Chrome browser).
My understanding is that U2F implements a public key system where each
website/service/account/device generates unique keys (the design is claimed
to prevent tracking actual U2F devices). If U2F succeeds perhaps in the
future any website you register with using U2F will effortlessly gain the
ability to message to you securely via the U2F public key? I think I've
seen foreshadowing of this in the documents I've read so far. Yubico
recently announced public availability of U2F yubikey USB tokens are
expected october-ish (the U2F yubikeys are claimed to be widely used within
Google already). I have been very impressed with the usability of yubikey
and I'm optimistic it can support a UI that works well with "general
public" types.

I think the forensics community have nice tools in this realm. In
particular, I find myself using hashdeep a lot.
