Systems that split a password among N nodes, such that no less than N
can collaborate to verify guesses, are described in:
 and
For N=1, some kind of special hardware embedded solution seems
to be required.  Think smartcards, TCPA, and initiatives to build
this general capability into standard PC BIOS such as:

Do your parties have any shared secret information?
If they share a cryptographic key, they can use a
simple hash-based challenge/response protocol.
If the have shared passwords or any other small
secrets, they can use EKE or SPEKE.
There are lots of neat tricks that might be applicable,
but you should first describe your needs in more detail.

I think Ed's criticism is off-target.  Where is the "privacy problem" with
Chaum receipts when Ed and others still have the freedom to refuse
theirs or throw them away?
It seems a legitimate priority for a voting system to be designed to
assure voters that the system is working.  What I see in serious
voting system research efforts are attempts to build systems that
provide both accountability and privacy, with minimal tradeoffs.
If some kind of tradeoff between accountability and privacy is inevitable,
in an extreme scenario, I'd still prefer the option to make the tradeoff for
myself, rather than have the system automatically choose for me.
