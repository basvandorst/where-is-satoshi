I think the "Rip Van Winkle cipher" was mentioned in Schneier's Applied Cryptography.  Also, I vaguely recall another news story (1999?) that reported on an encryption technique that hypothesized a stream of random bits generated by an orbiting satellite.
"Quasar encryption" is likely impractical, but there could be more to it than you think.  However, I did think "web cam encryption" was funny. :-)

If you have a linear algebra book handy, look up "linear transformation".
Briefly, a function T from a vector space V to another vector space W (where V and W are defined over the same field) is called a
linear transformation if it satisfies
i) T(u +_V v) = T(u) +_W T(v)
ii) T(c *_V u) = c *_V T(u)
iii) T(0_V) = 0_W
CRC is a linear transformation because
CRC(u + v) = CRC(u)+CRC(v).

How Fast can be Algebraic Attacks on Block Ciphers ?
Nicolas T. Courtois
Abstract. In this paper we give a specification of a new block cipher that can be called the Courtois Toy Cipher (CTC). It is quite simple, and yet very much like any other known block cipher. If the parameters are large enough, it should evidently be secure against all known attack methods. However, we are not proposing a new method for encrypting sensitive data, but rather a research tool that should allow us (and other researchers) to experiment with algebraic attacks on block ciphers and obtain interesting results using a PC with reasonable quantity of RAM. For this reason the S-box of this cipher has only 3-bits, which is quite small. Ciphers with very small S-boxes are believed quite secure, for example the Serpent S-box has only 4 bits, and in DES all the S-boxes have 4 output bits. The AES S-box is not quite as small but can be described (in many ways) by a very small systems of equations with only a few monomials (and this fact can also be exploited in algebraic cryptanalysis). We believe that results on algebraic cryptanalysis of this cipher will have very deep implications for the security of ciphers in general.

@_subject: man in the middle, SSL 
I was reading a hacking blog today and came across this:
 It is my understanding that SSL is engineered to resist mitm attacks, so I am suspicious of these claims.  I wondered if someone more familiar with SSL/TLS could comment.
Isn't in the case that the application doing SSL on the client should detect what this proxy server is doing and display a warning to the user?

I thought this was an interesting security-related story:
quoting from the article:
Anyone heard of this before?  Is there a reason why a car theft can't simply remove or cover up these stickers?
