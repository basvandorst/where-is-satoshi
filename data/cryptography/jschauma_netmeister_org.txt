I believe the argument is that it's "good enough" for people who already
"know" the party they're trying to reach to some degree and within our
various online networks/identities.
I may know somebody from Twitter, but may not know them to be the author
of some software on GitHub whom I'm trying to reach; keybase.io could
help tie those two identities together and link to an associated
Disclaimer: I'm not saying that there aren't many other ways to
accomplish this; nor am I saying that keybase.io is all sorts of
wonderful or should even be trusted for what it claims to do.  I'm just
noting that that's the use case I've heard being made.
Along similar lines, I've argued[1] that if I tweet my PGP fingerprint,
and you already follow me on Twitter, you can probably sign it (so long
as you don't believe Twitter was compromised or works actively against

@_subject: [Cryptography] The vultures circle... 
[Feel free to moderate from list; I just might be rambling.]
The real danger here is the ever applicable Gell-Mann Amnesia effect[1];
*we* know this is hogwash, but the majority of the people take it as
fact that Evil Doers(tm) are empowered (solely) by spooky encryption
(and what do the rest of us have to hide anyway?).
On the brighter side, though, not all media is willing to throw us under
the bus just yet.  The editorial board of the NY Times, after its
journalists initially fell into the "uhoh, crypto" trap[2], asserted
well that
  requiring that companies build such back doors into their
  devices and software could make those systems much more
  vulnerable to hacking by criminals and spies.[3]
As bleak as Crypto Wars 2.0 (or is it 2.1 now? Who keeps track?) look
today, I like to think that all is not lost.  For every 5 articles
conjuring the crypto boogie man, there is still one that tries to
keep some balance.
But yes, we do need everybody's help.  The coming election will no doubt
be shaped by the events in Paris; the positions taken by the candidates
already reflect what they think their supporters or target audience
wants them to say.  As cynical as I am, I hope the repugnant statements
this has already elicited will in fact be to their detriment.

@_subject: [Cryptography] SSH key text format: 
IIRC the formats used by OpenSSH are not defined anywhere but in their
code.  (I once went through that when trying to figure out how to
convert between RFC4716 and OpenSSH formats:
The format is base64 encoded tuples of four bytes of length of field
followed by field, I think.  So the leading 'AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5'
00 00 00 0b                        = length 11
73 73 68 2d  65 64 32 35 35 31 39  = ssh-ed25519
etc. etc.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Products that prevent DoH? 
To the best of my understanding, the only way to
reliably prevent the use of DoH is by controlling the
client settings on the endpoint in question:
- NXDOMAIN'ing the canary domain only applies in the
  case of default DoH opt-in, not in the case of
  explicit opt-in[1]
- blocking well-known public DNS resolvers that offer
  DoH (as the verbiage "we have certain feeds"
  suggests) only works if the client falls back to the
  default resolver; at least Firefox can be configured
  to fail hard if DoH is not available (network.trr.mode=3
  combined with a manual DoH host set; the second part
  is necessary, as otherwise Firefox will attempt to
  resolve the IP address of the default DoH server via
  the standard resolver).
- DoH by design is HTTPS traffic, so a user can set up
  their _own_ DoH resolver somewhere, and the solution
  in question wouldn't have it in their feeds (and
  blocking TCP to port 443 in e.g. AWS is not a
  broadly workable solution)
The only other method besides controlling the client
settings by which this could conceivably work is if
they control the endpoint, require installation of a
trusted root cert, MitM all outgoing HTTPS
connections and then block DoH traffic via packet
inspection, but that does not match the "we have
certain feeds" verbiage.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Products that prevent DoH? 
This only works for the case of the default opt-in to
DoH, not for a client that explicitly enabled DoH via
their configuration.
I'm making this point here again because it is such a
common misconception, and I only recently got Mozilla
to update the description to make this somewhat more
obvious by adding the note:
"Note: The canary domain only applies to users who
have DoH enabled as the default option. It does not
apply for users who have made the choice to turn on
DoH by themselves."
