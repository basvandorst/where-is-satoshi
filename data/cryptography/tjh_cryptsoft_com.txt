@_subject: [Cryptography] SSH small RSA public exponent 
Does anyone recollect the history behind and the implications of the
(open) SSH choice of 35 as a hard-wired public exponent?
key.c:  private = RSA_generate_key(bits, 35, NULL, NULL);
i.e.  100011 binary compared to the more typical F4 10000000000000001 binary

@_subject: [Cryptography] New slogan for the NSA 
And I have two of those posters on the wall in the office ... they are
relatively scarce items - and rather nicely produced.
The posters are not actually dated ... but they are certainly pre-2000
from memory.
"A good marketing organization listens to its customers. WE HEAR YOU.
Your National Security Agency"
Including 1995 artwork from Tom Tomorrow.
