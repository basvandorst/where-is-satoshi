yes, but the idea and rc5 support can be disabled by removing the
directories, whereas the license in question is spread all
over the source tree.

I don't think so.  The SSH packet format is _much_ simpler than ASN.1
and neither the original ssh-1.x nor OpenSSH had problems due to
the packet parsing, both have been immune to last years malformed
packet tests.   I've seen more problems related to ASN.1 parsing
than to SSH packet parsing...
