I'd recommend taking a look a RFC 5054 (  Nearly all applications of SRP use application-wide choices for N and g, usually the ones standardized by IETF.  The main advantage of such standardization is that clients do not have to verify safety of N and g on each transaction, which can be time-consuming.
