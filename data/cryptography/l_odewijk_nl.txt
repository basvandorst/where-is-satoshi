@_subject: [Cryptography] Kindle as crypto hardware 
2013/12/4 Phillip Hallam-Baker Doesn't it carry Linux under it's skin? Regardless, what rights does Amazon
have? Doesn't it just include "read block level data"? It has WiFi or even
3G, whose chips themselves come with exploits. I'm little aware about
exploits to specific hardware chips.
I do think you could fry the WiFi, easily input messages, and use it as a
simple textual data storage device. You can even encrypt the data behind a
solid password.
It is a tad big for what you want it to be though.
I'd also need more info about your demands. It's also important to consider
redundant storage, which will be hard with a single Kindle. Having multiple
Kindles has it's own problems, especially because it's either a lot of work
or requires Internet. And Kindles break. Someone sat on mine at some point,
and it becomes instantly useless.
And, if you write your own software, why not build your own device? Take a
Raspberry or Arduino, a simple display (a non volatile one if you like) and
~30-40 of pushbuttons for a keyboard + controls (depends on what you want
with it). The Raspberry is open source more than most others, and might've
had sufficient scrutiny to find exploits on the hardware level (probably
not). The Arduino is build on such a simplistic little chip that it can
hardly have exploits, except where it's just a bad RNG and fully timeable
input. But you expect those. It takes a little wiring together, but it
should be on the simpler side of hardware projects. Order the parts of
digikey or the like, make the printboard on  order it
off of any local manufacturer (pay extra but actually get what you asked
for), solder that stuff on.
Tips on DIY hardware or tips on DIY hardware welcome.

Why not just use a piece of paper? Except if you'd like it to do
calculations for you. In which case you should keep to "something that
stores data and does certain calculations".
Definitely NOT get *nix! That's asking for trouble.
If you take anything morepowerfull than an Arduino there'll likely be
I strongly recommand rolling your own.
Battery + PIC + display (example )
+ keyboard (example)
= 30-40 USD
Only the PIC needs to be disposed of. I'd mount it in a socket, and then
replacing it costs <2USD (depends on the PIC ofc). You could use the PIC's
volatile memory to store data, that way you can destroy your keys easily in
a pickle (just yank the PIC out of it's socket). It'd be insanely hard to
retrieve the data after that indeed.
The display and keyboard I picked are both cellphone components. The
display mounted to a PCB for easy reuse. The keyboard has a flex cable,
which might be a bother. I'm sure you have an old cellphone around, else
you can check any thrift store and reuse a phone they didn't think they'd
ever get rid off anymore. (those I did visit usually have a bunch in the
back. I even found one that trashed them as "electronics waste", and I
could take a bundle for free!)
If you want to buy a kindle that's fine too. Ebay has a ton of "kindle
keyboard" kindles for about 45 USD. But remember you are not getting nearly
the security you could have gotten. And it's only a tease easier, and a lot
less fun. Maybe the most important thing is that it's totally uncool
compared to a hacked together little device.

We need an alternative for the tooth fairy. The alternative will pop up

I'm not sure why it's so bad that the alternative shouldn't be present.
Maybe because you can never quite expect. Sometimes he listens to you and
tells your mom, or girlfriend. Sometimes he fuzzes your paperwork around
when you're not looking. Sometimes he jumps out of hiding and hits you
square in the balls. He leaves you mostly intact though, just hurts you in
some terrible merciless way.
It symbolizes the presence of a dangerous mistake. It should inspire
scrupulous checking of the room you enter or leave. It should inspire not
having anything in the room to make the chance at mistakes less.
Then the one little black box with the big Intel logo on the side. That's
going to be just as suspicious as I always thought this whole

2013/12/25 Bill Cox Wasn't scrypt mostly intended to not work on anything but a CPU? It works
on GPUs now but with the advent of Turning Complete GPU kernels and
gigabytes of GPU RAM that's really hard to avoid.
I just think being secure was also important, but not by far as important
as consistent speed. I don't actually know the algorithm though. So I can't
comment on the cryptanalysis side of things.
However, paranoia can be fun, so go nuts:
There's definitely something going on there 0_0.... How hard is it to input

But then some people have to move away from mut!
It's also not actually superior. What do you really gain? Hard to archive.
No more transparant to browse. More susceptible to a lot of things.
Ultimately the premise is the same:
Medium = [Subject]
Subject = (String, [Email])
Email = (Headers, String)
The only arguable difference is in catagorization. It's like a single tag
is added to every subject. Usually called the 'category'. People always
miscatagorize and this list is supposed to be pretty much a single category
If there's really a need for tags we can prepend them to our subject lines.
"[pol]" or "[tech]" are the mayor mayor differences. We can also put intent
into them, but that would require more thought of notation. Stuff like
"publish" or "Request For Comments" or "Discuss" or "news" would be
interesting tags.
In the end the ability of present forums to organize discussion is
dissapointing to the potential. Additionally the workflow of present forums
is far inferior to mailing lists.
Worst of all is reputation systems inherent in forums. Reputation is not
earned through any one objective measure, especially a non personalizable
one. All systems attempt to approximate, and often fail.
To me the answer is: rather not.
 * Potential for more advanced discussions (metadata)
 * Sometimes easier to manage large volumes or content or users (community
 * Doesn't distract as much as e-mail (more self-contained)
 * More personalizable profiles (username, signature, profile picture,
bio/contact info)
 * (Maybe) easier to do psuedononymously
 * Not embedded in standards. (subject to strange change)
 * No to very very little archivability (will dissapear, with content, more
 * Does not fit existing workflow that works through e-mail (Less
 * Far from client native user interface; E-mail sees better support than
"the web", because it's simpler. (Lowered usability)
 * Increased hassle will likely decrease users. The forums don't end up in
your inbox, so to speak. E-mail aggregates into your mail-client, forums
are spread thin accross countless pages. (Additional effort, not just a
habitual argument.)

@_subject: [Cryptography] TAO, NSA crypto backdoor program 
This actually took about 5 hours. I hope it will be useful to anyone. I
sure feel up to date with the NSA 5 years ago. Some things are impressive.
Their prices too though. Their level of determination and systematic
approaches too. Miniaturization skill is good too, but not quite james
bond. Particularly the use of RAGEMASTER and the other radar thingies. The
exploitation of routers is just the tip of the iceberg of exploits. GSM
exploits should really be commonly accepted to exist by now.
Feel free to ask me questions, forward this mail to others, reformat it
into wiki format or something, correct me if I'm wrong, ask me for my
Bitcoin address because I'm your personal hero. Anything. I'm going to bed.
2013/12/30 Raphael Jacquot that until now I've seen the NSA as an overfunded academic project to find
exploits everywhere, but that all they want is all the information in any
possible way. The return on investment of those projects presented is
occasionally very low. That's the scariest part. They might even have
exploited this and that rare thing.
Then I realized I never trusted hardware one bit, that PCB-track radio is
real and fun and exploitable, and that I have always been confused by the
lack of in-system paranoia. I think the whole thing is quite funny because
against consumers it seems an ineffective budget spend. It's probably
focused on companies though. Anyway, it's all kind of fun to me at the
moment. Guess it'd be different if I actually used these products.
Anyone see the irony of America banning Chinese router stuff and meanwhile
exploiting all of its own products?
the full gadget catalogue is here
I'm impressed. I also considered physical to be uselessly aggressive
compared to the wealth of software hacks. Curious.
This does seriously harm the NSA's interests. This gives us clear insight
into their recent capabilities. I think this is not data from our good old
source. This is probably someone else. Luckily I'm not American and I
believe that justifies fully all that I'm doing now.
ANT = Advanced or Access Network Technology
Allow me to recap the available tools:
DEITYBOUNCE - Dell PowerEdge BIOS exploit to get software onto target.
Re-implants the exploit when the OS loads using the BIOS exploit. Unclear
if it can be installed just by plugging a USB in, or whether the Non-tech
agent needs to boot into it. Uses ARKSTREAM for implanting itself on the
BIOS. (2007)
IRONCHEF - Similar to DEITYBOUNCE. Additionally communicates over a
bidirectional radio that's also to be implanted into the system. For the HP
Proliant 380DL G5 it uses an I2c connected radio called WAGONBED. IRONCHEF
can be remote controlled to read/write to the target system. Especially to
replace the spy-software placed on it if it's cleared.  (2007)
FEEDTHROUGH - is something to persist ZESTYLEAK and BANANAGLEE in Juniper
Netscreen firewalls. Across reboots and software upgrades. Also a BIOS
level attack (see image). There exists something called a "DNT Implant
Communications Protocol" for remote access and control. It employs a hiding
method on the target platforms. (2008)
GOURMETTROUGH* - persists BANANAGLEE on Juniper firewalls. Some platforms
it can "beacon" regardless of OS. ANT has to configure on non-automated
platforms. Can also place a "Persistent BackDoor" (PBD) if configured by an
expert. (2008)
HALLUXWATER - persistent remote control for Huawei Eudemon firewalls. Has
to be installed as a boot ROM (BIOS) upgrade. Uses PIT (TURBOPANDA
Insertion Tool) to read/write memory, execute local or delivered code.
Survives automatic bootROM (BIOS) upgrades. (2008)
JETPLOW - persists BANANAGLEE on Cisco PIX and Cisco ASA firewalls. Can
also install BANANAGLEE protocol compatible PBDs. Boot time modifies the
OS. Can remotely self-upgrade. Can be added to an existing BANANAGLEE
thingy. (2008)
SOUFFLETROUGH - persists BANANAGLEE for Juniper SSG 500 and SSG 300 series
firewalls. "Advanced" PBD capability. Boot time modifies the OS. Can
fallback to BANANAGLEE compatible PBD. *TAKES ADVANTAGE OF Intel's System
Management Mode* for enhanced reliability and covertness. Can remotely
self-upgrade. Can be added to an existing BANANAGLEE thingy. (2008)
HEADWATER - PBD for some Huawei routers. Goes into the boot ROM via an
upgrade (makes no sense, "Read Only Memory"), works after reboot. Uses
DNT's HAMMERMILL Insertion Tool (HIT) for controll of the PBD. Can
capture/analyze all passing IP packets. *Cover name for NSA/CIA Huawei
exploiting is TURBOPANDA*. (2008)
SCHOOLMONTANA - persists VALIDATOR for Juniper J-Series routers. The
routers run JUNOS a *custom FreeBSD* by Juniper. BIOS mod that modifies the
OS in memory to run VALIDATOR and "provide persistent kernel modifications
to support implant execution"***. Injects at the end of the "System
Management Mode". Cover term for DNT implants for Juniper J-Series
routers. (2008)
SIERRAMONTANA - SCHOOLMONTANA for Juniper M-Series routers. (2008)
STUCCOMONTANA - SCHOOLMONTANA for Juniper T-Series routers. (2008)
CTX4000 - Continuous Wave (CW) radar unit. (ab)Used to collect VAGRANT and
DROPMIRE data. Reads 1 to 2 GHz at up to 45 MHz per second. Can go from 2
to 1000 Watts. Can be remotely controlled. They use a bloody radar to pick
up signal intel. This is so cool. An aluminum hat probably won't save your
PC when it's getting blasted with this baby. (Last 3 sentences are pure
speculation) (2008)
LOUDAUTO - Audio based RF retro-reflector. A little microphone's analog
output is PPM'ed (Pulse Position Modulation) a square wave (standard in RC
control too!). Those pulses are pulsed towards a FET (Field Effect
Transistor). So when a pulse is sent the FET turns on for a moment. The FET
can be seen on a CW radar well enough to reconstruct the pulses going into
it, and thus the audio in the room. NSA prides the use of COTS hardware, no
trace back to the NSA. Additionally these units consume next to no power!
(~0.000045 watts!). "Part of the ANGRYNEIGHBOR family of radar
retro-reflectors." (2008)
NIGHTSTAND - Wifi interceptor. Runs Fedora Core 3.  Undetectable! N
targets. Works on all WIN-old. *Up to eight miles (12km!) of
effectivity.* Anti-encryption
capabilities undisclosed. (2008)
NIGHTWATCH - VAGRANT receiver. Fancied up rugged laptop loaded with some
signal processing units. Hook it up to CTX4000 or PHOTOANGLO or a general
purpose receiver. Manual signal finding and frame averaging for visibility.
Has built-in forward to NSAW****, which has "analysists". To be replaced by
VIEWPLATE. (2008)
PHOTOANGLO - NSA/GCHQ project to replace CTX4000 with a nicer radar.
Frequencies ('later' aka 'now') up to 4 GHz (x2). Bandwidth up to 450Mhz
(x10). Slim form factor. <10lbs/4.5kg. Otherwise the same as CTX4000.
Connects to NIGHTWATCH, LFS-2 or VIEWPLATE. 40kdollar cost. (2008, planned
for Q1 2009)
SPARROW II - Embedded computer running BLINDDATE tools. WLAN B/G, CF card,
USB, 4x Mini PCI for GPS and multiple WLAN cards. IBM Power PC 405GPR. 16MB
flash, 64MB SDRAM. Linux 2.4. 2 Hrs of battery life. 6kdollar. Can be
traced to the NSA somehow, so "operational restrictions exist for equipment
deployment". Possibly due to PowerPC usage, those things are kinda rare.
TAWDRYYARD - Beacon RF retro-reflector. Toggles a FET to provide a good
Radar profile. Used to find RAGEMASTER units. Part of the ANGRYNEIGHBOR
family of radar retro-reflectors. Extremely low power consumption. (2008)
GINSU - an addition to BULLDOZER that provides persistence to KONGUR.
BULLDOZER is a physical PCI device. KONGUR is a software exploit for
windows 9x to Vista (and thus 7, maybe 8). Reinstalls on reboot, if KONGUR
was removed by upgrades or reinstall.
HOWLERMONKEY - short to medium range radio transceivers. To be used in
other products. Works in CONJECTURE or SPECULATION networks. Compatible
with STRIKEZONE devices that run a "HOWLERMONKEY personality" (assuming it
means wireless protocol). PCBs are layed out according to needs. 16mm by
16mm is totally possible. Run around 800 USD/each (call for quote I guess).
IRATEMONK - Provides persistence by modifying the Hard Drive firmware to
substitute the MBR (the partition table). I suppose it boots itself first,
then continues with the real OS. Image contains extremely complicated
diagram of operations, showing the following systems: SERUM, RETURNSPRING,
SLICKERVICAR, WISTFULTOIL, OIM/JMSQ, SEAGULLFARO, TUNING FORK, SSG, CDR
Diode (high/low?), UNITEDRAKE. ROC. SERUM looks lke a processing cluster,
OIM/JSMQ looks like a database, TUNING FORK might be something that
prioritizes data, SSG's pipe is called "scaling" and is also a database.
CDR Diode might operationally split the NSA's systems and the outside
world, a defense unit. UNITEDRAKE must then be a supranational database,
the united part supports that idea. Somehow UNITEDRAKE or STRAITBAZZARE are
used with SLICKERVICAR "to upload the hard drive firmware onto the target
machine to implant IRATEMONK and its payload". Works on FAT, NTFS, EXT3,
UFS with many WD, Seagate, Maxtor and Samsung drives (which controller?).
I've actually read an post about "hey guys, look, isn't this the most
preposterous ridiculous hack?". I believe it was about harddrives. Seems
the NSA took note!
JUNIORMINT - Is a SoC. ARM9 + FPGA (Xilinx XC4VLX25), add 128MB ddr2 , 64MB
SDRAM and 32MB flash. "Uses the TAO standard implant architecture".
"Dramatic performance improvement over HC12 microcontroller designs."
"Ultra-miniature Flip Chip Module (FCM) will be available for challenging
concealments". FCM  is highly
unusual! These things might be extremely small! (call for quote) (2008, PCB
by 2009, FCM by 2010)
*SOMEBODY REPLICATE THIS INTO A <100$ OPEN SOURCE PROJECT*
(the  that I have is only close ;) )
MAESTRO-II - like JUNIORMINT but slower. Says it is a "Multi-Chip-Module",
meaning everything is connected tightly. ($3-4k each) (2008)
SOMBERKNAVE - When an XP machine is not using wifi (it's not connected)
attempts to connect to an access point and allow OLYMPUS or VALIDATOR to
call home. VALIDATOR will also download OLYMPUS if it can. (costs $50k for
some reason) (2008)
SWAP - BIOS and hard drive's Host Protected Area exploits allow periodic
execution before the OS loads. Works on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris
(everything except Mac?) with FAT32, NTFS, EXT2, EXT3 or UFS 1.0. ARKSTREAM
flashes the BIOS and TWISTEDKILT writes SWAP into the Host Protected Area
on the harddrive.
TRINITY - like MAESTRO-II but more powerfull. (100 @ $625k)
WISTFULTOLL - plugin for UNITEDRAKE and STRAITBIZZARE for getting Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Registry stuff. Can work standalone
from a USB drive and get data out that way, or through
UNITEDRAKE/STRAITBIZZARE. (good fit for COTTONMOUTH too!)
SURLYSPAWN -  Data RF retro-reflector. Depending on the level of the
data-line signal it shifts the square wave it produces. Thus becomes
frequency shift keyed (FSK). Presumably the square wave is fed into a FET
again, but the document doesn't mention it. That FET is visibile on radar
and that allows the data to be transferred. Power consumption isn't
mentioned and it's dated "2007, declassify on 2032" but it's date says
2009. Peculiar. Another ANGRYNEIGHBOR type radar reflector.
DROPOUTJEEP - STRAITBIZARRE for iPhone. Compliant with FREEFLOW and
therefore supported in the TURBULENCE architecture. Communicates over SMS
or GPRS data connections in a covert and encrypted way. Close access
methods are first deployment methods, later the remote installation will be
made. Can do anything with the phone. Anything. (Maybe even activate the
vibrator on funny moments) (In development in 2008, no date seems to be
GOPHERSET - SIM card rootkit. This is crazy. Phase 2+ simcards can make
requests (like sent sms) and are actually minicomputers. This is called the
SIM Toolkit (STK). It can also request Phonebooks, SMS and call logs. It
can be installed through *over the air provisioning* or a USB smartcard
reader. A straw of hope is given when sometimes security keys are required.
How does a company refuse to work with the NSA again? (was finished but
unused in 2007)
MONKEYCALENDAR - As GOPHERSET but gets location data that it politely
requests from the handset.
PICASSO - a modified phone that just leaks everything over SMS. Even room
audio. Seems to be targeted for infiltrators. If someone has had an Eastcom
760c+, Samsung E600, X450, C140 (Arabic or not), suspect him strongly.
(This is why this hurts the NSA)
TOTECHASER - Sattelite phone (Thuraya 2520) exploit. They were still
working on it. Looking for a good deployment tactic, remote too. Mostly
location, contact list and call history at that moment.
TOTEGHOSTLY 2.0 - Windows Mobile STRAITBIZZARE. CHIMNEYPOOL framework.
Compliant with the FREEFLOW project, supported in the TURBULENCE
architecture. A FRIEZERAMP interface using HTTPSlink2 transport module
handles encrypted communications.
CANDYGRAM - A GSM tower "repeater" that texts up to 200 agents when a
target enters the vicinity of it. "GSM Telephone Tripwire". Wonder what
they ever used this for, SMS isn't very synchronized so operations
shouldn't depend upon it. Maybe it's synchronized if the NSA wants it to be?
CROSSBEAM - Connects a modified (WASABI, it looks like from the picture)
GSM product to a WAGONBED controller board (old version of JUNIORMINT?).
Used to intercept GSM voice and data. CHIMNEYPOOL compliant. Can also
contain a DSP (ROCKYKNOB) that's usefull in some cases. I think it just
listens to nearby conversation and then sends it home. It's a bit unclear
if it's implanted into a tower or carried around or something. Confusing.
CYCLONE Hx9 - GSM(900MHz) Network in a box. TYPHON feature base and
applications, whichever those might be. Hella strong (>32km range). Can
even voip with it. NSA can rent it for 70k / 2 months.
EBSR - Active GSM base station and phone. Also a find-a-phone active unit.
Smallish and portableish (1W). Has LANDSHARK/CANDYGRAM capabilities.
Operational Restrictions exist for equipment deployment.
ENTOURAGE - Software defined radio used to find the directional origin of a
radio message. Actually pretty hard to deploy.  Uses the HOLLOWPOINT
platform. Has "ARTEMIS-like" capability for certain waveforms. Works with
NEBULA for find-a-phone in the GALAXY program. Complicated radio stuff.
($70k) (2009)
GENESIS - regular feature phone except it contains a Software Defined Radio
and additional system memory. Connects over Ethernet cable to a laptop for
downloading collected Radio info. Could be used to find-a-phone like
WATERWITCH, 16GB of internal storage and does well with the ladies. They
want to extend it to be WATERWITCH without depending on TYPHON (or similar
NEBULA - Many protocol Network in a Box. Applications unclear. Operational
restrictions exist for equipment deployment. (apparently it's not so sneaky)
TYPHON HX - Tricked out GSM Base Station Router. Network in a box. Can
geolocate users. You'd say it does more (listening in on conversations at
least) but it doesn't seem clear.
WATERWITCH - E-ink find-my-TYPHON-connected phone device. Last mile stuff.
Like parking backwards but towards a phone. Depends upon the TYPHON.
COTTONMOUTH-I - USB connector with HOWLERMONKEY transceiver, TRINITY and a
USB 1.1 hub. It can be remotely upgraded. It can pretend to be any USB
device, and thus use USB exploits to exploit the OS (persistently). It can
also communicate through a wireless mesh using the SPECULATION protocol. It
communicates with DNT's STRAITBIZARRE covertly.
It can break air-gapped networks.
it "will be a GENIE-compliant implant based on CHIMNEYPOOL."
It fits INSIDE of a NORMAL USB-A connector! Can be made to be in a keyboard
too, then it's called MOCCASIN. (1000k per 50 units) (available 2009)
COTTONMOUTH-II - Functionality as COTTONMOUTH-I except a 2.0 USB hub.
Sneaked into a double USB port connector common on motherboards today. Must
be wire-connected to a wireless transmitter elsewhere in the case.
COTTONMOUTH-III - As COTTONMOUTH-II but with a build in transmitter. Is on
the back of the double USB port instead of worked into it. Can be connected
to a long range transmitter elsewhere in the case, but it definitely part
of the local mesh network.
FIREWALK - Connects to the back of the Ethernet + USB stack that's common
on motherboards. Intercepts IP packets on up to Gigabit Ethernet ports or
even creates them. Connects through HOWLERMONKEY transceivers. Can create
an Ethernet tunnel to the ROC or an "intermediate redirector node such as
DNT's DANDERSPRITZ tool.".
RAGEMASTER - Taps the *red channel* on a monitor and becomes as visible to
radar as the signal is strong, IOW: makes the monitor's contents radar
visible. *Is not essential for VAGRANT*, just makes it easier. Advice: when
displaying sensitive data, do it in many colors! Add colorful noise to the
letters, making sure that humans pick it up through the noise. Think of the
colorblind too though. This all will make reconstruction harder. Radar
connects to LFS-2 and a monitor, NIGHTWATCH, GOTHAM or VIEWPLATE. (30$)
Language oddities / intel spills :
"Through interdiction" [x can be implanted], what does this mean, really?
It *should* mean legally approved physical action *I think. *(from IRONCHEF

2013/11/5 Marcel Popescu It seems pretty correct to me. Although I find it very hard to believe in
the light of the vested 50% minimum attack speed.
The "of any size" claim is definitely too strong and they admit it
themselves. If you mine too slowly you're wasting so many blocks to attempt
to get to 2 blocks ahead the costs outweigh the benefits. It seems though
that the balance point may be around 1/4th of the network. And that anyone
higher than could profit greatly from this technique. I can't quite pierce
through their verbosity and see if they made mistakes in obtaining their
1/4th number.
Their algorithm is rather hard to read. Why code against the previous
difference and not the current difference? Weird. In fact the whole thing
qualifies for "hard to read" if you ask me.
I'm not sure if this exploit is a big problem. 1/4th is still "good
enough". Seriously worse than 50% though. Picking a random current block
does make the network less effective in mining overall as more work will be
spend on mining not-the-first-block. That implies that you'll be worse off
too, but I'm not 100% on that. I can see collaborations between pools (to
prefer each others' blocks) to be very profitable too. And not solvable at

2013/11/6 Paul Wouters A simply dumb article. "America" refers to a place in the Netherlands and

How? Context.
So what's the solution that removes the need for single source of Truth?
One to Many relationships in the domain name system. Then some "context"
mechanisms build into your local DNS daemon and browser to deal with the
ambiguity. I'd imagine a simple "vote up or down" would suffice to give the
right domain name to the right people. Provided you, at least practically,
solved the identity problem. Possibly though a Web Of Trust.
I can also imagine central source being plugged in as a "According to
ICANN:". Kind of like "sponsored results" in Google.
The idea that a method for agreeing upon a name with a larger group of
people requires structure is valid. Language itself proves that. In fact
language is a beautiful analogy.
In other words, address agreements are not ?peer to peer?. There is a
Yeah, they are. Words' meanings are P2P too. The thing is you often allow a
peer to make choices, a government for example, or simply comply with the
most common agreement (a surprisingly common protocol). Censorship is a
completely unnatural idea. The natural alternative is filtering, and it is
done at the peer level. That's a form of self censorship and it remains a
problem, imagine a community not propagating .xxx domain names. Anyway.
You do not need central control. You need an agreeable and compatible
protocol. You do not need censorship, you need ranking.
Simply ranking ICANN 100% trusted  and everyone else 0% is not only
simplistic but also foolish. You seem to want to find out why.
Which atlas? You'll note there's quite some differences, and there have
been. But DNS is mostly consistent (every day!).
The DNS serves to match an easy to remember mnemonic (?nohats.ca?)
Unless the easy one was taken. Also: say that to all the non-ascii users!
Took quite a while before naver.com could even become ??.?. In fact there
isn't even a .?! Go figure!
That's a bit of a big statement ain't it?
Unless some nation (cough china cough) would decide they'd rather have
their own authority. I'd call this the biggest flaw in DNS history.
There go all the easy to remember names. See also "parked domains". You
love those don't you? Just imagine a ranking system wiping this form of

a different domain by my printer? Oh I shouldn't use my printer.
Thanks for nothing.
Except that those I trust I give my life to.
Sounds false. I am really bothered by discussing something based on wrong
axioms. You probably don't deserve my given amount of hate. Sorry about
this. But really, you expect too much from users, intermediates and
software especially. SSL has had trouble. DNSSEC will have trouble too.
It's not magical.
Yeah I don't really know what you meant by that.
DNSSEC is nice in that if you trust the root (or something closer by in the
chain) and the records are signed than you have a place to get an SSL
public key. That way you have two checkpoints, the server and the SSL chain
and the DNSSEC chain.
In practice I feel there'll be no great advantages because the signing
giants will be the same giants. Mostly American (wonder where they got
their initial funding!).

2013/11/25 Ralf Senderek I think the idea of a lockbox with one keyhole for locking it, and one for
opening it.
The one for closing it is the first half of the key for opening it. So it's
possible to make closing-keys from the opening key. (trying to make the
pubkey -> prikey process visual. It's not exactly accurate but it does
really work)
Now in the virtual world you can duplicate anything. So you can have as
many key-duplicates and box-duplicates as you would like. (implicit
explaination of copying isn't a bad thing.)
So it's a good idea to send everyone a duplicate of your close-key. That
way they can lock something for only you to read.
And if someone comes to your home and wants to be absolutely sure it's you,
they can ask you to use your openings key on one of your boxes! That way
whoever's name is on the keys and boxes can be made sure of.
And you should keep your close-key very safe, with it someone can pretend
to be you!
Anyway. The point is the analogy works in many cases.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Why prefer symmetric crypto over public key 
Public key depends on high level math. That math has some asymetric
property that we can use to achieve the public-private key relationships.
The problem is that the discovery of smarter math can invalidate the
asymetry and make it more symetrical. This has to do with P=NP, which is
also less trivial than a first explaination makes it seem. If it becomes
even effectively symetrical (P is that) it will stop having the nice
useable property.
Symetric cryptography does a much easier thing. It combines data and some
mysterious data (key) in a way that you cannot extract data without the
mysterious data from the result. It's like a + b = c. Given c you need b to
find a. The tricks that are involved are mostly about sufficiently mixing
data, to make sure there's enough possible b's to never guess it correctly
and that all those b's have the same chance of being the one b. Preferably
even when you have both A and C, but that's really hard.
So I'd say Bruce said that in an effort to move to more well understood
cryptography. It is also a way to move people towards simply better
algorithms, as most public key systems are very, very bad.

The problem is that a programmer (human) is not a processor (computer). A
programmer translates intent into processing steps. For me powerful means
expressive but also how much it resembles intent. In other words: how much
translating from idea to program.
C is not at all expressive. It's nearly assembly macro's. Maybe not nearly,
but you can still see the metal baselayer shining through.
It's always small mistranslations at a lower level. From SQL-injections to
buffer overflows to forgetting a "check security" statement.
It's like raindances, maybe. You want to have rain. You know you have to
raindance for rain. But if you curve your toe (too much) you get lightning.
That's only a problem in some cases (when it has to be safe), and then
you'll forget.
Aside from this, yes: a code checker will help in many cases. But code
checkers are not at all trivial, and they are no replacement for proper
code review and writing code in such a way that review would expose errors.
OpenSSL with only 1 reviewer definitely did not. Which is strange,
considering how important the project is.
I also feel a strong need for minimalism, to reduce possible problems and
make checking easier.
I also feel like using 3 different implementations and a sort of proxy
comparing the three outputs and only relaying if they are the same would be
a good idea. That way an exploit in a single *SSL will not turn into an

benefit most should give back, that is the logic on which such foundations
operate, if they don't ...
Should give back is not in the terms or lisence. Wishful thinking is faulty
logic, FreeBSD has and will suffer from it.
Social responsibilty is a marketing metric, nothing more. It has little
effect on Apple's profit and is therefore largely ignored. (Note: uproar
caused improvements, as it was risking impacting the baseline)
The dominant player in the mobile computing industry is, by the definition
of the word, not hipster. The word you're looking for is trendy, buy it is
not hip anymore.
Anyway. The point is that you cannot seriously expect an entity that
strives for nothing but profit to behave in a way that will reduce profit.
Given the low amount of cool people (people that prefer good things over
trendy things) companies don't usually behave in a cool way.
It would have been exceedingly easy for freebsd to protect the code from
being used in Mac. They conciously chose not to. So you feel like Apple
stole from FreeBSD, but it did not. FreeBSD decide that what Apple did is

very deserved.
There is many, many, many organizations out there that have millions lying
around. Even private people do.
Point in question is whether Apple deserves hate for not giving it to
FreeBSD. The answer is no. The FreeBSD people could have a GNU liscense, if
they wanted code back. They could limit free distribution to
"organizations/private persons for whom a million dollar donation dents

license or contribute part of profit, etc.

Most laptops right now provide those monotrackpads. Thing is that
synaptic's implementation sucks.  Those things are terrible. Apple
trackpads aren't terrible. Apple screens have always been extra good,
others are better off slicing 50/100e off the costs. Apple's software
compatibility is high due to their low diversity (high per-product sales).
The Ultrabook was not an original idea. It was there because Apple was
going into a direction that ChinaCo couldn't just brute force upon. So
Intel guided them into it.
Basically, if Apple is going to jump left then the rest of the world is
going to tumble after it. That's dominance if you ask me.
And did you know we have tablets now? Who came with that first, again?
Google is actually killing Apple's dominance by making affordable products.
Apple has always been comfortable in it's underdog position though, nothing
new there. They sell a brand more than they sell a computer. It's less
techchange dependent so it's granted them some sort of stability. If they
release a new nearly identical iPhone many people will still go for it.
They're pushing their luck by doing a worse job at getting better since
Jobs's gone. That's life. Whatever.
You're right in a way. They don't have the highest sales, probably not the
highest profit either.
Popular opinion can now invalidate argument? Hatred determines guilt? In
today's messed up world it isn't even a proper sidechannel. People's ethics
are tangled up over the web, the news outlets are insane with wild ethical
I really just can't see why this is wrong wrong. I can see why it's wrong.
Of course! They took something valuable, made good use out of it too. Made
MacOSX and iOS on it. And they don't give back at all!
But the need to give back.. Where does it come from? It's nice, makes us
feel fuzzy and warm inside, so to speak. It goes for nearly everyone that
giving back is justice, it's fair, it's honest, etc, etc. Not for everyone
though. And just because it's common doesn't mean you get it.
This is why I referred to Catch-22. Ethics packages are fine and dandy. But
in the end "they have the right because they can do it", which is what
Catch-22 was about, is all the ethical core that remains invariably. The
absurdity of Catch-22 was a way to talk to people about reality and
"reality". Words themselves don't even have meaning. Some ethics will make
you fail, invariably. And sometimes without them you fail as well.
Apple as a big large company has a different set of ethics. If Apple was a
person he'd probably be autistic and considered crazy. The thing is that
Apple is not a person. And that Apple's ethics do not include giving back
where it is not required.
So either it becomes required, or they won't do it. It can become required
by the amount of hate fired at Apple. So feel free to fire hate at Apple.
It will work, eventually. But the hatred does not have to have anything to
do with reality. It just has to disappear after Apple gives some money.
Reality is weird like that.
Anyway, I think Apple doesn't have to give back. I think so because
FreeBSD's people were given a good opportunity to declare in which way
people should give back. And they passed. They said "Nah, fuck it. We trust
in a commonality in ethics packages.". That was wrong. There is no way to
trust in "giving back" being part of peoples' ethics packages.
However, saying that it was a mistake implies there was no intent. And
intent is a feeling. A fuzzy thing. Maybe it's not a feeling, but It's not
a fact either. Even a declaration of intent does not make an intent
All that's factual is the actions. And the FreeBSD people performed the
action of explicitly (intentfully, you could even say) giving everyone
liberty to use and reuse without giving back.
So now Apple takes that liberty, as given expressly by FreeBSD, and it is
bad and evil? What the fuck?
Again, I get it. Okay. I get it. But it's just the thing that has this
world blundering into war after war, has brother kill brother, massacres,
shootings, rapes, financial abuse, slavery, unfair wealth distribution,
homelessness, creepiness, awkwardness, etc, etc, etc. It's all in this
common insanity. Assertions of ethics based solidly outside of reality, yet
inside everyone's minds.
Being able to somehow talk about it is what made Catch-22 such a special
book. But also somehow completely unsatisfactory. Like 1984 unable to
provide solutions, or even salvation. Just barely capable of putting this
common insanity problem into words. And where will it get us? How do we
address it?
We're addressing it, right now, right here, by having e-mail conversations
where we talk past each other. Where we dump symbols and have others parse
them differently than we intended, then give us answers that we will read
as an answer to our intentions.
Dominant in a market equaling market share, or not, causing me to be wrong
and (maybe!) right at the same moment and, as you said, causing me to make
a joke of myself.
Frankly there's too much confusion here, and I can get no relief.
There's more granularity possible than GNU has. Business was (and is)
eating up the world of software in a way that's not actually nice for
people that do software. GNU is a fully alternative approach, pretty much
incompatible with business. Bridging the difference is done by companies on
donations, which remain tricky and give less development force (see also:
Android and business suddenly turning on the afterburner), or with support,
which does not actually require developing the product.
So, what's the way that you can address the desires of the GNU people
(which are the right ones) and combine it with the sheer power to act that
business is all about? Certainly there's something there. I suspect we'll
be bickering about in-betweens for forever, and that nobody will ever be
able to truly communicate what we want and why, and that GNU and Closed
will both remain.
Somehow I think of capitalism as an obstacle for achieving what people
really want. I mean the people that develop and that consume. But at the
same time all things in capitalism are dependent directly upon desires (how
much is X worth is all eventually about desire). So the only conclusion is
that people's desires and/or awareness is out of whack. That's scary. Maybe
there's also something wrong with people desiring money and things that are
fictive, like the special coolness that a true Apple product could furnish

@_subject: [Cryptography] Browser JS (client side) crypto FUD 
Is surprisingly often passed around as if it is the end-all to the idea of
client side JS crypto.
TL;DR: It's a fantastic load of horse crap, mixed in with some extremely
generalized cryptography issues that most people never thought about before
that do not harm JS crypto at all.
I'm not sure why the guy wrote it. Maybe he's NSA motivated? Maybe he's
worked a lot on secure systems and this just gives him the creeps? Maybe
he's the kind of guy that thinks JS dynamic scripted languages
are not a real languages?
Somebody, please, give me something to say against people that claim JS
client side crypto can just never work!
Aside from that it's, well, fundamentally moronic to claim that something
is "harmful" when you actually means it does nothing, it's also just
(almost!) never true that no attacks are prevented.
But, let's go with the flow of the article. Rants won't really settle
Two example usages are given.
The first is client-side hashing of a password, so that it's never sent in
the clear. This is so legitimate it nearly makes me drop my hat, but, the
author decides to use HMAC-SHA1 instead of SHA2 for reasons that are fully
beyond me. Perhaps just trying to make things less secure?
The second is using AES keys to client side encrypt. The author must've
thought he was being helpful when he imagined the scheme for this. Or maybe
he was drunk. "So you generate an AES key for each note, send it to the
user's browser to store locally, forget the key, and let the user wrap and
unwrap their data.". Somehow trusting the transport layer is all back in
vogue. The only key-generation problem in JS is entropy, which is a problem
everywhere tbh. If you really want to ensure entropy, send a random data
blob and XOR it with whatever client-side best-shot at randomness.
The author bluntheadedly claims "They will both fail to secure users". In
principle I agree, his methods sucked balls. He, however, blames it on JS.
Okay.. Let's go on.
REALLY? WHY?
Until those problems are fixed, Javascript isn't a serious crypto research
(points numbered for pointwise addressing)
1 - Yeah. Duh. What do you think of delivering anything client side?
There's the whole SSL infrastructure, if that doesn't cut it for you, well,
welcome to the Internet. (I suggest the next article is about how the
Internet is fundamentally flawed.) I would suggest, however, that once your
delivery pathway is exploited you're fundamentally screwed in every way.
You can't communicate anything, you can't authenticate anyone, you really
can't *do* anything! So let's leave out the "Javascript" part of this
point, and just do whatever we're already doing to alleviate this issue.
2 - This is a conclusion without any basis so far (aside from being..
meaningless to a computer scientist. Hostile?)
3 - Then just look at what data was transferred. Does every crypto
application require checkable source? Is any SSL implementation "considered
harmful" because nobody is able to flawlessly read the code, no compilers
are trusted, etc?
Okay so that chapter meant absolutely nothing. The author goes on to try to
defend his brabble:
"WHAT'S THE "CHICKEN-EGG PROBLEM" WITH DELIVERING JAVASCRIPT CRYPTOGRAPHY?
If you don't trust the network to deliver a password, or, worse, don't
trust the server not to keep user secrets, you can't trust them to deliver
security code. The same attacker who was sniffing passwords or reading
diaries before you introduce crypto is simply hijacking crypto code after
you do."
A fair point against a single thread model. Interestingly the last line
does absolutely not have to hold, sniffing (after the fact) and on-the-fly
rewriting are worlds apart. Take Tempest of Xkeyscore, for example, they
can't do rewrites. They need specialized programs for that. (Conclusion:
nope, nothing to see here)
The next chapter tries to justify the fallacies made earlier on. Equating a
rewrite to a read, ad-homineming the JS crypto "industry" (and failing to
distinguish operational security from actual security), and lastly claiming
that misplaced trust is bad (which is obvious and unrelated).
The next chapter claims SSL is safe, and "real" crypto unlike JS crypto.
Then firmly cements his baseless ridicule by claiming that if you use
non-JS crypto to make JS crypto work, then obviously there's no point.
The next chapter "WHAT'S HARD ABOUT DEPLOYING JAVASCRIPT CRYPTO CODE OVER
SSL/TLS?" claims all the page has to be SSL/TLS and that makes it hard.
It's not hard and you should already be doing it to have /*any*/ security.
Not to mention it's not true, only that interpreted as page contents has to
be SSL'ed (eg, images don't need to be transported over SSL).
So, point 1 has no merit against JS whatsoever. There's also a lot of
FUD-like text that denies reality. Especially the assumption that SSL and
desktop programs are somehow more secure.
So point 2.
(letterized for pointwise addressing)
"HOW ARE BROWSERS HOSTILE TO CRYPTOGRAPHY?
In a dispriting variety of ways, among them:
a - The prevalence of content-controlled code.
b - The malleability of the Javascript runtime.
c - The lack of systems programming primitives needed to implement crypto.
d - The crushing weight of the installed base of users.
Each of these issues creates security gaps that are fatal to secure crypto.
Attackers will exploit them to defeat systems that should otherwise be
secure. There may be no way to address them without fixing browsers."
a, c, d are, at first sight, all rubbish. b is a very genuine point
however. With prototyping and the like it can be VERY hard to see what's
going on. It's an often mentioned thing about JS that it's too powerful in
some ways, and it can be true. The same goes for C and memory control.
Next chapter confirms that a is rubbish.
Chapter after that explains some basic Comp Sci about when you can trust
something (and discredits something that can help in a lot of cases, any if
you do it correctly (which is too hard))
Chapter after that rehashes the idea that you can't trust the environment
unless you trust the whole environment, which is also the same everywhere.
(I also refer to trusting the compiler)
Next chapter is titled "WELL THEN, COULDN'T I WRITE A SIMPLE BROWSER
EXTENSION THAT WOULD ALLOW JAVASCRIPT TO VERIFY ITSELF?". And guess what,
the author agrees. You can indeed do this. If you're just doing it for
yourself or a single kind of crypto you could also make a plugin for that.
Which is what the WhatWG is doing with the HTML5 crypto extension. Then
claims crypto is to PGP as programming languages are to Lisp, which is
The author then goes on to actually talk about random generators. Which are
not always required, but who cares, right? Then Secure erase, which is only
important if you expect the client device to be exploited. Then ?timing
attacks? which is even more specific and can be alleviated easily enough.
Then tries to generalize his claim to remove JS specifically from the
equation, removing is last viable (but not definitive) arguments.
Some hating on key management, which is justified but again bullocks wrt
the main argument. (not to mention it's a problem everywhere, and it can be
solved like everywhere)
Some hate on people running old browsers, which has actually been solved by
background-auto-updating by now. (huzzah for all the added insecurity there)
Then something about graceful degrading. Which is fair except for him not
sufficiently providing any reason JS crypto never works. (and not
relevant). He apparently meant this with d. Depends greatly on the
deployment situation, but in general it's FUD.
"AND WHEN YOU SAID "VIEW-SOURCE TRANSPARENCY WAS ILLUSORY"?
We meant that you can't just look at a Javascript file and know that it's
secure, even in the vanishingly unlikely event that you were a skilled
cryptographer, because of all the reasons we just cited."
Yeah. Welcome to programming. There's absolutely no truth to this claim
btw. Vagely referring to a large body of rubbish is not an argument.
The rest does not even try to take a direct shot anymore. Something about
how users that use 100 programs are more likely to find an insecure one
than people that use only 2 or 3.
He's the kind of guy that claims cracking and rewriting SSL connections is
easy, whereas using AES for a secure "cryptosystem" is hard. I don't know
what's up with this guy.

Only the following alinea is the TL;DR of my response, as I noticed it got
quite long. It's a bit of a convention, but apparently not one to trust.
I'm really having a hard time finding any other reason. If you Google
"Javascript cryptography" you get that article as a first hit, not a crypto
library. If there's any truth to the NSA manipulating Google results (why
wouldn't they?) to improve national security, and I'm sure they do that by
preventing a wildgrowth of JS crypto, then maybe he still didn't write it
for the NSA, but they sure did support it.
Does it really matter if he's part of them? The point is he is helping them.
What does all the crypto even mean? It's not possible because secure
application delivery depends on crypto. But that's a totally different
claim, which goes for any sort of application. That way it's a strawman at
It's popular enough to be kept up-to-date. The 2008 was meant as a "way in
the past" kind of date. The waybackmachine first dates it in September 2011
10 years after SHA2 was standardized. (It may be older, too)
Windows XP is an argument against JS crypto? Just deny them access to your
website. Put up "I'm sorry, your safety cannot be guaranteed while using
this site because you use an outdated browser or operating system. Click
here to continue unsafely.". If they still do it it's not your frikkin'
problem. There's just no way to solve it.
A bit of a distraction IMHO. "In some situations some things don't work", I
fully agree with that.
This is a choice made by the webdevs. HTTPS has value even in a mixed
environment. But obviously it wouldn't be a secure environment.
They're occasionally valid and therefore do not support the article's claim.
You can recreate the issues in any other language, it's just harder to
code. The ease of coding something (in an way that may not be secure) is
not a strong argument for saying it's impossible to code something
securely. Only if you would do it wrong by accident, which is not really
the case IMHO.
I responded somewhat to that above, but there is another issue here. I
Again, this is a coder's mistake that can be easily avoided. MITB attacks
are no different from Man in the OS attacks, and can therefore be discarded
from the discussion.
Yes and no. Webapplication signing like application signing would be neat
and could be a plugin or webstandard. In general I'm against plugins, it
just means you're not really doing HTML anymore.
It depends on the thread model, but in general: yes!
If you can't deal with this there's no helping any software becoming
insecure. Again, just not a JS problem.
Perhaps SVG has some intense features, but I'm pretty sure that  this as trying to address the devil you know vs the devil you don't.
You do realize that this still has absolutely nothing to do with whether or
not JS in the browser is, by definition, "Considered Harmful". The sheer
pretentiousness of the title, "It is considered harmful", it should be "I
consider JS crypto harmful". They're pushing so hard to level with goto's
are considered harmful, but there's no meat in the arguments.
Finding more specific cases in which, indeed, a system that includes JS
crypto fails, does not help at all.
Unless you can tell me that for some reason you agree with  "JS Crypto
Considered Harmful" but not with "Crypto Considered Harmful", tell me. And
while you're at it, tell me about a singular piece of silicon valley
software (dropbox, evernote, skype, (android? it's not made there but by
the same attitude,) etc.) that uses cryptography such that you would not
consider it harmful.
Let's say you're writing a C program. You decide that it'd be a great idea
to dynamically link a library. That's not so unusual, people do it all the
time. But, you decide to link not a library on the system, but a library
that's hosted at " (URI dynamic linking
could be a new feature in GCC5). Is C cryptography now considered harmful?
Actually, dynamic linking on the system itself suffers the same problems
still. Did you ever link to OpenSSL? Very foolish, totally exploited.
Also "content-controlled" is a really poor way to express what is meant.
The content is not in control any more than it is in other languages. It's
just easier to include code. And that's a good thing.
Sure, Content Security Policy headers someday might address this, or at
No, they don't protect you from including bad code into your project.
It's a choice you don't have to make. Including foreign code as is done
quite frequently is immensely unsafe, and I doubt anyone would deny that.
But it would be unsafe with anything else, too. The level of dynamicness
makes an attack much easier, but then remove the dynamicness and you're
fine again.
It might be an idea to have "link hashes". When I place a URI then the data
pulled through it (the whole set of data) should have a certain hash. So
 becomes . But we don't have these, so
just control what you link towards, k?
Dependency Check to make sure that you 3rd party libraries that do not
Yep. This seems like a good idea. Signatures, too, could help. Thing is
that it hasn't really been a priority for the W3C or WhatWG to increase
security. Especially as the NSA would stop it's indirect funding if they
did that (joke, but wouldn't that be interesting?).
I agree. It horrifies me. For privacy, too, it's terrible. Usually referrer
headers are sent and the host knows what I'm browsing. Google hosts
especially many free items online, libraries, fonts and even DNS, and I
don't imagine Google wastes such good sources of profiling information.
I just serve the libraries from my own server over HTTPS. That's the best
available practice atm AFAIK.
It does never fail to make me more interested in Lisp, which I guess is the
real point anyway.
But they are based off of things that PGP is based off. And diversity also
has value.  is of great relevance here :)
Yeah that was just dishing out the hate..
I believe they already do for things like blockchain.info. It's still a lot
more specific, which helps a wee bit. And it will drive up projects like
the Chrome Web Store.
There's a difference in severity, a few users (that didn't have their
system in order) versus all users if the server gets cracked. But I think
that passwords will fail before the key management does, or else the
passwords can compliment the key management.
I'll use AES for encrypting the asymetric keys, and store the ciphertext
serverside. I believe everyone does it that way. The bottleneck is the
password entered (and maybe remembered) by the user's system.
I investigated and was shocked at the amount of people that still use XP.
It seems like a good 15 to 20%.
Reminds me of the Linux distro that's made to look like XP. Didn't get far
enough, but seems like a pretty good idea right now. Sadly, those <20%
wouldn't find out about this Linux XP and they wouldn't do anything to get
an upgrade.
Maybe a sort of I love you virus for XP would be more effective.
Everyone using Windows runs from the admin account. UAC was a big flop
because user-access-rights are not really a native concept for Windows
users. They should've gone the Android road, giving applications limited
rights instead of giving users limited rights.
OS auto-updates don't work well because they are, in fact, very annoying.
Especially the "reboot in 4 hours" thing that can't be seen when someone
runs a full-screen application, then suddenly interrupts a game or a movie
for rebooting. Really insane.
Microsoft's failures aside, I was referring to browser auto updates. Chrome
updates completely silently, you can't notice if it updated without seeing
differences (UI changes) or checking the version number. Mozilla followed
suit. Now browsers are either of a pre-silent-auto-update era, or they're
up to date.
I checked if that's actually true. netmarketshare.com tells us that in the
last month people have been using FF30 and FF29 about equally much. Since
FF30 was release 10 June that quite makes sense. FF28 is not on the chart.
Chrome is tighter, just version 35. Then there's the miserable Internet
Explorer. Since they started trying to make a real browser they've been
losing the browser war less. They still really suck and ruin the industry
Deployment's messy. But you can just tell people "nope, upgrade first". The
old-tech slackers aren't the good customers anyway (are they?).
The other relevant issue here is that I would speculate that they there are
Let's not talk about competence! A big problem nowadays is that so many
coders are so barely competent. They make mistakes they shouldn't. It's not
even really their fault, coding is hard and most people are of normal
intelligence. With the extreme lack in capable coders, less capable coders
are employed. That causes a lot of grief. A lot more products, and most of
that lot are bad products. Crypto quality is usually the first to suffer.
Either way, I think we agree on all points. Just use a different framing. I
say "It's hard to do right, but it's not impossible" and then you say "but
it really is hard". I agree that JavaScript does not have much in the way
of security technology, that it is lacking. I even agree with JavaScript
being an easy language to cut yourself in the fingers with (dynamic
environments and all). The RNG problems have been mostly addressed, most
others will be in time.
JavaScript cryptography is possible, there are usecases, and it is
*definitely* *not *"considered harmful" by default.

Ah, but HTTPS works better against passive attacks then against active
attacks! If there are cracks, as you're using a weak ciphersuite for
example, then still cracking takes time. If it's too much time your attack
will be *very* noticable. If there's a 5 minute time until any HTTPS
website first loads (the time it takes "them" to crack it) and HTTP
websites load just fine, you'll know what time it is.
So, most attacks against SSL/TLS would be offline! But if there's attacks
it should only reveal you JS crypto outputs. They couldn't rewrite the
document (the JS) because their attack is "passive".
SO: Use the "safe for a minute" HTTPS connection to deliver the JS that
makes it practically uncrackable after delivery.

I'm afraid that not even our chips can provide any guarantees anymore. It's
mostly (entirely?) because they have grown so complex. The question is how
to have "secure bottlenecks", behind which complexity can exist without
causing any harm.
I don't consider my physical safety to be very high. Maybe that's a
mistake, but anyone could knock in my windows (double glass is hardly any
stronger than single glass) and break whatever physical security I have.
Breaking my computer/software stuff takes real skill. I'm not so very high
value (yet) so nobody would expose his/her capabilities hacking me.
At least, that's the general reasoning. I will have to increase my security
gradually as my getting-hacked value increases. And it really worries me. I
don't know how to increase security very far. So little of the stack is
trusted. Actually nothing in the stack is trusted. It's like getting
entropy without randomness, it just isn't there. The CPU itself, with it's
remote administration, the motherboard, with it's build-in ethernet port,
the macrokernel OS with it's binary drivers, etc, etc.
What's worse is that security is immeasurable, the cost of a loss of
security is unclear, etc. How can I justify buying something that's
obviously worse for everything except security?
Single sign on has the potential for being a fantastic measure for identity
and security online. The way it's done now quite the opposite is happening.
Integration of services causes security woes. Fallback upon e-mail is still
a crazy anti-account-capture-measure that's nonetheless very effective.
Your musing is heard and agreed with. In sorrow I must say that we are in
quicksand up to our noses, and most people like it down here. If we are to
get out it will be a very painfull, very long process.

Adoptation is another issue. You can have a faster-growing blockchain fork,

validating according to the given rules. This is what happens every time
Bitcoin switches to a newer protocol.
These protocols can have sufficient overlap that some transactions go into

it's been avoided so far.

It's easy if you only have to use it. Those things not intertwined with
N=NP, entropy, signal-to-noise ratio's, and 100% correctness are typically
just as important for a good application, but a LOT easier to produce to an
acceptable level of correctness.
P.S.: Good piece! I'd like to add three:
Myth  Bitcoin is inherently Democratic or at least more democratic than
usual money
Fact: Bitcoin is plutocratic, controlled by the wealthy
When people speak of Bitcoin "voting" they usually refer to the mayority of
hashing power agreeing on something. The one who owns the most hashing
power invested the most money (Bitcoin or otherwise) into Bitcoin mining
hardware. No other conditions exist but to have a lot of money to be able
to win a vote. A cheaper alternative is mining-pools, which centralize the
vote to the owner of the pool. It is true, nowadays, that mayority is so
expensive that the amount of wealthy that could singlehandedly break
Bitcoin is decreasing. Yet, even when there isn't anyone who could do it
singlehandedly all choices are still made by voting with wealth, not voting
per person.
Usual money is dictated by the people elected by "the people", at least
that's what the wrapper reads. If you're as worried about the correct
functioning of "the democratic system" as I am you wouldn't like to use the
word democratic anymore. But, certainly, the Euro is more democractic than
Bitcoin. The Dollar is about the same (neither the FED nor the global
people take orders from USGOV). Many national currencies will be more
democratic than the Euro, simply because every individual person has
greater influence over it. If everyone were equally wealthy Bitcoin would
be democratic, the less equally wealthy people are the less democratic
Bitcoin is. There's some people out there that can buy whole cities, and
employ their people. So Bitcoin, not very democratic. But democracy, was
that really what you were looking for?
Myth  It's too late to get in and reap huge profits (I can not be an
"early adaptor" anymore)
Fact: Bitcoin's value is arbitrary, based upon nothing and limited by
If nothing goes wrong adaption will steadily grow and the price will
fluctuate depending on market liquidity, which can be arbitrarily low.
(Note: supply/demand refers to how many people are selling, how many people
are buying, not to actual supply or anthing.) Without any organization to
smooth over those fluctuations Bitcoin can crash (fully) one day and rise
to mighty hights (the sky is no limit) the next. Just because Bitcoin was
once x and is now 100x, doesn't mean that it can't be 10000x. Do you think
Bitcoin has reached it's maximum adoption? Me nether.
Note: Bitcoin's price does not have to climb. I think the biggest risk is a
superior altcoin, as all the rest does not truly kill Bitcoin (there is
always a purpose).
Myth  A 51% attack is very, very bad.
Fact: no invalid transactions can be inserted into the blockchain ever.
That would make it a different blockchain that is not accepted by
"standard" Bitcoin clients.
Fact: the greater the attack's hashing power, the higher the chance he
might be able to double spend. It is possible (but increasingly less
likely) to double spend with less than >50% hashingpower.
Fact: above 51% an attack is able to alter the order of transactions, and
is thus able to "alter history". That means he might spend money /again/,
while undoing his other previous spending (you cannot spend money twice).
We call this a double spending attack
Many think that having 51% allows you to do anything with the blockchain.
The blockchain only timestamps transactions relatively to eachother, and
relative to GMT in a non-trivial manner. The need for that is great because
of this: I can write two people a check for the sum of my grandmother's
savings account. The first person to go to the bank gets the money, the
other's check bounces. Before they reached the bank both might consider
themselves paid (and they kind of are, in a fractional reserve way). This
is why it's called "double spending". In Bitcoin the bank is replaced by
the blockchain, first in the blockchain gets the coin. If someone is able
to change who was the first, he can change who got the money.
The real trick with being an attacker is making sure that person 1 felt
like he was paid (he cashed his check) and did something for you. Then
after he cannot reverse what he did you alter the blockchain, causing
person 2 to be paid instead of person 1. Person 2 is the attacker, and
person 1 was tricked.
Finally, the blockchain is build up out of different blocks referring one
another. Per processingpower unit spend you have a certain chance
(lotterylike chance) to be able make a block, this chance is ensured
through cryptographic means. That means that someone might get a block even
whilst not having significant hashing power. This has tricked some people
in the past. It may also happen that two people find a block pretty much at
the same time, then two different blocks are validly the longest chain. One
has to wait for one of the two to become longer than the other to know
which one is valid. This can take many blocks to happen, as much as 4 has
The lesson is that you should wait for a few confirmations before you can
consider a transaction legitimate. If there's a stronger attacker you
should wait longer. At 50% you might have to wait forever, but you are more
likely to win or lose eventually. Above 50% you are more likely to never
win, the attack might even rewrite history if he attempts to generate a
longer chain than has already happened.
You can easily calculate if it's worthwhile for an attacker to rewrite your
transaction. Only if they really hate you would an attacker lose more money
than he makes,

I do not, at all, think that's fair.
It is some sort of indication of:
    * how unprofitable mining would suddenly become if the blockreward
would dissapear
    * how expensive transactions would be if miners would still demand
payment (read: how Bitcoin would suddenly die if that happened)
    * how Bitcoin is "fractional reserve" in a way, only if people put in
what we call "market cap" would others be able to get it out. It's more or
less like fractional reserves in that not everyone can get "his money" out.
    * how disproportionate the current mining efforts are to the value of a
And that last one is just as intended and a good feature. In a way you can
say that your fee buys you security, by buring your transaction under a
certain amount of hashes. Now there is money out of nowhere paying for a
whole load (maybe around 60x) more security than you paid for. That's a
good thing because Bitcoin is (used to be?) kind of small and thus
hackable, and is now (maybe around 60x) less hackable.
The question of who pays for that is peculiar as it seems in many ways as
if money comes out of nowhere. The complexity of supply and demand does not
nessarily change the value (although supply might correlate with amount in
existence) of the coins as they increase in quantity. I would say that
"newcomers" that push the price compensate for the pulling of the price
caused by selloffs through mining. The truth is miners are purchasing new
coins from nobody, not affecting supply/demand directly and securing the
network through it. It's a very good choice for Bitcoin. So good that you'd
almost like to make a coin stable versus hashing power.
And what's worse: this does not depend upon any one transaction at all.
And what's better: this means that by your account the Bitcoin transaction
price is expected to regularly drop *dramatically*!
I think you should add the cost of developing software for Bitcoin, if you
take initial coin distribution into account. And to think that the price
ends up being similar to a bank transfer!

I didn't use another word because they didn't cover the load.
I think you should also consider the entire machine that the banking world
consists off. I'm pretty sure that the machine is thusly complex and so
intertwined with the very method of accounting (money) that it is
absolutely unthinkable to create a fair estimation of the cost of a single
transaction, even whilst taking immense liberties. The whole financial
crisis with people speaking of "evaporating money" are a fantastic example
of the complexity of the issue.
The government, with it's many interferences, also contributes vastly to
the cost of maintaining the banking system. Every policeman (greatly,
especially in it's size and threateningness) contributes to the
maintainance of the law, which contributes to the maintanance of the
banking systems. What about the cost in lives over wars fought for the sake
of money?
It just cannot, absolutely cannot, be measured how big an expenditure we
make so that everything in our society is measurable and expressable in a
financial unit ! That's not to say it's not worth it, I dare say I don't
belive the USSR did well enough to compensate for western spending to their
detriment (interesting topic to research but I didn't). And I also dare say
that nobody has tried any differently in the modern age.
Bitcoin, if succesfully implemented, will dramatically shift but absolutely
not retire all these expenses. In fact it may, through it's extreme
objectivity in accounting, be unable to smooth over the troubles of society
and thusly result in very far increased costs. But we gain things too. We
will have truth, liberty, and some crazy sort of objective justice, all of
which have been fought and died for, causing immeasurable costs.
So, simply put, think it's not fair at all to account Bitcoin transaction
costs like that.
I mostly agree with this. It is fully intentional that the network will pay
for the security of the network. Many say "it's still cheaper than banks".
NXT seems more promising, although less pure in some ways.
The question of consensus is a philosophical one. Is a mayority, full
agreement, agreement of involved parties, etc, consensus? We always appoint
either a person, a board, a committee, a bank, a government, anything or
anyone just to tell us what's right. We stick to exceedingly simple systems
for this, with central points of authority. Bitcoin cleverly distributed
the point of authority over the computingpower involved, fuzzing the line
between rule of the wealthy, rule of the public and democracy. Ultimately I
think NXT has the same ruling class, but encoded more honestly.
NXT is trying to be more than it has to be, however, which might cause
significant problems down the road.
Did I mention Bitcoin is actually just a decentralized ledger, and this
whole financial bullshit is actually a mere single implementation that
seemed like it'd be a good one? Mastercoin knows this, and abuses it for
what it really is. Namecoin showed it too, although differently.
NXT merges finance and consensus even further.

The security factor will decrease. The unrewritability of the ledger
depends fully upon the costs of writing it since the ledged thing was
introduced. You can bury information under a pile of cash. If you swap the
pile (regenerate the blockchain) you have to pay for it. So if the % of
money spent on mining decreases, the time until a certain certainty is
achieved increases (if mining costs decrease tenfold (miningcosts/10) then
instead of 3 blocks for X money you need to wait for 30 blocks). It'll
still work, just less well.
It now works ridiculously well. The bigger the network the smaller the
average transaction compared to the network, and how higher the "security
Obviously people have to pay the miners, most directly this can be done
through transactions. The added benefit is being able to tax annoying
actions, like "transaction dust" or hard-to-compute transactions.
It's also a thing that you have to create money out of nowhere in a limited
fasion. Blockrewards are one of those lightning-strike-genuis things where
you can distribute money and increase adaption in a single strike. They are
the only way money enters the system, and it enters more towards people
that help the network be more secure. It's very elegant.
I think there's still the fact that they're a most essential key in
businesses. Getting rewards for certain code features isn't so bad either.
Truth is, for most purposes code monkeys are laborers. Not unlike painters
in a certain era. There's some masterworkers, but most just learned how to
scribble in a way that entertains the masses... Masterworkers pick their
work, though. And they are not usually rewarded properly.

@_subject: [Cryptography] [cryptography] How big a speedup through storage? 
2014-06-20 21:46 GMT+02:00 Greg Zaverucha :
This is pretty basic. It's become common knowledge, apparently a valueable
paper then :). This one is a little more archaic than my current timespan
allows me to process properly.
It's also important to remember that whatever tricks will be used they are
most likely not public knowledge.
Ah yes, rainbow tables :) I remember making one for MD5 in school with PHP
and MySQL. Worked decently, but not enough storage/preprocessing time to
really get further than those available for free online. Good fun though.
PHP is very easy to just use. I think mine wasn't as good as it could've
been if I'd had proper references. No way to dig it up though.
Some funny stuff here too; "They present a detailed analysis which is
backed up by simulation in a purpose-built FPGA.". What is a purpose-built
FPGA? FPGA's are adaptable, that's the whole point! If it were purpose
built it'd be an ASIC, and not an FPGA at all. Nice paper, but already more
or less "common knowledge".
First line hits home "There is a widespread myth that parallelizing a
computation cannot improve its price-performance ratio.". The term
price-performance is accurate, but price no longer means what it should for
the scale of the agency concerned. It's more about humanly possible, I
It's interesting that the whole paper comes no futher than showing that the
myth does not hold true. That's good, but it does not go as far as it could
at all.
It also has a more general comment;" ?*But 256-bit AES deliberately uses 14
rounds to keep us secure against non-brute-force attacks!? some people will
argue. ?There?s an 8-round attack taking time only 2 204 , for example.
Okay, okay, that?s on a machine with 2 104 bits of memory, but maybe some
additional ideas will produce a 10-round attack more efficient than a
256-bit parallel brute-force key-search attack.? *". It is my understanding
that the rounds are required for diffusing the input. Using less rounds
than a certain threshold fails to achieve sufficient blending of the input,
and creates strong patterns in the output. In other words: it completely
breaks diffusion. Therefore the detriment to the security factor of AES is
much stronger than is suggested in this alinea, as patterns arise where
there previously weren't.
The type of attack that I see the most profit in would be one that adopts a
variant of a "meet in the middle" attack. It moves away futher from the
centralized point of execution. We have a function family generator F(key,
step) that can create a function to be performed on a cyphertext C(step),
where key is a random-walk-value used in the attempted decryption and the
step is a "class". The function will only execute on programs with the
right class. F's results are compared to succesfully completed decryptions,
possibly seeded with foreknowledge.
F is supposed to generate/consist of functions that find patterns or
perform mutations. In a serial machine this would be completely unfeasible,
not unlike Neural Network simulation is uninteresting. But in this parallel
machine "transient" paths will be untangled by converging on a nearby
physical location. IOW: the result of a function generated by F determines
the next function to be executed, and the functions are mapped out over the
machine. The machine will thus automatically bring similar results closer
together which allows for deduplication. If one is able to deduplicate with
a known-decypherment then a more serial/central process is supposed to take
note of that, and test a key coming forth from that or at least shift the
probability of working with a certain class of keys (that share a property
extracted by the functions).
This is a meet in the middle attack because in the end there will have to
be brute forcing, but the intermediate results are an optimization of it.
Additionally there will be many "middle points" floating around the machine
at any given point in time.
This is not the whole story however. The really interesting trick is that
many different cyphertexts will propagate through the machine at the same
time. Not only are middlepoints matched within a certain cyphertext, but
also across multiple cyphertexts. This could be especially interesting when
the key is (partially) shared.
The really hard thing is the construction of F. F will have to generate
functions with an understanding of how patterns should arise given certain
steps, and how they shouldn't. There's an advantage to integrating common
plaintexts, as their mutations should leave a certain pattern. Etc. etc. I
could go on and try to work this out, I don't have time now.
Short: There may be patterns between different decodings. There is ways
that a parallel computation does not need longer-term memory to store
intermediate results, and that could be much faster. There is potentially
profit in decoding many messages truly simultaneously. There is less
research into parallel algorithms than in sequential algorithms, so we
might just not know so well. There may be heuristic manners in intermediate
AES decodings that we have not yet found. Etc.
I'm more interested in finding out how well it's been thought trough than
in rambling about transcendent patterns and wild ideas as I did above. It's
interesting to think of how to solve hard problems, but really hard to
communicate (that's why papers are so hard to read) and to prove/test
(that's why papers need to be so hard to read) a theory. Let alone actually
do it! But the agency has a history of doing just that, without anybody
outside the agency knowing about it.
If indeed the agency would like to spend so much on so complicated a
machine then it would prefer to lift part of it's veil then to let
speculation run wild. If Area 51 was publicly exposed to be a ridiculously
expensive airplane-testing facility then it wouldn't be so interesting, and
discussion would be about the price not "alien technology in aircraft". To
use an analogy: the trick of good magicians isn't that they hide their
movement so well, it's that they divert attention from the movements. If
the agency hadn't leaked to use that they want a sort of Tempest (UK
program keeping all Internet traffic for 3 days) we would be lyrical and
frantic about what's going to happen in that facility.
Let's consider something else it might be. Maybe we'll learn something
about crypto just trying to see how they'd want to do it!  :)

Hell, why not just use some pre-DES standard. Hardly any people out there
would know how to use Differential Cryptanalysis. Since nobody will ever

@_subject: [Cryptography] On mobile passwordless logins and established 
I'm just waiting for the deterministic secret. That way I can regenerate my
secret at any time, anywhere!
This exposes a fundamental useability thingy. People like to carry their
identity in their brains. It gives me the jeepers thinking I'd forget my
password, but theft worries me at least as much. If I lose my brain you can
pretty much shoot me (or I'll become a rockstar or something), if I lose my
phone I just buy a new one (how terribly first world of me).
Also having the same certificate is not ideal.
Having a bluetooth like pairing thingy where you keep on pairing your new
device with old ones could generate a little network of trust. You could
extend this to a government override, as the government still has the final
say on who's who. If you feel icky yet, that's because you realized how
easy it is for crypto to be defiled by real world situations. Anyway, your
"base certificate" could be deterministic, and never stored anywhere.
That way what's in your brain is the root certificate. All the rest is just
a paired device. Paired to the crypto in your brain.
A blockchainish approach would be required to definitely unlicense a
certain device. In fact namecoin is an ideal candidate for registering and
deauthorizing such public identities. Then a police report could
effectively de-auth and that would solve the problem when someone forgot
his deterministic source key (dummy!).
Alternatively an implanted chip or even just a portable digipassport-device
could be distributed by a company. Even better would be a chorus of
companies with a shamir's secret sharing like arangement, but let's not get
into policies before the tech is laid out!
To bootstrap this mechanism a LastPass like software (company) will bridge
the situation until it becomes commonplace to have fancy-pants-no-password
authentication. Maybe a little pincode would unlock the device for high-sec
thingies and every week or so (also to help the memory ;).
Once the policies are worked out (whatever they might become) this will
beat the password once and forever. Devices will be auth tokens, disabling
them will be like disabling a credit card.
Measure must be implemented to prevent central control over identity itself.

One might prevent the scheduler from kicking in for as long as the crypto
program is running.
One may also use a minimalistic (read: raspberry/arduino) device to do the
crypto. Then, too, is using registers a safer way of doing things.
Given OP is already poking through GCC I suspect the level of hardcoreness
might be high enough to warrant the use of a minimalistic CPU as a
coprocessor for crypto. This has other advantages too, the greatest being
that the OS/Computer cannot access the crypto data or otherwise influence
it's computation.
Of course, all depends on what's what.
You could recompile the whole OS without the use of some registers. You'd
take a performance hit. Programs will still be able to access the sacred
registers. You'd have to lift the crypto into the kernel to avoid regular
programs doing it. Then the kernel can still f with you, but it can always
f with you. (That's why microkernels are secretly better)

Actually, if you put a hash in the Blockchain that's pretty great too.
The alternative is not having payment for it, or having a trusted party

Yes and no, precision of language can be greater and smaller. It's much
overlooked. I find especially computer-related law lacks precision. I also
find that precise law is essential, lest it is not law at all. We also see
that the "intention of the lawmaker" is an important factor.
Finally, we even see laws that depend upon interpretation yet to be given
by judges that may oppose directly. Often we see "fundamental law", eg
human rights, opposing more readily changed law. And the readily changed
law wins easily if polticians interpreted laws in ways that make it simple.

There's typically a low bandwidth and there's precious little entropy in it
(only non-engineered spam can count as entropy). Using hashes you can just
throw more and more information at it, some if it is bound to stick.
The question is, why not just hash the entire memory? Then just stream all
the inputs into arrays (% arraylength; ring arrays), and voila, absolute
maximum entropy collected.
Hashing the entire memory can be extremely parallel. Even just a kernel
modification that marks un-rehashed blocks, and partially rebuilds a
hash-tree dynamically (based on oldest changed memory block) would be
guaranteed to collect all that good stuff. The block size and rehash
rate(s) could be adjusted for better performance. To ensure/enlarge entropy
carry-over you can include the previous memory-block-hash into the next
memory-block-hash. You can even dynamically decide to rehash more marked
blocks when more entropy is being consumed from /dev/random or
how many bits of entropy are actually squeezed out of the system, but it's
totally possible. And (in instant-rehash mode) guaranteed to be the most
entropy one can squeeze out of a system.
It's not the most efficient, but it might very likely beat the mail-log
tactic in terms of bits-of-entropy-obtained/computing-resources-eaten.

As long as they can check a digital signature (wouldn't try internet
without it..) they could check the signature of a blob of random data. That
would have to be supplied from a not-so-starved source, which should be
possible over an internet of things.
That said, the TV probably has the most entropy of any household item,
given the incoming data quantity. White noise anyone? And lightbulbs
probably the least. Or else doorbells?
Regarding just-booted entropy, save some for later on a disk? There's also
initial entropy to be scraped: temperatures, RAM state, last digits of the
clock (hash of clockvalues), serial numbers, installed software packages,
tempfiles, last edited files (browser history), etc. All hashed together.
It works especially well since a real life hack requires actually knowing
many if not (nearly) all those values. Predictable isn't a big deal if it's
just too hard to predict. That idea breaks the idea of "bits of entropy
equivalent" until you've modeled an adversary and guessed the probabilities
of the adversary knowing of certain values.
Real time protocols might gain no entropy at all from sampling the clock,
whereas long term storage (many years) there can definitely be bits of
entropy to be found.

asserting P!=NP is a prerequisite for all crypto, but it isn't proven.
If you do assert P!=NP then you're still stuck without method to determine
if, for operation F, there exists no method that inverts F that's in P. If
you'd have the proof for P!=NP you might be able to extend that proof,
somehow relate to it.
But we haven't ever found the proof for P!=NP (if it even exists).
So in short, yeah, pretty much true for all crypto. I'm not aware of any
proofs that assert something to be at least very expensive but within P,
but that *could *make it possible to prove a cryptographic algorithm. The
problem is that anything within P is, well, really much worse than our
"probably NP" algorithms seem to be. It means you'll expend a lot more
effort while encrypting and decrypting compared to the cracking effort.
(I'd love for someone to chime in and refer to a proven cryptosystem
without strong assertions such as P=NP)

ITT: Lodewijk trolls (fellow?) cryptonerds by mentioning P=NP. Sorry about
glossing over so much that it seems legit but is actually false in many
ways of looking at the situation.
The constant time argument is cheating; a large enough constant always
exceeds there result of a function ( when working in |R ). Although I
definitely agree that one needn't something NP hard to work as crypto.
Mixing functions like AES or hashes are quite different from asymetric
crypto, asymetric crypto has sterner demands on key shortness and
computational time. (Someone glossed over the fact that larger keys are
much much slower to compute, which (atm) really does become a problem
exponentially fast ;) )
The last part depends on how the break works. By crawling 2^k you've found
all possible inputs, not the one you actually meant. Especially when
stacking algorithms that makes a huge difference.
Now N correlates with both "security factor" and computational time
Well said. Adversaries are usually not theoretical. But we're usually
looking for multiple orders of excess safety, against attackers 1000-10,000
times faster (than current known best) over long periods of time. It's
still also cheating, of course, because polynomials can grow pretty fast
I think that the assumptions (esp 3) are too strong for grarpamp purposes.
I'll look at the CPA-secure definition later, but I suspect it is also too
strong. Then again, what secure meant was not really specified anyway.
NP just isn't the hardest class of problems out there.
I think I was confusing NP with NP-hard, but this is probably the strongest
counter argument out there! Haven't heard of crypto with decryption in
NP-hard but not in NP (would love to be pointed at it, if it's out there!).
Getting back to grarpamp:
formally proofed secure crypto besides the one time XOR?
There's proofs with the right assertions, which is all proofs usually are.
OTP still assumes a good source of randomness (which can be impossible).
Most others a hard problem (notable discrete log, prime factorization, such
things). Some (symmetric crypto) merely attempt to mix data such that it
doesn't turn homogenous (remains high in entropy/uses the output space
optimally) but also mixes thoroughly (all input (bits) is (are) represented
in all the output (bits)) without there being any determinable relationship
between in and output. We've gotten quite good at symetric, given that AES
looks a lot like DES but still nobody really found a problem with it
(biclique isn't that big a deal). AES is also ridiculously fast for how
good the encryption is. Asymmetric is still quite hard, given basically
everyone is worried basically everything out there. We all stick our heads
in the sand when someone mentions quantum computing.
What would proving AES even mean? Did anyone ever prove a cipher to be
secure? I guess you could construct a symetric cipher from asymetric
crypto, copypaste proof that asserts the security of the underlying problem
(and probably P!=NP) and call it a day.
Thanks for participating guys, you actually make me feel guilty not
studying this stuff harder and more formally correctly.

Yeah! The thing probably manages itself just fine. You'd rather have anyone

It's an example, ofc. But when you use a cipher you do so because you want
security. Not getting it seems like it's always a critical failure.
Is falling back to insecure better than failing fully (in some situations)?
Probably almost never. I think the nontrivial failures due to all

Technically it's absolutely pie to track stock on the Bitcoin blockchain.
If you can't roll it yourself, you can even use Prism and Colored Coins.
When issuing stock you'd instead issue Colored Coins. For security, make
people /also/ set up a "stock check" according to the following protocol:
1. The parties agree upon and commit to a transaction
2. The parties sign the "intention to transfer ownership"
3. The parties perform the Colored Coin transaction
4. The parties amend the "intention to transfer ownership" with the raw
(hexidecimal) transaction as it is included in the blockchain.
The advantage of this dual administration is that if something goes wrong
with the colored coin system, you still have a paper trail by which to
decide "true" ownership of the colored coins.
If you do not use the protocol but instead only perform step 3 - that's
still good enough. Bonus points if you create two documents, one for saying
"these coin will henceforth change ownership according to the bitcoin
system " and one for "these coins will henceforth change ownership using
the Dual Administration system", so you can state when you interrupt and
when you restart the paper administration. These documents are signed first
by the *coin owner, and then by the company/registration affiliate company
after a time period if the *coin owner is then still the coin owner. This
last step is important - over time a Bitcoin transaction grows in certainty.
To emit currency to shareholders, or perform votes:
1. Shareholder creates document requesting currency to be paid to
Bitcoin/Altcoin address (hell, make it an IBAN number for all I care)
2. Shareholder signs document with the same public/private key that
accesses the Colored Coins (or other proof of ownership)
3. Shareholder submits signed document to company/registration affiliate
Technically it's possible to emit continuously (daily, hourly,
per-profit-unit, whatever) by sending to the "last known address" of the
colored coin's owner. Privacy is preserved as a colored coin can be held by
pseudonyms, and so can the payment addresses.
So, technically and libertarian-free-society-with-contracts-wise it's all
cookies and dough.

It's not uncommon for a single person to be able to very justly parse

only with regards to "roadmap" and as a Deus Ex Machina decision-maker.
Another advantage is how a person can be the central repository for the
team's spirit and goals. And it is convenient for public communication, too.
To ensure adoption - get commitment to include in softwares early on. Get
commitment of engineers to continue working on it, unless the dictator
calls it quits or a time period expires (after which new commitment should
be arranged).
The original post specifically stated no democratic solution could be made.
A board could be better, but then one would have to find a board-full of
beneficial-dictator quality people. Also, a board's internal communication
is strained far more than a single person's communication. So long as a
single person has sufficient expertise, there is little pain in having only
a single person.
We can take Bitcoin as an example; Gavin Anderson has a lot of coins
himself (incentive to make it work) and he worked on the software for a
very long time (extensive expertise). He's not the best (or maybe even
good) at everything, but he's humble enough to admit that. If he had more
power it would probably be good for Bitcoin. He would probably make some
unpopular choices, and some of them will even be bad choices. But at least
the choices would be made, and progress would be much faster.
Linus is another example of this being helpful. Without him calling the
canonical versions things would be probably fracture a thousand incoherent
If there's any truth to Steve Jobs' biography, it seems he was quite the
beneficial dictator too.
So, that'd be my fix for this threat.

Use craigslist/newsgroups/e-mail and Tor with PGP and don't create a thick
protocol. I know you feel really cool for making a protocol, but the
Blockchain is a bad choice for this.
1. seller publicly publishes what one's offering, where, for how much and a
PGP public key.
2. buyer contacts the seller privately, sending the buyer's pubkey and his
order in encrypted format
3. seller agrees to sell and sends a bitcoin address(es) in encrypted
4. using Bitcoin escrow the buyer pays to the bitcoin address(es)
5. seller delivers and notifies buyer of his delivery
I'm not sure how to explain that Bitshops.net does pretty much that - but
conveniently. It cannot see whether it's contraband or not because the
offers are encrypted too (it's product agnostic/not involved with actual
delivery). It doesn't solve the advertising side of things and although all
security-vital code runs client side you still pretty much have to trust
Bitshops BV to not serve you an exploit - which it won't ever have to do
legally because of the situation in NL (afaik). That's also true for Tor
and everything else, of course, but let's just ignore that and pretend the
NSA cannot remote exploit every device out there anyway.

I think this is probably the worst part. We should have a mechanism for a
group of known cryptographers to n-out-of-k-vote-and-disable ciphersuites
immediately.  That way cipher agility might actually be valuable. Think of
it as a revocation mechanism.

But do they care about drugs? National security does not seem directly
impacted by drug use. In fact, there's plenty evidence that these markets
reduce drug-related violence (which is dangerous).
They probably launder intelligence to lesser agencies, just helping them
out. But they wouldn't want to waste their secrecy. I suspect that's also
the reason Tor is still believed to be safe, they don't show their hand for
nothing, and nothing has happened on Tor so far.
But, yeah, intelligence laundering, that's the largest problem.

Fill should probably be on the bottom of the application layer. This works
because that way all other layers are the same (including the mandatory
crypto). You need a filler-stream to (optionally) insert information into.
You do not want to trust the network (nor even Bob), so you need to be
somewhat intelligent about managing which open filled-connections you hold
- lest you leak information by opening connections. An
onion-routing-mesh-network seems like a way to deal with this, but
efficiency is an everlasting issue.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Bitcoin blocksize limit can be removed 
Why speak up now?
Without proof identity there is no saying as to authenticity. Without
authenticity wrt project goals, we're left with arguments in favor of
blocksize increase. It seems rather obvious blocksize should increase, to
ensure Bitcoin's continued cheap usability. The amount of which can be
debated, and no strong arguments seem to be provided for specific amounts.
I'm still in favor of a gradually increasing blocksize. It is reasonable to
introduce a "fee target" - the preferred fee-per-transaction, and to
increase the (increase in) blocksize should the fee target be exceeded to
ensure cheap transactions, and vise versa to prevent spam. But such
measures may be complicated compared to plain geometric increase.
IMHO, the blocksize should roughly follow the improvement in computing
hardware performance, so as to preserve the current degree of
accessibility. More is fine too, expected protocol improvements and use of
SPV (or similar) makes it feasible. Less is not fine, it increases price
per Bitcoin transaction which is a stronger-than-linear negative effect on
Bitcoin's fitness for transfer related purposes.

Are you trolling? Mining costs plenty, adding transactions to a block is
not actually rewarded except by the tx fee's. There is already a cost to
larger blocks; you have to send it out and get the network to commit to
your block: the larger the block, the longer the transmission time, the
larger the chance another block will beat yours! It seems marginal, but if
you have greater scale the cost increases too. (it's also the
principle reason for having such slow blocks)

Yeah.. It matters and it concerns miners quite greatly. I have chatted with
mining pool operators that were adding tx's for the sake of Bitcoin -
because it was losing them money. In fact, they were quite upset it was
losing them money.
Greater tx fee's would fix it ofc - but greater tx fee's are also bad for
Bitcoin. (Who wants an expensive money transfer service?)

You have a platform that's as fast as it's slowest component, a power
consumption of the sum of it's components. It's trustworthiness is the sum
of half the network - if over half the nodes say such is so it is accepted
Since these processors are all from either of the two foundries, well, draw
your own conclusions.
Note that there's little rationale for a blockchain here. You need
replicated work across devices. That means: being able to input a program
to every node without corruption (signed source) and being able to
checkpoint - hash the used memory. If all the hashes are equal you're good.
If they do not all line up - well it's probably your non-ecc xWatch/tablet
goofing up.
We are supposed to be doing this with academic papers. Reproduce the result
at another university that's as different as possible (different sponsors,
affiliations, religions, researchers, nations, etc), and the
trustworthiness increases. Thing is - the VW cars fooled the procedure.
Replication does not make a difference. The procedure was faulty.
Making a trustworthier platform by replicating work across many machines
seems doable. Using homomorphic encryption or some other means of
obfuscating the computation one could probably fool whatever attacks are
present in silicon.

I think the TLA's have had quantum computing capabilities for a while. Why
wouldn't they? I bet they could match the public's QC research budget.
Maybe they just didn't, whatever, or maybe they decided to go public
through a mysterious new research company. Or maybe the mysterious research
company is finally in the TLA's footsteps. Or maybe mysterycorp have a next
gen up and running for the TLA's. Or maybe the TLA's will spy and steal all
data from mysterycorp and do it bigger and better themselves. If we're
lucky it's all very whitehat and legitimate, and most of our crypto is
still pretty screwed <20 years. (Also, will have to learn more about QC's)
So many choices, so little to spy on!
On Bitshops.net I put NTRUencrypt (reference implementation through LLVM, I
assume people's machines are stupid but honest; bad RNG but not exploited,
figure the reference implementation would be the first to get hosed anyway)

I'll definitely couple it with a more traditional one (the resulting key
XOR'ing method seems rather flawless). The upside is that it seems secure
even against quantum computers. The downside is the investigation was
probably relatively shitty, and it might be very broken even to not quantum
computers (shoot me for trying).
Regarding keylength/degredation attacks in general:: it's not hard to make
browsers tell you it's in "degraded security" mode. Idk, a shittier lock
than a padlock. Like a bike's wheel lock. Or maybe a security camera (to
show they're watching).

@_subject: [Cryptography] [Crypto-practicum] Please critique this 
It is quite easy to guarantee a full record, provided the whole record. A
hash & sign is indeed sufficient. The proposed mechanism is too simplistic
- it wouldn't scale at all, and it doesn't exploit the features a
consortium could bring.
Bitcoin solves, for me, censorship and (to a certain degree) privacy wrt
transactions. It also has reliability, and a degree of immunity from the
law (another source of risk). One could say that although Bitcoin is
terribly volatile, it is inherently exceedingly robust.
You'll note Ripple is effectively a consortium of trusted parties doing a
blockchainish move. It's quite hidden how it works nowadays, but it's
probably just mutual ledger signing, perhaps in a contrived package to sell
it better. When last I checked, they obtained much of the
anti-censorship/privacy/reliability by piggybacking whatever transactions
on a bitcoin ledger.
You might like non-proof-of-work chains, like Nxt, which are not very
costly at all. The loss is the difficulty in determining one's actual
security. Mining gives you a nice easy number - hashes-deep-my-tx-is-buried
- that you can convert to actual cost for manipulating one's transaction.
Or Stellar, whose failure modes are less transparent entirely (network
splits aren't great conflict resolution afaik).
The core question here is, why do you want a Trusted Third Party
(consortium) so much? Why isn't a consortium-of-users enough to provide
whatever feature you're looking for?
If it's speed; you'll likely look at network latency primarily. If you're
doing a payment channel it's a RT between the recipient and you, or even
just the time it takes for you to sent (you know it's correct anyway,
provided the network is reliable enough). The action is entirely local so
that seems pretty great. A payment channel can also pass by a trusted
party, in case the RTT to the TTP is shorter.
Better yet is to trust your payment recipient - IOU's, both signed, perhaps
redeemable at a bank/cryptonet of choice, don't even require
ledger-lookups! If you can sue the opposite party afterwards (or otherwise
*permissionlessly* obtain your value), that's far superior.
