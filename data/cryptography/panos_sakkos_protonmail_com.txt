Hi Henry,
I believe this ( is a great way to explain the Diffie Hellman exchange to non-technical folks.
Hope that helps,

@_subject: [Cryptography] Estimating harddware cost of brute-forcing a key 
Hi all,
I want to compute a cost estimation of brute-forcing a key derivation function.
I assume that this key derivation is many iterations of SHA256s.
How is this estimation performed by the cryptography researchers?
How can I find the best Hash Rate per USD for a hardware that specializes in hash computations? Like for example the ASICs Bitcoin miners.
I assume that the attacker is paying just for the hardware, not electricity costs :)
Thank you in advance,
