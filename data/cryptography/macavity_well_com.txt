@_subject: Session Key Negotiation 
I am designing a transport-layer encryption protocol, and obviously wish
to use as much existing knowledge as possible, in particular TLS, which
AFAICT seems to be the state of the art.
In TLS/SSL, the client and the server negotiate a 'master secret' value
which is passed through a PRNG and used to create session keys.
My question is: why does this secret need to be negotiated?  Why can one
side or another (preference for client) not just pick a secret key and
use that?
I guess that one reason would be to give both sides some degree of
confidence over the security in the key.  Is this true, and if so is it
the only reason?
Many thanks, and apologies if this has been asked before...

I would if I could, believe me. :o)
The negotiated key will be used for both reliable (TCP-like) and non-reliable (UDP-like) connections, all tunnelled over a single UDP port for NAT-busting purposes.  For the TCP-like component, I want to follow TLS as much as possible for obvious reasons.
That's what I figured.  Thanks Eric.

@_subject: Why self describing data formats: 
The situation is improved slightly with XML schemas, as one can use frameworks like XMLBeans ( to get the protocol much closer to the code.  This can help a bit, but doesn't change the fundamentals.
You're still right in that if you have one group developing the code and another the protocol, you're probably screwed, but isn't this just as true (perhaps moreso) if you're rolling your own protocol structure instead of using XML?
