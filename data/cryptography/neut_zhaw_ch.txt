You may also want to look at IPFIX (RFC 7011), which is a self-describing format for network measurements. It is similar in spirit, but by necessity has to be a bit more general. Except for the provisions for IPFIX over UDP (which don’t really work), I think it does quite well.
(Disclaimer: I have worked closely with one of that RFC’s primary authors and have written a --- he says modestly --- really fast parser for it.)

I got both the dead tree edition and the audiobook; I've been listening to the audiobook on my commute and am about 2/3 the way through it. It's a fantastic book, a fantastic story, and everyone who's interested in the history of crypto should read or listen to it.

There is no such thing as plausible deniability. Or rather, there is no such thing in the real world. For example, if you hand over your USB stick and the authorities find a TrueCrypt volume on it which, however, seems to contain only innocuous data, do you really think that the customs official will hand it back to you with a smile and a wink?
I’m not sure who it was, but on this very list a member posted a conversation they had with a customs official who essentially said that they *knew* that the whole purpose of TrueCrypt was to have a hidden volume with the true stash.
In your example, the page you link to says, “Since there is no way to prove that there is any wallet beyond the ones that you have admitted to, the “attacker” will have to be satisfied with the revealed ones.” This is of course not true. If they are truly determined, they’ll start removing fingernails until you reveal the true passphrase to them. And then they will probably remove the remaining ones too, just to make sure that there aren’t any other “true” passphrases.
On the page it also says, “[Turning passphrase entry off] creates an illusion that passphrases were never used in the first place — one cannot accuse you of having hidden wallets.” Of course one can. And, again, if one is determined, one will.
It’s interesting that the page even shows the canonical XKCD, but without apparently realizing what it means. The whole point of the XKCD is that the attacker doesn’t have to prove or break anything: they can simply hit you over the head until you reveal what they want to hear.

Plausible deniability has been part of the TREZOR design since it's
beginnings:

While I agree with you, I wish you good luck with getting GCM banned. TLS 1.3 cipher suites are all stream ciphers. The list of TLS 1.3 cipher suites is (in full) [see  Section 8.4]: If it’s good enough for TLS, then surely it’s good enough for WiFi, right?

@_subject: [Cryptography] ANIMA protocol to "bootstrap a Secure Key 
Hi list,
I'm currently working on an R&D project in the area of IoT. One of the
problems is that the proverbial lightbulb does not know that it's being
screwed into a legitimate network and the network doesn't know that the
lightbulb is genuine. This project aims to solve
this problem using ANIMA
Do you know anything about this protocol? I've looked through it and it
seems to me that the protocol confuses "I believe that Bob is telling me
the truth" with "I can authenticate Bob", that this gives rise to all
kinds of security shenanigans, and that at any rate the security
assumptions or the attacker model are not clearly stated. Also, they call
what they do "bootstrapping a Secure Key Infrastructure", not "Public Key
Infrastructure", even though they don't define the term. Is “Secure Key
Infrastructure” a standard term that has somehow passed me by?
I am skeptical about ANIMA, but it seems to have a lot of industry
support, among others from the Thread group, which includes non-idiots
from Google/Alphabet, among others. Am I missing something here?

(I apologise if the quoting comes out wrong, but the email client I'm forced to use, Outlook/Mac, doesn't do proper quoting.)
    +1 to that. Perhaps not entirely coincidentally, the original "Why Johnny Can't Encrypt" article was from 1999: +2. Just this week I had the devil of a time finding out which of two keys (containing the same email address) Enigmail was using for encryption and it took me some shell-foo to find and eliminate the unwanted key. My grandma (if she were still alive) would probably not have managed that.
This problem also occurs with X.509-style PKI. People simply substitute "I'm not checking the WoT" for "I'm not checking the certificate". See, e.g.,  which also wins the prize for the article with the shortest abstract so far. Clearly, CAs also don't necessarily always validate the key, so it's not clear that substituting a CA for the user gets you anything.
IMO, WoT fails because the way it works is arcane; some of its assumptions are unwarranted; its default rules are arbitrary and not supported by evidence; and in order to understand whether you should trust a key according to WoT, you need fairly advanced knowledge of logic. Case in point: before we ditched the chapter on email encryption in our Security Basics course, we used to have a WoT exercise in our exams. If my grandma could have understood WoT, there would have been no point in doing that because all students would have received perfect scores on that exercise. (Assuming that students are cleverer than my grandma, who had almost no formal education.)
A slight tangent: I tend to avoid the word "trust" these days. It's too many things to too many people.
I'm sure they'll like the sound of that.
