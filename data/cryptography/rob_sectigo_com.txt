Here's a new number for you, FWIW.  Using the "a CA is a body that has control of at least one Certificate signing key" metric, I reckon there are about "170 CAs" at the moment.
The CCADB ( provides information on which body controls which keys.  I used crt.sh to cross-reference the CCADB information against the major browser trusted root stores (to exclude expired, not yet trusted, and no longer trusted CAs from this calculation).
(first revision was the list generated by crt.sh; second revision was manually curated to remove likely duplicates).

The change from what?
(You've reminded us of the flaws with the EFF's "650 CAs" soundbite, so I presume that's not the datapoint you're comparing "170 CAs" against).
CAs are not required (by Mozilla's policy, etc) to disclose technically constrained CA certificates to the CCADB, and so most are not disclosed.   (I just re-ran my analysis but filtered out "CA Owners" that only operated technically constrained CA certificates; however, the resulting list was unchanged).
BTW, ~10 of those ~170 don't operate intermediate CAs capable of issuing trusted server authentication certs.  (My analysis included them because they're capable of issuing trusted S/MIME and/or Code Signing certs).
