Well this just sucks if you ask me.
Scales linearly, right?  4,800 computers'll get it in a year?
How can one write a SETI-at-home-like screensaver that can attack the ciphertext without giving the underlying information to thousands of people?
Barring that sort of grass-roots effort, I'm personally mad enough to donate a PC + shipping.
