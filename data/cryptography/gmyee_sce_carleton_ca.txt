WORKSHOP OBJECTIVE
Cloud computing has emerged to address an explosive growth of web-connected devices, and handle massive amounts of data. It is defined and characterized by massive scalability and new Internet-driven economics. Yet, privacy, security, and trust for cloud computing applications are lacking in many instances and risks need to be better understood.    Privacy in cloud computing may appear straightforward, since one may conclude that as long as personal information is protected, it shouldn?t matter whether the processing is in a cloud or not. However, there may be hidden obstacles such as conflicting privacy laws between the location of processing and the location of data origin. Cloud computing can exacerbate the problem of reconciling these locations if needed, since the geographic location of processing can be extremely difficult to find out, due to cloud computing?s dynamic nature. Another issue is user-centric control, which can be a legal requirement and also something consumers want. However, in cloud computing, the consumers' data is processed in the cloud, on machines they don't own or control, and there is a threat of theft, misuse or unauthorized resale. Thus, it may even be necessary in some cases to provide adequate trust for consumers to switch to cloud services.    In the case of security, some cloud computing applications simply lack adequate security protection such as fine-grained access control and user authentication (e.g. Hadoop). Since enterprises are attracted to cloud computing due to potential savings in IT outlay and management, it is necessary to understand the business risks involved. If cloud computing is to be successful, it is essential that it is trusted by its users. Therefore, we also need studies on cloud-related trust topics, such as what are the components of such trust and how can trust be achieved, for security as well as for privacy.
This year, the CPSRT workshop will bring together a diverse group of academics and industry practitioners in an integrated state-of-the-art analysis of privacy, security, risk, and trust in the cloud. The workshop will address cloud issues specifically related to access control, trust, policy management, secure distributed storage and privacy-aware map-reduce frameworks. TOPICS OF INTEREST
The workshop includes but is not limited to the following topics that refer to computing in the cloud:
* Access control and key management
* Security and privacy policy management * Identity management
* Remote data integrity protection
* Secure computation outsourcing
* Secure data management within and across data centers
* Secure distributed data storage
* Secure resource allocation and indexing
* Intrusion detection/prevention
* Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and defense
* Web service security, privacy, and trust
* User requirements for privacy
* Legal requirements for privacy * Privacy enhancing technologies * Privacy aware map-reduce framework * Risk or threat identification and analysis
* Risk or threat management
* Trust enhancing technologies
* Trust management
These topics give rise to a number of interesting research questions to be discussed at the workshop, such as the following:
* How can consumers retain control over their data when it is stored and processed in the cloud? * How can users' trust in cloud computing be enhanced? How can reputation management be used in a practical way?
* How can transborder data flow regulations be enforced within the cloud? * How can solutions be tailored to a specific context? For example, how can privacy and security requirements be gathered and matched to service provisioning in an automated or semi-automated way, and on an ongoing basis?
* How can adequate assurance be given about the way in which cloud providers process and protect data?
* How can audit mechanisms be provided for the cloud?
Software demonstrations are welcome. We encourage submissions of ?greenhouse? work, which present early stages of cutting-edge research and development. The submission format must conform to the following: 10 pages maximum including figures, tables and references (see  Authors should submit the manuscript in PDF format. The official language of the meeting is English. Please submit your paper to the CPSRT 2010 Workshop submission server ( via an EasyChair account.
Peer-reviewed papers that are accepted for presentation at the workshop will be published in the CloudCom 2010 IEEE proceedings, and will be available in IEEExplore (EI indexing). The workshop organisers plan to invite the authors of selected high quality papers to revise and lengthen their papers for a special issue of a related journal or an edited book.
