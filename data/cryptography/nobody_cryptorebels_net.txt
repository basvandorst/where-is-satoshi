@_subject: Simple inner transposition steganography 
Come on, this is a terrible idea for steganography.  Unless this catches
on as some sort of fad, which (a) it won't and (b) even if it did it
would be short-lived, then sending a message with its letters scrambled
in this way would be the last thing you'd want to do for steganography.
The whole point of steganography is to make the cover message look normal.
Nothing would make your message more conspicuous than being filled with
random letter rearrangements.  In fact, this is such an obvious and
forced alteration that it hardly counts as steganography at all.
Maybe it works as a very, very weak form of encryption, one which can
be decrypted at a glance by humans but would evade the most simplistic
computer recognition systems.  But stego it ain't.
