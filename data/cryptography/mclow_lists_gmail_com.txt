Apple has 10s of people working on it, and most (I believe) of their output goes into the open source repo.
And this has been true for several years.

The ?best? part of the dynamic update systems that are currently in place (Windows, Mac, iOS, etc), is the opportunity for a malicious actor to automatically push malware/spyware to a million devices at the same time - or (possibly even more chilling) to deliver targeted payloads to individual systems.
[ Broadly speaking ]
When you run ?software update?, it sends a whole bunch of identifying information back to (say) Apple. How much of this is unique to your machine? Or you?
Then the servers at (say) Apple send back a list of recommended updates, along with URLs for downloading the updates.
This setup is *designed* to deliver individualized updates.

Yes, and it is in use in many development projects.
