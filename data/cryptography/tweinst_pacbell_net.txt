SSL/TLS is not a complete security solution. It is a building block. It is a protocol for communication between two end points. As such, its threat model deals with threats involving that communication. It does not deal with the security of the end point, because if you can compromise the machine that the software trying to communicate is running on, then no protocol can provide you with any level of security.
You might choose to argue that a communications protocol is not what we need, but that would have nothing to do with the threat model that SSL/TLS is designed around.
It seems what you're criticizing here is the Netscape and Microsoft client/server HTTPS-based security solutions for electronic commerce. These are certainly built using SSL/TLS as a building block, but criticisms of their design have very little relevance for SSL/TLS itself.
This really has nothing to do with TLS. If you don't like the installation process for Apache, you could fix it and send the patches back, or you could write your own web server.
The security UI for netscape/mozilla has always been terrible. IMHO, designing a user-friendly UI for crypto stuff that doesn't compromise security has been (and continues to be) the greatest obstacle to getting people to use this stuff.

This sort of statement bothers me.
In threat analysis, you have to base your assessment on capabilities, not intentions. If an attack is possible, then you must guard against it. It doesn't matter if you think potential attackers don't intend to attack you that way, because you really don't know if that's true or not and they can always change their minds without telling you.

The economic view might be a reasonable view for an end-user to take, but it's not a good one for a protocol designer. The protocol designer doesn't have an economic model for how end-users will end up using the protocol, and it's dangerous to assume one. This is especially true for a protocol like TLS that is intended to be used as a general solution for a wide range of applications.
In some ways, I think this is something that all standards face. For any particular application, the standard might be less cost effective than a custom solution. But it's much cheaper to design something once that works for everyone off the shelf than it would be to custom design a new one each and every time.

@_subject: "SSL stops credit card sniffing" is a correlation/causality myth 
No, not really. Until you can show me an Internet Draft for a solution to phishing that requires that we give up SSL, I don't see any reason to do so. As a consumer, I'd be very reluctant to give up SSL for credit card transactions because I use it all the time and it makes me feel safer.
If you don't know what we can do about phishing, why do you think that getting rid of SSL is a necessary first step? You seem to be putting the cart in front of the horse.

@_subject: DTLS for Java? 
Does anyone know of a DTLS implementation for Java? I'd rather avoid using OpenSSL through JNI if I possibly can.

@_subject: TLS break 
Perhaps because there have been so many false alarms over the years. Usually when I hear about an SSL MITM attack, it's really a browser UI spoofing attack with a bogus cert.
This is the first attack against TLS that I consider to be the real deal. To really fix it is going to require a change to all affected clients and servers. Fortunately, Eric Rescorla has a protocol extension that appears to do the job.
