@_subject: Dr. Chang's Key Exchange 
I am looking for analysis or implementations of Dr. C.N. Chang's
patent 5583939 "Secure, Swift Cryptographic Key Exchange" or the
newer  "Simplified Secure Swift..." and hoping listfolk
can point me in the right direction.
The only references I have found so far are towards a product called
"CET CipherKit" in a FAQ, (but not the kit itself) and in a MS outlook
plugin from ELQR.com.
I would be delighted by any relevant opinion or comment about the
key exchange process and how it could be attacked.  Statements like
"it is mathematically impossible to compute..." make my brow furrow
in a vain attempt to understand the issue.
