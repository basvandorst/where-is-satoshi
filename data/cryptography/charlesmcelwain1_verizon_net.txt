@_subject: Doubts about efficiency of Shor's factoring algorithm in quantum 
In case you missed this, since it appeared in the quantum physics section; but is relevant to quantum cryptography (or, cryptography on quantum computers.)
The argument here is that Shor's factoring algorithm is dependent on the Quantum Fourier Transform, which is sensitive to errors in quantum input states, and these errors are not capable of being suppressed by (current) quantum error correcting codes.
Most saliently, 1) these errors destroy the polynomial scaling of Shor's algorithm, and 2) for those not familiar with the QM terms, "decoherence" is roughly equivalent to "reduces to classical (i.e., non-quantum) state behavior".
Follow-ups on this line of research will be interesting for the evaluation of any impact of quantum computers on cryptography, and even generally, since the decoherence behavior would tend to make quantum computers approximate improving classical computers.

Apropos the recent discussion of Fake UIs and the problem of people most needing sensitivity to the dangers being most insensitive:
ISS laptops found to be infected with Gammima.AG virus; apparently not the first infection on the ISS.
What's worth noting about this story is that the laptops carried by astronauts into space *** DO NOT *** contain any anti-virus software.
