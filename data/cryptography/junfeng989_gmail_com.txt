Call For Papers
The 12th International Conference on Security, Privacy and Anonymity in
Computation, Communication and Storage (SpaCCS 2019)
July 14-July 17, 2019, Atlanta, USA
The 2019 International Conference on Security, Privacy and Anonymity in
Computation, Communication and Storage (SpaCCS 2019) is the 12th event in
the series of conferences which are devoted to security, privacy and
anonymity in computation, communication and storage. SpaCCS is now
recognized as the main regular event of the world that is covering many
dimensions including security algorithms and architectures, privacy-aware
policies, regulations and techniques, anonymous computation and
communication, encompassing fundamental theoretical approaches, practical
experimental projects, and commercial application systems for computation,
communication and storage. As applications of computer systems and networks
have permeated in every aspect of our daily life, the issues of security,
privacy, and anonymity have become increasingly critical. The conference
will provide a forum for the world-class researchers to gather and share
their research achievements, emerging ideas and trends in the highly
challenging research fields.
All accepted papers will be published by Springer LNCS (EI Indexed). Best
Paper Awards will be presented to high quality papers. Distinguished
papers, after further revisions, will be be published in 10+ SCI & EI
indexed prestigious journals (confirmed).
