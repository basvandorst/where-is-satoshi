@_subject: Source discrimination. 
Not exactly what you're looking for, but it might give you somewhere to
look...  In the early '70s there was work done at the University of
Utah by a doctoral candidate (first name 'Tony' - I forget the last
name) separating voice from music.  He used a recording by Caruso from
the early part of the 1900's as his data source.  Tony succeeded.  Had
the voice on one channel with the music on the other.  Used a digital
FFT to make the discrimination.  The FFT was compiled in Fortran and
ran under DEC Tenex in a standalone mode on a PDP-10.
(To give you the time frame) About this same time, also at the
University of Utah, Barry Wessler made a 'Hidden line' algorithm that
also ran on the same setup.  Barry made a 30 second animation of a
biplane doing a barrel roll to show that the hidden line algorithm

I don't have anything to say, but the discussion has been very
interesting - since I'm going to be one of the guinea pigs here in
Santa Clara...  I've learned a *bunch* of things to look out for - AND
to see if the county supervisors have even discussed any of these
I've enjoyed reading the discussion.

@_subject: Active Countermeasures Against Tempest Attacks 
Actually, quite a bit of the TEMPEST framework is not stopping an
adversary from reading what you have on your CRT (or display), but
denying the adversary the wherewithal for figuring out that you ARE
It would really be the pits to have someone standing off over the
horizion and saying...  "Hm-m-m...  70Mhz over THERE?  Why is a monitor
over THERE?  There shouldn't be ANYTHING over THERE...  Hm-m-m..  Who
do we know that uses..."  Well, you get the idea.
TEMPEST equipment is specially shielded so that it does not leak ANY RF
energy that can be picked up on RF direction finding equipment.
