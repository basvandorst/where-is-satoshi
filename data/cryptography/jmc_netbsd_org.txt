@_subject: The password-reset paradox 
I'd almost guarentee that's the reason. Buying OTP's comes out of  direct funds right there on the spot whereas "it costs us XXX to reset  passwords" is a nebulous stat that can likely be written however  someone wants to read it.
Plus given most OTP's have short expirations to generate rolling  revenue for the provider (ala SecuriID) it's not a simple cost to  start down this path for a lot of businesses.
