@_subject: If we had key escrow, Scarfo wouldn't be a problem 
Even if there were widespread key escrow, Scarfo sure as hell wouldn't
have used it. In fact, even if encryption were still tightly
export-controlled, he'd still have used that. The argument that we should
have more key escrow because of cases like this makes no sense.

@_subject: CFP: CodeCon  (deadline coming up!) 
The deadline for submissions is coming up in less than a month, so now's
the time to send them in.
CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS: CODECON 2002
CodeCon 2002, scheduled for February 15, 16, and 17 in San Francisco,
California, is the premier event in 2002 for the P2P, cypherpunk, and
network/security application developer community. It is a workshop for
developers of real-world applications  that support individual
During the first two days, our policy is "bring your own code"; while those not demonstrating software are welcome to attend, the focus is
primarily on developer discussion. The final day of the workshop is
intended to be more inclusive, consisting of public and press
demonstrations, interviews, panels and a public session allowing a larger number of presenters to demonstrate their projects in a more informal setting. All presentations must be accompanied by functional applications, ideally open source. Presenters must be one of the
active  developers of the code in question.
CodeCon strongly encourages presenters from non-commercial and academic
backgrounds to attend for the purposes of collaboration and the sharing
of knowledge by providing free registration to workshop presenters and
highly-discounted registration to full-time students. Public session presenters and approved members of the press will receive free
registration for the public session on Sunday.
IMPORTANT DATES
Submissions open:                               1 October 2001
Final submission deadline:                      1 January 2002
Final notification of acceptance:              15 January 2002
Conference begins:                            15 February 2002
Public session and public demonstrations:     17 February 2002
Post-conference web-based proceedings:           15 March 2002
SUGGESTED TOPICS
The focus of CodeCon is on running applications which:
*  use one or more of: cryptography, steganography, distributed    network architectures, peer to peer communications, anonymity    or pseudonymity
*  enhance individual power and liberty *  can be discussed freely, either by virtue of being open source or
having a published protocol, and preferably free of intellectual
property restrictions
*  are generally useful, either directly to a large number of users, or    as an example of technology applicable to a larger audience
Examples of excellent presentations include Mixmaster remailers and
extensions, OpenNap, Swarmcast, Mojo Nation, Magic Money, and OpenPGP
applications. Novelty in technical approaches, security assumptions,
and end-user functionality are excellent properties.
Presentations about basic technologies, such as a new cipher or hash,
non-interesting vulnerabilities in existing applications, or
discussions of unimplemented protocols are better suited for other
conferences. The guidelines for the CodeCon public session on Sunday
are less stringent than the main workshop; presentations which are more
tangential to CodeCon's focus may be accepted.
FORMAT OF PRESENTATIONS (main workshop)
Paper and Q&A
For those most comfortable with a traditional conference format, we
will accept papers up to 25 pages. We encourage HTML or plain ASCII
submissions, but can accept PostScript, PDF, or LaTeX. We will
distribute papers in advance of the conference, and will provide 30 or
60 minutes for discussion and Q&A, at the presenter's discretion. In
exceptional cases, we will accept anonymous papers and conduct either a
non-directed discussion or a Q&A session directed by proxy. All papers
should be accompanied by source code or an application. When possible,
we would prefer that the application be available for interactive use
during the workshop, either on a presenter-provided demonstration
machine or one of the conference kiosks. Additionally, during the paper
presentation, some use of this demo must be made; it may be relatively
brief, but a demonstration of the running application is essential.
Interactive demo
In addition to the traditional conference paper format, we encourage
highly interactive presentations. Throughout the event, we will have
several kiosks and local servers available for demonstration purposes.
We also strongly encourage presenters to bring their own hardware.
Application demos can be up to 20 minutes, followed by a period of up
to 40 minutes for Q&A, which can include demonstration of additional
features of the application not covered in the main presentation. If
desired by the presenter, we can distribute URLs of applications
several days before the workshop to allow attendees to familiarize
themselves with the basics of applications prior to the workshop
In areas where multiple projects fall roughly in the same domain, the
most efficient presentation may be a panel with one or more developers
from each team. These developers may then individually demonstrate
their applications, followed by discussion among the panel and Q&A with
the other attendees as to differences in design goals, implementation,
and other aspects of the systems. If we receive multiple submissions
from related projects for papers or demos, we may suggest to the
presenters that they combine into a panel. Additionally, presenters are
free to submit jointly as a pre-selected panel.
There is some flexibility in requirements and formats for presentations; please enquire if you would like to use an alternate form.
FORMAT OF PRESENTATIONS (public session)
On the afternoon of Sunday 17 February, we will set aside a substantial
amount of time for 5 minute-or-less project public session
presentations. Other events on this day, including panels and main
presentations, will be targeted at members of the press and public, so
brief presentations on Sunday will reach a wide audience. Presenters from the first two days who wish to make an additional public session presentation may do so.
SUBMISSION DETAILS
Presentations must be performed by one of the active developers on the
project. That's the rule -- no code, no mike. Multiple people may be involved in a presentation. You do get in free if you're part of a
presentation even if you don't speak during it, so  creativity (within
reason) is encouraged.
The workshop language is English, for both presentations and papers.
Ideally, demonstrations should be usable by attendees with 802.11b connected devices either via a web interface, or locally on Windows,
UNIX-like, or MacOS platforms. Cross-platform applications are most
Our venue may be 21+. If you are submitting and are under 21, please advise the program committee; we may consider alternate venues for one

Version 1.0.5 of BitTorrent is out, you can get it here -
All the encryption is now being done in C, as a result of which all that
old slowness has disappeared, resulting in a product which will happily
utilize your whole net connection.
Also in this release is a completely rewritten README.txt and
miscellaneous improvements/cleanups.
This version *should* work under Windows and MacOS X, but I don't have
machines which run those.
The next version will have platform-specific executable distributions
which don't require you have the python development libraries installed to
build them. I need volunteers for Windows and OSX build master!
Coming up - hex instead of base-32 encoding, and miscellaneous under the
hood improvements to prepare for the creation of torrent:// urls, a
prospect I'm all excited about.

I heard from an investor that they decided the first box was 'not secure
enough' and spent a bunch more time and money building the second mox,
which makes it harder to do physical snooping at either end, as a result
of which they haven't shipped a product and are now imploding.
Said investor was quite insistent that not shipping the first model was
necessary for security reasons. How not shipping enhances security I don't
I'd have bought the first box (phone -> device -> regular phone jack,
green light comes on if encrypted) if it had shipped for under
$50. Hopefully someone will start selling them some day.
I *wouldn't* have bought the second one, since it wouldn't work with
cordless phones, and frankly, I just don't care that much.

I'd be interested in helping however I can.
The ideal form factor would be a double-female phone connector with a
single green LED on it which lights up when it starts encrypting. It
should work when plugged in with *either* orientation. Remember, usability
is a very real issue.
You could use the Diffie-Hellman protocol I came up with -
Unlike RSA, Diffie-Hellman has no real gotchas to contend with, so someone
who understands symmetric key (like myself) can come up with a secure
protocol based on it fairly easily. It also has a trivial key generation
step. That RSA continues to be foremost on the public's mind despite
having always been clearly inferior is a testament to RSA corporation's
marketing success.
Using the protocol I gave above, a new key should be used for every
connection for forwards secrecy. However, it is forwards-compatible with
adding MitM prevention by both sides reporting the secure hash of the
shared symmetric key. This could be done either by the people reading it
in voice or by having persistent symmetric keys which sign it.
That said, trying to build that level of security for a first version is
outright stupid, and before anyone starts to claim otherwise, remember
this is a project which already failed once because of exactly that
It's only a matter of time before that becomes easy...

For those of you who don't know how this game is played, that doesn't mean
they've been handed $1.5m, it means that a bunch of people have said 'If
you get someone to be 'lead investor', I'll put in x' and if you add up
all the x's you get $1.5m. Most investors don't feel confident to due
diligence properly, and don't want to expend the cost if they do (and VC's
don't generally like taking on responsibility) so they go into these
conditional deals in which someone else has to take real responsibility
for claiming the company is a good investment.
There are almost never any actual signed commitments from people to follow
a 'lead investor', and you inevitably lose a bunch even if you get
one. And the chances of getting a lead investor in the current market are
pretty slim. Generally what happens in this situation is the company
starts getting 'bridge money' for a month or two at a time for a very
inflated amount of equity and highly favorable terms, diluting the company
and reducing the chances of further investment quite a bit in the process,
until eventually it goes belly-up, after which it sold for parts. In this
case that will probably be some patents which will be purchased by a
lawsuit machine who will sit on them until such time as someone else
actually makes a real product, and them sue them, hampering and possibly
destroying the product in the process.
Too bad the market doesn't care about perfect products. The market just
wants things which improve on what they currently have.

Several reasons -
a) It involves more phone calls, hence higher phone costs.
b) There's a risk that the call center will go belly-up, rendering all the
hardware worthless. Most companies quite reasonably don't want to take on
that risk.
c) It has much higher development costs than passive-attack-only
Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and as a result much higher development risk,
making it a much less worthy investment. Even without MitM prevention,
phone encryption raises the snooping bar so far above what we currently
have that there's no point in worrying about anything more until it's in

The first batch should be sold as a Sharper Image exlusive -

unload initial inventory at a profit.
I can't emphasize enough that it's very important that the form factor be
a double-female phone jack and work when plugged in with *either*

I don't see how one could possibly impinge on their IP when using COTS,
unless they have an outright patent on using a device to encrypt a phone
line, which is possible (I'm pretending I'm naive enough to not say
'probable'). In that case, the patent is clearly invalid, but also
impossible to sidestep.

@_subject: crypto flaw in secure mail standards 
Currently, if you are compromised at some point then an attacker can go
back to the mail archives and read every message you've ever sent or
received. With separate encryption keys, it would be possible to achieve
forward secrecy, so that the old messages would be unreadable to everyone,
including you.
Forward secrecy is arguably a more important property of mail to have than
authentication, and is much easier to build properly, since it doesn't get
into the issues of identity. Unfortunately, none of the current mail
standards support it at all.
In fact, forward secrecy is all that Disappearing Inc. did - does anybody
know how they're doing?

@_subject: crypto flaw in secure mail standards 
The problem here is that all the encrypted mail standards don't actually
send encrypted mail, they send encrypted files in mail. A *mail* message
consists of headers and a body. The right way to send encrypted mail is to
create a mail message, encrypt it headers and all, and include that in a
mail message of type multipart/alternative, with the alternative being a
text message saying 'this mail is encrypted'.
The sticky point is the Message-id header, which is generally tacked on by
the server. There are a couple ways it could be dealt with.
I recently did some digging into encrypted mail standards and was appalled
that they don't work that way. Reinventing how mail works is not something
one should do while giving it encryption. I raised a big stink about it on
coderpunks and said I'd make my own standard for encrypted mail before I'd
implement any of the existing ones, which I got a bunch of criticism
for. I didn't realize at the time that the existing ones are insecure in
addition to being stupid.

@_subject: secure hash modes for rijndael 
sha-256 is ridiculously slow, so I've done some thinking about hash modes
for rijndael.
To begin with, there's the issue of padding - this can be done by
appending a 1 and then padding with zeros to the next multiple of a block
size. If the data to be hashed is already a multiple of a block size and
doesn't end in a 1 to begin with, no padding is necessary. This gets rid
of a lot of unnecessary work for hashing small files.
Making a hash requires two fixed keys, the logical values for them are all
0 and all 1 bits.
First, compute CBC MACs using the two fixed keys (a CBC MAC is where
encrypt the first block, xor with the second, encrypt again, xor with the
third, etc.) Call the two MACs A and B. Now encrypt A using B and B with
it's last byte xored with FF using A (the xor is in case the data is only
a single block length, making A and B both be the original
file). Concatenate those two values together and that's the hash.
I believe this algorithm is quite secure. It produces an output twice the
length of the block size, which should be as resistant to birthday attacks
as the block cipher is to regular attacks. It has a hash rate of 1/2,
which makes sense since it's output is twice as large. Even at that rate,
it's still much faster than sha.
It would be nice if there was an algorithm which used rijndael with 256
bit blocks to produce a hash of 256 bits and had a hash rate of 1, but I
haven't been able to come up with one.
One neat trick - if you have a short file (about 20 bytes) and want a 160
bit hash of it, you can encrypt the file using itself as the key.
I think releasing a sha256 standard at all was a bad idea - sha1 will last
a while yet, and a standard hashing mode for rijndael will work much
better. This is a very serious issue with regards to blob identification,
since you can't just switch your metadata to refer to the same files but
using a different hash function. I strongly urge everyone who indexes
blobs to continue using sha1 until a decent hashing algorithm has been
picked as the next standard.

There doesn't appear to have been much study of how to construct secure

seem to prefer the traditional sending of a dead tree letter either in
advance or containing information only they'd know, containing a nonce to
be included in all future correspondence to prevent connection hijacking.
encrypted partitions - this is the one journalists understand and
occasionally someone gets busted using. As often as not, the busters are
some petty third-world dictatiorship and the bustee is someone keeping
records, so this category is not without it's warm fuzzies. It seems this
is the place one should start if you're looking to use crypto anywhere.
breaking into machines to get anonymity from them - this was standard
practice back in the BBS days, but now there's so much traffic to analyze
and so many hack attempts most script kiddies don't even bother.
ZKS - it's not clear that this was used for much of anything in it's short
lifespan, and it's gone now
hotmail/yahoo/hushmail/etc. accounts - these are used for a very limited
degree of anonymity, but are quite happy to obey search warrants. Nothing
threatening here.
So there you have it. The state of deployed crypto is quite limited, and
in practice hardly used for anything sinister at all.

The only cases I've ever read of crypto being used by illegal cells has
been encrypting of hard drives - certainly a use of crypto, but not one
which might have helped the world trade center terrorists avoid getting
caught - encrypting hard drives is for damage mitigation, and we don't
have any evidence so far that intelligence was onto them in the least.
People in cells probably forego electronic communications completely for
highly sensitive information - face to face communication works fine and
doesn't involve anywhere near the risks.

Such attacks can be stopped by reseeding once a minute or so, at much less
computational cost than doing it 'continuously'. I think periodic
reseedings are worth doing, even though I've never actually heard of an
attack on the internal state of a PRNG which was launched *after* it had
been seeded properly once already.

That certainly is a concern, although no more of a concern it is with the
even faultier hacked-up entropy collection techniques currently
used. Getting any entropy at all on a headless machine is a real problem.
That's very lame. It gets even more worrisome when you have computers
which are supercooled so you can overclock them...
Bias correction in hardware is pointless. It's run through an entropy
gathering device later on anyway, so as long as you have a *known* amount
of entropy per bit it's okay if it's not 1.
It should default to trusting the hardware RNG, and have the option of not
doing so be there for those who think they need it.
That's perfectly reasonable.

CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS: CODECON 2002
Please forward wherever applicable.
CodeCon 2002, scheduled for February 15, 16, and 17 in San Francisco,
California, is the premier event in 2002 for the P2P, cypherpunk, and
network/security application developer community. It is a workshop for
developers of real-world applications that support individual liberties.
During the first two days, our policy is "bring your own code"; while
those not demonstrating software are welcome to attend, the focus is
primarily on developer discussion. The final day of the workshop is
intended to be more inclusive, consisting of public and press
demonstrations, interviews, panels and a public session allowing a larger
number of presenters to demonstrate their projects in a more informal
setting. All presentations must be accompanied by functional applications,
ideally open source. Presenters must be one of the active developers of
the code in question.
CodeCon strongly encourages presenters from non-commercial and academic
backgrounds to attend for the purposes of collaboration and the sharing of
knowledge by providing free registration to workshop presenters and
highly-discounted registration to full-time students. Public session
presenters and approved members of the press will receive free
registration for the public session on Sunday.
IMPORTANT DATES
Submissions open:                               1 October 2001
Final submission deadline:                      1 January 2002
Final notification of acceptance:              15 January 2002
Conference begins:                            15 February 2002
Public session and public demonstrations:     17 February 2002
Post-conference web-based proceedings:           15 March 2002
SUGGESTED TOPICS
The focus of CodeCon is on running applications which:
*  use one or more of: cryptography, steganography, distributed    network architectures, peer to peer communications, anonymity    or pseudonymity
*  enhance individual power and liberty *  can be discussed freely, either by virtue of being open source or
   having a published protocol, and preferably free of intellectual
   property restrictions
*  are generally useful, either directly to a large number of users, or    as an example of technology applicable to a larger audience
Examples of excellent presentations include Mixmaster remailers and
extensions, OpenNap, Swarmcast, Mojo Nation, Magic Money, and OpenPGP
applications. Novelty in technical approaches, security assumptions, and
end-user functionality are excellent properties.
Presentations about basic technologies, such as a new cipher or hash,
non-interesting vulnerabilities in existing applications, or discussions
of unimplemented protocols are better suited for other conferences. The
guidelines for the CodeCon public session on Sunday are less stringent
than the main workshop; presentations which are more tangential to
CodeCon's focus may be accepted.
FORMAT OF PRESENTATIONS (main workshop)
Paper and Q&A
For those most comfortable with a traditional conference format, we will
accept papers up to 25 pages. We encourage HTML or plain ASCII
submissions, but can accept PostScript, PDF, or LaTeX. We will distribute
papers in advance of the conference, and will provide 30 or 60 minutes for
discussion and Q&A, at the presenter's discretion. In exceptional cases,
we will accept anonymous papers and conduct either a non-directed
discussion or a Q&A session directed by proxy. All papers should be
accompanied by source code or an application. When possible, we would
prefer that the application be available for interactive use during the
workshop, either on a presenter-provided demonstration machine or one of
the conference kiosks. Additionally, during the paper presentation, some
use of this demo must be made; it may be relatively brief, but a
demonstration of the running application is essential.
Interactive demo
In addition to the traditional conference paper format, we encourage
highly interactive presentations. Throughout the event, we will have
several kiosks and local servers available for demonstration purposes. We
also strongly encourage presenters to bring their own hardware.
Application demos can be up to 20 minutes, followed by a period of up to
40 minutes for Q&A, which can include demonstration of additional features
of the application not covered in the main presentation. If desired by the
presenter, we can distribute URLs of applications several days before the
workshop to allow attendees to familiarize themselves with the basics of
applications prior to the workshop sessions.
In areas where multiple projects fall roughly in the same domain, the most
efficient presentation may be a panel with one or more developers from
each team. These developers may then individually demonstrate their
applications, followed by discussion among the panel and Q&A with the
other attendees as to differences in design goals, implementation, and
other aspects of the systems. If we receive multiple submissions from
related projects for papers or demos, we may suggest to the presenters
that they combine into a panel. Additionally, presenters are free to
submit jointly as a pre-selected panel.
There is some flexibility in requirements and formats for presentations;  please enquire if you would like to use an alternate form.
FORMAT OF PRESENTATIONS (public session)
On the afternoon of Sunday 17 February, we will set aside a substantial
amount of time for 5 minute-or-less project public session presentations.
Other events on this day, including panels and main presentations, will be
targeted at members of the press and public, so brief presentations on
Sunday will reach a wide audience. Presenters from the first two days who
wish to make an additional public session presentation may do so.
SUBMISSION DETAILS
Presentations must be performed by one of the active developers on the
project. That's the rule -- no code, no mike. Multiple people may be
involved in a presentation. You do get in free if you're part of a
presentation even if you don't speak during it, so creativity (within
reason) is encouraged.
The workshop language is English, for both presentations and papers.
Ideally, demonstrations should be usable by attendees with 802.11b
connected devices either via a web interface, or locally on Windows,
UNIX-like, or MacOS platforms. Cross-platform applications are most
Our venue may be 21+. If you are submitting and are under 21, please
advise the program committee; we may consider alternate venues for one or
more days of the event. If you have a specific day on which you would
prefer to present, please advise us.

Recognizing that many of the developers of the most interesting cypherpunk
applications are unable to afford accommodations and other expenses in San
Francisco, CodeCon will attempt to locate housing and otherwise assist
with issues for presenters on a case-by-case basis. Please contact
codecon-admin at codecon.org if your submission is accepted but you require
assistance to attend.
If your organization is interested in sponsoring CodeCon, we would love to
hear from you. In particular, we are looking for sponsors for social meals
and parties on any of the three days of the conference, as well as
sponsors of the conference as a whole, prizes or awards for quality
presentations, and assistance with transportation or accommodation for
presenters with limited resources. If you might be interested in
sponsoring any of these aspects, please contact the conference organizers
at codecon-admin at codecon.org.
If you have questions about CodeCon, or would like to contact the
organizers, please mail codecon-admin at codecon.org. Please note this
address is only for questions and administrative requests, and not for
workshop presentation submissions.

They claim an attack on 256-bit Rijndael and 192 and 256 bit Serpent. This
is a bit ironic, since Serpent's big claim previously was that it
exchanged some performance loss for better security, which turns out not
to be the case.

Before claiming that the TCPA, which is from a deployment standpoint
vaporware, could help with gnutella's scaling problems, you should
probably learn something about what gnutella's problems are first. The
truth is that gnutella's problems are mostly that it's a screamer
protocol, and limiting which clients could connect would do nothing to fix
Limiting which clients could connect to the gnutella network would,
however, do a decent job of forcing to pay people for one of the
commercial clients. In this way it's very typical of how TCPA works - a
non-solution to a problem, but one which could potentially make money, and
has the support of gullible dupes who know nothing about the technical
issues involved.
Your personal vendetta against Lucky is very childish.

You can try running a sniffer on it yourself. Gnutella traffic is almost
all search queries. Mojo Nation actually had a completely excessive amount of bandwidth
donated to it. There was a problem that people complained of losing mojo
when running a server due to the total amount of upload being greater than
the total amount of download. The main user experience disaster in Mojo
Nation was that the retrieval rate for files was very bad, mostly due to
the high peer churn rate.
Oh gee, that paper mostly talks about high churn rate too.
In fact, I was one of the main developers of Mojo Nation, and based on
lessons learned from that figured out how to build a system which can cope
with very high churn rates and has good leech resistance. It is now mature
and has had several quite successful deployments.
Not only are the algorithms used good for leech resistance, they are also
very good at being robust under normal variances in net conditions - in
fact, the decentralized greedy approach to resource allocation outperforms
any known centralized method.
The TCPA, even if it some day works perfectly (which I seriously doubt it
will) would just plain not help with any of the immediate problems in
Gnutella, BitTorrent, or Mojo Nation. I would guess the same is true for
most, if not all other p2p systems.

Indeed, the only PK primitive I *really* trust is secure hash based
signatures -
Going one step below that, most of the practical breaks we've had have
been from protocol screwups rather than key length problems, and I've
never seen a list purporting to be definitive of all the gotchas in RSA,
so the only fancy math primitive I feel confident to design a protocol
with is diffie-hellman.

Yes and no, they're for real in that they have some algorithms which do
function as public key cryptography, and there's been some work done
trying to break them which hasn't come up with anything, but no in the
sense that people are worried that there will be some cataclysmic break of
the cryptography which causes the whole system to be completely insecure.
That's the main problem, PKI is only called for in specific applications,
and in those the good old reliables - diffie-hellman for encryption and
DSA for signing - are still all that's called for.
(Yeah, yeah, diffie-hellman isn't an 'encryption' algorithm, it's a key
agreement protocol, but it can be combined with symmetric key stuff to
have the effect of public key encryption.)

@_subject: Analysis of Neural Cryptography 
In short, neural cryptography is broken (hardly a surprise). I think, however, that it's possible to get the same level of security as
merkle puzzles using a similar scheme - Alice and Bob agree that their
sharked secret will be based on a number less than, say 10^18, they both
compute 5*10^9 hashes of numbers selected at random in that range, and
send them to each other. The shared secret is the smallest hash which they
happen to both have selected at random.
This algorithm can be made significantly more efficient and secure by
using bloom filters instead of lists of hashes.
This is an okay (although currently impractical) shared secret exchange
algorithm. It can be used for public key encryption, but not signing. It's
main problems are that once in a while it fails (if there's no shared
secret) and that it's security level is a mere n vs. n^2, and the n is a
measure of bandwidth used at that, so it's currently impractical.
Notably, computers are getting fast enough that merkle-style cryptography
looks to become practical for some applications in the forseeable future.

I don't think that's really 'steganography' per se, since no attempt is
made to hide the fact that the information is in there. The quasi-stego
used is just to prevent bad audio artifacts from happening.

There's no way a laser's going to be cheaper than a Johnson noise
Really, the random number generation has been solved - use a Johnson noise
generator for the random bits, and (not withstanding /dev/random's
suboptimal behavior) put them through a cryptographic device which will
spew out indefinite amounts of random numbers once it's gotten
sufficiently seeded.

Matt, is there some reason why you didn't bother asking a single locksmith
if they knew about this attack already before claiming it was 'new' in
your paper? Have you looked into the differences in actual costs of
production of the various ways of making locks more secure? Do you have
any information on how common various ways of breaking into locks are done
in practice?
I'm not arguing that security through obscurity is a good thing, just
pointing out that your claims of the importance of your publication are
being made mostly in ignorance.
