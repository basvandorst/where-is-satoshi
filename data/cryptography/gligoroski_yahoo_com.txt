@_subject: Solving systems of multivariate polynomials modulo 2^32 
In order to solve a system of 3 polynomials of order 3
with 3 variables x1, x2 and x3 in the set Z_{2^32} and
coeficients also in Z_{2^32} I used the Mathematica
5.1 function Reduce[...,{x1,x2,x3},Modulus->2^32]. It
is giving the solutions but it is not very fast. I
wanted to programe a procedure in C in order to get
more speed in the computation.
I was trying to figure out what algorithms are used in
the "Reduce" function of Mathematica (reading Wolfram
web pages) but I couldn't find any specific
information for the algorithms they are using for
solving multivariate polynomials modulo 2^32.
I found several papers that are dealing with solving
univariate or multivariate polynomials in finite
fields such as:
1. Lauder :
2. van de Woestijne :
and 3.  Barreto and Voloch:
4. Ding, Gower and Schmidt:
but the algorithms there are for soving polynomials
over finite fields GF(p) or GF(p^n) which is different
than just solving polynomials (univariate or
multivariate) modulo 2^32.
I will appreciate any hint or coment.

Thanks David, In the example you gave, the coefficients are from
Z_{2}. If they are from Z_{2^32} the situation is
similar but not the same (a little bit more
complicated). Does anybody examined how does the
complexity of the Hensel lifting goes whit the increasment of the degree and dencity of the
mutivariate polynomials Z_{2^n}[x1,x2,x3]?
For example if we have 3 multivariate polynomials
P1[x1,x2,x3], P2[x1,x2,x3] and P3[x1,x2,x3]
with 3 variables x1, x2 and x3 but the degrees of the
polynomials are high (say 32) and the number of terms
they have is also big (for example 833, 2825 and 4708)
and all their coeficients are from Z_{2^32}, what
would be the workfactor to find the solutions?
For example Mathematica's function
Reduce[...,{x1,x2,x3},Modulus->2^32] can not solve the
problem (as opposite of the situation when the degree
of P1, P2 and P3 is small. )  I suppose that if we work with m variables, high
degree of the polynomials in Z_{2^n}[x_1,x_2,...x_m]
and those polynomials are dense - then he number of
candidates from lift to lift in the Hensel lifting is
encreasing exponentially at least for the first n/2
lifts. However, I couldn't find any mathematical prove in the
literature for this. I found many interesting papers that deals with Hensel
lifting and applications in cryptography, and among
others I found these:
1. The Hardness of Hensel Lifting: The Case of RSA and
Discrete Logarithm (2002)
2. An Approach to Hensel's Lemma (2001)
3. Cryptanalysis of an Algebraic Privacy Homomorphism

can Ariel you are right.
David Wagner had also a similar opinion (he sent me a
private message for this matter). Actually I had made
a small experiment to test his (and your claims), and
for the values of the solutions over Z_{2^i}, i=1,20
from lift to lift after i=3 the number of possible
solutions stays constant to 16 (not 8??!?!).
Anyway, this suggest one obvious thing: if a PK system
is built over Z_{2^x}[x_1,x_2,...,x_m] then the number
of variables m have to be at least 80 (or 128, or 196,
...) in order to eliminate the Hansel lifting as a
form of attack. But that is another story ...
Thank you.

@_subject: History, context, QKD and the Internet 
Hmmm, this is very interesting "bootstrapping" and false matching.
1. You are mentioning "1st generation QKD". Do we have now 2nd generation of QKD? Where the
"1st generation QKD" was applied and used? Nowhere! What are "the upgrades" and the new things
that "2nd generation QKD" has?
"Our 1st generation of Snake Oil was excellent, but unfortunately was sharply attacked by the people from
the field of Cryptology, and consequently it was not broadly accepted. But wait a minute, we have come now
with our 2nd generation of Snake Oil. It is even better than the first one, and it is cheaper. Previously if you
had to pay $100,000 per year for the secure link, now you have to pay 10 times less i.e. only $10,000. That is
$90,000 saving per year, and imagine for what scientific purposes you can spend those $90,000. ..."
2. All optical networks are reality and nowadays are built even for home-end users. What that fact has to do with
"x-th generation of QKD"? In your post you are using the success in one field in Physics to
advocate possible acceptance of another (Quantum Cryptography). While, the optical physics has and will
have one of the crucial roles in modern and future Internet (taking care about the physical layer of the
network), QC is trying to offer better solutions (or replace some parts) of a well developed, well established,
and well applied scientific field (The field of Cryptology). My opinion is that it won't happen. Dead end.

@_subject: Toshiba shows 2Mbps hardware RNG 
I think that the market is a little bit bigger than just applications running Monte Carlo simulations.
For example, Gambling industry - which is also multi-billion industry Since this news have been discussed in this cryptographic mailing list, I would be interested when
some of the cryptographers test this device too. The device produces stream of random bits with a
speed of 2Mbps, but in the article there is nothing about the cryptographic strength of the produced
stream. It can produce statistically qualitative uniform random bits, but still to be cryptographically

Probably you have heard about this:
CCC publishes fingerprints of German Home Secretary
Source: Heise.de
In a protest against the use of biometric data, the
Chaos Computer Club (CCC) has taken a step that will
raise a few eyebrows ? in the current issue of its
club magazine Die Datenschleuder, the hackers have
published the fingerprint of German Home Secretary,
Link: QUESTION: Does anybody knows about the existence of a
security research in area of grading the easiness to
steel biometric data.
For example, I guess that stealing information of
someone's "face" is easier than stealing information
about someone's "fingerprints",
but stealing information about someone's "retina"
would be much harder.
Such a scale can be useful in the design of secure
protocols and secured information systems.
