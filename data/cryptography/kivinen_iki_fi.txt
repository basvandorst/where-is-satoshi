contains ecpp certificates for IKE primes (768, 1024, 1536, 2048,
3072, 4096, 6144, 8192 bit Diffie-Hellman groups), i.e proven
Sophie-Germain primes.
The ikeprime-xxxx.txt is the prime itself and the
ikeprime-xxx{,-primo}-certificate.txt is the certificate for it. I
used two different programs to prove those primes primo and ecpp. The
primo was faster, thus bigger groups are only proven by that.
There is also certificates for (p - 1) / 2, but those are mostly
redundant as most certificates starts with N-1 test, which will
actually proves the (p - 1) / 2 also.

I considered adding the ecpp certificates to
draft-ietf-ipsec-ike-modp-groups document, but as the certificates are
several magabytes in total, there is no point of adding them to this
kind of document (the document would be several hundred pages long
consisting only numbers...). The draft-ietf-ipsec-ike-modp-groups used to have pointer to the ftp
site having the certificates
(ftp://ftp.ssh.fi/pub/ietf/ecpp-certificates), but that was removed
during the IESG review, because url references are not stable enough
in general (the ftp://ftp.ssh.fi/pub/ietf/ecpp-certificates site is
supposed to be there forever).
That site also includes certificates of modp groups from the RFC 2412
(and (p-1)/2 also).
I actually just finished finding the 16384 bit Diffie-Helman group
with same kind of parameters. It took about 9.5 months to generate.
The 12288 bit group took only about 15 days to generate.
Proving them will propably take even longer than generating them...

We have our own software and crypto library to generate those primes.
To create ~500 bit group it takes about 10 seconds. To create ~1000
bit group it takes about minute. Here are ike style primes between
512-1024 where the bits is incremented by 32 every time. These are not
proven, but running primo or similar on them shouldn't take that long,
so you can do it yourself if you need a proven prime:

Those primes are generated using the rules defined in the RFC 2412.
High order bits makes classical remainder algorithms faster, and low
order bits helps the Mongomery-style algoritms.
