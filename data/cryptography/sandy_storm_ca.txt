Also note that RFC 2104 on the HMAC construction used in IPSEC
explicitly cites Dobbertin and says the attack does not apply:
   ... MD5 has been recently
   shown to be vulnerable to collision search attacks [Dobb].  This
   attack and other currently known weaknesses of MD5 do not compromise
   the use of MD5 within HMAC as specified in this document

@_subject: [Users] The role of compression in cryptosystems 
I agree.
Yes, though there is a caveat. If the compression adds a header, that may
give the cryptanalyst known plaintext to work with, even in situations where
he wouldn't have known plaintext of actual messages, or it may save him the
trouble and risk of some other attack required to get plaintext.
The tradeoff is that, against any risks the header introduces, you get several
advantages. The message is shorter so the analyst gets less ciphertext to
attack, compressed text has higher entropy per block which makes the cipher
stronger in information theory terms (longer unicity distance) and (related
but not quite the same) there are no obvious characteristics, such as being
ASCII text with top bit of each byte 0, to help an attacker recognise valid
plaintext after trial decryption.
Compressed text with a predictable header would not be secure against that
machine. It needs only one or two blocks of known plaintext.

Once you've pointed it out, it seems obvious, but at least to me it wasn't
until you did. Methinks that indicates a good piece of work on your part.
Does using non-adaptive compression save the day?
You can compress English/ASCII text better than 10% by just looking at
pairs of characters and, whenever the 2nd one is ' ', throw it away and set the top bit of the first one. Or pick 256 common strings - 'ing', 'the', etc - and encode them as bytes
128-255 while using 0-127 for ASCII. This should give fair compression.
Or use 16-bit words where those with top bit 1 encode 2^15 common English
words and anything not on the list just falls back to ASCII storage using
16-bit words with top bit 0. I designed a system like that once. For
English text it gave compression comparable to the common algorithms.
Send off-list mail if you want the details.
Of course the problem with non-adaptive compression is that you have to
know when you design it what the inputs will look like when you run it.
The above schemes would fail miserably on anything but English text.

Are Nystrom's "perfect" s-boxes a useful primitive here? With 2n bits in
and n out, you can construct an s-box such that all output columns are
bent boolean functions, and so are all linear combinations of columns.
It seems to me that some sort of S-P network built with Nystrom s-boxes
ought to give us what we need here. We need to compress a bunch of
low-entropy data into a high-entropy chunk, and each s-box gives 2-to-1
compression. We need provable properties for the network, and Nyberg's
proofs or the s-box properties give us a starting point.

@_subject: FreeSWAN & US export controls 
Beyond doubt it is important to keep FreeS/WAN free, specifically to
continue development in ways that keep it clear of US regulations. I
think that means not taking US contributions to the code. Various Americans have made important contributions by testing, reporting
bugs, joining design discussions and so on, just not code.
To me, the interesting question is what can we do to get FreeS/WAN
more widely distributed, without giving up that freedom.
FreeS/WAN is already included in several Linux distributions not produced
in the US. SuSE, Mandrake, Conectiva, ...
For a list, see:
However, RedHat does not include it. The issue doesn't seem to be just that
they don't ship crypto. Checking the RPMs on RedHat 7.2, I find GnuPG, OpenSSH, OpenSSL, CIPE, ... but not FreeS/WAN.
So should we just suggest that everyone buy distributions that do include
Or is there something we should be doing to get RedHat, and Debian, and
other US-based distributions to include it?

@_subject: It's Time to Abandon Insecure Languages 
I don't have an exact reference, but there's an excellent
paper on this by Hoare:
He argues that pointers are to data structures as gotos are to
control structures. Programmers should, for both safety and
productivity reasons, generally work with higher-level
abstractions. Arrays, lists, etc. for data; various types
of loop, function calls and recursion for control flow. Of
course those reduce to jumps, labels, and pointers at the
assembler level, but let the compiler do the reductions.
For Hoare's comments on Ada, see the ACM Turing Award
lecture he gave shortly after resigning from the Ada
design committee:

@_subject: building a true RNG 
I think the interesting question is whether, for M-bit hash inputs,
and an N-bit hash, with a lower bound Q on entropy per input batch,
so M > Q > N, we can show, as I think Denker is claiming to have done,
that the entropy of hash(M) must be > N - epsilon, for some epsilon
small enough to ignore.
That would imply not only that all 2^N values occur, but that they
are reasonably evenly distributed.

No. It can also use RSA public keys without embedding them in
certificates or requiring a CA, let alone a 3rd party one.
Sounds right to me, though "unauthenticeted" might be
more precise.
That is certainly not what FreeS/WAN meant by "opportunistic encryption".
OE does authenticate all connections. The trick is that the public keys
are stored in DNS so you do not have to exchange keys with the admin of
a site before you can do secure communications to it.
For this to be secure, you need DNSsec widely deployed. In effect you
are using DNS as a PKI. Without DNSsec, this reduces to something
fairly anonymous -- anyone who can lie in DNS can pretend to be
anyone they choose. However, that was never the design intent of
OE. If you want anonymous connections, there are easier ways.
