@_subject: [Cryptography] Random numbers only once 
Which is exactly what we do in Solaris (and what Illumos etc do as well).  Any writes to /dev/random or /dev/urandom or their equivalents that come over /dev/crypto with the appropriate ioctl (for emulation of PKCS semantics) are allowed to be mixed into the pool (assuming the callers cred has sufficient privilege) but are considered to contribute exact 0 entropy credit to the pool state.
Solaris unlike Linux also doesn't expose any stats about the internal state of the whole rng subsystem to userspace.  The only way to find that out is being root with all privilege and using the kernel debugger.   Are we being too paranoid or should we expose to user space the current stats about what we believe the amount of entropy etc is ?
We don't do it on Solaris, however as part of our just completed FIPS 140-2 validation NIST asked is if we could do that. The reason they asked was they wanted to be sure that there was sufficient entropy available for when the first parts of the system start calling on a FIPS 186 PRNG to do key generation.
While I've written up an example system service that does this have no plans of integrating it into Solaris as default part of the product.
Given how rarely many server systems reboot and that fact that most critical key generation is more likely to be done on the first one or two boots afer intial install I think this is pointless anyway.

@_subject: [Cryptography] FW: RFC 7253 on The OCB Authenticated-Encryption 
I scanned over the intro of the RFC but couldn't see a reason to prefer OCB
over CCM or GCM.
If I already have a system where CCM or GCM can be chosen is there any
reason why I should consider adding OCB ?

@_subject: [Cryptography] How to crypto secure speed limit signs 
This won't work in the UK because you need context to interpret the
'national speed limit' sign which is a black diagonal line on a white
It could mean 60mph or 70mph depending on the road type.
Then there are the places where there are no signs and you need to
interpret the highway code to know what the limit would be: built up area,
street lights means 30mph.

@_subject: [Cryptography] HTTPS usage at major media sites 
One reason to force https on news sites though is so that the reader
benefits from authentication and integrity protection. Reducing the chance
that a MiTM attack is used to present fake or altered stories.
The above is one of the reasons why blogs.oracle.com only runs over https.
For a public news site in not so sure I see why someone would expect to
have any privacy over the metadata indicating what they read. If you need
that then you should read in private browsing mode over Tor (or equivalent)
- your browser state will be as leaky of that metadata than the channel.

Not sure off the top of my head if it is DAA but OpenStack Nova can use TPM
attestation as part of its VM placement rules.

@_subject: [Cryptography] XTS mode IV generation 
I'm looking for information on wither it is safe (not ideal) to use XTS
mode in a Copy On Write filesystem. For ZFS (which is copy on write and
always has a merkle tree of checksums)I used CCM or GCM because there was
space to store the IV and the MAC.
I have a use case where the system is still copy on write but there is no
possibility of storing the IV or a MAC.  In some (but not all) cases the
ciphertext of the blocks are still checksumed.
The blocks are not the traditional disk blocks of full disk encryption that
XTS is target for. Each block that would be encrypted by XTS is  referenced
by an 128 bit id.  What this means is that due to copy on write the same
128 bit id will be used again (always representing the same object and
fragment of the object) while the prior block is still lying on the storage
media.  If this 128 bit id was used as the IV for XTS is that weakening the
security of XTS ? Or is it really no different to the risk of being able to
observe the same disk locations over time when XTS is used in the
traditional full disk encryption case?

@_subject: [Cryptography] OpenSSL CSPRNG work 
In addition to the performance concerns and platforms (yes people really do
run modern OpenSSL, often bundled with layered software) on a 10 year old
OS)  OpenSSL needs to have its own DRBG inside it's own libraries for FIPS
140 validation reasons. For the FIPS case the only answer is having its own
implementation of a NIST approved DRBG.

@_subject: [Cryptography] TPM and SHA-1 
There have been some talks at the OpenStack conferences by people from HP
and Intel about using TPM attestation of a hypervisor host as part of the
VM placement criteria that Nova uses when scheduling where a VM is started
or moved to.
I have no idea if anyone is using that in production though.

@_subject: [Cryptography] WIPEONFORK in Linux 4.14 
Is the use case for when we are purposely creating a multi-process system,
by using fork/vfork/clone, where all the processes are running the same
Or is it about fork/exec? In this case an in kernel posix_spawn() avoids
many of the issues. Particularly those I've been involved with where the
JVM was using native crypto libraries and we were depending first on
getpid() and then on stacked pthread_atfork() handlers.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Transparent remote file access 
You say you don't trust your KDC admin but do you trust your DNS admin ?
What about the administrator of the naming service which is probably LDAP ?
Are you running LDAP over TLS ? How are you managing the certificate trust
anchors for LDAP so you know you are connecting to the correct servers?
I understand your concern with Kerberos but really it plus DNS and LDAP
(which is going to be present in almost all but the tiny deployments) all
need to be considered and probably need to be equivalently secured and
trusted. Which is why Microsoft having them all together in Active
Directory is often a good thing (see also IPA server)

@_subject: [Cryptography] Millions of high-security crypto keys crippled 
HP and Intel contributed code to OpenStack that uses the TPM for Nova
Compute node attestation that those nodes are configured appropriately.
This is then used as input to the Nova VM placement scheduler, it is I
believe also possible to mark a VM flavour as required to be placed on an
attested Nova Compute node.
I'm not convinced TPM was at all necessary for this case nor is it
addressing enough issues (what if the system gets compromised after the
attestation step).

@_subject: [Cryptography] IDs and licenses, 
That isn't quite correct.
A physical UK photo licence card is valid for 10 years. Your right to drive
is until a given age. Both dates are on the license.
The physical card needs to be renewed when you change address or when the
10 year card validity expires.
In fact there are actually many more dates on a UK (European format really)
license, including the date you passed various driving category tests.
When your card is renewed (always by post) you must cut the old one in half
and return it to the DVLA. Therr are no local DVLA offices in the UK like
there are DMV in the US.
