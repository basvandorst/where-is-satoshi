@_subject: [Cryptography] Patents and technology 
It has now been 25 years since I was involved with cryptography and related issues on a daily basis. But at that time, working for a couple of different Silicon Valley companies, we would never patent our best new ideas. By the time a patent was even very far along in consideration, much less being granted, technology would have moved far enough to make that idea obsolete, and in the patent process we would be telling the world (at least we had better assume that for safety) about our idea. So we relied on keeping our ideas secret until we had newer and better ones. Of course ideas that truly change the direction the world moves and will be critical for years would be good to patent, but details, even though they might be very important in the short run, we thought, were better off kept to ourselves.
So the reason for my post is: Has something really changed in the process? Or are all of these ideas truly game changing? Or is it a matter of gaming the system?

@_subject: [Cryptography] Rough Consensus Attack 
Several posts have noted how these arguments apply far outside cryptography. This quote was directly about crypto, but it reminds me of what an outside "expert" told us when I recently was on a local campaign committee, approximately this: Never say something the opponent has said is bad, just trumpet your own virtues. (I did not like the idea of letting our opponents have veto power over what we could say...) The idea is sort of: When somebody goes into the voting booth, you can't predict whether he/she will remember all of what you said or just the part you quoted from your opponent, thereby reinforcing his/her ads. (I'll leave it for you to compare that advice to the negative political ads that are so prevalent...)
The IETF and other standards groups we have to care about don't typically have voting booths (although they may implement other schemes intended to give ballot privacy). But regardless of whether you are the good guy or the attacker, you still run the risk of reinforcing your opponent's arguments when you mention them. So this strategy has some basis.

@_subject: [Cryptography] traffic analysis -> let's write an RFC?, 
I was told years ago that the cryptography group within NSA had as a standard that no crypto system could be considered secure unless I could give you all the details as to how it works and you still could not break it. There are probably people in this forum who could comment on that as history, but regardless of whether it is historically accurate it has always seemed to be a goal to strive for.

@_subject: [Cryptography] My ignorance and drive firmware hacking 
A couple of years ago I had a (Seagate, 1TB) disk drive in a PC "fail" and I could not tell what was wrong with it. I sent it to a company I had dealt with before who would attempt to recover data. (Some was backed up but not some other stuff I really cared about. Shame on me...) They did their job nicely, and their verdict on the drive was "firmware corruption". I had never before thought about the firmware being field rewritable. (I do remember the furor some years ago when PC motherboards first had field rewritable BIOS PROMs, and the risk of attack. Some had the nice feature that you could not write to the firmware without moving an on-board jumper: I fear that safety move has died out.)
So I wondered whether the firmware had simply changed due to some random glitch, we can always imagine a cosmic ray loosing a flash of electrons into a chip. I also wondered whether it was "malware" from some bad guy. Then I heard that many (I think thousands) of similar drives had failed in the same way. Now I have to wonder if it was somebody just learning to plant things in the firmware and not getting it quite right. Maybe I was better off losing the drive than having them succeed in planting something with more disastrous effects!

@_subject: [Cryptography] Reproducible results 
In the thread about "blockchain and trustworthy computing", Lodewijk andré de la porte said:
I am interested in whether that is actually being carried out as a standard procedure in any, or many, disciplines. I certainly don't object to it as a goal and hence as "supposed to be doing". But *Science* magazine, one of the major publishers of research articles in many scientific subjects, recently carried the suggestion that this ought to be done, as a reaction to the number of scientific papers that have been retracted (worldwide, not just in *Science*) recently. As a mathematician, where results don't usually depend on lab equipment and procedures, the whole discovery and publication activity is a little different from many of the subjects they publish. But, from what I read in *Science*, I got the impression this was not usually a condition for journal acceptance in any subject. Is that so?

@_subject: [Cryptography] Happy birthday, NSA! 
How many of us remember when the agency "came out" from having its existence and name secret? At national meetings, e.g. the American Mathematical Society's annual national meeting, where we wore name tags, the ones just identifying place of work as "Defense Department" were a giveaway that someone worked for the agency. Then one year there was an invited talk at the national AMS/MAA joint meeting by the agency's director of mathematical research (I am sorry that I cannot remember his name, it was a notable event!) titled "The Agency That Came In Out of The Cold".
But the window into what was happening inside the agency was still small and cloudy... Nowadays existence is well known, uniqueness is not so well known, and the window is still pretty limited. But I have been astounded by the widespread reaction to Snowden's release of information, where people who have been working in computing for decades said they were surprised. From decades ago I can remember discussions where we were sure that (a) whatever was the most powerful computing in the world, at least a sample of it was located in Fort Meade, and (b) if "they" wanted to read anything you had stored or transmitted as bits they would surely be able to.

Minor point: Any PCB of likely complexity will have more than two layers of conductive traces. The topological difficulties of getting all the "wires" to connect properly, without shorting to each other, in just one or two planes (the front and back of the board) become terribly complex. Related to  the "gas and water and power" graph that cannot be drawn in 2-D without lines crossing. So being able to see/photograph just the front and back is not enough. Your plastic would have to be accessible to that other topic we've got going, being able to read the inner pages of a book from the outside.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Tempest and limits on receiving 
Several posters seem to think that in the USA there are no restrictions on just listening, e.g.
Have you tried to buy a shortwave radio that covers all of the frequencies from, say, 100MHz to 10GHz? There are quite a few receivers that say they do that, until you look at the footnote saying that reception of certain frequencies is disabled, because the disabled frequencies are used by some cell 'phones. I admit I don't know where the law might be, but something is certainly causing all those manufacturers to remove that capability from their receivers. This applies to units sold in the USA but built elsewhere as well as those built here.
Since we don't have vans on the streets looking for radiation from receivers (the way Britain for a long time enforced the requirement to buy a radio receiving license), the easy way to enforce such a restriction is to place it on all equipment made for sale. You could presumably build your own receiver with whatever reception frequencies and modes you wanted, and wait to see if any such restrictions are being enforced in some other way.
(Note that I am specifically saying "receivers". Many of them are built into "transceivers" that combine a receiver and a transmitter, frequently designed for ham radio use, but the (a) limitation is on reception and (b) if the company makes a separate receive-only device for those frequencies, the same restriction will be included.)

@_subject: [Cryptography]  Tempest and limits on receiving 
Maybe I did not make my intent clear: I posted a comment that was intended to address the issue of whether the US put restrictions on receiving, as distinct from forms of transmission. Several posters had implied that listening was completely free, and I just meant to point out that was not so clear. Several have now emailed me to point out that the examples I gave (e.g. under many circumstances receiving equipment must not be capable of receiving cell 'phone transmissions) did not involve Tempest, which I certainly concede, but that was not what I was talking about. I have worked in "black" environments and do know a bit about Tempest, but I did not mean to involve that.
I am sorry if I did not emphasize that enough, and thus wasted bandwidth both by my original message and the replies it inspired.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Hong Kong store 
Jerry Leichter said regarding buying from a particular Hong Kong source:
Just to fill in the record: I dealt with that place several times and still have/use some photo equipment bought from them. That was "T M Chan and Company." My grad school friends and I would eagerly discuss Chan's latest offerings. Some of the official US importers did not seem to care about the fairly small competition Chan offered, e.g. I have a Gossen light meter that did not have any obliteration of the name Gossen it would have in the US, although the actual model name was what it got called in the rest of the world rather than here. Whoever was the official importer for Canon, though, made a big deal of it and friends who bought Canon equipment generally had to use it with name plates literally ground down to remove the engraved name. Customs would not let Canon gear in unless you traveled to the port bringing a file or other tool and obliterated the name. For models with plates held on by screws you could try to buy the plate as a replacement part from the official importer, but they caught on quickly.
What mattered was what the official importers threatened to do and whether customs workers actually did it. Government's involvement was to tell customs inspectors which companies had threatened what, and word quickly got around that you could import a particular brand through a given port with no problems, because the inspectors there were not enforcing the importer's request. That was still somewhat chancy, it was not easy for Chan to ship something with complete control over the port of entry. But they were quite friendly, I would exchange (pre email!) letters for example asking for a particular port. Much of this had to do with photographic equipment but it grew to include some electronics such as calculators and high fidelity equipment. The savings made the bother well worth going through, particularly on a grad student's income.
But photo magazines would definitely not even hint at this whole idea, since they got lots of ad money from the official importers who lost money if you bought through this channel!

In the discussion of whether /dev/urandom should fail and whether that should cause bootup to fail, it was stated:
Stacking possible solutions is certainly not a complete answer, but it is a good description of  a "brainstorming" phase that can be a very good part of software engineering! (Not just in this context...) Once you know that one of them is an /actual/ solution you might even be through, depending on the nature of the task. And until you know at least one, or maybe more possible solutions, you can hardly verify that one of them is an /actual/ solution.

That in turn includes a statement (which resembles a great many warranty Doesn't that use of "the useful life" amount to a tautology, i.e. "when it no longer does what you bought it for it is no longer useful"?
I don't think this is really off-topic since something equivalent to that tautological usage is probably contained or implied in what a manufacturer says about any of the products we work on!

@_subject: [Cryptography] The Bob Morris worm 
In case we forget it, that worm had three "methods" for trying to break into the next machine, once it was established on one. And one of those was just trying a surprisingly short list of passwords. "Back in the day" there were studies showing that on what there was of the net so far, a list of about 30 (it might even have been a little less) "words" would include a valid password on most (I remember numbers like 75%) of the systems that were connected. Such a list would include "Spock" and "password", and words from the game Adventure, and others that I hope would now bring more laughter than login success. From then on, for a while, every so often we would hear that a new survey showed that some small list would still work. Are there any data on how small a list would include a password working for some user on X% of all our systems these days? That might be a weak measure of how far our preaching about security practices has reached.

I don't know much detail, but I do remember half a dozen years ago (more or less) having a couple of Seagate HDDs go bad in a home system: I sent one to a professional place to recover data (It had been in use just a few days, no good backup program in place yet, :>(  ) and they diagnosed it as corrupted firmware. I was told they had already received a bunch of Seagate drives that had failed in the same way, that malware rewriting the firmware in the drive was suspected. I do know that firmware upgrades were being shipped to users in some group, so the ability to write was certainly there. Later I even found online a program that claimed it could check for authenticity of your drive firmware and arrange to install a corrected version. So as always there is "whom do you trust"...
Remember when easily upgradeable BIOS proms for PCs first hit the scene? At first you had to switch an on-board jumper to allow writing, but maybe that was too much work or the extra three cents for hardware was too expensive. This seems to me still a big vulnerability!
Maybe somebody on this list has more information...

@_subject: [Cryptography] Radio leakage from System 360/370 era machines 
In Volume 2, Issue 8, Henry Baker comments on "listening" to old mainframes using a radio:
In fact that was not an accident, in some cases it was a documented feature. It was a part of other systems, but my experience with it was with CDC 1604 and 3600 machinery. There was a speaker in the operator's console, driven by the upper octal digit of the accumulator. DC current proportional to that digit was fed through the speaker. As an example, if you put 0707070707070707 (sixteen digits octal, to fill the 48 bit register) in the A register and then rotated it left or right, delay, rotate, delay, etc. you got a square wave sound out of the speaker. More creative strings of digits could create lots of different sounds. I remember a diagnostic that CDC's onsite engineers ran that was called "Bagpipe", because that is what it sounded like.
I remember one programmer whose intense numeric calculations would make the speaker go quiet, because the A register was changing at a rate above human hearing during his intense computations. Operators had learned that if programs in general shut up the speaker it meant the machine was in a small tight loop, so they would interrupt the run and kick his program off the machine. So the first thing his code would do was to modify system code (this was before there was much in the way of separation between user code and system code, there was one big address space for us all to play in) and if the operator changed a switch setting so as to kick him off, he printed out on the console typewriter a message to keep their (text suppressed in interests of decency) hands off the switch, and telling the operator another way to stop the program if it were really necessary.
So if you consider that audio information as leakage, it was endorsed by the system designers! Also, listening that way or using a radio to listen in on activity with other machines was used to play music, back in the day when we had to demonstrate the machine to visitors.

Or was all of the "more critical" stuff contained in removable parts such as rotors, with some scheme to make sure their higher classification was separately recognized?

@_subject: [Cryptography] ham radio and encryption 
This discussion has probably gone on too long, but here are the defining documents. "Law" in this case comes from congressional establishment and empowering of the Federal Communications Commission. In general "Part 97" is what we as hams refer to for our permissions and obligations. The most relevant part of the FCC's regulations, so far as I see is:
As others have pointed out, that phrase "messages encoded for the purpose of obscuring their meaning" is what matters.
The "except as otherwise provided herein" has sometimes resulted in challenges as new technologies came along. E.g. when sending images perhaps as JPEG within something like the Winlink protocols for sending email, or simply television or radio-teletype transmissions, someone listening to the transmission would not understand the meaning but these are allowed. Sometimes these new technologies have been controversial, e.g. there were recent complaints by some hams about others using compression and noise reduction techniques such as FT8. I am not? at all a lawyer but I think the essence here has been that it is OK so long as ways to "decode" a transmission are publicly available. Some of the exceptions have been put in for things such as remotely controlling satellites, clearly not considered in the original rulings!
Regarding the "to keep hams from competing with commercial carriers" argument, there is this in the regulations immediately after the above, and still within "No amateur station shall transmit"

 From what I have read the rule against encryption for hams (such as I am) was put in because around the time of WWI there was fear people (not just hams, if they are in fact people) were leaking information to Germany.

I don't know whether there would be much opposition to removing the prohibition for hams now, but discussing that might lead us away into politics...

I do rely on my laser printers (in my case actually LED printers, but that doesn't change the image formation) for longevity. But there are also ink squirters made for photography that specify the longevity of their prints. Of course those are advertising claims to some extent and need to be read cautiously, but there are agreed on testing procedures. I have used an HP 8750, now use a Canon PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II. Epson makes some excellent photo printers also, beloved by some professional photographers, but they have had a reputation for print heads plugging up unless used constantly. The ones I have used claim longevity measured in centuries, if the prints are made on proper (i.e. manufacturer approved) paper using proper ink and stored properly. I don't know how that compares to laser prints.
