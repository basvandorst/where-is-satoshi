@_subject: [Cryptography] What if Responsible Encryption Back-Doors Were 
This blog rant answers the question.
"I present here a scheme that would allow concerned parties to decrypt
all communications and files incumbent to investigation of criminal
activity without violating the privacy rights of any government officials."

"How, or whom, best to trust time"
A notarized letter with the hash will set you back about two dollars
most places. A few coin will publish your hash in the classifieds of a
paper of record. Even better is to record your hash in a public notice
at a county records office and get a certified copy. All of these
methods are defacto proof of time in all courts of record.
Most especially the county recorder's office or courthouse is the
original blockchain. The records therein are defacto compliant with the
rules of evidence in all jurisdictions. If you have certified filings
there it's an obstacle to those who challenge the time of entry.
Speaking to the inconvenience, recall the old saw, "... death and taxes ..."

I like "DARE stub" and "DARE parcel." The DARE container may be a
container of parcels or a box/crib of stubs.
I would try to visualize something people are familiar with then extract
that structure and its terms to the virtual structure of your protocol.
Vide telegram, telegraph, radio, cable, wire, file cabinets, book
shelves, smoke signals, pigeons, etc.
Here are some possibilities:
parcel - parcel packet - stub - entry - chit - post - page - leaf - card
- message packet - word packet - communiqué - dispatch - dispatch packet
- missive - record - imprint - transcript - correspondence - article -
document - composition - broadcast

Privacy and Anonymity in Computation, Communication and Storage
Pay-to-Pub and pay-to-peek are like a toll road on information.
Modern-day, self-appointed aristocrats believe they have the divine
right to extract income from the people who actually make things.
The Pacer control (paywall garden) of USA court documents and West
Publishing's control of code and statute publishing are reminiscent of
the scheme herein alleged. Access to legal code and cryptic lawyerese is
controlled by the size of your pocketbook. They invent their own
interpretation of the code. They obscure the interpretation of the code.
They install trapdoors to capriciously alter the interpretation of the
code. They hold you accountable to this obscure and inaccessible code.
They control and limit your access to the code. Then they charge you
ridiculous fees to access the code, which should be a public record but
is held under private copyright. Then they re-interpret the code and
rule against you anyway after you paid and successfully argued that the
code supports your position.
Of course the damage done to poor litigants is massive. I believe the
motives behind both hijackings of information are similar. They turn
important and sacred things into marketplace commodities, then extort
from the very creators of the stolen or public goods.
