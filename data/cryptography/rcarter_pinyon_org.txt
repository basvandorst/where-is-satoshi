The same attack (and resulting complexity) is reported for AES - you get
about two bits for all of AES-128, 192, and 256.
I found a reference to a paper -  -
applying the biclique attack to a Korean standard algorithm known as
ARIA-256.  (It gets about 1 bit of advantage with 2^80 chosen plaintexts
- hardly a realistic attack right now.)
Who knows, the biclique technique may get broadened into a whole new
class of attacks on block ciphers, to add to our toolkit along with
differential and linear cryptanalysis and a few lesser-known ones.  Or
it may prove unable to go beyond the tiny advantages it can get today.
It should stand as a warning, though, that new analytic techniques are
always "just around the corner".
