@_subject: World's most powerful supercomputer goes online 
That's quite an interesting thing to ponder, but don't forget that only some supercomputer applications (like crypto!) can be handled well by this sort of highly distributed system.  There is more to most "real supercomputers" than just MHz times number of CPUs - there is also very high-speed data communications and sharing between those multiple CPUs. The botnet does not have that, so it is limited to working on problems that can be completely divided into independent pieces of work where there is little or no need to pass data between the CPUs.  If you're trying to do an exhaustive key search, however, it looks like a pretty attractive thing to use.

Our IBM cryptographic processors (HSMs) have been using this technique since around 1996 - data that is stored in flash memory is encrypted with a key that is destroyed on any attempt to tamper with the security module.

Hat tip to a party who prefers to remain anonymous who sent me the
patent number.
