If taking this approach it has to use a commitment scheme, or the orgainizer can
change the result trivialy. It would mean joinging the lottery takes more effort
tho, which is undesirable. Ideally only the orgainizer and someone that want to
verify the result need to do extra work.
Since we only really need one honest participants, which can be the people that
want to verify the result. maybe we can do something like the following.
The orgainizer commits to a random string as fallback (in case no one wanted to
verify), and participants that wishes to verify commits to a random string as
For each participant, the orgainizer gives them an anonymous identifier that is
the salted hash of their username, for those that commited, the orgainizer
publishes the anonymous identifier with their commitment.
After the list is compiled, everyone that did commit a string reveals their
answer, which all get XORed together and used as the key to a MAC function.
Using the MAC function each participants gets their score (the MAC tag of their
anonymous identifier), and the lowest N wins.
The winner still needs to have their identity revealed, and the salt as well, to
guard against fake entries. It is of course possible to create fake account as
well, but I don't think it's possible to stop those types of attacks, be it a
real lottery or a virtual one :(
IDK why I haven't thought about using an anonymous identifier to get around the
whole publish the participants problem. lol

Now there are a lot of online lotteries, or giveaways, usually they would
involve and trusted third party to draw the prize, yet there's little to no
reason those third party should be trusted. To me, a good lottery scheme have
these properties:
 1. No need to trust the organizer
 2. No need to trust the participants
 3. No need to trust any third party
 4. Results are random
 5. Cannot be set in a way that favors some participants
 6. Cannot be set in a way that exclude some participants
 7. Do not need to publish the list of participants
 8. Participants can prove they did or did not win
 9. Participants can prove to others they did or did not win
10. Can set any number of winners
11. Can set tiers of winners
12. Easy to implement
13. Fast to compute
14. Fun
The solution I came up with is follows:
Post the following info:
  A Lottery name, this needs to be unique each time
  MAC tag of a chosen "lucky number"
  The number of winners
When participants sign-up, they are given some sort of proof for joining,
"Lottery name + username" signed with the organizer's keypair (for example)
Calculate participants' score from their unique username
  score = min(hash(1, , ),
              hash(2, , ),
              ...,
              hash(, , ))
Winners are the participants with the lowest scores.
Announce the winner, the lucky number with the MAC key used to generate the tag
The rationale for the repeated hashing is that since the randomness are picked
by the organizer, there's no way to stop them from favoring someone by trying
possible lucky numbers. Therefore with this scheme, they would need to give
everyone else at least the same number of tries, making picking favorites
My scheme implementation of this idea

Yes, each participants gets  many hashes, and their score is the
lowest of the bunch, for each hash, only the number used change, lottery name
and username say the same.
The idea was that for a given username, the organizer can pick the lucky number
to give it a good score, and the number of times he tries to get that lucky
number is upper-bounded by the number itself, so it gives everyone else at least
the same number of tries.
However, the usernames does let the organizer try however many times they wishes
while not increasing the lucky number. That's a problem. I mean it would be
fairly obvious that the account corresponding to the username was fake. but it's
still a big problem in the scheme.
I need to think about this more, it seems pretty hard to avoid since it's
basically increasing the number of times you participate in the lottery, which
is always going to work for any lottery scheme.
The lucky number could have been public, yes. But it would ruin the fun since
people can see what score they'll get before the reveal, and therefore affects
the number of participants.
ofc this is not considering the problem from above :(
That was a bad choice of word, yeah

yeah, I thought about using something similar like everyone giving the organizer
a random number between 0 and 1, and the random number is the decimal part of
the sum, so as long as there is one random input the result is going to be
random. The problem with this is that it would require the organizer to publish
the list of participants.
I had a quick go over with the coin flip procedure, it seems like it does
require the list of participants as well.
