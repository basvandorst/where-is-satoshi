Since we know  that these terrorists use steganography, they could be sending
messages hidden in the contents of the letters, classifieds, or even the editorial
Therefore, the solution is clear.
All printed matter must be reviewed by a team of crack government cryptographers
prior to publishing.  These cryptographers will be able to ensure that no hidden
content, or subtext, is present in any of the Observer's editorial content.
Some of the radical fringe will object to this plan, but surely the Observer will be
first in line to participate, to protect our way of lfe.

@_subject: bin Laden's alleged stego & provos/honey paper 
The paper concludes that either "there is not much stego on the net,"
or "it's a different kind of stego", or "stego users choose good
passwords."  A fourth possibility is that "we used the wrong
dictionary."  But I suspect that "love", "hockey", and "jesus" probably
aren't the top choices for passwords among Islamist terrorist cells.
Assuming that the authors were trying to substantiate rumors of stego
use by Islamist terrorists, one imagines they would use Arabic/Farsi
dictionaries and a copy of the Quran.    Perhaps I'm misrembering the
cant of the Februrary 2000 rumors?

cute.  The flaw in your logic is that the original statement was an
implication, not an equivalance.
