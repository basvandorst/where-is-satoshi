Hardly. Just perform DH exchange over the interlock protocol. By your
own admission, the MITM could not change the factors being exchanged,
and by DH, the MITM cannot then know what the resulting key data is.

Yes it is. An anonymous system can be constructed from a pseudonymous
system by never reusing a pseudonym.

Just a quick sanity check for me... what stops you simply faking this
"attestation" and running a compromised system?

Is there really that much space for marking? Any substantial number of
marked bits will become obvious in the output stream, no?

It is the case, however, that EFS does not zero out spare space in a
cluster. So if you encrypt a file, it can leak plaintext.

Why should I trust you? Filtering xn--* domains works for me, and
doesn't require that I turn my browser over to unreviewed, possibly
buggy code.

That only authenticates that Amir wrote the code, not that the code is
*This* is a reasonable argument, but I'd prefer a second-party review
before I install anything.
Then again, the only extension I have installed (FlashGot), I manually
checked myself.

Unfortunately for your analysis, *entropy* assumes that there is
infinite compute capacity. From an information-theoretic point of view,
there is NO SUCH THING as a perfect one-way function.

I think this last bit is untrue. You will find that the expected number
of states of the PRNG after extracting one bit of randomness is half of
the number of states you had before, thus resulting in one bit of
entropy loss.

If you want encryption with authentication, there's the gaim-encryption
plugin. I get the feeling gaim-otr is for more specific circumstances.
