I hope this isn't too off-topic, but for somebody looking for open-source,
hardware TRNG for real-world server use, the selection is abysmally low. In
fact I can only find two: a single person in San Francisco making them by
hand , and the
onerng , which became available just *this month!*
I don't know how practical Mr. Baker's initial design would be to implement
on silicon, but my hope is the spitballing will eventually trickle down
into additional open-source TRNG designs.

Phillip, can you please clarify where this requirement came from? There is
some confusion about whether this type of thing is required on all of us,
or if you're following some procedure to use your library within the
federal government.
I'd wager a guess that it's the latter.

decided to delay the deadline for migration from Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
to Transport Layer Security (TLS) [...] Now the Council says it's just too
hard for retailers to make the jump.
Speaking purely of point-of-sale systems, can someone help me understand
why the payment card industry is still dealing with the problem of trusted
and untrusted networks? Hasn't this problem been largely solved by
transaction tokenization?
DNS servers are able to make zone updates across the public internet via
TSIG[0]. And if my understanding of Apple Pay is correct, the tokenization
system is agnostic to the POS transport protocol and should allow trusted
transactions even on untrusted networks[1].
I can't help but feel we are squandering the opportunity to upgrade both
the POS terminals _and_ payment card industry during the rollout of EMV POS
terminals happening right now in the US.

I believe that's a job for the NIST. The lawsuit specifically mentions
HIPAA[0]. At this point the FTC essentially does what the FDA does for
food: "Your label said "strong crypto" but we couldn't find it in the

Thanks, Bill. This is a fun write-up.
TrueRandom does, and drive a voltage onto pin 0, and measure it with the
8-bit ADC.  While sometimes this generates unpredictable data, the scatter
plots show scary correlations, and the one thing we know it is not
measuring is thermal noise.
Is there any way you could mitigate this by diversifying board pins, for
example read from pin 0 and 5 and XOR the data together?

that don't come with a proper entropy source built in.
What options do we have? I know that the RPI comes with a built-in hwrng,
but it runs an actual OS that requires crypto functionality. As far as I
know it's still a black box, so there's lingering problems with that.
It would be nice to put pressure on Arduino, but it's my opinion that more
sophisticated projects are already moving on to raspberry pi.

and the built in hardware.   Even if the built in hardware has issues
a modest amount of noise from something else (anything) can help.
I've found the built-in HWRNG to be useful but not sufficient for
applications that demand high throughput. Isn't the idea always to take a
certain of amount of data and then seed and refeed a CSPRNG?
This isn't directed at anyone in particular, but I think Bill's research is
very valuable work, even if it doesn't yield such a device. How much
entropy is needed to properly seed a CSPRNG? This[0] stack-exchange
question suggests at it being ~128 bits. Going from known state --> 16
bytes of honest-to-goodness random data --> CSPRNG would open up the
Arduino to a lot of interesting applications.
makes sense for a I2C device costing pennies to hit the market.
I agree and have wondered out loud why we have no such device! Bill himself
makes an inexpensive TRNG[1] (that's currently in stock!), there's also the
OneRNG which I own and use. Both of these devices target linux hosts and
not IoT.
Maybe someone with better electronics experience can chime in, but I'm very
curious about the minimum amount of hardware required to build a TRNG for
IoT devices such as the Arduino.

Interesting. Wouldn't such a circuit still exhibit a bias and variance
between units that required whitening? Could that be accomplished so that
each Arduino/IoT-stick was able to generate random data without additional
