A right is a power whose use you can defend by force if necessary.
Absent your ability to defend the right, it vanishes and disappears.
Even the The Universal Declaration of Human Rights makes this clear:
    âWhereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have
    recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression,
    that human rights should be protected by the rule of lawâ
The Constitution was "descriptive law"--it described a power balance
between the state and the people based on the technology of the 1700s.
The printing press and the rifle gave us rights, and the internet
takes them away.
If you do not like living under the current state of tyranny and
oppression, then let's invent new technologies that swing the balance back in our favor.

Is this feudalism?
Feudalism was a system of government (or protection racket, take your
pick) in which armored thugs on horseback ("lords") protected their vassals
Apple protects the peasants, but must pay fealty in turn to the
might-is-right gangsters at the FBI.
Does this metaphor seem useful to you in terms of better understanding
the problem, and explaining it to lay people?
Thoughts welcome on or off list.

George Orwell endorsed the idea that the invention of the stirrup
created feudalism in Europe:
    Thugs on horseback took power and held it until new technology disrupted
their power base.
Something similar appears to be happening now.
Question: How can we innovate democratic technology to disrupt
the FBI's new role at the top of the feudal pecking order?

With all due respect, Dan Geer works for the surveillance state. After six months of reading his posts to various mailing lists, I have come to the reluctant conclusion that everything he says must be parsed through a spook filter to figure out how whatever view he espouses promotes espiocracy at the expense of political liberty and democracy.
This is an incredibly dangerous way of thinking. By this logic, the kill list ("Disposition Matrix") can be justified as "a little light pruning." Better to kill America's political enemies and justify it as in the interest of the species than to actually give people the freedom they were promised.
Only by holding the rights of the individual inviolate can society
restore and maintain the ideals America was founded on. Until then, the virus of empire rules the day.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Use Linux for its security 
That's a lot of givens. :)
The one big takeaway I'd like to offer here, after being locked in a
room for two days at the Linux Security Summit, is this:
The problem is political, not technical.
The solutions you outline are difficult but technically achievable.
That is clear. The real problem is the current governance structure
of Linux.
No one could reasonably accuse Linus Torvalds of poor stewardship, and
certainly not of a lack of good intentions. But the benevolent
dictatorship model is creaking under the strain.
If you care about this problem, I would urge you to divide your time
equally between solving the technical challenges and confronting
the political ones. Without core leadership that prioritizes security, proposed technical
solutions are likely to languish for years, as Brad Spengler has discovered the hard way.

Malice motivated GCHQ's dirty tricks unit, JTRIG, to engage in similar
cell phone shenanigans.
According to the Snowden docs, dirty tricks "effects" ops have become
a major part of the GCHQ's activities, including:
        BURLESQUE "is the capabiltiy to send spoofed SMS text messages."
        CANNONBALL "is the capability to send repeated text messages to a
        single target."
        IMPERIAL BARGE "For connecting two target phone together in a call."
        and many more [0]
Their motive is pure malice:
        Change the photos on their social networking sites...you have
        been warned "JTRIG is about!!"
        Can take paranoia to a whole new level [1]
The documents I quote are from 2012, and we may be sure that the
malice cultivated by GCHQ has only gotten more evil--and that similar
capabilities have emerged at spy agencies elsewhere around the world.
Jumping to the conclusion that all possible cell phone malfunction is
a JTRIG op would of course be foolish, but it would be equally foolish
to stick our heads in the sand and pretend such malice does not exist
in the world.

The FBI and some local police departments are almost certainly using
TEMPEST attacks ("the van across the street") to investigate crime /
thought crime, in the same way they use Stingrays in secret.

on how law enforcement are using TEMPEST attacks domestically in the

The men who founded the United States used the phrase "live free or
die" as a battle cry. That may have been propaganda, but I consider it
a life choice. Life without liberty is not worth living.
A world in which secret police park vans across the street to spy on
us is worse than living in the Soviet Union.
I repeat: If you have evidence that proves unconstitutional
surveillance using TEMPEST attacks in the US, then please find me to
share that evidence.
