@_subject: Canonical LAN Manager hash algorithm specification? 
Hi all,
Sorry to spam the list like this, but I was wondering if anyone had pointers to the canonical references for the various versions of the LAN Manager protocols and their respective hash algorithms. I've just re-read through RFCs 1994, 2433, and 2759 but have thus far been unable to find "the" specification for LAN Manager hash algorithms as used in the different revisions of the protocol.
Any pointers would be much appreciated.
