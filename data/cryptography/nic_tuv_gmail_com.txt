I'm writing to the list to amend my previous answer regarding OpenSSL
TLS support for binary curves.
I wrote
This part is incorrect. Binary curves are technically supported by
libssl, and what I said applies only to curves defined via explicit
parameters (vs. named curves).
It is possible to verify I was mistaken looking at:
The link is also useful to check support in previous versions looking
at the history of that code.
Regarding the upcoming 3.0 release, as I am writing this email,
support for binary curves in TLS is still available.
I apologize for the confusion!
The rest of the paragraph still stands anyway:
In general, the main points of the original mail that Rich shared on
my behalf are still valid, despite the mistake above, and as James
highlighted with snippets from relevant documents, the standards
deprecating support for binary curves are consistent in the remarks
about limited adoption.
