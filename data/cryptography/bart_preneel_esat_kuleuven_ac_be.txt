Choose a group of prime order.
Choose t random group elements g_i (1 <= i <= t) different from 1.
Write input x as x_1 || x_2 || ... || x_t
prepend a 1 bit to each x_i giving z_i
f:(x)= g_1^z_1 . g_2^z_2 . .... . g_t^z^t

In order to increase hardware efficiency, the 8-bit S-boxes of Anubis
have been designed by combining 4-bit S-boxes with bit permutations in
two layers.  4-bit S-boxes always have quadratic equations.
Hence if you would be worried about algebraic attacks on AES, you probably
should also worry about Anubis.
However, the BES trick of Murphy and Robshaw (Crypto 2002) does not
apply as the S-box is not longer derived from the inverse mapping.
For more details on Anubis and Khazad, see the NESSIE report at
 and the paper at FSE 2003 of De Canniere et al.
and of Biryukov.

@_subject: how to phase in new hash algorithms? 
As ex-NESSIE project manager: NESSIE was an EU-funded research project
with funding for 40 months (2000-2003). The "NESSIE guys" still exist as
individual organizations but the NESSIE project is no longer in existence.
There is a follow-up, but with somewhat different goals, called ECRYPT
( We are organizing a kind of stream cipher
competition. On June 23-24 there will be a workshop on hash functions
in Przegorzaly (Krakow), Poland.
Xiaoyun Wang, Eli Biham, and Hans Dobbertin are invited speakers.
  Deadline for submissions: 1st May 2005
  Early registration deadline: 31st May 2005
We plan to discuss at this workshop also the way to go forward on hash
functions (for example, should there be a new competition for hash functions?).
Organizing this kind of competitions is beyond the current scope and
financial means of IACR, but IACR could consider to sponsor events
related to such an activity.
