require cutting a second set of masks. chips since the client would detect also often inspects the masks before that level.
A backdoor -- hardware or software -- in a smart card or TPM would be
difficult to detect by either of these means.  In the case that nation A is
buying these from nation F, don't you think that nation F would be motivated
to slip in a couple extra lines of code or a couple extra 100 gates just in
case?  If A got into a tangle with C, F would in a very strong position.

@_subject: Dutch Transport Card Broken 
The 24C3 presenters to their credit made this exact point. But mixing the
16-bit nonce with the card identifier was an optimization too far.  That
said, it's a hard problem.  Inside Picopass is one of many examples that
progress is possible.
IMHO as always.

@_subject: New result in predicate encryption: disjunction support 
Those interested in predicate encryption might also enjoy Group Authentication Using The Naccache-Stern Public-Key Cryptosystem which takes a different approach and handles negation.
A group authentication protocol authenticates pre-defined groups of
individuals such that: - No individual is identified - No knowledge of which groups can be successfully authenticated is known to
the verifier - No sensitive data is exposed The paper presents a group authentication protocol based on splitting the
private keys of the Naccache-Stern public-key cryptosystem in such a way
that the Boolean expression defining the authenticable groups is implicit in
the split

@_subject: New result in predicate encryption: disjunction support 
A group member asked me to elaborate on:
What this tries to say is that the verifier doesn't need to have a list of
all authenticable groups nor can the verifier draw any conclusions about
other authenticable groups based on authenticating one group.
One useful application of the Katz/Sahai/Waters work is a counter to traffic
analysis.  One can send the same message to everyone but ensure that only a
defined subset can read the message by proper key management.  What is less
clear is how to ensure that decrytion with the wrong key doesn't yield an
understandable (and actionable) message.

What I meant was that the crypogram decrypted with a correct f(I)=1 key
yields the encrypted message "Meet you at Starbucks at noon 0000000000000"
whereas decryption with a wrong, f(I)=0, key yields "Let's go down to Taco
Bell at midnight".  Padding with 0's doesn't help.

This is actually pretty easy to do by, e.g., padding all valid messages with
sufficiently-many 0s. Decryption with an incorrect key will result in
something "random" that is unlikely to end with the requisite number of 0s
(and so will be discarded).

@_subject: OpenSparc -- the open source chip (except for the crypto parts) 
This is an unsolved problem for code in tamper-resistant devices.  There are
precious few procedures to, for example, determine that the CAC card that
was issued to Pfc. Sally Green this morning bears any relationship
whatsoever to the code that went through FIPS certification. (A hash of the
code is meaningless since the card will simply burp up the right answer.)  I
have seen one such procedure but I have never seen any such procedure
implemented in real cards.
And to Marcos' point, not only do certification labs not look for backdoors
but I once had an employee of such a lab tell me that even if they found one
the are not obliged to enter this in their report unless, of course, they
had been explicitly requested to test for the absence of backdoors.  In that
regard, I have never seen a security profile that contained a claim of no
backdoors.  And I guess you know who is paying big bucks for the
certification report. Smart cards from F.  TPMs from C.  A 'sleep at the wheel.

@_subject: Property RIghts in Keys 
It seems to me that a cryptographic key is property in the same sense that
the formula for Coca Cola is property.  A cryptographic key is
intellectual property. This intellectual property is typically protected
as a trade secret.
Intellectual property need not be brought into being by a creative act.
A key has value that includes the value of the resources expended in its
care and feeding.  Monetary losses including the value of the key and the
value of the assets that the key protects may be suffered if they fall
into unauthorized hands.  Liability accrues unauthorized possession of a
key both to the possessor and to the entity charged with ensuring that
unauthorized possession did not occur.
In summary, it seems to me that the assertion that one owns a key has
commonly understood meaning and thus some nature of property rights do
attach to a cryptographic key.

@_subject: Property RIghts in Keys 
If anybody can alter, revoke or reissue a certificate then I agree it is
common property to which attaches no meaningful notion of property rights.
If on the other hand only certain people can alter, revoke or reissue a
certificate then it seems to me they have some sort of property rights in
the certificate and from their point of view the certificate is their
property and not everybody's property.
Whether it is intellectual property or some other form of property or even
some new form of property is I also agree debatable.

@_subject: Shamir secret sharing and information theoretic security 
Is it possible that the amount of information that the knowledge of a
sub-threshold number of Shamir fragments leaks in finite precision setting
depends on the finite precision implementation?
For example, if you know 2 of a 3 of 5 splitting and you also know that
the finite precision setting in which the fragments will be used is IEEE
32-bit floating point or GNU bignum can you narrow down the search for the
key relative to knowing no fragments and nothing about the finite
precision implementation?

@_subject: Crypto dongles to secure online transactions 
The FINREAD smart card reader was a European run at moving trust-bearing
transactions to an outboard device. It was a full Java VM in a
tamper-resistant box with a modest GUI, biometrics, lots of security on the
I/O ports and much attention to application isolation. FINREAD readers were
produced and an attempt was made to make its specifications into an ISO/IEC
standard. I don't know why it didn't get any traction but suspect that it
was more on business grounds than on technical grounds.  Telling folks they
had to buy a $100 card reader that was controlled and monetized by one
particular bank wasn't exactly a compelling offer.  Recently GlobalPlatform has reinvigorated the STIP reader effort which is
from 35K feet the same thing.  GP took over STIP in 2004.  Google or Bing
for details.
As Dan Geer as observed over the years, reducing bank risk is not a consumer

@_subject: [Cryptography] The First Open Source: Collected Algorithms from CACM 
In re open source and code quality, the Algorithms column of the Communications of the ACM published both Certification and Remarks submissions in addition to source code submissions.  Certifications documented successful implementations of previously published code and Remarks documented improvements, extensions, &c.
The first code submission was an integration routine, QuadI.  It was 18 lines long.  The second was Rootfinder.  It was 10 lines long. Perhaps not surprisingly, as code submissions got longer Certification and Remarks submissions became fewer.
All the code from the CACM Algorithms column is available at  and judging from the posted download statistics ( it is still widely used.  There is a history here waiting to be written.
I'm not sure what certification and remarks might mean if anything in today's open source world but the desirability of checks and balances on open source goes back to February of 1960.

Testing (probabilistically, of course) that the code you're running is the code that was certified without your having any visibility into the code itself.  The ZKP bits have to have been added by the certification authority to enable you to do this. Think smart cards.
