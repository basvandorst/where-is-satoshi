I like Jtan  .  I think they deserve a look.
They have a real shell and ssh access (not a cpanel, etc.) .
They know how, and can use pgp (gpg) if you need it.
They accept bitcoin.  I actually paid them with e-gold a long time ago.
They are very knowledgeable (some of them are open-source developers) .
You may talk to a real person (but email preferred, of course) .
Good luck.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Ken Thompson's password 
If you do not read Hacker News (
you might have missed this;
"Somewhere around 2014 I found an /etc/passwd file in some dumps of the BSD 3 source tree, containing passwords of all the old timers such as Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, Brian W. Kernighan, Steve Bourne and Bill Joy.
Since the DES-based crypt(3) algorithm used for these hashes is well known

@_subject: [Cryptography] looking for a word 
Or plagiarize..
I like that word very much.? It carries the notions of copying and of dishonesty.
It is very much widespread and understood. I haven't seen that word in this context but
if you add an "e-" in front like "email", you might be able to create a new word
at low cost.
The word comes from Latin word "plagiarius" (literally "kidnapper") and
I do not like that word in this context.? For me, that word is not a complete copy it is
closer to "characteristics left out" as in "The map is not the territory -- Korzybski" or
as "a brief summary of a research article".
