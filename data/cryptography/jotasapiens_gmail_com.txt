@_subject: [Cryptography] PQ Crypto: new hash-bases signature schemes 
I've been working on some new (hash-based) post-quantum signature schemes:
# Unbalanced Winternitz Signatures
Abstract: We introduce 'uwots' (unbalanced Winternitz one-time signatures):
an optimized, tweakable generalization of the Winternitz signature scheme.
# Integer Composition Signatures
Abstract: We introduce integer composition signatures (ic): a hash-based
family of one-time signatures. The family shows improvements over previous
schemes like Winternitz: less costly/shorter signatures, verification in
constant time, and tweakable parameters allowing optimization for either
A python inplementation of the scheme is also available.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Many-times signatures, faster than one 
Hi all,
I want to share some interesting improvements on hash-based-signatures that
I've found.
In typical signatures schemes (for example DSA, ECDSA) one is able to
generate an arbitrary number of signatures, and the size of each signatures
is constant and independent on the number of signatures.
That's not the case with hash-based signatures.  In signatures the size and
cost depend on the number of signatures:
Hash-based based signatures use a one-time signature (OTS) as its building
block, only useful to sign one message per key. The one-time signature is
then transformed into a many-times scheme using a Merkle tree (or a modern
variant, for example XMSS). As the number of needed signatures grows, the
tree gets larger. As a result , the cost and the size of the signatures
increase as well. They can get quite big compared to classical schemes.
The improvement follows from studying signatures in a blockchain, where all
signatures become public. In the paper I show that it is possible to
construct many-times signatures more efficient on than an OTS. As the
number of signatures grows, the signatures become more and more efficient.
This is quite unlike previous schemes.
If keys are used to sign a sufficient number of messages, they can
outperform classical signatures by a wide margin.
For anyone interested, it's explained in more detail here:

@_subject: [Cryptography] Improving SHPINCS with integer compositions 
Hi. I'd like to share some improvements over SPHINCS, that I think
might be useful.
There is a well known connection between hash-based signatures and
combinatorics, since  nearly all schemes use Merkle trees. But there
is another: we can also draw a connection to the composition of
Below is a simple description explaining how integer compositions can
be used to build a one-time signature. I've posted here about it
before. It's more efficient than WOTS. And tough it uses hash chains
just like WOTS, it is actually a generalization of the Lamport OTS.
Also, I add a connection between compositions and the few-times
signatures HORS/PORS.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Bitcoin With Heterogeneous Block Sizes (A Scaling 
These last months I've been working on a Bitcoin generalization to tackle
the problem of scalability without eroding decentralization. The paper is
below. I'm looking for others interested in the idea, who want to work on
the implementation, and on further research. Hopefully in an existing coin.
Here's a short overview:
The block size problem is well known. If blocks are small there is not
enough room for transactions, and fees rise. As blocks get increasingly
larger fewer nodes are capable of processing them and hashing power gets
more concentrated, increasing the success probability of an attack. The
block size set a trade-off between decentralization and transactions
Heterogeneous blocks is a proposal to solve this with a generalization of
Bitcoin. Instead of imposing a single size, a block is redefined as a
series of sub-blocks of increasing sizes, each doubling the total size up
to that point: 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32... The sub-blocks in the series exist
as different compromises between decentralization and throughput.
Each miner decides a cutoff in the series, and processes sub-blocks up to
that point. For example, a miner that choses a to process 4 sub-blocks,
will generate blocks containing the first 4 sub-blocks (with sizes 1, 1, 2,
4), and will process the first 4 sub-blocks at most from blocks generated
by others. On the other hand, users choose the sub-block size to use
individually for each address and transaction.
The construction has these properties:
- The network reaches consensus despite that not all miners observe the
blocks completely.
- Big blocks don't affect the security of small blocks, and bigger
sub-blocks don't affect the security of smaller sub-blocks.
- It is possible to move coins between the different sub-blocks.
Heterogeneous blocks can be seen as a having Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash in a
same chain, each serving different use cases. The smallest sub-blocks are
the most secure to store savings. The biggest sub-blocks are better for
small everyday payments, at the risk of more centralization. And in between
there is a whole range of trade-offs between the two.
