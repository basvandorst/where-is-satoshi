I am attemping the challenge 4 the code can decrypt the correct message, but I can't extract this message, because the lowest score I am getting is zero for some unknow reason, which is giving me the wrong result.
I am using the chi square test to analise the english letter frequencies. the codes written in python, for C4 and the others needed in the context are posted in the links below.
Any help would be very well appreciate.
