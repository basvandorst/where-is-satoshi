@_subject: [Cryptography] Will We Ever Learn? 
We did learn (partly). Everybody who was sane decided that the whole id of a bloated suid sendmail binary (also deamon) was a spectaculair bad idea, and
jumped on board Wietse Venema's Postfix (the MTA that was explicitly written
to be a secure, sane, save replacement of sendmail (some people choose DJB's
Qmail, which is also ok, but Bernstein's attitude complicated things). Then there were people that didn't learn, and although they choose a replacement, they choose something with exactly the same bad design (Exim).
So, yes .. the people that where affected *did* (mostly) learn from the Morris worm.
Same story with BIND (although BIND is not so crappy as Sendmail was).
The Windows world was a bit later, because Windows Sysops are more likely
to be sheep that will run anything as long as it's made by MS, no matter how often they get burned (IIS). (To be honest: Windows sysops know that they are payed to run and maintain MS products, not to make sure that the
best choise for the organisation is made. That choice was made by upper

Might I disagree? Facts on the ground say that C is still the most used
low-level language:
s disagree with the ACM article (outline). Spectre and Meltdown are *CPU bugs*, which would also have affected you if you where programming in assembly (duh). The 'features' that led to the bugs where things like branch prediction (something that is happening in the CPU, invisible for
the machine code above) and is totally independent of the language used. Is there any language which was not affected by Spectre and Meltdown? No.

I've been building spam-filter clusters for quite some time, and
although I appriciate new people trying to cut their teeth on the spam
problem (and moving the field forward), i'm a bit sceptical about this For the record: I stopped creating anti-spam clusters a couple of years ago
(This because I became a bit to cynical for my own taste, and chasing spammers can be temporary fun, but is a waste of time nontheless). The reason I'm sceptical is that there is no real difference betweel
this proposal, and all the earlier 'e-stamp / proof-of-work proposals'
i've seen before.
Also: I don't think you really understand what the problem is with The problem of how to live in a spam-free world has allready been solved.
The solution is simply invite only (whitelisting .. in an ideal world this would be done by a PGP web of trust kind of system). But the problem then becomes how to deal with people / messages that are not whitelisted / denied yet (invite's).
2nd: If whitelisting is the solution, then why do we still have spam? It's no coincidense that almost all social networks use invitation only. But the fact that mail is 'open' (not just in the sense that anybody
can try to send a message, but also that it's a open federated network), is one of the few benefits email has left. These 2 properties keep it from
being whiped out by closed social networks.
So email is still around because invite only has no good solution to the 'introduction problem'.
Also: mail filtering has evolved from simply trying to filter the bad stuff out.
You might think that email is a simple message system, where 'bad mail' (spam, virii) are simple filtered, and the rest is allowded to pass though,
but this is not a correct image. In reality :
some mail is ok (sender whitelisted.. 90% of ham ) Some mail is known bad (sender blacklisted, 90% of spam ) And the rest is grey.. and this grey mail is the problem.
Some people see this mail as spam, and some do not. A spam filter is not a system that is trying to determine absolutely what a mail is, but
a classifier that trys to keep the amount of 'corrective voting actions'
of it's users to a minimum. (unless it's required to protect the users,
in that case they get no vote, or the vote is overruled).
A SPAM-FILTER IS NOT A ARBITER OF ABSOLUTE TRUTH!! IT'S A SYSTEM
THAT IS TRYING TO SECOND GUESS WHAT IT IS THAT *YOU* WANT TO SEE IN
YOUR INBOX / SPAMBOX. IT's HIGHLY PERSONALISED, AND TRYING TO SECOND
GUESS YOU.  WHy did earlier e-postage schema's fail? * They don't understand email's fundamental strenght is that is not   invite only
* They require adjustments in the SMTP protocol * They have no (or no adequate ) penalty for fallback behavior
Say I where to implement your schema (as the first person on the internet).
I now have to choice about what to do clients that do not implement P-SMTP.
I choose to reject all email from those clients => I get no mail whatsoever
Or :
I choose to also accept old smtp mail. If I don't do this I will lose mail,
especcialy in the beginning. But if I (and everybody else that implements P-SMTP) also accepts plain old
smtp, then why would anybody bother to pay to get mail delivered? Say that mail that doesn't pay get send to a SPAMBOX / GREYBOX .. The users
will 'vote' this mail out of the spam / greybox, into the inbox (because that is what spamfilters do).
So why bother with paying for mail? Legitimate mail will be voted in the inbox
no matter what (whitelisted), and unwanted mail can pay as much as it wants,
but it will still be voted into the doghouse, no matter what.
Kind regards,

Of course it does. If I want to spam people, and I'm willing to pay a bit more,
I could do this under a P-SMTP schema. It would simply rise spam prices, not eliminate them.
So spamming al CEO's of all fortune 100 company's would cost 1 dollar instead of
of 0.0001 dollar .. big deal. In other words: spam would still exist, but it would
be more targeted, because it would be to expensive otherwise.
I would still 'vote' spam into the spambox, because I don't care that the sender
paid for it. It's still digital crap I don't want to receive (to put it mildly).

Really? How? And if there is a working global reputation system, then why not use this system instead of pSMTP? There is no such thing as 'the blackhole list'. There are no organised global blacklists, just a bunch of disconnected rbl's uribl's and hashix dns bl's.
I thing you need a better spamfilter (provider).
Of course not. The majority of spam is sent through hacked php-accounts, bots,etc.
In other words: some poor smuck who is clueless about computers would pay the bill (think: elderly people, dumb people, etc).
Would a criminal hesitate about buying a couple of thousand hacked smtp-
accounts to spam milions of people, and let other people pick up the tap / Since this is allready the way most spammers work, I don't see why they would
not continue to operate that way.
No they don't! The moment a couple of systems on the internet do these kind of things spammers don't bother about how them. But the moment a substancial
number of systems use it spammers simply adjust. And besides that: lot's of spam (most) is send through legitimate systems, that
do things by the book (so greylisting, etc doesn't work against those systems).
So paying/e-stamping is useless, blacklisting is the solution? Blacklisting hasn't worked so far, but don't let that stop you.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Does RISC V solve Spectre ? 
Since Spectre and Meltdown are exploiting unintended consequences of techniques (branch prediction, L1 & L2 cache in cpu, etc) that where
developed (and even necessary ) for RISC familiy CPU's this seems like
a really weird claim (google RISC vs. CISC ). It's possible to have CPU's using a RISC instuction set that are not vulnerrable, but those CPU's would run on a really slow clock speed
(so that memmory speed is not a bottleneck anymore) and would use massive amounts of cores so that the total speed woud still be ok.
In short:
Instead of having a CPU with 4 cores at 2.0 Ghz each, a system like that would have a CPU with 32 cores clocked at 500 Mhz.

They do. The techniques in question that are being exploited are specificly there

Yes, a implementation that has no OOE and mem caches could run on a high frequency
but this would be totally useless (it would use more power, and would be waiting all
the time).

I have notticed that although people always recommend ipsec as
the 'correct' vpn protocol, they in practise run openvpn or anything else. And this is despite the near universal adoption of ipsec in OS'es.
For anybody wondering why this is the case, I would recommend to this
person that they try to setup a really simple VPN connection between
say .. a Mac, and a linux system on the net. The first thing you will discover is that if the product and the settings at both sides are not *exactly* the same, then you're in for a afternoon of debugging
with tcpdump/wireshark. And even if they are the same, you will probably
encounter al kinds of issues with firewall's etc.. Most people won't go so far and, simply give up after an hour to switch
to wireguard or a TLS based vpn (the only reason I got ipsec up and running between swan and pfsense is with root + shell access on both sides, and lot's and lot's of patience).
ipsec seems to be created for the ideal network administrator living in a ideal world managing a ideal network.
If we want universal encryption, then we need praktical systems that work, even if they are not perfect. So yes, give me tcpcrypt (opportunistic encryption / rfc7435 and draft-ietf-tcpinc-tcpcrypt-12) all the time, and wireguard as VPN. OE through ipsec (Opportunistic Encryption using The Internet Key Exchange (IKE))  sounds like a nice idea, but I don't believe anything ipsec related will ever deliver practical universal encryption (I've been waiting for more then 20 years, and have moved on).

@_subject: [Cryptography] Came up with a weird use case, got questions 
I was wondering about something like this myself (I called it a digitale
time-capsule, like the one's you put in the ground). For me it was a way to
make sure that information can survive any censuring regime, by encypting
now and decrypting in a (faraway) future. The idea was to setup a destributed
network with encrypted content (bittorrent with encrypted files by archiving
organisations around the world that mirror each others content automaticly).
The one thing I came up with was using a short key, so that - if Moore's law still applys in the future - the key could be bruteforced in the future.
(And useing RSA, so that advances in crypto (quantum computing / factoring) could be used to decrypt a private key given a pub-key). So 2 possible mechanism's are : * difficulty (brute force of problem becomes possible in the future)
* class of problem (the whole problem class will be solved in the future)
(And of course these 2 could be both used, so that if one assumption proves
to be wrong, the other might still be right)
Any other mechanism's/idea's are very welcome, and could help a lot.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Came up with a weird use case, got questions 
It doesn't make sense. Why bother with a HSM if the total system will
depend on a distributed trusted third party? (to sign time / whatever).
In this case, simply cut out a unnecessary 'thing', and remove the HSM from the system altogether. So its either :
a HSM with a buildin clock that will release it's contents in time OR a (hidden) notary cabal where each member will hold part of the key (think DNSSEC root signing) and that will release this key at a given time in the future.
But of course a HSM can be confiscated, satelites can be shot down, and members of a notary can be prosecuted / hunted down. That is why i was wondering if a system could exist where the encypted data can be in plain sight, and *everybody* will be able to generate the key in the future. If a malicieus regime allready knowns where to look for the key, then the
key will be vulnerable, and if the location of the key is secret, then the mechanism to keep the key hidden might as well *be* the key.
Who say's that some existing religions where not allready started for exactly this purpose? :)
