At toorcon this year there will be a talk on quantum cryptography along  with a demonstration of some experimental quantum crypto hardware on  loan from a company in switzerland. Also, there's going to be a really  good keynote talk by Bruce Schneier of Counterpane and quite a few  others that look pretty promising (Robert X. Cringely, Cory Doctorow,  Seth Hardy, etc..).
