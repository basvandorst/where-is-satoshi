@_subject: DOS attack on WPA 802.11? 
There is another reason why it won't change. The majority of the IEEE are not interested in denial of service attacks. This issue has been brought up several times at TGi and other meetings by myself, Bernard Aboba and a few others. The standard response is that this is RF and you can always do a DoS.  But, they're missing the point of the cost of the attacker to run the attack.
Unfortunately right now, anyone with a NIC card and laptop can deny service to multiple AP's on a WLAN using tools available on the Internet. This is true for the current and ALL future standards, and each case they don't have to resort to sending malformed frames to TKIP. It is just a simple, unprotected by a MIC/MAC, disassociate

@_subject: The TCPA; =?windows-1252?Q?What=92s_wrong=3B_What=92s_righ?= 
We are all aware of the criticisms that the TCPA has received. Ross Anderson did a good job of explaining the problems in an abstract fashion, but I felt that there were some things left out (Privacy concerns). I also wanted to see if the TCPA could provide the good things- mandatory access control, integrity protection, and secure storage without the bad things. What I found will appear in an article in my security column of IEEE Computer next month. However, I wanted to briefly mention the findings before hand.

It uses:
provides for per 	packet keys and eliminates the Fluhrer et. al. attack. Russ Housely, Doug Whitting, and Nils Ferguson designed TKIP.
security. The reason they chose that is because older AP hardware can't do much more.  Nils Ferguson designed Michael. Michael MUST be used with detection methods to prevent integrity attacks. Hopefully, the vendors will do it correctly.
I'll try and dig up the documents that define each of this and post them somewhere.

TGi has NEVER been all that interested in DOS attacks because a number of people argued that all you need to do is turn on a spark gap transmitter. While this is true, I think it is harder (one can argue how much) to get a spark gap transmitter and use it correctly than a laptop, NIC card, and parabolic dish. As a result, the threat class becomes much larger than it should be. And BTW, you can do all sorts of DOS attacks against the base .11 protocol (sending management, EAP, etc. frames willy nilly; see  as an example).
I think the bigger concern with the Michael countermeasures is:
Ideally, the compliance checking will ensure this.......but then TGi had do a delicate balancing act between finding a solution that can be implemented in firmware, and actually makes some improvements. I think they did a reasonable job with WPA1 considering the engineering

There is no control of your system with remote attestation. Remote attestation simply allows the distant end of a communication to determine if your configuration is acceptable for them to communicate with you. As such, remote attestation allows communicating parties to determine with whom they communicate or share services. In that respect, it is just like caller id. People should be able to either attest remotely, or block it just like caller id. Just as the distant end can choose to accept or not accept the connection.

I agree with everything you say, David, until here.
If that is the case, then strong authentication provides the same degree of control over your computer. With remote attestation, the distant end determines if they wish to communicate with you based on the fingerprint of your configuration. With strong authentication, the distant end determines if they wish to communicate with you based on your identity.
I just don't see remote attestation as providing control over your computer provided the user/owner has control over when and if remote attestation is used. Further, I can think of several instances where remote attestation is a good thing. For example, a privacy P2P file sharing network. You wouldn't want to share your files with an RIAA modified version of the program that's designed to break the anonymity of the network.

That is the difference, but my point is that the result with respect to the control of your computer is the same. The distant end either communicates with you or it doesn't. In authentication, the distant end uses your identity to make that decision. In remote attestation, the distant end uses your computer's configuration (the computer's identity to some degree) to make that same decision.
My statement was that the two are similar to the degree to which the distant end has control over your computer. The difference is that in remote attestation we are authenticating a system and we have some assurance that the system won't deviate from its programming/policy (of course all of the code used in these applications will be formally verified :-)). In user authentication, we're authenticating a human and we have significantly less assurance that the authenticated subject in this case (the human) will follow policy. That is why remote attestation and authentication produce different side effects enabling different applications: the underlying nature of the authenticated subject. Not because of a difference in the technology.
Well- biometrics raises some interesting Gattica issues.  But, I'm not going to go there on the list. It is a discussion that is better done over a few pints.
So to summarize- I was focusing only on the control issue and noting that even though the two technologies enable different applications (due to the assurance that we have in how the authenticated subject will behave), they are very similar in nature.

@_subject: How broad is the SPEKE patent. 
You may want to look at EAP-PAX. We tried to engineer around the  patent land mines in the field when we designed it. This of course  doesn't mean that someone won't claim it infringes on something.
We also have a proof (not yet published) of security in a random  oracle model.
Best, Bill
p.s. EAP-PAX is work with my student T. Charles Clancy.

Yes- the IronKey like just about EVERY security product right now  lacks a trusted path. However, they address this by suggesting that you:
password manager, and
This mitigates the lack of a trusted path between the user and the  USB device.
Granted the average user can't discern a "clean" machine from a "non- clean" machine. But, I think they've addressed your issue as best  they can.
The marketing is a bit over the top, but hardly snake oil.
p.s. I have no relationship with Ironkey.

Yes - he's also likely the target of every Intel service in the world now (if he wasn't already).
Out of curiosity has the GPG or associated UI's ever been audited?
