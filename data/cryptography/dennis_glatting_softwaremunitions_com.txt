With key escrow they are free to log anyway, yes? If so, then all key
escrow adds is more information to collect.
"Legal means," I'll argue, is a joke term. In the opinion and experience
of many, in the United States the ability to protect oneself against
inappropriate legal means is a direct function of one's financial
resources. For example, legal means can be interpreted as using the court
system to harass others, such as some companies are presently doing to
squash descent. The RIAA, MPAA, and others verses Felten, 2600, and others
is another.

This is going to sound strange, but does your printer call the FBI?
I was looking through my firewall logs and found this gem:
206.129.5.146 is my HP printer. 12.1.224.109 is:
Looking through the config I don't see anything for 12.1.224.109.

I checked my logs. There was a hit to a different, unused IP address on my
network a few days ago.
I wonder of the extent of this activity. Anyone check their logs?
