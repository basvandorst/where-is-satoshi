"Palladium promises to eliminate buffer overflows"
Oh, yea, right, because the code is signed, magic pixie
dust, poof, there are no buffer overflows. -MFR

More detailed descriptions of these Office Of The Secretary Of Defense (OSD), Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
solicitations are further down the page.  Directly clicking on the links yields some login prompt.
OSD03-001 Differential Analysis Software Protection
OSD03-002 Idiosyncratic Computer Signatures used for Software Protection
OSD03-003 Reconfigurable Processors for Software Protection
OSD03-004 Protecting Software Binaries from Reverse Engineering
OSD03-005 Tools to Aid in Protection of Application Software During
While skeptical of the ordinary utility of these projects, I
apolitically note that all of them could be moot under a TCPA, which they don't explicitly mention.
Apart from this, these topics are familiar. However, one thing
new to me was "Reconfigurable Processors for Software Protection". There, one has "To operate properly, the attacker must utilize the instruction set of the processor that the software and operating system was designed to operate on".  I don't see why finding an instruction set mapping is hard.      Michael

@_subject: Russia Intercepts US Military Communications? 
Via the Cryptome,  "RU sure", look
at I'm amazed at their claims of radio interception. One would expect that all US military communications, even trivial ones, are strongly encrypted, given the ease of doing this. Someone, more well informed, please reassure me that this is the case.
Otherwise, yet another thing is very wrong about this war and
the infrastructure that supports it. -MFR

Nosing around on the same site, one finds "How military radio communications are intercepted"
Searching for SINCGARS indicates that all US military radios have
encryption capabilities, which can be turned off.  Several, in use,
key distribution systems are mentioned.  Perhaps these systems or even
encryption, with infrequently changed keys are, as you suggest, too
inconvenient to use under the conditions.  -MFR
