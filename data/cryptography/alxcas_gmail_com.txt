@_subject: [Cryptography] Random generator and loophole in Bell's inequalities 
An eventual logic hole in Bell's inequalities can prevent a secure
information transfer via quantum cryptography.
That is:
Include probabilities of the kind (sin θ)^2 in Bell-Wigner's inequality,
and we will have a violation in the inequality,
Include probabilities of the kind (sin θ)^2 in Bell-Wigner's inequality and
we will not have a violation in the inequality.
