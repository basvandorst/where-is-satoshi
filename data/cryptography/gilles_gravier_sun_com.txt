@_subject: NSA tapping undersea fibers? 
If you slightly bend fiber, a portion of the signal goes through the
wall... kind of like a semi-transparent mirror... part of the signal is
still reflected inside the fiber... but part of it goes out... to the
tapping instrument.

@_subject: FBI-virus software cracks encryption wall 
Jetico (  ) has a hard disk encryption software
called BestCrypt, which can actually intercept the keystrokes at BIOS
level, get the correct keys and re-maps them to random for upper layers...
like keystroke loggers.
I'd be interested to see how the FBI horror fares with something like
By the way... BestCrypt also encrypts on the fly with a random key
the windows SWAP file... so after system crash, nothing useful can
be recovered from SWAP leftovers... Next thing is to encrypt
$TEMP :)
Oh... FBI thing... so do they expect to have a version working for
Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris (had to name that one), Mac, Palm,
BeOS (OK... they're dead)... and who knows what else?
If they only cover Windoze (which is likely) the result will be that
the criminal / paranoid / privacy freak / hacker community will just
plain migrate to another OS... Which would be good for the world,
don't you think?

What about:
At least one antivirus software company, McAfee Corp., contacted the FBI
on Wednesday to ensure its software wouldn't inadvertently detect the
bureau's snooping software and alert a criminal suspect.
I know we were all tought not to believe the press but still...

@_subject: DeCSS, crypto, (regions removed??!) 
In any case, some countries in Europe (this is the case for France and Switzerland, for example) are starting to make it illegal to sell disks that are not REGION-2 in the stores... so in effect, you can buy all the region free players in the world, if you have no access to the internet to buy your DVDs, you can't buy or rent REGION-1 DVDs anymore.
In effect, this is limiting access to local culture to only people who have internet or travel to the USA. For example, take the movie "36 Fillette"... a French movie (French version of Lolita, of sorts)... well, this French movie exists only on a REGION-1 DVD. Unless you can access the internet to order it, it is not possible to view it in France or Switzerland.
