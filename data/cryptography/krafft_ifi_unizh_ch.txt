@_subject: Attacks on AES 
I have to present a talk on recent (theoretical) attacks on Serpent
and Rijndall (among other AES ciphers). Could you direct me to some
technical high-quality references?
Also, I have heard that RSA is suffering from similar attacks, but
I couldn't find any literature yet. Can you confirm this, and if so,
possibly show me some references on that too?

@_subject: RSA Attacks? (was: Attacks on AES) 
First off, thanks to everyone who replied to my AES attacks thread so
far! Keep 'em coming... ;^>
Second, to add to my original post:
This possibly refers back to Bernstein's _Circuits for Integer
Factorisation_ from a year ago. I am still talking to the guys who
want this talk to make sure that they want me to indeed cover a 12
Month old story, but so far, I could find *nothing* pertaining to RSA
since DJBs paper.

@_subject: An exercise on cryptography 
I am not sure if this is going to be on-topic here, but it's
a crypto list, and what I am doing is crypto.
I am teaching an intro class on internet security here at the Uni
Zurich. I would like my students (130 of them) to learn how to use
GnuPG or PGP, thereby advocating a little ;^>.
I am going to require them to generate a key, have it signed by at
least another member of the class, upload it to a keyserver, then
sign an email to me containing some answers to basic crypto
questions. They have a month to complete this, so it's more than
The only problem I have is how to prevent them from calling or
emailing each other to sign their keys quickly. Is there some way
you could conceive that I could require them to perform standard
keysigning protocol? I'll have them drink a beer with one another,
that's 50% of the selling argument, but it won't persuade all of
What do you think? I am grateful for any input, off-list preferably.
I shall report back to the list with the synthesis (Reply-To set).
