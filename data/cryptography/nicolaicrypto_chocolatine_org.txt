For signatures, a few projects (including OpenBSD) are using signify,
which uses the Ed25519 signature system.  It's really nice!
I'm not aware of any encryption software with similar usage/deployment,
although I've heard of reop, CPGB, sgp-c and others.  SC4 was also
mentioned in this thread.  All the interesting ones are based on NaCl.
