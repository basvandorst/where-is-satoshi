@_subject: [Cryptography] Possible reason why password usage rules are 
That password expiration tenet remains stubbornly and execrably contemporary. I think it must presume inevitable password compromise, or uncompromising hostility toward users of passwords.
I tried to find a credible cult genesis and did not have much luck, perhaps because it antedates the Internet Rapture. There was an unnamed circa 1980s reference mentioned in an article?. Peculiarly, the cited (likely version 1.0) NIST SP 800-63? in the article does not mention password expiry. A later NIST draft SP 800-118? had thirty-three text references to password expiration beginning with one which allows that expiry is common, beneficial, ineffectual, and despised. NIST did not recommend against password (memorized secret authenticator) expiry until SP 800-63 revision 3?.
