done.  It fails to restate the obvious that a court can make this demand
again (rinse lather repeat).
I'm reminded right now of a line from Kipling's poem "Dane-Geld" [0]
And that is called paying the Dane-geld;
  But we've  proved it again and again,
That if once you have paid him the Dane-geld
  You never get rid of the Dane.
in the "dark".
I've had this thought many times myself. How can we make the crypto
stronger? How can we make it unbreakable? I think in the end it's
foolishness for us to believe the key to privacy / overreach is better
crypto. It's only a matter of carrots or sticks until something in the line
is subverted.
One bright side is that crypto increases the "cost" of monitoring citizens.
For example, police have always had the ability (with a warrant) to tap a
land line, yet they didn't tap and monitor all lines back before cell
phones were around. It was expensive, and impractical. And besides, what
judge would issue that kind of warrant? Madness.
For some reason if we replace "land line" with "internet connection" it
seems a lot more judges are willing to issue warrants. At least in
secret... for all we know. What do we know anyway?
By the way, I did a "ctrl + f" for "secret court" and "gag order" in the US
constitution. No hits.

bullets whizzing around your head.
I can't help but feel this will easily backfire. If we all lament the loss
of liberty for security, it seems fear is incongruous with a free society.
When people are scared they begin making trade-offs.
I've spoken to a few people about this. The general response I hear is "I
don't have anything to hide so why block the government?" I find most
people are generally in favor of giving the government a backdoor into
their phone. Or rather, they aren't scared of it.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Response to "I don't have anything to hide" 
I'm sure many of us who have tried to explain the backdoor problem to their
friends and family have heard this response to the question
Part of building support for Apple and fighting the backdoor is a grass
roots effort to educate our friends of the real risk here (as we see them).
I figure I would toss this question out and seek advice from the general
community. How do you respond to "I don't have anything to hide"? How do
you explain to non-technical (and non-paranoid) friends of what's really at
