@_subject: crypto question 
I've reverse engineered passwords out of several apps. Often the PWs
were visible as plain text when the app was examined with a hex editor.
Once I had to "execute" the app on paper to find where the password was
fetched from, no decent debugger being available. (And what a
time-consuming pain that was, but necessary to recover client data.)
I can't think of any secure way to do what you want, "secure" being
defined as "as secure as not doing that", unless you have secure
hardware the way MPAA, RIAA, and Sen Hollings (D-Disney) want. By
spreading the key among modules you could probably raise the
reverse-engineering cost, in effort and time, to the point where no one
would bother to do it. Just don't trust any really important data to

Bah. They were probably Word documents with the "password required"
option turned on.

@_subject: Question on the state of the security industry 
============================== START ==============================
Nothing here. Spam is the main concern on people's minds, so far as I
can tell. Please note, though, that I'm not specifically a computer
security consultant but rather a broad-spectrum computer consultant who
does some security work and a private security guy who does some
computer work.
Topical anecdote: my last full-time but short-term consulting* gig was
at a bank. You know, money and stuff. Computer security in the
development shop consisted of telling the programmers to run NAV daily.
They used Outlook for email, with no filters on incoming mail that I
could track down. I did some minor testing from my home system. Didn't
send myself any viruses, but I did send a few executable attachments.
They all made it through.
* Not really consulting. They wanted a warm-body programmer, and not
only ignored the process improvement suggestions I was putatively hired
to provide, but seemed offended that I had suggestions to make at all.

But it's cool!
More seriously, it has no advantage now, but maybe something will come
up. The early telephones were about useless, too, remember. In the mean
time, the coolness factor will keep people playing with it and
researching it.
