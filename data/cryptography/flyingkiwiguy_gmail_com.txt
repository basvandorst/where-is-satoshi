@_subject: [Cryptography] Linux /dev/random and /dev/urandom 
Can someone in the crypto-community with the necessary technical knowledge
and contacts please review the above paper and then find someone (perhaps
the authors?) to provide the necessary patches to the Linux kernel to get
this fixed?
This seems to be an excellent opportunity to utilise the supposed merits of
open source development and review. If enough *justified* noise is made in
the Linux dev community I would hope this would rapidly bubble up to become
a required security patch for all the major Linux distros.
For context here is a recent discussion about entropy generation and a list
of Linux developers that might be interested in sponsoring a peer-reviewed
Linux kernel patch:
Recent discussion on LKML re: [PATCH] /dev/random: Insufficient of entropy
on many architectures:
Note the concern about efficiency as priority over security. /dev/random is
I believe used by OpenSSL -

 > I agree. The IETF is the most open standards organization I know.
In a recent TED presentation both Tim Berners-Lee and Snowden are calling
for an "Internet Magna Carta":
Would the RFC process be the ideal forum for development of an Internet
Magna Carta?

@_subject: [Cryptography] LibreSSL rewrite of OpenSSL status and funding 
As most probably know the OpenBSD guys are developing a fork of OpenSSL
1.0.1g called LibreSSL:
   - OpenSSL 1.0.1g was a 388,00 line code base.
   - About 90,000 lines of C source code deleted, about 150,000 lines of
   files.
   - Approximately at 500,000 line unifigg from 1.0.1g at this point.
   - Many bugs fixed
   - The cleaning continues, but we have now started adding new features
   (ciphers)
   - The code has become more readable - portions still remain scary.
Notably for this forum:
OpenSSL's attempt to be a random subsystem resulted in all sorts of horrors:
   - EGD considered harmful - really, userland has no business in this.
   - Library can decide "Oh Noes, We need something random..." and then:
   - Your RSA Private key is pretty random
char seed[] = "String to Give the Random Number Generator Randomness";
   - Since many of these were always "there" - these become an attack
   target - modify the word to enable them and you have predictable key
   generation
They are naturally focusing on OpenBSD compatibility, which will
necessarily delay any ports back to Linux and other OSes:
We are looking for funding commitment to:
   - Sponsor several developers to re-write some key pieces of the codebase
   - Sponsor some efforts of the portability/ports people to track the
   effects of changes through the ports tree and push changes upstream.
   - In a nutshell, a significant funding commitment for a couple of years.
   We would like to speed the rewrite of this library but not at the expense
   of our usual resources to maintain OpenBSD, OpenSSH and related projects.
   - Yes we have asked the Linux Foundation. They have not yet committed to
   support us.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Reproducible results 
I am interested in whether that is actually being carried out as a standard
I think the following says it all, albeit from a domain usually far removed
from the rigour of mathematical proof:
Its unglamorous, poorly funded, and tedious work disproving other
researchers' results. There is also selective bias in journals reporting
novel results versus negative results:
Returning to cryptography, and as a non-cryptographer - how do I verify
that the cryptographic tools I use are "generally regarded" or "provably
demonstrated" as secure? Do I simply rely on the authority of Bruce?

@_subject: [Cryptography] stego mechanism used in real life (presumably), 
So what methods are effective for defeating physical print tracking?
Scanning or copying the print out likely will reproduce the yellow dots,
unless the scan is grey-scaled. Obviously, running the printed documents
through OCR would remove yellow dot tracking.
Textual steganography is a bit worrisome, but I guess you could run it
through Google translate twice to obfuscate. Not ideal.
