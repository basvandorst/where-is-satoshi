I have to say I agree in a way.  It has always been my contention that by
opposing key escrow, we open the door to more key logging.  And that's
good, so long as 1) it's not a built in remote-activation 'feature' of
software or hardware and 2) there's a warrant requirement.  This gets the
balance as right as we're going to get it - cops won't fish more than they
already do, the act leaves a serious paper trail, and judges are as
involved as they want to be.
The argument that we should have no key escrow and also no means by which
data is ever recoverable by legal means is unwinnable politically, and not
necessarily right morally either.  The issue is whether there will be
appropriate process and safeguards.

To be clear, I am *NOT* arguing for key escrow.  Just saying that since
I'm against it, I accept that there may be scope for judicious,
paper-trail oriented, key logging.

It's often cheaper not to handle cash because you can use employees in a
lower pay grade and/or ones who are not bonded.  Cash is easier to steal,
the incentive to palm it rather than ring it up is higher. and there are
often extensive bureaucratic rules about handling it throughout the food
