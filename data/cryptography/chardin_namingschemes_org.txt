@_subject: Did American slaves use steganography? 
"Two historians say African American slaves may have used a quilt code
 to navigate the Underground Railroad. Quilts with patterns named
 'wagon wheel,' 'tumbling blocks,' and 'bear's paw' appear to have
 contained secret messages that helped direct slaves to freedom, the
 pair claim."
