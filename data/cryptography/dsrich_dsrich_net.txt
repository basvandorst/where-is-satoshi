An "easy" way to swamp out almost all of the usage signal available to the meter would be to put a one or two horsepower motor between each phase and ground (assuming standard 240V 2 phase house wiring) and use an Arduino or Raspberry PI to randomly vary the load on the motor, using a cryptographically strong random number generator to vary both the load, and the interval between load changes.
Besides the initial cost of the equipment, there is the cost of constantly using (roughly) 2 kw of electricity just running this device, which could be enough electricity to have other snoopy sorts (narcs) raiding your house on suspicion of growing pot in the basement, but it would keep the smart meter befuddled.

============================== START ==============================
A little thumbnail electrical engineering work on the supercap idea:
Hmmmm....  Does anyone make a supercap rated for 400V at 100A? Nominal calculated fully rectified 240VAC is about 340VDC IIRC, so that will be your supercap working voltage. Calculating for 240V/100A full load output with unity power factor, the "float" current flow - rectifier to inverter - is about 70.6A but there is always power factor loss with motors (heat pumps and dryer) and the inverter that converts it back to AC has quite a few losses too.
Another problem is finding a 240V inverter to attach to your capacitor to convert the DC back to 240 AC at 100A. Finally, put a 30 KVA 240V:240V w/CT isolation transformer ahead of your fuse box to make everything work like you are used to.
What this basically amounts to is an always-on UPS, and a very expensive one at that.
