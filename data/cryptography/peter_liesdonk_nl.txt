@_subject: Circle Bank plays with two-factor authentication 
Here in the Netherlands, we have a bank (Rabobank) which sends the
required code by SMS to your (registered) cellular phone as soon as
you want to log in. So the codes are always fresh and random and only
available to whoever knows the password ?nd has the phone.
At my own bank, the bank-card is also a smartcard. When trying to log
in, the bank issues a random six-digit challenge. With the use of a
seperate cardreader, the bank-/smartcard can compute an (8-digit)
response to the challenge. This response is computed with a private
key stored in the card. The card can only be used after entering the
correct PIN. Three wrong PINs block the smartcard.
These two systems also obviously have their pro's and cons, but they
both seem much more secure than the other schemes i have seen here.
