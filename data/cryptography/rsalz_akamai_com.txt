No.  One mission of the NSA is to protect US government secrets. Since the government can no longer afford to specify their own security products all the time (or rather that the computer market has become commoditized), the NSA has an interest in making standard COTS products be secure.

How would this work, in practice?  How would knowing a CA's private key give them knowledge of my key?  Or if they issued a fake certificate and keypair, how does that help?  They'd also have to suborn DNS and IP traffic such that it would, perhaps eventually or perhaps quickly, become obvious.

@_subject: [Cryptography] [cryptography] STARTTLS for HTTP 
Well, maybe.  The "rules" say that you don't treat HTTP over TLS as if it were HTTPS.  It's unauthenticated. And the end-user isn't really supposed to be led into thinking that the user-agent is making things secure.  The rules for handling cookies, for example, don't let them become "secure cookies" just because they were fetched over an encrypted link.
It's a hard concept to wrap your head around unless you're a hardcore HTTP geek.  You have to think about what the HTTP/2 spec says, carefully. It's an implementor's document, not an end-user document.
So what will happen?  Hard to say.  Firefox has said they're going to use HTTP over TLS because they want as much encryption as possible. Chrome has said they will not do it because they want as much authenticated encryption as possible. IE has said no, but seems to be thinking about yes. I haven't heard what Opera's said, if anything. And Safari is, as usual for Apple, keeping things to themselves.
It's definitely in a state of flux. And trying to guess what the browsers will do is very much the n-body problem, because they all affect each other as they call compete for market share.

I don't think so.  Type "browser market share" into your favorite search engine.  None of those lines appear horizontal.  Unless you're arguing that the variance doesn't matter?  That's more open to interpretation I guess, but I'd still say you're wrong.  And what also matters, greatly, is that the browser makes thing is important, what they think the "competition" is doing, and what they think their users want.

Install the SCSV fallback. Modern clients (say those written shortly after the start of this century) will do TLS, older ones can use SSL, and you can avoid having the modern ones tricked into acting like older ones.  The server-side code is pretty easy to do, and is bundled into OpenSSL since the time of disclosure.
Note that this will catch many false-positives because of network hiccups and browsers not always being able to tell when it's the network and when it's the server denying them.

In a previous job, I said that once FIPS becomes a requirement, we just give all those customers a free certified HSM as it would be cheaper and more maintainable than trying to get ourselves certified.

Not false, that was a design goal.  Make HTTP, which is a TCP protocol, "secure" (for some definition of secure which isn't relevant right now, actually).
SSL was invented to enable electronic commerce, and the concern was that people would have to feel comfortable that they were sending their credit card information to Sears, not Sores. So server-side authentication, in the form of trusted third parties, was felt to be the best way forward. So RSA with certificates was the answer, and IIRC RSA got a piece of Netscape equity in exchange for a license.

I think many people are missing the point.
By default, SMTP traffic is unauthenticated cleartext. You have no idea who is at the other end and anyone can sniff the packets along the way. With STARTTLS, traffic is unauthenticated ciphertext. You have no idea who is at the other end, but only the endpoint (or those who compromised it) can see the content. Many people consider that progress, even though it is still unauthenticated.

Please find this statement issued by the IAB today.

IAB Statement on Internet Confidentiality
In 1996, the IAB and IESG recognized that the growth of the Internet depended on users having confidence that the network would protect their private information.  RFC 1984 documented this need.  Since that time, we have seen evidence that the capabilities and activities of attackers are greater and more pervasive than previously known.  The IAB now believes it is important for protocol designers, developers, and operators to make encryption the norm for Internet traffic.  Encryption should be authenticated where possible, but even protocols providing confidentiality without authentication are useful in the face of pervasive surveillance as described in RFC 7258.
Newly designed protocols should prefer encryption to cleartext operation.
There may be exceptions to this default, but it is important to recognize that protocols do not operate in isolation.  Information leaked by one protocol can be made part of a more substantial body of information by cross-correlation of traffic observation.  There are protocols which may as a result require encryption on the Internet even when it would not be a requirement for that protocol operating in isolation.
We recommend that encryption be deployed throughout the protocol stack since there is not a single place within the stack where all kinds of communication can be protected.
The IAB urges protocol designers to design for confidential operation by default.  We strongly encourage developers to include encryption in their implementations, and to make them encrypted by default.  We similarly encourage network and service operators to deploy encryption where it is not yet deployed, and we urge firewall policy administrators to permit encrypted traffic.
We believe that each of these changes will help restore the trust users must have in the Internet.  We acknowledge that this will take time and trouble, though we believe recent successes in content delivery networks, messaging, and Internet application deployments demonstrate the feasibility of this migration.  We also acknowledge that many network operations activities today, from traffic management and intrusion detection to spam prevention and policy enforcement, assume access to cleartext payload.  For many of these activities there are no solutions yet, but the IAB will work with those affected to foster development of new approaches for these activities which allow us to move to an Internet where traffic is confidential by default.

Yes, it means that ISRG will not commit to making every single bit of source available. For example, the system might use a RAID disk whose controller is private source. Or it might use a tamper-proof HSM where the vendor does not give out the source.  And for most of the people in the world, that will be okay.  But one or two with loud voices will complain "you promised to give all the source."
So ISRG is setting realistic and achievable goals.

Another interesting aspect of CT is that it significantly raises the cost of a CA to agree to an NSL. Imagine someone like Verisign is compelled to issue a bogus certificate, and that it is found out. Verisign is now stuck: either run the risk of violating the NSL and admitting what happened, or run the risk of having their CA removed from the browser's trust store, rendering ALL Verisign sites untrusted. In essence, the cost for compliance could be going out of business, which could be a pretty strong argument to make if appealing the order.  If CT does nothing else but make secret orders much**2 more difficult that seems a good thing.

I know you hate cryptographic agility.  So, riddle me this.
Make a timeline for the past 15 years.  Which ONE cipher suite should SSL/TLS have used?
And then, once that timeline is defined, can you describe, loosely, the protocol changes needed to deploy.  But more importantly, if "pick a cipher" isn't part of the initial connection, does it become "pick a version"?  Or does the client connect 'n' times, with the associated TCP overhead?

Based on the replies I am seeing, I realize that my question was not clear.  Let me try again.
Make a timeline for the past 15 years.  Which one cipher, *for each year* should SSL/TLS have used?  Won?t it change at least once?  Move it forward to project the cipher in use for the next 3-5 years because that?s what TLS WG is working on right now.
Once you have the list of ciphers, loosely describe the protocol changes needed to deploy.  If ?pick a cipher? isn?t part of the initial handshake, does it become ?pick a version??  Or does the clinet connect ?n? times, with the associated TCP overhead?
If FREAK shows 512K RSA can be factored in under half a day, then perhaps 1K RSA, which some have picked for the base year, can probably be factored in a week or two.  So clearly, there has to be at least one change in your timelines.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Real-world crypto/PRNG problem:  Bridge 
Forwarding for a colleague.
I have a (semi) practical question for the cryptographers in the house.
The American Contract Bridge League is following some god-awful practices in (electronically) generating the hands that are being used for major tournaments.
1. They are not using cryptographically secure pseudo random number generators
2. They are using the same seed to generate enormous numbers of sets of hands (76,000) at a time
3. Hand records are public after the fact, so folks get to see the output of the process
The random number generator itself only generates 2^48 bits so a brute force attack seems pretty simple, however, this presumes that I have the code to turn output from the PRNG --> hands.
Assume for the moment that I didn't have this information. Rather, all that I have is a (number of) sets of ordered output from the hand generator. How difficult do folks think it would be to be able to crack the dealing program itself? (I can think of some potential implementations that would be neigh impossible. For example, if each deal were to map to a unique integer with a random assignment between integers and deals you'd probably need to know the complete mapping to figure anything out. However, the actual program was written decades back and almost certainly uses some kind of deterministic process)
Any ballpark estimates how difficult this would be to crack?
Here is a description of the PRNG (I believe that this is a "linear congruential generator" and is not considered to be cryptographically secure)
The random number generator uses the linear congruential algorithm and 48-bit integer arithmetic. This will generate 2 to the 47th power different numbers before repeating without any outside influence (140,737,488,355,328 numbers).
Outside influence occurs in the form of manually dealt hands, starting seed numbers, time of day, etc., to make the number of numbers virtually infinite, and to guarantee that the same hand will not be repeated. Ninety-six bits take part in the operation with the high 48 bits acting as the overflow.
The operation works as follows: The hand record set number is used as the starting seed. This seed is multiplied by day of the month, current minute, current hour, current second, current day of week and current hundredth of second. This number is then multiplied by a large prime number (5DEECE66D in hexadecimal). Thirteen is then added to this. The lower 48 bits is then saved and used as the seed to generate the next random number. The overflow (48 high bits) is then doubled and multiplied by the range requested (1 - 52) and the overflow from this is used as the random number.
And here is some additional snark that that ACBL's tech guy threw in for good measure
"The computer used to run the ACBL hand record generator is a stand alone desktop computer that is not connected to any network. Since Jim's retirement in May, I have been responsible for maintaining our stock of electronic hand records used by our Tournament Directors.
When we need additional hand records, we generate two thousand sets at a time (72,000 deals). The seed deal is manually entered at the beginning of the process, and is not part of any set subsequently produced. Sets are never reused, and the number of the set is not released publicly until after play. The date and time when the hand record was prepared (we keep a five thousand set buffer) does not leave ACBL Headquarters.
With so many of the variables involved in the hand record set creation process kept protected and secure, I doubt anyone will be cracking the security in sufficient time to make use of the data they develop."

Tens of thousands of individual developers and sysadmins have downloaded, built, and installed OpenSSL.  A handful of distributions also do that, and bundle it with their release. For a variety of understandable reasons, said distro's are always out of date.
And if the alarm bell is "apache won't start" they will throw out openssl or swamp us with email or perhaps fall back to plaintext.

One very exciting aspect of ACME is that work is being done to use it to enable crypto-secure identities on smartphones, this is being done in the ACME and STIR (secure telephone identity) working groups.
The infrastructure that LE built is good.  They don’t talk about details in public, but FWIW I  trust it.
One downside of LE is that they are now a single point of failure for many HTTPS websites.  Who wants to provision the next one, to help keep us more secure and private?

Forwarded with permission; Nicoli is one of the (sic) key implementors of ECC in the OpenSSL project.
    > suppose you want to create a new TLS library.  Should you support binary curves?
    I'd dare say, from an implementer perspective, the answer to this is
    "likely no".
    RFC 8422, in obsoleting RFC 4492, has de facto removed support of
    binary curves from TLS 1.2 and earlier.
    Someone might wonder if it is worth including support for binary
    curves, despite RFC 8422, for interoperability with older
    implementations, but as far as I can tell, popular SSL/TLS libraries
    never supported binary curves, or never used them by default.
    I can't point to studies showing how many of the TOP 500 sites for
    traffic generation would see handshakes using binary curves, but I
    would be surprised to see a significant number there (maybe Akamai has
    such data readily available to quantify this among their customers?). [R$: We don't]
    FIPS 186-4 does include binary curves among the recommendations and
    it's difficult for me to say what percentage of users subject to the
    FIPS requirements actually preferred binary curves over prime curves
    in the wild, in the SW realm: publicly available software
    implementations have been mostly driven by TLS usage, favoring
    optimized implementations of prime curves over work towards optimizing
    implementations of binary curves. Limited availability (and at lower
    performance levels) could easily have been a limiting factor in
    adoption of binary curves even for uses outside general TLS and the
    World Wide Web.
    In OpenSSL's libcrypto, for example, it is possible to access
    implementations of binary elliptic curves, but they are not supported
    in OpenSSL's libssl, thus not available for TLS handshakes (not even
    before RFC 8422), and in general, as they use generic implementations
    supporting various binary field sizes, the performance level is subpar
    compared to highly optimized implementations for specific prime curves
    (e.g. the nistz265 implementation for P-256 or the 128-bit
    implementations for P-224, P-256 and P-512).
    The notion that, in the domain of SW implementations, prime curves are
    faster than binary curves, has been repeatedly challenged by academia,
    and there has been work on optimizing and hardening the binary curve
    side of things in OpenSSL, but IMO for the time being, the next
    biggest performance (and security) improvement would likely come by
    including specialized `EC_METHOD` implementations for specific curves,
    instead of relying on the "generic" implementation that works with any
    arbitrary binary field parameter set: but a prerequisite for that
    would be selecting candidates that are widely used to justify the
    extra costs? kind of a chicken and egg problem.
    Some links about recent improvements to software binary EC
    implementations in OpenSSL I have been somewhat involved with:
    -     -      -     For hardware implementations, the general assumption is that binary
    elliptic curves are faster and cheaper in area, so, in that field,
    binary curves might see some wider adoption. OTOH, recent years saw a
    surge in availability of cheap microcontrollers and coprocessors
    (either external or inside the same chip package) to accelerate and
    harden elliptic curve cryptography, specifically targeting popular
    NIST prime curves and Curve25519/448, and this might probably have
    leveled the gap by now even in the HW sector.
    Note though, that admittedly my knowledge and experience in the world
    of smart cards and embedded hw implementations is very limited, so
    take my words with extra doses of grains of salt here.
    To somewhat summarize the long description, my opinion is that while
    academia has not given up on binary curves, it seems like industry
    mostly has.
    Quickly browsing through a query on DBLP
    ( shows that this is still
    a quite active area of research, but I am not aware of major efforts
    by standardization bodies that are promoting the adoption of binary
    curves at the moment.
    Actually, it seems like industry committed to evaluate an excessive
    level of flexibility in the choice space of alternative cryptographic
    algorithms as an antipattern, as we can see in the directions taken
    during the development of the TLS 1.3 spec, in the mentioned RFC 8422
    and in the current FIPS 186-5 draft, which also shows similarly that
    binary curve support is likely going to be deprecated.
    Cheers,
    Nicola Tuveri
