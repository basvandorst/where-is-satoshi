@_subject: [Cryptography] SHA-1 collision could also allow ePassport forgery 
Some countries (and not the smallest ones) still used RSA-SHA1 signatures
for their document signing certificates as late as 2010.
As passports and those certificates are usually valid 10 years this means
that if they are not revoked it is possible until 2020 to create forged
passports capable of passing automated security gates.
You can also take a look at the public key directory of the ICAO to look up
those certificates ;-)

@_subject: [Cryptography] Using the NFC chip of the Passport to do 
I came up with a funny idea on how to create an egalitarian POW mechanism
that would let everyone have the same or a very similar "hashing rate".
To keep it short, it uses the active authentication feature of the NFC chip
contained within passports.
This feature consists in having a private key contained within the chip
signing a challenge to prove that it hasn't been cloned.
So my proposal is to use this signing functionality instead of using the
typical SHA256 or Scrypt hashing algorithms.
Passports have likely a similar singing rate, and people are likely to only
have one passport.
More details can be found here if you are interested:

@_subject: [Cryptography] Efficient proof of signature knowledge for RSA and 
I currently have 2 proposals for efficiently proving the knowledge of a RSA
and an ECDSA signature posted on stackexchange but without having received
relevant answers regarding their security or possible improvements that
could be made to them.
Perhaps someone who is familiar with the topic could have a look.
