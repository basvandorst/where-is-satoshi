Yes, thats easy. We created a java library for the tpm chip. You can get
it at                      Using this lib, you need less than 10 lines of java-code for doing some
simple tpm operations.

You can do that (at least in theory).
First, you need a system with tpm. I assume you are running linux. Then
you boot your linux-kernel and an initrd using the trusted grub
bootloader. Your bios will report the checksum of trusted grub to the
tpm before giving control to your grub bootloader. Your grub bootloader
will then report the checksum of your kernel and your initrd to the tpm
before giving control to them.
After your kernel has bootet and given control to your initrd, you can
checksum your root-partition (or do something similar, like just
checking if there are setuid binarys or checksum just your shadow-file)
and report that to the tpm using a little java-application and tpm4java.
Later, you can remotely query your system and get a report what has been
bootet on your system. You can do this query using a java application
and tpm4java.
All applications like linux, grub, tpm4java are open source (you will
need a java-vm, there are some open source vms, you should be able to
use with tpm4java). The only thing which is not open source is the bios
and the exact hardware design of your tpm chip in your pc.
One thing you should know is, that a tpm can never find out, if a
software meets some specifications, like does not have an buffer
overflow or does not execute code from the network or so. You just can
check is has not been altered.

The TPM does not know that the BIOS did not lie about the checksum of
grub or any other bios component.
What you do is, you trust your TPM and your BIOS that they never lie to
you, because they are certified by the manufature of the system and the
tpm. (This is why it is called trusted computing)
So if you don't trust your hardware and your manufactor, trusted
computing is absolutely worthless for you. But if you trust a
manufactor, the manufactor trusts the tpms he has build and embedded in
some systems, and you don't trust a user that he did not boot a modified
version of your operating system, you can use these components to find
out if the user is lieing.

The problem is, just displaying anything like a hash value won't help.
You will need a second device to do a RPA. This device could be a much
smaller one, at least in theory, something like a mobile phone or an pda
would be sufficient.

I did a little survey one month ago for my bsc. thesis.
I found out, that round about 1.19% of all https-server-certs use an
exponent <= 17. I did choose round about 32,000 random webservers for
this survey.
What is intresting is what happens when it comes to imap-ssl. Here, only
0.1% of all servers use a server-cert with exponent <= 17. Imap-ssl
users seem to be the better ssl-users, tls 1.0 is more widespread there,
small rsa-modulus-sizes are more seldom, and ssl 2.0 is not so common
there too.
I will publish some more details later.

Did you try -CAfile, with this command you can give s_client a file with
CAs you trust. If the Thawte Consulting certificate is in this file, you
should have no problems with verifying.

For example, I owne an Nokia E70 smartphone running symbian. There is an
application called fring, which is basically skype for symbian which
runs on the E70. Fring offers VoIP calls over skype with your mobile
phone. The data is send over the Cellular network (UMTS or so) or
Wireless LAN, which is supported by some phones too.
I don't know how much encryption Fring does (and I don't want to
speculate how secure it is here), but it shows, that you can do VoIP on
usual high end consumers hardware.
So writing an application, which does basically the same as fring and
uses extra cryptography should be possible. I have written some java
code for the E70, and I know that it can do AES, RSA and DH in a
reasonable time, even if all computations are done in Java.
But this is all just about end-to-end encryption, you could still try to
backdoor the phones firmware, or bug the phone itself (in hardware).
Additionally, you need some kind of public key infrastructure, if you
want to call arbitrary people securely.
