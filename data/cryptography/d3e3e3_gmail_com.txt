It's always possible to make protocols more secure at higher cost. Should
802.11i have required one-time pads to be couriered to all mobile stations
involved? Probably not, since it would kind of negate some of the benefits
of Wi-Fi. For group keys, should it have added another layer of security
where, say, a public was transmitted by the AP to each station using
pairwise security and the AP signed and all stations verified every
multicast/broadcast frame? Possible, but public key cryptography is a pretty
big burden if you are, for example, streaming video to multiple stations
using multicast. Seems like it would need significant hardware support.
Anyway, if these people have found some clever way to use the fact that the
group key is a shared secret key, that might be interesting. I don't see how
it is "clever" or particularly interesting that they are able to read the
standards document and understand one of the deliberate engineering
compromises in 802.11i. (Actually, there 802 standards documents can be
somewhat arcane... Maybe you do have to be clever to be able to understand
them... :-)
If you don't like Wi-Fi security, then also use IPSec or something for all
the data you send through it.

As far as I know, a new group key is delivered serially by the AP to each
station using the pairwise security between them. Sure, you can impersonate
the MAC address of the AP and, since it's all in the Ether, you can
eavesdrop on the exchange between a station and the AP to generate a new
pairwise key or to deliver a new group key to the station and inject
messages into those conversations. But if you can break the security by such
eavesdropping or injection, that would be a big deal, and have nothing to do
with the fact that a shared key is used for group security.

Just XORing does not do as good a job of preserving the entropy in the
two inputs as a good hash function. For example, assume both are
strong in the same subfield. You could throw away half of the
potentially available entropy with XOR. But XOR has the virtue of
simplicity and so lower probability of implementation error. It is a
trade off. And, of course, if one of the inputs has zero entropy, then
XOR is fine.

The above sentence correctly summarizes the deficient article on SMS4.
Both it and the article are misleading.
SMS4 was one small piece of WAPI which was part of an effort by the
Chinese government to fork the IEEE 802.11 standard. The result would
have been two diverging and incompatible international standards: IEEE
802.11 and a Chinese government standard. IEEE 802.11 sent numerous
invitations to China to participate in the 802.11 standards process
and, in my opinion, would have jumped at the chance to incorporate
SMS4 (after it was declassified and no longer considered a Chinese
state secret) in 802.11 if there had been any positive response from
China. What ISO voted to reject was not SMS4 but the Chinese package
of a complete incompatible alternative to IEEE 802.11.
Note that I am referring to the Chinese government above, not large
Chinese companies. Several large Chinese companies are vary active
participants in IEEE 802.11 and other IEEE standards groups.

Large customers, government or otherwise, that know what they are

On the other hand, if you can get what you want included in the base

in future versions at no cost. So it makes a lot of sense to pay for
what you want to be included in the base product, unless you don't

That's a load of crap.
I've got nothing against adding encryption to DNS. Requirements and
protocols evolve. It is probably a good idea given the current state
of the Internet. But from the very first draft
DNSSEC made the kinds of services it was going to provide explicit and
these never included encryption:
 - Data Origin Authentication
 - DNS Transaction Authentication
 - Key Distribution
(DNSSEC evolved quite a bit from that -00 draft even before the first RFC 2065.)
At the time, it was just taken as a given that all information in the
DNS was public. There was no demand for encryption. That "People were
expecting some form of encryption" is demonstrably false.
Peter Gutmann may hate DNSSEC but he does say:
"although in all fairness its origins can be traced all the way back
to a mid-1980s US Department of Defence mandate to secure DNS data on
the ARPA internet followed by some work done by a defence contractor
in the early 1990s in response to a DNS security scare in 1990, when
the Internet environment was very different from what it is today"

A MITM makes use of the intended destination of the communications to

A phisher can ask for bank credentials, can probably make some general
format checks, and can try use them later. But that is not a MITM.
A MITM forwards the credentials in real time to the bank and sends the
responses, possibly modified, back. Thus a MITM knows when it has
grabbed correct credentials it is passing through.
A MITM works in the face of a fumble fingered user who commonly
mistypes their credentials. A phish fails.

@_subject: [Cryptography] traffic analysis -> let's write an RFC? 
Energy-Efficient Ethernet was adopted as the IEEE Std 802.3az-2010
amendment to the 802.3 standard and has since been rolled into the
802.3 base standard (now 802.3-2012) where it is Clause 78. The 802.3
base standard document is so gigantic that it is divided into 6 parts.
This is in 802.3-2012_SECTION6 that you can get for free from
Right. Link level security, including padding / fake packets is the
way to go.
You would expect link level security to be done by the organization
that specifies that link technology. Just what header fields exist and
which of them can be encrypted or need to be authenticated but can't
be encrypted, what limits their are on the packet size / re-ordering /
fragmentation and re-assembly / aggregation, etc., all affect link
There is a fairly reasonably standard for Ethernet (i.e, 802.3) link
security.  It is IEEE Std 802.1AE-2006 (as amended by 802.1AEbn-2011
(GCM-AES-256) and 802.1AEbw-2013 (Extended Packet Numbering)), all
available from  and
is commonly known as MACsec. There is widely available hardware
support for 802.1AE. This is really specific to 802.3. For example I
believe it has some awareness of the padding needed because of minimum
Ethernet frame sizes. In my opinion it should have been an 802.3
standard (or the 802 Security WG, 802.10, should have been revived but
that's another story).
(By the way, I don't like the style of 802 documents, but your mileage
may vary...)
Key agrement/management is not specified in 802.1AE. It assumes you
would use 802.1X (which in turn uses EAP) but you could use some other
scheme to key 802.1AE.
If this is link level, why does it have anything to do with IPv4/IPv6?
Just doing it for IPv4 and IPv6 would help but what about ARP which is
essential for but not part of IPv4? Or, in the real world, what about
MPLS or TRILL or the like which are used to transport traffic over
links and would encapsulate IP?
tags are just a sequence of bytes that are part of the payload without
any semantic content.  But that is because 802.1AE is really at the
802.3 link level in that it operates just between adjacent Ethernet
ports. If, say, Router A (RA) is talking to Router B (RB) directly
over Ethernet, then 802.1AE secures the traffic between the RA port
and the RB port. But if, say, there is an intervening customer bridge,
then it would secure the traffic between the RA and RB ports and the
bridge ports to which they directly connect, leaving traffic in the
clear inside the bridge (although, of course, it could have been
encrypted at a higher layer like IPsec).
This seems to correspond to what you were contemplating above since
any synthetic traffic need only be one 802.3 hop.  This is also
inherent in the way 802.1AE works and the way 802.1 VLAN aware
bridging works. Since 802.1AE is VLAN ignorant, just as 802.3 is, it
just pushes a tag on the front of the frame and encrypts everything
after that, including any VLAN tags that might be there. But bridges
enforce VLAN separation and so must see the VLAN tags to be sure they
don't send a frame in one VLAN to a station not authorized for that
I would call essentially all of Wi-Fi "connection based"; not just
Infrastructure mode where you have an Access Point (AP) and associated
non-AP stations but also ad-hoc (IBSS) mode, mesh mode peering,
etc. That is because it is essential that Wi-Fi stations come to
agreement on the frequency and bandwidth they are using, the data
speeds/modulations available, as well as normally having to agree on
QoS parameters and security before they communicate any data, not to
mention beam forming and MIMO stuff.  This requires what could very
reasonably be called a "connection protocol" before you can ship any
(The only exception is OCB mode (Outside the Context of a BSS, aka
802.11p) which is what will be used for the so called ITS (Intelligent
Transportation System) 802.11 stuff between vehicles and between
vehicles and roadside equipment. The timing constraints there are so
tight you just send a data frame and hope for the best, which requires
fixed pre-specification of frequency, bandwidth, data speed, etc.)
People from the wired world usually fall into the trap of thinking
that Wi-Fi is just another physical medium, perhaps as trivially
different as copper and fiber are from each other. Not so.
By the way, I am the Chair of the 802.11 Task Group (802.11ak) that is
working on an amendment to the 802.11 standard so that 802.11 links
can be use as through links inside networks as well as links to leaves
at the edge of the network. (That was already true for Wi-Fi mesh but
what people are really interested in is using AP to non-AP station
links as through links in a standard way (many proprietary systems do
this now).) What with multi-gigabit 802.11ad links, people
increasingly want to do this, even inside data centers for overflow
traffic and the like.  See
 There has already
been some informal pressure from wired folks to, for 802.11ak links,
make 802.11 security "~compatible~" with 802.1AE.
802.11 (Wi-Fi) is an entirely different link technology and as such it
inherently needs security with different details. WPA (Wi-Fi Protected
Access) is a creation of the Wi-Fi Alliance, an industrial group, not
part of the standard, and it just has to do with keying as I
understand it.  The basic formats and algorithms (ignoring the early
algorithms adopted due to hardware limitations and which are now
deprecated) are OK as far as I know. 802.11 security doesn't require
that you use passwords and, if you do, doesn't require that the
password be the same for all associating stations, and even if the
password is the same, I believe you have to observe the initial
handshake as their are nonces involved such that the pairwise keys
between an AP and each associated station are different even if they
used the same password. 802.11 Security is mostly in Clause 11 of IEEE
Std 802.11-2012 (available free from
 (you may be
noticing a pattern here)).
For examples of the differences, the only real "header" on an 802.3
frame is the Destination Address / Source Address and the trailer is
the padding sometimes required on short frames and the CRC. The 802.11
frame is much more complex with a variety of types (see Clause 8 of
IEEE Std 802.11-2012) so there is additional meta data that needs
authentication.  Then there is the level security operates at.  For
802.3, it is a frame. But 802.11 operates in such a variety of
environments and modes that, to help with the overhead of acquiring
the over-the-air channel, it has three different types of aggregation
(MSDU (MAC Service Data Unit) aggregation, MPDU (MAC Service Protocol
Unit) aggregation, and PPDU (PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence
Procedure) Protocol Data Unit) aggregation. And, to help when things
are noisy, it has fragmentation.  802.11 security is at the fragment
level, not the frame level, so you can't screw up the receiver by
injecting lots of fake fragments.
People from the wired world, at least the higher end wired world, tend
to view link security as something very expensive requiring special
hardware deployed only in special high risk cases. People from the
802.11 world realize that their communications are always exposed and
at risk so security hardware is always built into the chip sets. Since
the hardware is always sitting there anyway, 802.11 people tend to
consider encryption free and it is almost always used.
802.15 (Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc.) is working on security and I feel
reasonably confident that, at the low level, 802.3, 802.11, and 802.15
security will not be compatible.  But things could be compatibility at
other levels, like using the same certificates if you choose to do
certificate based authentication or the same crypto algorithms.
Perhaps improved key agreement and algorithms including padding for
802.1AE is the way to go...  There is currently an amendment in
progress for 802.1AE designated 802.1AEcg
( to specify transparent
MACsec devices which may or may not be relevant.
PPP is a link technology standardized by the IETF so here is a case
where the IETF should specify security for the link protocol.
As you point out, the existing PPP security protocols do not meet
modern standards for security. For a while, I was chair of the IETF
PPPEXT WG (PPP Extensions Working Group) until it was dissolved and I
tried to stir up some interest in updating the PPP security standards
with no success. Of course, it could be that I was just not very
effective in this "stirring up" and/or the PPPEXT mailing list
subscribers were not the best/right audience. I don't think pure
legacy PPP over HDLC is the future. PPP is going to be over Ethernet
or something so I think this can be fixed as the bearer link protocol
layer although there certainly wouldn't be anything wrong with fixing
it at the PPP layer.
Anyway, I'd be happy to participate in an improved link security effort.

Socialism is the collective ownership of the means of production so
that profits/losses flow to the collective and are distributed by a
