Unless I'm mistaken, the 2^63 operation MITM attack referenced in the
original message referred to Double-DES, not Triple-DES.  The original
cited value of 2^63 is incorrect; the Double-DES MITM attack (as proposed
by Merkle and Hellman) is a known plaintext attack that takes 2^57
operations, with 2^56 blocks of storage.
Your provided values are correct for attacking Triple-DES, but I don't
think that's what the original author was referring to.

The FIPS 140 statistical tests are not designed to be used to test the
'goodness' of a design.  (That is not what the self-tests in a FIPS
module are there for, in general)  It is assumed that the implemented
PRNG (Deterministic RNG in FIPS 140-2 parlance) has been evaluated to
verify that it is one of the approved algorithms.  These algorithms
have already undergone extensive design analysis, including extensive
statistical analysis.
In a FIPS module, the statistical random number generator tests
are present to verify that nothing has gone horribly, horribly awry.
Think of it as one step better than the continuous random number generator
conditional test (which, BTW, will pass outputs that simply alternate
between two values).
Ok, so what about _true_ RNGs? (Non-Deterministic RNGs, in FIPS 140-2
parlance)  Well, you're only allowed to use "approved" designs to produce
keys and provide inputs to key exchange/agreement protocols.  (Note that
the _design_ analysis has to occur as a separate process leading up to
the design's approval). At the moment, there aren't any approved designs.
(Ok, in truth, there just aren't any publicly available.  You are allowed
to use any Non-Deterministic RNG approved for Classified use)
If you're trying to do a _design_ analysis, you need to use a set of
tests considerably more extensive than the FIPS 140 Statistical tests.
If you're just testing to see if your particular piece of hardware has
failed, it works reasonably well.
