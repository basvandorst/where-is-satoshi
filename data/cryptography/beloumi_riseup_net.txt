@_subject: [Cryptography] Why Rijndael ?

There is also a paper from Schneier, Fergusson and others:
They claim:
"those that thought security was paramount chose Serpent, while those more
concerned with performance chose Rijndael. Twofish represents a middle
combining the best of both: very conservative security and very good
performance across all platforms."
So it's not so far away from NIST's choice.
But this is from May 2000. Today we are for example more aware about
cache-timing attacks
(but as I can see, non of these Algorithms is cache-timing constant).
