SAN FRANCISCO - Microsoft has acquired a small maker of security software, strengthening its arsenal as it works to improve the security and reliability of its products, the company confirmed Microsoft agreed to purchase all the assets of XDegrees for an undisclosed amount, according to a statement issued by the start-up software maker, in Mountain View, California. Some employees will relocate to Microsoft's headquarters, in Redmond, Washington.
A Microsoft spokeswoman declined to comment on any other details of the deal.
XDegrees makes software to let users securely gain access to and exchange information stored in enterprise computing systems.
