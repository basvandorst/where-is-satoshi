@_subject: [Cryptography] The Trust Problem 
First post in the mailing list so don't shoot me for being a noob or
stating the obvious.
The usual reasons for trust have not and will not change. I do not think
that any cloud based software can expect any level of trust.
Personally I would give more trust to software which has its roots in a
"privacy friendly" political setting and where the developer has no
personal interest or ability to generate any income from it. The latter
would promote more compatibility with other developers which support he
same open encryption standards. PGP would be a nice example.
So choice of vendor would lead to more diversity which would increase the
hassle of an attacker to get a complete picture of the data transactions
within the circle of trust.
Unfortunately developers are currently more interested in creating walled
gardens offering pseudo-security and offering a potential hacker a single
attack vector.
I am sure there are others but for me PGP has always been an iconic example
as an encryption standard which is vendor independent and which can create
secure data exchange between a select group of individuals if they did a
proper offline key exchange. The downside is that it is not very practical,
one of the reasons why probably less than 1% of the internet users use PGP.
Last but not least, no matter what encryption tool you use, do you trust
the operating system and other trojans you might have installed? For an
internet connected machine expect that at least some government and/or
Russian hacker (stereo type) has your private data.

If you are forced by FISA I assume you don't get any compensation for
putting the reputation of your multi-billion dollar organization at risk.
You are correct, the best the NSA could offer was plausible deniability for
Juniper. Even if it really was a 3rd party hack Juniper would cover their
asses by claiming they used "Best Practices" security policies.... As if
that is enough. But it is enough for the general public. "Ooooh.... it must
have been some "2up3r 1337 h4x0r", nobody can protect themselves against

@_subject: [Cryptography] What is encryption good for? - was Re: Hillary 
To be able to have a discussion in private which could have otherwise legal
repercussions. Not only in your own country but also in others. For
example, my religious opinion could put me in jail in some countries. If
secret service agencies (unknowlingly my be) would start to exchange chat
logs, a planned vacation could end up to be much longer and more
uncomfortable. An unplanned transit flight is all you need.
In 2013 Tunesia is already trying to enforce their national laws abroad:
Politics and religion are of course easy examples but prosecusion would not
stop there if the encryptions haters have won that first battle.
Maybe the discussion is easier if we just accept that it is normal that
people have a lot to hide in their daily lives. I do a lot of thing which
are not 'legal'. I drive to fast between the radars, I sometimes forget to
blink, I sometimes look at my mobile phone or ipod. I sometimes axaggerate
on my tax returns. Life would not be possible if you are convicted as soon
as you do or say something wrong. Our law system was not meant to work that
If people would realise this then the argument "f you do nothing wrong, you
have nothing to fear" becomes moot.
So what is encryption good for? Free speech.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Crptographic ticket tape (fake news) 
In securing original footage from tampering would a ticker tape in the
background be viable? The tape would be timestamps encrypted with the
producer's private key.
A local video player could decrypt it and raise an alarm if there are
inconsistencies in the timestamp flow.
Would the ticker tape bandwidth be enough to have large enough keys? As an
alternative you could also have 2d transparent barcodes, they would
probably have more bandwidth and get the player in sync faster.
The advantage of the tickertape is that a human could see the cryptographic
flow and see interruptions and speed changes even when not decrpyting. If
you would do the same but by means of invisible watermarking the only
confirmation you have is that the material is encrypted by a "trustworthy"
(In case somebody forgot what a ticker tape looked like:
Just a thought how to use encryption against doctored videos.

@_subject: [Cryptography] EU pushes for backdoored encryption 
The ORF news agency in Austria got hold of a fast tracked internal EU
resolution which would demand backdoors in end-to-end encrypted messaging
apps like Whatsapp and Signal.
The latest terror attack in Austria is being used to further push this
agenda forward. It seems that when the terrorist was posing with the
weapons on Instagram it was too difficult to decipher.
But don't worry, only the good guys get the key.
