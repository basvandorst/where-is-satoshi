@_subject: Constructing "capability" URLs 
(Pardon the crossposting.)
I'm building a web app which, rather typically of web apps, constructs
URLs on the fly. A URL concocted by my app looks like this:
  The "cap" at the end is supposed to be a capability. ;-)
One of my major objectives in this particular development effort is to
make it easy to automate the blackbox testing of my app. I imagine
URLs such as the above make it so: I can have code that invokes the
above URL without regard to the rest of the system.
(Does this make my app buzzword-compliant with REST, too? ;-)
I'm creating the capability thusly:
  cap = hmac-sha1(key, "/object?action=something&expiry=timeval")
My questions:
1. Is the construction of the "cap" string ok? Should I stir other
info in? (The expiry timeval provides the temporal information.)
2. The key is created from /dev/random. How long should it be? In my
threat model, the key changes every few hours.
3. Any other thoughts?
TIA. Cheers.

@_subject: Swiss ISPs Required to Log and Store Email for Six Months 
Transparent outgoing HTTP proxying has been deployed for years now. Not
too difficult for the ISP to also "provide" transparent outgoing SMTP
proxying. So, even with your own colo mail relay, you'd still want SMTP-over-SSL
whenever possible, between your desktop(s) and your relay, and between your
relay and elsewhere.

@_subject: SSL 
It isn't really. I have built OpenSSL using MSVC, BC and mingw.
I have a file here called openssl-0_9_7_Patch_VisualStudio6.zip culled from
the OpenSSL mailing list. I haven't tried it; if you want, I can send it to
you off-list.
I always suggest learning by doing. The OpenSSL C API is quite big, but
there exists wrappers in Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby, Lisp and possibly
whatever high-level language you can think of. (I have one; see .sig.)
These makes programming OpenSSL more accessible.
While your test programs are running, use ekr's excellent ssldump to see
the stuff happening on the wire.
There is also a book called SSL and TLS Essentials by Stephen Thomas that
just describes the protocol. Refer to the book while you're running your
programs and marveling at ssldump's output.
Have fun.

@_subject: Maybe It's Snake Oil All the Way Down 
[ Resend to cryptography@ only coz the earlier attempt failed. ]
Start by looking up the OpenSSL wrappers for your favourite high-level
"scripting" language. There exists wrappers for Perl, Python, tcl, Ruby,
etc. Some popular languages have several.
Many of these programming language environments come with HTTP server
implementations, and many of the OpenSSL wrappers hook into said HTTP
server code to add HTTPS, and a number demonstrate how to do client-side
My M2Crypto adds HTTPS to the popular web application server Zope
( and has some code to hook client-side certificates into
Zope's own user authentication machinery. (By faking HTTP basic
authentication, just like Apache's SSL do.) Once you have that, you can
choose to serve whatever content you want.
It seems HMAC'ing cookies are getting popular for this purpose.
OpenACS, another popular web application server uses this:
   My Python crypto kit has an implementation of the scheme described here:
    I'll be interested to hear this list's view on such schemes. From my
app-plumber's perspective, such a technique for is good enough provided it
is 'secure' enough.
People understand passwords. Private keys, certificates, smart cards, etc.,
are more difficult. (I recall a paper on PGP UI useability testing called
"Why Johnny cannot encrypt" or something like that.)
Actually, this is the crypto-wielding-open-source-hacker-wannabe's wet
dream: So what you need now to track (or generate strong) passwords is a
GUI "password safe"! (Like the one offered on (the old?) Counterpane site.)
Again, Perl, Python, Ruby, yada yada, you name it, people are going to
implement them for free. ;-)
Especially since there are usually 3-5 GUI toolkits and 2-4 database toolkits
for these language environments. Enough combinations to suit everyone.

@_subject: Session Fixation Vulnerability in Web Based Apps 
Dynamic programming environments like Lisp, Smalltalk and Python allow
the application programmer to replace parts of a framework with other code
Lisp does it better than Python. Dunno about Java, PHP, whatnot.
Build your applications with a superior programming system.

@_subject: Open Source (was Simple SSL/TLS - Some Questions) 
Still coming back to SSL, it seems SSL VPNs are getting bigger: just got a
press release that some big firewall vendor (who has an IPsec appliance
product) has acquired some (big?) SSL VPN appliance vendor.
I believe SSL VPNs are easier than IPsec to deploy and operate for the road
warrior accessing corporate resources. This may eventually restrict IPsec's
utility to site-to-site tunneling (useful when, e.g., one wishes to run
OSPF over the tunnel), which _should_ be far easier to configure without
needing the help of some whizbang AI.
