Right!! Thanks for pointing that out.
That explain the GF128 multiplication and the first xor in XEX: there
is need for a good mixing of the block index with some additional
secret key material before xoring the plain text.
But now I am wondering, what value the final xor in XEX is adding ? (I
don't question that it should be done, its cost is really
insignificant compared to the GF128 multiplication, just curious about
which twisted attack it aims to prevent)

Sorry I substituted GCM in place of GF128 multiplication.
2 encryption sounds not bad at all compared to XEX indeed, thanks for
pointing that out + the "scoop" on the EME patent.
In my use case I am actually better off with a "narrow" block size: I
am working at the file access level, not at the "block device" level
(when I used block in my description, I was referring to AES blocks).
As a result, a program may ask to write as little as 1 byte in one
block in many different blocks (I guess this is what would happen if
someone update an entire column in excel). If I work with a wider
block, the overhead of encryption will blow up in such use case.
Anyway fully agree, the wide spread availability of hardware
acceleration for AES is biasing comparison with alternative ciphers,
that's just the way to go.
