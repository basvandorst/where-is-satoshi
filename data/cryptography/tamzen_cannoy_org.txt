Repeat after men. "Encryption is not the problem."
What you described is pretty much PGP Universal. Traffic analysis is the problem. Individual computers can be tracked thru the internets with mere timing signatures on the packets given off by their clocks. Watch this. And that was academic research 7 years ago. You think things haven't progressed since then?

@_subject: [Cryptography] RSA Key Extraction via Low-Bandwidth Acoustic 
Hash: SHA1
"Many computers emit a high-pitched noise during operation, due to vibration in some of their electronic components. These acoustic emanations are more than a nuisance: they can convey information about the software running on the computer, and in particular leak sensitive information about security-related computations. In a preliminary presentation (Eurocrypt?04 rump session), we have shown that different RSA keys induce different sound patterns, but it was not clear how to extract individual key bits. The main problem was that the acoustic side channel has a very low bandwidth (under 20kHz using common microphones, and a few hundred kHz using ultrasound microphones), many orders of magnitude below the GHz-scale clock rates of the attacked computers.
In this paper we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack, applicable to GnuPG?s current implementation of RSA. The attack can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We experimentally demonstrate that such attacks can be carried out, using either a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone placed 4 meters away.
Beyond acoustics, we demonstrate that a similar low-bandwidth attack can be performed by measuring the electric potential of a computer chassis. A suitably-equipped attacker need merely touch the target computer with his bare hand, or get the required leakage information from the ground wires at the remote end of VGA, USB or Ethernet cables."

1) Cut down the original you're quoting to only the relevant portions
to minimize the amount of reading the 1600 people who will

2) Do not top post. I've explained why repeatedly.
3) Try to make sure what you are saying is interesting enough and

There are a lot of new people subcribed to the mailing list, so here is a reminder and refresher of the rules of engagement.
"On topic" discussion includes technical aspects of cryptosystems, social repercussions of cryptosystems, and the politics of cryptography such as export controls or laws restricting cryptography. We will end discussion when not much new is being said. Be polite in disagreement, etc. Not all discussions are valid on this list and there are other lists like Cypherpunks and Randombit where they may work better.
Discussions unrelated to cryptography are considered off topic. Here's the periodic reminder from Perry of the rules of the mailing list.  We've got a very large number of participants on this list. To make the experience pleasant for everyone please:
1) Cut down the original you're quoting to only the relevant portions
to minimize the amount of reading the 1600 people who will
be seeing your post will have to do.
2) Do not top post. I've explained why repeatedly. Yes we know a lot of mail systems do this now. We donât care. Donât top post.
3) Try to make sure what you are saying is interesting enough and
on topic. Minor asides etc. are not.
The list is moderated for a reason, and if you top post a one liner
followed by a 75 line intact original, be prepared to see a rejection

It appears Apple has acted in this mess on Friday.

Blocking Trust for WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2
Certificate Authority WoSign experienced multiple control failures in their certificate issuance processes for the WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2 intermediate CA. Although no WoSign root is in the list of Apple trusted roots, this intermediate CA used cross-signed certificate relationships with StartCom and Comodo to establish trust on Apple products.
In light of these findings, we are taking action to protect users in an upcoming security update.  Apple products will no longer trust the WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2 intermediate CA.
To avoid disruption to existing WoSign certificate holders and to allow their transition to trusted roots, Apple products will trust individual existing certificates issued from this intermediate CA and published to public Certificate Transparency log servers by 2016-09-19. They will continue to be trusted until they expire, are revoked, or are untrusted at Apple’s discretion.
As the investigation progresses, we will take further action on WoSign/StartCom trust anchors in Apple products as needed to protect users.

Happy New Year. Today I found that most of the lists posts held for moderation had forgotten the rules whereby this list remains a productive and informative place to be. I let them thru TODAY ONLY because I’m a nice person, but consider yourselves warned. :). So here is your reminder.
Be Polite, Don't Top Post, and Trim The Quotes.
There are a lot of new people subcribed to the mailing list, so here
is a reminder and refresher of the rules of engagement.
"On topic" discussion includes technical aspects of cryptosystems, social repercussions of cryptosystems, and the politics of cryptography such as export controls or laws restricting cryptography. We will end discussion when not much new is being said. Be polite in disagreement, etc. Not all discussions are valid on this list and there are other lists like Cypherpunks and Randombit where they may work better.
In the course of a heated technical discussion where people have
strongly held views, it is often tempting to get personal about
things. However, this rarely improves the quality of a discussion.
If you're having a technical discussion, and you mention the other party at all or address them directly at al, other than to acknowledge them or ask for clarification, something may be quite wrong. There are rare times
when this rule fails, but usually, it is a good tip-off.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Millions of high-security crypto keys crippled by 
"The flaw resides in the Infineon-developed RSA Library version v1.02.013 , specifically within an algorithm it implements for RSA primes generation. The library allows people to generate keys with smartcards rather than with general-purpose computers, which are easier to infect with malware and hence aren't suitable for high-security uses. The library runs on hardware Infineon sells to a wide range of manufacturers using Infineon smartcard chips and TPMs. The manufacturers, in turn, sell the wares to other device makers or end users. The flaw affects only RSA encryption keys, and then only when they were generated on a smartcard or other embedded device that uses the Infineon library.
To boost performance, the Infineon library constructs the keys' underlying prime numbers in a way that makes them prone to a process known as factorization , which exposes the secret numbers underpinning their security. When generated properly, an RSA key with 2048 bits should require several quadrillion years—or hundreds of thousands of times the age of the universe—to be factorized with a general-purpose computer. Factorizing a 2048-bit RSA key generated with the faulty Infineon library, by contrast, takes a maximum of 100 years, and on average only half that. Keys with 1024 bits take a maximum of only three months."
