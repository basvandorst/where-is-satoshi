@_subject: VISA: All Your Password Are Belong to Us 
I took a look at the description of the scheme, with links at:
It seems pretty straightforward.  When a merchant gets a customer's
card number, the merchant queries (via an SSL link) a Visa server to
find out whether the card has a password.  If it does, the merchant (or
apparently some componentware of Visa's) asks for the password or
a smart-card swipe and sends that along, again via SSL, with the
rest of the transaction data for approval.  The incentive for the
merchant is that Visa promises that password-verified transactions
aren't subject to some kinds of chargebacks.  Nobody expects many
people to sign up for this any time soon.
Other than the inherent problem that all software has bugs, I don't
see any obvious horrible gaping holes, although I was a wee bit
surprised that when I followed the card signup link on Bank of
America's web site I ended up in the cyota.com domain, a software
vendor in Israel, although traceroutes showed that the server in
question was at a web hosting company in Georgia, which is neither in
Israel nor in North Carolina or California where the bank's main
offices are.  Why does this not make me feel more secure?

Of course, but the difference is that Windows users routinely install
programs that update libraries in random ways, Unix users don't.  By
and large, Unix applications only install libraries unique to the
application, and the general stuff only changes when you upgrade the
operating system.  If you're moderately clueful (a big assumption, I
know) the applications aren't installed as root so they can't whomp
the system libraries.  Most Windows applications, on the other hand,
come with copies vendor C libraries, graphics libraries, and who knows
what else, and just install them in \Windows\System.
It's a very common problem on Windows systems to have programs
mysteriously stop working because the user installed an unrelated
application that happened to use the same DLL, but the newly installed
version is older than the previous one and is missing features or bug
fixes.  The current generation of install software tries to check
version numbers and warn you if it's about to downgrade a library, but
it's entirely a convention in the installation software, not enforced
by anything.

I believe that both of these sentences are true, but I don't see any

The minor one is that technically we have no idea how to implement
them.  The major one is that users hate the idea.  Look at Andy
Odlyzko's work on pricing of communications, and you'll find that the
trend has always been away from nickel and dime per unit charges
toward flat rate subscriptions.  That's why all of us cell phone users
and dialup Internet users have plans with bundles of service, even
though it'd usually be cheaper on average to go a la carte.

tiny payments, Peppercoin would work.  But is there any reason to

I have a note from someone telling me how wonderful NTRU's public key

So I have two sort of related questions:
a) Are they for real?  It's fully published and all that, but my abstract
algebra is pretty rusty.  Poking around on the net I found a paper from
France claiming to have cracked their signature algorithm (but not the
underlying crypto scheme.)
b) For applications like toll passes, who cares?  In these applications,
the vendor generates the key and sends out the dongle to the user, and the
dongle only validates against the vendor's system.  (The Mobil/Exxon
speedpass is another example.)  I would think that rather than going to
the computational expense of public keys, it'd be just as secure to send
back a hash of a challenge phrase and the dong;e's key.  This means that
the vendor keeps all the secrets, but in this case so what?  I can tell
you from experience that the main security problem with speedpass is that
you lose it not high-tech cloning, and I'd think that if a bad guy were
planning to clone the dongles, the nature of the algorithm performed on
the dongle's secret key wouldn't make any difference.
TIA and all that.

@_subject: The real problem that https has conspicuously failed to fix 
I think there's two separate problems here.  One is domain squatting.
I've seen lots of phishes from domains like paypal-confirm.com (which
is registered to someone in Pakistan.)  It is truly pitiful that with
all of the anti-squatting nonsense involved with ICANN and their UDRP,
and despite the cases cases we've read about with trademark owners
suing everyone who registers "bigcorp-sucks.com", people still
register deliberately confusing domain names in bad faith for fraudulent
purposes and get away with it.
The other issue, as someone else noted, is that html, like just about
everything else on the net, wasn't designed to be secure and unless
you're going to go reading the source code of every form you use, you
can't tell where your information is going.
I can't see that either of those issues can be addressed by
cryptography.  Crypto lets someone say "Hi!  I absolutely definitely
have a name somewhat like the name of a large familiar organization,
and I'd like to steal your data!" and lots of users will say "OK,

[Moderator's note: I'm allowing through this one last message, but
 we've really, really gotten off topic here. --Perry]
I doubt it, since the person forwarding it isn't the NYT or Topica and
the messages you're describing don't sound like they meet the
definition of commercial e-mail where the "primary purpose" has to be
commercial.  Remember, laws are not software, and they're interpreted
by judges, not by C++ code.  Maybe there's a crazed Attorney General
somewhere who would want to file such a case, and he could find an
even more crazed judge who wouldn't laugh it out of court, but I
wouldn't lie awake at night worrying about it.
Even beyond the reasons above that they wouldn't, if you'd read
sections 4(a)(3) and 4(a)(4) of the bill, you'd know the answer is no
since the rules about false domain info apply only to bulk mail.
Is that a message "the primary purpose of which is the commercial
advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service"?  I
suppose that there might be a judge somewhere so twisted that he would
think so, but for me it fails my standard is-it-more-likely-than-
being-hit-by-lightning test.
Right, and if you look at the definitions in this bill, you'd know
that this interpretation of it is ridiculous.  Insofar as this bill
regulates anything, it regulates advertising mail, not mail with
incidental mentions of magic words.
Hmmn, I guess you missed definition (3)(15) about routine conveyance,
the description of which includes every anonymizer I've ever seen, and
definition (3)(9) which confirms that routine conveyance does not
count as initiating a message.  The person who sends the spam through
the anonymizer may be breaking the law, but the operator of the
anonymizer isn't.
As I've been saying, there are plenty of things wrong with this bill,
but outlawing anonymous non-spam isn't one of them.  I would be much
more concerned that it gives a green light to big companies that have
been waiting on the sidelines to fill our mailboxes with so much
garbage that we can't find the trickle of real mail.  Think of it as
reverse steganography.

Here in the northeast where E-ZPass is much more established, the

and the left lanes running under a grid of pass readers where you
don't even slow down.  The prepay increment is only $15.

Seems moot now.  The 407 toll road around Toronto has no toll booths

otherwise, they take a picture of your plates, look you up, and mail
you a bill.  This does work -- I've gotten a bill for my NY car after

the transponder is completely optional, and won't save you any money
unless you use it more than 7 times a year.  (The transponder costs
$2/mo and saves $3.45 per trip.)
The easiest way to get a transponder appears to be to drive on the
road, wait until you get a bill on which they will have assigned you
an account number, then use that number to log into their web site and
order one.

Just last week I was trying to figure out what the difference was
between a StarterSSL certificate for $35 (lists at $49 but you might
as well sign up for the no-commitment reseller price) and a QuickSSL
cert for $169.  If you look at the bits in the cert, they're nearly
identical, both signed by Geotrust's root.
As far as the verification they do, QuickSSL sends an e-mail to the
domain's contact address (WHOIS or one of the standard domain
addresses like webmaster), and if someone clicks through the URL, it's
verified.  StarterSSL even though it costs less has a previous
telephone step where you give them a phone number, they call you, and
you have to punch in a code they show you and then record your name.
Score so far: QuickSSL 0.0000001, StarterSSL 0.00000015.
Both have various documents available with impressive certifications
from well-paid accountants, none of which mean anything I can tell.
Under some circumstances they might pay back some amount to someone
defrauded by a spoofed cert, but if anyone's figured out how to take
advantage of this, I'd be amazed.
Comodo, who sell an inferior variety of cert with a chained signature
(inferior because less software supports it, not because it's any less
secure) is slightly more demanding, although I stumped then with
abuse.net which isn't incorporated, isn't a DBA, and isn't anything
else other than me.  I invented some abuse.net stationery and faxed
them a letter assuring that I was in fact me, which satisfied them.
Back when I had a cert from Thawte, they wanted DUNS numbers which I
didn't have, not being incorporated nor doing enough business to get a
business credit rating, so they were satisfied with a fax of my county
business license, a document which, if I didn't have one, costs $25 to
get a real one, or maybe 15 minutes in Photoshop to make a fake one
good enough to fool a fax machine.  I gather that the fancier certs do more intrusive checking, but I
never heard of any that did anything that might make any actual
difference, like getting business documents and then checking with the
purported issuer to see if they were real or, perish forbid, visiting
the nominal location of the business to see if anything is there.
So the short answer to what's the difference between a ten dollar cert
and a $350 cert is:   $340.

Although some certs make more intrusive checks, it all strikes me as
security theater.  In particular, although some of them make some
effort to verify that I am who I say I am, I don't see any of them
making any effort to verify that my web sites are what they say they
are.  It would be an interesting experiement to register, say,
PAYPAL-VERIFICATION.COM (which is available) with my own info in
WHOIS, then apply for a cert from Verisign saying that it's me, and
see if they ask if I'm Paypal.  My guess is that they wouldn't.
Treating CAs differently would be a fine idea if there were a real
difference, but $300 or $1000 still isn't anywhere close to what it
would cost to do a meaningful investigation of someone's identity.
I've been proposing for a while that we try industry-specific branded
certs.  The branding would put a logo in the signing cert (there's
already a field for it) and adjust browsers to display the signing
cert's logo in a place where users can't put anything else, e.g., the
corner that usually displays the IE "e" or Firefox bat.  Industry
specific means that the certs would be issued by a regulator or
industry association who already knows who the legitimate entities
are, such as the FDIC for banks in the US, so there's no extra step of
introducing the certified parties to the certifier.
The point of branding the signer is that you then have a single brand
that you want to tell people to look for, e.g. "Would you bank at an
office without the FDIC logo in the window?  Look for the same logo
on your bank's web site."
There remain some issues, notably how you keep fake signing certs out
of computers of people who will click the OK box in a window that says
"Harvest all your account numbers and steal all your money?"  But it
seems to me a reasonable approach to more credible online identity for
often-faked targets.

I've actually found them more useful for cancelling subscriptions than

You know, we've already had all these arguments on the DKIM mailing

with every other signature scheme.  The salient difference is that
DKIM sets its sights lower and is designed to be more easily
deployable so there is more of a chance that it can break out of the
ghetto where all the existing message signature schems languish, and
at least increase the amount of mail that peoples' known
correspondents have signed.  Despite a great deal of misreporting and

spam nor against phishing.

Not really.  What's missing is, if you'll pardon the phrase, a central
point of failure.
If you can persuade everyone to use a single system, it's not hard to
make communication adequately secure.  Look at Hushmail; if you
believe that their internal processes are OK, you can set up an
account and communicate quite securely with other Hushmail users on
their web site, or for the more nerdy, you can use SSL IMAP and PGP to
communicate with their central site.  It's been limping along since
1999, I don't know anyone who uses it which says something about its
actual utility.
But that's not e-mail.  The great thing about Internet e-mail is that
vast numbers of different mail systems that do not know or trust each
other can communicate without prearrangement.  And of couse the awful
thing about Internet e-mail is the same thing.  It's hard to see any
successful e-mail system in the future, secure or otherwise, that
doesn't do that, since Internet mail killed all of the closed systems
that preceded it.

Then you just change the attack model.
There are a bunch of sites that do various things with your address
book ranging from the toxic Plaxo which slurps it up and sends spam to
everyone in it masquerading as an address change message from you to
more reasonable ones like LinkedIn which offers controlled messaging
to friends of friends.
Since typing in address book info by hand is hard, a lot of them sync
with your existing Outlook addressbook via a plugin, and some of them
also offer to sync with your Yahoo or or Gmail or Hotmail address
book.  What a bad idea -- those are single signon systems. If you've
ever bought anything at one of their hosted stores or use one of their
premium services, it's the same credential that lets people charge
stuff to your credit card.
It gets even messier.  Look at a configurable aggregator page like the
very spiffy Netvibes.  It has modules to check mail at AOL, MSN,
Yahoo, Gmail, and your POP provider, all conveniently remembering your
login info.  As far as I know Netvibes is reliable and competent, but
they have an extension API that lets anyone write extension modules
and offer them to Netvibes users.
I realize that readers of this list will use separate accounts for
financial info and free webmail, but the other 99.9% of people in
the world will be delighted that they only have one password to
write on a post-it rather than six.
It should be obvious why overloading phish protection onto this is an
equally bad idea -- it drops the security of the phish protection to
the security of the sleaziest aggregator module or address book site
that someone might use, and puts valuable financial and antiphish info
in the same security bucket as the three most recent subject lines
from your web mail.  Thanks, but no thanks.

Hushmail is actually kind of a scam.  In its normal configuration,
it's in effect just webmail with an HTTPS connection and a long

for mail it sends and receives, but they generate and maintain their
users' PGP keys.
There's a Java applet that's supposed to do end to end encryption, but
since it's with the same key that Hushmail knows, what's the point?

Have you looked at Hushmail lately?  Before I sent that note, I signed
up for an account and sent myself a few messages to be sure I
understood what happens.  They really did generate a PGP key for me
when I signed up.  At least I think they did, the Java thingie that
was supposed to let me download a copy of the key didn't work, but the
mail arrived with a reasonable looking PGP signature.  It also let me
upload my public key for my regular address so Hushmail users can send
me PGP mail.
If you want Web mail that does PGP inbound and outbound, they do a
perfectly fine job, but I suspect that interception in transit isn't
the threat that most users are worried about.
As far as explaining what they do, here's a typical piece of blurbage
snipped from Hushmail's web site.
  By contrast, Hushmail keeps your online communications private and
  secure. Not even a Hushmail employee with access to our servers can
  read your encrypted email, since each message is uniquely encoded
  before it leaves your computer.
In fact they sent and received my mail through an https web site so
although it is encoded in transit (https from me to them, PHP from
them to the other end), it's in the clear at their end.
That may well be true, but that's not what I got when I signed up last
night.  Take a look, sign up for one of their free accounts, and see
if you agree with my description of what it does.

Right.  I haven't used the end to end Java stuff, but I believe that

their signup process does not say "if you use the web mail we can read
all your mail and will provide it in plain text if suboenaed."
That's what I take issue with, promoting web mail as though it were

That works great so long as the personal data is accurate.
Banks these days are supposed to verify your identity when you open an

some verification questions from historical info in the report.  I'm
regularly asked which of four street addresses I've lived at.
Unfortunately, in my case the correct answer is invariably "none of
them".  I'm part owner of a relative's house in New Jersey, and the
credit bureaus all are sure that since my name is on the deed, that
must be where I live.  So that's the address that shows up.  Adding to
the excitement, they often ask what city, to which the answer would
still be none of them even if I lived in that house.  It's in
Lawrenceville, but I guess it gets mail delivered from the Trenton
P.O. so the allegedly correct answer is Trenton.
It's not too hard for me to figure these out, but given the amount of
plain wrong info in credit reports, this approach must lead to some
pretty frustrating failures.

This scheme is quite popular with banks.  I have at least three

account along with a caption I wrote.  They have a large library of
pictures of cute animals, household appliances, and so forth.
Clever though this scheme is, man-in-the middle attacks make it no
better than a plain SSL login screen.  Since the bad guy knows what
site you're trying to reach, he can use your usercode to fetch the
shared secret from the real site and present it to you on his fake
site.  It's true, the fake site won't have the same URL as the real
site, but if the security of this scheme still depends on people
scrutinizing the browser's address bar to be sure they're visiting the
site they think they are, how is this any better than an ordinary
kitten-free SSL login screen?
Another bank sent me a dongle that generates a timestamped six-digit
number that I use as part of the login.  Even with the dongle, MITM
attacks are still effective.  The bad guy can only steal one session
rather than a user's permanent credentials, but that's still plenty
to, e.g., wire money out of the country.
The only thing I've been able to come up with that seems even somewhat
secure is a USB dongle that plugs into your computer and can set up an
end-to-end encrypted channel with the bank, and that has a screen big
enough that once you've set up your transaction in your browser, the
bank then sends a description to the dongle to display on its screen,
and YES and NO buttons on the dongle itself.
Unless the screen and the buttons are physically part of the dongle,
you're still subject to MITM attacks.  But a dongle with a screen big
enough for my 87 year old father to read, and buttons big enough for
him to push reliably would be unlikely to fit on his keychain.  It's a

Hi.  One of the hats I wear is the chair of the Anti-Spam Research
Group of the Internet Research Task Force, which is down the virtual
hall from the IETF.
You know how you all feel when someone shows up with his super duper
new unbreakable crypto scheme?  Well, that's kind of how I feel here.
Dealing with spam is surprisingly subtle, a lot of smart people have
been thinking about it for a long time, and most new ideas turn out
to be old ideas with well known flaws or limitations.
It's not a bad idea.  Its best known implementation was done in 1996
by Robert Hall of AT&T Labs who called it Zoemail.  You can learn all
about it in US Patent 5,930,479.
This is the wrong place to go into detail about its limitations,
although it should be self-evident that if it were effective, sometime
in the past 13 years we'd have started using it.
You're all welcome in the ASRG, which has a wiki at
 with pointers to the mailing list and other
resources.  One of our slow moving projects is a taxonomy of anti-spam
techniques, both ones that work and ones that don't work.  If you'd
like to contribute, drop me a note and I'll give you a password so you
can edit it.

I do that too -- I bet half the people on this list do, and there's
lots of free and commercial services like Yahoo and Spamex who will
let you do it.  But it's not much of a solution to spam because it
requires significant manual work to maintain the addresses, and only
deals with places where you individually give them the address to send
mail to.
This has the same fundamental problem as Zoemail and any other white
list system.  It's really easy to implement a white list.  Unless your
name is Paypal, the amount of mail forging your address is vanishingly
small, and the utterly insecure From: line address works just fine for
practical purposes.  I use that to manage my 12 year old daughter's

introduction problem, deciding whether to accept the first message

that malware infected PCs break all banks' fancy multi-password logins
since no matter how complex the login process, a botted PC can wait
until you login, then send fake transactions during your legitimate

I told him about an approach to use a security dongle that puts the

although I thought it was fairly obvious, he'd apparently never heard
it before.  When I said I'd been thinking about it for a while, he

Agreed.  A display and signing engine would be quite adequate.

better to make an expandable version into which you could plug each

My concern with that would be that if everyone uses the the same
signature scheme and token, the security of the entire industry
becomes dependent on the least competent bank in the country not
leaking the verification secret.
For something like a chip+pin system it is my understanding that the
signature algorithm is in the chip and different chips can use
different secrets and different algorithms, so a breach at one bank
need not compromise all the others.

This might be a good time to consider the possibility that the online
crime economy is more complex than you imagine it to be.
My understanding of the term MITM is that it's a real time attack,
with the bad guy rewrites the traffic and simultaneously pretends to
the customer that he's the back, and pretends to the bank that he's
the customer.  While those attacks do exist, usually as MITB, the most
you can steal that way is what's currently in the victim's account,
which for individuals isn't usually very much.
Also, here in the US at least, the transactions you can do from
individuals' online banking via MITM can all be reversed.  In
particular, international wire transfers are rarely available, and
when they are, they require out of band authentication.  That's why
the MITB attacks you see are always on businesses that do have the
ability to send $50,000 or $100,000 international wire transfers.
There's lots of other bad stuff you can do with people's credentials,
particularly if you have a thorough phish that asks them to "verify"
the information used on a credit application.  The bad guy then
impersonates the victim to apply for a loan at another bank, and makes
off with the proceeds.  Nothing MITM about that.
A lot of phishing has nothing to do with money.  One of the more
popular kinds is phishing web mail account credentials which the bad
guys then sell to spammers, in vast quantities.
PS: This has precious little to do with crypto, other than perhaps
arguing about the merits of out of band authentication approaches:

If people are using clients that don't do SNI, that's because they

it would be no harder to get them to upgrade to SNI browsers, which

The US chip+signature is not as good as chip+pin since there's no to
validate the signature like it can validate the PIN, but c+s prevents
the mag stripe cloning attacks since the terminal doesn't read the mag
stripe.  This works with both the contact cards with visible chips and
the contactless cards that are currently more common in the US.

That's an entirely reasonable concern, since registrars take down

takes over domains that they believe are being used for criminal

On the other hand, since anyone who reads the mail at the WHOIS
contacts for a domain can get a DV certficate anyway, it's not obvious
that this observation makes things any worse than they really are.

On the other hand, floating point numbers are an approximation to
reals, and due to accumulated quantization and rounding errors, a
calculation for which the real result would be zero will often produce
something else in floating point.  It's been about 40 years since I've
had a numerical analysis course, but I recall that a lot of it was
about estimating error bounds so I could decide how different from
zero an answer could be and still be close enough to be semantic zero
for the problem under discussion.
It seems to me there are a lot of places in crypto that have similar
issues, the code we have is only an approximation to the Platonic
ideal, e.g., a Platonic CA would reliably check that alleged identity
exactly equals the real identity, but actual CAs tell us that alleged
identity equals real identity +/- 0.0004715 and we don't have a
very good understanding of how to deal with that.

make an image of the check using a device attached to a point of sale
terminal, a scanner provided by the recipient's bank, or even by taking
a picture of both sides with a mobile phone app.  In some cases where

I realize that's the theory, but in reality, there is a mining pool
that could easily grow to be more than half of all the miners, at
which point it could start ignoring blocks from outside the pool,
which would be to the benefit of people inside the pool.  So long as
the cost of joining the pool remained small, e.g., if you join you
still get 98% of the coins you mine, this looks to me like it would be
a stable situation, no matter how much outsiders complained about how
awful it was.
There also remain long term questions about the technical viability of
Bitcoin, most notably whether people will still find it interesting
after the transaction cost rises.  (If a transaction costs a dollar,
there's a lot of other options with much less price volatility.)
To me Bitcoin is very interesting as an experiment.  It shows that
within certain parameters, the distributed proof of work model is
viable.  I doubt that anyone anticipated the grotesque amount of
computing resources that people would throw at it, or that there would
be mining pools.
The model is likely useful for applications like distributed notary,
particularly if there are several mutually suspicious groups
participating which makes it less likely that any one of them could
take over.

This is wandering away from crypto, so this will be my last round.
That's not surprising.  Bitcoin is a speculative asset, and at this
point the Bitcoin fans have a shared interest in keeping its price up.
The story that nobody's in charge is one of the things that makes
people want to buy it, so, well, sure.  In the admittedly unlikely
event that there are enough contracts or debts denominated in Bitcoin
that there were significant non-speculative demand, things could
change.  Also, were such a thing in the works, I wouldn't count on the
people involved publicly broadcasting their intentions on Twitter.
This is what's technically known as "marketing BS".  Dell accepts
dollars.  They have a deal with Coinbase in which Coinbase takes the
risk of raising dollars by selling Bitcoins in return for a commission
hidden in the bitcoin price.  This is pretty much the same as saying
that Dell takes Hungarian forints because you can pay with a Hungarian
debit card, and Mastercard takes the risk of selling the forints.
Coinbase seems reasonably well capitalized for a small company, but if
there's another collapse in the Bitcoin market and they don't drop
their buy price fast enough, or unload their bitcoin inventory fast
enough, they could collapse like many of their predecessors and fail
to pay their dollar debts to, say, Dell.
Like I said, I think Bitcoin is an interesting proof of concept, and
the distributed notary idea seems likely to be useful for something,
but it's never going to replace real money.

It's certainly true that people don't understand crypto or Bitcoin
very well, but it's not just that.  Bitcoin differs from ordinary
online payments like credit card or Dwolla in a few significant ways.
1.  Bitcoin payments are irreversible.
2.  Bitcoin's value is unmanaged.
3.  Bitcoin payments are somewhat more anonymous.
4.  Bitcoin payments are, for now at least, very cheap.
Everyone agrees that  is an improvement, but for most people,  is
indifferent and  and  are actively worse.  It is not a bug that my
credit card transactions can under some circumstances be reversed, and
it is not a bug that central banks manage currency values to avoid
large fluctuations.  I expect individual readers of this list will disagree about those two
(we need a modified Godwin's law substituting "Zimbabwe" for
"Hitler"), but if you look at the way that ordinary people behave,
paying for a $2 coffee with plastic rather than cash, it's clear
what's important to them.
I expect the main practical effect of Bitcoin will be to put pressure
on conventional payment systems to improve their slow and inefficient
processes, and to reduce the often large margin between the cost of
the underlying service and what they charge the customers.  In the UK,
online payments clear in an hour or two, and never cost anything.  In
the US they take two or three days and often cost a dollar.  What do
they know that we don't?
PS: There's a separate issue of things like zero-knowledge proofs.
It's all very well that it's possible to create software that tells
two people they're near each other without leaking any info to anyone
else, but when you're running the PrivateNearMe app on your device,
unless you are a heavy duty nerd who can snoop on and interpret the
traffic to from the device, there's no way to tell whether it's
actually doing that, or the app's author is logging everything.

We have no idea how much a payment would cost at the steady state.
Remember that bitcoin mining is at some level a zero-sum game, since
the algorithm adjusts the difficulty of the problem so that there's a
new block every ten minutes regardless of how many computrons people
throw at the problem.
At this point it is my impression that we're still in a bubble and
most mining pools are operating at a loss, but eventually the stupid
money will go chase something else.  It'll be worth turning on the
mining equipment if the expected value of the new coins plus the
mining fees exceeds the incremental cost of turning it on, which is
basically the power.  The hardware that already exists doesn't have to
be paid for, it's a sunk cost, and I assume you pay for hosting by the
month, regardless of whether the equipment is running.  So while it's
true that in the current environment, the buyer's fee would have to be
$50 to pay for its share of the cost of mining a block, it's not
unlikely that miners will get discouraged, the problem will get
easier, and the cost will go down.  Also, there are currently about 300 transactions/block or one every
two seconds.  There's room in a block for at least ten times that
many, so if the transaction rate goes up, the cost goes down.
Having said all that, I can see how the cost would get down to a
dollar, or a quarter, but not how it would get down to a fraction of a
cent unless the value of bitcoins totally collapses.  At a quarter,
it's competitive with Paypal and Dwolla.  Whoopee.

They're acting as a bank.  Doing an mPesa transfer is conceptually the
same as writing a check that directs your bank to pay money from your
account to someone else.  The only way to turn it into cash is to take
it to a branch of the bank.  They probably don't have the equivalent
of deposit insurance, but lots of banks don't, either.  (I realize
nobody uses checks in Australia any more, but substitute whatever you
use to tell your bank to pay bills.)
What we seem to be discovering here is that no matter what kind of
electronic currency you use, you have to trust someone.  The only
question is who it is, and what if any recourse you have if they are
crooked or incompetent.

If it takes your money and promises to give it back on demand, that's
pretty much the definition of a bank.  What they do with it is
irrelevant to whether it's a bank.  In the US, S&Ls and savings banks
were largely restricted to mortgages, but commercial banks did
commercial loans, and all of them bought government debt.  These days
the distinctions have been fuzzed away to our detriment, and there are
a lot of shadow banks such as money market mutual funds that act as
banks but outside the regulatory rules.  There is also a move to move
checking accounts into "narrow" banks with 100% reserves of cash and
government bonds, charging customers for the service, so you get what
you pay for and there's no danger of default.
Who can issue checks entirely depends on who is allowed to join the
clearinghouses that settle the checks.  Here in the US it's things
regulated as banks (banks, S&Ls, credit unions) and some others like
American Express (which is not a bank in the US) for travelers checks
and the post office for money orders.  There are multiple
clearinghouses, some operated by the Fed and some private.  I don't
know what the rules for joining are.  Note that physical checks are no
longer settled in the US, just check images.
To bring this back to crypto, none of this applies to Bitcoin or its
clones because they make no promise that you can get your money back.
All you can do is (probably) sell them on to someone else.  I have
likened them to pet rocks without the rocks.  Since there are no
rocks, you have to trust someone to hold your virtual rocks or at
least document where they are.

These were mobile networks with consumer users, not backbones with
fixed MTAs.  The ony mail software you find on mobile consumer
networks is MUAs, which are doing submission, not SMTP.  These days,
any MUA that is submitting over port 25 rather than 465 or 587 is
misconfigured.  I don't know about your mobile device, but on my
Android devices, if it's configuted to do STARTTLS on whatever port
and that fails, the device complains since that would force it to send

@_subject: [Cryptography] STARTTLS, 
Hmmn.  Apparently the answer is "yes".
A few seconds of googlage finds this article, which after you skip
over the breathless bits, tells us that this was port 25 on Cricket
Wireless, a prepaid mobile subsidiary of AT&T, i.e., a consumer
network without static IP addresses or mail servers.
Blocking port 25 on consumer networks to prevent outgoing spam, with
real mail submitted on port 587 with authentication, has been an ISP
best practice for over a decade.  Here, for example, is a
recommendation on the topic that MAAWG published in 2005:
Some large networks, notably Comcast, experimented with rate limiting
or filtering post 25 back in the early 2000s, on the assumption that
there would be fewer support calls than they'd get with outright
blocks.  That turned out to be wrong; when they turned on blocking
they got a spike of calls for a few days while people got their mail
programs reconfigured, then the calls and the spam complaints
disappeared.  The question here is how a part of AT&T a decade later
didn't get the memo.
PS: Some years ago I was talking to someone who worked at the EFF who
proudly told me that she had no spam filters at all, and manually
deleted 3000 spams a day from her inbox. which her management
apparently considered to be productive work.  Doesn't seem like their
understanding of spam problems has changed much.

It uses SUBMIT, which is similar but not identical to SMTP.  See RFC
6409 which updates RFC 4409, published in 2006.  That was eight years
ago, and it's a little dismaying to find people that far out of date
pontificating about how mail works.
MUAs have had port 587 support since about 2006.  If you're running an
MUA that hasn't been updated in eight years, you're probably also
running Windows XP so we're doing the world a favor by forcing you to
upgrade.  Also keep in mind that the networks in question are mobile
carriers, where "legacy" phones able to run an MUA are unlikely to be
more than two or three years old and all can handle SUBMIT correctly.
Ahem.  Port 25 is SMTP, which bots use to send spam directly to
victims on recipient MTAs.  Port 587 is SUBMIT, which MUAs use to send
mail (which might be spam) to their own provider's MTA, which then
takes responsibility and deals with it.
In practice, the vast majority of MUAs are correctly configured to use
port 587, and nearly all of the port 25 traffic from consumer networks
is bot spam.  That's why the best practice is to block it outright,
not try to filter it.  As I mentioned in a recent message, that's been
well known for a decade.

This battle was lost long, long ago.  ISPs routinely intercept
NXDOMAIN DNS results and replace them with A records pointing to a web
server with "helpful" paid ads.  On mobile networks, it's very common
to force web traffic through caches, and to re-encode images to
smaller versions appropriate for the tiny screens.
It's also fairly common to intercept port 25 traffic and force it
through outbound spam filters.  This last bit is about abuse
management, not revenue enhancement.
There's a couple of companies with names I forget (no doubt they want

There's a good reason and a bad reason.
The bad reason is that it violates the holy end-to-end principle, of
which the less said the better.
The good reason is that not all DNS lookups are for web pages.  Pick a
service like mail, SIP, or XMPP, and add a user who mistypes an
address, or a server whose name changed.  Normally NXDOMAIN will tell
the user that something's wrong, but now she gets an A record and
tries to connect to the ISP's helpful box.  If she's lucky she'll get
a different error message, if she's less lucky things will fail
silently, or the server will steal her traffic.  For double extra fun, try running something like a private XMPP server
which checks incoming addresses against DNSBLs to avoid hostile bots,
a common thing to do.  DNSBLs return NXDOMAIN to mean not listed,
which are helpfully corrected to an A record.  Oops.
If you want to do URL correction, the reasonable place to do it is in
the browser where at least you know you're looking for a web page.

People are human, and screw up from time to time.  Your scheme would
work OK if people were perfect, but they're not.  A scheme with no
provision for account recovery or addresses people can remember is
unlikely to be usable outside the tiny niches where people already use
S/MIME or PGP.
The DANE S/MIME approach is pretty simple (after you wave your hands
and assume that system managers will implement DNSSEC anyway.)  The
key for each address is stored in a SMIMEA record in the DNS, so if you
want the signing or verification key for an address, you just do a DNS
lookup.  You can revoke a key by removing it from the DNS, or roll
your keys by adding a record for the new key and later removing the
record for the old key.  The guts are S/MIME minus the PKI, which
works pretty well now.

puts the key in the MIME body.  Once I send you a S/MIME signed

Right.  S/MIME's solution was to require keys to be signed by a well

 the user's system generating a random string of bits based on system

 the user running a key generation algorithm to get a secret key and
 public key using the random string and public parameters;
 the user constructing a proof being a string of bits whose public
 availability does not compromise the secret key and wherein said
 constructing of said proof requires access to said secret key, but at

ETFs hold a pool of assets, which can be anything from the S&P 500 to

Participants, large investors who can swap a large block of ETF shares
for a basket of the underlying assets or vice versa to arbitrage any

I don't think that any normal investors or businesses would be

confident they could turn their blockchain entries into real dollars
in a real bank, with the level of confidence that they have in the

into new blocks, and to turn the blocks back into dollars.  That means
large banks, perhaps the central bank.

Also, the Federal Reserve Bank of NY has a vault which currently

Government debt is different from personal or corporate debt for
several fundamental reasons.  Nation states are immortal and can levy
taxes, so government debt is really a claim on future tax revenue.
Other than the rare situation where the government is so bad at
collecting taxes that it can't collect enough to service its debt (a
problem that Greece may or may not have), it can pay its debts.
Another fundamental difference is that government debt certainly in
large countries, is mostly held by its own residents.  Even though
China and Japan each have over $1 trillion of US debt, still something
like 90% of US government debt is held domestically.  This means that
for the most part, we owe the debt to ourselves.  I have a chunk of it
in my retirement account, for example.  So the debt is really an issue
of redistribution, not of affordability.  The administration of US government debt is quite efficient, with
vanishingly small trade commissions on reasonably large amounts and
zero commission if you use Treasury Direct to buy directly, so I don't
see where something like bitcoin would make a difference.
Bitcoin transactions are currently quite cheap, which now helps to
push down costs in other payment systems, particularly ones like
credit card clearing that aren't very competitive.  But there's no
reason to expect bitcoin to stay cheap forever -- as the mining reward
drops, the transaction fees are going to have to increase.  If the
miners are combined into a handful of small pools, there's no reason
they'd compete on price any harder than Visa, Master Card, and Amex

I wouldn't disagree with the second sentence, other than to nitpick

@_subject: [Cryptography] Bitcoin blocksize limit can be removed 
[ not much to do with crypto, but what the heck ]
Ahem, I didn't say it was the same as bitcoins, only that it was
arguably even worse than bitcoins.  Historically, someone would discover a new source of gold, e.g.
Spanish conquest of South America, the Klondike, the Witwatersrand, a
whole lot of new gold would come on the market, there's be a boom and
inflation, then the source would be worked out, there'd be panics and
deflation, repeat ad infinitum and throw in the Cross of Gold speech.
These days gold mines tend to be marginal, using techniques like
washing old ore dumps with toxic solvents to leach out the last bit of
metal so it depends on a combination of the price and how much
environmental damage they can get away with.
Except that, as you know, the bitcoin algorithm adjusts to compensate
for increases in hashing power.  What if it didn't?
For the first year or so the difficulty factor was 1.  By 2011 it had
climbed to a million, now it's about 60 billion.  Hash rates were
about 1 Gh/s in 2010, now they're about 500 million Gh/s.  So with
constant difficulty, if we were getting a block every 10 minutes in
2010, now we'd be getting roughly a block per microsecond.  Every
Bitcoin pitch I've ever seen has a slide or two on Zimbabwean
hyperinflation so the result would presumably be familiar, give or
take the detail that at that rate all possible bitcoins would have
been mined in the first half minute.  I suppose that given that there
is some real world cost to hash generation, if we imagined that the
limit to the number of bitcoins were removed, we might get some sort
of equilibrium with bitcoins worth 9 or 10 orders of magnitude less
than they are now.
I'm not sure what the overall point here is other than to note that
while one can have opinions about Keynsian economics, one can't
have opinions about arithmetic.

A lot of those inventions date from the era when printing presses were
large and heavy and only found in print shops.  The US is unusual in
that you can get your checks printed anywhere, rather than getting
them from your bank, which rules out most of the techniques unless
you're planning to licence check printers.
Back in 2004, the Check 21 act allowed banks to scan paper checks and
process the images, rather than returning the physical paper, known in
the biz as check truncation.  For recipient banks that couldn't handle
image files they printed them out in a form called a substitute check,
but I haven't seen one of those for years.  As you note, a lot of
checks are now truncated before they get to the bank, by phone apps,
bank websites (one of mine lets me upload scanned images), and point
of sale terminals which as often as not scan your check and the clerk
gives it back to you.
If the check's going to be scanned, most of the anti-forgery
techniques are pointless, since a scanner can't tell nice paper with a
hologram from something you just printed on your deskjet.
The real security in checks is that they can be repudiated, sort of
like credit card transactions.  If you see a bogus check on your
statement, you can challenge it, and there's a bunch of stuff in
the UCC about what happens then.
PS: In Canada you get your cheques from the bank and they have a small
hologram.  In the UK you get your cheques from the bank, but they have
no anti-forgery features I can see.  In France you get your cheques
from the bank, and they have seven digit cheque numbers which the bank
probably links with your account.  I've never used a cheque in France

Consumers vary a lot, older ones write lots of checks, younger ones do
everything with debit cards.
Depends what you mean by "old days".  Until the 1950s, checks were
processed and posted by hand, and accounts were filed alphabetically
by the account holder's name.  In 1950 the Bank of America hired SRI
to automate check processing, which SRI did brilliantly.  First they
invented account numbers, then they invented MICR coding to print the
numbers on checks, and a magnetic reader for them, and then they built
a prototpe machine to read and sort them.  Word got around, banks all
over the country were desperate for them, General Electric got the
contract and built a somewhat improved version with transistors and
core memory rather than tubes and drums.  The commercial version
called ERMA shipped in 1959 and was a huge success.  The GE ERMA team
included the pre-AI Joe Weizenbaum.
Personalized checks were not common, so for the most part, the only
way to tell who wrote a pre-ERMA check was to look at the signature.
My parents had an account at a small bank owned by my mother's uncle
and well into the 1960s the only concession he made to modernity was
to print the bank's routing number on the checks so other banks would
clear them.
Appparently check fraud increased a lot in the 1960s, which would make
sense since that's when banks first could clear checks without anyone
actually looking at them.

The security issues with chip+signature are different from chip+pin
but not necessarily worse.  With chip+pin, if the bank asserts that
someone entered your PIN, you lose.  Ross Anderson has been dealing
with this issue in the UK for many years, finding that there are a
variety of ways that the bank's system treats a transaction as PIN
validated while actually it's not.
With chip+signature, you say that's not my signature, and now it's up
to to the merchant and the bank to produce a signature that looks like
yours.  I realize that the number of merchants who check the signature
these days is approximately zero, but that's not my problem.

@_subject: [Cryptography] programming languages and the people who (don't) 
Huh, programmers who are phenomenally overimpressed with themselves
and know no history.  I've certainly met a few.
C was designed in the 1970s.  Dennis Ritchie's PDP-11 compiler was two
phases and an optional peephole optimizer, each of which could run in
about 24K bytes of RAM. In that environment, the only other language to do system programming
was the machine's assembler, and C was a great improvement, since it
had structures to give names to data fields and enough of a type
structure to keep you from using a floating point value as an integer
or add two pointers together.
The reasons we're still using C are not limited to stupidity.  There
is a huge installed base, including all of the OS code in various
versions of Unix and Linux, and nothing else to date runs on as many
architectures and is as usable in spare environments like OS kernels
and embedded systems.
ObCrypto: very little of the crypto code I use has to run in the kinds
of environments where C's advantages are important, so it's a reasonable
question why application libraries like openssl are still in C.

@_subject: [Cryptography] USG v. Apple, 
This is what some might call an intriguing and innovative
interpretation of the 2nd amendment, and others might call hooey.
For the first two centuries of the American republic, the 2nd
amendment was considered to empower each state to have a citizen army
(the "well regulated militia") which was a big deal before the 1860s
in southern states for putting down slave rebellions.  Since the 1960s
a revisionist interpretation ignores the militia bit and claims it's a
personal right to own weapons, a theory recently endorsed by a narrow
majority of the US Supreme Court.
Throughout all of this, I have never heard of the 2nd amendment being
applied to anything other than guns and physical weapons like
switchblades, dirks, billy clubs and police batons.  It'd be fun to
argue a case that claimed software was a 2nd amendment weapon, but I
doubt it'd get very far.
The Apple brief mostly argues that the government's use of the All
Writs act, a relic from the era when the US government was
bootstrapping itself into existence, was improper since it requires
Apple to create something that doesn't currently exist purely for the
government, unlike normal writs that compel production or records or
in some phone company cases, to use equipment they already had.  They
also as an afterthought make a 1st amendment argument that the
software demanded would be compelled speech, which courts have
consistently disfavored.
The Apple brief is well written and you don't have to follow all the
footnotes to understand it.  Just read it.

No.  (That was easy.)
Digital currencies solve some interesting problems, like a

Real currencies have other characteristics which have little or
nothing to do with technology.  Every successful modern currency has a

Successful payment systems generally have a way to reverse fraudulent
transactions, which requires a human authority to decide what was

No, it just means that the transaction needs a time stamp so the bank
can tell what the CVV should have been.  I don't immediately see that
as a security problem unless you have a bank so dumb that it'll let
merchants do 500 transactions with timestamps two hours apart to try
and guess the CVV.

mules to cash out is the chokepoint in credit card fraud.  You can buy
a gazillion "fullz" with name, address, card number and CVV, for like
a dollar apiece, because they are so hard to monetize.
They will certainly adapt to some degree, but this appears to be a

@_subject: [Cryptography] How to prove Wikileaks' emails aren't altered 
Hash: SHA1
 ... download the messages from Wikileaks and run them though one of
the open source perl or python DKIM scripts.  I did that on a couple
of messages referenced in articles (e.g., the one that said Tim Kaine
was picked a year ago) and yes, the signatures are good.
Pretty hard.  Slightly oversimplified, DKIM makes a SHA-256 hash of
the message body, then another SHA-256 hash of the interesting
headers, one of which includes the body hash, and then puts an RSA
signed version of that second hash in the signature.  The verification key is in the DNS.  Gmail's DKIM keys are not DNSSEC
signed, but since the key used for the gmail-to-gmail messages is the
same one that has been used for hundreds of billions other outgoing
gmail messages over the past four years, it'd be pretty obvious if
someone changed it.
If you're wondering about the details, see RFC 6376.

@_author: John Levine 
@_subject: [Cryptography] How to prove Wikileaks' emails aren't altered 
Rather than guessing, how about reading the RFC?
In principle a signature can contain l=0 which means the body hash
only contains the first zero bytes of the body, but normally it hashes
the whole body so you know the message body you've got is the one it
signed.  Since it takes literally five seconds to download the
messages in question and examine the signatures to see if there's an
l=, I'll leave it as an exercise for the interested reader.
Also, while Jon is correct that the design of DKIM allows anyone to
sign anything, in practice, gmail doesn't let one gmail user send mail
as another. The chances that a signed gmail-to-gmail message is not
what it appears are very low unless you believe that someone has
stolen the DKIM signing key and nobody at Gmail has noticed and
rotated to a new key.
PS: I have to admit I'm surprised that Gmail hasn't rotated the
signing key in four years.  Typical times are one or two times a year.
I rotate mine every month, just because I can.

This showed up this morning.
For a long time Startcom was the only CA that provided free DV
certificates that worked in most browsers.  Their business model was
to upsell you to other stuff.  But they were always rather opaque,
with the opacity reaching the breaking point when they sold themselves
to a Chinese company and didn't bother to tell anyone.
These days there's little reason to use anyone other than Let's

pricey certs, but as far as I can tell nobody cares and the warranties
are so narrowly drawn that nobody's ever collected.
Reply-To: no-reply This is an automatically generated email, please do not reply.
Dear customer,
As you are surely aware, the browser makers distrusted StartCom around a year
ago and therefore all the end entity certificates newly issued by StartCom are
not trusted by default in browsers.
The browsers imposed some conditions in order for the certificates to be
re-accepted. While StartCom believes that these conditions have been met, it
appears there are still certain difficulties forthcoming. Considering this
situation, the owners of StartCom have decided to terminate the company as a
Certification Authority as mentioned in Startcom´s website.
StartCom will stop issuing new certificates starting from January 1st, 2018 and
will provide only CRL and OCSP services for two more years.
StartCom would like to thank you for your support during this difficult time.
StartCom is contacting some other CAs to provide you with the certificates
needed. In case you don´t want us to provide you an alternative, please,
contact us at certmaster at startcomca.com
Please let us know if you need any further assistance with the transition
process. We deeply apologize for any inconveniences that this may cause.

But that's not how shorting works.  If I short 100 shares of IBM,
first I (or more likely my broker) have to borrow those shares from
someone else so I can sell them.  Then when I cover the short, the
shares I bought to cover go back to the person I borrowed them from.
If you're shorting bitcoin ETFs, you'll be borrowing them, too.  Your
broker will require you have enough actual money in your account to
cover your losses if the short turns against you ("margin"), and if
your short goes beyond your margin, they'll make a margin call where
you either deposit more money or they close out your position at a
loss.  Short futures don't have to be borrowed but they have if
anything stricter margin requirements.
"Naked" shorting, where you don't actually have the shares you're
selling, is in most cases illegal for reasons that should be obvious
if you think about it for a moment.  If naked shorting were allowed, I
could flood the market with fake shares, then when people predictably
panic and the price crashes, buy them back and keep the difference.
Or if people resist panic and hold my fake shares, what happens when
the next dividend is declared and the company says to the buyer "who

In article  you write:
I have to say, I couldn't ask for a better example of "blockchains are magic."
Real world markets have all those complex rules about naked short
sales not because they don't know how to make negative ledger entries,
but to prevent market manipulation and outright fraud.  Market
manipulation is from selling fake shares to try to depress the price
before you buy from suckers to cover, the outright fraud is when
someone tries to collect the shares you sold that don't exist and you
don't have them.  That's why you have to borrow any shares you short
(and pay the real owner interest) so the shares you sell are real.
It's also way your broker and regulators have margin rules so when
it's time to collect on a short sale or short futures position, you
have enough to pay what you owe.
Every intro to Bitcoin seems to have a mandatory slide of a 100
trillion Zimbabwean dollar note, and a pompous explanation of how that
can never happen to Bitcoin.  Remember that your Bitcoin wallet
doesn't actually have a balance; the balance you see is just the sum
of all the its transactions.  One of the rules computing that sum is
that the inputs to each transaction have to be at least as much as the
But let's wave our hands and now we have positronic Bitcoins.  We
could repeal the rule about inputs exceeding outputs.  If I want to
sell a thousand bitcoins, I create the transaction, add a nice juicy
transaction fee, and wait for a miner to pick it up.  Because I am a
nice person, I sincerely intend to buy enough coins later to get back
to zero.  What could go wrong?  Personally this is my favorite
approach, since it promptly leads to the Zimbabwe scenario, and puts
Bitcoin out of its misery.
Well, OK, how about a secured deal where you can sell coins you don't
own so long as someone who does have enough coins vouches for you.
Technically that's not hard, but if you think for two seconds,
administratively it's no different from the vouching party selling the
coins since that's who's going to pay when you default, and anything
that happens between you and her after that is outside the scope of
the blockchain.  So there's no reason to put it on the blockchain
since it's just a private loan between the voucher and you.
It's not impossible to do short sales of anything, but the reason
markets have all those rules is not because they are stupid, it's
because they understand all the problems the rules avoid and the
inevitable math when people sell things they don't own.

add some MITM proxies that take newly mined blocks from the Chinese

send them along.
Since a large fraction of the miners are inside China and all of the
hard currency exchanges are outside, this is a pretty serious fork.
No doubt people will start trying to evade the block, but the the GFoC
works pretty well, and any evasion will take a while to start being

A 2012 report from the Fed had these numbers for 2012, all in billions:
26 credit card
47 debit card
 9 prepaid card
22 ACH (electronic bank transfer)
18 paper checks
The average value of plastic transactions is under $100, of ACH about
$2000 and paper checks about $1000.
Add those together and the total is upwards of 100 billion per year,
which is between 3 and 4 thousand per second.  There are obviously
more transactions during the day when people are awake, and a lot of
seasonal variation, like between Thanksgiving and Christmas, so as a
rough estimate you'd need to handle 10,000 per second just to keep up,
not even counting the transactions now done with physical cash.
For anyone who didn't get the memo, Bitcoin is a toy-sized prototype.
That's just the US; there's more people in Europe so I expect they
have at least as many transactions as we do.  China and India have
vast numbers of people and vast numbers of transactions, in India at
least they are mostly in physical cash.
Not to reignite an argument, but I would note that most people
consider it a feature, not a bug, that it's possible to reverse
fraudulent plastic transactions.  So Bitcoin is really only a

reputation of the bank and how far you were from it (one could redeem
the paper only at in person at the bank's office), the value of the
paper varied.  Merchants subscribed to monthly publications like
"Bicknell's Counterfeit Detector and Bank Note List" which described
what the banknotes should look like, since counterfeiting was rampant,
and what they thought the notes were worth.  A very few were worth
par, well run banks might be discounted 1% or 2%, banks on the

pushed hard to provide conventional electronic payments with credit
and debit cards.  I was impresssed how many of the stalls at markets
had handheld card terminals.
I suppose it's fake news the way some politicians mean it, news that I
wish were not true.
The RBI is run by the Indian government, does not issue stock, and
since it is the central bank, has no competitors.  Were we saying
something about fake news?

Bitcoins only exist as long as there is an incentive for people to
mine them, and there are enough miners that users believe that the
miners aren't colluding and the ledger isn't being tampered with.
This means that unlike gold, if Bitcoin's value dropped to zero, the
Bitcoins would disappear.  We can argue how likely this is to happen,
probably a lot more for random alt-coins than for Bitcoin or Ethereum,
but it reminds us how fragile the edifice is.

extremely complex layout rules, and I would not want to guess what
something which was half Devangari and half Arabic would look like, or
how I would enter it.
Also keep in mind that for anything much more complex than accented
latin, the way you enter something on a keyboard and the Unicode that
you end up with often have little or nothing to do with each other.
For Chinese, people type ASCII pinyin and the input method picks the
characters, choosing among homophones by context or by popping up a
menu and asking.  (This includes people who know no English, but they
know enough of the sounds to type the pinyin.)  If my identifier or
password was half Chinese and half something else, I doubt that I
would enter it the same way on my laptop and my phone, or on an
Android and an iPhone, which would make it a pretty poor identifier.
This really is a well studied topic.  Anyone who cares about it should

* The vast majority of non-spam mail is sent in bulk, some through

receipts, shipping notices, and bank statements, quite a lot of
marketing stuff that people have said they'll accept.  Assuming that
the list owner is not a philanthropist willing to pay to subsidize his

* Spammer Y claims that Hacker X broke into his account and sent $100

* There are roughly three billion e-mail users in the world.  How do
you plan to set up accounts for all of them and sell them all stamps?
A large fraction, perhaps now the majority, of mail users are on mail
systems like Gmail and Yahoo and Netease that have no financial
relationship with their users and do not want one.
* Some people are much richer than others.  For example, when I had a

VLIW isn't just wide microcode.  It's a combination of wide

hardware controlled by wide instructions busy.
No kidding.  Trace scheduling was first described in John Ellis'
thesis at Yale.  His advisor Josh Fisher took a bunch of other
students to start Multiflow.  The Multiflow computer worked pretty
well, up to some limits.  One of the things that trace scheduling did
was deep loop unrolling, often with multiple iterations of the loop in
flight at the same time.  It sometimes found that it was running code
a few iterations past the actual end of the loop that had to be
nullified, i.e., speculation.
They tried to avoid using caches and hardware memory bank scheduling
and instead schedule in software to make the memory hardware simpler.
They tried hard to predict statically which references would go to
which memory bank.  That turned out not to work very well, memory
access was less regular than they hoped, which led to bottlenecks
where they had to be conservative about what references might
interfere even though they usually didn't.  After Multiflow ran out of
money, the software was shopped around and people went to multiple
places leading directly to VLIW work at HP and Intel.
Later VLIWs threw more hardware at memory scheduling to avoid
bottlenecks, so I suppose it depends on the details of each implementation
to figure out whether trace scheduled speculation could be used for
side channels.

Unicode is a language for typesetting.  Their goal is that any text in
any living language and most dead ones can be represented as Unicode
characters, and any computer system with suitable fonts and rendering
software can display that text.  But it is a non-goal that there be a
unique Unicode representation of any particular text.  Unicode is full
of homoglyphs, different characters or character groups that display
exactly the same way, and semantic homoglyphs, characters that don't
look the same but that readers would consider equivalent, e.g.,
traditional and simplified Chinese.  You can go down endless ratholes
for languages such as Serbian and Belarusian that are written in both
Latin and Cyrilic, and whether the same word written in different
scripts is "the same".
This makes Unicode a lousy base to use for identifiers and passwords,
but it's what the world uses, so we make the best of it.  The Unicode
consortium and the IETF and ICANN have been working for over a decade

@_subject: [Cryptography] How fast can a blockchain go ? 
Sort of apropos of recent discussions, what sort of performance are
people getting out of blockchains, both transaction rates and latency?
I realize there are designs with intermediaries that aggregate
transactions but if you have to depend on the intermediary you might
as well depend on someone running something fast like DB2.
Bitcoin is presumably the worst case, 10 tps and latency of 20 minutes
to an hour or more if you want to be sure your transactions are

That's Bitcoin.  You can certainly wave your hands and imagine a
scheme where blocks are added faster if they are full of transactions or
something like that.
I see a fair amount of press for something called Zilliqa which
purports to create a high speed blockchain by sharding the chain
somehow.  On the one hand, they've published a fair amount about it,
very little of which I have read.  On the other hand, it's bristling
with snake oil red flags like an ICO where they say everyone has
gotten rich, and a warning banner across their web site saying to
beware of scams and imitations.
Anyone know them?  I don't recognize any of the team on their web site
but they appear to be mostly in Singapore.
Considering that any program large enough to be interesting is large enough
to have bugs, I can hardly wait.

In article <20180310003710.GC3057 at localhost> you write:
Right.  The original and I think still primary goal of Unicode is to
be a typesetting language.  It does that quite well.  I can compose a
message on my phone with, say, emoji of a princess with medium dark
skin waving an Italian flag, and it'll display on a wide range of
devices as recognizable princess and flag.  It is also true that emoji
make horrible identifiers since princess and girl emoji look almost
the same, and adjacent skin tones (there are five) look almost the
same and if you have lousy color vision, Italian and Irish flags look
almost the same.  All this means is that the set of Unicode strings
suitable for identifiers is much, much smaller than the set of all
Unicode strings.
Also right.  If you bother to learn about normalization and IDNA and
PRECIS and label generation rules, you can come up with usable subsets
of Unicode for identifiers.  It's not perfect as the Krebs article
rediscovered; you can't totally avoid homoglyphs, but that is not new
(MICR0SOFT and paypaI) and there are ways to mitigate the damage.
Unfortunately, as we saw in recent exchanges here, some people want
Unicode to be easy ("just give me a list of homoglyphs") and in the
DNS world, there are perverse incentives to sell as many 2LDs as
possible, regardless of how unsuitable they are as identifiers.

What people who have actually tried it have found it is that it only

things look alike.  For example, to someone who speaks English, the
letters O and Ø look similar, but if you speak Danish or Norwegian
they're completely different.  On the other hand, to an English
speaker, 246 and 二四六 look very different, but if you speak Chinese,
they're pretty much interchangable.  This doesn't even scratch the

In article  you write:
For anyone who hasn't been paying attention, DoH is an incredible can
of worms.  Yes, it protects your DNS query stream against snooping,
but you can get that much more cheaply with DNS over TLS or DoT,
described in RFC 8310.
Although there are some uncontroversial uses of DoH (e.g. letting
Javascript apps look up TXT and NAPTR records) its main point is to
hide the DNS traffic in HTTPS traffic and circumvent networks' DNS
filters.  If you believe that network managers are all malicious, a
surprisingly popular viewpoint in the IETF, this is good.  Those of us
who use DNS filters to keep our users away from malware droppers and
botnet command and control hosts, and use split horizon DNS so our
users can use local network resources, find it not good at all.
Where there are politically mandated DNS filters, e.g., the ones in
Quebec against gambling sites that compete with the provincial lotto,
even though it's technically easy to circumvent them, most people
don't.  If the policitians hear that a lot of people are circumventing
them via DoH, we can expect the filters to get a lot more intrusive,
not just using DNS, with a lot more collateral damage.  Be careful
what you wish for.
These two factions have been arguing past each other for at least a year
with no resolution in sight.  The arguments have nothing to do with the
technology of DoH, which is trivial, but with the politics of who controls
what gets onto whose networks.
This has nothing to do with cryptography, so let's not talk about it

This was a pretty low-tech MITM. Bad guy broke into one of the

other real domain, and then did a totally manual MITM editing and
forwarding messages back and forth.
To a large degree this is due to the security hostile, excuse me, user
friendly design of most user mail programs.  They don't show you the
actual From: address on the message, only the comment which is
supposed to be the author's name but can actually be anything.  No
amount of crypto magic will help if the identifer in UI shows you a random string totally controlled by the potentially hostile party.
Also, as it points out in the last paragraph, if you send a million
dollar wire transfer without verifying that the recipient is who you
think it is, what do you expect will happen?
FYI, this lookalike domain trick is a totally standard spear phishing
technique.  Sometimes they break in, sometimes they just poke around a
business' online info to guess who a supplier or customer would be.
The variation is more often substituting rn for m but it hardly
matters since people aren't very good at spotting minor variations

The Fed has a nice chart.  Historically, there were more $1 bills
(number of bills, not value) than anything else, followed by $20.  But

13.4 billion $100 bills which are worth (mental arithmetic here) $1.34
trillion.  By general agreement, nearly all are outside the U.S., stuffed
into mattresses or used to make unreported payments.
The vast pile of unused dollar coins is another story.  No other
industrialized country issues paper notes worth as little as $1, and
tney replace notes with coins as values inflate.  The smallest note is
typically worth about $5.  Japan and Switzerland issue 1000Y and 10f
notes worth about $10 and use 500Y and 5f coins.
A US $1 note is worth 1/10 of what it was in 1950, and the vending
machine industry has long wanted smaller dollar coins that people
could uee in coin slots.  They were behind the Susan B Anthony $1 coin
which was sized so to make it easy to adapt vending machines.  People
thought it was too similar to a quarter so the mint invented the
Sacajawea dollar, turned it inside out so it was a different color
while still electrically the same to coin detectors, and removed the
ridges on the outside.  Then the Congress gave us the presidential $1
coins, four per year.  Through all this there was an assumption
(really a hope) that people would voluntarily use them, or Congress
would let the Fed stop printing $1 notes, neither of which happened,
so the presidential dollars piled up in warehouses.  The Congress
later relented somewhat and the rest of the presidentlal coins were
produced in small quantities, mostly for collectors.
The vending industry appears no longer to care.  Bill acceptors have
gotten a lot better, no doubt due to powerful microprocessors, and
many vending machines now let you tap a credit or debit card.  I like
dollar coins but people look at me funny when I use them.
PS: the vast oversupply of dollar coins led the mint to sell bags of
them mail order at face value, free shipping, charged to your credit
card, which led to arbitrage to collect credit card points.  Guys (it

check, I had a small capital gain or loss.  It quickly became apparent
that the hassle and the risk of using it as a transaction account were
not worth the small interest premium over a money market fund.
If I were a large company, I would do each transaction in a single
accounting currency, and hedge the currency risk separately in the
vast and liquid forex market.  That's a lot easier to keep track of
and solves the same problem.
By the way, if blockchain fans want a really interesting application,
look at the forex market.  It dwarfs everything else at $5 trillion
per day, about 1/3 spot transactions and 2/3 various sorts of forwards
and options to be settled later which would seem ideal for smart
contracts.  It's all direct bank to bank, no central clearinghouses,
and the prices can be kind of opaque and open to manipulation.
Some banks are playing with this.  HSBC has a small scale private
blockchain experiment, per the following press release.  Keep in mind
that "billions of dollars" in the forex market is a rounding error.
Wikipedia says HSBC handle 4.6% of major forex currencies which would
be about $230 billion per day, so over more than a year, their
blockchain had handled one day's worth.

The widely read Lawfare blog had this piece on Central Bank Digital Currencies
and money laundering by a financial crimes analyst:
I get the impression that he doesn't really understand how digital currencies
work.  So please tell me if I'm missing something.  I'm not asking whether CBDCs
are a good idea in the first place, which is a separate issue.
CBDCs are issued as tokens by a central bank, let's call it the Fed.  The
approach seems to be that they're issued in bulk to commercial banks which then
distribute them to their customers following KYC rules.  Then anyone can pay
anyone else using CBDCs.  I presume I pay you by giving you a token which you
present to the Fed, it cancels the token and gives you a new one at which point
you are paid.
He seems to believe that transactions are cleared through the commercial banks,
but I don't see how that works other than perhaps by forcing users to use their
banks as the gateway to the Fed, or I suppose maybe by keeping your tokens in an
account at your bank, which makes it easier to access them from multiple
The article talks about wallets, but if these are bearer tokens, what is a
wallet?  Your device has the tokens or it doesn't.  Maybe these are supposed to
be customer wallets at the bank at which point they smell a lot like
conventional bank accounts.
Since the tokens are all issued by the Fed, they're only sort of anonymous.  If
they decide a token is dodgy or suspicious, the Fed can decline to redeem it or
redeem it only if presented by certain parties. This makes the money laundering
issue easier.  (The author doesn't seem to understand that at all.)  On the
other hand, if the Fed clears all the transactions for free or close to free,
I'd expect a non-stop blizzard of mixing transactions which could have
performance issues as well as money laundering.
He says some other things that are obviously silly, like this enfrachises the
unbanked, not unless they have a smartphone and Internet conenctivity. If they
do, they're already using Square Cash or Venmo and loading money into them at
Or your car could have a CBDC wallet to buy gas or charge itself.  Well, yeah,
if that were a good idea I'd already have given it a virtual credit card number
on my Visa account.
Or we can have micropayments of a fraction of a cent!  A) No, they cost just as
much to clear as macropayments so they're too expensive. A') If you bundle them

The CBDC proposals I've seen fall into two groups, neither of which has anything
to do with blockchain other than perhaps as a marketing gimmick.
One lets everyone set up an account directly at the central bank and
do transactions between accounts. It's sort of a universal version of
prepaid debit cards or Venmo or Square Cash. The counterargument is
that Venmo and Square Cash already do a pretty good job of being Venmo
and Square Cash.
The other issues bearer tokens that take the place of physical cash,
and are intended to be at somewhat anonymous like cash is. In such a
scheme I assume they prevent double spending by clearing transactions
through the issuing central bank, although the discussions are rather
confused and many seem to assume that commercial banks somehow act as
intermediaries, which I don't understand unless they all have a like
connection to the central bank.
There is a lot of handwaving.  For example, that smart contracts would
let people do foreign exchange risk free, by linking the payments to
and from the exchange agent.  That is silly.  When I transfer money
through someone like Transferwise, the risk I worry about is not that
Transferwise will default, it's that the actual exchange rate changes
from the one they offer me.

customers, and at least in Europe, it is still stupidly hard to use

I hope it's obvious why using a revoked unexpired license as an ID is
nothing like an expired SSL certificate -- one still says it's valid,
the other doesn't.  The person validating a plane ticket doesn't check
whether the license is revoked because for this application IT DOESN'T
MATTER.  I'm still me whether or not I'm allowed to drive. The threat model for human IDs and web certificates are rather
different.  People do not change identities from year to year -- if I
am me today I was in previous decades, and will continue to be me
until I die.  That's why the UK can issue licenses good until you're
75, an age presumably chosen as when people need their eyes retested.
Web sites aren't like that.  Domains expire and are sold and recycled.
Back when CA's took the PKI model seriously (the 1990s) they went to
considerable effort to validate the real world identity of anyone
applying for a cert, and put that identity info into the cert.  We saw
a brief resurgence of that with EV certificates.  That's why it did
make some sense to expire and reissue certificates periodically to
recheck whether the package of identity info is still valid.  Now, of course, CAs do no more than check that the party applying for
the cert has some minimal control over the domain name. The only
reason I can see for expiring them is that it's the lazy way to fake

selling the boxes. What happens when all the enthusiasts have bought
their boxes?
They also have a white paper claiming that their boxes use far less
power per GB than conventional cloud storage. Even with hand waving
that their boxes get network connections and routing "for free", that
still seems rather implausible.

In article  you write:
For email agents that are separate programs, they generally open a URL
by passing it to the user's default browser, so the cookie trick
It's true, if for some reason you read your mail in Firefox and do your
shopping in Safari, it won't work, but I don't think that's very common.

In article  you write:
The short answer is that in general, you can't. The slightly longer answer is that when the customer logs in with 2FA
or whatever, the company sends a cookie to the browser or app that has
a session ID. If a mail recipient clicks on the link, assuming the
company has enough sense to make the link in the same domain its web
site uses (some don't), the browser sends along the cookie, and the
company can see if the computer on which she clicked the link already
has a session for the customer to whom they sent the message. If it's
the same, they can skip the login and go straight to the hard sell.
This is pretty typical, leaving a cookie that lets the user continue
an existing session later. That's why they ask the irritating question
about whether this is a shared computer so they can make the cookie
expire quickly instead.

The Elderly University of Alipay Choir made this informative video
about Ant Chain. Ant Group is a giant Chinese company which runs
Alipay, which is sort of the Chinese version of Paypal and Venmo and
Amazon and Robinhood combined.
They are very enthusiastic about Ant Chain, which is why they made
this musical video dressed in ant costumes:
