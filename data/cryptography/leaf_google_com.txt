I don't think fingerprint scanners work in a way that's obviously
amenable to hashing with "well-known" algorithms. Fingerprint scanners
produce an image, from which some features can be identified. But, not
all the same features can be extracted identically every time an image
is obtained.  I know there's been research into fuzzy hashing schemes,
but are they sufficiently secure, fast, and easy to code that they
would be workable for this?

Any actual cryptographers care to comment on this? I don't feel
qualified to judge.
