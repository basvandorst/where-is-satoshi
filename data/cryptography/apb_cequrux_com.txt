@_subject: Effective and ineffective technological measures 
The DMCA said:
What does "effectively" mean here?
If it has its plain english meaning, then one could argue that ROT13,
CSS (and anything else that can easily be broken) are *ineffective*
technological measures, so circumventing them is not prohibited by this
clause.  Distinguishing effective measures from ineffective measures
might reduce to measuring the resources required to break them.
Or does the clause really mean "No person shall circumvent a
technological measure that *purports to control* access to a work
protected under this title"?

@_subject: password-cracking by journalists... 
When I last brought this up (29 to 30 July 2001, Subject: Effective
and ineffective technological measures), people posted references to
two slightly different sections that try to define what "effectively
protects" and "effectively controls" means:
1201(b)(2)(B): a technological measure ''effectively protects a right of
    a copyright owner under this title'' if the measure, in the ordinary
    course of its operation, prevents, restricts, or otherwise limits
    the exercise of a right of a copyright owner under this title.
1201(a)(3)(B): a technological measure ''effectively controls access to
    a work'' if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation,
    requires the application of information, or a process or a
    treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to gain access
    to the work.'
The key phrase seems to be "in the ordinary course of its operation".
If you publish the fact that you use rot to protect your copyrighted
material, but keep secret the fact that n = 13, then the ordinary course
of operation of the decryption process requires the application of
this secret value, so the process "effectively controls access" and
"effectively protects".  The fact that somebody can guess the secret
value would seem to have no bearing on whether rot "effectively" does

No crypto here, just C language lawyering.
It certainly appears to be guaranteed by my reading of the c89 and c99
standards.  See below for citations.
I don't believe this, unless you have citations to sections in the
Yes, sure.
I strongly disagree. The whole point of the volatile qualifier is to
tell the compiler that external things that it doesn't know about might
read and write the value behind its back, and that the sequence of reads
and writes done by the program are important.
The c89 standard was not quite as clear as c99, but c99 says:
        Accessing a volatile object, modifying an object, modifying a
        file, or calling a function that does any of those operations are
        all side effects, which are changes in the state of the execution
        environment.  [ISO/IEC 9899:1999 section 5.1.2.2.3 paragraph 2]
        In the abstract machine, all expressions are evaluated as
        specified by the semantics. An actual implementation need
        not evaluate part of an expression if it can deduce that its
        value is not used and that no needed side effects are produced
        (including any caused by calling a function or accessing a
        volatile object).  [ISO/IEC 9899:1999 section 5.1.2.3 paragraph 3]
        An object that has volatile-qualified type may be modified
        in ways unknown to the implementation or have other unknown
        side effects.  Therefore any expression referring to such an
        object shall be evaluated strictly according to the rules of the
        abstract machine, as described in 5.1.2.3.  [ISO/IEC 9899:1999
        section 6.7.3 paragraph 6]
Section 5.1.2.3 gives implementations permission to optimise, but only
if no needed side effects are produced.  Section 5.1.2.2.3 says that
accessing a volatile object is a side effect.  Section 6.7.3 says that
external factors unknown to the implementation might depend on accesses
to volatile objects.  Unfortunately, I can't find a definition of a
"needed" side effect, as opposed to an un-needed side effect, but I
think the overall intent is clear, and I think that the parenthetical
phrase in section 5.1.2.3 implies that accessing a volatile object is
a "needed" side effect.
The C++ standard makes the intended meanting of the volatile qualifier
even more clear by adding words like "The observable behavior of the
abstract machine is its sequence of reads and writes to volatile data
and calls to library I/O functions."  [ISO/IEC 14882:1998 section 1.9
paragraph 6]
An interesting argument.  But I claim that there's no way for an
implementation to know whether the program is running/will run in
emulated hardware rather than real hardware, nor whether or not a logic
alalyser is/will be attached to the bus.  Logic analysers and hardware
emulators would allow the accesses to volatile storage to be observed,
and the implementation would have to ensure that the observations
matched the behaviour intended by (the orthodox interpretation of) the
volatile qualifier.
True.  But any compiler that tried to use such arguments to weasel out
of the requirement to handle volatile in the expected way would become
Declaring the buffer as volatile would remove the compiler's licence to
do such optimisation.

A bank once told me that it was impossible for them to convert from an
unintelligible name on a credit card statement into any other kind of
name whatsoever (and certainly not into an end-user-familiar name),
and impossible for them to show me a copy of any document whatsoever
that might be related to the charge; however, they said that if I
repudiated the charge, then they could get a copy of the voucher
or other documents.  So I repudiated the charge, but the bank was
still unable or unwilling to show me the promised copies of relevant
documents.  The merchant eventually contacted me about the repudiated

@_subject: "Verified by VISA" looks phishy 
I tried to renew a domain name registration and pay by credit card,
and encountered a nasty problem with (some implementations of?) a
service called "Verified by VISA", which is nominally intended to secure
Internet credit card transactions.
The domain name registrar asked what domains I wanted to renew, and
redirected my browser to a third party credit card payment service.  So
far so good: the domain name registrar told me "you will be redirected
to ${PAYMENT_SERVICE}."
The payment service confirmed the amount to be paid, asked
for my credit card number and a few other details, and told
me that I would be redirected to my bank to confirm my PIN
number.  But I was not redirected to my bank, I was redirected to
The bankserv.co.za web site claimed to be part of a system called
"Verified by VISA", and asked me for the PIN that I use for ATM
transactions with my credit card.
The problems with this include:
  1) Locating the verification web site at a domain name not associated
     with the bank looks phishy.
  2) Telling customers not to worry about (1) trains them to be more
     vulnerable to phishing.
  3) Providing both the ATM PIN and the card number to the verification
     web site enables fraud by insiders, is possibly a violation of the
     cardholder's contractual requirement to keep the PIN secret, and is
     a violation of the ordinary prudent desire to keep the PIN secret.
  4) Telling customers not to worry about (3) trains them to take less
     good care of their PIN.
I phoned my bank, and talked to somebody who could not understand
the problem: "See the lock icon?  That means its secure."  I have
subsequently tried to explain the problem to the bank via email.  I
asked them to: use the bank's domain name, not bankserv.co.za; use a
unique PIN instead of re-using the ATM PIN; use one time passwords
instead of PINs.  I haven't had a response to my suggestions.
