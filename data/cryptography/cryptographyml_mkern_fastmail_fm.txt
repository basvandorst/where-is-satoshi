Aside from the user experience, client SSL certificates are also bad for
the user from a privacy point of view. They uniquely identify the user
to a passive network adversary which leaks a lot of information about
the user's location and habits. Authenticating the user at the
application layer once a secure connection has been established avoids
this problem.
An example of an application suffering from this issue is tresorit [1],
[2]. They offer a Dropbox like service with client side encryption. A
client SSL certificate is created for the user during sign up which
contains the user's full name and email address. This certificate is
used to connect to the server and keep files in sync whenever the user's
machine is turned on or they use the mobile app. A global passive
adversary can use this to trivially identify the user and link all their
other traffic to them.
