@_subject: [Cryptography] Plug and Charge and Cryptography (ISO 15118) 
Hello Folks,
the amount of Electrical Vehicle (EV) will increase in the next few years.
The global community of car manufactures has written together a standard
called ISO 15118 which deals about "Plug and Charge" and "Vehicle to
Grid" communication.
This standard also describes the billing when charging an EV.
I've read a little bit in the standard and it seems that they think a
lot about cryptography and security.
Whats your opinion about it?
