@_subject: secure phone (was Re: Starium...) 
i'm not sure i get this.  it seems to me that a small "doodad" with a
female jack and a three inch cord with a male connector on it would be
better.  it wouldn't force the "user" to provide a second phone cord
in order for the doodad to be used.  you could then connect it between
the handset and the handset cord, between the handset cord and the
base, or between the base and the wall.  no?

@_subject: Thermal Imaging Decision Applicable to TEMPEST? 
off the top of my head, i'd have to say that anyone *intelligent*
would be able to see that this is simply "different equipment for
seeng things that are in a different part of the electromagnetic
telescopes are for seeing visual light through things that permit it
(windows and doors).
thermal imaging equipment is for seeing "heat" through things that
permit it (walls, etc).

just for fun, let's suppose that your anonymous publication was a fine
description of how to factor really large numbers in trivial time (and
you really don't want every large intelligence agency and their
bastard children coming after you).
how would you sign that?  after all, your paper would effectively be a
description of how to sign anything with anyone's public key.
[Use an HMAC and a secret only you know, then, or some similar
mechanism. If your new method destroys both public key methods and
hash functions at the same time, you'll need to be more creative --Perry]

@_subject: Field slide attacks and how to avoid them. 
so change that to
 (username, expiration) -> MAC signature
 ---------------------     --------------------------
 (Alice, 21-Apr-2001    -> MAC (MAC(Alice), MAC(21-Apr-2001), key)
 (Alice2, 1-Apr-2001    -> MAC (MAC(Alice2), MAC(1-Apr-2001), key)
