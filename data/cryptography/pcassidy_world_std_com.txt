What the Chinese need to do is redefine their national firewall as a
content control and protection strategy under the DMCA. Then they could
get the RIAA to lobby Justice to indict the CIA. If it works, RIAA could
contract with the Chinese Army to enforce copyright the way the oil
companies use mercenary armies to protect working wells and land leases in
Latin America. Win-win.
