I have immensely enjoyed the historical account 'Crypto' by Steven Levy.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Super-computer project wanted 
Marc Stevens ( CWI, Amsterdam, NL) is working on SHA-1 collisions. He has yet to generate one, but as I understand it, the only thing lacking right now is enough computing power.
Generating such a collision is significant from a practitioner viewpoint. Without a concrete example, tales of weaknesses in SHA-1 will be brushed off as 'merely theoretical'. The hashclash project ( for example, was instrumental in convincing people to stop using MD5. Incidentally, Marc was involved in that project as well.

@_subject: [Cryptography] On the deployment of client-side certs 
In today's threat models, there is also the metadata angle to consider. Client certificates are exchanged before the TLS connection is encrypted. Therefore, any information in the client certificate is sent in the clear. For server-to-server, this may be acceptable, but for regular clients: no. In this sense, client certificates are a definite step back from the web-based authentication to which we have become accustomed.
