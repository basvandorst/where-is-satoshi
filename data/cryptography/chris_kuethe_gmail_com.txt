There's the ever popular wireless security gateway.
Assume you have a mixed population of users on the wireless, some of
whom are trustworthy, some are evil. Some are Admin users, some are
guests. Some are wizards, some are clueless. All of them want to "do
their thing on the wireless."
Keeping in mind all the fun attacks you can use on a wireless net, how
would you go about making network access secure (available, private,
reliable, accountable, controlled) enough and yet be usable to the
average doofus? Enumerate the risks, specific exposures, available
attacks and countermeasures.
I've done it, and it's not hugely hard to do or use.
Think back to the days of thin-net (etc.) where ethernet really was a
broadcast medium. Back then, it was radio over coax, not radio over
air. Many of the same issues still apply. But it's easier to get
802.11 gear these days than it is to get 10b2....

Or someone is trying to slip messages past bayesian filters trained to
allow pgp messages. Most of these spams are awarded insanely high spam
scores by spamassassin.
I've been getting spam with blocks of text strongly resembling pgp
signatures appended for years now. Got about 250 of them last year.
And, amusingly enough, they seem to keep up on their patches (the
versions of pgp seem to keep up with the official releases). Still,
the signatures would never verify, as there were invalid base64
characters in the signature block.

You just know that people won't want to totally reboot their machines
every time they want to bank, because that'll break their
excel+quicken+msmoney integrated finances. So they try make a bootable
HD partition, or run it under vmware, or copy the "trusted" client
off. These of course cannot be allowed by the banks if they want to
preserve the illusion of their secure banking app...
And now we have a market for cracked "trusted" banking clients, both
for phishers and lazy people... it's game copy protection wars all

Never underestimate people's shortsightedness and laziness as
motivation to defeat a security system. Sort of how laziness is a
virtue of perl programmers.
Well, software distribution can be outsourced to AOL. :)
I hate it when people say stuff like this, but: "I'm no hardware
engineer, but it shouldn't be that hard to build something like a
selfcontained POS pin-pad about the size of a calculator..." And as I
was snickering while I wrote that, I was trying to enumerate all the
hard parts - things like a tamper-resistant case, software that wasn't
going to be leaking key bits, etc.
The latter will be easy to achieve if you can make inexpensive,
robust, reliable, tamper-resistant, failsafe, userfriendly hardware.
In short, it's 2-factor authentication. Knowing your PIN, and having
your personal ATM appliance.

He didn't say that AES is snake oil. He says he wants assurance that
the tool operates correctly. Using AES to generate an XOR key is still
using AES, but it's using it poorly.
He didn't say that closed source is snake oil. He says he wants
assurance that the tool operates correctly. The kind of assurance you
get from having a completely open design and implementation.
This is right up there with Seagate's encrypting disk which Dave Korn
(rightfully) expressed dismay over...
"And the reason is that software vendors, particularity software
vendors in the security world need to have some place to hide their
secrets. And we provide the perfect place to hide secrets, because we
can cryptographically handle things in a way that makes very difficult
to snoop or sniff the secrets. We have hidden operation in the drive
as well as hidden storage place that normally can't be accessed via
ATA commands. So in a way we have a bit of a black box, in terms of a
security device, that no one knows what is going on in there, and it
is a perfect place to hide stuff."
That's just wrong on so many levels. I want to know exactly how my
data is being transformed and stored. I want to be absolutely sure
that the on-disk representation of my data is critically dependent on
my key, and not on some vendor-derived key based on my disk serial
number. I want to know for sure that reading sector -42 won't hand you
back my key. I want to know that my encryption software isn't somehow
leaking my key. etc.
Hand me a crypto tool so well designed, so carefully audited and so
rigourously proven that it's approved for storing the government
secrets until the end of time... I'll still say "that's nice, where's
my copy of the source code".

(curse you anti-gmail-top-posting zealots...)
Yep. For fun I wrote a custom firmware for the Sparkfun Geiger counter to

There are heaps of them at big-box retailers in the US, with no sign of
going away. I got a couple for $5 each.
Low activity sources seem to be fairly unencumbered. There are plenty of
places that will sell calibrated test sources or lumps of random ore for
educational use. Then you get to tell people funny stories about the time
you bought radioactive material on the internet, and someone else gets to
do the compliance paperwork (if necessary).
Homebrew geiger counter rigs aren't exactly practical or scalable - I don't
want to make my datacenter guys cut open a case of smoke detectors and
solder a dozen GM tubes so we can have good random numbers. A better
solution might be to use one of the various thumb-drive sized AVR-USB
boards: load in a simple firmware to emulate a serial port, and emit
samples from the onboard ADCs and RC oscillators... no soldering required.
I was going to say that it's simple to inspect the code - even the
generated assembly or the raw hex - for undesired behavior, then I
remembered the USB side is non-trivial. If you're not using the onboard USB
hardware it's much easier to verify that you're only doing an ADC sample, a
timer read, a couple of comparisons, a UART write, and nothing else
(assuming you offload the whitening to your host's entropy pool).
