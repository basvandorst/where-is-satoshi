@_subject: [Cryptography] Advice and feedback on our crypto software audits 
Good Morning Crypto and Privacy Enthusiasts,
[X-posted to randombit, metzdowd and liberation-tech]
I'd like to solicit feedback from the crypto/privacy community on development procedures for bringing a new cryptography product to market in a responsible manner with sufficient review and vetting of its design and security claims.
The product ( Crypton,  ) is open source (AGPL) and a high level 'secure-by-default' framework for building collaborative multi user applications. Naturally, this is a web framework, but deployment is currently recommended for HTML5 mobile apps and browser Here's the first part of the story about how we've approached  security auditing so far.  I'm curious if there are more efficient ways to leverage the security review budget.
Thanks in advance,
David Dahl
Crypton Director, SpiderOak
