What we really need is something similar to the built-in "remember
my password" functionality of current web browsers: the browser keeps
track of a login/password/certified (ie TLS certificate-backed) DNS name
tuple, and if it ever spots the user entering said login/password into a
different website, brings up some form of dialog alerting the user to a
potential phishing attack.
The downside, of course, is that:
a) It wouldn't handle password changing,
b) Some people use the same login and password *everywhere*,
c) Once you change browsers or computers, all bets are off (because the
new browser doesn't know anything about which passwords you use where).
