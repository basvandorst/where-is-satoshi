Imagine it's 2020:  as you and your family ride by the one remaining

  containers not evident to an intruder. You can simply create
  another (hidden) container inside already existing (shell)
  container. Data stored inside shell and hidden containers
  can be completely different, passwords for the containers
  are also different, and it is not possible to determine
  whether the shell container has a hidden container inside
  it, or not. Version 7 help documentation contains detailed
  information on the creation and management of hidden
  containers."
