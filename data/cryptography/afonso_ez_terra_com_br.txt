@_subject: Proving the randomness of a random number generator? 
Well, you just can't prove a PRNG is secure. It would be like proving that the AES is secure, or that factoring integers is hard. It just can't be done (aside theoretical discutions about P=NP). What you can do, at most, is show that it has the same strength than a known difficult problem. A PRNG  using AES as central core, and correctly designed, can be shown to be as strong as AES itself. Or you can use a hard problem like discrete logarithm to construct one that carries on the same difficulty for predictability. I think, under the reasonable assumption that they know what they are asking, your best approach world be to show that breaking it is as hard as some other problem, and that depends exactly on how the PRNG was designed. If it's just a bunch of XOR and S-Boxes or if it is something like a Linear Feedback Shift Register PRNG, I think you can't do it.
