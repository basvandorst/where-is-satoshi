@_subject: NSA tapping undersea fibers? 
60's Bell System officials who said exactly the same thing about the
open unencrypted microwave radio telephone links of that era.   Both
those microwave links and the undersea fibers contain highly structured
and organized information streams - individual voice channels, T1s, T3s,
IP streams, wideband data circuits are not at all difficult to extract
from the composite traffic and mapping the layout of the whole river of
information is by no means overwhelmingly difficult (and might be aided
by quiet help from the carriers or individual employees of the
carriers).  And the mapping tends to be pretty static over time, or at
least to change in predictable ways.  Finding and recording the most
interesting circuits is by no means an insurmountable task - nor is
filtering out most of the stuff that isn't interesting.   The only hard
problem is if the NSA insists on groveling through absolutely everything
sent, but this is true of their problem in general these days and not
just special to undersea cables.   And clearly the right undersea cables
contain an awful lot of useful stuff if you are the NSA... low gigabytes a second is not that difficult either (most current
undersea cable systems only transmit between 2.5 and 20 gigabits a
second or so).   IO bandwidths in large fast servers are of this order
or more these days... in the WSJ article is how the real time time critical intercepts get
from a submarine hiding in stealth 1200 feet under the ocean to Fort
Meade and then to policy makers.  Some fraction of the traffic is still
interesting after weeks or months when tapes or disks can be flown back
to Fort Meade but much more of it is only useful if it is available
within seconds or minutes during a crisis and not weeks or months later.
  Traditional microwave radio and satellite intercepts get back to Fort
Meade or the RSOCs in milliseconds but as more and more traffic flows
through cables that can only be tapped by hiding billion dollar nuclear
submarines a lot of the timeliness of NSA operations goes away.
undersea cables in the 70s allegedly involved hooking up a nuclear
radioisotope powered pod with tape recorders in it that was left in
place for almost a year between submarine visits to recover the tapes -
this would be rather hard to do with the gigabytes per second flowing
through a modern fiber cable - there is no (unclassified) recording
technology with anything like the storage capacity to record everything
or even a significant fraction of everything for that long a period in a
form factor that would fit in a pod on the sea floor.
intelligence community considered  running their own fiber cable to the
tap site on the Soviet analog cables to recover the data in real time -
I imagine that the same thing has been considered as a solution to the
current problem of recovering data from undersea fiber taps while it
is still fresh enough to be useful.  But in general it is a harder problem
than actually tapping the cable or dealing with the rivers of data it

understanding that at least some NSA satellite telemetry encoders have
built in EEROM'd keys rather than keys loaded into volatile memory that
would be erased on power down.   This is certainly  consistent with the
mission - allowing power glitches or shutdowns to erase keys would
likely compromise the ability to encrypt  data and voice and network
communications from the shuttle at a possibly critical time even if a
procedure for key loading in flight by the astronauts was provided.
valid keys if they survived reentry - and if the keys were in a chip in
EEROM or EPROM even if the box was badly damaged the key might still be
keys (which might or might not be sensitive in this case), but it also
would represent a valid example of the keys that NSA generates for the
cipher which I imagine might be of interest to those analyzing it.
secure links that there are long term keys used for cryptographic spread
spectrum sequences and the like that don't get changed from mission to
mission because they are built into the satellites.  These would not
provide the primary data security, but rather access security to the
TDRSS birds.
TDRSS traffic (which includes spy satellite links) are not widely known
- especially so as regards the exact implementations.  Thus a foreign
government which fished a crypto box out of the pine forest might
indeed get something worth looking at.
like to know what exactly got exposed as knowing this would certainly be
part of a post disaster change of keys and procedures (and even
hardware) to prevent anyone in possession of the shuttle crypto
equipment from exploiting any keys or other information that was there.

or perhaps even almost all of the Ku band TDRSS relayed telemetry and TV
and a good bit of the S band relayed traffic has been encrypted.   This
was, I have been given to understand, part of the upgrades to the comms
and TV systems on the shuttle completed in the last few years which converted analog TV transmission to digital TV.

released full details of modulation, multiplexing, error correction
coding,  randomization, interleaving, frame sync formats, channel
assignments and scale factors for the data even for those links and
modes that aren't encrypted.  And actual link frequencies are but a
small part of the  data base of information one would need to
successfully intercept useful information from the shuttle links - even
1980s to early-90s era digital telemetry signals are pretty complex and
non trivial to deal with even if you know the frequency.

and there is a significant chance that at least some of the details of
the access protocols and signal formats used with these spacecraft are
classified in order to protect sensitive military links.

worse than phase lock all the video dot clock oscillators in a computer
room or office to the same master timing source. This would make it
significantly harder to recover one specific monitor's image by
averaging techniques as the interference from nearby monitors would have
exactly the same timing and would not average out as it does in the more
typical case where each monitor is driven from a video board with a
slightly different frequency dot clock (due to aging and manufacturing

manufacturers very little if it was designed in in the first place.

removing the ground on a cable shield.

FCC rules (at least for a manufacturer or dealer) it probably would
be closer to legal than deliberately creating rf interference

less as there is no serial stream of analog pixel by pixel video energy
at any point in such an environment.  Most TFTs do one entire row or
column of the display at a time in parallel which does not yield an
easily separated stream of individual pixel energy.   Thus extracting
anything resembling an image would seem very difficult.
