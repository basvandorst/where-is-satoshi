So how do you choose your notaries, and how does someone wanting to join the
network become a notary themselves?
The great thing about having a single blockchain is that there are no hurdles
to participate in the network. Mining prevents collusion without the need to
elect these special notary nodes.
What happens when a single notary is down as syncing happens between notaries?
You're not going to be able to calculate on all chains needed for the mesh, and

@_subject: [Cryptography] Cryptocurrency Exchange without a trusted third party 
It's a bit rough, but I hope it fosters some discussion. Constructive flames welcome!
  1. Alice has Altcoin, but wants Bitcoin.
  2. Bob has Bitcoin, but wants Altcoin.
How can they exchange cryptocurrencies without a trusted third party?
Protocol   1. Alice moves Altcoin to a new Altcoin address
  2. Bob moves Bitcoin to a new Bitcoin address
  3. They exchange private keys
  4. Alice now has Bitcoin, Bob now has Altcoin.
There are many problems here, but let's concern ourselves with this one - as
they both know each other's private keys, stealing can occur.
Protocol To solve the stealing problem, they should keep their private keys to
  1. Alice tells Bob her Bitcoin address
  2. Bob tells Alice his Altcoin address
  3. Alice moves Altcoin into Bob's Altcoin address
  4. Bob moves Bitcoin into Alice's Bitcoin address
  5. Alice now has Bitcoin, Bob now has Altcoin.
The problem now is that if Alice skips step 3, she gets to keep her Altcoin
and her newly aquired Bitcoin (this is essentially stealing from Bob).
Protocol What we have here (and in the above protocols) is a trust issue - Alice doesn't
trust Bob, and Bob can't trust Alice. I don't blame either of them.
Here's a way for them to build some trust between them:
  1. Alice tells Bob her Bitcoin address
  2. Bob tells Alice his Altcoin address
  3. Loop until we have exchanged the required amount
    3.1 Alice moves a little bit of Altcoin into Bob's Altcoin address
    3.2 Bob moves a little of Bitcoin into Alice's Bitcoin address
  4. Alice now has Bitcoin, Bob now has Altcoin.
At each step, they could move the same as the last iteration, or they could
increase by some function with faster growth.
The cool thing about this protocol is it can be used today between most
cryptocurrencies without modification.
The problem here is that Alice can still skip step 3. If she does this between
a big increase of the iteration function, it could lead to a significant
Protocol An alternative to building trust could be used if only there was a way of
punishing cheaters rather than rewarding them...
"Guys, it’s time for some game theory":
  1. Alice creates an Altcoin ransom transaction with a refund timeout
  2. Bob creates a Bitcoin ransom transaction with a refund timeout
  3. They exchange ransom unlock keys
  4. Proceed to Protocol If cheating is detected during stage 3 or 4, the player spends the other
player's ransom (e.g output disappears to an invalid address forever).
Protocol  can be considered a game with stages, having the following rules:
  1. We progress to Coin Exchange if and only if Co-op/Co-op was played within
     Ransom Setup. Otherwise the game exits early
  2. The Co-op/Co-op selection within Ransom Refund can only be played if and
     only if Co-op/Co-op was played within Coin Exchange.
Here's the payoff matricies:
  1. Ransom Setup
     +-------+--------+-------+
       |        |       |
       | Co-op  | Cheat |
       |        |       |
     +-------+--------+-------+

 Cheat | r, -r  | r, r  |
       |        |       |
     +-------+--------+-------+
  2. Coin Exchange
     +-------+------------+------------+
       |            |            |
       |    Co-op   |    Cheat   |
       |            |            |

 Co-op |    x, x    |   -x, 2x   |
       |            |            |
     +-------+------------+------------+
       |            |            |
 Cheat |   2x, -x   |    x, x    |
       |            |            |
     +-------+------------+------------+
  3. Ransom Refund
     +-------+--------+-------+
       |        |       |
       | Co-op  | Cheat |
       |        |       |
     +-------+--------+-------+
       |        |       |
 Co-op |  r, r  | 0, 0  |
       |        |       |

 Cheat |  0, 0  | 0, 0  |
       |        |       |
     +-------+--------+-------+
If we progress to completion, the total payoff matrix follows Stag Hunt:
     +-------+------------+------------+
       |            |            |
       |    Co-op   |    Cheat   |
       |            |            |
     +-------+------------+------------+
       |            |            |
 Co-op |    x, x    | -x-r, 2x-r |
       |            |            |
     +-------+------------+------------+
       |            |            |
 Cheat | 2x-r, -x-r |  x-r, x-r  |
       |            |            |
     +-------+------------+------------+
However unlike a usual Stag Hunt, players choose the Co-op/Co-op payoff
dominant strategy because of the credible commitment via Ransom Setup.
tl;dr: a ransom made high enough (i.e at least r > 2x) make a strong case for
players to play cooperatively.
Caveat: This assumes ideal conditions. As two cryptocurrenices move at
different speeds, there could be moments where it is too late for one player to
spend the ransom while the other player still can, thus leaving risk on the
table for one player.
Protocol The problem with Protocol  is that if Alice skips step 1, Bob loses the
ransom (luckily enough though, Alice can't steal anything). Let's fix that:
  1. Alice and Bob exchange ransom unlock keys
  2. Loop until ransoms are at least twice the size of the required funds
    2.1. Alice moves a little bit of Altcoin into an Altcoin ransom transaction with timeout
    2.2. Bob moves a little bit of Bitcoin into a Bitcoin ransom transaction with timeout
  3. Proceed to Protocol Like Protocol  we again have a game with stages, only this time Ransom Setup
is now split into a finitely repeated game. Luckily, our total payoff matrix is
the same.
Anti-caveat: As the ratcheting up of ransom transactions was done over time, so
too do the ransom transactions expirations. This effectively leaves an ever
decreasing total ransom that can be spent by only one player.
All that's needed to perform Protocol  and  is the ability to create
transactions that allow refund timeouts. Peter Todd's OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY
(BIP 65) for Bitcoin does exactly this.
As for Protocol  we can already do that today. Anyone want to trade :)

I beg to differ:
    Honey Badger is a BFT protocol that relies on Threshold Cryptography:
    "For example, the Visa processes 2,000 tx/sec on average, with a peak of
    59,000 tx/sec"
    ...
    "From Figure 6 we can see for each setting, the throughput increases as
    the number of proposed transactions increases. We achieve throughput
    exceeding 20,000 transactions per second for medium size networks of up to
    40 nodes. For a large 104 node network, we attain more than 1,500
    transactions per second. Given an infinite batch size, all network sizes
    would eventually converge to a common upper bound, limited only by
    available bandwidth.  Although the total bandwidth consumed in the network
    increases (linearly) with each additional node, the additional nodes also
    contribute additional bandwidth capacity"
And that's with the threshold holding across the entire network. You can
squeeze even more transactions out if you partition the network (think
Stellar's FBA does Quorum Slices, or even random threshold participants based
on Kademlia).

I've been thinking about this for a while now...
My entire motivation for reducing parameters to calls was because the majority
of dev shops, let alone at-home hobby projects, do not have an in-house
security team. Even less likely an in-house cryptographer.
So this *really does* put cryptography out of reach for not only junior
developers, but also experienced developers who haven't done the required
reading to stay out of danger. This would probably be the main reason why there
is so much roll-your-own out in the wild and broken code.
libsodium does an awesome job to reduce mistakes and encourage best practices,
but I think we can reduce the mental load even just a little bit more e.g by
generating the nonce inside of crypto_aead_chacha20poly1305_encrypt() and then
appending it to the ciphertext (just like it already does to the authentication
tag). The first thing crypto_aead_chacha20poly1305_decrypt() would do is strip
the nonce off the end and use it as it does now.
(another cleanup would be to remove alltogether the nsec parameter...)
Once you did this, look at the clean interface you have, especially in a
language that understands string lengths:
    my $ciphertext                  = crypto_aead_chacha20poly1305_encrypt($message, $additional_data, $key);
    my ($message, $additional_data) = crypto_aead_chacha20poly1305_decrypt($ciphertext, $key);

A concern I have is that it looks like it currently doesn't deal with forward secrecy. This is a must in 2019, especially when used for chat. Non-reputablity may be another feature that others may say is missing, but not sure how you would do this in an offline system such as yours.
1.3.5 - when switching to a new container, I would suggest the last entry in old container contain a pointer to the new one. Consider this analogously as signing your new GPG key with your old one. It will also help with your notary system so that nobody can travel back in time and point readers to a completely different container (with large amounts of data however, traversing this will be slow. Maybe consider a tree-like structure for containers rather than daisychain for performance, but this then breaks your append-only log aims though... just a thought).
1.3.6 - I'm not sure using DARE for Bitcoin works there isn't a concept of a master key used to sign and encrypt blocks. Consider Bitcoin as a public broadcast with multiple untrusted writers whereas DARE is trusted between participants.
1.3.7 - I'd consider adding my concern about the performance of traversing a daisy chain if implemented.

@_subject: [Cryptography] WebSocket masking under TLS? 
While reading the WebSocket Protocol RFC 6455, the bit on "masking" seemed a
bit smelly to me:
        5. Data Framing
    5.1. Overview
      In the WebSocket Protocol, data is transmitted using a sequence of frames.
      To avoid confusing network intermediaries (such as intercepting proxies)
      and for security reasons that are further discussed in Section 10.3, a
      client MUST mask all frames that it sends to the server (see Section 5.3
      for further details). (Note that masking is done whether or not the
      WebSocket Protocol is running over TLS.)
    5.3.  Client-to-Server Masking
      ...The masking key is a 32-bit value chosen at random by the client...
      ...The masking key needs to be unpredictable; thus, the masking key MUST
      be derived from a strong source of entropy...
      ...
      Octet i of the transformed data ("transformed-octet-i") is the XOR of
      octet i of the original data ("original-octet-i") with octet at index i
      modulo 4 of the masking key ("masking-key-octet-j"):
                        j = i MOD 4
      transformed-octet-i = original-octet-i XOR masking-key-octet-j
    10.3
Putting aside for now that the 32-bit-XOR mask would be susceptible to a
known-plaintext attack given that most WebSocket request payloads would start
with the same JSON structure, I'm curious as to what possible reasoning did they
have when still wanting to mask over TLS (again, from 5.1):
    "masking is done whether or not the WebSocket Protocol is running over TLS".

As Australia started out as a penal colony, it seems fitting to still treat us like convicts:

     of up to $50,000 and up to five years? imprisonment for declining to provide a password

general public, but mostly developers and admins. FFS, even talking to devs within a company I worked

The very people who should have cared, didn't. If they weren't swayed, how are you going to convince the
general voter to shout from the roof tops against politicians crying the Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse?
AFAIS the only way we (us Australians at least) will ever be safe from government spying is for encryption
to be built in, turned on by default, and being supply chain tamper proofed (this includes the legislation
like above). Anything away from this is either going to be too onerous on the user, or will eventually be
commandeered by governments.
A few years ago, the crowds said that the way against this push from governments to backdoor encryption was
to play their game politically rather than to try and solve it technically. History shows that this hasn't

Political solutions aren't... so let's stop playing their games.

Have a look at "How to Exchange Secrets with Oblivious Transfer", transcript at the bottom of the PDF:
  But as Schneier says:
  "This protocol allows Alice and Bob to exchange secrets simultaneously, but says nothing about the quality of the secrets exchanged"
Maybe you could add homomorphic decryption step to verify the secrets before both sides can be atomically decrypted?

Something's been bugging me recently...
For the past few years, US officials have gone on multiple world tours trying to convince counterparts to ban Huawei from their networks, with the pretext being that China can use backdoors into critical national infrastructure.
Wouldn't it be better if they designed the network and equipment to be untrusting, and deployed e2e encryption everywhere?
Pondering on this suggests that security was not their primary motive behind the bans.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Who Is the Encryption Working Group? 
Here's an article that popped up today:
From the article:
  Renwick rejected the idea that the encryption debate comes down to a choice
  between two binary opposites, however.
  He cited the comments by the "distinguished" Encryption Working Group (EWG)
  assembled by the Carnegie Endowment and Princeton University. EWG called for the
  debate to abandon two straw men.
  "These are, first, that we should stop seeking approaches to enable access to
  encrypted information, but second, that law enforcement will be unable to protect
  the public unless it can obtain access to all -- and I emphasise the word all --
  encrypted data through lawful process," Renwick said.
  As EWG wrote, "[These are] absolutist positions not actually held by serious
  participants, but sometimes used as caricatures of opponents."
The "not actually held by serious participants" is troubling. Having never heard
of the EWG, I looked them up:
  Here's an incomplete member list from their website:
          Affairs, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
          and former Senior Director for Cyber Operations, National Security
          Council, White House
          Affairs, Princeton University
          Columbia World Projects and former Deputy Director, Central Intelligence
          Agency
Apart from Ed Felten, that's a few names there I wouldn't want to be on the same ist as...
Looking at the group's "Moving the Encryption Policy Conversation Forward" article
[1], it reads like the thin end of the wedge. I found the section "Branch 4:
Focusing on Approaches That Involve Key Escrow, Rather Than Delivery of Code Updates
to a Phone" chilling:
  "As scoped so far, there are two primary ways in which law enforcement could
  theoretically gain access to a mobile phone. One of these is to develop an
  approach involving key escrow, in which copies of encryption keys are held
  securely so that, in certain circumstances, an authorized third party can access
  them. The second would be for law enforcement to ask or compel service providers
  to send a uniquely designed software update that would enable law enforcement to
  surreptitiously access data on a specific, targeted phone."
Now remember... this is an organisation called the *Encryption* Working Group
brainstorming how to sidestep encryption?! I feel like they need to rebrand.
Is the EWG, at all, representative of the cryptography and computer security
community (i.e "serious participants"), rather than the feeling I get that they're
a think tank backed by law enforcement trying to gain mindshare when articles refer
to them as "distinguished"?
PS: I also wanted to raise this as a comment on the article, but it looks like
Stilgherrian (I'm guessing also a member of EWG given that he writes for them as
stated in the article) banned me for asking the following in the comments:
  As far as I can tell, Dr James Renwick CSC SC is not an Ombudsman in line with the
  definition of "Ombudsman" within the Ombudsman Act of 1976.
  Given "ASIO gave him access to all documents", it would be interesting to see if there
  was a breach of "317ZF Unauthorised disclosure of information"[2].

@_subject: [Cryptography] IPsec DH parameters, other flaws 
All these war stories are great to finally be open and to a larger audience. Thanks everyone for adding their nuggets!
So it's 2020 and we now know that there's a concerted effort to actively sabotage standards and implementations by many actors (including large budgets to sway people at all levels). Considering a clean slate for the whole stack - from TCP, IP, BGP, DNS, HTTP, etc and all the way to certificate infrastructure, application layer authentication, key management etc:
  - how would you design the state of the art with security as one of its primary goals (i.e features and anti-features)
  - how would you manage the coordination differently (given the current way is prone to sabotage)
... and could these better systems be easily retrofitted on top of the current Internet (e.g Tor vs HTTP, WireGuard vs IPSec)?

For those in America, they may want to have a look at the
   Highlights include (emphasis mine):
   Once a warrant is obtained, the bill would *require* device
   manufacturers and service providers to assist law enforcement
   with accessing encrypted data if assistance would aid in the
   execution of the warrant.
This seems be following the same steps Australia took to legalising
the commandeering of companies. Feels like they finally found a way
to side-step any First Amendment argument of banning the use of
   Directs the Attorney General to create a prize competition to
   award participants who create a lawful access solution in an
   encrypted environment, while maximizing privacy and security.
... seems easier to solve one of the Millennium Prize Problems tbh.

My Twitter account ( got de-platformed (account suspended), and when asked why, they said they weren't going to tell me and said not to ask again. I did take a few backups, but after being de-platformed, although I could log in and see my feed (for a while but then they eventually purged my following list too), I *could not* perform another backup as that was one of the actions blocked too (luckily it's all still on the Wayback Machine).
