It is true that broadband isn't viable if it requires a high-bandwidth
from one source to every end user; the stream has to be exploded at
some replication points near the viewers.  But that replication
doesn't have to be done by the routers; it can also happen at a
distributed network of servers, which can be intelligent enough to add
watermarking at a cost on the same order of the cost to provide SSL.
This sort of server-based multicasting is widely deployed today by
Akamai and others, and has been far more successful than router-based

I am not sure that it is accurate to say that the world economy will
grind to a halt without encryption.  It would suffer massive truly
fraud losses, just as credit cards currently experience massive fraud
due to their use of a single fixed account number.  But given the
current mood in the US, the public might even be prepared to accept
huge economic losses -- if it made them feel safer.
An effective argument against crypto restrictions must be on the
grounds that new laws would not help fight terrorism.  It is very
difficult to convince people with a cost-side argument, because the
effects of a successful terrorist attack can be viewed as nearly
infinite.  The public will only be strongly opposed to new measures if
they feel that they are ineffective.

At least in Washington, DC, Fedex already requires an ID before

It is not possible to use the drop boxes anonymously, because you must
give an account number or credit card number as payment.

For books and CDs -- and as the region coding system breaks down,
increasingly for DVDs as well -- only shipping costs and market
illiquidity protect the segmentation.  And markets are becoming more
liquid, even at the consumer level.  For example, I routinely order
the European editions of books from amazon.co.uk, for example, instead
of waiting for them to be published in the US.  This is exactly as
easy as buying from amazon.com; they even accept the same login.

Actually, he does; slide 11 is titled "Why has SSL succeeded?",
and slide 23 is titled "The WEP Debacle".  Also, although speakers
often do nothing more than read what's on the screen, a talk does
ideally involve more content than is on the slides.
I would agree that HTTPS has been more successful than WEP, in the
sense of providing defense against real threats.  HTTPS actually
defends against some real attacks, providing an effective answer to a
clearly defined problem: preventing the exposure of sensitive
information such as credit card numbers, even in the face of
eavesdropping and server impersonation.  This is only one threat model
and maybe not the most realistic one, but HTTPS does define it and
address it.  Meanwhile, WEP is too weak to prevent any attacks; and
even if it were not cryptographically weak, its stone-age key
management would make it a poor tool for any network with more than a
handful of users.
A very relevant question is why WEP has been so much more widely
deployed than HTTPS.  Eric Rescorla is correct that people choose
whether to use security measures or not based mostly on how convenient
they are, not on how much they need them.  In this sense, HTTPS is a
failure; although it is effective, it is so difficult to use that
almost no one bothers unless credit card numbers are involved.
Security needs to be easy, or people will just put up with losses instead.
In fact, early versions of both SSL and SSH had extensive flaws; it
took many people to evolve them into their present states.  *All*
security protocols have low survivability ratings.  Inventing a new
protocol is extremely hazardous.

There are two needs a security protocol can address.  One is the need
to prevent or mitigate real attacks; the other is to make people feel
less afraid.
HTTPS might or might not have addressed a major problem, but it did
address a major fear.  Many people -- not only consumers, but also
merchants, issuing banks, and processing companies -- were concerned
about using credit card numbers on the Internet in 1995, when there
was no viable way to buy anything online.  Netscape designed an
effective protocol, deployed it widely, and made it visible to
end-users.  It offered a credible promise that you could trust your
session without trusting the network, and that's what made people
willing to do large-scale online commerce and banking.  This is not
to be underestimated.
At the same time, Netscape put visible crypto into the hands of people
who had never used crypto before, and in many cases had never even
owned a computer before.  This did a great deal to counter the
rhetoric about encryption being a tool for drug dealers and child
The physical security industry has known for a long time that if you
want something deployed, you shouldn't be looking at what problems are
interesting or even at what problems people actually have.  You should
be looking at what makes people afraid.  Fear drives deployment.
