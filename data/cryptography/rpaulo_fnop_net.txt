@_subject: 128 bit number T-shirt? 
At Tue, 01 May 2007 20:59:42 -0400,
I'm not sure if you're the one who made it, but can you make a black
version too, please ?
I would buy it, for sure.
P.S.: This is not because I'm a metalhead, just because I like black
tshirts... ;-)

@_subject: USB drive manufacturer encrypts data with XOR 
From "The specifications of the 2.5in. Easy Nova Data Box PRO-25UE RFID  hard drive case by German vendor Drecom sound promising: hardware data  encryption with 128-bit AES, access control via an RFID chip compact  enough to carry around on your key ring and optional 160GB or 250GB  hard disk capacity. Swiping the RFID chip along the case causes the  integrated Innmax IM7206 crypto controller to reveal the drive as a  USB 2.0 mass storage compatible device to the attached computer. This  works under Linux and Mac OS X as well as Windows.
These regular repetitions continued, and the almost identical columns  of numbers suggest that the 512-byte sectors of your drive are not in  fact encrypted with AES, but merely with a constant 512-byte cipher  block applied as an XOR (exclusive OR)."
