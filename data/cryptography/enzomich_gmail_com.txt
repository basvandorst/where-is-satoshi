Well, not really: the buddies on the list can be located through a
Distributed Hash Table such as Kademlia, and, once their IP addresses are
known, their presence can be checked by ping/pong exchange of UDP packets
every few seconds. The biggest problem is represented by NATs, but there
are techniques that can alleviate it (hole punching or, in stubborn cases,
relaying through non-NATted nodes).
Why not get OTR then?
