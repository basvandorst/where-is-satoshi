Please note the following follow-up message on cypherpunks from
Ian Goldberg:
In article <00e101c1d2d8$c9768080$c33a080a at LUCKYVAIO>,
I'd just like to credit the "O(minutes)" calculation to Nicko;
my own opinion was that:
- We have no reason to believe the asymptotic result applies to "real"
  keylengths (2^1024 <<< infinity)
- The physical properties of such a machine (size, power, cooling, etc.)
  seem implausible to me.
I personally don't intend to be revoking my 1024 bit key at this time.

Ed writes claiming this speculation about Palladium's implicatoins is
I think you misunderstand the technical basis for this claim.  The
point is Palladium would allow Microsoft to publish a file format and
yet still control compatibility via software certification and
certification on content of the software vendor who's software created
Your other claims about the limited implications for whistle-blowing
(or file trading of movies and mp3s) I agree with.
