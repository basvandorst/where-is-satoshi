In Hong Kong a lot of people do little more than wave their bags at the
turnstile.  Removing the wallet and revealing its size is unnecessary.

You're quite correct Matt,
Which is why IMHO you can only really get true "non-repudiation" through use
of PKI.  And more specifically:
- where the key pair was generated by the end-user, and
- where the server has stored a copy of the transaction - digitally signed
by the end user - which it can reproduce in court.  In this case, a corrupt operator could not have faked the transaction even
if they had wanted to. RSA SecureID and OATH technology have some great virtues:
- they cost nothing to integrate at the client end - there is no client
"footprint" so there's nothing to go wrong
- they are relatively easy to understand and use
- they're unquestionably better than reliance on user IDs and passwords.
What they won't do is:
- provide non-repudiation
- defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, or
- provide a robust defence against phishing scams
And for these reasons I suspect their days are numbered.
All the best,
