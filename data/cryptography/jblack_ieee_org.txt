After reading through the white paper, it would seem this could be of some use, for IMs and other non-persistent messages. But, if you need to store something for 10 yrs, recovering the key could be problematic.
  The other problem I have is that it would appear you have to buy their software for the key generation, so it will be less useful, unless all of that is included in their development kit, where we can create our own key generation/storage systems.
  Has IBE been evaluated to see how secure the basic theory is?
