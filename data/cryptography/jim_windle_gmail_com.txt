"Seth Polansky, Cellcrypt's vice president for North America, disputes the
idea that building technology to allow wiretapping is a security risk.
"It's only creating a weakness for government agencies," he says. "Just
because a government access option exists, it doesn't mean other companies
can access it." "

This was new. Other countries have spied on American companies, and they
have stolen from them, but this is likely the first time?occurring months
before the late November attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment (SNE
)?that a foreign player simply sought to destroy American corporate
infrastructure on such a scale. Both hacks may represent the beginning of a
geopolitically confusing, and potentially devastating, phase of digital

Malware masquerading as Microsoft code penetrate an western European
national telco.
"It was in the summer of 2012 that the anomalies were initially detected by
employees at Belgium?s largest telecommunications provider, Belgacom. But
it wasn?t until a year later, in June 2013, that the company?s security
experts were able to figure out what was going on. The computer systems of
Belgacom had been infected with a highly sophisticated malware, and it was
disguising itself as legitimate Microsoft software while quietly stealing

Interesting proposal for a quantum sneakernet as an admittedly slow
alternative to submarine cables which won't support entanglement.
Entangled photons are carried in specially modified cargo containers which
are then moved via existing transportation infrastructure.  Technology
