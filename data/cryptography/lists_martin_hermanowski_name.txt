There is a great risk of data loss if the TPM protection is badly
implemented. You can, however, store an encrypted key in your (not
encrypted) hard disk, and save the decryption key both inside the TPM
(bound to valid bios/boot loader/Kernel/OS PCR values) *and* in a second
place for emergency recovery (like a memory stick in a safe).
This way, the data on the hard disk can only be decrypted, if the
unaltered operating system is used - the TPM will not decrypt the bound
data if the system state changed. Of course, after reflashing your bios,
you need to use your second key credential (once).
