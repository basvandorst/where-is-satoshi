@_subject: refactoring crypto handshakes (SSL in 3 easy steps) 
The "extra messages" might be irrelevant for cryptography,
but they're not irrelevant for security or functionality.
E.g. in SSL, you have capability/feature negotiation
(cipher suites, trusted CAs, in TLS 1.2 also signature
algorithms, etc.) which IMHO *is* important for security (if you consider the security implications of deploying this over tens of years and hundreds of millions of hosts).
(But yes, there are variations of SSL where a smaller number of RTTs might have been sufficient..)
Best regards,

There's a dependency from "negotiated capabililities"
to the cryptographic things included in the first message
from client to server (since e.g. what algorithm is used by the client, or even what certificate is selected,
depends on these "non-crypto" capability/feature parts.)
But as James pointed out, you could probably handle this in "optimistic" mode; i.e. make a guess what the "negotiated
capabilities" are likely to be, and fall back to more
RTTs if the guess is wrong.
(BTW, usually we also want the capability negotiation
to be secure; SSL simply exchanges MACs of all messages
once the key for MAC has been agreed on. Would this
add 0.5 or 1RTT? Or perhaps there's some clever
way to do it without additional RTT?)
Best regards,
