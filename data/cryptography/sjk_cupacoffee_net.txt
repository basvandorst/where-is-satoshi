@_subject: more reports of terrorist steganography 
This struck me oddly as well. I cannot think of a single significant
Internet attack which has been traced to any terrorist organizations. I
would agree that this article seems to be designed to alarm rather than
inform, and, no doubt, pick up a government contract.
Additionally, the author seems to make a big deal about asymmetric
encryption without considering how key exchange is accomplished. The
logistics of key exchange remains one of the vulnerabilities any
asymmetric encryption system.

@_subject: SSL/TLS and port 587 
Perhaps you'd like to expand upon this a bit. I am a bit confused by your assertion. tcp/587 is the standard authenticated submission port, while tcp/465 is the normal smtp/ssl port - of course one could run any mix of one or the other on either port. Are you suggesting that some postmasters/admins are claiming that their Submission ports are encrypted?
