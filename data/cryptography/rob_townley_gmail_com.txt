Almost every U.S.A. based bank that i have used own several physical
branch locations.  Maybe
your country is different.  Disable the service until the customer
physically brings in the old hardware to be replaced with a new one to
eliminate need for remote management.  Our planet has too much
electronic garbage to build permanent preprogrammed death.
