Yes. And it will not happen. The cost and hassle of introducing such a
system will be so high that it wouldn't make sense financially, at
least not in the foreseeable future. The banks and other credit card
issuers accept that there are some losses they will have, they try to
minimise/control them and offload a portion of the remaining risk to
cardholders, merchants and insurance companies. The world is perfect

May we see the back of that envelope? Upgrade to EMV (chip & PIN) here
in UK reportedly costs around 1.1 billion pounds (around $1.9
billion), and that is simply an upgrade to the existing infrastructure
and only in a single country. To fundamentally change the system would
require tens of billions and a concerted effort of banks, the
associations and the merchants, with all the associated hidden agendas
and underwater currents. It would be too big an undertaking with an
uncomfortable C/B ratio, whereas $788m in losses is not that bad
keeping in mind the amounts involved...
