A significant subset of OpenSSL being renovated in Rust:
X.509 certificate validation in the pure Rust (no `unsafe`), on top of *ring*:

The beginnings of a C ABI for *ring*:
An example of Python bindings to the small subset *ring* exposed by the C ABI:
Patches welcome.

Firefox will do certificate validation in parallel with the
ClientKeyExchange computations. That is, the certificate path building,
certificate signature verification, and other certificate stuff is all done
in one thread, while the (EC)DHE keygen, (EC)DHE agreement, signature
verification of the ServerKeyExchange message, handshake transcript
hashing, Finished message computation, Finished message
decryption/authentication, etc. are all done in another thread. Further,
Firefox sends/receives the handshake messages concurrently with certificate
The mechanisms for applications to do this are in NSS's libssl, which is
thread-safe as far as the developers are aware. (That is, it probably isn't
