I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that America lives under the  assumption that progress does not and can not happen anywhere else.  Furthermore, other countries are forever indebted to the US for  sharing the fruits of technology that they themselves cannot develop.
Signs of this fantasy are everywhere. Whether it's export controls on  cryptography or the "exporting of Democracy", Americans think they  are the only can-do people. It's high time they woke up and realised  this is no longer, and perhaps never has been, reality.
I was reading an article regarding FreeNet and the newer peer-to-peer  file sharing systems and was struck that not a single US citizen was  represented among those interviewed -- there were Irish, Dutch, and  Japanese experts interviewed. And this was in a US paper to boot.
The mobile phone was not invented here, indeed deployment of wireless  lags about 20 years behind the rest of the world. Increasingly,  progress is taking place elsewhere and if the US wants to maintain  its fantasy, it will need a Ministry of Truth to do so.

@_subject: [Clips] Schwarzenegger signs law to punish phishing 
Uhh... how is this to be enforced? I assume that the law states that  the perpetrators will be charged, not the companies that are phished.  Concrete example may clarify:
Someone purporting to be eBay sends a note to me. I click on it,  enter my credit card number, expiration date, and other information  to make it possible to steal my identity. I'm in California. When  said identity theft is discovered, I cite this law and the fact that  I'm a victim of said "phishing". Would I recover the US$500,000 from  my credit card company, eBay, or the state government?

Would it not be easier to have the server encrypt all received messages
with one private key, at which point it would be put in the archives.
Subscribers can send their public key, which is then used to send them the
message in question in encrypted form. -- H

Why aren't certificates revoked automatically on expiration? All using a
revoked/expired certification should do is warn me that "the cert you are
using has expired/been revoked, please get a new one from foo.com". What is
the other use case I'm missing? -- H

Possibly.. the original idea was to put OpenBSD on the Raspberry Pi +
crypto software, but then we got into hardware openness wanking. I think
the current state of the art is to use a BeagleBone instead of Raspberry
Pi. -- H

Sure you can, as docx is a strict superset of plain text. I think what
you're trying to say is that you can't use Wordstar and insist on people
sending you Wordstar files when everyone else in the office is happy with
doc (or docx). -- H

This is a chicken-and-egg problem. Debian (which ubuntu is based on) will
not package b2sum until it gets traction and it won't get traction until a
distributor bundles it in their system. There actually is a bug in the
database --  --
maybe it ought to get more votes. -- H

I used
to obtain a summary of the page (the "summary:" key) and have attempted to
translate this:
After the deaths at Bataclan, detectives discovered an unencrypted mobile
in a bin. Mediapart checked this with Le Monde and it was found to be
accurate. Investigators could recover the information off iOS and certain
Android devices. At Sunday, le Figaro claimed that the bombers arrived in a
black Polo, registered in Belgium. This was the same method as the Charlie
Hebdo attackers used to get into France.
Hope that helps. -- H

Has anyone on this list contributed to   - and/or
otherwise have personal experience, caveats, recommendations with respect

For what it's worth, I use, fund, and know the guys at the EFF that are
behind it. I recommend it to all of my clients. -- H
