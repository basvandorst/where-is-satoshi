@_subject: PGPfreeware 8.0: Not so good news for crypto newcomers 
A warning about Filecrypt SDK --
A few months ago, I was doing OpenPGP interop testing between Mixmaster
and some other 2440 implementations, including PGP, GnuPG, Hushmail, and
In the course of this testing, I discovered that Zendit, which is based on
Veridis's SDK, had a rather alarming bug: it had no concept of subkey
binding signatures (it neither generated them, nor did it verify them.)
The implications here are obvious.
I didn't do any further investigation of this bug, since I found far too
many other interop/usability flaws in Zendit to justify continuing to
worry about it, and I don't know of anyone else using FileCrypt.
Consequently, I don't know if this was a Zendit-specific bug or a problem
with FileCrypt.
I notified both the Zendit and Veridis people about this problem. I
haven't heard from either if this has been fixed.

@_subject: Obituary for Janis Jagars (Disastry)  
Janis Jagars, known to many people on the Internet by his handle Disastry,
was a prolific programmer who made numerous valuable contributions to the
Internet. I am afraid I cannot do his memory justice, having known him
only a short number of years and only through his work on privacy
enhancing programs, but he earned my respect and appreciation for his
achievements in that area.
I first "met" Janis Jagars while I was employed by PGP Security. In
preparation for the release of PGP 7, I located and contacted the people
responsible for other implementations of OpenPGP, in order to set up
interop testing. Janis was working on updating the DOS-aware PGP 2.6.3i
program to work with modern implementations of PGP. His work on that
program, and his presence in the IETF OpenPGP working group, helped to
smooth over a number of PGP compatibility problems. On the PGP newsgroups
and mailing lists, Janis helped many new PGP users get started using email
encryption, and tirelessly answered support questions for privacy-related
programs. To my knowledge, Janis operated the only anonymous remailer to
exist in Latvia.
Janis was, by the original definition, a true Cypherpunk. He believed that
privacy was a right that must not be denied to Internet users, and he
wrote code to help ensure that it could not be.
When he needed a way to easily send encrypted email through Netscape, he
wrote a plugin. When he wanted a way to mount PGPdisk volumes under Linux,
he wrote a conversion tool. When Windows users wanted a pre-compiled
version GnuPG, Janis gave them one. Janis understood that the fight for
Internet privacy must take place at the hands of programmers, and he rose
to the challenge of bring useful privacy-enhancing programs into
existence, and into the hands of the public.
Immediately after the terrorist attacks in September, 2001, I took over
maintenance of the Mixmaster anonymous remailer project. Mixmaster had
been unmaintained for over a year, and needed serious work. I was
delighted when I received email from Janis, offering his help. Over the
next year, entirely of his own initiative, Janis ported Mixmaster's server
functionality to Windows, brought Mixmaster's OpenPGP support from an
unstable "alpha" state to a solid, usable feature set, and established
himself as an invaluable member of the Mixmaster development team. The
upcoming Mixmaster 3.0 release features a number of crucial improvements
which would not have happened had it not been for Janis's involvement.
My last communication with Janis was on October 11th of last year. He had
planned a vacation in Nepal, and expected to return a month later. When he
did not return, we feared the worst. Sadly, it turns out that our fears
were true: On October 31, while descending from Lobuche summit, Janis fell
250m, and did not survive.
I am dedicating this year's CodeCon conference to Janis's memory. Janis
will be missed, but his contributions will still be appreciated and
utilized. It is my hope that Janis's work will serve as an example for
other like-minded programmers, who chose to give their time and code in
the name of free speech and privacy.

@_subject: [IP] Master Key Copying Revealed (Matt Blaze of ATT Labs)  
This is a rather clever technique for discovering the second key of a
dual-keyed lock; however, it wasn't previously unknown.
I do give Matt a lot of credit for having come up with it independently,
though I think it is worth pointing out that any good locksmith would
already have been aware of this.
It was described to me in 1997, when I first started working with
locksmithing, as a way of determining a given lock's change key knowing
only the master key (and having access to the lock, but not the ability or
desire to disassemble it.) Using this to find a change key when you have a
master key isn't nearly as interesting from the point of view of an
attacker, but is the more common use of this technique in the locksmithing
The fact that AT&T couldn't find much public mention of this technique
isn't surprising. Locksmithing is a more secretive discipline than
cryptography. Locksmiths generally don't discuss the plethora of ways to
defeat standard physical security techniques with the general public.
Sometimes I think they understand the issue of threat-models better than
cryptographers do. They certainly understand that the public doesn't

If that were the case, sure. However, you usually can't know that the
master key sheer line is higher than the change key, so this doesn't work
in practice.
Note that these aren't actually direct restrictions on where the master
key sheer line is in relation to the change key sheer line, but instead
restrictions on the height difference between a given pin and the pins
adjacent to it.  This has the side-effect of limiting where the master key
sheer line is in respect to the change sheer line, because both of these
must be within the allowed distance of steps between pins.
(This is a purely physical limitation. If you had pins that were of
drastically different heights next to each other, key insertion would be
extremely difficult or impossible.)
Heck, it's possible to construct a set of all possible *keys* for a given
lock. Even with the optimizations of knowing which pin combinations are
physically impossible to use, however, this is still a lot of
Yes. A very talented locksmith could decode a pin combination on a lock
using special lock-picking tools, such as a feeler. However, in nearly all
real-world scenarios, this would not make sense. Most of the time, the
lock is not the weakest point of attack. Attacking the lock in this manner
is analogous to breaking a crypto-system by attacking the cipher. Usually,
other parts of the implementation are much weaker.
(And, in the case of a legitimate entry by a locksmith, destroying the
lock by drilling or other means would probably be cheaper than the labor
If you have a location which is secured in such a manner that the lock's
security is of concern, you should look into a lock such as Medeco, which
employs a number of security features which resist these attacks. (Angled
cuts, restricted key blanks, etc.)
(On another list, I joked that if Matt could get his technique to work on
a Medeco master-keyed system by July, I'd eat a pound of live crickets at
DEFCON.  I'll hold myself to that.)

I'm fairly certain this has been published in locksmithing journals
previously, though I would have to do some digging to prove that.
It is the prevailing opinion in the physical security space that users are
not the best qualified to judge their own threat models. Whether or not
this is correct could be up for debate, but trying to force high-security
locks on someone who doesn't need it is viewed with the same sort of
disdain that you might have for a company trying to sell Tempest-shielding
to a small business owners.
The actual lock is very rarely the point of least resistance for an
[These and other weaknesses are, in fact, addressed in a number of
high-security locks. Most users won't want to pay for them.]
Matt's paper is beneficial to fledgling locksmiths, but I'm uncertain if
it will have any effect on users. Perhaps I'm cynical.
Here's a story you might find interesting. A few years ago, a certain
employee of a Silicon Valley company with which both you and Matt may be
familiar asked me to evaluate the physical defenses of one of their
facilities. The goal was to see how close I could get to the center of the
building. They had a magnetically-sealed front door, a hand geometry
scanner on one inner door, iButton access on another, and fairly secure
physical lock cylinders.
I was able to get inside with nothing more than a coat hanger, credit
card, and a pen knife.
This is the reality of physical security. Designing a burglar-proof
installation is tricky business, and using secure locks is usually the
least of the problem. A user who needs full security should be engaging a
qualified physical security specialist to do the design and installation,
and a security professional who knows how to address all the other
potential attacks will surely be aware of key decoding techniques, and
how to defend against them.
Matt's technique is clever, and I am impressed that he came up with it on
his own. His paper is well-written, and explains a lot about master-keyed
systems in general. People interested in becoming locksmiths or entering
the physical security business will definitely want to read it.
I don't think it is going to significantly increase security in the real
world, however.

Well, unfortunately I specified "live", which probably precludes the
cooking bit. Hmm. Cricket fondue, perhaps.
That isn't necessarily the case. High-security Medecos can have multiple
valid pin rotation positions -- the pin's angled surface doesn't need to
be flush with the key. This allows much larger number of possible pin
combinations, and I think it would make your attack infeasible in practice
(particularly since the attacker presumably doesn't know if there are
dummy steps added, or if the key is part of a master-ring system. That's a
lot of work to do only to find out the attack wouldn't have worked in the
first place.)
That would certainly be true.
Have you found a source for the factory-controlled Medeco key blanks?

@_date: 2003-01-24 13:25:21
@_author: Len Sassaman 
@_subject: [IP] Master Key Copying Revealed (Matt Blaze of ATT Labs)  
Ditto. Time for a "lockpunks list? =)
I was trying to draw this in ASCII-art, and failing. Looks like Derek had
the same problem.
In any case, you'll typically find the more complex pin combinations in
installations where you need a large amount of change keys on the same
master key. It's more work to design a master-key system when you add in
these additional variables, so some locksmiths probably won't do it unless
they have to.
I'm forgetting off the top of my head how many pins a Medeco Biaxial has

@_date: 2003-01-24 17:55:08
@_author: Len Sassaman 
@_subject: [IP] Master Key Copying Revealed (Matt Blaze of ATT Labs) 
I've never encountered an automatic key combination decoder, but it would
presumably be possible to build for a lot of locks.
Most automatic lock picks are variations on the snap-gun design, however,
which is an entirely different approach to lock picking. (Think of when
you hit a cue-ball with a pool cue, and it hits the target ball. The cue
ball stops moving, and the target ball speeds off. That's the principal
behind a snap-gun: the snap-gun is the cue, the bottom pin is the
cue-ball, and the top pin is your target. You use the snap-gun to strike
all the pins at once. The top pins fly up past the sheer line, the bottom
pin stays below it, and deft use of a tension wrench lets you turn the
cylinder at just the right moment.)
I have met people who can decode a lock's pin combination by feel, so what
you are describing is almost certainly possible.
It's not exactly security-through-obscurity. The blank's cuts are known --
but in order to make blanks of your own, you have to go through a lot of
effort. It's a protection based on increasing the work an attacker needs
to do to succeed.
Now, there's another yummy idea.
Well, here's the deal. If Matt decides he really wants to see me feast on
crickets, I'll send him a box locked with a Medeco lock that has two
possible change keys (they aren't really master/change in this scenario).
I'll give him one of the change keys. If he shows up at DEFCON[*] with the
other change key, without disassembling the lock or the box, I'll publicly
"eat my words."
I'm betting my dignity on the assumption that Matt has better things to
do. :)
[*] Insects have a history of being eaten by people when The Shmoo Group
gathers at DEFCON. It's as good a place as any.

No. It's similar to arguing against a system because it uses 56 bit DES,
but missing the fact that the cryptosystem isn't actually encrypting the
plaintext at all.
There are many, many entrance techniques which do not cause any physical
damage whatsoever, which also do not require direct manipulation of the
pin tumbler mechanism.
Again, you're missing the weakest point of attack. *Ignore* the actual
lock. It doesn't matter if you have an iButton or an ASSA or a Kwikset if
the door is secured with an improperly installed spring-latch mechanism,
and it can be opened with a shim. Only after you get the rest of the
physical security aspects addressed should you spend time thinking about
the lock, because it takes a lot more time, effort, or talent to attack a
lock than it does to jimmy a latch.
I would say that 60 percent of the doors I have stood before in my life, I
could have opened with items I carry in my pocket on a daily basis.
Another ten percent would have required picking.
The world of physical security doesn't rely on "security through
obscurity." It relies on security through illusion.
Nearly all installed locks do nothing more than keep honest people honest.
I don't see this changing anytime soon.
I used to jump up and down about physical security problems when I
encountered them, until I learned that people generally don't want to hear
if they have security problems -- they just want to think they are safe.
One of my previous employers was a web hosting company, who had a locked
data center. On my second day working for them, I pointed out that I could
open the door to their datacenter with a credit card. They didn't believe
me. I demonstrated. Did they thank me for this bit of information?
Nope. I was nearly fired.
If you have to sign an NDA before you visit a company's colocation
facility, ask yourself what it is you are about to see that would do
damage to the company if you spoke about it. Locked cages? Look at the
raised floors.
None of these problems even come close to the issues of lost keys and
overly helpful employees, though. Criminals have been using social
engineering techniques to get into locked buildings for as long as there
have been locked buildings.
My comments in this thread have never been intended to criticize Matt for
publishing his paper. In fact, I hope I've praised it. I just don't think
that it will affect the status quo.

@_author: Len Sassaman 
@_subject: Keep it secret, stupid! 
I think it is worth pointing out that, while master ring systems (and
master-keyed systems with false steps added) resist the attack Matt
describes, they often make the task of picking the lock (on a case by case
basis) easier.
That needs to be considered when designing a physical security plan. One
may wish to key locks of particular importance separately from the master
ring system if entry by picking is a concern.
(There are some master-key systems, like the one made by Corbin, that
require pin rotation at the proper time to unlock the secondary sheer
line. And, as Matt mentioned, bicentric cylinders avoid this problem
completely. Cost may be a major concern with these solutions, though.)

@_subject: Keysigning @ CFP2003 
It does not. It is improper for a key-signing organizer to dictate signing
policy to individuals. When I wrote the Efficient Group Key Signing Method
paper[1], I specifically omitted identity verification steps, since it is
no one's business but the holder of the key (and those who trust that key
as an introducer) what information the holder requires before signing.
Incidentally, the GnuPG FAQ perpetuates this fallacy, so Doug is probably
not to blame for this mistake. There are better ways of determining
identity, and one of the benefits of PGP is that we aren't locked in to a
strict, rigid model of how trust is to be assigned. Convincing people that
[easily forged] government IDs are sufficient to verify identity is a
dangerous practice.
A better thing to do is to announce in the key-signing notice that
individuals may want to bring government ID in the case that someone
attending will require it to satisfy his signing policy -- rather than
dictating signing policy to your participants.

@_subject: Hypothesis: PGP backdoor (was: A security bug in PGP products?) 
The rescue of PGP from NAI's gross neglect and mismanagement of the
product line was orchestrated by individuals involved in the original PGP,
Inc. startup, and lead by respected cryptographic engineer Jon Callas
(also known for being the editor of RFC 2440) and Phil Dunkelberger (the
original PGP, Inc., CEO.) As part of their acquisition of the PGP product
line, they hired (nearly?) the entire PGP programming team, including such
familiar faces as Will Price and Hal Finney.
As a former NAI employee who worked on the PGP products, I firmly believe
the software is in far more capable hands now from a management
standpoint. As a PGP Universal user, I'm delighted by the significant
improvements in usability that the new management has allowed the
engineering team to make. The myopia of NAI's executives toward the
usability problems in PGP was one of the reasons I quit the company in
Also, for what it's worth, Phil was ousted from NAI in 2000, prior to the
discontinuation of NAI's commitment to the PGP product line, but he *is*
involved with the current PGP Corporation, as a member of the technical
advisory board.
I also have no question, personally, that if there's a backdoor in PGP,
neither Mr. Callas nor any of the PGP engineers I had the pleasure to work
with know of it. Your theory is indeed wild, and though I don't mean to
discourage vigilance in questioning these sorts of potential subversions
of integrity in software as important as PGP, you might consider doing
more research into the background of people against whom you choose to
levy hypothetical accusations in public forums in the future.

@_subject: cold boot attacks on disk encryption 
Indeed. Given the recent discussions of border searches of laptops, I
wouldn't be surprised to see this technique used against locked laptops in
suspended mode.
The idea that data in RAM doesn't automatically disappear the instant the
computer is powered off isn't the really interesting thing in this paper,
though, at least for me. I'm more intrigued by the error-correction
techniques they use to apparently recover AES keys that have degraded by
up to 10% of their bits.
It would be nice if the authors released their tools so that other
researchers can build on this.

Dear all,
[Apologies if you get multiple copies of this email.]
Mixmaster 3.0 has been released this week. This is the first major version
release since 2.9, and a continuation of that code, though it incorporates
numerous improvements, feature enhancements, and bug-fixes. It is
recommended that you upgrade your remailers to this version.
For those of you running 3.0rc1 or one of the 3.0 beta releases, the
changes are minor, though upgrading is still recommended.
Please report any problems you experience to the Mixmaster maintainers
through the bug tracker at SourceForge. (
The code can be found there as well, and is signed by the Mixmaster 3.x
release key, found on  and signed by myself and
numerous other cypherpunks. Any questions regarding tampering with the
source code should be reported as soon as noticed.
There are some user-facing improvements as well, though most of the
planned client improvements have been pushed off to 3.1. For stability
reasons, users of the client are encouraged to upgrade as well. (Users of
third-party GUIs for Mixmaster are encouraged to report their success or
problems with detailed bug reports if applicable.)
We're looking forward to your feedback!
Best regards, on behalf of the Mixmaster Development Team:
Steve Crook

is an excellent opportunity for programmers to demonstrate their work and
keep abreast of what's going on in their community.
All presentations must include working demonstrations, ideally accompanied
by source code. Presentations must be done by one of the active developers
of the code in question. We emphasize that demonstrations be of *working*
We hereby solicit papers and demonstrations.
    * Papers and proposals due: February 15, 2009
    * All Authors notified: March 1, 2009
Possible topics include, but are by no means restricted to:
    * community-based web sites - forums, weblogs, personals
    * development tools - languages, debuggers, version control
    * file sharing systems - swarming distribution, distributed search
    * security products - mail encryption, intrusion detection, firewalls
    * malware analysis - detection, compensation, and mitigation of
      emerging threats
As a new feature this year, CodeCon will be presenting a Biohack! track.
While we will continue our tradition of presenting only one talk at a
time, a portion of one of the days' talks will be reserved for interesting
biotechnology hacking projects. A key requirement for these presentations
is ease of reproduction with minimal access to expensive laboratory
Example topics include:
    * Purifying DNA using common household items
    * Developing genetically-modified bacteria in a kitchen laboratory
    * Using specially-designed software to assist in bioengineering
    * The use of simple bioengineering techniques to solve real-world
      problems.
Ideal Biohack! Track submissions will have a strong emphasis on the
"hack" portion of the talk -- in the last few years, there has been a
strong growth in the community of biology hackers; we aim to bring these
hackers together to discuss their techniques for inexpensive, at home
experimentation in biological engineering research.
Presentations will be 30 minutes long, with an additional 15 minutes
allocated for Q&A. Overruns will be truncated.
Submission details:
Submissions are being accepted immediately. Acceptance dates are
February 7th and March 1st. After the first acceptance date, submissions
