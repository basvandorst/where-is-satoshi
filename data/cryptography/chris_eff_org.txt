Does there exist an English translation (I'd be surprised if not)? If
not, I'd be happy to provide one if there were sufficient interest.

Are you saying we need to carefully surveil our government and pre-empt
it from attacking us, or that our government should carefully surveil us
and pre-empt us from attacking it?
Let's hope society as a whole never resembles life inside the Fortune
1000 too closely.

Consider the massive effort Daniel Ellsberg undertook when leaking the
Pentagon Papers.  He had to photcopy tons of stuff.  If you had a DRM'd
document that you couldn't print or email out, you could use your camera
to take a picture of the document on your computer's display.  (For

@_subject: bounded storage model - why is R organized as 2-d array? 
Right, but even though a 1.5GHz machine is a bit old (heh...) for a
workstation, my dinky little Linksys WRT54GC wireless AP still needs to
AES-encrypt a theoretical maximum of 54Mbps when I turn on WPA.
Its adorable little CPU is a far cry from a 1.5GHz Athlon. :) I haven't
tested to see if there is any difference in throughput with WPA on vs.
off, but I'd be surprised if there weren't.
Thus, something faster than AES, but still strong, would be nice. Your
point about CPU cache size vs. pad size is well-taken, though.

1. Anonymity does matter. You might have heard of a little thing called
the First Amendment. ;) It's great that you're proud of what you say,
but no matter how proud you are, there could be bad, unfair consequences
if you say certain things and/or if you have a certain identity. A
little wisely-used anonymity can further an honest debate (such as
debating what should be in the Constitution!) and protect people from
low-power groups.
2. Email signing, alone, gives you only pseudonymity.
3. I see on your site you use and advertise for CACert. I hope CACert's
signing cert(s) are never trusted by my browser, because then my browser
would trust any cheap-ass random pseudonym in the world. Which brings us
to my next point...
4. Identity is not, and can never be, a substitute for a real judgement
about goodness. That I sign my messages doesn't make them any smarter;
many good and helpful comments come from such forgeable identities as
"Steven Bellovin" and "Ben Laurie". Even fake names that look
ridiculously fake, like "StealthMonger", sometimes send useful
information. When you "immediately discount what that person says", you
are doing yourself an unfavor.
