not exactly.  they and their friends in dee cee are not able to pwn the
intenet and want to.  this is a gathering trend.
can their decades of negligence, st00pidity, and denial be turned into
enough fud that they can get the political control they desire?  likely

i bought one, of course.  we need to audit the code, and as much of
hardware as we can.  and we can develop other code for it too, which
may be fun.

not exactly.  it is the zone owners.  but yes, you can be hijacked up
the tree.  luckily this is not a problem with current CAs .
price?  the dns hierarchy at least gives you some place to complain,
though admittidely with not a lot more effect.  but with DANE, i can
take my zone and TLSA and move them to a different regiatrar for ten
the internet is not a hierarchy, a police state is.

but i am tinfoil heavy.  if my wife emails a url, i check oob to see if
she really sent it.

not a lot of peers, niche market of course.  so it would help if folk
left their seeders/senders up after downloading.

i have been pushing this water uphill for twenty years, to little
avail.  careers are built on featuritis.
was it carh who saif that there are two kinds of standards, one the
union of all the features everyone wants and the other the intersection
of those features that everyone must have?

@_subject: [Cryptography] keybase.io 
i am trying to understand keybase.io (yes, clearly i have too much free
time on my hands)
my tentative conclusion, it leverages my pgp credential to attest to
other identities, e.g. domain control, bitcoin, ...
but do you care if i control a domain or a bitcoin account?  i could pgp
sign a message attesting "my bitcoin id is ..."
what is more amusing is that the three things for which i publish
pgp signed attestation (see  are not covered
  o my OTR keys for xmpp
  o my root x.509 CA cert
  o the ssh fingerprints of critical hosts
a friend said
to the nsa, yes.  but how is it useful to the users?  e.g. i do not see
a way to leverage it to solve the "first date problem," key exchange
with a new remote friend.
clue bat, please.

you asked a question.  i made the mistake of answering.  won't do that
i think we all understand the trust structures of x.509, ssh, pgp, etc.
well, i sure hope so.

do not store critical secrets on others' systems.  period.  then, learn
how to secure your own system(s); this is seriousy hard.

i use 1pass, but only on one system, i.e. nothing traverses net.

there are a fair number of scary papers about fpga trojans.  it is very
hard to verify fabbed silicon, driving folk to desperate techniques such
as multi-fab comparison etc.
on the capability / least authority theme, i am surprised no one has
mentioned tahoe/lafs.  one can build interesting things upon it.
