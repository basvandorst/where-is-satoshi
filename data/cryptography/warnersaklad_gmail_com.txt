@_subject: [Cryptography] Decode .sgstn StenoGraph StenoNote Stenograph 
Of concern is only the raw .sgstn StenoGraph StenoNote format is released.
Not released yet is the accompanying file needed to get accurate plain
text. Article 2.3 of the City Contract provides for it but the file hasn't
been released yet.
