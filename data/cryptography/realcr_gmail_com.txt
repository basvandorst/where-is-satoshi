@_subject: [Cryptography] Practical Threshold Signatures 
Hi, I recently read the article "Threshold Signatures, Multisignatures and
Signatures Based on the Gap-Diffie-Hellman-Group Signature Scheme", written
Alexandra Boldyreva. Link can be found here:
  (Note: If you
going to read this, my question refers to the first parts of the article -
part 3 and including it.)
Does anyone here have any past experience with working implementations of
Threshold Signature mechanisms, or can point me somehow on the path to
implementing this the right way?
I will elaborate a bit about what I already know:
About Threshold Signatures:
I read a bit about Victor Shoup's idea for Threshold signatures in the
"Practical Threshold Signatures". I really liked it, though I can't put that
into use because it requires a trusted party to set up the secrets before
protocols begin. The other two options I discussed above have the following
attractive property: The secret is just a random number, not a pair of prime
numbers or any special number theoretical object. Thus it is far easier to
the secrets between the parties in the protocol in a distributed manner.
I am aware of some attempts in other articles to remove the trusted party
out of
the pre-setting of secrets in Victor Shoup's Threshold Signature, however it
seems to be very communication Expensive, much more than the actual
protocol I
want to run later. Thus I prefer not the use this schema, and I really want
make one of the former discussed schemas work.
If you happen to know about working code on this subject, or an idea about
implementing a nice one, please make sure to drop a message. I would
like to participate if you are coding something of this type.

Hey. I want to thank everyone for the helpful answers. They were very
interesting to read.
a weil pairing. (Jonathan mentioned bilinear map, I assume that means the
same thing?)
The C code for the Pairing based cryptography seems to be very useful for
this purpose.
I have two questions regarding the answers I received:
1. I feel not very smart in the domain of elliptic curves and Weil pairing.
Before jumping into the code I want to make sure I understand what I'm
doing. Do you have a recommendation of something I should read? I'm not
afraid of heavy math, though at the same time I can spend only so much time
on this.
2. Can I actually trust the elliptic curve with weil pairing to do its
cryptographic job? Maybe better asked: Can I trust it like I trust that it
is hard to factor numbers? (Maybe even more?)
I really appreciate your time reading this. Thank you for your help,

@_subject: [Cryptography] Silly Diffie-Hellman question using XOR 
Hi Stuart,
I might have overlooked something too, though I just drop here my 50 cents.
What about this protocol:
1. Alice generates a random key A, then encrypts it using B's public and
sends it to B.
2. Bob decrypts what it got from Alice, and then the shared key is
established for the rest of the conversation.
I don't have much theoretic knowledge about using Diffie Hellman, however I
think it has the advantage of being useful even when
there is no signing or authentication scheme in the background.

Hey, Sorry for posting twice, I think I have now understood what you wrote.
Let us assume that Mallory is listening to the wire.
In your proposed protocol, in step 2 Alice sends A2, so A2 is known to
Mallory. Also Bob sends B2, so B2 is known to Mallory.
In step 3, Alice sends A1 ^ A2 ^ B2. As A2 and B2 are already known to
Mallory, it means that A1 is known to mallory.
In the same way, we get that B1 will be known to mallory.
Eventually, In the end of step 3 Mallory knows A1,A2,B1,B2. Thus she could
infer every secret that might be created in step 4.

@_subject: [Cryptography] athletic event verification? 
In my opinion, if I own the measuring device, with enough effort I should
be able to cheat the sensors and make it sign over fake achievements.
My suggestion is to go for some kind of trusted social network, with
witnesses that see you achieve your athletic achievement and sign over it.
If enough friends of your friends have witnessed someone's athletic
achievement, maybe you can believe it too.
I have heard a similar question asked from a different angle: Can we create
a mobile app where you take a picture of a car that parks in a non parking
area, and it will give him a fine automatically?
How can we make sure no one can cheat the app?

@_subject: [Cryptography] Offst - A decentralized credit card 
Hi, I just published the first preview release of Offst.
Offst is a decentralized payment system based on mutual credit. It's an
open source project, written in Rust, licensed under AGPL3.
You can find the release notes and more information here:
Link to the project repository:
At this point Offst is only a bunch of command line tools, but I think some
of you can already experiment with it. Criticism and ideas are welcome!
