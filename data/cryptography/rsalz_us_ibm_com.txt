In general, it's probably a good idea to look at existing mechanisms and analyze why they're not appropriate, rather than start with a clean slate and "import" things that seem useful, especially if you don't understand the rationale.

Base64-encoded DER.  It's what the XML security standards all (W3C/IETF XML Digital Signature, W3C/IETF XML Encryption, W3C XKMS, OASIS WS-Security, etc.) all use.  XML DSIG defines a raw public key format, but nobody uses that.
I wonder what you're thinking of?  The W3C/IETF XML Encryption standard is *very* good at encrypting XML.  Were you thinking of that, and using it to do something else?

When designing computer systems, one is often faced with a choice between using a more or less powerful language for publishing information, for expressing constraints, or for solving some problem. This finding explores tradeoffs relating the choice of language to reusability of information. The "Rule of Least Power" suggests choosing the least powerful language suitable for a given purpose

In my personal experience, if you are developing a mass-market item with conventional crypto (e.g., SSL, S/MIME, etc ) then it is fairly routine to get a commodity export license which lets you sell globally.
Disclaimers abound, including that I'm not a lawyer and certainly don't speak for IBM.

I don't see how this invalidates my analogy.
In 1940 they didn't know understand about wind-induced vibration and yet it brought down the Tacoma Narrows bridge.  A few years ago we didn't know much about hash collisions, yet since then the field has brought down MD5.
If the field isn't codified, all the more reason to spread knowledge rather than encourage a priesthood.

Perhaps theoretically painful, but in practice this is not the case; commerce on the web is the counter-example. The benefits of layering for outweigh the perceived gains of just merging it all together into one glob.  For example, the ability to replace layers, or replace them by just dropping in a new library.

Developers working in almost any field should know the history and best practices -- is PGP's original "bass o matic" any more important than the code in a defibrillator? -- but this is not the way our field works right now.  Compare it to something like civil engineering or architecture.
Until we get to that point -- and we may never got there, nor want to -- it is probably better to act as mentors than, say, pricks. :)  I thought Peter's soundwave idea was kinda funny, and hopefully lessened the sting. Guus's note should recommended reading on a regular basis.
If we want to spread the use of crypto, perhaps we should be nicer to those who are also trying to do the same thing albeit poorly.

@_subject: voting by m of n digital signature? 
Yes there are a number of ways.  Usually they involve splitting the private key so that when a quorum of fragment signatures are done, they can be combined and the result verified by the public key.   Look for multi-step signing or threshold signatures, for example.
Disclaimer: I worked at CertCo who had the "best" technology in this area. It was created for SET.

The cards that I know about work differently -- you configure them to allow unattended reboot, and then no PIN is involved.  This is a little more secure, in that it requires a conscious decision to do this, as opposed to sticking the PIN somewhere on the filesystem.

Sorry, I wasn't clear enough.  When I think PIN I think of a keypad and secure channel to the HSM.  Not the name/password used by the application.  For that, of course, you're right -- the application needs it.

@_subject: Is this the first ever practically-deployed use of a threshold scheme? 
Yes, the root key for the SET consortium was done this way.  The technology was developed by Banker's Trust Electronic Commerce, which was spun off into a company called CertCo. They also had a method of re-splitting a key; think of a trade group that votes out one of the members without that entity's consent.  The code to do all that was on the HSM cards.
Both techniques are patented. CertCo failed and I don't know who ended up with the IP.  (As a souvenir from the wind-down, I have a co-branded CertCo/Chrysalis HSM. :)

A really knowledgeable net-head told me the other day that the problem with SSL/TLS is that it has too many round-trips.  In fact, the RTT costs are now more prohibitive than the crypto costs.  I was quite surprised to hear this; he was stunned to find it out.
Look at the "tlsnextprotonec" IETF draft, the Google involvement in SPDY, and perhaps this message as a jumping-off point for both: I was happy to see that the interest is in piggy-backing, not in changing         /r$

I mention Google because they are very involved and influential in Internet infrastructure, and Apple because many believe they will be dominant content delivery system, and Microsoft because they were a sponsor of the original SDSI research (
