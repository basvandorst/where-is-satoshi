[Normally I don't think that help wanteds are appropriate here, but
this one seems to have better intentions than most and the market is
bad... --Perry]
We're looking to either hire or contract with a crypto/security engineer
that can take the lead on shepherding a secure data modem through
the hoops of FIPS 140-2 with the end goal of receiving NIST validation.
The product exists and is operating.  The firmware currently provides
DES, 3DES and Skipjack encryption with SHA-1 authentication.
This code (written in C on an embedded platform) needs to be reviewed
and possibly modified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.  Documentation
needs to be developed for submittal to a NIST lab (we have a Tech Writer
in-house to support this effort).
Work will be performed in Maryland, near Gaithersburg.  Telecommuting
is not an option, sorry.
Rather than take up more list bandwidth, drop me a line for further details.

This service has been available to U.S. Government customers
for at least seven years, albeit not always with AES.  SkyTel
was keenly aware that capturing and decoding their paging
traffic was well within the means of even casual hobbyists.

Are you thinking on Ron Rivest's paper on Chaffing and Winnowing?
We were using a similar technique on satellite broadcast channels during
the 1980s and 1990s, where each of thousands of receivers would either
accept or discard individual messages from the broadcast stream based on
an (H)MAC construction.
