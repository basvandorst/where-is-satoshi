@_subject: [FYI] Antiques man guilty of Enigma charge  
The BBC article stated that it was a particular model of 4-rotor
enigma, of which there are only three known.
BTW, I spotted another 4-rotor Enigma as part of a museum display on
board the HMS Belfast, a WWII-era cruiser now permanently moored in
the Thames in London..
