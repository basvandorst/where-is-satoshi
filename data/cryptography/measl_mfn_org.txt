@_subject: the anvil problem 
Certainly not a nsec issue.  This is a personal problem for those who choose
to buy products that have these design flaws.  And no, I am not being "cute" - I am dead serious.  Anyone who would put out
their hard earned $$ for a product that is designed as XP is has the
inevitable disaster "coming to them".
Think back to what "copy protection" did to Ashton-Tate, then vote with your
wallet and refuse to buy into the XP disaster-in-waiting.

If Governments really want us to behave like civilized human beings, they
should give serious consideration towards setting a better example:
Ruling by force, rather than consensus; the unrestrained application of
unjust laws (which the victim-populations were never allowed input on in
the first place); the State policy of justice only for the rich and elected; the intentional abuse and occassionally destruction of entire
populations merely to distract an already apathetic and numb electorate...
This type of demogoguery must surely wipe out the fascist United States
as surely as it wiped out the fascist Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
The views expressed here are mine, and NOT those of my employers,
associates, or others.  Besides, if it *were* the opinion of all of
those people, I doubt there would be a problem to bitch about in the
first place...

@_subject: seeking information for Wired News article 
Why, after reading the questions presented below, think that Danit is
the *wrong* person to be writing this article?
Note that the term "community" here, while probably not accurate in
the strictest sense, is certainly a *LOT* more accurate than the
implied term "organization", which the vast majority of your questions
Cypherpunks are "organized" only in the sense that "they" manage to
get their shopping done when they run out of food.  There are CP's who
fall all over the 4 corners of the political spectrum, and all over
the physical world.  Realisticaly, about the only thing that they all
have in common is a strong interest in crypto, and a native suspicion
for most forms of "authority".
Now you've done it: expect 700 emails per day from MattD :-(
When did Humanity come into existence?  I'm serious here: CP merely
utilized a new communications medium.
Here we go with the "membership" thing again - You have it Completely
Wrong.  There are no "members", there is no "leadership", there is no
"Following" or "Group".  CP's are individuals who happen to identify
themselves as CP's - period.
The purpose?  You mean "What does The Group want to accomplish"?  See
Doctors, Lawyers, Mathematecians, Felons, Druggies, Anti-druggies,
Anarchists, Libertarians, Right-Wing-Fanatics, Left-Wing-Fanatics,
Teachers, Housewives, Househusbands, students, cops, criminals...
Agains, there IS NO GROUP.  I'm not trying to be cute here - THERE IS
NO GROUP.  The whole concept of "group" is flawed in this context.
Anyone's guess.  I personally know a bunch of folks who follow CP who
do so only out of curiosity: do I count them "in"? How about all the
federal agents who subscribe to the CP lists?  Getting the drift?
No.  There is no "Membership".
Varied.  Like the press itself.  Like the CP's themselves.  It is not
possible to place CP into any cubbyhole.
OooOoOooohhhhh....  "Internal Discussions"!  I like that: it implies
that (radical) Group thing again...  :-(
By some, and not others.
Sorry Kemosabe: most of the folks who refer to themselves as CP's are
less than "idealists".  And, since there IS NO F*@ GROUP, this
question is irrelevant.
Many: Google Is Your Friend.
"Official Statements"!  That's rich!!!  Tell you what - take one from
Column-A, and one from Column-B, where each column is the source of
your choice, and I'll [personally] acknowledge them as the Official
Statements of Whomever You Like.
I guess you should ask each CP individually.  Personally, my long term
plans are to Get Out Of Dodge (USA), before it turns into Germany in
1941.  My short term plans are to try and educate as many persons "in
authority" as possible in How The Real World Works, and as many
persons NOT "in authority" in How The Real World Works.
Maybe if someone were to form a CypherPunks GROUP, they would get
[I actually had to take a moment to wipe the tears of laughter from
the question]
Nobody.  Any such "alliance" would require a Group Consensus -
something which is just patently impossible.  If you ever find two
CP's who can agree on enough to come to a broad Consensus, you let me
know so I can mark it on my calendar.
Now *there* are questions I can answer.
Growth will continue, but the Vanillazation will also continue.  It's
a sorry (but inevitable) thing that once Big Business And Government
discover a communications medium it is reduced to it's most Vanilla

American world in particular, until some critical mass is reached, and
people again enter into the endless cycle of armed revolt.
...will continue to be passed solely for the benefit of the
legislators and their maggot financial backers, until some critical
mass is reached, and people again enter into the endless cycle of
armed revolt.
I assume you are refering to "Cracking" here...  It too will continue,
as it always has (before Cracking there was Phreaking.  Before
Phreaking the was Ham Radio?).  It's the allure of the Forbidden
According to my LEO contacts, phreaking is not only on a fast rise, it
is also a concern WAY above cracking.  .
Gawd, I just LOVE this concept!  In the mid 80's, one of my employers
used this concept to sell services to The Fedz - nothing's changed.
Of the Eight Critical Infrastructures identified by the USG, I
personally find it very difficult to believe that seven of them are
vulnerable to any societally significant "attack".  This is a
hilarious concept used to sell congresscritters and their military
counterparts on pork.
Joe Sixpack.  Jane Doe.  George Bush.  CP's are everybody and nobody.
CypherPunks Are People Who Give A Shit.
Most CP's wont be there - they wouldn't want to associate with any
group of people (note the lowercase "group") who would accept them as
a "member"...

@_subject: [Full-Disclosure] owning /dev/[u]random (fwd) 
known-plaintext attacks against various ciphers when /dev/random or
much up. However, I'm curious if anyone knows of a thread somewhere where
folks have discussed the implications of such a thing, and perhaps
formulated a strategy to attack any much-used applications like those
linked against openssl and using one of the ciphers therein.
SUNWSki package where someone might be able to write, say only 4 bytes of
data to /dev/random using a race condition or other such trickery. There
are a few cases (like padding ciphertext in a block cipher) where this
might be enough of a toehold to try a known-plaintext attack. If the
implications were serious enough, an attacker who owns a machine may
choose _only_ to alter the /dev/random or /dev/urandom devices for some
nefarious purpose. Of course it'd probably be much more fruitful to simply
trojan all the shells. However, it's pretty tough to use AIDE or Tripwire
on /dev/random or /dev/urandom (So, I'm guessing that they don't check to
make sure that these are actually character devices). So, it might be
pretty a pretty sneaky trick to own the machine, add your known-plaintext
in place of /dev/random or /dev/urandom, then put the box back like it was
before anyone checks the MD5 hashes.
Before anyone flames me, I'd like to use a tactic pioneered by RFP, and
safe the troll some time:
1. I have a small penis
2. I don't know shit.
3. I'm not a _true_ hacker/blackhat/whatever.

they're changed or help speed the change by breaking them?

Good Evening,
Missouri may well be a poster child for backwater living, but they had an
unusual thing to recommend them: they understood that a "Driver's
License" was somthing you got to prove you knew how to drive a car, rather
than something you got to drink beer and vote.  Presumable due to this
revelation, Missouri did not actually *require* either a photo or a social
security number for the issuance of a driver's license.  different encoded "license number", and anyone who objected to the photo had
a red box in the corner with the words "PHOTO NOT REQUIRED" emblazoned across
it - you needed only to fill out the form which described the basis of your
any license.  Just a piece of paper (no plastic at all) that said you knew
enough to drive.  Proving that the license belonged to *you*, and not someone
else, required actual *ID*!

I believe we are missing an important point: anonymizers can be used (against
their AUPs) to send "anonymous advertising".  In real life, this happens a
*lot*.  Sure, we know the beneficiary site, however, this law will impact the
innocent anonymizer in this case, and not the scum who actually caused the
email to be sent out in the first place.
I have several defunct mixmaster addresses which bounce *hundreds* of
attempts to sue them for spam evey week.  This is a real problem.

Recently a list member requested public ftp/web space for the hosting of
various crypto files.  Although I replied both to him and to the list, I
did not realize I had been unsubscribed by a mail loop :-/
So, just for those of you who didn't get it the first time, we have
facilities which are available to anyone on the list looking to make
non-commercial use of the space provided.  FTP or HTTP, at your domain
name or a sub of one of ours, we don't care - the offer is open to all.
The boxen themselves are well connected, and multihomed, so they're always
up unless (a) I decide to login and botch an upgrade, or (b) the data
center falls down :-)

While I am glad it worked out for you, I somehow doubt that the workers of

Fortunately, I found a way around the problem that didn't force me to try
and find out though!
This is probably a uniquely american thing - culturally we are a bunch of
loners, who all believe that the government has no *right* to "identify"
or otherwise monitor us.  As a scrappy bunch of loners with attitude
problems, the pros vs. cons of The Card really never make it to the
equation: as a people, most of us just naturally have a Time May reaction
to authority in general and government authority in particular.
Personally, I'd rather go back to the old paper license I used to have in
the 80's that had no pic and was not usable as ID, but I know it isn't
going to happen.  Sigh...
