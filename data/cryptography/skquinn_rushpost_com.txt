I won't believe this is true until someone cites the statute, and
exactly which agency needs to issue a license to make it legal. I would
also like to know the rationale for requiring a license, i.e., what are
they trying to prevent by not allowing any random goober to
Faraday/Tempest shield their building?

Yuck. Another "great if you run Windows, a real PITA if you run anything
else" feature.
I don't use sleep mode all that often on my GNU/Linux systems, but
having sleep mode as we know it not even exist as an option is at best
problematic and at worst a absolute disaster.

Generally, depending on binary blobs is a bad idea. Though a later post
indicates it may be possible to update just the signatures, which would
at least be a decent stopgap measure (i.e. fix the immediate issue of

Most people are referring to the mean when they say "the average." The
difference between mean, median, and mode is seen by most of the
population as something that only math geeks obsess over. I'm not saying
I agree with that, just that that is what I have observed.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Bizarre behavior of a non-smart mobile phone 
Bad hardware (particularly the make call and end call/power off buttons)
comes to mind, though bad software is also possible. (I had a feature
phone that would power off and/or lock up at random, though it didn't
make random phone calls like yours did).

Notice how you had to call it the Morris worm?
Before Microsoft Windows was internet capable, it was simply called The
Internet Worm. As in, the one, singular. Now, you have to call it the
Morris worm to differentiate it from all the Windows worms that have
come since.
And I would say the response has been anything but "do nothing." If I
remember right, Morris was criminally prosecuted even though there were
no specific laws against computer viruses/worms in 1988.
My response to the parade of Windows worms was to quit running Windows
on my own PCs, which is one of the smartest decisions I've ever made.

It is, however, quite possibly unlawful to possess two valid driver's
licenses at the same time. At least, this is the law here in Texas where
I live.
