I heard??The Flight of the Bumblebee? performed by an IBM 1620 in 1965 (at Harvey Mudd College), along with a number of other classical?pieces. You had to put an AM radio on the console to hear the music. In addition, there were a number of Pong-like games, using the lights?on the right side of the 1620's console that you had to manipulate with the four sense switches. Unfortunately, it didn't have a paper tape punch for the percussion, or a line-printer, either. (That would have to wait until I got access to an IBM 1401, which had both.)
