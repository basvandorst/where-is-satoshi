people looking for compilable source or who prefer ASCII documents, so
it is also reasonable to reference an RFC.

I'm not saying there might not be a level of error or weakness that
would cause a emergency reset of the standards process. I'm saying that
this diddle-shit minor DoS attack isn't such an error or weakness. It
was fully known about by the 802.11 working group, repeatedly debated at
great length, and discounted as being insignificant. Therefore, an
improvement which merely eliminated it has only a vanishingly small
probability of upsetting the apple-cart.
In the academic world, certainly any minor and even
currently-impractical-to-exploit weakness is of great interest. In the
real world, products have substantial lead times and at some point you
have to stop investigating minor improvements and start cranking out
Go ahead and design whatever wonderful improvements in TKIP you want.
Perhaps you can publish a paper or two. But unless you find something a
lot bigger wrong with it, I predict the standard will not be changed,
particularly given that TKIP is temporary and within a few years the
deployed hardware population will be swamped with newer hardware
supporting CCMP mode.

You can answer this question just as easily as I can. All you have to do is read the mind of all the voting members of 802.11.
All predictions I've seen show exponential growth in 802.11 equipment
through 2007. There is trenendous growth in new 802.11 installations and
upgrades to existing implementations. There are corporations that really
care about security and are today forcing everyone using their corporate
net to get wireless cards (and use them even for PCs with built in
wireless) that use proprietary stuff now and are guaranteed upgradable
to the 802.11I stadard when it comes out.
802.11a hardware has been shipping for some time. No one has to build
802.11a systems supporting TKIP if they don't want to. But it would have
been silly to try to somehow restrict TKIP to 802.11b given what a
massive improvement it is over WEP, even though it is not as strong as
CCMP. For 802.11i to spend cycles on a TKIPa for 802.11a would just slow
down getting CCMP out.
OK, if you think it is so trivial, please outline the exact steps needed to execute this Denial of Service attack. I don't think you begin to understand how hard it would be.
Network availability goes to zero with many cordless phone systems or any microwave oven operating at the right frequence range if you remove the shielding from the microwave (it is not recommended that you be too close to the microwave when it is operating in that mode unless you cause its output to be directed away from you).
The WiFi Alliance is a marketing and interoperability organization, not a standards or techncial organization.
The IEEE process is document at exhaustive length in IEEE documents and
has been followed. Any person interested can participate. Anyone can
propose to 802.11 that a liaison be set up with any orther organization.
At this time, over 2/3rds of all IEEE 802 members are in 802.11 making
it the most widely representative of all 802 working groups with
attendance commonly over 300 persons.
Your idea that the "public", whatever you mean by that, should be
consulted is pretty hilarious. The idea that the average man on the street is a great source of wisdom for secure communications protocol design is not widely held.
Perhaps they would support you. Enought scare stories in the press
exaggerating the significance of denial of service due to TKIP
countermeasures could easily stampede the public.
All this has been debated many times in 802.11i. Securing management
messages would certainly cause a considerable increase in the complexity
of the protocol. Think about all the weird conditions that can occur
with loss of state and or messages on one side or the other, either
after set up or, even worse, during set up when, perhaps, one side has
keys but the other doesn't... You generally end up with states where you
have to do a lengthy time out and then assume the association has been
broken, because the other side doesn't have keys to authenticate its
attempts to disassociate. And the additional complexity isn't going to
help your reliability any.
Come on. How many facilities are going to have equipment sophisticated
enough to do trianguation? And if they do, I'm it would probably be
modern stuff quite capable of triangulating a packet a minute. There is
no practical difference.

@_subject: privacy <> digital rights management 
The spectrum from 2 people knowing something to 2 billion knowing
something is pretty smooth and continuous. Both DRM and privacy have to
do with controlling material after you have released it to someone who
might wish to pass it on further against your wishes. There is little
*tehcnical* difference between your doctors records being passed on to
assorted insurance companies, your boss, and/or tabloid newspapers and
the latest Disney movies being passed on from a country where it has
been released to people/theaters in a country where it has not been
The only case where all holders of information always have a common
interest is where the number of holder is one.
"Privacy", according to the usual definitions, involve controlling the
spread of information by persons autorized to have it. Contrast with
secrecy which primarily has to do with stopping the spread of
information through the actions of those not authorized to have it.
That's secrecy technology, not privacy technology.
Sure, you can't have either privacy or DRM with plain paper texts or
plaintext digital data on untrusted hardware. That's pretty obvious. A
xerographic copier works just as well on a "private" handwritten letter
as it does on a mass produced printed page. And if you want to argue
that total privacy and DRM are unobtainable because anyone knowing
something in their mind can trasnmit it in plain text, sure. But that
does not mean that, at least in principal, it is impossible to achieve
"technical privacy"  thorugh crypto and trusted hardware where the
information can not be improperly passed on by an authorized holder
other than via their mind.
You are confusing privacy with secrecy and are confusing
accidental/historic differences between privacy and DRM with their
essential techncial identity.

@_subject: New Protection for 802.11 
Well, you see some of the people working on improving 802.11 security,
in particular some members of 802.11 Task Group i noted that IEEE
procedures have no interoperability demonstration requirements. So they
formed a little group that took a subset of the then current 802.11i
draft and tried to implement it and interoperate. (Problems were found
and fixes feed back into the standards process.) The subset choosen,
called SSN, included the 802.1X authentication and anti-replay features
of 802.11i and the TKIP branch of 802.11i. SSN does not cover ad-hoc (station to station) mode, only station <-> access point.
(The current 802.11i draft has three branch,
firmware/sofware upgrade that uses RC4, but with a different key for
every packet, plus a specially designed (for weak legacy hardware) keyed
message integrity code with about 22 bits of strength (optional)
that uses AES in OCB mode for encryption and integrity (optional)
that is, AES-CTR for encryption and AES-CBC-MAC for integrity.  There being a lot of pressure for improved security soon, the WiFi
Alliance essentiallly adopted SSN with some profiling as a security
certification standard and called this WiFi Protected Access (WPA) v1.
The plan is for full 802.11i to be called WiFi Protected Access v2.

Needless to say, this has been discussed time and time again in the meetings and on the mailing list of IEEE 802.11i.
That's right, there is this TKIP branch of 802.11i to support the 15,000,000+ legacy units out there. If you can come up with a better MIC that almost all of them can support with just a firmware upgrade, you are welcome to submit it but to overcome the current commitment it would need to be substantially better and out pretty quick.
So throw all your legacy hardware in the trash (or sell it on eBay), get
only new hardware, and don't enable TKIP, if you are so worried about
Mission critial uses on an unlicensed band where 802.11b gets to fight
it out with blue tooth, cordless phones, diathermy machines, and who
knows what else? (at least efforts are underway to coordinate with blue
I think the feeling was there are lots of ways you can run insecure if
you want. Like just using WEP. If you want to be secure with legacy
hardware, you need countermeasures. If you don't want to be secure, you don't need any of TKIP or the rest of 802.11i.
There is verbage about logging and alerting. Any implementor could add
the specific mechanism you suggest if they wanted.
I believe the thinking in 802.11i was that TKIP should run on
essentiallly 100% of the firmware upgradable legacy hardware that
vendors were willing to talk to 802.11i about.
In a year, full 802.11i hardware will be shipping (aka WPA v2). Given
that rapid growth in 802.11 is projected to continue at least through
2007, the world will soon be dominated by new hardware.

============================== START ==============================
If you want to play with this as in intellectual exercise, be my guest.  But the probability of changing the underlying IEEE 802.11i draft
standard, which would take a 3/4 majority of the voting members of IEEE
802.11, or of making the WiFi Alliance WPA profiling and subseting of
802.11i incompatible with the standard, are close to zero.
Of course it is not true for all existing hardware. TKIP neede to run on more or less the feeblest legacy 802.11b hardware. Vendors of new hardware are intetested in supporting the stronger mandatory parts of 802.11i (which will be know as WPA v2). The only reason I can think of that a vendor might want to support something incompatible is to lock in customers, probably because they had at least a patent pending on it.

While I'm not claiming RC4 is strong, the main problem is that WEP misuses it. At I understand it, the recommendation for a long time has been that you either throw away the first 256 bytes of stream key output or use a different key on every message. WEP does neither. TKIP, the new security mode for 802.11 designed for feeble legacy hardware, still uses RC4 but does change keys on every message.

You are coming at this from a software/computer mindset that just isn't
applicable to this sort of physical world security. Sure, in the ~0
fabrication and distribution cost world of software, you might as well
use strong crypto because its costs ~0 and probably a lot of the other
weaknesses are also software and can also be avoided for ~0 cost.
If you can think of a more secure physical lock design that is CHEAPER,
run out and patent it now. You will probably make money. But most
substantially more secure physical locks are substantially more
expensive to fabric being more complex and frequently requiring tighter
mechanical tolerances.
It is usually not that hard to gain invisible access even with quite
crude methods.
The lock almost never has anything to do with it. Why is it you never
see simple pin tumbler locks on safes and vaults? Because, with
substantial metal and/or solid reinforced concrete walls on all sides
and no windows, it is actually worth the cost of good combination locks,
possibly with time lock in addition.
If I wanted to make a building more secure, even if for some reason I'm
just looking at the only door, there are a lot of things I'd look at
right away: Are the hinges on the outside and if so what steps have
beeen taken to stop someone from removing the hinge pins and removing
the door? Is there an astragal to stop people from credit-carding the
door? What steps have been made to stop someone from spreading the door
frame so that any bolts no longer latch? If there is a lock cylinder,
can you just unscrew it from the outside and open the door with a
scredriver (I have determined by experimentation that most cylinder set
screws will easily give way and allow you to unscrew the cylinder with
minimal damage)? Is there any kind of opening above the door, like a
transom (even if it is tiny, you may be able to drop a loop down inside
and turn the internal door knob, opening the door despite its being
locked for the outside knob)? Etc. Etc. Oh, and I suppose you could
think about attacks on the security of the lock itself, which is
probably pin tumbler.
But it probably has lots of window/wall/roof/basement/etc. weaknesses
that have nothing to do with the door.
It's just silly to spend, say, $50 more, on a more secure lock unless
you are really willing, in the forseeable future, to spend hundreds or
thousands of dollars or even more on other weaknesses to make most of
them approximately as strong.
There are also other factors in planning physical security. I've had to
actually break through a wall because an electronic lock's battery back
up power died because the transformer for a building was being replaced
and it had absolutely no power feed for a few days. The repair of such
wall damage is an expense. Mechanical devices do not have the problem of
requiring power (PS: Brass is self lubricating).
There are markets for a wide variety of locks. I do not believe that
high security or low security mechanical locks will disappear in my
