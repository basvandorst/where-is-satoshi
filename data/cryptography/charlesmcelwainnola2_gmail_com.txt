Oh, puhleezzzz.
So, "impressive qualifications in intersectional feminism" as exemplified by such as Elizabeth Smith Friedman, (Deputy Director) Anna Caracristi, Maureen Baginski, Dorothy Blum, Sarah Botsai, Mary Budenbach, Barbara Clark, Wilma Davis, Agnes Driscoll, Genevieve Feinstein, Minnie Kenny, Velva Klaessy, Barbara McNamara, Marie Meyer, Juliana Mickwitz, Juanita Moody, Mary Louise Prather, Renetta Predmore-Lynch, Katherine Swift, Julia Wetzel, and Ruth Wilson.
Just to name a few off the top of my head (and the top of the modern honorees in the NSA’s “Women in American Cryptology”).
And perhaps, to add the women chronicled in Liza Mundy’s recent book, “Code Girls”, on Dot Braden and the other women working during WWII for the Army and Navy crypto efforts, at Arlington Hall and elsewhere.
These are some of the people who can inspire Robin Wood’s daughter, and youngsters - recall the recent thread on “paragraph with expected frequencies”.  Such comments as above do nothing for educating those of the future.
