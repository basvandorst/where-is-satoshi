@_subject: SDSI/SPKI background 
Hi, I'm currently preparing courses about telecommunication security
architectures and protocols of which certificates are a main
building block for authentication and authorisation.
I'm presenting the PKI/PMI-models with X.509 as mainly used architecture today and PGP as the distributed model.
I also want to present SDSI/SPKI but as far as I know, work in this
direction seems to have stopped: The IETF WG was closed and some
drafts weren't finished as RFCs. Nevertheless there are interesting
ideas which are worth showing in contrast to X.509.
I still have two open points which I couldn't resolve by searching
and reading:
* Are there other authorisation certificate standards besides   SDSI/SPKI?
* What are the main reasons that work on SDSI/SPKI stopped although
  much work was already done?    tschuess

Hi Carl, I guess its the draft about the certificate structure?
Is there a special reason why the authorisation system can't or
shouldn't be open here? Most systems and services are distributed and
are developed independently, so an open standard would be reasonable
here too, wouldn't it?
agreed :)
I couldn't access the latter one but found a copy on citeseer
sure, but I like the idea of storing the privileges independent of the
service instance; of course there are drawbacks (revocation)...
Thanks &&

@_subject: OpenVPN and "SSL VPNs" 
I already stumbled several times over OpenVPN but never
had the time to look at it in detail. Now I had but didn't
find many infos except "many lucky users" and few negative
I have two open points:
a) It would be good to hear from this community if there
are any negative aspects of OpenVPN (vs. IPsec VPNs).
b) I still have a problem with the term "SSL/TLS VPN". What
OpenVPN seems to do is use SSL for authentication and
key exchange/rekeying, but does use "ESP similar"
data protection schemes/formats. Does the usage of
SSL on a "control plane" make OpenVPN an "SSL VPN"?
This sounds to me like calling something a car just
because it uses a steering wheel... So far I thought
about SSL VPNs as doing everything over SSL (with
the known disadvantages...).
