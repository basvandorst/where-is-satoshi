Hi John, and thanks for the feedback.  We just finished some major
improvements to that script, including better grading of the cipher
strengths and a warning section for potential security risks.
Documentation has been improved too (
 Here is how it looks
using the current SVN version of Nmap against that server:
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 flightplanning.navcanada.ca
Starting Nmap 6.47SVN (  ) at 2014-11-11 14:07 PST
Nmap scan report for flightplanning.navcanada.ca (207.236.24.143)
Host is up (0.089s latency).
rDNS record for 207.236.24.143: PORT    STATE SERVICE
443/tcp open  https
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.91 seconds
If anyone has further feedback on this script, you're also encouraged to
send it to our dev list for discussion (dev at nmap.org).
