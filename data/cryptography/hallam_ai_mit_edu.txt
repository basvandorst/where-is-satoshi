Methinks you complain too much.
PKI is in widespread use, it is just not that noticeable when you use it.
This is how it should be. SSL is widely used to secure internet payment
transactions. S/MIME use is significant and growing.
The financial industry is not looking at offline PKI models in general. This
is not surprising since they use very few offline systems. Hence
certificate/CRL based models which were first promoted for use with email
are tending to be replaced by online systems such as OCSP and ultimately
XKMS which allows the certificate to be dispensed with entirely if required.
What we are not seeing is demand for naming semantics of the form 'the
person who fred call's jim'.
As for what PKI vendors have been up to, the sucessful ones have been
supporting private label certification hierarchies from the start.
