If I understood it correctly, they want to keep "only" the
traffic-analysis data, the SMTP server logs, not the messages themselves
(though I'd bet they would love to, if it would be reasonably practical).
I am curious if this applies even on provately-operated servers; eg, if
you aren't cheap and instead of an account you buy a colocation server,
with your own mailserver, when the ISP provides only the connection
itself, without additional services.

SMTP servers, if they have to receive mails, HAVE to listen on port 25.
There is no way in the standard how to tell that SMTP on
whateverserver.com listens in port 1234 instead.
However, if it is only a server for sending mails, it CAN listen on
any other port (which then has to be specified in the mail client
configuration). You can also have your own internal mail forwarding
network on nondefault ports; eg, qmail allows manual specifying of server
and port to any domain it has to forward mail to (in default
configuration, /var/qmail/conf/smtproutes).
For SSL-wrapping of the connections to SMTP/POP/IMAP servers (or even to
offshore HTTP proxies), stunnel  is the tool of
choice; many mail clients have SSL support, but they typically lack
certificate management.

There are ways to prove it.
You can use web bugs embedded in HTML mail, fetching an object from a
tracking server. This doesn't work with some mailers, however Outlooks to
version 5.5 are vulnerable for sure and numerous other ones are as well.
This approach is already widely used for checking the validity of email
You can count the clickthroughs from the mails, thus not measuring the
impressions themselves, but the raw success. The spammer then can be paid
not per mail sent, but per URL clicked to - leading to a new level of
various confusing and enticing tactics.
You can also share profit with the spammer using some kind of provision
per sale, thus fully outsourcing your advertising.
Possibly there are yet other ways.
