@_subject: A Trial Balloon to Ban Email? 
If we assume an environment where a payor/spender can later check to see
if their payment was cashed, this also creates a relatively cheap way for spammers to create or validate a list of working email Hash-based lists of spam messages have this property, too - a recipient
of a unique message implicitly validates their email address by reporting the message or its hash to a public database of known spams,
if the sender of the message cares to go back and check to see which
of their sent messages have been reported.
Exploits of those features may be a few steps down the road in the spam
arms race, but it's not unthinkable ...
