I just ran across
  but there are many more sites like that:
  Secure multiple websites with a single PremiumSSL Certificate. For
  organisations hosting a single domain name but with different
  subdomains (e.g. secure.centurywebdesign.co.uk,
   signup.centurywebdesign.co.uk), the
  wildcard Certificate is a cost effective and efficient means of
  securing all subdomains without the need to manage multiple
  certificates. All the features, compatibility and warranty of
  PremiumSSL included.
This strikes me as notoriously bad, although it is in accordance
with the RFC. I still don't want to accept the usefulness and
inherent security, so I'd like to get some expert opinions on this.
Are wildcard certficates good? secure? useful?

My key, 220BC883330C4A75, has multiple encryption subkeys, and it's
about to get another one on Friday, as my current encryption key
A lot of people are reporting that they cannot encrypt to me, due to
an unusable public key. It only seems to work if they use modern

I am already working with keyserver maintainers to get their

I need to get an exact understanding of what's going on.
Could someone help me clean up this understanding?
- What is the problem with multiple subkeys?
- Are they in accordance with the RFC (2440)?
- Are others experiencing these problems, and how do you deal with
  them?
- Is there a solution in the works?
- If not, has anyone already thought about how to solve this mess?

As far as I can tell, IPsec's ESP has the functionality of
authentication and integrity built in:
RFC 2406:
   2.7 Authentication Data
   The Authentication Data is a variable-length field containing an
   Integrity Check Value (ICV) computed over the ESP packet minus
   the Authentication Data.  The length of the field is specified by
   the authentication function selected.  The Authentication Data
   field is optional, and is included only if the authentication
   service has been selected for the SA in question.  The
   authentication algorithm specification MUST specify the length of
   the ICV and the comparison rules and processing steps for
   validation.
To my knowledge, IPsec implementations use AH for "signing" though.
Why do we need AH, or why is it preferred?

@_subject: DH: pubkeys for p and g 
The Check Point Firewall-1 Docs insist, that the public keys be used
for p and g for the Oakley key exchange. I ask you: is this
  - which of the two pubkeys will be p, which g?
  - are they both always primes?
  - are they both always suitable generators mod p?
It just seems to me that Check Point isn't entirely sure themselves
here. I'd appreciate a short cleanup...
To my knowledge, g and p are globally defined, either in DH Groups
(which are nothing but pre-defined g's and p's, right?), or
otherwise set constant. Am I wrong about this?

@_date: 2003-06-27 00:29:47
@_author: martin f krafft 
@_subject: pubkeys for p and g 
To clear this up:
I am well aware how DH works, and what the mathematical properties
of p and g are and have to be.
My point was that some commercial vendors (Check Point and others)
claim, that if two partners want to perform a DH key exchange, they
may use their two public keys for g and p. This, in effect, would
mean that g and p were not globally known, but that the public keys
are used in their place.
I am well aware that p and g are globally known as defined in the
chosen DH Group. However, I am wondering how Check Point (and
others) can claim that public keys may well be used in place,
thereby invalidating the need for a globally constant p and g pair.
These public keys are independent of the public keys exchanged as
part of DH, which are simply calculated by the g^x mod p formula of
DH, from the private keys.
Thus every communication party would have a key pair, aA and bB,
where the capital letter is the public key. Then, the following
  let g = A and p = B
  let A' = g^a mod p and B' = g^b mod p
         = A^a mod B        = A^b mod B
and off you go, doing DH with g = A, p = B, and the keypairs aA' and
bB' on either side.
This would, in my opinion, only be possible if:
  - there would be a rule to decide which public key is p and which
    is g.
  - all public keys (RSA in this case) are primes.
  - all public keys are good generators mod p.
We are writing a book and simply want to have some backup. I am
almost sure that Check Point is bullshitting (wouldn't be the first
time), so unless anyone has actually heard of this possibility, I am
going to write this down and influence a thousand people, basically
claiming that Check Point is wrong.
Does it make sense now?

@_subject: quantum hype 
Dear Cryptoexperts,
  and the general hype about quantum cryptography, I am bugged by
a question that I can't really solve. I understand the quantum
theory and how it makes it impossible for two parties to read the
same stream. However, what I don't understand is how that adds to
The main problem I have with understanding the technology is in the
fact that any observation of the quantum stream is immediately
detectable -- but at the recipient's side, and only if checksums are
being employed, which are not disturbed by continual or sporadic
photon flips.
So MagiQ and others claim that the technology is theoretically
unbreakable. How so? If I have 20 bytes of data to send, and someone
reads the photon stream before the recipient, that someone will have
access to the 20 bytes before the recipient can look at the 20
bytes, decide they have been "tampered" with, and alert the sender.
So I use symmetric encryption and quantum cryptography for the key
exchange... the same situation here. Maybe the recipient will be
able to tell the sender about the junk it receives, but Mallory
already has read some of the text being ciphered.
In addition to that, the MITM attack seems to be pertinent, unless
I use public-key encryption and authentication. But then I am back
to cryptography whose strength is based on intractability and not on
a proof. And now I fail to see why quantum crypto is hyped so much.
Maybe I am completely misguided, but I would really appreciate some
explanation or even pointers. Or someone wants to spend a couple of
minutes to explain the process of theoretically unbreakable quantum
cryptography step-by-step.
Note: I am reading MagiQ's press release with the
subtract-marketing-b/s grain of salt. Of course, their technology is
superior to everything. However, most of my information and the food
for my questions stem from the more scientific side, having read
about it in articles in renowned magazines and mailing list posts.

It took me a while. I would herewith like to reply to all posts on
this I received so far:
also sprach John S. Denker  [2003.09.13.2343 +0200]:
This is what I don't buy. If Mallory sees the data, it must be
detected, because otherwise the approach is flawed. But in any case
does Mallory have the means to completely DoS any attempt of
communication between the parties, simply by reading along, unless
there is a dedicated channel between Alice and Bob. In which case,
why is there a need for quantum cryptography in the first place?
One chance in 2^C, otherwise it would be deadly, no? But in any
case, Reasonable keysized DH exchanges give me the same security
with a lot more flexibility, and a lot less chance for DoS. I still
don't buy it.
... which is almost always required.
How can you check for tampering without reading the data off the
channel? Checksums?
The same argument holds as above, why do I need QC then if I have
a dedicated channel anyhow?
Sending asymmetrically encrypted data over something like the plain
old telephone system strikes me as being more secure than sending
these data over the Internet, and that should hold for any
encryption used. Unless QC is applicable to the Internet (which it
won't be, as far as I can tell), I don't see any use beyond
marketing hype.
Sure, DH and similar approaches are based on mathematical
assumptions and are not secure, just incredibly hard to crack. But
just as I can choose a larger C for QC to diminish Mallory's chance
of decoding enough data to be able to make sense of the message
without being detected, I can choose a keysize of 16k if the
application calls for it. DH has been scrutinised and is, to current
knowledge, a theoretically secure algorithm. Or am I mistaken?
also sprach David Wagner  [2003.09.13.2343 +0200]:
I don't think this is wrong, but I still don't see how QC guards
against eavesdropping. No, wrong, I see how a key exchange with QC
can make it very difficult to eavesdrop the key (more difficult than
DH?), but I do render the communication susceptible to complete DoS,
and I don't really gain security, IMHO.
also sprach John S. Denker  [2003.09.14.0102 +0200]:
But the tunnel is only confidential as long as it isn't being
eavesdropped. As soon as someone eavesdrops it, I may be able to
find out, but I have already lost data to unwanted eyes. And if
I thus choose to end communication due to the risk of disclosing
more, the DoS worked.
I hope I am not annoying anyone while continually banging on this.
I just have not been convinced of the other side of this argument.
also sprach David Wagner  [2003.09.14.0018 +0200]:

Blowfish, 256bit keys, perfect forward secrecy, and a session key

also sprach Arnold G. Reinhold  [2003.09.14.0536 +0200]:
And a disadvantage: disk corruption, which may render your channel
temporarily inaccessible. Also, once someone gets hold of the data
on the disk, everyone can read along. It's the same problem of all
symmetric algorithms, enhanced by the fact that the key data is
stored on a medium other than a human neural network (which to date
is only readable by one person)

wrong. i don't consider those that shouldn't know about some things

seeks information. but if i want my girlfriend not to see those
mails i send to this other chick (i have no girlfriend btw),
i encrypt them and guard against the risk that i leave the window
open when she comes home and she accidentally hits enter to read
that email.
i also don't consider an ISP an enemy who does network-related
maintenance and happens to read into my data stream. heck, maybe the
guy is even interested and reads along for his pleasure. he's not an
enemy. but using crypto will still prevent this.
i guess it's a matter of definition, so let's just leave it there.
Now this makes a lot more sense. Somehow I thought that QC simply
flipped the bit. But then nature isn't binary, neither is physics,
so I was just dumb.
You seem to have a lot more of a grasp than I.
Anyhow, we are deviating here and there from the topic. So let me
  - QC, if correctly used, can serve as the basis for OTP
    encryption.
  - The provable security of QC thus actually comes from OTP.
  - QC needs an unbroken channel. The channel does not have to be
    private because an observer destroys photons, which can be
    detected.
  - This observer could DoS the communication, but that's akin to
    cutting the land-line.
  - Actually, no, because if I don't rely on QC but have other
    means, I can switch to another medium if someone cuts my
    landline.
There were other points, but I concentrated on the technical ones
and hope I left none out.
