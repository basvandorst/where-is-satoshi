Please stop relaying FUD. You have full control over your PC, even if this
one is equiped with a TCPA chip. See the TCPA chip as a hardware security
module integrated into your PC. An API exists to use it, and one if the
functions of this API is 'take ownership', which has the effect of
erasing it and regenerating new internal keys.

I've read your objections. Maybe I wasn't clear. What's wrong in
installing a cryptographic device by default on PC motherboards?
I work for a PKI 'vendor', and for me, software private keys is a
nonsense. How will you convice "Mr Smith" (or Mme Michu) to buy an
expensive CC EAL4+ evaluated token, install the drivers, and solve the
inevitable conflicts that will occur, simply to store his private key? You
first have to be good to convice him to justify the extra depense.
If a standard secure hardware cryptographic device is installed by default
on PCs, it's OK! You could obviously say that Mr Smith won't be able to
move his certificates from machine A to machine B, but more than 98% of
the time, Mr Smith doesn't need to do that.
Installing a TCPA chip is not a bad idea. It is as 'trustable' as any
other cryptographic device, internal or external. What is bad is accepting
to buy a software that you won't be able to use if you decide to claim
your ownership... Palladium is bad, TCPA is not bad. Don't confuse the

And do you seriously think that "you can't do that, it's technically not
possible" is a good answer? That's what you're saying. For me, a better
answer is "you don't have the right to deny my ownership".

How? TCPA is only a cryptographic device, and some BIOS code, nothing
else. Does the coming of TCPA chips eliminate the bugs, buffer overflows,
stack overflows, or any other way to execute arbitrary code? If yes, isn't
that a wonderful thing? Obviously it doesn't (eliminate bugs and so on).
I use cryptographic devices everyday, and TCPA is not different than the
present situation. No better, no worse.

@_subject: and constrained subordinate CA costs? 
Yes, the nameConstraints extension. But nobody checks it, and since this
extension MUST be critical as per RFC3280, it invalidates the CA
certificate that includes it, making it useless, for now.
The X.509 standard provides less examples of the possible applications of
this extension than the RFC3280.

The private key is hosted by Symantec, but most likely on a shared online
HSM, on their Managed PKI service.
I guess someone from BlueCoat has a clientAuth certificate to approve the
generation of subscriber certificates.
Hopefully, IIRC, Managed PKI doesn't allow the client admin to change
certificate profiles.

2016-05-31 16:34 GMT+02:00 Phillip Hallam-Baker :
A CA certificate containing a BasicConstraints with pathLenConstraint=0
means that this CA certificate can only be used to verify an end-entity
certificate, or a CA certificate that doesn't issue any certificate, but
not a CA certificate that itself would issue another certificate (either CA
or end-entity).
To simplify:
 CA(BC:pathLenConstraint=0) -> end-entity : OK
 CA(BC:pathLenConstraint=0) -> CA(anything) : OK
 CA(BC:pathLenConstraint=0) -> CA(anything) -> any certificate : NOT OK
As in, what is the effect on systems out there in the wild as opposed to
0 is not infinity. Infinity is expressed as the absence of the
pathLenConstraint field.
Some not so old versions of GnuTLS didn't correctly verify the
pathLenConstraint, at least. I think it was corrected in 2014.
OpenSSL, NSS, MSCAPI, and Opera are OK. Don't know about PolarSSL/mbedTLS
or other smaller TLS stacks.

Correct. Or by declaring the module as EXTENSIBILITY IMPLIED, or simply by
using BER/DER (where extensibility is implied in the deciding phase even if
the module doesn't declare it).

PER also can support the encoding of data with a reduced number of bits
when told so. For example if a field is declared as 2 characters from the
[A,Z] set, an instance of this field will be encoded using 10 bits only.
Similar optimizations are applied to integers.

PER has 2 possible (cumulative) variants: unaligned, and canonical.
There's not that much space left in PER for not being canonical. IIRC, SET
ordering and padding are the only place where there's a difference.
I haven't found a *commercial* compiler that generates the canonical
It's true that there aren't many (any?) open source implementations of
asn1c ( supports PER. It also supports 2008
ASN.1 (while several compilers only support the 1988 dialect).
Unfortunately, the support of information object sets isn't complete, and I
think it doesn't support parameterized types.
But apart from that, it does a good job.

Right. X.208 didn't have anything about extensibility, it was added in
X.680 1997 edition (in fact it was introduced as an amendment in 1995).
X.690 1994 edition obviously didn't contain anything about extensibility.
Reading X.509, only the 2 or 3 latest editions (of X.509v3) have
extensibility declared. That is, the type TBSCertificate has seen added
elements (2 identifiers in v2, and the extensions in v3), but this type has
been redefined only recently to include the extensibility markers (and
misplaced version markers).
X.209 (the ancestor of X.690) only defined BER, not even DER.
It still is, as OER is pretty recent, and JSER should be finalized shortly.
ASN.1 is far from being dead :)
