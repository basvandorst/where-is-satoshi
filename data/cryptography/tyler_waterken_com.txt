Now available on the Waterken Inc. site is a specification and
implementation for a new HTTP extension, HTTPSY.
HTTPSY provides decentralized, peer-to-peer authentication for the
WWW. For those familiar with E , HTTPSY
is feature equivalent to E's VatTP + VLS. HTTPSY is primarily
aimed at being a secure substrate for web services, but can also
be used for secure web surfing.
Both httpsy:// and E's cap:// are implementations of what I have
named YURLs. You can read about the concepts behind YURLs at:
The httpsy:// specification is at:
There is a java.net.URL implementation of httpsy:// at:
The Waterken Inc. site is running the Waterken Server, which
implements the server side of httpsy://. Sue Butler has built a
simple WWW browser which you can use to surf the Waterken Inc.
site over httpsy://. The browser is at:
The default bookmarks file for the browser provides an httpsy://
link to the Waterken Inc. site.
The Waterken Browser implements a Pet Name system for trust
relationship management. See:
I believe httpsy:// + a Pet Name system solves many of the
problems with https:// that have recently been highlighted on this
mailing list.

Hi Ed,
I have demonstrated the theory behind YURLs by providing an
implementation, the Waterken Browser, and by explaining how two
other widely used systems implement the theory. Please clarify
your concerns by providing a detailed attack description for any
one of these three implementations.

The security properties enforced by a YURL implementation are
clearly defined at:
If you doubt the value of this security model, I point out, as
empirical evidence only, that SSH and PGP use the same security
I asked Ed to provide an attack on the implementation because his
arguments lacked focus and clarity. For example, he referred to
MITM without specifying any details, such as what middle.  I was
hoping that by focusing on the implementation, his understanding
of the theoretical model would be improved.
Please read the provided documentation.  The YURL Definition
establishes the criteria and the HTTPSY specification explains how
those criteria are met. Several other documents explain why all of
this is important.

Please read the provided documentation.
Then you simply did not read the documentaion.
Then do it. I asked you for the attack steps because you cannot
provide them.
No more hand-waving please. The provided documentation provides
technical detail and examples. I expect counter-arguments to do
the same.

I am happy to describe the YURL security model in your preferred
documentation format.  Ideally, if you have a link for a
description of the HTTPS security model that you find acceptable,
I will try to mimic it for HTTPSY.
Thank you,

Perry, throughout this thread, you have made a number of factually
incorrect statements about YURL. Never have you provided an
argument to backup any of these statements. I know that you are
under no obligation to make rational arguments about my work, but
I fail to see how making irrational arguments is useful to anyone.
Calling my work vomit seems even more spurious.
YURL makes key management *much* easier than it is under the PKI.
The HTTPSY specification states that:
"The client MUST construct a valid PKIX certificate path to a
certificate that is signed using a public key whose hash matches
the hash in the URL."
This means that the public key hash contained in an httpsy:// YURL
is the hash of the public key of the root certificate. Should a
subject private key be compromized, the subject certificate can be
revoked and a new public/private key pair created and certified.
All existing YURLs remain valid.
For example, the YURL for the Waterken Inc. site is:
httpsy://r4wdwfrp37ii6qzjlyklkeacbe at waterken.com/
The private key corresponding to this public key hash has never
existed on the Waterken Inc. server. Should someone hack into the
server, I can set the site back up after reclaiming control of my
Note that if you go to the Waterken Inc. site using the Waterken
Browser, the public key you will use for the connection is only
valid until Jul 26 16:50:33 2003 GMT. I only issued a certificate
for one month. At the end of the month, I will issue a new
certificate, closing the window of vulnerability for that
particular private key. All YURLs will remain valid.
I am actually practicing what I preach in the "Why use YURLs?"
document. Read it.
As Mark Miller has so completely explained, there are only two
possible sources of trust in *any* distributed system: the creator
of the URL and additional sites that will vouch for the URL.
You always know how you got the YURL, because someone has to send
it to you and you have to receive it. At the very least, you know
how you got the YURL. This establishes your initial trust
You can then amplify the trust relationship by asking another
trusted site to vouch for the YURL. In the Waterken Browser, this
is implemented through the Pet Name system. When you receive the
YURL, the browser looks it up in its database and tells you if the
target site is one you have already been introduced to. This
simple mechanism lets you combine introductions and manage trust
These principles are explained in the YURL Definition, which you
dismissed as "peripherally interesting". See:
I can make no sense of this statement.
First, a YURL doesn't claim to be anything. No URL does. The
creator of a URL makes a claim. Other sites may also make claims.
No one is being asked to remember any hashes. This has been
pointed out to you multiple times, by multiple different posters.
This is the whole point of the YURL Trust Management document.
I don't want this to be a confrontational discussion. I am
saddened that it has become one. Please stop making baseless
denigrations of my work. I am eager to receive constructive
criticism, will receive it with grace and use it to build the best
solution to our common problem. However, if you insist on calling
my work vomit, then I will defend my work with equal zeal.

@_subject: Choosing an implementation language 
Given the nature of recent, and past, bugs discovered in the
OpenSSL implementation, it makes more sense to implement in a
memory-safe language, such as python, java or squeak. Using a VM
hosted language will limit the pool of possible users, but might
create a more loyal user base.
I know the squeak community  does not have
SSL and would very much like to have it. An implementation of SSL
in squeak would also be of interest to the Squeak-E project,
related to the E project .
