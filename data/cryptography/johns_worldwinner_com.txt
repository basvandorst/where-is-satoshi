@_subject: crypto/web impementation tradeoffs 
I'm passing some data through a web client [applet-like] and am planning
on using some crypto to help ensure the data's integrity when the applet
sends it back to me after it has been processed.
The applet has the ability to encode data with several well known
symmetric ciphers.
The problem I'm having has to do with key management.
Is it better to have the key encoded in the binary, or to pass it a
plain text key as one of the parameters to the applet?
I know that the way most cryptosystems work is that the security is in
the key. But having a compiled-in key just seems like a time bomb that's
going to go off eventually. Is it better to have a variable key passed
in as data [i.e. not marked as "key"] or to have a static key that sits
there and waits to be found.

@_subject: authentication protocols 
I'd like to find an authentication protocol that fits my needs:
1. 2 [automated] parties
2. no trusted 3rd party intemediary ['Trent' in _Applied_Crypto_]
Most of the stuff in _Applied_Crypto_ requires that third party. It may
be an impossible task, nothing seems obvious to me. Pointers,
suggestions, or aphorisms all welcome.

( 02.10.02 12:50 -0500 ) Jeremey Barrett:
While I generally am on board with this, I can see a situation where the
encryption overhead [and complexity] may be excessive [underpowered mail
servers administered by beginners] compared to the gains.

( 03.06.10 01:52 -0000 ) John R. Levine:
i think this is more a problem with people than technology [crypto].
similarly, another aspect of the problem is the widespread unfamiliarity
with digital credentials. again, this part could be 'solved' by teaching
people instead of creating more technology.
nothing is foolproof. we live in a dangerous world.

bugtraq archives?
perhaps due to the sensitive nature of encrypted data, many attacks may
not be reported. and even if so, the reports may be incomplete, or

( 03.09.30 20:39 -0700 ) kent at songbird.com:
except for the fact that these holes get fixed as opposed to the other
flaws in the true monoculture computing environment [m$ windows] that
get denied, then fixed [at a later date, and with no external review of
the fix code possible].
the monoculture you refer to [ssl/ssh] is brought on by the
effectiveness of this software to allow for some measure of secure
network computing. a lot of people use it because it works.
but you're probably just trolling anyway ...

i worked at cybertrust/baltimore up until about 3 years ago [like rats
leaving a sinking ship ...].and, as you might imagine i have no idea
what's going on with those keys.
there was a big institutional fight over how much money to spend on
putting those keys in the browsers, now pretty much meaningless.  the
keys were always well watched, at least while i was there. i had to work
in that room a few times, and i was watched then too. the guy who ran
the facility [like a tight ship] left shortly after i did, so i have
even less faith in the integrity of those certs now than i would have
otherwise because his replacement probably couldn't even tell you what
TCP stands for.
but as you imply, all bets are off now.

as i understand it, the problem here was that credentials were issued by
an untrustworthy agent. you can have this scenario both online and off.
how does being online solve the problem of a compromised issuing
