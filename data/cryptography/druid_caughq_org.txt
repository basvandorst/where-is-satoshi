@_subject: New Attacks against AES-256 
Paper and details are not yet public, but Schneier provides a summary:
Basically, if AES-256 is implemented with fewer rounds than the standard
specifies (essentially the number of rounds recommended for AES-128), it
is susceptible to a number of related-key attacks.

ABSTRACT: Chaocipher is a method of encryption invented by John F. Byrne
in 1918, who tried unsuccessfully to interest the US Signal Corp and
Navy in his system. In 1954, Byrne presented Chaocipher-encrypted
messages as a challenge in his autobiography ?Silent Years?. Although
numerous students of cryptanalysis attempted to solve the challenge
messages over the years, none succeeded. Chaocipher has been a closely
guarded secret known only to a handful of persons. Following fruitful
negotiations with the Byrne family during the period 2009-2010, the
Chaocipher papers and materials have been donated to the National
Cryptologic Museum in Ft. Meade, MD. This paper presents the first full
disclosure and description of Byrne?s Chaocipher algorithm......
