@_subject: [Cryptography] Is "perfect forward secrecy" the biggest fraud 
I wouldn't rush to such conclusions. The largest number factored on an
actual quantum computer using Shor's algorithm was 21, see [1].
If you turn to adiabatic quantum computation (basically tweaked
annealing), the current record is 56153 being factored [2][3][4].
So if either Shor's algorithm can be physically scaled or specialized
quantum annealing can be used to target specific numbers (it is not as
straightforward as it may sound), it MAY change things eventually.
This shouldn't, of course, stop people from developing and testing
"quantum-resistant" algorithms. But reading IBM's PR article which
"warns" about instant breaking of all encryption and immediately
suggesting IBM's lattice-based solution - it sort of rings a completely
different bell :)

@_subject: [Cryptography] Low-order points on secp256r1? 
Hi Ondrej,
the curve y^2=x^3+ax+(b-1) where a and b are taken from secp256r1
parameters does not have a prime order. The right hand side of the
equation is the same as in secp256r1 -1 (minus one). Apparently the
research tried to validate the responses to invalid curve parameters /
points used for key exchange.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Schnorr multisignatures based on ED22519 
the cofactor for Ed25519 is l=8. The problem of "hitting" small subgroup
is easily mitigated if you clear the 3 least-significant bits of your
keys. As long as you are working with points on the curve which are
eight times multiply of the generator point (i.e. 8G, 16G, 24G ...) you
are safe.
Regarding the multisignatures - I vaguely recall there was a
blockchain-based so-called "cryptocurrency" implementation that got this
wrong and it was easy for attackers to empty many users' "wallets",
because there were only 7 (or maybe 8, doesn't matter though)
brute-force steps required to recover the private keys.
