@_subject: should you trust CAs? (Re: dual-use digital signature 
Hi Adam,
pairs should be generated by the user. But in the real world, as Ian G
points out, where businesses are trying to minimize costs and maximize
profits, it is very attractive to have the CA generate the key pair (and as
Peter G pointed, delivers the pair securely), and issue a certificate at the
same time. I hope you are not using a DOCSIS cable modem to connect to the
Internet, because that is precisely what happened with the cable modem. A
major well-known CA generated the key pair, issued the certificate and
securely delivered them to the modem manufacturer. The modem manufacturer
then injected the key pair and certificate into the modem and sold it. I
guess you can say/argue that there is a difference between a "user key pair"
and a "device key pair", and therefore, it can work for cable modems, but I
don't how you feel/think/believe in this case.
Until fairly recently, when smart card could finally generate their own key
pairs, smart cards were delivered with key pairs that were generated outside
the smart card and then injected into them for delivery to the end user.
I'm not trying to change your mind, I'm just trying to point out how the
real business world works, whether we security folks like it or not.

Hi Adam,
As far as I know, there is nothing in any standard or "good security
practice" that says you can't multiple certificate for the same email
address. If I'm willing to pay each time, Verisign will gladly issue me a
certificate with my email, I can revoke it, and then pay for another
certificate with the same email. I can repeat this until I'm bankrupt and
Verisign will gladly accept my money.
I agree with Michael H. If you trust the CA to issue a cert, it's not that
much more to trust them with generating the key pair.

@_subject: ID "theft" -- so what? 
Why do cryptography folks equate PKI with  certificates and CAs? This fallacy is a major "root cause" of the  problem IHO. Why was the term "PKI" invented in the  late 70s/early  80s (Kohnfelder's thesis?)?. Before the invention of asymmetric  cryptography, didn't those people who used symmetric cryptography  need an SKI (secret key infrastructure) to manage keys? But no one  uses the term SKI or talks about how to manage secret keys (a very  hard problem). Anytime you use any type of cryptography, you need an  "infrastructure" () to  manage your keys, whether secret or public. There are at least two  public key infrastructures that do NOT require CAs: PGP and SPKI. But  like in so many real life cases, the best technology does not always  win and we are stuck with the system that garnered the most business/ economic support.

While the SET protocol was complicated, it's failure had nothing to  do with that fact or the lack of USB on PCs. You could buy libraries  that implemented the protocol and the protocol did not require USB.  IMO, the failure had to do with time-to-market factors. In the late  90s, when ecommerce was just at it's infancy and you took the risk of  setting up a web store, were you going to wait you could integrate a  SET toolkit into you web site and until your customers had SET  wallets installed on their PCs before selling a product? Or were you  going to sell to anyone who used a web browser that supported SSL? It  was very simple economics, even if you had to pay VeriSign $400 for  your SSL certificate and pay Visa/MasterCard a higher fee.

On the contrary, merchants were (and maybe still are) being charged  MOTO (mail order/telephone order) rates for using SSL. Even SET was  going to charge MOTO rates until just before it was finalized. The  payment card companies weren't getting enough interest for SET and  decided to offer card-present rates to get more interest in SET. SSL  took off because it was free, in over 90% of the browsers (Netscape  own the browser market then), and it was easy to integrate into  shopping carts. As a merchant, basically your only cost was your  VeriSign cert.
But you are correct in that the payment card companies were in an  interesting position: on one hand they charge higher rates for using  SSL but on the other hand, the "perception" was that something more  secure than SSL was needed.
One other point, SET did NOT require certs for the consumers. The  client-merchant protocol supported clients without certs.

* (Apologies to the original poster) When the original poster  requested "passphrases with more than 160 bits of entropy", what was  he requesting?

Widely-used online "trust" authorities issue certifications without  substantial verification of the actual trustworthiness of recipients.  Their lax approach gives rise to adverse selection: The sites that  seek and obtain trust certifications are actually significantly less  trustworthy than those that forego certification. I demonstrate this  adverse selection empirically via a new dataset on web site  characteristics and safety. I find that TRUSTe-certified sites are  more than twice as likely to be untrustworthy as uncertified sites, a  difference which remains statistically and economically significant  when restricted to "complex" commercial sites. I also present  analogous results of adverse selection in search engine advertising -  finding ads at leading search engines to be more than twice as likely  to be untrustworthy as corresponding organic search results for the  same search terms.

Hi David,
As Hagai stated, welcome to the "real world". There may be standards  organization (IETF?) that do really worry about security, but in the  "real world", dead lines and existing products unfortunately  influence security decisions.
You're totally correct but it doesn't change the "reality" of the  situation. Later this week I will create a document with the  arguments sent to me and others from papers on the web and send it to  this working group of OMA so there will be an "official record" of my  objection to the decision.
No, there will be message integrity. For those of you asking, here's  a high level overview of the protocol is as follows:
1) Do a Mutual Authentication with Key Exchange
A --> B  CertChainA | ControlOptions
B --> A  CertChainB | E[PubA, RanB | ControlOptions |  ChosenOptions]  //Using RSA-OAEP
A --> B E[PubB, RandA | H[RanB]]  //SHA-1
B --> A H[RanA | RanB]
The ControlOptions includes protocol version and encryption algorithm.
2 ) Using a KDF, derive an AES-128 session encryption key SK, an HMAC- SHA-1 message integrity key MK and either a counter or IV
      Either AES-CTR or AES-CBC will be support
3) Data needing confidentiality is encrypted with the SK in the mode  selected in step 1. The message is integrity protected with MK. A new  MK is generated after a message is sent using MK(i+1) = H[MK(i)]
Hope this clarifies things somewhat.

============================== START ==============================
'Melissa' disrobes in ploy that relies on people, not CPUs, to crack  squiggly codes
October 30, 2007 (Computerworld) -- Spammers are using a virtual  stripper as bait to dupe people into helping criminals crack codes  they need to send more spam or boost the rankings of parasitic Web  sites, security researchers said today.
A series of photographs shows "Melissa," no relation to the 1999 worm  by the same name, with progressively fewer clothes and more skin each  time the user correctly enters the characters in an accompanying  CAPTCHA (Completely Automatic Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and  Humans Apart), the distorted, scrambled codes that most Web mail  services use to block bots from registering hundreds or thousands of  accounts. Spammers rely on Web e-mail accounts because they're  disposable; by the time filters have blocked the address, the spammers  throw it away and move on to another.
The CAPTCHAs that Melissa feeds to users are, in fact, legitimate  codes snatched from Yahoo Mail's signup screens, said analysts at  Trend Micro Inc. The hackers, frustrated at their inability to come up  with a way to automate account registration, are getting users to do  their dirty work.
"They're using human beings in semi-real time to translate CAPTCHAs by  proxy," said Paul Ferguson, a network architect at Trend Micro. "You  have to give them this, it's clever."
Each time the user correctly decodes the CAPTCHA, a new Melissa photo  is revealed, pulled from a hacker-controlled server in Israel,  according to Symantec Corp. The plain-text decodes are sent to that  same server, where they are presumably banked for future use in  generating large numbers of Yahoo Mail accounts.
Fumble-fingered typists are even encouraged by Melissa to try their  luck again: "Hmmm, nope, the word you entered is incorrect honey! Lets  [sic] try again?" the virtual stripper replies.
Trend Micro said the striptease was part of a Trojan horse called  CAPTCHA.a; rival Symantec dubbed it Captchar.a instead. The Trojan  horse may be part of a multistage attack, downloaded to a PC that's  been compromised by other, more malicious code, or can be encountered  as a drive-by Web-based exploit.
"This isn't the first time that they've tried to bust CAPTCHAs," said  Ferguson, noting past attempts by bot-driven malware to apply optical  character-recognition technology to deciphering the squiggles and  obscured letters. Nor is it the first time human beings have been put  to work decoding CAPTCHAs. "Work-at-home money mule schemes run by  criminals have hired people to do this same thing," Ferguson said.  "They're told to log on to this Web page and type the CAPTCHA. They  have a quota."
In some cases, those CAPTCHAs have been used to sidestep bot  protection for blog commenting rights; hackers will flood a blog  they've created with fraudulent comments to drive up its search-engine  ranking, expecting that the higher placement will translate into more  traffic and thus more clicks on the ads displayed on the blog page.  "Sometimes they use [CAPTCHAs] just to bump up their page [ranking],"  Ferguson said.
The Trojan horse can strike PCs running Windows 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP  and Server 2003.

I wrote previously in a follow-up to a thread that I vaguely remember
to have read
that in US a permission is needed for Farady shielding of rooms,
whereupon a few
readers doubted its correctness. I have just succeeded to again find the
A. Stanoyevitch, Discrete Structures with Contemporary Applications. CRC
2011. On p.301 there is:
Buildings can be fitted using a special insulation procedure that
against tempest devices, but any company or individual in the US
who has
this insulation must first obtain a license from the federal
I can't comment on the license/legality issue but there was a time, not that many years ago, that cryptography was considered as "munitions" by the US government. If you were a US citizen, you could not sell any crypto-related product outside the US without getting a license from the government. You weren't supposed to discuss cryptography outside the US either.
I do have an interesting anecdote related to Tempest (FS-1027) rooms: I used to work for a defense contractor that had a contract to install a secure computer system and network at an Air Force base. For the computers, we used Tempest rated PCs and for the network, we used a fiber optic Ethernet network. Of course, the cost was triple the regular price. The PCs were supposed to be connect to an IBM mini-computer (I forget the model). Because you couldn't buy a Tempest mini-computer, we hired a special building contractor (that had a top secret clearance) to build a Tempest room to house the mini-computer and other equipment. When the contractor had completed the work, the room was tested to make sure it didn't radiate and it would pass the Tempest regulations, which it did.
Everything was working fine until one weekend when it rained most of Saturday and Sunday. When we went to work the following Monday, most of the equipment in the Tempest room was damaged by the water that dripped on the equipment in the room. Although the Tempest room didn't radiate, it wasn't waterproof! Because it would take too much time to get the special contractor to make the room waterproof, we had to make tents out of PVC pipes and plastic tarps to cover all the equipment in the room. That way, in the future, the water would drip off to the sides and not into the equipment itself. I always wanted to take a photo of the tents but I knew they wouldn't let me.

You know by now that Internet of Things devices like your router are often vulnerable to attack, the industry-wide lack of investment in security leaving the door open to a host of abuses. Worse still, known weaknesses and flaws can hang around for years after their initial discovery. Even decades. And Monday, the content and web services firm Akamai published new findings that it has observed attackers actively exploiting a flaw in devices like routers and video game consoles that was originally exposed in 2006.

?If we reflect on the pace of evolution of the technical estate in the last 3 years and the tremendous shift of emphasis in hyperconnected business models that are increasingly reliant upon and enabled by XaaS.  We?ve seen great performance enhancements across the estate with virtualization in the server room, virtualisation in the Networks with the adoption of SDN.  As a consequence, we see ever greater adoption of services being delivered and consumed across hybrid on-prem and multi-cloud environments.  However, in this melee of innovation in the estate and the business models leveraging value from this, we have not seen the same degree of evolution, innovation even, in one of the critical enabling constructs, namely the Cryptographic model.?
