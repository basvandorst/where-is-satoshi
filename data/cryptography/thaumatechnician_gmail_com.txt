Google: Wiesner "Conjugate Coding" filetype:pdf
It's the 2nd item in  the list when I do it.  I've sent you a copy via
email; the info is posted here for everyone's benefit.  It's been added
to my reading list. :-)

Usually, but not always. 
Some years ago, Bruce Schneier recounted how shocked he was when a TSA
agent asked him, after looking at his boarding pass, "Are you THE Bruce
Schneier"? 
(That agent must have hired by accident.)

Interesting: although the link in the text of the message says:
The HTML portion of your message's clickable link goes to:
and the NY Mag's web server is case-sensitive....  Sigh. (It took me a minute or two to see it.)
Bruce always posts a copy of his published essays on his blog, and this
one, minus the click-baity title, is available here:

While I'd agree about the 'slot antenna (because of the length of the
slot), a Faraday cage doesn't need to be a perfect, seamless enclosure
to work. Quoting from a Gamry Instruments' web page: "the penetration of EM
radiation is limited to oscillations that have wavelengths shorter than
twice the diameter of the opening.  So a 1 cm opening allows 2 cm and
shorter wavelengths, which correspond to 150+ GHz noise."  A missing
small screw's hole, say 3mm diameter, would pass through some 500GHz or
shorter/faster wavelengths but still block all the lower frequencies.
A Faraday cage made out of metal mosquito screens would be plenty fine
for almost all computers.  I've seen some enclosing high-security
government rooms or parts of rooms.  In their case, the screen's
material was copper.  Pure, fingerprint-covered copper.

If you really need to have one...:
The Corsair uses a 4-10 digit PIN with a 5-character character set,
giving 12,206,875 possible PINs.  The "Built-in hacking detection locks
device for 2 minutes after 5 failed attempts".   Just rinse, repeat. This guy -  - claims he can crack it.
In contrast, the Kingston DataTraveler 2000, which at least is FIPS 197
certified, uses a 7-15 digit PIN with a ten-character character set,
giving 1,111,111,110,000,000 possible PINs.  After ten failed attempts,
it deletes the stored PIN, the AES key, then wipes the flash, returning
it to the blank state it was when it left the factory.

You should check out some of the Eastern Europeans selling Felix
arithmometers on eBay. 
They might have Soviet knockoffs of Voight-Kampff machines on hand,
cheap.  They might be modifiable. :->
