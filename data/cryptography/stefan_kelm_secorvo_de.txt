Well, this article is somewhat blurry. They start by
"Hoping to block the entry of criminals and terrorists"
whereas even immigration officers agree that that's not
one of their goals.
Fortunately, they then cite some politician:
"When it's all in place, there's still no real additional
security or at least it's of marginal value" which is, as
we all know, correct.
BTW, on some airports DHS does indeed take one's fingerprint
and photos when leaving the country. They currently do so
at Baltimore for example.
What worries me is that all the information collected
can be, and will be, misused eventually.
What worries me even more is that the europeans now
feel under pressure and happily will introduce the
very same crap.

@_subject: [Clips] The summer of PKI love 
On that subject I highly recommend a report very recently
published by DFN-CERT and SurfNET.
   :
  Abstract
The usage of X.509 certificates and related PKI techniques is getting   more and more common. It enables users to sign and encrypt messages, to   use secure communication channels for internet communication and to   authenticate themselves to all kind of network services. The overall   level of security for the usage of public key cryptography depends   heavily on that of the private key, which is usually installed on the   local host of the user. This poses not only a security risk but it does also restrict the increasing user demand for mobility. A solution to these problems can be smart cards and USB-tokens, which store private keys in such a way that they cannot be retrieved from these. Instead data can be send to these devices and is being processed, decrypted or signed, by the device itself and only then the results are provided by these devices for further processing.  These devices are very promising for the widespread usage of PKI. In a PC-
dominated world the USB-tokens have the advantage, that no additional reader is necessary to use them even on foreign hosts. Both types of devices, smart cards and USB-tokens, still need support by the underlying operating systems and by the used applications. This makes it very difficult to decide which token may be successfully used in any given environment and will meet the demands of the applications and indented usage. This report tries to ease the decision process when selecting a token for a particular environment and platform.  For this purpose a number of the available tokens were tested together with the most common applications on the most commonly used operating systems. A reproduceable test framework was established to ensure the comparability and re-usability of these tests.  Overall it is safe to say in a homogenous environment with commonly used applications the tested tokens perform well. Nevertheless rolling out tokens on a large scale is still not something to be undertaken on a  friday afternoon.

@_subject: Deal on EU data retention law  
Deal on EU data retention law
The European Parliament adopted today by 378 votes in favour, 197
against and 30 abstentions a directive on data retention in first
reading. The final text negotiated beforehand with the Council aims to
facilitate judicial co-operation in criminal matters by approximating
Member States' legislation on the retention of data processed by
telecommunications companies.
The directive covers traffic and location data generated by telephony,
SMS and internet, but not the content of the information communicated.
The new EU law will help national authorities to track down possible
criminals and terrorists by granting them access to a list of all
telephone calls, SMS or Internet connections made by suspects during the
previous few months.  The amendments finally adopted were a compromise
between the PES and EPP groups with the Council and differed in some key
points to the draft directive adopted initially by the Civil Liberties
Committee.  The GUE, Greens and UEN groups and some members from the
ALDE group voted against the directive in the final vote.  Alexander
Nuno ALVARO (ALDE, DE) was unhappy with the result of the compromise
adopted and withdrew his name as rapporteur.
Limited access to data
In the final text adopted, Parliament is proposing a number of
amendments to the Commission text to restrict the use of retained data
and ensure that the future law fully respects the privacy of the
telephone and internet users.
On the aim of the directive, MEPs agree with the need to retain data for
the detection, investigation and prosecution of crime, but only for
?specified forms? of serious criminal offences (terrorism and organised
crime), and not for the mere ?prevention? of all kinds of crime.  MEPs
feel that the concept of prevention is too vague and could lead to abuse
of the system from national authorities.
The directive will provide for data to be retained by the
telecommunications companies for a minimum of six months and a maximum
of 24.  MEPs also added a provision for ?effective, proportionate and
dissuasive? penal sanctions for companies who fail to store the data or
misuse the retained information.
Only the competent authorities determined by Member States should have
access to the retained data from phone or internet providers.
Furthermore, each national government will designate an independent
authority responsible for monitoring the use of the data.
MEPs also establish that access to retained data should be limited to
specific purpose and on a case by case basis (push system): each time,
the authorities would need to request to the telecom company that the
data related to a concrete suspect, instead of having granted access to
the whole database.
As for the type of data to be retained, MEPs finally supported the
registration of location data on calls, SMS and internet use, including
unsuccessful calls.  This point was controversial due to the fact that
telecom companies do not currently register lost calls for billing
purposes and so to do this using new technologies would be expensive.
Spanish MEPs strongly supported the Council position to include the
retention of unsuccessful calls, since the terrorist attacks in Madrid
were prosecuted thanks to the investigation of specific lost calls from
mobile phones.
Who foots the bill?
Finally, MEPs decided to delete the paragraph in which it was mandatory
for Member States to reimburse telecom companies for all additional
costs of retention, storage and transmission of data.  In the draft
directive adopted by the Civil Liberties Committee, MEPs had initially
called for the full reimbursement of costs.

10 Feb 2005
Today, cryptographers Serge Mister and Robert Zuccherato from Entrust released a paper outlining an attack on the way OpenPGP does symmetric cryptography. They have been kind enough to give the OpenPGP community advance notice of their paper, and it is thus the subject of this CTO Corner article, which I'm writing in cooperation with David Shaw of Gnu Privacy Guard (GnuPG), Brian Smith of Hush Communications, Derek Atkins of the OpenPGP Working Group, and Phil Zimmermann. In it, we'll discuss:
 - What this discovery means to OpenPGP users
 - Details of the attack and how it works
 - What software and standards developers are doing about it We in the OpenPGP community feel strongly about the quality of our work and appreciate the trust the world places in us. OpenPGP is arguably the most used and most relied-upon cryptosystem for messages and files. Consequently, it is our obligation to describe any problems with the standard and proposed resolution of those problems.

We've been discussing those very same topics within Europe for
many years now. When some EU Member States (Germany, Austria, ...)
already had very stringent signature laws the EU was kind of
forced to act. They tried to enact a signature directive which
they thought would be as technology neutral as possible. And
although that approach seemed to be a good one they failed:
they were overambitious wrt certain issues, what's more the
implementation of the directive into national legislation
lead to 20+ different EU signature laws:

as well as focussing on practical applications:

Here in Europe, e-invoicing very slowly seems to be
becoming a (or should I say "the"?) long-awaited
application for (qualified) electronic signatures.
Since electronic invoices need to be archived in
most countries some vendors apply time-stamps and
recommend to re-apply time-stamps from time to time.

By using pseudonyms within the certificate's common name. This
is not only done in Germany but in other countries as well.
Even CAs (and, at least in Germany, the root CA) are being
issued qualified certificates, thus they need to use
pseudonyms. The timestamping service by Deutsche Post, e.g.,
has a qualified certificate with the following DN:
Subject DN         : CN  = TSS DP Com 31:PN
                     OU  = Signtrust
                     O   = Deutsche Post Com GmbH
                     C   = DE
potentially much more expensive, though.

Point taken.  :)  However, there are other countries w/ similar rules.
There's another EU Diretive on "simplifying, modernising and harmonising
the conditions laid down for invoicing in respect of value added tax".
   Invoices sent by electronic means shall be accepted
   by Member States provided that the authenticity of
   the origin and integrity of the contents are guaranteed:
   - by means of an advanced electronic signature
     within the meaning of Article 2(2) of Directive
     1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 13 December 1999 on a
     Community framework for electronic signatures;
     Member States may however ask for
     the advanced electronic signature to be based on
     a qualified certificate and created by a secure-signature-
     creation device, within the meaning of
     Article 2(6) and (10) of the aforementioned
     Directive;"
That's the one I was talking about earlier. eInvoicing
slowly seems to take off in a few european countries.
I have no idea as to how this Directive has been
transposed into UK law, though.

Addition (
Scientists at the Ruhr-Universit?t Bochum[1] have defeated the Keeloq[2]
immobiliser and door opener used in many cars. Attackers need only
intercept two transmissions between the transmitter and receiver in
order to clone the digital key and gain access to the car. Microchip
Technology's RFID-based KeeLoq process, is used in automobiles
manufactured by Chrysler, Daewoo, Fiat, General Motors, Honda, Toyota
(Lexus), Volvo, Volkswagen and Jaguar. KeeLoq is also used in building
access systems and garage door openers. Signal interception is possible
at a range of 100 metres, according to Professor Christof Paar of the
School of Electronics and Information Technology. In addition to gaining
unauthorised access, the systems can be manipulated, denying the
rightful owners access.
Both the KeeLoq transmitter and receiver encrypt their signals. A
proprietary, non-linear encryption algorithm is used which encrypts
controller commands with a unique code before transmission to the
vehicle. A 32 bit initialisation vector together with a 32 bit hopping
code is used as a key. An ID unique to each electronic key is added to
the calculation.
But there is also a manufacturer's master key for all of the products in
a series. This is precisely what Professor Paar's Bochum group was able
to retrieve using a procedure known as side channel analysis. To obtain
the master key the researchers used differential power analysis (DPA)
and differential electromagnetic analysis (DEMA) at both the transmitter
and receiver during the transmission. Once the master key is known, only
two transmissions are needed in order to obtain the crypto key of a
particular KeeLoq remote control. The vulnerability was tested on
commercial systems, according the Bochum scientists.
In early February the researchers presented a detailed description[3] of
the attack that required them to intercept a number of activation
procedures in order to obtain the manufacturer's key. At the CRYPTO 2007
cryptography conference, an international group of researchers presented
a method by which the individual keys could be cracked[4] using
distributed computing.

We've been helping the German "Toll Collect" system (as

@_subject: [heise online UK] Secure deletion: a single overwrite will do it 
The myth that to delete data really securely from a hard disk you have
to overwrite it many times, using different patterns, has persisted for
decades, despite the fact that even firms specialising in data recovery,
openly admit that if a hard disk is overwritten with zeros just once,
all of its data is irretrievably lost.
Craig Wright, a forensics expert, claims to have put this legend finally
to rest. He and his colleagues ran a scientific study to take a close
look at hard disks of various makes and different ages, overwriting
their data under controlled conditions and then examining the magnetic
surfaces with a magnetic-force microscope. They presented their paper at
ICISS 2008 and it has been published by Springer AG in its Lecture Notes
in Computer Science series (Craig Wright, Dave Kleiman, Shyaam Sundhar
R. S.: Overwriting Hard Drive Data: The Great Wiping Controversy).
They concluded that, after a single overwrite of the data on a drive,
whether it be an old 1-gigabyte disk or a current model (at the time of
the study), the likelihood of still being able to reconstruct anything
is practically zero. Well, OK, not quite: a single bit whose precise
location is known can in fact be correctly reconstructed with 56 per
cent probability (in one of the quoted examples). To recover a byte,
however, correct head positioning would have to be precisely repeated
eight times, and the probability of that is only 0.97 per cent.
Recovering anything beyond a single byte is even less likely.
Nevertheless, that doesn't stop the vendors of data-wiping programs
offering software that overwrites data up to 35 times, based on
decades-old security standards that were developed for diskettes.
Although this may give a data wiper the psychological satisfaction of
having done a thorough job, it's a pure waste of time.
Something much more important, from a security point of view, is
actually to overwrite all copies of the data that are to be deleted. If
a sensitive document has been edited on a PC, overwriting the file is
far from sufficient because, during editing, the data have been saved
countless times to temporary files, back-ups, shadow copies, swap files
... and who knows where else? Really, to ensure that nothing more can be
recovered from a hard disk, it has to be overwritten completely, sector
by sector. Although this takes time, it costs nothing: the dd command in
any Linux distribution will do the job perfectly.
