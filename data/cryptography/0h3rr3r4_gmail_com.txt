To those interested,
I'm including the code of a little scheme for key exchange similar to a DH
Key exchange process. Under this scheme, where Alice and Bob exchange some
numbers that are produced and then recombined by an iterative function that
is based on simple bit-wise operations, Eve has to figure out a way to find
ant test efficiently pairs of inputs to the core function of this scheme
(different combinations of inputs result can produce the same result but
you require the same inputs to perform the final combination that provide
Alice and Bob with the same key at the end of the process.
I'm not making any claims regarding the security of this system, but I
believe it can be interesting to spark some discussion about alternatives
to current key exchange schemes and their associated mathematical problems.
More details and demo source code (in C) is available here:
A sample of the output of the demo source code (which should compile
without modification in any Linux system) is provided here:
