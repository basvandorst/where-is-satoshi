By the way, OpenSSL has always included patented algorithms such as RSA and
IDEA, together with warnings about patent issues in the documentation and
compile time switches to disable algorithms that are known to be patented.
In that sense, OpenSSL as a whole has never been "free software". The
licensing terms for IDEA actually are way more restrictive than those for
Sun's ECC code, and nobody has complained about that so far - because many
people find that code useful, and the others just disable it.

Correct. We'll take care of that before 0.9.8 is released - promised.
