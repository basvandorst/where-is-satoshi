@_subject: Annoucement: Initial release of Poindexter is available 
I'm pleased to announce the initial release of Poindexter.
Poindexter is a Java applet that provides the basic four functions of PGP plus:
* It runs locally and does not require an internet connection
* It (theoretically) runs on any platform with a working Java Plug-in
* It's small enough to fit on a floppy disk along with your keys
* In limited testing, it interoperates with GnuPG and PGP 8
* Available source code
Poindexter has many weaknesses but the major ones are:
* Relies on the Java Plug-in
* Requires that Java security be crippled in order to run.
* It uses the Cryptix OpenPGP [1] libraries. These libraries are not yet fully-baked
* It doesn't run out of the box due to java policy restrictions
* Passwords and keys can probably be harvested from memory on shared * Password input is not shielded
* No Web of Trust functions
With Poindexter I'm trying to fill a need that Tinfoil Hat Linux [2] doesn't quite cover. Namely, users who want/need portable crypto but are not technical enough to use Tinfoil.
Please try out this software and let me know what your feelings are on it and it's purpose.
