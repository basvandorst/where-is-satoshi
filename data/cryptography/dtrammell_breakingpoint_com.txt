@_subject: SHA-1 collisions now 2^52 
"Until now, the best complete differential path (to our knowledge)
has complexity 2^63
The new path presented has complexity 2^52 - a significant reduction.
Practical collisions are within resources of a well funded organisation.
We are continuing our search for differential paths where the
boomerang attack can be used with maximum effect.
Paper will appear on eprint soon."

@_subject: MD5 considered harmful today, SHA-1 considered harmful tomorrow 
Nearly everything I've seen regarding the proposed solutions to this
attack have involved migration to SHA-1.  SHA-1 is scheduled to be
decertified by NIST in 2010, and NIST has already recommended[1] moving
away from SHA-1 to SHA-2 (256, 512, etc.).  Collision attacks have
already been demonstrated[2] against SHA-1 back in 2005, and if history
tells us anything then things will only get worse for SHA-1 from here.
By not moving directly to at least SHA-2 (until the winner of the NIST
hash competition is known), these vendors are likely setting themselves
up for similar attacks in the (relatively) near future.
