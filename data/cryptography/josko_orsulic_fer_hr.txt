@_subject: SPKI/SDSI Intellectual Property Issues? 
Are there any intellectualy property issues in regard to implementing Nothing is mentioned in the RFCs or on the IETF Page of Intellectual Property Rights Notices. I've searched for any reference to this, but nothing definite came up.
That would lead to the conclusion that SPKI/SDSI are free of patent and other IP claims. If this is true, commercial implementatons of SPKI/SDSI technologies should be possible without licensing them, can anyone confirm this?
Thanks and best regards,
