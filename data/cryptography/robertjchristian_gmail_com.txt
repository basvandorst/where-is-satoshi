?It also might be possible to refactor and restructure Bitcoin to separate
out the key new idea, a decentralized, global, irreversible transaction
This was referred to sometime back in 2008, shortly after Satoshi announced the first release of BitCoin.  Is anyone aware if this is being worked on?

What?s to stop someone from gaming the system and creating millions of wallets, increasing their odds of accidental deposits?  If nothing else you could conceive of a DOS attack of sorts, where the addresses are all burned up.  This seems like a major flaw to me.

Not saying "generating every key pair and
storing it". Saying generating a sufficient number of keypairs...
Thing is, I haven't seen a collision resolution strategy... just a general
sentiment that "there is an extremely low possibility for collision."
1) Understood that IDs are a hash.  I guess I wasn't very articulate in the
initial question because it seems as if the responses so far are answering
other questions, such as "what if someone just tried to spoof an address"
or "what if someone tried to create all possible key value pairs and store
them" ... I am not asking either of those questions (but closer to the
2) I am pointing out that addresses are finite, and 34 chars long... They
can only be upper or lower case, or 0..9.  So at the end of the day, after
all the fancy stuff, the number of all possible bitcoin addresses
is (26*2+10)^34 possible unique ids.
So the number of possible unique addresses is actually relatively smalll.
 Right?
I understand that to use the address you need to have generated the keypair
prior/same time.
But you don't need to create *every* possible keypair... Just enough
keypairs such that the hash output represents enough unique hashes to
represent a small fraction of the unique ids.  Then you'll start seeing
So my question is "what am a missing with respect to thinking we'll start
to see collisions happening at a rate that makes the system cost
If we get past that point the question is "what is the hash resolution
And if we got past that one, and with no solution... Then the question is
why is Bitcoin trading at $650 per USD?  :)
I  am sure I am missing something here... Haven't found it yet though...

Exactly my point.  What's the collision resolution strategy and why isn't
this a scary proposition?

Regarding the liquidity trap concern:
Here is a worst case scenario:
M2 Monetary Supply is 66 trillion. If it all moved to BitCoin, each coin would be worth 3.1 million dollars.
Math: 66000000000000/21000000 = $3,142,857
One Satoshi is the smallest possible denomination of BitCoin at 0.00000001 of a BitCoin.
If all of M2 moved into BitCoins, each Satoshi would be worth 3142857*0.00000001 = .03, or three cents. And since the M2 supply is increasing at around 6% per year, all else being equal, a Satoshi would reduce to a penny in about 20 years. Math: (1.06)^19 = 3
This is simplistic and extreme, but points out that the sheer numbers required to cause concern over the 21 million dollar cap just aren't there for the foreseeable future.
If this isn?t enough to address the deflationary effect , consider that BitCoin is just a single form of Crypto Currency. It?s very plausible that a second alt coin, possibly an inflationary one, will be used in addition to BitCoin. Where BitCoin would serve as more of a store of value, and an alternate coin would serve as every day cash. In fact, this is already being experimented with today.
Regarding calling it an investment:
People are trying to make sense of something we?ve never seen before in history. This is a new invention. And it is money by definition. There?s no more ?if? when you can use it to purchase goods, gamble, and settle debts. We?re already at this point.
It can be seen as an investment from the perspective of ?If I spend US $1,000 on BitCoin today, I might make a 2x return by end of year.? But it?s very short sided trying to compare it to an equity. As mentioned above, it makes more sense to look at in terms of ?how much of the overall money supply will be made up of bitcoin?? Today it?s 10 Billion US dollars and growing. That's nothing to scoff at.
Crypto-currency is an invention first and foremost. And at this point we are engaging in an experiment. That?s why it?s risky. We don?t know.
Regarding calling it a bubble:
A bubble is ?A theory that security prices rise above their true value and will continue to do so until prices go into free fall and the bubble bursts.? To call it a bubble means that you must have a tangible grasp on its true value.
Nobody knows what the true value is, but we know that:
- As of this posting, BitCoin exchanges with the US dollar at around $750 per coin.
- You can use it today to buy a grilled cheese sandwich and a haircut in Seattle, and coffee in San Francisco
- You can also use it today to buy computers online, houses, cars, and to bet on sports, play poker, etc.
- As much as Bitcoin can be volatile, it is still very attractive as a store of wealth for citizens of countries whose governments are destroying their local currencies. This is already happening today.
The network affect is already here. People want to use it, and it?s adoption rate is exponential. If BitCoin saw only a 1% adoption worldwide, each coin would be valued at $31,000 US dollars. From that perspective, it?s a deal today at $750 per coin.
The point being, you can?t call it a bubble unless you can identify what its value should be. Regarding comparisons to Beanie Babies and Tulips:
Bitcoin is a currency that is easier and faster to transact on a large scale than anything else in existence. It's not a collectable. This comparison is simply misguided.
Regarding "It's too complex for the average citizen to understand and secure against getting hacked/swindled":
Very true today, but today this is less true than it was three years ago. The ecosystem around BitCoin and Crypto-currency in general is growing rapidly, and backed by leading venture capitalists investing in startups, big banks, and big technology companies like IBM. The issues around ease of use will dissolve in a relatively short amount of time. And hacking will always be a problem, just like bank robberies and muggings will always exist. As these issues are diminished over the coming years, we'll see more mainstream adoption.
What I think the real issues are:
Issues in the underlying architecture, including the ability to replace existing crypto algorithms, the 51% attack, transaction time as Bitcoin scales, and potential issues with address collision. But these can be solved over time within Bitcoin, or another alt coin.
Political issues like taxation, cross-border exchanges, and central governance. This is the biggest can of worms, but not the type of problem we should call unsolvable. In fact these concepts may very well be reinvented and evolved in a better way. My point here is that just because it doesn't fit into an existing framework doesn't mean it won't work. This is a problem that great inventions commonly encounter, and not a de-facto deal-breaker.
In summary
This is a new invention, and directly addresses many issues we have with today's mediums of exchange. It can be compared to many things, but it is not any of them. It's an experiment, and an exciting one at that.
Today it represents .015% of the world's currency. The question we ought to be asking is, what will that number look like in 2014, 2015, and the foreseeable future?

Edit:  There are only 58 possible characters.  0OlI are excluded from the set to avoid being misread.  and there are a few characters within the address used for version and checksum.

Hi Sanjeet,
A paper on block chain technology and crypto-currencies would likely be very interesting as well.
Good luck!
