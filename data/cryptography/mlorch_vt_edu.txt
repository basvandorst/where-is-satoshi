I've played around with the IBM 2058 eServer Cryptographic Accelerator
using it on Linux 2.4 with an OpenSSL engine supplied by IBM as an
open source project
see and It has 5 UltraCypher processors on board and the OpenSSL
speed command reports up to 60 times as many RSA operations/sec
than the OpenSSL software only implementation on an Intel Xeon 2.4GHz
Hope this helps
