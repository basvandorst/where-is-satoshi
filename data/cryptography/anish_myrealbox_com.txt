The analysis of Bernstein's NFS by Arjen  Lenstra, Adi Shamir, Jim
Tomlinson, Eran Tromer  has been put up on cryptosavy.com
seems interesting it comes from  Lenstra and Shamir .Lenstra lead the 1994
factorisation of RSA 129.The abstract ....
Abstract. In [1], Bernstein proposed a circuit-based implementation of
the matrix step of the number field sieve factorization algorithm. We
show that under the non-standard cost function used in [1], these circuits
indeed o
er an asymptotic improvement over other methods but
to a lesser degree than previously claimed: for a given cost, the new
method can factor integers that are 1.17 times larger (rather than 3.01).
We also propose an improved circuit design based on a new mesh routing
algorithm, and show that for factorization of 1024-bit integers the
matrix step can, under an optimistic assumption about the matrix size,
be completed within a day by a device that costs a few thousand dollars.
We conclude that from a practical standpoint, the security of RSA relies
exclusively on the hardness of the relation collection step of the number
field sieve.

Hi All,
  I hope that those who talk aloud ,especially against the powerful survive. Else the technology which was supposed to give democracy the boost - Internet would be crushed -by the forces who believe that voices of dissent should be silenced.
 To add to the injury would be the death of open source and may be the opennes that allowed the computers to develop into what they are now.

Hi Perry,
  It seems that all on the list might have read "A Cost-Based Security Analysis of Symmetric and Asymmetric Key Lengths" by Robert D. Silverman :-)
and have similiar lines of thought.Or may be they are just too bored of this...
  BTW I did try to get hold of Nicko's old costing analysis which he claimed to have made on the list when the discussion was on  Bernstein ,but with no luck.

I find it odd that there has been so little comment on TWIRL. One
would think that the crushing of 512 bit RSA keys and a strong
demonstration of the weakness of 1024 bit RSA keys would have provoked
some comment on the list.
Any comments on why no one commented?

@_subject: Microsoft: Palladium will not limit what you can run 
Hi all,
  I would be really glad to know more on Pallidium .I have tried to get some info but havent been able to get much.
 I would be really thankful if some one could give me some pointers.This is inspite of having sat through two lectures one from Graeme Proudler(H.P. Research Labs),and Fabien Petitcolas ( Microsoft research , the title of the talk was ,A brief overview of Palladium ).
 thanks in advance

Hi all,
 I thought I should add one more piece of information; it didn't say which
conference it was. It is Indocrypt 2004

International meet on cryptology in Chennai
Search for More News
 Chennai, Dec 19: A three-day international conference on cryptology will
get underway here tomorrow with the aim of providing secure communication
to the business and military sectors.
Over 140 researchers in the field, including some from abroad, would
participate in the conference, Dr M S Vijyaraghavan, executive director,
Society for Electronics Transactions and Security (SETS), told reporters
here today.
Cryptography is the art of providing secure information over insecure
channels. It encodes texts and provides a method of decoding. Cryptanalysis
is the art of breaking into cryptographic information.
The new science - cryptology - was a study of both, he said.
India had not made any headway in cryptology, he said and added that the
conference would help develop this in a big way.
President A P J Abdul Kalam would address the participants through video
conferencing. Dr R Chidambaram, principal scientific adviser, Government of
India, would inaugurate the conference. (Our Correspondent)

@_subject: EAX and CCM code 
Hi all,
  I am trying to create some test vectors for EAX and CCM mode ( using AES). Could someone point me to implementations (atleast two), if possible without assembly code.
