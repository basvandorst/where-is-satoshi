@_subject: [free-sklyarov] Please make stable NON-US homes for strong crypto projects (fwd) 
lemuria.org has stood strong against the DeCSS censorship, and I am in
the position of working at the provider. complaints, even faxes from
the cops, arrive in the room next to mine. :)
I can take copies of anything that needs a home. I can't play
maintainer or invest much time as I'm already stretched thin, but I
hereby offer lemuria.org as an archive site.
please contact me directly if you need anything mirrored.
