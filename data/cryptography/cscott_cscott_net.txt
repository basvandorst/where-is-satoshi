The black-box testing would obviously be the mistake.  How can you tell that the library doesn't start sending plain-text for messages which start with a particular magic bytes, or some other evilness?  You can't hope to test *all* messages.  The word 'exhaustively' is where your example goes I'll play Ben's part and claim that if you can provide a library which will *only* be checked using black-box testing, it's much easier to skip the whole MD5 aspect and have it use a covert channel (leak key bits in padding or some such) or transmit plain-text after the first 100M of data encrypted or some such.  There are lots of easy ways to get your maliciousness past a black-box test.  The use of MD5 (a relatively *hard* way to be malicious) doesn't appreciably change the threat.

[it should be noted that any security-conscious tester will/ought to screen your binary for all of the *published* MD5 collisions, so you'll have to generate one yourself if you want to get away with this.]

PGP has this issue with 'clear-signed' output.  An excerpt from the pgp
man page:
    If CLEARSIG is enabled, then when signing and ASCII-armoring a text
    file, PGP uses a different format that includes the plaintext in
    human-readable form.  Lines beginning with "-" are quoted with "- ".
    To cope with some of the stupider mailers in the world, lines
    beginning with "From"  are also quoted, and trailing whitespace on
    lines is stripped.  PGP will remove the quoting if you use it to
    decrypt the message, but the trailing whitespace is not recovered.
    This is still useful enough to be enabled by default.
You might find more details about typical mailer-munging from the PGP docs
or source.

googling 'dell keylogger' certainly turns up a lot of sites who insist that this is a hoax.
Um, be suspicious of keyboard changes?  Bring your own if you're paranoid?
Remove any "harmless" extension cables that suddenly attach themselves?
Most server-class hardware already has 'tamper-detection' hardware that will warn you if the machine has been opened, which should cover the "internal keylogger" case...
