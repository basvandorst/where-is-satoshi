I think it is important to separate use of hashes in the human space and
Last week I rewrote my entire crypto layer that I use on top of .NET using
fingerprints as the key identification system. Every X.509v3 cert uses the
fingerprint as the key identifier for both subject key identifiers and
authority, the fingerprint is used as the label on the key store and so on.
This has allowed be to remove about 1000 lines of code that were just there
to find keys.
For users, the only operation they are expected to do is compare two
fingerprints for equality. And usually they are just checking their own
fingerprint which should not change.
The medium term objective is to get rid of the fingerprint in base32
encoding and use something more easily recognized by a human. For example
base65536 encoding with words or images as the symbols. Let us say we could
curate a database of such images and store them on a server in a Merkle
tree form. We can now generate pictographic representations of the
fingerprint. So it should be easy to do the verification on a watch or the

What I was playing about with was actually similar. To generate my profile,
I was running the profile generator lots of times and looking for keys with
the strings 'phill', 'hallam', 'phb', etc in the profile. Some folk have
done the same with bitcoin handles.
Now for in person key validation, I am thinking that these days any process
is likely to involve QRCodes and smartphones. But that is a separate
