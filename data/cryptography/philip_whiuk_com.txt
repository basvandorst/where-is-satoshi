@_subject: [Cryptography] PRISM PROOF Email 
Let me just see if I get where you're going:
So essentially you've increased the number of CAs to the number of companies without really solving the PRISM problem. The sheer number mean it's impractical to do much more than a cursory check before approval.
PRISM for email is bad because we don't even know who we can trust. I can't trust the provider because they could have been served an NSL. The provider has to see the metadata or they can't route the email. So I'm doomed. Best case is I can secure the contents and use an alternate name. At that point I need an organization I trust to act as my Omnibroker who for some reason I don't trust with the mail itself.
One other question: PPE = Prism Proof Email?
Nor do I think key chain length was the problem - initial key authentication and distribution is the first issue.

Encryption, probably not. And without knowing the exact method of spear-phishing, signed email might not have helped.
For example if the spear-phished email looked like it came from hillary at clinton.com but wasn't PGP/SMIME signed by her, then if she always signed her emails you'd know it wasn't from her.
You could do something similar with SPF of course. Lack of SPF deployment should be a massive red-flag against a domain IMO.
Algorithms to protect against SPAM and heuristics like the above could do a lot of damage to spear-phishing attempts.  If you got an email from LinkedIn but it wasn't S/MIME signed by LinkedIn, you'd be able to say "well it's probably somebody trying to spear-phish my LinkedIn".
For the case of John Podesta, well, stuff like XOAUTH2 is starting to hit popular email providers (Hotmail, Yahoo and GMail now all deploy it). That goes a good way to help killing passwords.
It's not going to be a silver bullet but we could do better.

I think P H-B is talking about the stuff on Wikileaks, not the emails related to Benghazi that the FBI and the committees saw. Certainly she would have decrypted the Benghazi stuff for them.
I'm not convinced he's right anyway - I don't think the Wikileaks stuff made that much difference to the result especially when compared to more emotive issues like NAFTA, the Wall and so on.
