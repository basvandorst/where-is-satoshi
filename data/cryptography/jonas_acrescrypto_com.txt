If a "mining tax" could be successfully imposed, that seems like it could undermine the credibility of a blockchain. For instance, if a government could impose a tax to make mining very expensive for everyone and then run their own tax-exempt pools or give exemptions to third parties who do as they're told, it seems to me they could effectively control >50% of the hash rate very cheaply.
