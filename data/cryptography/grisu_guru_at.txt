Nobody knows, what the blackberry does with the decrypted data. The whole device is a black-box, so it is able to do anything it is programmed for, with all the data transmitted to it.

Even if an organisation has a need/right to look into people's email, it is necessary to protect the communication on transport and storage. Of course a certain way of key recovery has to be in place.
Just my 2 cents

I would tend to agree for environments with very high regulations, where the need to comply with regulations is more important than the need to keep data confidential.
I would suggest to balance that for every organisation. The risk to disclosure is much higher if data is stored unprotected. Any admin with access to the file system is able to read it.
Maybe this could be a cultural difference between US and Europe, the regulative pressure in US is higher, in Europe the privacy is more important or more protected.
I agree that both ways may be the right implementation for an organisation, but this has to be a management decision, balancing the needs.
Best regards

I tried 24 randomly generated characters. With Scripblocker you are able to paste it and got an error ?Space character is not allowed?, but there was no space.

Hi all!
I just want to bring your attention to this project. If you want to collect some buzzwords for your next bullshit-bingo, here you will find them:

@_subject: [Cryptography] how to encrypt for the very long term? 
I love this example because it shows principle limitations of cryptography and information security as a hole.
Ultimate security can only be reached through infinity efforts.
In this example:
To securely store 1 GB of data, you use a 1 GB key that will use a 1 GB key to be securely stored and so on.
Just my few cents

Hi Philip!
Perfect encryption is correct, also that perfect encryption is NOT enough for security. For integrity purposes, other means my also apply, or use cryptographic methods to detect alteration, but that is not encryption, or only partially.
You can put all these together in one application, but the functions and the methods you use, be separate.
Kindest regards
