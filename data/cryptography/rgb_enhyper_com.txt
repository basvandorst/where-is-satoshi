Hello folks,
I am doing a presentation on the future of security,
which of course includes a component on cryptography.
That will be given at this conference on payments
systems and security: Would anyone there have any good predictions on how
cryptography is going to unfold in the next few years
or so?  I have my own ideas, but I would love
to see what others see in the crystal ball.

Many thanks to the list members who have contributed ideas to the above -
I'll share the results by previewing the paper in the next few weeks if I
Having been a devotee of the financial crypto community for many years, a
thought has just occurred to me about the possible use of Systemics
Ricardian Contract idea as a practical implementation of a distributed
access control mechanism.
I came across Akanti  - augmented x509 certs
used as access control tokens in a distributed environment. It seems that
this problem space is similar to the fincrypto domain.
Proprietary non-human readable binary/ascii formats have arguably lost
ground to human readable name/value pair formats (i.e. XML and before that
IATA), so it would seem a logical progression to extend Herr Grigg's
Ricardian ontology to include a DAC "contract"?

I'm afraid I concur - my personal experience of being a security architect for
a major merchant bank was one of meeting regulatory requirement by post development "due
diligence", or as my wife calls it "nagging", making the role effectively that of  "grumpy rubber stampers"
