If PGP, Inc was going after all seventeen users of gnupg and trying to
convert them, you'd be right.  I have the feeling however, that the PGP
crowd would actually like people to use their product.
For all the whining from the 'free beer' crowd, no one had bothered to make
PGP/gnupg compatible with OSX and Windoze XP.  Looks like PGP Inc was trying
to fill a hole in the market by doing just that.
If you're running Debian Potato, have more time than money or sense, and
think PGP is worthless, why consider buying it?  You shouldn't: you'd be
crazy to do so.
If you want a product that works and is designed with mere mortals in mind,
then PGP is probably for you.

It's nice to see someone 'discovering' what Lucky Green already figured-out
years ago.  I wonder if they'll cut him a check.
