@_subject: NTT/Mitsubishi release Camilla, ESIGN, EPOC 
============================== START ==============================
NTT and Mitsubishi will be granting royalty free licenses for strict
implementations of Camilla (128bit block cipher), EPOC (public-key
encryption provably secure given its assumptions), PSEC (same but for
elliptic curve), and ESIGN (a digital signature algorithm).
More details at  .../epoc, .../psec,

What doesn't? :)
Gale seems to have a better security story, but Jabber certainly has the
momentum and large force behind it.
Plus, it's XML so you *know* it's good.

@_subject: CFP: PKI research workshop 
The ABA Information Security Committee has a mailing list where some
great discussion of this is taking place.  It's a closed mailing list;
ABA members only, but the archives are public.
I recommend looking at some of the articles there; this one is a great
starting point:
     "The idea was to replace the signature.  Let's say that a signature
 has two properties:  identification and constancy.  The first means
 who you are and the second means that you are the same legal person
 each time communicating. PK gives you the second, but not the first...."
I'm biased; Chuck and I used to work at the same company, although we didn't
work together enough.

Seems pretty nice; thanks for doing this.
Any chance of using SHA1 instead of MD5?  MD5 seems to have weaknesses;
the IETF says not to use it in their protocols, for example.

All that work...  when a conventional PKI will solve all the problems
you listed.

Unh, no.  The same way the ASF determines who gets commit access could
be teh same way the ASF determines who their CA will give
release-signing keys to. The same way the ASF takes away someone's
commit access is the same way they could update the CRL.
All those key update, distribution, revocation, etc., stuff -- all those
hard problems you said you want to automate -- go away.  Recipients need
only trust the Apache CA and its CRL.

Who controls commit access?  What mechanisms protect that?  The same
mechanisms that protect *the source* can be the same mechanisms that
protect *the release.*
I don't know anything about how the ASF works, but there is clearly some
working mechanism that lets you folks control access to your servers and
write access to your source tree.  From a security architecture
perspective, those some mechanisms should be able to control certificate
The only point of signing software is so that someone can be sure it
hasn't been tampered with.  Why build a complex mechanism, when a CA and
its CRL -- protected just like, and just as well as, the master source
tree -- will do the same thing, but simpler?
Nonense.  If this note doesn't explain things well enough for you to
appreciate the difference, then I'll take the blame for poor expository
I've probably reached the limits of interest to the cryptoraphy mailing
list, and I have no wish to further intrude on members at apache.org
(especially since I'm not one :), so I'll try to end my participation

Nobody is gonna indemnify the world against infringement, but I thought
Stanford's SRP protocol comes as close as realistically possible to what
you're asking for.

For what it's worth, *I* don't know enough about it to have an opinion.
I'd be curious what others think.

Perhaps safer:  after you sign the publication, sign a statement of
identity (I am Inego Montoya, and I cracked Ebook as shonw in the paper
signed by the key that signed this), write it to a floppy, and store
that somewhere, then destroy the key.

The referenced I-D seems to have expired and not been replaced by
anything I can find.
Does anyone have a "spki certs in xml syntax" doc?

@_subject: SPKI (WAS Re: Field slide attacks and how to avoid them.) 
Thanks for the links, folks.
I believe HP's espeak uses (used?) SPKI as its authorization certs, but
since they're chairing the Oasis SAML group that might change (but hence
my spki.xsd query).  I also think Intel's open source CDSA has some
support for SPKI (been a long time since I looked at the source), so
presumably they might be doing some stuff.  One possible contender
there, the Intel medical information protection project/company,
recently shut down, however.
It'd sure be nice if Win2.5K replaced SIDs with SPKI :)
