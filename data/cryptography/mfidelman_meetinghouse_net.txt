Actually, in my experience, NSA has two very different groups of people working on crypto - one group tries to break it, the other builds it.  The ones who build it try to make it very secure - since most of their stuff goes to the military.  And then you have folks like the Naval Research Lab who brought us TOR, and folks in the State Dept. who are sponsoring crypto work for dissident groups (the ones we like, of course) - who also try to build pretty secure stuff.
Now how much the NIST folks - who set standards for commercial crypto - build in back doors, is less clear.

In the government stuff, it's the crypto algorithms that are classified, and typically embedded in silicon.  Holes in code are one thing, but looking for backdoors on chips is a lot harder; and looking for backdoors in the math is even harder.

@_subject: [Cryptography] The role of the IETF in security of the 
the net?
Well, if we change the words a little, the government world has always made the distinction between:
- certification (tested), and,
- accreditation (formally approved)
And there are lots of cases of accredited system that are not certified, or at least only loosely certified.  (The Designated Approving Authority signed the paperwork.)
Those kind of map onto trustworthy (tested, certified) vs. "trusted" (we have to use this one, the General says so).
And last time I looked, a lot of the folks who focus on security in the IETF context, play in that world.

@_subject: [Cryptography] copyright office DMCA exemptions rulemaking - 
Hi Folks,
The United States Copyright Office is conducting the sixth triennial
rulemaking proceeding under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(?DMCA?) concerning possible exemptions to the DMCA's prohibition
against circumvention of technological measures that control access to
copyrighted works.  (
One of the proposed exemptions is relevant to those of us interested in
software security matters - which, I assume, includes many on this list.
Proposed Class 25: Software?Security Research, to "allow researchers to
circumvent access controls in relation to computer programs, databases,
and devices for purposes of good-faith testing, identifying, disclosing,
and fixing of malfunctions, security flaws, or vulnerabilities."
I seem to find myself leading an effort to draft a statement from the
ACM, supporting the exemption - along the lines of:
- security and integrity of computer software is critical in a broad
variety of areas - voting, SCADA systems, medical systems, etc., etc.
- testing and validating such software is critical and - as professional computer scientists and engineers, we can't perform
such testing and validation under threat of Federal Felony prosecution
under the DMCA for violating copyright as part of reverse engineering,
penetration testing, and otherwise (attempting to) circumvent protection
(obviously, we'll be expanding on that language)
Going beyond motherhood statements, it would be VERY helpful to have
some specific examples to cite of research that was not done, for fear
of prosecution under DMCA.  And it occurs to me that folks here
might be able to provide such examples.
So... if you have either:
a. published some research that didn't go as far as you'd like, for fear
of DMCA violation, and/or
b. not performed some research that you consider compelling, for fear of
prosecution (or conducted, but not published :-)
Can you send some details my way.  Ultimately, what would be most
helpful would be personal statements that we can attach to the submission.
Note that time is short - submissions are due on 2/6, and we'll need at
least a few days for review, comment, and voting on the final official
submission ACM makes.
Thanks very much,
Miles Fidelman

Are you talking Gmail, MS, Yahoo, etc. webmail, or hosting your own (e.g., Squirrel).  If the later - Squirrel seems to have a crypto plug-in, I assume others do as well.

One nit - the article references "proofs" of Fermat's conjecture as trisections.  I guess Wiles proved otherwise.

If we're including negotiation in the process, then we're talking about the more general case of the Byzantine Generals Problem -  (also unsolvable)

Several folks have pointed out that, functionally, you're trying to solve the "Two Generals Problem."  I've pointed out that it looks like you're trying to solve the more general case - generally referred to as the "Byzantine Generals Problem" or "Byzantine Agreement."
Both problems have been studied, in great details, over the years - and the math seems to show that there a general case solution is mathematically impossible.  (I don't claim to follow all of the math, but lots of people have worked through it.)  There are practical, limited solutions - also widely studied (particularly for applications like recovery from split-brain situations in fault-tolerant systems).  The more general solution seems to require a trusted third party.
I think what people are telling you is that you can argue the merits of your approach all you want - but the math has already been worked, and if you want to understand the limits of what you're proposing, you should go study the math, rather than engage in torturous verbal Miles Fidelman

It occurs to me that there's something funny about the original problem statement.  I'm wracking my brains for a use case.  In the real world
This is not how things work.
Contract formation tends to fall into several categories, each of which has sequencing and timing considerations:
- Formal offer/accept sequencing (e.g., when buying a house). Generally, this involves sequential actions/committments:

@_subject: [Cryptography] God Mode backdoors 
Well, easier said then done when trying to protect yourself about national scale entities.  There's a pretty nice list of hardware level exploits, with references, at If - say the NSA, or the Chinese Government, wants to - they demonstrably have the ability to insert things at manufacturing time, or replace chips during shipment.
Now, if by "non-consumer markets where security actually matters," you're talking military - and that's where the entire system is typically specified by the government (can you say "clipper chip?").  Whether there are back doors in the hardware, or the algorithm, has been long subject to debate - facts are a little harder to come by, since this stuff is all classified TS/SCI.
