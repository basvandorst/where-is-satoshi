@_subject: Garfinkel analysis on Skype withdrawn? 
Hi,
I found Garfinkel's paper here:
Gary Smith
I am Italian, so forgive any possible error or whatever regards the English
language. I read your article on mail-archive.com
( at metzdowd.com/msg03305.html)
and I am so interested in reading what Simson Garfinkel has written about
Unfortunately the link you posted in the message is now broken
If you have this article saved on your hard disk could you please send it to
Best regards
Vito Catozzo
