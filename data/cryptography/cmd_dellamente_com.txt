There is a large difference between upgrading from WEP to WPA and
upgrading WPA code. In the first case, the operational characteristics
of the network will change. This falls under the "non-trivial task"
definition. In the second case, you've already done the hard work of
conversion, and are simply applying patches. There are several systems
on the market that can automate this kind of work.
