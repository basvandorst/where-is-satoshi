@_subject: [Cryptography] GeekCrypt: A Secure Fork of TrueCrypt 
?I ?
?wonder, why everybody assume ?
?that this statement is from the actual developer of TrueCrypt?
I guess, that the "bad guys" who wanted to kill the project, would be very
happy to kill its fork too. So should"nt we be a little bit more suspicious
to statements that refer to the "dev" of TrueCrypt??
