@_subject: what's wrong with HMAC? 
But then again, Paul van Oorschot and myself found a key recovery attack
on envelope MAC that presents a certificational weakness of envelope MAC
as described in RFC 1828 (our Eurocrypt'96 paper).  Once a collision is
found, one has both forgeries and key recovery, which is not the case for HMAC.
I must say that I don't understand this claim:
...but of course I would like to see your preliminary paper (even after 10
What we know now is that keying MDx-type compression functions through the IV/H_i
input is more secure than through the message input; this has no immediate
implication on the discussion of HMAC/envelope MAC however.  I still maintain
that I would prefer to key the compression function in both inputs (a la MDx-MAC)
- maybe the common sense approach that is better than HMAC and envelope MAC.
Finally, I want to strongly defend theoretical analysis to improve the
understanding of a scheme; but it is important to understand the model and
assumptions of the reduction proof, the implications and limitations of the
analysis and not to overclaim.

@_subject: [Cryptography] nuclear arming codes 
I remember a talk y Gus Simmons in which he described that, when he read
the new directions paper by Diffie and Hellman (introducing public key), it immediately struck him that this would be a perfect solution for user authentication for nuclear applications.  In any case he did not hint at knowing about public key cryptology before.
On the other hand, when he invented MAC algorithms (probably for the same purpose),
his patent application was hit with a secrecy order. Moreover NSA refused to give him any MAC or encryption algorithms to deploy on Sovjet territory - that's how he came up in the mid 1980s with information theoretically secure Conclusion: it may well be that NSA had invented public key cryptology earlier, but they would not tell the Department of Energy about it.

One minor advantage of random number generators is that interoperability
requirements are not so stringent - unless you want to interoperate
with the cryptanalysis tools of three-letter agencies  :-)
So switching defaults may be easier.
By the way: while we have failed badly at (secure) algoritm
agility, this does not imply imho that it is impossible to make
(secure) algorithm agility work.

To provide a slightly broader perspective:
Bert den Boer, Antoon Bosselaers:
Collisions for the Compression Function of MD5. EUROCRYPT 1993: 293-304
(these collisions also give free start collisions for MD5, but with the same message and two different IVs).
Dobbertin's work finds collisions for a single IV that is different from the IV of the MD5 specs (semi-free start collision)
Free-start and semi-freestart collision attacks have
been defined in

Why bother with patching public keys, making them amenable to
factorization, if you can patch executable code instead?
If you can target executable code (and I see why not, it's all the
same to KSM), it is very clear that there cannot be a software-only
defense.  (The authors try to frame this as a software problem which
needs fixes in GnuPG etc.)
Rowhammer can indeed target executable code, but corrupting a public key is more attractive for an attacker:
- Rowhammer can only flip a bit in a certain memory region but not in a specific memory location. Flipping any bit of a public key will lead
to compromise, which is not the case for code. - Finding out which bits are useful to flip in executable code typically requires manual work through reverse engineering (and this work has to be repeated for every binary).
While protecting public keys with error detection codes is only a partial
solution, it is an easy thing to do that raises the barrier. On the other hand, protecting the complete code brings a large overhead.

@_subject: [Cryptography] AES related issue 
The best related key attack on AES-256 requires four related keys
with a very specific relation and requires 2^{99.5} chosen texts
with a specific structure. The time complexity of the attack is 2^{99.5}. For details: Very nice cryptanalysis work, but it is not very likely that anyone will see any biases in a casual experiment as described above (just to be
sure: this is an understatement). I would categorize "horrible related-key weakness" as pure fear-mongering.
Let's focus on real problems.
