FWIW I am not :)
both vcm and chacha20-poly1305 are not nonce resistant and standard AES-GCM (with 92 bits nonce) can be safely be used “only” for 2^32 times :)

@_subject: [Cryptography] How to try to predict the output of Micali-Schnorr 
hi *,
I have put some thought on How to try to predict the output of Micali-Schnorr Generator (MS-DRBG) knowing the factorization in [0]
This led my to consider Solinas prime. Is anyone interested on giving a look into it?

hi Dominik
one of the author of the paper here.
This is indeed correct. One of the things we tried is invalid curve attack

@_subject: [Cryptography] Linerar Feeback shift register in Solinas paper 
The Solina's paper Generalized Mersenne Numbers [0] contains a Linear Feedback shift register I am not able to understand.
You can find the lfsr i am talking about at page 4 of the paper [0] or simply in this question I made in  the crypto stackexchange site.
It is supposed to be a normal Linear Feedback shift register but it doesn't seem to follow the "normal" lfsr rule. Is anyone able to explain the logic it follows? Thanks in advance
