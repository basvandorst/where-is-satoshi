In the linux world, there is something called OverlayFS, which is an overaly file system.  Some organizations use that to build a basic boot image, and then provide an overlay.  So if an update to an overlay is corrupted, a reversion can take place by replacing or turning off the overlay.
There is also something known as CRIU is used to checkpoint/update/restore the kernel, also known in the lInux world.
These two tools don't necessarily provide all your feature requests, but they may help you get closer to your destination.

Proofs of concept outlined at indicate 1) reading kernel memory at 2000 Bytes / second, and 2) gaining access to other processes from within a KVM guest.

7 - 30 days would be painful.? Yes some systems do have automation. But there are other systems with complicated relationships:? a dns server over there, a web server over here, and automation/manual system somewhere else, ...
And systems protected by certificates aren't just web servers sitting on the same server as the dns server for the TXT based authorization.? There are email servers involved with certificates. No web front end.

Yes, all this is not impossible.? I, too, manage my own DNS servers.? Allocating the time to tie everything has been on my 'round-tuit' list for a very long time.
As it happens, my DNS servers are automated via SaltStack.? So that is the easy side of things.? It is now a matter of rebuilding my Dovecot server, automating it and its cert; rebuilding my old SendMail server into maybe Exim, and automating its cert; the web servers need to get their SaltStack client installed, and hooked into the provisioning process, ....
The real hard part is some older HP servers with their ILO.? Not quite certain how to automate their private key and cert request.? I hope the newer Dell with iDRAC have a better solution for getting their certs upgraded.? Can those be automated?
All of these services are scattered through various multi-hop ssh security zones, thus, designing the access patterns, and cert movements, will be an interesting challenge to choreograph.? A few command line scripts, some cut'n'paste, some service restarts, and things are ok for now every few months.
Some IaaS vendors I know might need to make a push on their own automation to manage their even larger set of certs -- on new as well as older gear.
Yep, business opportunity for sure.? I think many organizations could use a good dose of automation.? And probably a good dose of additional pki.? And maybe some revamping.? I've seen some long lived self-signed certs floating around on vpn tunnel setups. Issues?? Maybe. Probably.
For the less sophisticated little guy, 90 days is probably not much of an issue for manual processes.? If the process had to be invoked more frequently, I think the point of optimization for cost-per-unit-effort vs effectiveness may shift in a non-optimal direction.
But I have no idea as to how many little guys with independent systems there are 'out there' vs how many have fully automated solutions with their cloud providers, or even how effective those are.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but my ACME api can't automate the auto-renewal for my email server if it doesn't have a web port open, or my HP ILO servers for the management port, or the VPN servers with other styles of lockdowns, .... other forms of automation are thus required, at various levels of complexity.
