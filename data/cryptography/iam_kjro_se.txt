He didn't say it isn't MITM-able. He said that it cannot do so
invisibly. In his model Eve would be able to perform a MITM attack, but
it would be immediately apparent to any party since the public
information would have to change.

It makes sense, except for the fact that encrypting files with a RSA
Public key is far slower than encrypting them with a 256-bit AES key.
Since CryptoLocker's goal is to hit as many files as possible so it
catches something important, it makes sense for it to use the 256-bit
AES for a short period of time, as long as the AES key is deleted.
Almost sounds like it would be worth having some sort of software keep
their eyes open for CryptoLocker and grab the AES key, if possible,

What is so crazy about this analogy?
Public Key encryption works as follows:
Your son-in-law build a little lock factory he gives you that you put on
your computer, this machine creates padlocks that only his key can open.
So when you want to send him an package, you just tell the machine to
print a padlock, you put your package into a box, lock it with the
padlock and mail it to him. As long as you know the lock factory you
have is his, no one but him will be able to open it.
What am I missing here?

The missing piece here is you can copy such a signature with a good forger.
Public key makes it so copying a signature requires something more.
I think signature is a misnomer in this circumstance.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Why is  emailing me my password? 
I think that's absurd to say that it gives a false sense of security. It
only gives a sense of security if you didn't read the text when you
entered the password in the first place. It keeps people from doing mass
unsubscribes trivially.
If someone was targeting you, yes, they would be able to delete your
subscription, but that would likely be true with little effort to begin
with if you are of the type that doesn't read that your password is
stored insecurely and sent in plain text when you enter it.

I think a surprising number of people could be talked into $10/mo.
If the donations could be done effectively anonymously, it could
probably get far more.

@_subject: [Cryptography] RSA equivalent key length/strength 
I would argue that 1024 DHE is worse than no PFS, for the same reason
that using DES is a bad move. It is likely to be inherently insecure and
provides a higher sense of security than is valid for the situation. By
insisting that 1024 to be ok, you are, in theory, permitting people to
feel comfortable with an insecure system.
I have always approached that no encryption is better than bad
encryption, otherwise the end user will feel more secure than they
should and is more likely to share information or data they should not
be on that line.
By insisting on 2048 (or higher), you force the issue and ensure that
the overall network is more secure.

This is the most important element, and legislation that states you
"cannot" share that information won't be enough, especially since the
NSLs have guaranteed that it can be circumvented without any real effort.
If Google, or other similar businesses want to convince people to store
data in the cloud, they need to set up methods where the data is
encrypted or secured before it is even provided to them using keys which
are not related or signed by a central authority key. This way, even if
Google's entire system was proven to be insecure and riddled with leaks,
the data would still be secure. You cannot share data that you can never
have access to.
Albeit, from a political perspective this could be Kryptonite since less
savory types will be inclined to use your services if you can show
effectively that the data stored on your services is inaccessible even
under warrant. It will be hard to handle the public relations the first
time anyone of the standard list of "think of the children!" group of
criminals starts to use your services.

My question and, if I can find time, desire to do research in, is how small
is the search space given the symbols you are sent. Is there a way I can
listen in and figure out the pattern from someone's card given enough data
probably after a few dozen you should be pretty close to guessing what the
pattern is for any given card.

@_subject: [Cryptography] What is going on with TrueCrypt? 
Since the author of Truecrypt wants to remain anonymous, and any lawsuit
about copyright infringement would reveal who he was publicly, I would
assume that the license is more of a courtesy thing than anything else. I
don't think it's enforceable anonymously.
