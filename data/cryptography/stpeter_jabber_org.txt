It seems Google is assuming that SASL PLAIN is acceptable once you've completed STARTTLS on port 5222 (or if you've connected via SSL on the old-style port 5223). Decide for yourself if that's "secure" and whether the iChat warning is justified.

You may trust CAcert's root more or less than a root that is trusted by Microsoft. Personally, I find CAcert to be an interesting experiment in webs of trust.

Well, in the Jabber/XMPP world you can run your own server (just as you can in the email world). I see no harm in e2m channel encryption in that (or any other) case if you've got a client-server architecture. Granted, e2e security is also desirable.

RFC 3923.
But no clients support that yet to my knowledge.

We don't expose IP addresses in XMPP, instead we use logical addresses managed by servers. That's a different approach from what you've described, but of course you're free to build an alternative presence and messaging protocol and network if you'd like. :-)
OTR encrypts only the message text, but XMPP can be used to send all sorts of interesting XML traffic (such as SOAP, XML-RPC, etc.) in addition to simple IM. So we want to encrypt more than what in XMPP is the XML character data of the  child of the top-level message stanza. RFC 3923 enables XMPP implementations to encrypt the entire XML stanza, but no one has implemented that yet and it doesn't support perfect forward security etc. Another possible approach being discussed is here:

No one advised any such thing, and e2e was a requirement addressed within the IETF by the XMPP WG, resulting in RFC 3923.

Yep, the same old story. :-)
No, we have 200k registered users on the jabber.org server and some
servers have even more. You can run your own server, though, and accept
connections only from other servers you trust, etc.

Based on my experience with CAcert, that statement strikes me as a bit
optimistic. And yes, I am a CAcert assurer (currently ranked  and I
follow all the mailing list discussions etc. But AFAICS, prime time is a
ways off for CAcert.
Have you looked at StartCom?

We could just as well say that "encryption of remote server sessions is
rare in everyday use". It's just that only geeks even do remote server
sessions, so they use SSH instead of telnet.
The thing is that email is in wide use (unlike remote server sessions).
Personally I doubt that anything other than a small percentage of email
will ever be signed, let alone encrypted (heck, most people on this list
don't even sign their mail).

The short answer to your unstated question is: anonymity is not high in
my scale of values. The long answer will require some reflection on my
part, which I won't post here but at my blog when I have the time.

Monolithic consumer IM services (AIM, MSN, Yahoo, etc. are like that.
Existing federated IM standards (e.g., Jabber/XMPP) are not.
Well, in the Jabber/XMPP world we require authentication, servers must
stamp the from addresses, and we use (at a minimum) reverse DNS lookups
to verify server identities (or use certs with TLS + SASL-EXTERNAL if
you want true server-to-server authentication). So I'd say the abuse and
identity problems are not as bad in IM (at least the IM technology I'm
familiar with) as in email. But you'd hope that we've learned a thing or
two since email was invented. ;-)

I never made the strong claim that the federated Jabber network is or
always will remain spam free, only the weaker claim that its abuse and
identity problems are and will remain less serious than those of the
federated email network as it exists today. There is no magic bullet,
and a spam-free utopia is not an option if federated communications are
desired. I do not dispute that if Jabber becomes popular enough, there
will be rogue servers that don't enforce local authentication (although
with server dialback and TLS they can't fake from addresses at other
domains, see RFC 3920), and that those who deploy Jabber services will
need to blacklist those domains. I do not dispute that there will be
spam bots and that server admins or end users will need to block
communication with those bots (e.g., using the privacy list protocol
defined in RFC 3921). I do not dispute that there will be phishing
attacks (e.g., using internationalized addresses that look like but are
not identical to familiar addresses) and that client software will need
to take appropriate measures to differentiate between legitimate and
mimicked addresses (e.g., using petname systems as described in
JEP-0165). All I'm saying is that we have a lot of the infrastructure in
place (and are building more) to make abuse harder and identity stronger
than it is on the existing email network. Is Jabber perfect? No. We're
just trying to make it good enough that the bad guys will go elsewhere
(which, so far, they have).

IMHO trust is something you do, not something your browser does. Unless
you're going to delegate trust to the browser manufacturers...
In CAcert, assurance is an action. You show me two government-issued
photo IDs (GIPIDs) and I compare them with your visage and physical
person; if I think they match, I "assure" you for some number of points
in the web of trust. If you get to a certain number of points, you can
use the Class 3 root. If you get even more points, you can become an
assurer (someone who does assurances). I happened to use the "trusted
third party" process for assurance (get copies of my GIPIDs witnessed
and notarized by two persons who are legally authorized in my
jurisdiction to witness and notarize documents), which results in more
points initially and the ability to become an assurer more quickly.

Video killed the radio star? I'm an IM partisan, but even I have given up on trying to kill off email.
I prefer the phrase "second-millennium". :-)
Interestingly, the public communication systems that are "secure" (Hushmail, Skype, etc.) are all centralized. I can't claim that a decentralized approach like Jabber is secure, though we're working on it...
Can't agree more. (Not that agreement is the sine qua non of discussion.)
So how do we abstract from or extend what (somewhat) works in the real world to something that might work in the online world?
