Judging by the log (captured using Trillian), google talk is using TLS, thus the Legacy SSL support isn't there, but plain text authentication is ok

I am aware of Jabbers support for GPG/PGP, but did I miss their support
for user certificates? I have seen no indication of such support, what
client supports it?

Yeah, and they use simple character replacement for storing the admin password on their DSL modems, specifically the 675 and 678 models, they use telnet to admin the things and finally.... Their idea of how to protect these modems from the CodeRED worm is to change the port the web interface is listening on.
Cisco seems to be doing these kinds of boneheaded things for quite sometime.

If I may inject my humble opinion(that isn't necessarily a response to
this peticular email), I may not be as informed as some but....
While I admit that PKI is flawed, I don't see anyway that PSK could used
How are PSKs going to be shared in a secure way?
are we talking about generating a new key for every connection?
    if so how do you validate the key?
    if not, how do you validate that the key hasn't been compromised by
someone who put up a phishing site?
In my opinion, PSK has the same problems as all symmetric encryption,
its great if you can share the secret securely, but distribution to the
masses makes it infeasible.
certificate, like the USPS electronic postmark site
 allows and should enforce, then the security
issues wouldn't be issues, as there would be nothing usable handed off
to an attacker. Furthermore the site could be sure of the users
identity, something none of the other solutions I have seen address.

Show me one sight that uses PSKs to secure its connection to the masses. ATMs would be infeasible if they were not a 2 factor authentication
system, and every day we see more cracks in the way that system is
implemented.  Starting with the way the PSKs are shared. Your "solution" doesn't cover any of the problems with phishing, come
on, if all we have is a preshared key, how is a user who can't even
verify the details of a cert going to know if the site they have
connected to is legitimate, all those wonderful AOL users will be easily
duped into putting in their 1 weak password of "love", "sex", "god" or
"money" and the phisher will have their info.   And we won't even get
into the fact that easy to guess PSKs are the one real weakness symmetric encryption systems that actually can keep the secret of their
PSK. I also wont start on a rant about how all those wonderful AOL users
won't be able to keep track of all those PSKs if  they are unique to the
With PSK you cannot verify
-not domain ownership
-the key belongs to the domain you are connecting to
-the key hasn't been shared with an evil party that is now impersonating
your favorite website
in fact without the details in the cert there is nothing to verify. Without Public/Private key encryption there is no mitigation of a man in
the middle attack, verification of either party, for sites like Amazon
or Hotmail, PSK introduces many many more problems than it will ever
solve. The only exception might be is if the 2 parties have a unique PSK such
as an banks ATM system, and there are systems that handle just that kind
of massive symmetric key storage (RSA makes a nice one) but is that
safer than Public/Private key encryption? No, if it were, PGP/GPG and
X.509 wouldn't exist.
The Achilles heel of symmetric encryption is always the same, sharing
that key securely, and a secret that is shared is not a secret.

Thus ATMs and the weak 2 factor authentication system they use are
untrustworthy, I knew that already, but as I said, its better than not
having the multifactor authentication.  The fact that many cards may be
used as credit card and you thus bypass the second factor, is a HUMAN
failing, the entity accepting the cards are supposed to check the
signature, against a photo id, ESPECIALLY if the card says "See ID".
But this overabundance of text doesn't solve my problems with the
assertion that PSKs are somehow more secure than Public/Private key
encryption with a trusted third party as verifier, and specifically the
X.509 Certificate Authority System that is the backbone for SSL.
No one is touching on the key issues
 sharing of keys securely and how to validate that they haven't been
 how a user is supposed to keep track of the secure keys (kind of a side
 how the validation of identity of these systems would work
Peter brought up ATMs and I wasn't going to go out on a limb and say
they aren't trustworthy before, but the truth is, they aren't
trustworthy.  That being said, its a completely beside the point.
Unless the issues I pointed out are addressed , PSK is a much WORSE
solution than trusting a third party for verification of the other
entities identity.  Especially since you profess that certs are
"redundant and superfluous standin for the real information", how I am
to verify that a given website in Timbucktoo, is owned and operated be
the entity making the claim without going there myself, with SSL we have
SOME assurance that someone verified it. Its no different than trusting that the people at the DMV did their jobs
when a drivers license was issued, but even drivers licenses aren't
acceptable authoritative proof that someone is who they profess to be. Here in Nebraska we have one of the most difficult drivers licenses to
forge, so what did the criminals do? they stole the machines, so they
could make perfect forgeries.   Trust must lie somewhere, if you have a
structure that gives some assurance of that the entities are who they
say they are, that is a world better than lacking those arrurances. So, my point is very simple, how am I to verify that a website, that I
have no control over, that has the proper PSK is who they say they are? I have seen no answers, and I still see the same flaw, with ATMs
websites or anything else, a shared key isn't a secret, and if you are
professing it is, how are you to know it hasn't been comprimised?
