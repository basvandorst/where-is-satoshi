Call for Papers           First IEEE International Security In Storage Workshop
             December 11th, 2002 -- Greenbelt, Maryland, USA
                                              Sponsored by the
    IEEE Computer Society Task Force on Information Assurance and the                  IEEE Security In Storage Working Group The ability to create large shared storage systems in a secure manner is an
area that has received little formal research or results. A comprehensive,
systems approach to storage security is required if storage consolidation is
to succeed. This workshop serves as an open forum to discuss storage threats,
technologies, methodologies and deployment.
The workshop seeks submissions from academia and industry presenting novel
research on all theoretical and practical aspects of designing, building and
managing secure storage systems; possible topics include, but are not limited
to the following:
  - Cryptographic Algorithms for Storage   - Cryptanalysis of Existing and Proposed Systems and Protocols
  - Key Management for Storage Novel Implementations
  - Attacks on Storage Area   - Networks and Storage Systems   - Insider Attack Countermeasures
  - Standardization Approaches   - Deployment of Secure Storage Mechanisms   - Defining and Defending Trust Boundaries in Storage   - Security in Federated Systems
  - Relating Storage Security to System and Network Security   - Security for Internet Storage Service Providers
The goal of the workshop is to disseminate new research, and to bring together
researchers and practitioners from both governmental and civilian areas.
Accepted papers will be published by IEEE Press in a proceedings volume.

abstract, a list of key words, and an introduction. The introduction should
summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a
non-specialist reader. Papers may be submitted in ASCII text, PostScript, PDF,
HTML, or Microsoft Word.

figures, and appendices (using 10pt body text and twocolumn layout). Authors
are responsible for obtaining appropriate clearances. Authors of accepted
papers will be asked to sign IEEEcopyright release forms. Final submissions
must be in camera-ready PostScript or PDF. Authors of accepted papers must
guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference.
Papers that duplicate work that any of the authors have or will publish
elsewhere are acceptable for presentation at the workshop. However, only
original papers will be considered for publication in the proceedings. Important Dates

@_subject: "Wild and Crazy": Interview with Palladium's Mario Juarez 
I think his comment is can you cannot backup the key.
Maybe the answer is that the key is in the processor and you must 1. get a new identity whenever you change processor chips and 2. that moving disks from machine to machine is not possible, only
plaintext copy.
Seems workable to me :^(

@_subject: Call for Algorithm for Disk Sector Level Encryption Standard 
Call for Algorithm for Disk Sector Level Encryption Standard
(For more information go to  IEEE-SSSC Storage System Standards Committee (
Security In Storage Working Group (
The Security in Storage working group is looking for algorithms and
modes for addressing Encrypted Storage. The initial focus is the ability
to encrypt disk devices at the sector level (not at the file level). The
goal of creating a standard for to allow multiple compatible vendor
independent implementations.
This requirements provides five significant constraints,
1) Confidentiality the obvious requirement. AES is expected to provide
this capability.
2) The disk is read and written in sectors (or multiples of sectors).
Sectors are normally 512 bytes. There is no room for any expansion or
any additional integrity information.
3) The sectors are written and read at random. That is, each sector (or
group of sectors) are stand alone and may be updated independently. This
implies that chaining between sectors is not possible and that the
sector number can be a factor of an implicit Initialization Vector.
4) Non-malleability of the data is a requirement. That is, the
ciphertext can not be manipulated in any way to provide any
understandable plaintext changes anywhere in the sector, possibly even
in the face of a decryption oracle. It is desirable that any ciphertext
manipulations "randomize" the entire sector (or group of sectors).
5) Dictionary attacks must be minimized. Since information on disks for
the management of the file system is regular (partition map, boot
sector, i-nodes, free space, etc.) the ability to guess plaintext is
possible. It is expected that items 1-4 will provide a dictionary attack
only at the individual sector level. That is, a dictionary attack can be
applied to sector 123, but this dictionary is of no valuable at any
other location on the disk.
The "Loop Driver" by Ted Tso, Werner Almsberger and Jari Ruusu meets
items 1-3. One can update this driver to use double AES in PCBC (chain
left, chain right) to be able to meet 1-5 requirements. (See Menezes
Handbook of Applied Cryptography for a definition of single PCBC mode.)
Even with this it is an open issue as to the security of double PCBC
mode. It is an open issue if there are other modes that can accomplish
this with less overhead than double encryption.
Since storage is a very performance and latency sensitive media, there
is a desire that the algorithm to be parallelizable and pipelinable so
that hardware implementations minimize the performance impact of this
The first meeting of the SISWG will occur June 20, 2002, 9am to 4pm at
the Hotel Thayer, 674 Thayer Rd., West Point, NY (845) 446-4731.
The agenda will include a description of the requirements, relevant
attacks and presentations from attendees proposing algorithms and modes.
There is a meeting fee of $90 which will include lunch and refreshments.
Advanced registration is preferred.
 If you wish to have time on
the agenda, please contact Jim Hughes jim at network.com. For more information contact Jim Hughes jim at network.com.

@_subject: FC: Hollywood wants to plug "analog hole," regulate A-D conve 
I will add one more gallon of fuel to this fire and then sit by and
watch it burn... Imagine *if* there is a mandated change that there be some kind of
digital content filter in all D-A and *if* there is *any* probability at
all (no matter how small) that non-copyrighted material will trigger
this, would you put your life into the hands of a machine that will kill
you if all of the redundant D-A converters fail at exactly the same time
because of this "feature"?! Who should your children sue, Sony? Who pays
for all the design, development and testing to prove that this event
will not occur? Will this cause these machines to be developed in India
I honestly feel for the entertainment businesses and their losses, but
trying to keep honest people honest, while crippling US competitiveness,
seems to be a waste of their silver bullets, IMHO
