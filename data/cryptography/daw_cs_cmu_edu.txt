@_subject: crypto question 
I attended a talk on this result and the impression I came away with was
similar to yours. They argued that they can construct some of these
unobfuscatable functions that also belong to the class of encryption
functions (and I think the class of "block ciphers" would work just as
well in this argument), and that therefore anyone who claims to have a
general scheme for obfuscating encryption functions is selling snake
oil. They actually used Cloakware as an example of such impossible
claims. However, this result would still seem to leave hope that any
particular encryption function, not so artificially constructed, might
still be obfuscatable. I go to school with a couple of these guys, so I
can feel them out a bit on what they think the practical implications of
the proof are.

@_subject: but _is_ the pentium securely virtualizable? (Re: Cryptogram: 
I spoke with someone who had evaluated the appropriateness of the VMWare
internals for security sandboxing with respect to just this point. He
seemed to believe that it is simply not possible for processes in the
guest to escape the sandbox (perhaps, in light of the paper you
cite, this signals inefficiencies in VMWare). Other people on this list
were, I believe, involved in porting VMWare to be hosted under the BSD
architecture and may be able to speak further about this. In any case,
the broader point that has been made repeatedly is that even if the
Pentium is not efficiently, securely virtualizable due to quirks in its
instruction set, clearly there are architectures which are but which avoid
the objectionable, user-hostile, aspects of the Pd scheme.
