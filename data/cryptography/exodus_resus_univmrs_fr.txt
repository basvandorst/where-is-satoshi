@_subject: ANDOS-based secure voting system 
This is my first post on this mailing-list since i'm new with cryptographic problems. I also apologize in advance for any language mistake I'll I am currently interrested in programming a secured voting system using ANDOS (All-or-Nothing Disclosure of Secrets) protocol.
I've found many documents describing this kind of voting protocol like this :
1) "Ivan" publishes the list of  eligible candidats
2) Each voter informs "Ivan" his intention to vote
3) "Ivan" publishes the list of all voters
4) Each voter receives an unique identifier using ANDOS protocol
5) bla bla bla...
the identifier will be used for every transferts between "Ivan" and the corresponding voter.
I know ANDOS is a quite hard and complex algorythm, but it's not a problem for now.
My question is : how can we prevent a single person from voting multiple In other words, although an ANDOS-generated number can be used by only one single person, i can't see anything preventing a single person from using multiple ANDOS-generated identifiers, if this person asks "Ivan" several times - hiding his real identity - for a identifier.
Of course, a solution would be to separate the attribution of identifiers and the vote itself, assuming identifier attribution is a physical process where "Ivan" gives identifiers and marks on a list the future voters as having got their identifier. This process must be physical in order to really identify the voter (for instance with his identity card). First, a corrupted "Ivan" could mark on his list anyone. Then, even if we try to secure it, man may be quite disappointed to use a physical process for e-vote.
Thank you in advance for answers!
