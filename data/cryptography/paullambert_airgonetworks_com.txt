@_subject: don't like the price? change the barcode! 
The membership cards at many stores use barcodes (
 ).
While most have a magnetic stripe, they are often entered using
a bar code scanner (especially when the mag stripe accidentally gets
Many home labeling machines are able to print bar codes.  White home made bar code labels placed on the card are difficult to distinguish from the original card.
For example, the 'Safeway Club Card' that I'm currently using
is '41002004587'.  Anyone with a label machine can now identify
themselves at Safeway using this number.  This identification
will effectively prevent the fines imposed by Safeway for
those that refuse to identify themselves.

It has an excellent graphical simulation of several versions of Enigma
and is claimed to actually interoperate with real machines.
It only runs on 'RISC OS', so you need to run a virtual Acorn (RISC OS)
Machine:  to run
the very graphical Enigma simulation ....
