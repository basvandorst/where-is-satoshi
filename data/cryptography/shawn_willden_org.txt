From what I read, the design is quite careful to avoid that issue -- in fact avoiding it is one of the primary design goals.
From the user's perspective, what James was describing will work just like any normal application -- the user starts the app, selects "Open File", sees a file chooser dialog, picks the file he/she wants to work on and clicks "Okay".
Underneath, what happens is that when the application is started, it sees a file system that contains nothing but the app and its supporting libraries.  When the user clicks "Open File", the app requests the service of the OS, which takes care of displaying the file chooser and getting the user's selection.  After the user has chosen the file, the OS then maps the file into the app's file system and returns the pathname so the app can open and manipulate it.
This is true.  The OLPC may have an advantage here because its constrained environment (128MB RAM, 512MB persistent storage) will force applications to be simpler, just so they fit.
It might be nice to isolate the tabs, but I think the limitations imposed by Bitfrost on the browser as a whole are sufficient to prevent a large class of Sorry for continuing this non-crypto discussion, but I think it's a very interesting one.
