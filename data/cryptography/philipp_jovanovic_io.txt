@_subject: [Cryptography] Collisions w/SHA-1 ~$100,000 TODAY 
The input to the inner layer of a hash function based on the Merkle-Damgard construction (which is used by SHA1) are
- a message block and
- a chaining value.
For the first block there is no previous chaining value though and thus a fixed initialisation vector (IV) is used.
In a freestart collision an attacker can choose the IV.
That’s it.
All the best,

@_subject: [Cryptography] Collisions w/SHA-1 ~$100,000 TODAY 
To provide some perspective:
- 1996: Dobbertin publishes the first free-start collisions on MD5 [1] - 2004: Wang et. all present the first true collision on MD5 [2]
Note that in the case of MD5, nobody knew how to construct collisions back in the day. For SHA1, however, we already know how to do it, see Marc Stevens PhD thesis [3], with an estimated complexity between 2^{60.3} and 2^{65.3} operations (see also [4]). As usual with such things, it is hard to reliably predict how much the recently published SHA1 free-start collision helps to construct an actual SHA1 collision. I would expect though that it won’t take another 8 years as in the case of MD5.
All the best,

@_subject: [Cryptography] Berlin Cryptotraining (March 19 & 20) 
Hi everyone,
Jean-Philippe Aumasson and I are organizing another cryptotraining (as already given before at e.g., Google, BlackHat Europe, and Troopers) in Berlin on March 19 & 20, see:
- - We cover crypto basics as well as more advanced topics such as post-quantum cryptography, secure messaging, and cryptocurrencies/blockchains.
Early bird registration is still open until February 19. You get an additional 10%-discount using the registration code turing10. Group / student discounts upon request.
For further questions feel free to ping us via cryptotraining at protonmail.com.
See you in Berlin!
Jean-Philippe and Philipp
P.S. Thanks a lot to the metzdowd admins for letting us advertise this event here.
