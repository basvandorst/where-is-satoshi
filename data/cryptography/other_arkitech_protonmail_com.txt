I have updated iso-images and added more information and screenshots.
from the feedback of previous post.
This is a new multi crypto currency platform I've developed from scratch for the past ~3 years, it is run on raspberry pi.
I am looking for more testers and/or expert opinion. Happy to answer questions.
Please have a look at: Thank you.

Unfortunately the answer is going to be (temporarily) deceptive.
The operating system image contains a pre-configured raspbian system where user gov has sudo powers, hence you have root privileges.
For maintenance purposes I have (temporarily) root access too via
ssh port 16671.
I'll remove maintenance access as soon as automation is improved and I don't need it anymore to upgrade or recover the system.
in /usr/local, the binaries us-wallet and us-gov, (gov and wallet daemons) with their libs lisusgov.so and libuswallet.so are (temporarily) precompiled without source code. The rest of parts are conf files and bash scripts.
you can always strace the programs to check their interactions with the kernel and assess they are not doing nasty things.
The upstream repositories in /etc/apt/sources.list are the raspbian official ones so no other binary in the system would be supposed to be untrusted.
In order to have full peace of mind you could run the node in vlan (or in a wireless guest net).
As soon as I have enough cycles of usage feedback and complete the anonymization of the git repository, I'd start the dev community by releasing the sources for review/improve.

I post all answers to raised questions so far.
I'd like to receive more feedback about my new crypto platform, it is helpful to me,
as they help me to write english rather than C++ , : )
Thanks for the help
All invited to evaluate it.

============================== START ==============================
Dear crypto enthusiasts,
I've been working in a new anonymous cryto-platform for the last (almost 3) years.
I'd like to share it with this mailing list, the one used to bring bitcoin to the world 11 years ago.
Anyone would be interested in testing a new 'bitcoin' I wrote from scratch?
The features are:
*language is C++. Efficient, nodes are currently run using raspberry PI.
*Consensus is BFT-with signed messages. Adaptative cycle period (currently fixed to 1 minute)
*2 daemons: gov (public system) and wallet with P2P trading capabilities (private system)
*Accounts can store arbitrary data and multiple coins.
*console RPC clients for gov and daemon
*Multi coin, any participant can create their own coin, defining supply.
*collaborative (rather than competitive). Nodes receive Gas every minute
*atomic multicoin transactions with inputs and outputs
*EC is secp256k1
*No mining. All participants receive pay every consensus cycle.
*The legitimate blockchain is agreed by consensus on each cycle by determining the legitimate last block hash (instead of defining it like bitcoin does, i.e. the chain that accumulates the biggest PoW)
*SDK for building apps in various languages . currently C++, Java and C#
*Android app
I'd be glad to respond to questions or to invite to run a node in my current alpha network (I've been running it with ~50 nodes for more than 1 year) and is working fine.
here is the url of one of the nodes:
I haven't produced much documentation, but I'd be willing to try to answer any question or give more information.
Thank you.

Hi everyone,
Just touching base with the cypherpunk lists.
Indeed I am quite frustrated with the list, but who cares, I think this project deserves interest (like many other out there this is true), but at least I'd like to say I am alive and still evolving the project.
Last time I surfaced I was anpha-11, now I am compiling alpha-22; it's a long way to the top if you wanna rock'n roll.
I've post this in reddit, calling for alpha testers.
If you know about crypto and have explorer soul and you're so kind, please help me constructively to make this tech mainstream. It could pay off.
On other matters, how are you doing?, anyway, Thanks for your feedback, no matter negative or positive.
Best wishes and regards,
Other Arkitech

How can it be verified that a signature has been produced by a private key that is stored in a password? Is there any trustable service that provides such a world-wide service?
If it happens to exist it would centralize the system.
This method is equivalent to having a group of trusted people that select which public keys are eligible to mine, the different Govs who generate the passports.
It is a bright idea though, mindstorming to improve POW, : )

I have renewed the landing page including more information about the USPS cryptoplatform I've designed.
If you find it more convenient I have attached a pdf document with its content.
You are always welcome. Enjoy.

I wonder why not using the same secp256k1 used by Bitcoin. It is bullet proof as it is publicly able to keep safe billions in capitalization.
I wonder why this is not the cypher suite of choice today.
