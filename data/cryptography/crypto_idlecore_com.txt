I'm a programmer, I need a way to have several people sign the same
message, and then send that message to several other people. I'd like to
be able to scale 'several people' to up to a million, so a list of
individual signatures doesn't work so well. I'm not sure what
cryptographic tool I require, but I'm looking into aggregate signatures.
Something like this:
I couldn't find however a single implementation, I couldn't find one in
openssl, nss, or anywhere else. Does anyone know of a decent
implementation? Does anyone know if there is even a standard?

My interest in aggregate signatures is related with my interest in
cryptocurrencies as well. For the application I have in mind I don't
need the verification, nor the signing, to be fast, but it needs to be
faster than performing the same operation for each individual signature,
hopefully it will have constant time when people are signing the same
message. I think I'll benchmark the relic-toolkit soon and find out.
Thank you for all this information.

I'm going to think about contracts in the future. Right now I'm working
on a fee distribution protocol that, instead of mining, depends on the
agreement of all potential fee receivers. Maybe a million peers was a
bit much, but since the cryptocurrency in question removes incentives
for pool mining, as well as proof of work, I anticipate even cellphone
users will be able to 'mine' currency, so I'm aiming high. I've been
having several problems with this protocol, one of which is bandwidth
usage, hence my interest in aggregate signatures.

It's not my biggest problem right now, the fee agreement takes much more
bandwidth as it stands, but yes, there will be use for aggregate
signatures there as well.

I meant to say I removed incentive for pool mining, and replaced proof
of work. The need to prove something is still there it just won't be
work, it will be stake.
I'll need both multisignatures and aggregate signatures. I think I
managed to overcome the extra overhead with aggregate signatures for
many messages by using pools of signers, but I'm still working on
creating and managing such pools safely and efficiently.

When there is a relatively big post, and there are a couple of pieces of
the message we wish to comment on, should we quote the first piece,
comment bellow, then bellow the first comment quote the next piece, and
comment bellow, or is it better to quote all text, and then comment both
pieces bellow?
