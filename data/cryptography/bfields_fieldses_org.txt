An example of a "right of a copyright owner under this title" is the right
to distribute copies of a work.  A copy-protection scheme limits the
exercise of this right.  The "copyright owner" referred to here is the
person who the particular right belongs to, not necessarily the person
whose exercise of that right is being limited.

Also, the impact of such a proof is often that it represents a milestone
in understanding a certain piece of theory, so in the long run the ideas
used in the proof may be useful even if the result is no suprise, just
as in the cas of factoring challenges, when the work done to come up
with algorithms that can factor large integers may be important, and the
fact that someone was able to factor an integer of a certain size may
say something about the state of the art, even though nobody will
actually give a hoot what the factors turned out to be.
Of course, who knows about this particular case--apparently this guy has
a history of premature announcements.

If all that information's printed on the outside of the card, then isn't
this battle kind of lost the moment you hand the card to them?

Oh, right, sorry, I missed that.
Well, obviously there's some gap between what you need to make use of
the card convenient, and what you'd need if you were an attacker willing
to spend some minimum of effort.
Tiny cameras are pretty cheap these days, aren't they?  The employee
would be taking more of a risk at that point though, I guess.
