@_subject: [Cryptography] Characteristics of "robust, good cryptography" 
Knowing that “robust” and “good” are somewhat vague, can a cryptographic algorithm, RNG, implementation, key creation/exchange methodology and hardware platform be robust and good if unknown persons who the sender did not intend to have access to the plaintext can gain that access to it through baked-in weaknesses, key sharing or related cryptographic schemes, without any interaction with the sender and intended receiver(s)?

@_subject: [Cryptography] What if Responsible Encryption Back-Doors Were 
I suppose “Responsible Encryption” requires a clear definition. Combining that term with “Back-Doors” complicates things.
If managing the security of and access to Private Keys is included in “Responsible Encryption”, then the involuntary and/or coerced transfer of those Private Keys into the hands of unintended, uninvited, unknown and unaccountable parties will require substantial twisting of the word “Responsible”.
“Encryption” is just one piece of the process and machinery in which a user generally intends to limit access to certain data or metadata to the recipient he or she intends, and to no other. It is that end-to-end intention as a whole that must be enabled and protected. The challenges to that will continue in the form of boiling-frog exercises of rolling government mandates/threats/carrots/sticks to network, service, software and hardware companies.
