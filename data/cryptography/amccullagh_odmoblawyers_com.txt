Can anyone point me to any papers dealing with the issue of whether Shamir’s Secret Sharing scheme is quantum crypto resistant.  In particular if it is resistant does the resistance improve if the complexity of the scheme increases.  That is, with n out of t, is 2 out of 3 keys less resistant that say 11 out of 21?
