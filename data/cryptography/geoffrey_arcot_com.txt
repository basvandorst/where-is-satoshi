No, remember that if the IV is in the clear, an attacker can
make some controlled bit changes in the first plaintext block.
(There has been no assumption of integrity enforcement.)
I wonder how Adam Perez is communicating the IV.

============================== START ==============================
To expand on what Duchovni said, you might want to look into
the concept of cross-certificates (which are heavily used with
bridges).  The surprising thing, at first, is that you can issue
any certificate after it was originally issued.  I can issue
the leaf cert you got from Verisign last year.  Tomorrow, I
could create my own SS Root CA, and issue a cert for the
Verisign Intermediate CA, by putting myself as the Issuer,
the Verisign Intermediate CA as the Subject, and putting the
Verisign ICA public key in it.  Your leaf cert will now chain
happily up to either the Verisign SS Root, or my new SS Root.
So this is not just a thing that works for renewing self-signed
I shouldn't speak for Gutmann, but I assumed that he meant
that the server should send the new root *before* the old root
expires, so that the client can prepare in advance for the expiry.
As an aside, there are some funny issues around having a
signature done before the signer cert expired, but deciding
*after* the cert has expired, whether to trust it.  It was
ok yesterday, but maybe it's not ok today -- what has changed...?

@_subject: question re practical use of secret sharing 
Do you mean the "k of n" operator cards?  For those, I don't
think nCipher is using real secret sharing.  I would guess
that the HSM knows the secret(s), and counts the operator
cards that are submitted.
There is a financial standard for distributing ZCMK's (Zone
Control Master Keys) that splits the ZCMK up into three
pieces the same length as the original.  This is "3 of 3".
nCipher and other HSM vendors support this, and it's used
wtih a little hand-held PIN pad.  I guess this would count
as an example of products that use secret sharing.  Perhaps
this is what you were referring to.
