Hi Dan,
I really don't follow this argument.
If you have a 'strong' system of copyright control with data being
tied to users, it becomes very difficult to have privacy.  If you have a strong privacy system (I'm using privacy in the anonymity sense),
then it becomes hard to prevent me from sending you Metallica songs
I agree its time to be careful what you ask for, but I don't see how
to build strong copyright controls in a society with privacy.

Not in the sense that it is weak (you can put quite a bit of load on a wall of those) but in the sense that it is different than your typical dried-mud sort of brick.  Designing protocols is a hard field, and
there seem to be lots of mistakes made when people use RC4.  Is that
because its a bad cipher?  No, its because people aren't used to

Good question; the problems with RC4 have been a mix of not knowing
how to use stream ciphers ("Don't cross the streams!") and issues with RC4 (needing to discard the first little chunk of stream as it gets up to speed.
I've seen people go to RC4 for speed more than for its stream cipher
nature.  I tend to push towards block ciphers, simply because we in
the public world have a lot more experience using them.

more seriously: I think the fundamental issue is that crypto doesn't
really solve many business problems, and it may solve fewer security
problems. See Bellovin's work on how many vulnerabilities would be
blocked by strong crypto.  The buying public can't distinguish between
well implemented and poorly implemented crypto; the snake oil faq has
helped a lot, but now you need to distinguiish between well and poorly
coded AES.  Is there a business case for doing so, or should you just

Research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can't

that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test

Clearly, people should not be restricted from doing what they want

computer security, then I think encouraging more and better
communication amongst "white hats" is a good idea.
(An interesting question is 'Is there a difference between selling
information you know you have and information you expect to have?'

Certainly, I found your long reply quite interesting, and annoyingly
thought provoking, as I was all set to start flaming you.  ;)
Here I'd like to disagree.  Unfortunately, EAL4 level stuff is
considered good enough for serious deployment today.  Witness the US
Navy's choice of OS.  Perhaps this is because people haven't learned
to tally up cost of ownerships properly.  Perhaps its because security
is not yet a requirement for commercial use.  But, as you
point out, there is no one agitating in the commercial space to fix
the issues that make EAL4 all we get.
Actually, I think it is.  I don't think that Linux would pass EAL4; as
you've pointed out, that requires a documented and followed QA
process.  Would any of the BSDs?  (I know NAILabs has done stuff on
FreeBSD, but I'm not sure where it stands.)  How does SELinux stack up
Do you think that the buyers of these higher EALs actually know what
they're getting?  My reading of the commentary on Win2k getting
certified is that most people don't know what an assurance level is,
nor do they know that there are other ones..
Do you think so?  "Certified Stronger than Windows 2000!"  That the
certification doesn't cut butter with sales to the German government
doesn't change the fact that the system is certified (by someone,
detail, detail, blah, and the commercial customer falls asleep).  So
I think that there is an incentive for someone (Sun?  IBM?) to go get
a EAL5 certification, if only to tweak MSFT's nose.
Here I strongly agree with you, however, I'm not sure that the CC are
the incentive structure; I think the problem is more fundamental,
which is that costs for insecure software are mis-allocated.  The
benefit of being able to sell a little secure software is pretty low,
and will remain low as long as someone can simply certify that there's
nothing secure that meets the requirement of running win32 code, so
lets just install windows.
As I said above, I think that the costs of running insecure software
aren't really recognized (and/or there is a belief that all software
is roughly equally insecure and thus expensive.)
I look forward to hearing it.

Actually, I think the RSA patent did make a difference:  It caused PGP
to 1) hit a wall of possibly justified FUD that delayed deployment and
2) change its public-key cipher suite in a non-interoperable way.
As such, the patent did *exactly* what patents are intended to do,
namely prevented others from using their system.  Ideally, a patent
allows the inventor to get people to pay to use their system, but in
reality, we all just invent around them, and sometimes pay for them.
But if the patented ideas are not so compelling that you can't live
without them, you can't expect to make a lot of money.

I believe that DRM systems will require not just an authorized boot sequence, but a secure remote attestation that that boot sequence was followed, and a secure attestation as to the versions of the software on your system.  So, while a secure system is needed for AT/DRM, its
not enough. To expand a little: By authorized boot sequence, I mean that I can say only software
signed by one of these keys may load.  Without that, I, or an
attacker, can load arbitrary software.
By secure remote attestation I mean that the reference monitor has a
key, which can't be exported, which can sign attestations as to what
software keys are allowed to load sw on my system.  Without this, the
copyright contoller can't decide if they can rely on your system to
act as their agent.

Hi Dan,
   Not Rome, but in Athens, Pericles said, in his funeral oration:
"The freedom which we enjoy in our democratic government extends also
to our ordinary life. We throw open our city to the world, and never
by alien acts exclude foreigners from any opportunity of learning or
observing although the eyes of an enemy may occasionally profit by our
liberality. We live exactly as we please and yet are just as ready to
encounter every legitimate danger. If with habits not of labor but of
ease, and courage not of art but of nature, we are still willing to
encounter anger, we have the double advantage of not suffering
hardships before we need to, and of facing them in the hour of need as
fearlessly as those who are never free from them. The price of courage
will surely be awarded most justly to those who best know the
difference between hardship and pleasure and yet are never tempted to
shrink from danger. And it is only democratic people who, fearless of
consequences, confer their benefits not from calculations of
expediency but in the confidence of liberality. Judging happiness to
be the fruit of freedom and freedom of valor never decline the dangers
of war."
This has been at the top of my personal web page for most of the last
3 years.

The basis for these statements is what the other systems don't do.  My
Vonage VOIP phone has exactly zero security.  It uses the SIP-TLS
port, without encryption.  It doesn't encrypt anything.  So, its easy
to be more secure than that.  So, while it may be bad cryptography, it
is still better than the alternatives.  Unfortunately.

@_subject: Simson Garfinkel analyses Skype - Open Society Institute 
The 'vastly more secure' is not my claim.  My claim is that it is
somewhat better.  Even if it's using an RC4 key of all-zeros, it is
somewhat better than what I have today, because today, my voip calls
don't even have that, and as far as I can see, I can use asterisk's
codec translator API to turn tcpdump captured streams into mp3.
(  The effort to
get skype data is slightly higher.  Until shown otherwise, I expect a
grad student could do it in a weekend.  However, that same grad
student could build me a wiretap for VOIP in an hour.  (By which
metric, Skype is nearly 50x as secure!!!!  :)
I hate arguing by analogy, but:  VOIP is a perfectly smooth system.
It's lack of security features mean there isn't even a ridge to trip
you up as you wiretap.  Skype has some ridge.  It may turn out that
it's very very low, but its there.   Even if that's just the addition
of an openssl decrypt line to a reconstruct shell script.
In that case, the value of 'better' is vanishingly small, but it will
still take an attacker at least 5 minutes to figure that out.  That
was my claim.  Similarly, I'd put VOIP above a POTs line, because I've
tapped POTS lines with aligator clips and mis-functioning cordless
phones.  We agree that its not 'interesting' or 'useful' security.

I fully agree with you that, if people had a sense of how their

But, given what people talk about on their cell phones and cordless

they think their communications are secure in the absence of any

So, that may be the case when you're dealing with an SSL accelerator,
but there are lots of other cases, say, implementing daabase security
rules, or ensuring that non-transactional lookups are logged, which
are harder to argue for, take more time and energy to implement, and
may well entail not implementing customer-visible features to get them
in on budget. Choicepoint and Lexis Nexis seemingly, had neither.  Nor are they
representational.   We lack good data, and while there are a few
hundred folks who have the experience, chops, and savvy to help their
customers make good decisions, there are tens of thousands of
companies, many of whom choose not to pay rates for that sort of
advice, and hire an MCSE, instead.  People who slap the label "best
practice" on log truncation.
I think that we need to promulgate the idea that Choicepoint is
creating a shift, that it will be ok to talk about breaches, with the
intent of getting better data over time.

Sure.  The problem with general problems is you can't solve them or
make tradeoffs around them.  You have to delve into each and say "what
can we do about this?" and "how much engineering weight should we give
this?"  In the case of Kerberos, I would venture to guess that it's
pretty low.  In which case, I think Apple might go back to Jake's
security issue with LoginWindow, and ask if the Kerberos issue is
reason enough to keep the behavior as is.
Obviously, there's a tradeoff for Apple here, and Apple has people who
have dug into the problem.  Those folks may well have good reasons to
