@_subject: [Cryptography] Lenovo laptops with preloaded adware and an evil CA 
Hash: SHA1
There's some interesting buzz online [1][2][3] about "Superfish", a
bit of adware that Lenovo has apparently been preloading on some of
its computers over the past few months.
While preloaded adware is bad enough, Superfish does something even
worse: to allow itself to MITM SSL-/TLS-protected web traffic, it
installs a CA into the Windows trusted root certificate store. This CA
is apparently pre-generated and its corresponding private key comes
with every installation of Superfish. Furthermore, uninstalling
Superfish does not remove this CA, so all users running
Lenovo's tainted Windows installation are affected, even if they took
the time to uninstall Superfish.
A user on Twitter has apparently forged a certificate for Bank of
America's online banking system [4] and I expect that we will see more
of these shenanigans to come to light over the next few days.
According to a thread on Lenovo's customer support forum [1], they are
no longer pushing this adware on customers and are asking the
authoring company to push a fix for this ASAP. Mozilla also has an
issue on their tracker to mark the offending cert as "untrusted" in
NSS. [5]
