@_subject: Computer Security Division Activities 
NIST's Computer Security Division has recently made the following information available:
1. A report of the Second Modes of Operation Workshop, which was held in the Santa Barbara area on August 24, is available at 2. A change notice for FIPS 186-2, Digital Signature Standard, is available at  This change notice specifies recommended key sizes, suggested modifications to the random number generators (RNGs) defined in the FIPS, and recommends a method for using the RNGs in the FIPS and in the change notice for general purpose 3. The Key Management Schemes document for the Key Management Workshop is available at  The Key Mgmt. Guideline for the workshop will be available in a few days. The workshop is scheduled for November 1-2 at NIST. Registration is REQUIRED because of enhanced security procedures (i.e., so that attendees can be admitted to the NIST campus).

@_subject: NIST Key Mgmt. Drafts 
[Moderator's note: Edited to remove HTML and the huge To: list. --Perry]
NIST is requesting comments on three draft key management documents, which are available at 1.      "Recommendation for Key Management, Part 1: General Guideline" provides general key management guidance for system developers and system administrators. This is a revision of a draft provided in June, 2002. Please submit comments to GuidelineComments at nist.gov by April 3, 2003.
2.      "Recommendation for Key Management, Part 2: Best Practices for Key Management Organization" provides guidance for system and application owners for use in identifying appropriate organizational key management infrastructures, establishing organizational key management policies, and specifying organizational key management practices and plans. This is an initial draft of this part of the Recommendation. Please submit comments to GuidelineComments at nist.gov by May 2, 2003.
3.      "Recommendation on Key Establishment Schemes" provides specifications of key establishment schemes based on standards developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X9: ANSI X9.42, Agreement of Symmetric Keys Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography, and ANSI X9.63, Key Agreement and Key Transport Using Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Inclusion of RSA techniques as specified in ANSI X9.44, Key Establishment Using Integer Factorization Cryptography, is planned for the future. This draft is a revision of a draft provided in October, 2001. Please submit comments to kmscomments at nist.gov by April 3, 2003.
