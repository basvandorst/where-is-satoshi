Wikipedia defines a randomness extractor as
Quite a few of the theoretical extractors proposed by researchers need
such a seed.  Which, of course, makes them unsuitable for pratical
As far as this chip is concerned, I think it is more likely that the
seed is used for a PRNG, i.e., it guarantees that the output looks
random even if the designers cannot guarantee a lower bound of the
TRNG's entropy.
It's possible that the seed is just a protection against failure of the
TRNG; this would be a feature.  (But then they should have told us that.)

You need custom drivers for this device anyway, so it might be a better
idea to let the software do a decent job.  (You might want to add to the
USB packets a header with the current settings and the actual amount of
entropy; in that case there is less danger that anybody thinks this data
is a perfectly random bit stream.)
And why are you calling it a whitener instead of a randomness extractor?
The former name could imply that the output looks random, but has less
than 100% entropy.

Quite a few sound devices have several independent inputs.
Sound devices are widely available, and cheap, and do not require
an additional driver.
If the output contains _only_ white noise, there will be the same amount
of noise at all frequencies, so the sample rate would not matter.
I believe that estimating the entropy (i.e., amount of white noise) of
a sound signal cannot be done reliably without computing the FFT.
AFAICS the patch is missing from the latest turbid version, and the
makefile references an ALSA version that is over ten years old.
However, no patch is needed; locking mixer controls has always been
possible.  Apparently, ALSA's documentation is, er, capable of

Creative builds many kinds of cards, good ones and somewhat cheap ones.
Turbid needs a sensitive input because its proof of the entropy lower
bound requires that the thermal noise of the resistor at the input
connector (assuming that such a resistor exists) can be measured.  Even
a bad sound card can have a high enough sensitivity if it amplifies its
input by a large enough factor (a bad sound card will add more noise,
but that does not matter for the proof).
24-bit cards do not need much amplification and should be good enough.
Thermal noise will go high enough for any sampling rate we can use.
Sound cards do not have single anti-aliasing filter.
A typical ADC chip has a delta-sigma modulator running at about 6 MHz,
which requires an external analog filter that reduces noise at that
frequency.  The modulator is followed by a digital decimation filter
that goes very near the Nyquist frequency of the currently used sample
rate.  (There also is a high-pass filter to remove any DC offset from
the input.)
This cut-off frequency is not independent of the sample rate.
Does it monitor anything _at all_?  As far as I can see, it blindly
stuffs samples into the hash function and trusts the calibration (and
that nobody attenuated or muted the input, accidentally or not).

Yes, if with "2X" you mean what I'd call "half".  For example, the
CS5381 datasheet says:
  Passband (-0.1 dB): from 0 Fs to 0.47 Fs
  Stopband (-95 dB): from 0.58 Fs
This filter and the HPF will attenuate extremly high and low frequencies;
what remains is usable white noise over almost the entire frequency
Why are you singling out this band?
The noise in all the other bands will cancel out these correlations.

And as it turns out, there are different decimation filters for different
sample rates (typically, higher rates have smaller passbands).
I made a quick test (using only the sign of adjacent samples), and there
are indeed lots of correlations (at any sample rate).
In any case, higher rates capture more useful noise.
(And Turbid uses the highest rate by default.)
Knock yourself out:
(The last one is an extreme case where Turbid would refuse to work.
And it doesn't have much entropy even under optimistic assumptions.)

The rngd daemon is responsible for checking the hwrng output and using
it to fill /dev/random up.  In theory, every distribution for the Pi
ought to configure it automatically.
