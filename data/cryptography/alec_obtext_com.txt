Note that this protocol does not provide forward secrecy: if a user's
private key is ever compromised, then all past (as well as future)
messages to and from that user may be revealed. This is the danger of
using static keys for DH.
You might want to look at the station-to-station protocol, which is
designed for this sort of application. It uses ephemeral DH keys signed
by static signing keys to achieve forward secrecy.
You probably also need some way of confirming that each user got the
right public key from the server.

Since we're talking about asymptotic complexity, 'small' and 'medium'
don't refer to actual sizes. Say the finite field is of order N = p^k;
we're looking at the behaviour of the algorithmic complexity as N tends
to infinity. If k is tending to infinity while p stays fixed (e.g. p = 2
or 3), it's the 'small-characteristic' case. If p is tending to infinity
while k stays fixed (e.g. k = 1 or 2) it's the 'large-characteristic'
case. If both p and k are tending to infinity, it's the
'medium-characteristic' case. The medium-characteristic case covers a
lot of different situations, and the details of the 'optimal' relation
between p and k will vary depending on the algorithm.
