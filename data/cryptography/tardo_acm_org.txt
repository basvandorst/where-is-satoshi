For signalling maybe, but not for RTP media streams and RCTP, read on down
to section 7.6.2.1 of PKT-SP-SEC-I05-020116.

@_subject: link-layer encryptors for Ethernet? 
DEC used to make one (the DESNC), I don't remember the Xerox product. Cylink used to make one, and may even still (as Safe-Net).
FWIW, IEEE has working group 802.1ae doing Ethernet MAC layer encryption. But then, they had 802.10 (only implementation I know of was the DESNC) for many years before retiring it.
The market for these kinds of devices has been notoriously small. May I ask what your use case is?
