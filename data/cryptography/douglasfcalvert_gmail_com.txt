@_subject: Locating private keys in RAM? 
I remember seeing a paper about identifying private keys in RAM. I
thought it was by Rivest but I can not locate it for the life of me.
Does anyone remember reading something like this? The basic operation
was to identify areas in RAM that had certain characteristics such as
random bits and identifiable key headers...
Any help would be greatly appreciated...
