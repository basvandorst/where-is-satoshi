@_subject: Pseudorandom Number Generator in Ansi X9.17 
The Pseudorandom Number Generator specified in Ansi X9.17 used to be one of the best PRNGs available if I am correct.  I was just wondering if this is still considered to be the case?  Is it widely used in practical situations or is there some better implementation available?  What would be the advantages/disadvantages of modifying the Ansi X9.17 PRNG to use AES instead of 3DES? Is this feasible at all?
