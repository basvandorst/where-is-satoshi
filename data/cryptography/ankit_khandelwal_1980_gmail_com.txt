@_subject: [Cryptography] Safe/Unsafe Hashing Algorithms in WinCrypt.h 
Hello Everyone,
I am trying to make a list of safe hashing algorithms present in
WinCrypt.h. This list would be used to implement whitelist or blacklist
approach in my hash verification algorithm for Windows.
Below is the current status of the list, can anyone please provide some
inputs to it? As of now, I have added MDx family and SHA1 to the unsafe
RSA signing (encryption) algorithm that uses a hashing algorithm to hash
the content before signing it.
RSA is used to encrypt the content and to sign the content hash created by
using the Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA) algorithm.
RSA is used to encrypt the content and to sign the hash created by using
the Secure Hashing Algorithm 256 (SHA256) algorithm.
RSA is used to encrypt the content and to sign the hash created by using
the Secure Hashing Algorithm 384 (SHA384) algorithm.
RSA is used to encrypt the content and to sign the hash created by using
the Secure Hashing Algorithm 512 (SHA512) algorithm.
