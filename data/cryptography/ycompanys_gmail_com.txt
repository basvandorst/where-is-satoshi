Today is the "Our People-Centered Digital Future" sponsored by Constellation
Research .
By March 2019, 50% of the world will be connected to the Internet, an
inflection point that marks an important moment for examining the
“unfinished work” of the Internet and discussing the community norms, human
rights and social contracts required in this exponential digital era.
The event recognizes both the 70th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights
the event also recognizes the 50th anniversary of the "Mother of All Demos
The event is well underway. Internet co-inventor Vint Cerf and Web inventor
Sir Tim Berners-Lee have already delivered their introductory remarks. If
you missed their talks, don't worry. You can click on the Livestream
timeline below to view them.
There are many more events to come today into the late evening. This is a
simulcast of the YouTube feed at  (which does
buffer occasionally), but with added AI captions and speaker names.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Stanford Liberationtech Needs Your Help 
Hi All,
The Program on Liberation Technologies at Stanford University (LT)
 has been going strong since circa
2006. Since then, LT has helped thousands design, use, and research
technologies that foster the public good.
Recently, the decision was made to spin off LT as an independent entity.
I'm one of the people tasked with doing so. Here are LT's major needs:
   - Recruit people to develop a new website, logo, and graphics.
   - Identify a legal jurisdiction with strong security and privacy laws
   and regulations and a server provider with a stellar reputation at
   protecting user security and privacy to host the site.
   - Determine whether to maintain LT's mailing lists on Mailman
    or to
   transition them to a content management system (e.g., Discourse.org).
   - Assess the best legal structure for LT (e.g., digital cooperative).
Any ideas? Thanks for your help and advice.
P.S. I'm sending this email on behalf LT's co-founders and not Stanford
