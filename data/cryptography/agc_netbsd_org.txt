@_subject: UCE - a simpler approach using just digital signing? 
[Sorry for ummm spamming John, my third attempt to send mail to the
whole list, caused by vanity email domains not playing well with fascist
majordomo settings - agc]
One idea I have not seen mentioned here (and which I have not yet
encountered in RL, but only weird people send me email these days) is
for the sending MTA to use pgp to encrypt mail using the recipient's
public key, available on one of the key servers near you.
Leaving out everyone's discomfort with their least favourite privacy
software, the sending MTA would then have significant work to do in
order to convince the receiving MTA to accept the mail.  Mailing list
managers would have to do non-trivial amounts of work when exploding
to various list members, admittedly; but we now have a use for all the computing horsepower that is coming down the line.
But all in all, the onus would be back on sending MTA to do
non-trivial work to convey stuff to my email address.
