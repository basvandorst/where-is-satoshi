The PasswordSafe project also produces a Java variant "PasswordSafeSWT"
that seems to run well enough on OSX.  It may be a large assumption, but
one would hopefully be able to presume that one group could produce two
viable variants, albeit in different languages.
The only red flag that is raised initially for me is that the last
release was in 2007.  That could either indicate development has died or
simply that it's a stable product with no great need for tweaking.

For what it's worth this only happens at login and doesn't reopen when
unlocking the screen.  I have conditioned myself to lock my keychain
upon login and see no ill effects; there still remains the question of
whether locking a keychain actually does anything to wipe the
credentials from memory.
As an aside, I was wrong about the discontinuation of the SWT
PasswordSafe.  It seems the passwordsafe team split it off as a separate
project, available at   That
said, their latest release doesn't work out of the box on Leopard due to
their bundling a 32-bit version of SWT.
