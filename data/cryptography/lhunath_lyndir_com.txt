@_subject: [Cryptography] "password manager" --> _authorization manager_ 
As an aside, can we really call it two-factor when both elements are knowledge factors (AFAIK, a data file is also considered such)?  Seeing as most attacks that capture the password can trivially also capture the data file.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Open Source Sandboxes to Enforce Security on 
Along with the claim of using open source code needs to come the ability to verify that the shipped product is not a modified version of said code and/or a way to replace the open source part of the proprietary system with a self-compiled and debuggable version of the open source code, both technically and legally.
Not to open a can of worms, but this is exactly the reason behind the distinction between free software and non-free open source software.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Bitcoin, litecoin, vertcoin, and derivatives 
Is there any reputable reviews of Bitcoin and its many derivatives, specifically Litecoin and the recent Vertcoin?  What are the key differences in their operation and how trustworthy are their claims (eg. vertcoin claims to be "ASIC Resistant" - can we believe them and if so, what does that really give us)?

@_subject: [Cryptography] Hashing power of attackers 
Is there any kind of recent estimation of what kind of hashing power we should expect identity thieves and other attackers to posses?  Is there public research to demonstrate what kind of cost would be associated with, say, 10B, 50B, 100B SHA-256 hashes per second?  Can we expect the cost for increasing the speed of hashing to increase linearly for all hashes?
To get started, I found a few numbers on hashcat.net:
Hash Type       PC1         PC2         PC3         PC4         PC5
MD4             15445M c/s  4245M c/s   19868M c/s  5718M c/s   183232M c/s
MD5             7893M c/s   2802M c/s   10436M c/s  3178M c/s   93800M c/s
SHA1            2495M c/s   879M c/s    3833M c/s   1103M c/s   29528M c/s
SHA256          1036M c/s   337M c/s    1413M c/s   406M c/s    12328M c/s
SHA512          179M c/s    103M c/s    383M c/s    90M c/s     1952M c/s
SHA-3(Keccak)   157M c/s    91M c/s     277M c/s    111M c/s    2005M c/s
The scrypt paper has a table with cost estimates:
Table 1. Estimated cost of hardware to crack a password in 1 year.

scrypt (64 ms)  < $1        $150        $4.8M       $43B        $52M            $6 ? 10^19
PBKDF2 (5.0 s)  < $1        $29         $920k       $8.3B       $10M            $11 ? 10^18
bcrypt (3.0 s)  < $1        $130        $4.3M       $39B        $47M            $1.5T
scrypt (3.8 s)  $900        $610k       $19B        $175T       $210B           $2.3 ? 10^23
How realistic are these numbers (and are the odd drops such as $175T -> $210B typo's?), how modern are they and is there any other reliable research in this area?  In particular, I'm interested in finding out about the different class of attackers and what kind of hashing power we might expect from them (script kiddy, criminal group with eg. a botnet, state / well funded organization).

@_subject: [Cryptography] [cryptography] Email encryption for the wider 
I'm not sure I understand what problem you've just solved.  Senders still
need to generate a keypair and encrypt their mail, receivers still need to
decrypt their mail.  All you've done is remove key lookup and replaced it
with a From: header.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Of writing down passwords 
And yet, as you point out, there is a real risk involved with writing
passwords down, especially when you do so in a non-physical location (eg.
iCloud notes, password manager).
The issue here being that in your threat model, disallowing writing down a
password is an inconvenience (forcing users to remember unmemorable
passwords) that outweighs any benefit gained from reducing the risk of
I would propose not writing them down and not remembering them at the same
time.  "Master Password" [0], for instance, generates your passwords
statelessly: instead of having an encrypted file or a diary with your
passwords, it uses a single password you can remember, scrypt-derives a key
from that, then hmac's a name for your password (eg. "adsl modem") with
that key to encode a password for the modem; eg. CuzaSasy3*Rimo.
Effectively, you have a single password you can remember, no store somebody
can steal or you can lose, and given only a computer, you can calculate any
desired password from anywhere.
The downsides are obvious: don't lose your single password and computers
can be monitored.
