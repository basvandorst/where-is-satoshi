BTW the original quote seems to be:
"Secure web servers are the equivalent of heavy armored cars. The problem is, they are being used to transfer rolls of coins and checks written in crayon by people on park benches to merchants doing business in cardboard boxes from beneath highway bridges. Further, the roads are subject to random detours, anyone with a screwdriver can control the traffic lights, and there are no police."

@_subject: security questions 
Wells Fargo is requiring their online banking customers to provide answers to security questions such as these:
What is name of the hospital in which your first child was born?
What is your mother's birthday? (MMDD)
What is the first name of your first roommate in college?
What is the name of the first street you lived on as a child?
What year did you start junior high/middle school? (YYYY)
What is your oldest sibling's nickname?
What is your dream occupation?
What is your spouse's nickname?
In what city was your father born?
What is the name of the high school you attended?
What is your best friend's first name?
What is the name of the junior high/middle school you attended?
What is the first name of your maternal grandfather (mother's father)?
What is the name of your favorite childhood superhero?
In what city did you meet your spouse?
In what city did your parents meet?
In what city did you attend high school?
What is name of the hospital in which you were born?
What is the last name of your favorite teacher?
In what city was your maternal grandmother (mother's mother) born?
What was your most memorable gift as a child?
It strikes me that the answers to many of these questions might be public information or subject to social engineering attacks...

Oh, I know we're smart enough to do that, but I doubt that your typical Facebook user will realize that their high school and best friend's first name (etc.) are public information.

Yes it does. I'm a Wells Fargo customer and I had to set my "security questions" yesterday in order to keep using their online banking system. The resulting email notification said in part:
"Thank you for taking the time to set up your security questions. If we ever need to confirm your identity, your ability to give the correct answers to these questions will help us verify it's you."

@_subject: X.509 certificate overview + status 
BTW, we give away free certificates for XMPP services here:
The root CA is StartCom, which is accepted in Mozilla, OS X, and various
other cert stores. I've noticed that these certs are becoming quite
popular on the XMPP network (plus, they result none of those cert
warnings that scare of normal users).

Realistically they all have a web-based contact form these days anyway.
Similarly, they all have live web-based chat systems that don't require
opening up more broadly. HTTP is the new TCP and all that.
For truly federated communication (BigRetailer wants its employees to
exchange messages with smaller companies in its supply chain), a more
open technology is needed, but we have those for email and IM.
However, we're off-topic for what's truly important here: not enterprise
email and IM, but secure technologies for individuals.

<521CE337.6030706
Why not share some parts with some friends and some with others? This is
related to the recently-discussed idea of a network of friends (maybe
it's because I've worked on Jabber for so long, but I like the idea of
leveraging your buddy list for many interesting features, including data
backup and mix networking).

Hi Phil, a few questions about your feature-set...
This implies that you want it to be mobile. What problems does that
solve for you?
I agree on the last two.
I still think the ideal key management device is something like what
Perry sketched out on this list several months ago: a cheap, small
device (like a Raspberry Pi) that I can place in my house and interact
with directly via wired or near-field communication (the display could
be on any other device I own). I don't see the need to take it with
me, and in fact I'd prefer that it be at home so that I know it's as
physically secure as other things I own.

By 'hosts' do you mean do you mean servers, or also endpoints? If the
latter, I see interesting possibilities for a "network of friends"
system of the kind Perry sketched out here a month or two ago.

In practice, how do we make that happen? On the XMPP network we're
pushing to make sure that all client-to-server and server-to-server
hops are encrypted (yes, I know, per-hop encryption is not enough, we
need end-to-end encryption too). Is there a handy list of PFS-friendly
ciphersuites that I can communicate to XMPP developers and admins so
they can start upgrading their software and deployments?

@_subject: [Cryptography] Why prefer symmetric crypto over public key 
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
A thousand times yes.
One doesn't need to communicate with several billion people, and we
don't need systems that scale up that high. Most folks just want to
interact (chat, share photos, voice/video conference, etc.) with their
friends and family and colleagues -- maybe 50 - 500 people. IMHO we
only need to scale up that high for secure communication. (I'm talking
about individual communication, not enterprise stuff.)
What about talking with someone new? Well, we can design separate
protocols that enable you to be introduced to someone you haven't
communicated with before (we already do that with things like FOAF,
LinkedIn, Facebook). Part of that introduction might involve learning
the new person's public key from someone you already trust (no need
for Internet-scale certificate authorities). You could use that public
key for bootstrapping the pairwise shared secrets.
Another attractive aspect of a network of friends is that it can be
used for mix networking (route messages through your friends) and for
things like less-than-completely-public media relays and data proxies
for voice, video, file transfer, etc. And such relays might just live
on those little home devices that Perry is talking about, separate
from the cloud.

Yes, that is a possibility. Personally I'm still mulling over whether
we'd want your little home device to be a Jabber server (typically
requiring a stable IP address or an FQDN), a standard Jabber client
connected to some other server (which might be a personal server at
your VPS or a small-scale server for friends and family), or something
outside of XMPP entirely that merely advertises its reachability via
some other protocol over Jabber (in its vCard or presence information).
I very much agree.
