@_subject: [Cryptography] New book and a question 
Evening all,
I am currently working on a new book about
 .
The role of the cryptography mailing list is pretty important in terms of
Bitcoin's early evolution. But I have a question I wonder if anyone can
help with .... And please forgive my ignorance in this regard ... Do you
think it's fair enough as the 'heir' or the 'descendent' of the old
Cypherpunks mailing list?
Thanks for any advice in this regard

Hi all (once again)
Does anybody by any chance have contact details for Nick Szabo?
I really keen to talk to him about Bitgold etc for the book, but all the
emails I've found online keep bouncing.
Would you be able to email me off-list if by any chance you can help put me
in touch? frizzers at gmail dot com
Thanks in anticipation - and sorry to clog up the list.
