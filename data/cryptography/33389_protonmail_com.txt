@_subject: [Cryptography] The best TRNG architecture, comming soon? 
Low entropy RNGs are interesting because many attacks assume low entropy and small state, while low entropy RNGs provide low entropy but large state (much as the effect of adding an initialization vector to a protocol).
Regardless, given that the world uses always-on devices, fast boot times shouldn?t be prioritized too much (although the timer entropy daemon, video entropy daemon, and the audio entropy daemon prove there are other faster sources of entropy) .
As long as the amount of entropy exceeds the bruteforce cost of other forms of hacking, the cost-benefit ratio will never lean towards directly breaking a cipher. Unless the state is insufficiently mixed.

Cannot understand some of these arguments.
Unless the future of embedded is accumulator CPU architectures where software is the glue logic for mostly hardware implemented functions, you?re going to be allocating memory and have a few libraries to abstract hardware interfaces. Whitening RNGs in hardware is not only unnecessary, but undesirable since biases cannot be replicable (and all devices have sensors or inputs that can be polled or read from, to add additional entropy if needed).
Backdooring a RNG by making it output random bytes by using a blockcipher where all but 32-bits of the key is known to the attacker, and where the IV is unknown would be sufficient to appear random to anyone else. No matter how many bytes one collects, it would appear random.
On the other hand, many attacks are foiled by a small amount of entropy, which is why certificates require 64-bit nonces.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Should the demarcation point for a viable 
Should the demarcation point for a viable cryptographic attack really be more efficient than brute force? It could be argued that the birthday bound is the point when a cipher should be rekeyed due to the risk of collisions or a distinguishing attack.  But then the slide attack wouldn't qualify, and further research into the slide attack wouldn't occur, nor would someone finally discover that the slide attack is vulnerable to Simon's algorithm.
Who decided upon this point? Could consensus be wrong?

To explain differently, commonly people only know what other people say, or what Google Scholar lists as popular citations. To skip ahead to the conclusion, a frame of mind can prevent encountering the truth, and not examining something that could be viable under a similar but different model can have stark consequences, particularly since quantum computing versus classical computing can have different O(n) complexities.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Better cache replacement policy for CPU caches 
Based on available information, CPUs use least-recently used as a cache replacement algorithm. This is excessively deterministic and leads to numerous side channel attacks. I propose a new cache replacement policy that would fix and prevent some categories of AES software timing attacks noticed since 2005.
All cache lines in the L1 cache will have a bitfield dedicated to each thread. When a cache line is loaded or read, a bit is set for all hardware threads except for the one requesting the data. When replacing a cache line, the first cache line with an unset bit is replaced. This is done by incrementing through each cache line and inspecting the bitfield, if the bit is set, it will be unset, and then the next cache line is inspected.
This will prioritize replacing cache lines used by the current hardware thread over cache lines used by other threads.
In the worst case, a thread will end up loading data to the L2 cache before it can load data into the L1 cache.
I call it the Canadian replacement algorithm because they are known for excessive politeness. This can be considered an inversion of the second-chance algorithm.
I won't touch upon the issue of context switches and software threads.

Shouldn?t root certificates switch to McEliece?
Certificates are used for decades, and thus is the only public key cryptography that need to be protected with the same schedule that the NSA has.
Let?s Encrypt?s roadmap for upcoming features has ?Support for signing ECDSA keys with a full ECDSA cert chain will be added later.?
Perhaps it has stalled, but it seems like people are heading into a direction where cryptography is weaker in the long term?
Maybe the transition will begin at the last minute when academics finally factor a 128-bit semiprime with a quantum computer.

=?utf-8?q?tch_to_McEliece=3F?=
A category of micro controllers possess  256 kB of flash memory, so they should be able to use code-based cryptography (even if the key size is insufficient for some future generation of quantum computers). I think the marginal increase in power consumption compared to processor size becomes absurd with embedded devices. Regardless, the transition period should probably start... somewhere?

what they asked for, with the accompanying consequences.
Actually, everyone was complaining about mandating the Clipper Chip.
The spy game is stupid. Can?t wait to see everyone justify their decisions.

Quick, everyone switch to post-quantum public keys and key exchange!
I hope everything proceeds in an orderly fashion, unlike the panics to disable Triple DES or RC4.
There are no export regulations on post-quantum authentication schemes, so everything just becomes sillier in hindsight.

It may be so that everyone was complaining about export controls, but the Clipper chip was a de facto domestic restriction.
Also, Rich Salz, please inform the CEO of Akamai that the NSA should stop ?unwittingly? mass surveil everyone.
