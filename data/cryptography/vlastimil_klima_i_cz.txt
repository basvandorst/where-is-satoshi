ANNOUNCE: PureTLS version 0.9b4
Copyright (C) 1999-2002 Claymore Systems, Inc.
PureTLS is a free Java-only implementation of the SSLv3 and TLSv1
(RFC2246) protocols. PureTLS was developed by Eric Rescorla for
Claymore Systems, Inc, but is being distributed for free because we
believe that basic network security is a public good and should be a
commodity. PureTLS is licensed under a Berkeley-style license, which
basically means that you can do anything you want with it, provided
that you give us credit.
This is a beta release of PureTLS. Although it has undergone a fair
amount of testing and is believed to operate correctly, it no doubt contains significant bugs, which this release is intended to shake out. Please
send any bug reports to the author at .
0.9b4 is a bugfix release which includes protection against timing
attacks on RSA (Boneh-Brumley/Kocher) and CBC padding (Vaudenay).
Server users and clients who do client authentication should upgrade.
Client-only users may not need to.
