I'm one of the authors of the attack. Actually if you look closer,
you'll see that they do it wrong in many ways.
Here is a video that we just release this morning at EKOPARTY:
Slide, paper, and tools will be released on

We promised Microsoft not to release anything before they have a
working patch. Now they have it, so we release the slide we presented
at EKOPARTY. Check it out.

I guess they just follow SSL.
BTW, they screw up more badly in other places. Download .NET
Reflector, decompile .NET source, and do a grep 'DecryptString',
you'll see at least three places where they don't even use a MAC at

Have you checked out Tink? We provide misuse-proof APIs like your proposal.
Quoting our security and usability design goals [1]:
Tink assumes that the attacker has complete freedom in calling methods of a
high level interface; under this assumption the security is not
compromised. For example, if the underlying encryption mode requires nonces
and is insecure if nonces are reused then the interface does not allow to
pass nonces. Tink also assumes that the attacker can get access to memory
passed into a method, even if a crypto operation (e.g. decryption) failed.
[1] I found that Tink's interfaces are useful for a large number of use cases.
You're probably not the target audience for this API.
I found that it's good for all software developers, regardless of their
My employer has 20-30K developers. Only 10-20 persons are allowed to roll
own crypto including my team. The rest use our interfaces. I cannot remember
the last time someone complained that they cannot use the interfaces because
they needed to choose their own nonces.
A competent security program should never require developers to know
about nonces, let alone designing crypto protocols. These jobs are best
left to
the professionals.
A better solution (not applicable here, but same class of problem) is
