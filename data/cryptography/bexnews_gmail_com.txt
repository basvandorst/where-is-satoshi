@_subject: [Cryptography] DAG vs Blockchain 
Much hype exists around DAG (directed acyclic graph) in some parts, as an
improvement on blockchain crypto because, for one thing, it does away with
mining. However isn't mining the thing that incentivizes increased
computing power to verify the blockchain and protect against a 51% attack?
Would DAGs be less secure against attackers with lots of computing power
*because* there is no mining?
