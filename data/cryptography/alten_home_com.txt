@_subject: I'm looking for FSE2001 proceedings 
Does anyone know where I could purchase or get the papers submitted
to the Fast Software Encryption Workshop 2001?  Springer-Verlag
does not have it available for purchase yet.  I looked at the Web site (url below) and emailed the 2 Japanese fellows apparently
running it but they have yet to respond.  Any pointers or help
would be most appreciated.  I'm cc'ing cyperpunks and cryptography
mailing lists as well.
