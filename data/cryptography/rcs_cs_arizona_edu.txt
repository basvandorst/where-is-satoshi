@_subject: moving Crypto? 
It's time to consider moving the annual Crypto conference out of
Santa Barbara.  The obvious places are Vancouver, Toronto, or
Mexico.  I know zilch about these places as conference venues.
Could someone knowledgable summarize the relative merits?

Peter Trei, show some respect.
Brian Gladman implemented all 15 AES candidate ciphers.
He knows the field.

@_subject: prime proofs 
Dave Wagner writes
People were doing this fourty years before Pratt's paper.
See, for example, Dick Lehmer's 1933 paper "Hunting Big Game
in the Theory of Numbers", where he describes proving primality
for a 19 digit divisor of 2^95+1.  It's on my web page at
Or see Math. Comp. in the early 1970s for examples with more
depth in the recursions.

Matt Blaze:
    It is probably no longer acceptable, as it was just a few years ago,
    to throw together an ad-hoc authentication or key agreement protocol
    based on informal "obvious" security properties, without a strong
    proof of security and a clear statement of the model under which the
    security holds.
    For some recent relevant papers, see the ACM-CCS '02 paper my colleagues
    and I wrote on our JFK protocol (
    and Ran Canetti and Hugo Krawczyk's several recent papers on the design
    and analysis of various IPSEC key exchange protocols (especially their
    CRYPTO'02 paper).
Eric Rescorla:
    And I'm trying to understand why. This answer sounds a lot like NIH.
    Look, there's nothing wrong with trying to invent new protocols,
    especially as a learning experience. What I'm trying to figure
    out is why you would put them in a piece of software rather     than using one that has undergone substantial analysis unless
    your new protocol has some actual advantages. Does it?
I imagine the Plumbers & Electricians Union must have used similar
arguments to enclose the business to themselves, and keep out unlicensed
newcomers.  "No longer acceptable" indeed.  Too much competition boys?
Who on this list just wrote a report on the dangers of Monoculture?

@_subject: encrypted backup tapes 
Back when software was free, ~1974, the standard DEC PDP10 disk->tape backup
program, FRS, included an encryption option.
