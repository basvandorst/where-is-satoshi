It's a question of trust.
The trust of the content owner in this case.
If the content owner is to trust the h/w (which has been called a varient of a media player elsewhere on this list) then it will require a signature from a trusted third party.
As has been noted before in the smart card case, trusted third parties need to know that the private key, for which they issue a cert, is well protected.  I believe we all agree that the best place to protect a private key is h/w.
If you want a cert from a 3rd party with that level of asertion, then YOU need to prove that YOU have provide that level of protection.  Both smart cards (see FINREAD specs.) and similar h/w can provide this level of protection.  (Pls note that I did not claim that all do, only that they can do it if they chose.)

XML encryption specs approved By Jim Hu Staff Writer, CNET News.com
December 10, 2002, 10:51 AM PT
The Web's leading standards group approved on Tuesday two XML encryption specifications, a move that promises to boost the development of secure Web services. The two specs, XML Encryption Syntax and Processing and Decryption Transform for XML Signature, will enable Web pages using Extensible Markup Language to encrypt parts of a document being exchanged between Web sites, the World Wide Web Consortium said. While other methods exist for encrypting XML documents, the W3C's specifications make it possible to encrypt selected sections or elements of a document--for instance, a credit card number entered in an XML form. "This provides a way to identify parts of an XML document that may be secured by the author, so you can choose the parts that are most important and encrypt those," said W3C representative Janet Daly.

The POST is really the wrong place to put it.  Nothing reads the POST data - it is not std across anything.  And the O/S is the code that is validated for NIST.  So the o/s would need to re-run the validation in any case.   ..tom

@_subject: Verisign CRL single point of failure 
Verisign incorrectly built the new certificate causing every SSL access on IE 5.x to request a new CRL (700k) on every single SSL access.  This has been fixed, a new udated cert is available and the CRL storm is abating.  See the versign site for more details on what they did to fix the problem, but nothing of course on what they did wrong.
Note that two separte certs expired at the same time so there were two competing DOS attacks hth  ..tom
