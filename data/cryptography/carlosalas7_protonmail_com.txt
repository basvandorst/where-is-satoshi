I would like to post this question the other way around: Is reverse engineering (I would clarify: binary) needed for Cryptanalysis?

I have been reading advice on not to use PGP, some very well founded (the third one below by Filippo Valsorda deserves attention), I am including the top 3 results from google on the query: "PGP not worh it":
My question is: Is there any substitute or equivalent? And I am aware that many people advice to use Signal, however I am wondering about an e-mail specific alternative.
