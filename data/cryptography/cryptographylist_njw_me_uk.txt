IIRC this came up last year when a Middle Eastern country (I forget which) were threatening to not let RIM operate unless they could intercept blackberry messages.
However, as was pointed out then, apparently the encryption is to & from RIM's servers, not the recipient. So RIM have access to all the 'secret' messages. I expect GCHQ & the Met will make sure said systems are patched in to their surveillance programme in no time.
Unfortunately the present climate in England is such that I can't imagine such measures being anything but lauded.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Why is  emailing me my password? 
All mailman lists do this by default. It does tell you on the sign
up page that it will do so, and that you shouldn't use a 'valuable'
(e.g. used elsewhere) password - see
It is an annoying default, but so long as you don't use a password
attached to anything else you care about, I don't think it should be
too much of a worry.
