C has three really strong points:
 - portability.  It's one of the most wide-spread and portable
   compiled languages that I know of.
 - speed.  Most languages with the same level of portability as C that
   I know of are interpreted.  They will probably never get to the
   level of speed you can get with C.
 - simple or compatible ABI.  C++ could be a good candidate if handled
   properly (yeah, yeah, I know), but I've yet to see that the ABI
   used by different compilers on the same platform not differ so
   much.  Most all, I'm thinking of name mangling (uhm, not really
   sure if that an ABI issue or not :-)).
As soon as there's a more secure language that fills those criteria, I
see not reason why you'd want to stay with C.  In the mean time, we'll
probably have to keep on living with its' defficiencies (I do agree
with you about those).

unsigned char foo[8];
(no, it isn't fool proof, but close enough after 1 second of thought).

You tell me what other language combines the wide spread (which is
important for portability) and speed of C.  Maybe I should have
mentioned availability as well...

solinym> solinym> The old joke is that C combines the speed and power of
solinym> assembly language with the portability of assembly language.
Yeah, I've heard it before, and it's a lot of bull, at least the part
about portability.  I'd like to see you run an assembly program for a
68K on a VAX, or a VAX MACRO program on anything else, or...  Oh, and
for fairly modern stuff, try porting assembler between, say, an Alpha
and a Pentium...  Yeah, you probably got it by now.
solinym> Ocaml can outperform C in some cases.  Java is within an

Show me that ocaml is available on all current major platforms, and
I'll start looking at it.  And please, look outside the Unix family
sandbox.  For me, VMS is one of the must-be platforms.
solinym> I mean, technically, the python interpreter is written in C,

For some things, I'd agree.  It all depends on what we're talking
about, and from the subject, I'd gather we're mostly talking about
crypto algorithms, which is fairly low level stuff in the security
hierarchy.  I dunno about you, but it seems like most people are a bit
obsessed with speed at that level, like how many AES operations you
can do per second.  Unfortunately, the higher you go, the more complex
your operations become, and if we're talking interpreted languages,
there will always be the cost of interpretation, dispatching into the
underlying C routines, conversion of results, and so on.  I can't see
any way to get around that part.

solinym> solinym> I think C guarantees that a char is a byte, but exactly how

Nope, you're right.  For example, on old PDP-10 and DEC-20, you'd have
5 7-bit chars in each 36-bit int.  Not entirely sure how unsigned
chars were implemented, though...
solinym> Surely a smaller byte is antiquated, but a wider char is
solinym> certainly conceivable.
Yup, I realised all that, hence "it isn't fool proof".
solinym> OTOH, if C was truly as portable as is claimed, GNU autoconf
solinym> wouldn't exist.
It's true that the proliferation of incompatible header standards and
platform specific libraries have made things harder, as well as the
differing size and characteristics of some of the types.  Still,
because there's a way to build conditional code in a way that works on
all platforms, I still think it's among the more portable languages.
Not saying it's perfect, far from it, but I've yet to see another
language that has similar characteristics.
solinym> Scripts are fairly portable; I can run bash scripts in
solinym> cygwin,  I can run perl scripts using activeperl.  None have
solinym> required modification so far,
Yeah, for crypto stuff, I must say that I don't find bash or perl to
be strong candidates, at least at the lowest level.
solinym> though some use libraries ("modules") that aren't available
solinym> on the target.
Uhmm, isn't that what you'd use GNU autoconf for?  In my experience,
GNU autoconf is mostly used to figure out what the environment is
composed of, what libraries are available and things like that.
solinym> I realized halfway through this that I was thinking of
solinym> applications that use crypto, and not crypto algorithms per
solinym> se.
Oh...  when you started this thread with talking about rewriting C
libraries to something less error prone, I didn't imagine you were
talking about the higher levels of functionality.  I believe a lot of
languages have a layer to interface with the lower level C libraries,
and I know that at least Perl, Python and Ocaml have interfaces to the
crypto algorithms in OpenSSL.
solinym> But pretty much we sound like we're in agreement on most
solinym> things.
Well, at least that C sucks :-).

@_subject: [ANNOUNCE] OpenSSL 0.9.8 released 
OpenSSL version 0.9.8 released
  ==========================================
  OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
    The OpenSSL project team is pleased to announce the release of
  version 0.9.8 of our open source toolkit for SSL/TLS.  This new
  OpenSSL version is a major release and incorporates many new
  features as well as major fixes compared to 0.9.7x.  For a complete
  list of changes, please see  .
  The most significant changes are:
    o Major work on the BIGNUM library for higher efficiency and to
      make operations more streamlined and less contradictory.  This
      is the result of a major audit of the BIGNUM library.
    o Addition of BIGNUM functions for fields GF(2^m) and NIST
      curves, to support the Elliptic Crypto functions.
    o Major work on Elliptic Crypto; ECDH and ECDSA added, including
      the use through EVP, X509 and ENGINE.
    o New ASN.1 mini-compiler that's usable through the OpenSSL
      configuration file.
    o Added support for ASN.1 indefinite length constructed encoding.
    o New PKCS 'medium level' API to manipulate PKCS files.
    o Complete rework of shared library construction and linking
      programs with shared or static libraries, through a separate
      Makefile.shared.
    o Rework of the passing of parameters from one Makefile to another.
    o Changed ENGINE framework to load dynamic engine modules
      automatically from specifically given directories.
    o New structure and ASN.1 functions for CertificatePair.
    o Changed the ZLIB compression method to be stateful.
    o Changed the key-generation and primality testing "progress"
      mechanism to take a structure that contains the ticker
      function and an argument.
    o New engine module: GMP (performs private key exponentiation).
    o New engine module: VIA PadLOck ACE extension in VIA C3
      Nehemiah processors.
    o Added support for IPv6 addresses in certificate extensions.
      See RFC 1884, section 2.2.
    o Added support for certificate policy mappings, policy
      constraints and name constraints.
    o Added support for multi-valued AVAs in the OpenSSL
      configuration file.
    o Added support for multiple certificates with the same subject
      in the 'openssl ca' index file.
    o Make it possible to create self-signed certificates using
      'openssl ca -selfsign'.
    o Make it possible to generate a serial number file with
      'openssl ca -create_serial'.
    o New binary search functions with extended functionality.
    o New BUF functions.
    o New STORE structure and library to provide an interface to all
      sorts of data repositories.  Supports storage of public and
      private keys, certificates, CRLs, numbers and arbitrary blobs.
      This library is unfortunately unfinished and unused withing
      OpenSSL.
    o New control functions for the error stack.
    o Changed the PKCS library to support one-pass S/MIME
      processing.
    o Added the possibility to compile without old deprecated
      functionality with the OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED macro or the
      'no-deprecated' argument to the config and Configure scripts.
    o Constification of all ASN.1 conversion functions, and other
      affected functions.
    o Improved platform support for PowerPC.
    o New FIPS 180-2 algorithms (SHA-224, -256, -384 and -512).
    o New X509_VERIFY_PARAM structure to support parametrisation
      of X.509 path validation.
    o Major overhaul of RC4 performance on Intel P4, IA-64 and
      AMD64.
    o Changed the Configure script to have some algorithms disabled
      by default.  Those can be explicitely enabled with the new
      argument form 'enable-xxx'.
    o Change the default digest in 'openssl' commands from MD5 to
      SHA-1.
    o Added support for DTLS.
    o New BIGNUM blinding.
    o Added support for the RSA-PSS encryption scheme
    o Added support for the RSA X.931 padding.
    o Added support for BSD sockets on NetWare.
    o Added support for files larger than 2GB.
    o Added initial support for Win64.
    o Added alternate pkg-config files.
  We consider OpenSSL 0.9.8 to be the best version of OpenSSL available
  and we strongly recommend that users of older versions upgrade as
  soon as possible.  OpenSSL 0.9.8 is available for download via HTTP
  and FTP from the following master locations (you can find the various
  FTP mirrors under     o     o ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/
