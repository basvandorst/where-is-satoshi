There is new fresh FIPS-202 standardizing SHA-3.
In addition to SHA3-{224,256,384,512}, SHAKE-{256,512} were expected.
However, we got SHAKE-{128,256} instead.
So in addition to four fixed hash functions with 224 up to 512 bit
security, there are two "expandable-output" functions (XOF) with only
max. 128 vs max. 256 bit security.
So what is the point of their expansion? (In the Example docs linked in
FIPS-202 appendix E, their output values are expanded to impressive 4096
And regarding to SHAKE security.. according to the FIPS-202's Table 4,
unlike SHA3 functions, where the collision resistance is half of the
(2nd) preimage resistance, as expected, SHAKE functions have these
resistances equal (for sufficient output lengths).
Interesting.. Birthday paradox does not apply here?
Do I have a mistake somewhere? Do they?
thanks for any insider comments,

Not sure I can agree here.
SHA3-256    =~ Keccak[512](d=256)
SHA3-512    =~ Keccak[1024](d=512)
SHAKE128(d) =~ Keccak[256](d)
SHAKE256(d) =~ Keccak[512](d)
(d is output length; Keccak[c]: c is capacity)
Best SHA-3 (SHA3-512) is essentially Keccak with capacity 1024
(output fixed to 512 bits though),
best SHAKE (SHAKE256) is essentially Keccak with capacity 512.
I was just wondering why the Keccak capacity for best extendable output
hash function was not chosen to be at least as big as for the best fixed
hash function.

Thanks for brief history intro.
However, I do not think that overkill security is useless, nonsensical
and stupid. The algorithm becomes useless when the algorithm is sufficiently
