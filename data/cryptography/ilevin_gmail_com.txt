"Nonsense fence" maybe less metaphoric but more clear.

Perhaps, but sometimes rubbish just better be named rubbish without
any metaphorical allusions. For everyone's good.

@_subject: Elcomsoft trying to patent faster GPU-based password cracker 
I'm not affiliated with Elcomsoft and don't know their real
intentions, but what they are trying to do is perfectly reasonable.
Once they release a commercial product with such feature it is only a
matter of time until Microsoft or some other patent troll will run for
a patent and start suing. So, having the patent beforehand will
address this matter. It still would be beneficial even if Elcomsoft
will fail this patent application, because it will make any future
such applications disputable.

I know this is silly but I could not resist to comment on some NSA redacts:

@_subject: 5x speedup for AES using SSE5? 
This is where the following may be handy:
It is a byte-oriented AES-256 implementation without S-box tables.
Although I doubt it can be speeded up that much.

@_subject: Ransomware 
This is ridiculous. It set a totally wrong message. Converting
a plain vanilla crime into a geeky challenge for whatsoever marketing
purposes is a dead end.
A blackmailer demanding a ransom is not a technological issue but
a matter of FBI/ Interpol/ FSB/ you name it. A person behind Gpcode
must be tracked down to face criminal charges. Apart from setting
an example to future morons, it will give all the necessary keys
at once.

Certainly, it is not mutual exclusive. However factor an RSA key
hardly can help with that.
A) All the authorities ever need is always *a* person, and then they can do
the rest. In this particular case the *real* solution of the problem would be
trace the money dropper and bust the chain. The only required cryptanalysis
here is a thermo-rectal one.
B) It not about legal or illegal code, it is not about a code at all.
for ransom is a crime and demanding a ransom for digital assets does not
make this any different. A crime must be addressed as a crime in a first place.

And the main prize for a winner would be nearly ruined reputation because
nobody would trust his or her design and code ever again. Giving a client
solid proof and confirmation of their huge concern about your ability to
put some fishy stuff into their system - what else would be more assuring,
right? :)

@_subject: [Cryptography] Formal Verification 
To do a DSL for producing a formally-verified TCP/IP stack might be a bit
of overkill. For example, "a friend of mine" have done this with severely
ACSL-annotated C code and Frama-C couple years ago.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Security proofs prove non-failproof 
Not sure about the ++ thing, but there are some such tools available
to handle C. For example:
* Frama-C, * The Software Analysis Workbench, * CBMC, The last one is my personal favourite.

Yes, pointer operations, memory leaks. It also covers bounds and
division by zero checks together with signed/unsigned and float
Thanks for reminding about this one. I saw it once few years ago,
postponed looking closer until some other time and successfully forgot
about it :)
