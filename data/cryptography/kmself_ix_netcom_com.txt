I disagree with this premise.  I also see PKI being as strongly
pro-vender.  With consumers legally, and banks contractually, sheltered
from the bulk of credit card fraud risks, the burden falls on merchants.
I would expect that a merchant-based initiative to produce a
non-refutable electronic payment system would see some favor.  With
current retail numbers in the toilet, any opportunity to shave losses
should meet some favor.  A number of merchants have their own credit
payment systems, and might be the source of such an initiative.
The next battleground becomes rights to public privacy in the face of
such systems.  I'm curious as to systems which might use various forms
of one-time keys or tokens to validate transactions, there was some
discussion of this 1-2 years back, with a system proposed by AmEx IIRC,
but little followup.

Regardless, it's an assertion which may be corroborated by history of
password attacks on other systems.  Does anyone have a reference to an
analysis of dictionary and brute-force password attacks, and typical
patterns of discovery? Remaining discussion is interesting, elided.
There are exceptions for law enforcement, national defense, and
I've noted in the past, however, that data aquired through national
monitoring systems such as Carnivore or Echelon, and forwarded to
private industry, as has been alleged by the French against the US, may
not fall under this exemption, and could be actionable.

@_subject: password-cracking by journalists... 
Note that my reading the language of 1201 doesn't requre that the work
being accessed be copyrighted (and in the case of Afghanistan, there is
a real question of copyright status), circumvention itself is
sufficient, regardless of status of the specific work accessed:
    17 USC 1201(a)(1)(A):
    No person shall circumvent a technological measure that
    effectively controls access to a work protected under
    this title.
...if the measure controls access to _a_ work protected under 17 USC,
than _any_ circumvention is illegal, whether or not that circumvention
affects a protected work?
I don't see the statuatory exceptions as covering the case of the WSJ.

I'd taken some time to run 'round that logical circle myself.  I believe
the NY 2600 case dealt with this issue.  Kaplan, at least, wasn't
convinced.  I've attached Wendy Seltzer's comments to the dvd-discuss

Any chance of highlighting the revisions for those of us who'd not
memorized the earlier regs?

...and the usual mechanism is to produce various versions of the book:
  - A premium hardcover.
  - A "trade paperback".
  - A pulp paperback.
  - A premeium, leather-bound, acid-free archival quality, hand-signed,
    and specially illustrated, collectors edition.
...the price discrimination here plays on a number of factors, including
timing (HC and TC are generally released in that sequence, with 6-12
months between, pulp paperback isn't released for 12-18 months following
publication).  The different products also appeal to taste and vanity by
quality (or at least appearance) of the work.
What's distinctive about the last several years of RIAA[1] and MPAA
actions is that these industries are seekin legal sanction to enforce
price discrimination.  The basis for this legal sanction isn't
production-side differences, but an attempt to manage the demand-side
differntials which exist.
This is fundamentally different from import duties charged, say, on
account of labor, production, or environmental differences between
production methods (and costs) on industrial goods.  Here I _do_ see a
fair basis for making the distinction, if a market is to fairly value
environmental externalites.
Where I see a fundamental conflict on the two classic cypherpunk issues
of free access to data, but protection of privacy, is this:
  - Much of the fair use / DRM industry activity seeks to limit
    access to data which is inherently public.
  - Much of the privacy debate (now wrapped in the mantel of national
    security, though marketing data still plays a major role) seeks to
    make public data which is inherently private, anonymous, or both.
I see the traditional cypherpunks line in both cases as being more
closely aligned with "natural state" -- how things would be without
major intervention -- and thus more sympathetic.
If an economist can be a rock star, Varian is one of 'em.  His site, and
the book _Information Rules_ (see his website or
 are very highly recommended.  I suspect most
folks here are already familiar with them.

Or matinees.  Or generic branding.  Or outlet stores.  Or rush-delivery
premiums.  Or personal shoppers.
The point being that traditional price discrimination mechanimsms _work
by appealing to preference differentials among buyers, not by
arbitrarially, and with force of law, *imposing* such differentials_.
"Pareto-dominant" isn't a term I'm familiar with (though Google returns
some hits).  Pareto efficient or optimal is:
    the "best that could be achieved without disadvantaging at least one
    group." (Allan Schick, in Louis C. Gawthrop, l970, p.32)
    ...and I can think of any number of reasons why legally mandated
discrimination is *not* Pareto optimal ipso facto, starting with the
fact that it violates several assumptions of the free market model.  The
classic test given by Varian is:
    [S]uppose that [a given allocation] were not [optimal].  Then there
    would be some other feasible allocation that gave everyone at lesat
    as large a utility, and someone strictly greater utility.  But the
    welfare function is an increasing function of each agent's utiluty.
    Thus the new allocation would hav eto have higher welfare, which
    contradicts the assumption that we originally had a welfare maximum.
    Hal R. Varian, _Intermediate Microeconomics_, WH Norton & company,
    1987. pp 534-535.
Since CSS, ipso facto, prevents certain allocations, it is not Pareto
