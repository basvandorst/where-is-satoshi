do you have any reference for that?  i am trying to find support using
google's search with date constraints, but am not finding anything.
the nsa paid $25m for certicom's patents according to
 - maybe that is what you remember?
all the reports on the $10m deal emphasise that it is new information; if it
was reportd at the time then that is quite significant.

@_subject: [Cryptography] deniable symmetric ciphers? 
you may be looking for "distinguishing attack".  so, for example
 shows that there is
some relevant resource for AES.
see also ideally, ciphers should not have such attacks, but they seem to be fairly
common (perhaps because they are often easier than anything else - you only
need to find some statistical irregularity, not exploit it; also they are
often innocuous and require large amounts of data).
you may be asking "is there any common symmetric cipher with no known
distinguishing attack?" - but i don't know the answer to that.
there are other problems implicit in your question, as others have said.

@_subject: [Cryptography] how reliably do audits spot backdoors? 
Go is better -  - for unsigned
values (recent code from Google / Adam Langley seems to use Go).
Julia is similar -
- but also specifies signed behaviour (Julia is IMHO becoming a pretty nice
language - in many ways it is high-level and "dynamic", but when the rubber
meets the road you can get fixed (known memory size) types and fast
performance.  I have been using it while learning a little about block ciphers
and it's worked nicely.

@_subject: [Cryptography] [cryptography] NIST Randomness Beacon 
the idea of a service that provides data unknown before a certain date (like a
photo of a recent newspaper) was suggested here -
for fun, i implemented that here -  (the random
value is updated every 50000 secs, roughly, and encoded as a "memorable
of course, in this case, a PRNG was used, and i am not NIST (so i am not
guaranteeing unpredictability ot autonomy to the same extent!), and the output
is only ~50 bits in size.
as far as i know, no-one uses it for anything...

@_subject: [Cryptography] GnuTLS -- time to look at the diff. 
Not sure why this wasn't included in the above (so perhaps I have it wrong),
but the diff is
(linked from  after "apply
the patch for").
It's a combination of (multiple times)
   if (result < 0)
     {
       gnutls_assert ();
-      goto cleanup;
+      goto fail;
     }
   if (result < 0)
     {
       gnutls_assert ();
+      result = 0;
       goto cleanup;
     }
