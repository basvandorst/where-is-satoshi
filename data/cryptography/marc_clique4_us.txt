Wow.  So, pretend for a minute that I have a threat model that doesn't trust asymmetric cryptography, period.  Is it possible to design a PFS protocol for this model?  I'm all in favor of forward secrecy, but I also have great respect for human capacity to solve extremely challenging puzzles.

Most here would be familiar with the AES key schedule, which expands 128-, 192-, and 256-bit keys into key schedules totalling 1408, 1664, and 1792 bits.
Would AES be any weaker had it been designated, for instance, as AES-1408, AES-1664, and AES-1792, with keys of this size being directly generated and used, and no subkey expansion at all?  And if not weaker, would the resulting cipher continue to strengthen as expected every time another round and 128 key bits is tacked on? (AES-65536, AES-1048576, etc.?)
In these questions, I do not mean to allege that AES-128 is insecure.  Nor do I allege that these aren't old and well-settled questions.  But I do want to double-check my suspicions.
Thank you!

Jerry, thank you!  I like it, although I see a notable distinction between this and the more traditional mechanisms for forward secrecy. This one doesn't appear to permit offline backups of master keys.
It might be that the only workaround is brute force; e.g., instead of having backups of a key, have backup /keys/.  And this could be doable.   But I'd love to hear any other approaches.
