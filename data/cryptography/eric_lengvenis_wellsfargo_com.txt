@_subject: Has there been a change in US banking regulations recently? 
I'm usually pretty up-to-date on these regulations and I'm not aware of any recent changes. As for Wachovia's changes, you'll notice that it now says "A Wells Fargo Company" in smaller print beneath the Wachovia logo. That's the reason for their switch; our name on their (our?) site. Unfortunately, it appears that not all is working right. If you go to  it redirects to  just fine, but if you type in  it does not redirect you and your browser will throw a domain name mismatch error because the certificate is for  (Confirmed on IE8, Firefox 3.5, and Chrome 5). The browser treat these as near apocalyptic errors with huge warnings. Firefox especially. I've notified the appropriate people. Eric Lengvenis

I agree. I think it is just the 100th monkey effect.

I'd like to clarify a bit. PCI-DSS wasn't developed by the big banks. It isn't usually enforced by big banks except insofar as they are liable for PCI-DSS compliance when outsourcing to or partnering with other companies. So they may be forcing it on the SMBs you've worked with because they're liable in some way.
PCI-DSS was the brainchild of Visa. I'm a member of X9F (X9F6 is the payment card security standards committee) and we wrote an open letter back in 2005 to Visa and Mastercard asking them not to set new, separate standards for the financial sector but to work from within X9F. They ignored us. Even though you clearly indicate that they aren't truly voluntary via your use of quotes, when the PCI group (VISA et al.) can unilaterally level huge fines and/or penalties for non-compliance they really are compulsory.
Luckily, PCI-DSS compliance != security. Or is that unluckily because of how much money is wasted complying that could be better spent securing.

Moore's law helped immensely here. In the last 5 years systems have gotten about 8 times faster, reducing the processing cost of crypto a lot. I'm familiar with one site that has 24 servers evenly divided across three geographical areas. To entirely SSL-enable their site required only one new server at each site. Meanwhile, load-balancing SSL terminator/accelerators have improved even faster due to improvements in load-balancing, network compression, etc. So putting one of them in front of a previously na?ve load-balancing scheme, like basic round-robin would provide enough offloading to SSL-enable an entire site.
The big drawback is that those who want to follow NIST's recommendations to migrate to 2048-bit keys will be returning to the 2005-era overhead. Dan Kaminsky provided some benchmarks in a different thread on this list [1] that showed 2048-bit keys performing at 1/9th of 1024-bit. My own internal benchmarks have been closer to 1/7th to 1/8th. Either way, that's back in line with the above stated 90-95% overhead. Meaning, in Dan's words "2048 ain't happening." There are some possibilities, my co-workers and I have discussed. For purely internal systems TLS-PSK (RFC 4279) provides symmetric encryption through pre-shared keys which provides us with whitelisting as well as removing asymmetric crypto. Or, possibly stepping up the key-size in accordance with Moore's law, which would take several years to reach 2048-bit, but each time a certificate expired the new certificate could be issued with the next higher keylength.
Besides, I think we all know that NIST's 2010 algorithm transaction isn't going to happen on schedule. At the IEEE key management summit back in May (IIRC) Elaine Barker from NIST presented a back-off talk in which NIST only "strongly recommends" 110-bit security by 2011, and pushes the real deadline out to the end of 2013. That was subsequently released as a draft SP800-131; available for comments [2]
Of course, the industry had five years to plan for this, and no major vendors seem to be ready. Most comments are essentially vendors sighing with relief.

This is a fairly well known problem for which many vendors have solutions of varying quality. I'll summarize a few approaches.
In general you want to have the window between the time a pre-boot authentication (PBA) bypass is set and the time of the reboot that consumes the bypass be as small as possible. Alternatively (my preferred) you want to have a pre-boot environment that can make a secure check to see if it is still on a safe/secured network and if it is, bypass PBA. This way PBA is bypassed any time the system is in a safe facility.
1) Some type of bypass file placed by the managing system that, if present on reboot tells the system to bypass the pre-boot authentication. The file should be settable only through an administrative function configured on management consoles, not locally. Ideally it should be protected by some crypto scheme. Checkpoint, McAfee, PGP for sure have this feature, but I believe most big vendor-owned solutions have it. I don't much care for *how* they implement it. PGP has a command-line command that sets the reboot flag, so a simple administrative-level cmd script can do it. The file may have a counter that is decremented (Checkpoint does) or it may need to be reset each time. I recommend that you deploy the bypass file as part of the patching process so the window is small as possible with only the known number of required reboots allowed.
2) Some systems can be configured to boot to Windows, and use Windows' IP stack to check for some conditions on the network. If the conditions are met, the system stays at the Windows prompt; if the conditions are not the system insitigates PBA and shuts down. On next boot it will be at the PBA prompt. I know of some vendors that do this, but do it really naively. One actually does nothing more than ping a series of IP addresses and if *any* of them respond they assume they are on the right network. Yes, they pin their network location awareness on the fact that nobody could ever think to spoof an ICMP echo response. I discourage this mode in general, even if done well because it depends on a fully booted windows box before it can check. I configured a small lab network to trivially bypass the ping test.
3) There is one vendor that has worked on this problem very hard over the last couple years to leverage vPro and Intel's secure wake-on-lan, and pre-boot environment to provide secure challenge-response based network awareness. If they determine they are on a secure network, they will continue past the boot prompt and if they determine they are not they'll either sit at the prompt or shut down. Oddly enough that company, McAfee, was recently bought by Intel. McAfee's leveraging of Intel's on-board security hardware was the main deciding factor in that purchase, or so I believe.
Disclaimer: My company isn't a McAfee disk encryption customer. I don't work for either company. I just happen to have dug pretty deeply into disk encryption companies and products over the last couple years and my opinion is that McAfee did it right and the others are playing catch up.
Off topic rant: None of the other security vendors seemed the least bit interested in the on-board security features Intel was building into systems, largely because if vendors built product around it, it might make them too interchangeable; replaceable. McAfee was different. Intel got tired of waiting for vendors to kick-start their products, so Intel bought the company that had gotten the furthest with Intel's tools. Personally, I'd hate to be competing with Intel/McAfee on the disk encryption or systems management front right now. Of course, they've still got plenty of latitude to screw it all up.
