Encryption is only part of it. There's transport, elimination of
central storage, anonymity, p2p, etc. Many things people want
simply can't be done with modifications to the current system.
With p2p model and every node as a key/address, you don't
need 'pgp' because the node is the key and does lookups and
encrypt2dest / decrypt2you for you. But you can still use pgp with
the usual tools around message bodies if desired for additional
encrypt/auth or if you're disk isn't encrypted. P2P daemon
takes over and all the old transport headers go away.
Spam/AV becomes another local daemon. Mailing lists are
a repeater node someone runs, or the usual local mailman stuff.
It's a transport replacement, so business can use it account at node.
All the MTA's die off in time.

@_subject: [Cryptography] The next generation secure email solution 
Moving the last couple days talk to this thread seems fine.
Though unclear, that sounds like the old trust of a CA/PKI system problem.
In general I suggest that people wish to use messaging with each other
once they already know them (or have some other trusted web to them).
As in, Hey John, nice to meet ya today, what's your key (address), I'll
message you later. Or Hey Jane, what's John's address. Same for
employers, businesses, etc. Such peer groups bootstrap and grow
very fast. Thus the perceived need for a cold lookup of Ralf, isn't much of
a real one.
Once you know the address (node crypto key), you put it 'To: ',
mua hands to spool, p2p daemon reads spool, looks up key in DHT and
sends msg off across the transport to the far key (node) when it is
reachable. Hopefully the transport looks like I2P/Tor in being a secure
random hop layer. In fact, those could probably be used today, they
have the keys as nodes and user facing ports for inbound/outbound
daemons. They just need scaling work to n-billion nodes (users,
aka: the hard part). People are already plugging postfix, bittorrent,
etc into these networks.
Tor is not currently addressible at the user level by the full key,
it 'shortens' the key into a 16char onion address. As you may be
hinting at... yes, that is bad... collisions, and needing secondary lookup
layers into the full key. Tor may be moving to full key addressibility
soon, see tor-dev for that.
I2P (and Phantom, and probably GnuNet) are addressible with full keys.
So you can send to 'account at key' with them if you want, and keep the
John/Jane/Ralf human style lookups in your MUA addressbook (once
you know them) without needing a secondary lookup layer into the full key.
No, I am not sure. But when looking at some of the p2p transport
layers that have come along so far, it seems like a fairly strong
possibility for a new backend transport model while retaining user
level mail tools... mutt, maildrop, mailman, Thunderbird, etc. Most
of what you'd need there is support for very long addresses and
split horizon handoff to local daemon/spool based on recognizing
what the destination net is... .onion, .i2p, etc.
I'd like to read what Pond and I2P-Bote are doing with some parts of
this as well.
I don't believe you need a trusted CA/PKI service to successfully
bootstrap users and their addresses/keys into a new global messaging
system. If I want to know what some unknown like Bruce's key is, I'll
look it up on his website, social net, list posts, etc. If that's what you

This probably can't be mentioned enough. Millions to billions
of gates on a die, lots of room there. Multiplied out to the
millions to billions of computers in service. That's a huge
opportunity no one in their right mind wouldn't try to exploit.
And RNG's are an easy place to do it. RNG is not a box
you can input 2+2 test vector from the outside and get 4
back out. The RNG may even look random, pass diehard, etc.
But if there's a secret seed buried in the RNG somewhere,
you're screwed. And when was the last time anyone ever publicly
decapped and validated a current Intel RNG CPU? Sure, mix it in with at least one other source, or shutdown, and
use that. But don't ever use it raw. Embedded RNG's help make
the market for external discrete logic RNG dongles.

@_subject: [Cryptography] The next gen P2P secure email solution 
This thread pertains specifically to the use of P2P/DHT models
to replace traditional email as we know it today. There was
a former similarly named thread on this that diverged... from the
concept and challenge of P2P/DHT handling the transport and
lookups... back to more traditional models. This thread does not
care about those antique models, please do not take it there.
In short, we're attempting to examine and develop some form
of new transport that looks somewhat like a mix between secure
anonymous networks, string at pubkey node addressing, massive
decentralized dht-like scaling and finally a user facing daemon that
moves messages into and out of local spools for use by normal
user/system tools.
Pasting in a very rough and unflowing thread summary to date
for interested people to pick up and discuss, draft, etc.
How many times has this been rehashed the last six months?

Obviously. It will never be able to escape the non-body
header content and third party routing, storage and analysis with
any form of patching over today's mail. And it's completely
ridiculous that people continue to invest [aka: waste] effort in
'securing' it. The best you'll ever get clients down to is exposing
a single 'To:' header within an antique transport model that
forces you to authenticate to it in order to despam, bill, censor
and control you.
That system is cooked, done and properly fucked. Abandon it.
What the world needs now is a real peer to peer messaging
system that scales. Take Tor for a partial example... so long
as all the sender/recipient nodes [onions] are up, any message
you send will get through, encrypted, in real time. If a recipient
is not up, you queue it locally till they are... no third party ever
needed, and you get lossless delivery and confirmation for free.
Unmemorable node address?, quit crying and make use of your
local address book. Doesn't have plugins for current clients?,
so what, write some and use it if you're dumb enough to mix
the old and new mail.
The only real problem that still needs solved is scalability...
what p2p node lookup systems are out there that will handle
a messaging world's population worth of nodes [billions] and
their keys and tertiary data? If you can do that, you should
be able to get some anon transport over the p2p for free.
Anyway, p2p messaging and anonymous transports have
all been dreamed up by others before. But now is the
time to actually abandon traditional email and just do it.
If you build it, they will come.
I'm strongly against most the ideas to abbandon current email systems,
because the results will be to create wallet garden.
We need something interoperable with existing systems or the system will
just be used by a bunch of paranoid people or fostered by the marketing
of few cryptography company acquiring customers, not user.
It would be interoperable with current end user interfaces/tools, but not
directly with you at some.dotcom.
As with everything else, today's seeds grow into tomorrows garden, sometimes
you just have to thorougly plow under last year's chaff first, that's by design.
E-mail is basically business correspondence.
    - E-mail is stored.
    - E-mail is sent to many people outside your personal social network.
    - Business recipients of email are often subject to corporate and/or
      regulatory policy constraints that are in conflict with end-to-end
      encryption.
The above list of features can be greatly expanded, and the
consequences elaborated, but I doubt may on this list truly need
to be re-educated about email.
So I will confidently predict that end-to-end secure email will
remain a niche service used by a tiny minority.
Even businesses that one might expect to implement at least encryption
to the "gateway", are in many cases choosing to out-source their
gateway to 3rd-party providers (anti-spam and anti-virus offerings
only work with un-encrypted email, and in many cases the provider
also operates the entire mail store).
[and others also said: tls, dane, skype, smime, ca's, smtp, etc]
Medical, Financial
Nothing here changes, only the backend transport between nodes.
Once your node decrypts the message to your local system pipes,
you can do all this and more with it. Including running a 'business' node
and doing whatever you want with the plaintext after your node daemon
passes it to you. This is not about those ancient protocols. It's also
about 'messaging' not strictly 'email'... those lines are already well
blurred, no need to distinguish between them anymore. A 'light'
messaging client could simply ignore the non transport email headers,
or use your standard msg at nodekey address.
Please do not continue to talk about antique tradional centralized
systems in this thread, except of course to bash and route around them.
The speed of a real P2P/DHT replacement at scale is a research challenge.
this would make an interesting bet!  i too believe this to be
impossible given the constraints.
I'm not so sure about this, look at all the global resources being poured
into traditional email, and attempts to 'fix' it. Now redirect fractional 1%
of those resources and put them into a P2P replacement. That's ftw.
Say hello to Bote mail on I2P.
I2P provides encrypted anonymizing networking, Bote mail provides DHT
based serverless encrypted mailing with public crypto keys as
addresses (ECDSA or NTRU).
 and i2pbote.i2p (if you don't have I2P installed, add
.us to visit it via an inproxy).
There is also I2P Messenger that is encrypted P2P IM within I2P also
using public keys as addresses.
You may have a look of "I2P Bote" it is severless, encrypted mail
system, address is the public key, P2P based... nice tool.
  As in another post of mine, I'll be looking at that again.
My first take was that it stores the messages in the DHT,
which didn't seem scalable or reliable at all. I may be
wrong as I read more later.
I think that's working now. And is the general idea, create a strong
overlay network with a frontend MUA's can speak to.
As an aside: If you can make that overlay net present an IPv6 tunnel
interface on the local host, that lets you use any IPv6 enabled
app over it. I'm doubting the world needs a dozen application
specific overlay networks. More like just a few classes of network.
- message based store and forward
- low latency IPv6 transport
- data storage and retrieval
Bote mail doesn't have to be used for it's anonymous properties, for
me that is just a bonus. For many people it is more than enough to be
able to know that it is impossible for anybody else than the intended
recipient to read the message thanks to public key addressing.
Guaranteed end-to-end security if you can verify the address.
I don't think anything that doesn't fundamentally rely on public key
addressing is the (long term) future. There will inevitably issues
otherwise, including more issues of the type we have with CA:s today.
For those who want to make it more user friendly, nothing stops you
from adding a transparent "address translation layer" where servers
are involved. When you want to send a message to a person with a human
readable address at a server, then the server could then reply with
the public key based address to the mail client, and the user would
have the option to see what that address is. It could even be logged
by the client, with TOFU/POP style trust system that reduces the
amount of trust you have to place in the server. No need to trust
anybody with plaintext.
I suggest such interfacing with the current legacy system will only prolong
it's long past due extinction. Build a better system and let them come to you,
not the other way around. And bolting in exits will only make it harder to
do correctly and optimally what you need to do as a P2P system. Please,
just forget about interfacing with the legacy transport system. If you really
need that you can run your own p2p daemon node that acts as your
automated gateway between the two. This is mostly about design of
the p2p side, not that.
It is my understanding of the proposed replacement for email.  Magic
email addresses that in fact correspond to an identifier of a public
key, for example the hash of a rule that identifies the public key,
and which result in your message not in fact being passed along by
email protocols.
If you're not going to send directly to the very long account at nodepubkey, then
yes, you'll need to create another layer on top to hold your h(key). However,
the key must still be obtainable behind that since that is what the messages
will ultimately be encrypted and routed to. It's not much of a stretch beyond
that to ensure userland mail tools can handle say 8k long addresses. I'm not
against such a [vanity/shorthash] layer.
Bote mail and I2P messenger are two pieces of serverless software that
ALREADY is public key addressed within I2P. Have you tried them? You
need to add the public keys of the recipients to be able to send a
message to start with, although the DHT based search system Seedless
allow you to publish Bote mail addresses to the network.
(IMAP support for Bote mail is planned but not yet implemented, right
now it has a local web interface.)
Maybe Namecoin could work together with them to enable you to register
your key addresses to your nickname in a secure manner, but then you
still have to have a globally unique nickname and tell people the
exact spelling.
Though unclear, that sounds like the old trust of a CA/PKI system problem.
In general I suggest that people wish to use messaging with each other
once they already know them (or have some other trusted web to them).
As in, Hey John, nice to meet ya today, what's your key (address), I'll

I feel like I walking in halfway into a conversation, I'm guessing this
started on the cryptography list that I'm not on.
Your DHT comment caught my attention though.  What in particular about
DHTs don't seem scalable or reliable?
Seems like DHTs are regularly in the 5-10M range and I don't see any
reason that DHTs couldn't be 10 times that.
Any reasonable churn rate and reliability could be handled with
replication.  The bit-torrent DHT for instance claims that 45% of users
that bootstrap from a central node are reachable 15 minutes later.  So
typical setups involve 8 nodes per bin, and 20 bins.  So every 15
minutes you ping 160 hosts, only reach 45%, and do some work to
repopulate the missing slots.
Given the simplicity of the bit-torrent DHT I think there's plenty of
room for improvement.  Larger routing tables are obvious (at the cost of
more network bandwidth to track peers).
The most promising idea for DHT improvements I've seen is to divide
peers into 3 latency groups.  High, medium, and low.   Much like L1
cache, L2 cache, and main memory.  That way common queries are very
fast, yet all queries still to find keys globally.
Bittorrent is already in the 100m node range. That's not enough. This
needs to replace every possible messaging user on the planet over
the duration of their actiive lifetime. That's at least a couple billion nodes.
Don't forget, you can always use disk to cache things.
But at the same time the system has to not say, "I can't deliver your
message to that person because an invisible gnotzaframmit that I won't
describe to you seems to be unavailable to me in the flabogrommit."
Address books as usual. Name layer if need be. We are humans, we
learn new lexicons, we write manuals, that part is nothing to be afraid of.
Being afraid only holds you back.
This is an interesting idea, because it provides certificates on
demand for ordinary users, if they decide to sign up to a certain
site. The
certs are then being used for other purposes, so the site does act as a
bootstap for using crypto. The one thing that this proposal relies on is
the availability of a common piece of software (user agent) that stores
the private key for the user. It's this part of the picture where things
get tricky.
There can be no non-distributed/redundant elements in this p2p system,
aka: no 'sites', certainly none with a realworld IP on them, and none where
very high percentages of them vanishing will disrupt the system for others.
This must replace email, therefore system disruption is intolerable.

Those who require revenue may choose to adopt protocols that assist
product monetization when woven therein, generally towards the limits
of exclusivity and extraction. The protocols themselves stand alone,
and work fine for building things for non sale environments. One can
debate which of the two the internet actually is.
SSH was free and open through 1.2.12, then Ylonen closed it.
So OSSH forked that and OpenBSD forked that into OpenSSH.

What I'm saying in general is that non of these protocols
have intrinsic return to their "inventors", nor do they have
a "revenue only" usage model (cannot be used to build something
that is free).
Yes, same example of SSH history / .com .
That comes from the free and open ness of the protocol development process,
it's not tied to revenue choices by those who elect to use the protocol.
Good point, patents, I forgot that, the one specific exeption to my rule
where the protocol was designed, or at least held out, for revenue itself.
The developer chose to give the protocol away freely as open source.
And earned millions for adopting early.
free open source software / protocols / patent free rfc's, etc
The choice to generate revenue by embedding todays largely
free protocols is yours. Protocols are just protocols.

I agree with the softcore loadable fpga and probe points ideas, they're

All currencies and property exhibit volatility, scandal and theft.
It is a laugh to suggest otherwise, especially for anything 'new'.
And of course there will be new digital currency 'companies'. Let's
just call them what they will be, large central banks and govt's.
But none of them will have the property that their currency is not
under their control. Other than the obivous head start bitcoin has
in the digital currency game, that is what bitcoin offers
philosophically... freedom from control. No company can or will
offer that with their currency. And people are choosing freedom to
the tune of roughly $100M moved per day [1] when they could just
as easily use the current centralized digital currencies of
CC/ACH/wire. If bitcoin itself ends up not scaling well enough, or
being anonymous enough, or resistant enough to centralization...
another decentral digital currency will do better and take its place.
The only real question is, will a decentralized currency such as
bitcoin beat the centralizers in the race to global adoption by the
masses? And similarly to reach point of no return adoption before
centralizers realize it's too late to say no?

@_subject: [Cryptography] What has Bitcoin achieved? 
Thing is, having seen the possibilities, people actually *want*
this freedom from central control, in a bad way, and they're willing
to act to get it. They also realize that if they, and the entire
community, don't act together to maintain the decentralization they
have... then it's over. That's why ghash.io (the largest pool) just
announced that they will not exceed 40%. Down from 55% to 32% now...
And why BTC isn't exactly rushing to support regulation...
Further, again, since people want decentral, if some large entity
does manage a BTC takeover, no problem... all users ok with that
will stay with the now central coin, and the free decentral people
will just exchange their coin (or fork) into whatever is the current
decentral coin. Repeat as needed.
So far BTC has a good history of actively cooperating to avoiding
central. Excepting mining companies (ie: the 10% corps, who have
made similar self limiting statements), the VC money seems to stay
out of the coin itself and is being placed in surrounding service
ventures... exchanges, banking, processors, wallets, retail.
In the end years from now, maybe only three coin will remain...
- A World central
- A State central
- A World decentral/anon/etc
With all of them being roughly similar in acceptance, volatility, etc.
People spend more than a dollar to post mail, or drive to the store.
It will be a long time before the ASIC and electric cost to clear
a transaction (at whatever network transaction demand rate) exceeds
palatability, if ever. Pick a projected compute power, node count,
required tx rate (at 100% utilization) and then basically figure
gigawatt and gigahash dollars per tx.
A guesstimate with current state and data?
- Installing double current hashrate to take 50+% costs about $130M
  in retail hardware alone. Less for a real deployment.
- About $10k/hr to power it. More for cooling, support, bandwidth.
- About $0.40/tx-current spread over a year. Much less if running
  at 100% tx rate capacity. Up to twice more due to doubling current
  hashrate.
Right now that amount is being covered by coin mining profit.
The future taper of coin production vs then current market value
of coin vs tx fees will be interesting. And ASIC platforms have yet
to reach performance plateau. The base tx cost is cost of the coin
algorithm to support a given required tx rate. That seems quite
low. The race (difficulty) to claim the tx fee profit drives it up.
Yet the hardware market is open, yielding a level playing field.
So as long as the required tx rate can be met affordably within the
algorithm, this is unlikely to be an issue.
Cost of tx rates also naturally moderate the proportion of users
amongst each payment system. It remains to be seen, once all the
various BTC costs are fully optimized, if BTC can handle tx rates
approaching the credit cards. Even if not, that doesn't keep it
from utility own natural rate limit.
Some seriously big players don't seem to have any problem with BTC...

I'd agree that actual market float outstanding is thin right now.
Yet different from purely propping things up, speculation is all
about assessing future value and making moves accordingly today...
Not so fast! Yes, Dell accepts dollars (subject to whatever BTC
holdback they, like Overstock, may be specifying). However obtaining
those dollars is totally dependant on Coinbase's ability to convert
BTC to dollars on exchange or privately. And Coinbase is surely
nowhere near whole enough from commissions to be able to back their
contracts against any significant outstanding float in a long price
dive situation. Therefore Dell *is* in the BTC game before dollars
on these sales, regardless of the denomination they're booking. So
is everyone else who 'accepts' BTC. Dell and others are large
companies, with well paid accountants and lawyers... it takes more
than whim of 'marketing BS' for them to put a BTC sticker on their
The BTC market has been in a fairly steady log uptrend over the
long term. The 'collapses' people speak of are, in that context,
spikes returning to normal. All new markets and properties undergo
price discovery. It's a continual process. Ever watch the NYSE,
it's volatile too.
There is no 'useful for this or useful for that' concerning things
riding on top of this tech... the underlying model, including the
social contract aspects, either works for all uses, or for none.
It's either broken or it's not.
Neither will credit/debit cards. Nor is your fiat paper of choice
'real money' either, it's just called money by default. (Probably
because the next default, real property, is hard to fit in your
pocket.) Digital currencies will, like 'money', operate in the layer
above real property.
Again, here's the recycle bin for your trash, this time I'll even
waive the recycling fee... ;)
50% is not a magical binary breakpoint, it merely permits more
influence as the share moves along the scale from 50% to 100%.
Right now, the $130M plus expenses (or $27M plus for ghash) that
is needed to reach 50% seems to not be worth it to anyone.
Who is graphing the cost-to-50%? And the cost-to-50% to market cap,
volume, and quantity ratios? Those would be interesting and important
graphs to watch.
$130M is nothing to someone who wants to own a currency. So why
hasn't it happened to BTC yet? Perhaps because the value of BTC
owes a lot to its decentralization. If so, and you take that away,
you're risking your own value before you start. And risking an
exodus fork.
Just as easy as it was to add BTC to Dell's checkout in N days time,
adding another currency is easy if yours (or your takeover) fails,
or customers continue to demand a decentral one.
And you're not going to win a takeover anyways because no one will
tolerate you blocking their transactions... no entity survives
having 50, 40, 30 percent of its users in abject protest against
theft, loss of value and service, and principle. Among other things,
you'd be prosecuted, sued, DDoS'd off the net, badmouthed, and
forked against.
Probably better to start your own digital currency and put $115M
into marketing and $15M into central hardware.
That only applies to mining 'companies'. Mining 'pools' derive
their share from the users who elect to use them. Of course a
pool could become a company. And a company could uphold the
social contract.
The Ghash was a remarkable social contract event by both shedding
users and users leaving. It's happened before, and each time it
does it underscores the importance of the contract to the currency
to everyone involved.
In the end, if anyone succeeds in taking/making any private/centralized
coin, there will be some users who follow it, and some people who
reject it in favor of other decentral coin.
Digital banking and transacting has been done for decades. Banks
could have made ACH/Wire compellingly attractive to users and the
marketplace. But they waited, and didn't, and lost the chance...
just like telcos lost the internet and music lost itself.
As with those things, crypto in the 90's and overlay networks today,
what is really being tested with BTC along with the tech, are meta
concepts such as freedom, regulation, where value is stored, law,
At the moment it would be quite hard to say decentral digital

@_subject: [Cryptography] Bitcoin compute power 
Holding is speculating a high future price, for which you're better off
simply buying coins as said price usually exceeds interim mining returns
(within your own speculative time-to-price estimates that is).
You mine because you gen blocks of 'free' coins for yourself.
There has always been a shallow ROI+profit period with each
line within CPU -> GPU -> ASIC. That drives bulk petahash buying
to beat the curve. Once ASIC speeds can no longer be improved,
and everyone has deployed current rigs into that ROI at costs
equilibrium, there is no more free profit on new coins alone (even
though some new coins are still slowly coming in as partial cost
offset) and network supply/demand kicks in. To meet costs, you
must then either raise trans fees, or shutdown your rigs. Simple.
The real question is, what will post-max-ASIC-speed
trans fees level out at, and who will be in the game
driving them. Curiously, so long as you can deploy
the same max-speed-ASIC's they have at similar costs,
you can always charge the same (plus or minus a tiny
delta to try for more profit/volume, that depends a lot on
the number of players, congestion, price, etc)... market economics.
Right now everyone's budget calcs are still on mining free blocks
to cover costs and profit so real supply and demand has yet
to set in.

Wuh, false, last I checked unlike other networks, there are no
serialized "coins" being passed around. You're awarded
ownership of a balance in a public ledger by signatories that check
your initial work of solving a hard math problem... the digging your own
gold part of "mining". You spend off parts of that balance by signing it
away to others and injecting that transaction to the net for
validation by signatories (the other role of miners), who then add
it to the ledger. If everybody agrees that todays height is legit, nobody
can go back in time to alter that, because the millions
of people with that legit historical ledger will call bullshit.
51+% only matters to future proposed ledger entries.
Hoarders balance are safe, but will only have use if there's
a good net left post-attack to transact upon. It's hard
to do a targeted attack with small majority. And some
people may continue trading unawares under a growing
majority. It's best to watch the pie charts, forums, and any
warnings from the client alert net and boycott trading until
mining reverts to normal.

Though that's an event you *really* want to avoid. Thus for
their own good people will move off ghash.io. Or will plain stop

And how many dollars on hardware and power would an
'unknown' pool of say government or criminals need to
reach 51% on their own for disruption or profit? By now,
maybe an amount that might be hard to keep quiet.

Agreed there is a lot of trust, crazy trust, and the adoption in actual business
using it (not simply user2user beer and pizza trade), is a bit amazing.
So far it's held up. Try to break it or game it, mathematically or
operationally, huge recognition for anyone who does.
Those with personal money (not mined) in their hoards are on their own risk
decision on that, at least until say the ten year mark and the laws prove out.
Others have mined or can mine, or invest, to recover/recoup their entry
which makes it free for them.
The rest seem to get in, buy a pizza, and get out (perhaps wisely).

Indeed. Many seem to be missing the hidden extension / meaning
of whitewashed quasi-political statements like those of the IAB
that are now coming from various entities, and it's a point that
needs made directly, at least regarding one aspect of things...
It's not anymore about 'should encrypt by default'... continuing
to give yourselves the lazy fallback excuse of oppurtunistic crypto
and waiting for someone else to do it. It's not anymore about asking
your masters for permission to do what is not regulated today, or
giving them seats and chance to muddle / dictate your protocols
before they're developed / deployed.
It's about 'must encrypt' and turning plaintext completely off NOW!
It's about telling all the lazy oppurtunistic fiber tapping passive
surveillors, (who are today breaking fundamental inalienable human
rights not just regulations, and without asking first)... to FUCK
OFF! This is not a time to play nice and compromise... it's war,
one which they started against you. So deploy your crypto now, far
and wide, and faster than the enemy can respond. Mass internet
entrenchment has a winning history against subsequent fiat.
We won the first crypto war, now it's time to win the second one.
Flip the crypto switch, from off to on. Don't ask, don't tell, just
do it.
Mail providers and web services... turn plaintext off!
Banks, schools, utilities, blogs, socialnets, OS distributions,
user applications... the public facing, used by the public, whole
lot of you... everyone, everywhere... just turn plaintext off!
All plaintext transports over the internet... OFF!
Even decentralized P2P applications such as chat / filesharing apps
that wish no model using CA certs, can still enforce crypto by
skipping cert checking under self-signed certs or using [EC]DHE
style crypto session negotiation.
There's no lack of capability or support among all these internet
facing services and apps used by the general public anymore. Every
OS / library can deal with TLS 1.0+ or key negotiation for that.
And you don't need some grand crypto scheme that you all love to
pontificate in endless circles about right now either. Just turn
the damn plaintext OFF and tell everyone to go read the FAQ and
update their end if they can't connect. Then worry about your pie
in the sky later. It doesn't have to be perfect, all you need to
do is shift the game from taking cheap passive global wire surveillance
up the ass, to requiring more expensive targeted active attacks.
Simply turning off the plaintext does that, it's a huge win!
And while you're at it, set up a nonprofit CA foundation to issue
free certs and get it added to the Mozilla and MS cert stores
specifically for the purpose of accomplishing 'plaintext off'. CA's
are useless profiteers who couldn't authenticate their own ass as
customers anyways, and cert stores are uselessly bloated with both
them and enemy entities... so just give the damn certs away to
anyone who can publish a proof of ownership flag / TLS cert on the
forward reference to their own services... simply to quiet self-signed
warnings. Nice to see something like this just dropped as I write:
Pick July 4 2015 as the day to disable plaintext, since by then
everything worth anything will support TLS 1.2 / good negotiation
parameters, and it's a fitting meme.
And if you don't like that flag, hoist another one...
Now quit reading, making excuses and waiting... the enemy will just
stomp all over your flag. Go get started on your code, updates and
crypto configs... you've got a flag day to make.

Following on some related and technical comments...
While my analogy and definition of security may not have been best
suited, nor is this reply, the point remains that there is nothing
special here for you as a corp. Anything you say that LE can provide
for *you* with honeypots can also be sourced internally or from the
open market and your subsequent call to LE to mop up upon discovery
of badness therein.
What is unique here is that LE will be classifying things learned
from the HP's as gov't secrets. That's a hard problem. As opposed
to telling you all of what you need to know to secure your own net
under internal policies and vendor contracts that you would otherwise
remain in control of.
Further, technically, parking an HP on your net only tells you about
what happens regarding via that HP, nothing else. And since you
must distrust this other party HP [1], then all you've got is a
cracked HP outside your trust zone, no different than any other box
on the internet. It's limited vantage point and bogus security
metrics argument.
Sure, the US gov't might be able, on the whole from this, to correlate
and expose more nation-state/international crime sources against
the US and embarrass some foreign diplomats. That's always a good
and fun thing [2]. And the services of LE are indeed valuable.
However do not make the mistake of thinking that *you yourself*
will benefit *directly* from this program, that's not what it's
designed for or capable of. In fact, you will be left out as dog
food in case of 'national security priorities/secrets' arise.
The responsibility for securing your net still rests with you and
you alone as always. The better way to be more secure is to ignore
these silly sales schemes and look same effort at your own processes,
weaknesses, code, OS/hardware, compartmentalization, etc. Maybe
<=1% of that ends up being the use of HP's. Improve those own things
overall and you'll be far better off.
Last, what if one day *you* _need_ to use a freedom network and
they've sybil'd up their nodes *against you*? Be careful what you
ask for and invite into your home in the name of security, you might
just get it... applied against you in time of need.
Well then the solution there is clear... get rid of the MS boxes,
and those who sold and administer them. Like HP's, nothing special
about MS either.
Time limited I maybe not reply further.

Though it is perhaps helpful for them to make such classification here:
a) that's in regards largely to exports, not internal use
b) the phrase is 'arms shall not', not 'things on our list shall not', so
any such classification list is irrelevent. Ignoring the NBC / large arms
debate, crypto is clearly small arms in this context and thus shall not
be infringed.
Crypto is also clearly necessary to the security of a free people, and thus
of/to the state being of the people. And shy of state failure requiring its use

So what is seemed to be said in all is that all of crypto (besides good
XOR) is based entirely on rather fantastical problems we don't know
how to solve today, yet whose solution might appear from some savant
literally tomorrow. (A seemingly quite laughable thing to base
crypto on.)
Alternatively, are there classes of solutions that we have proofed
unlikely to appear within some equivalent bit depth of hardness?
ie: solving problem x (which would break the crypto) is thought to
be at least as hard, or as unlikely to appear, as 2^128.
[x being some problem like efficient factoring]
[Note 'likelihood' could mean not just a singular solution but a
dependency chain of yet to be discovered maths such that discovering
all of them necessary for a break would be likely to be constrained
according to the historical time (mod progression) needed for major
discoveries. Also similar to Drake's calculating odds of intelligent

Putting keys into some_encoding at example.com might cover
some bases related to offline key lookup and message validation.
Most user and system mail tools would need changes to handle
string width and keytype, addressbooks updated, etc. Totally burying
OpenPGP, passphrase and key lookup/use behind a fully integrated
MUA GUI for grandma would work just as similarly well right now today
with no such encoding.
But in the end, all you're doing is covering the message body, and in today's
world that's clearly not enough. No one's yet solving the huge issues
with leaving mail exposed to what is essentially open-for-all-to-inspect central
storage and mail routing. The "who's IP talking to who", "From To Subject,
daemon headers, etc" metadata, when, how much/often, provider logs, someone
sending you unencrypted mail, you giving up your private keys to the
provider or running blobs they provide to you, etc. This is all unfixable with
traditional "Email" models.
This is why that to really solve anything more than the message body,
you need to go completely nextgen and turn that 'email address' into
an anonymous P2P overlay network node address, run your overlay
client [which supplies a mail/messaging front end] and send/receive
mail through that from/to your usual MTA/MUA/messaging toolchain.
The real work there is in pushing the P2P node count up...
- Research how many users globally might leave their messaging
node up 24x7 for a direct realtime overlay connection with the far
end "user at node"... 1/10/100/n*1000 million?
- Develop message storage [and forward/poll/expiry] within the
overlay for those that aren't in online mode.
- Determine any hardware limitations and thin client models.
There is an ongoing thread with the subject
 "The next gen P2P secure email solution"
that contains various people's initial thoughts/framework on this.

If selling to governments for certain of their use cases and inherent

This is probably quite true... from his particular vantage/access point
and social network. Yet however much we may know about that side
being relatively open and shary and the capabilities there, it is not an
exclusive answer to the crypto question. None of the Snowden docs to
date are or show any real details about the crypto side of the house. He
either had no interest (unlikely), had no time, found it too risky (whether
to pull off without being caught, or over concern about some element of
grave damage), or simply had no access.
These sort of things may be important indicators. Yet to prove
them as such you'd also have to analyse the history of
FUD making, grab attempts and so on to interpret.
It could be that selective crypto is not dark, but merely expensive
to scale into being "see all" as desired with the old in clear. So
you would have to analyse the costs there. Electricity, rainbow
disk storage, real estate, cooling. How do you know the disk
makers and their suppliers do not have black wing budgets. Or
that there is not a multi billion fab lab buried under some mountain
powered by a ground radiator / aquifer cooled nuke reactor?
Yes, that's one... who is tracking where all the brilliant maths and
others go after high school? The student names in known friendly
colleges and programs? The ones that seem to drop from the
public scene? What media is publishing interviews with them?
Where are known adversary retirees that may have something
to say when invited?
To know the adversary you must continual analyse all potential
aspects, and not just aspect itself but their inputs, dependencies
and output/result chains. Then maybe you can answer some
questions. After all, the adversary is doing analysis upon you.
It's surprising that maybe no one has yet reverse engineered the binary
blobs/drivers in android to provide a fully open software stack there.
And although more difficult, same goes for the firmware blobs.
Regardless of effectiveness, it would show market demand.
Knowledge, and knowledge dichotomy within capacity of biology as
a whole to adapt evenly, seems quite a potential for scary outcomes...
As with Google, they hire a lot of Maths and others, and have been

Afaik, all vm's today simply pass through all drive commands.
It seems a move all the BSD's and Linux could make today,
without waiting on untrustable hardware vendors to roll out signature
verification in hardware, is to simply kernel block all commands
unnecessary to actual production use of the disk. Permit only
from a list of READ, WRITE, ERASE, INQ, TUR, RST, and so on.
Thus every other command component, including firmware update,
vendor specific, and binary fuzzing, gets dropped and logged.
It could be done as a securelevel, or compiled in.
It's definitely not bulletproof, but it does force adversaries
to add that much more exploit code and effort to
get root and go around the driver interface to access
the hardware directly. Defense in depth.
Similar tactics could be applied to other areas where
firmware and vendor/fuzzable opcodes are involved...
usb, bios and cpu.

Obviously. This is only meant to help protect clean
systems, or prevent subsequent malicious commands if
they happen to go through a user to kernel path that has
for some reason not yet been compromised (say through
the usual /dev to driver to hardware path).
Depends on how the vm is coded. My guess is vm's that emulate
say disk devices, munge those opcodes too. Yes, looking at how
virtualbox and even lightweight instances like jails code/handle it
could be useful. Try it and see :)
In all cases, having the logging capability for non production
opcodes without having to postfilter them out of some
debugging stream would be nice. Obviously again caveat
parts of the system that have not been compromised,
and defense in depth.

Aren't there really only a couple ways to solve this?
A) Somewhat similar to the IAEA, everyone pick their own trusted
and knowledgeable people, then assemble everyone's people together
with orders:
1) Respect whatever soverign secrets you see
 [profits, design advantages, etc]
2) Just tell us what we want to know
 [do the chips that come out of the fab equal the  designs that went
 into it, and are those designs free of trust issues]
This is complicated by needing to insert yourself into those legacy
areas, as well as verify essentially that of B below.
B) Contact your favorite billionaires and pitch the case for a truly
open fab. And yes, that could include starting from ...
Since that tech is already discovered, it would just be an open
rapid physical rebuild of history from transistor to today. Maybe
that would take 10 years of dedicated work to create a trusted fab
that matches todays tech and can replicate itself.
And if you think about it, it could be a profitable venture because
if you did it right, you'd be able to openly and certifiably create
trusted Orange Book / CC style hardware... something governments,
large entities and even users have always wanted but haven't been
able to obtain in affordable quantites and purposes.
This may be easier because there's no legacy to remediate.
And there's no reason you couldn't manufacture private chips too,
the only restriction being that terms that would compromise the fab
are not allowed.

It would also seem that to be injected, your hash+sign algo is broke, or

involved in CSRF or some other three or more way communications ie:

We're not talking TSMC scale tech here, but a basic backyard shed

some USB RNG's, radios, DACs/ADCs, even 74 series and discretes,
whatever works.
Then with that open initial platform, start taking commercial
production contracts (even private runs) to pay for growing the
open fab. Even including openly replicating yourself. What is the
minimum capital and endowment needed to gear up to put 1k, 100k,
500k, 1M, 100M, 1B gates that someone, including makers, would

One can afford what they wish to give to and thus expect to get from
the network in return, no more, no less, as always. (Be it literally
from the physical  NIC network, or the logical networks created by
their applications riding over and within the physical.)
Full meshing of chaff addressed to all participants seems unnecessary.
That's the simple man's kneejerk response when initially contemplating
chaffed networks.
This depends on if you're network is a low latency one, or if it
uses a store and forward model. Even that is tricky due to
needs to hide the size of data each endpoint exchanges from
passive adversaries. It begins to approach constant higher
rate the more you data wish to pass securely.
Then you must wait until you can pass your wheat. Or plan your
needs according to the give and get model.
Delays (trading latency) are not the only way to achieve security.
You may also elect to trade available throughput bandwidth in a
wheat/chaff system.
There were some research references posted in the threads below.
Yes, a lot of oppurtunity exists to create new working networks
in this area that utilize fill traffic and/or delay.
You may want to review the recent guardian-dev and tor-dev side

: Clearly the idea was you design your network so that you do own the link.
: Which brings me back to my question (even Google cannot afford that
much network, I suspect).
Not sure there is a difference between packet and circuit switching
in the adversary sense? ie: How often are you, (as a consumer, not
a tier-1/2 operator) out buying lateral circuits/SLA's along the 3rd, 4th
and further outward rings to reach your destination on the other side...
as opposed to cheaply buying all your access through one provider
and defaulting straight through to the core. Diversifying around a
central problem is expensive, in particular when the problem has
partnered and extended its reach ever closer to the ring you reside
on. So even if you were buying, you'd still be subject.
Strict circuit switching research seems dead with lingering analogs
in POTS, ATM, X.25 and MPLS. And the lack of strict source routing
is a trust issue with all of them as with anything you don't own and
monitor (if that was the meaning of the unsaid circuit reference). If
there was a difference, decades old research would need to be
rebooted and complete redeployment. Not going to happen.
Virtual circuits are alive and well though. Even with some research
and use of source routing, as in Tor and similar networks today
that maintain some list/DHT of available nodes.

Filling unused bandwidth with chaff while encrypting links as

and development in such defensive technologies hopefully resulting
in actual and lasting deployments this time.
Ubiquitous deployment wise... regarding any user oriented, controlled,

ASIC's are indeed a bitch against common human nature.
Yet SHA-256 and ASIC's or not, we need to remember that breaking
that nature takes only 40 random ascii chars to preclude 2^256 exhaustion
(or 50% odds from 2^128). So all other things robust, simply genning
and writing that string down and storing it properly offline is sufficient
protection. Some might even accept char counts of 25 (50%
or 20 (50% or 10 (for 1B ops/s per human lifespan), or less depending
on application. Even 8 (50% for memory's sake (67M guesses
against an internet facing web app is rather difficult to succeed without
drawing admin attention). Suffice to say that 15 chars seems to have
you pretty well covered for life against a billion bitcoin calculators.

There should be no cameras bulk surveilling public spaces, they
are offensive to the individual and their memory thus their privacy.
The only one who could have one there is the individual for their own
purposes... a personal notebook, journalism, research. Not a larger
corporation or the government against the privacy/memory of any
individual... they both can do no more than record their own front doors.
Cameras and databases are an affront to privacy whenever their context
can be or does switch from seeing blurry anonymous mass, to the individual.
Watching traffic flows is one thing, watching plates is another.
Blobby humans moving around vs. doing facialrec on them.
Yes, every individual in office of the government should be subject
to surveillance by the public during the course of their duties when
interacting with other officeholders. LE interacting public should be
taped under policy of the public as vested authority accountable.
But people need to get off the idea that if everybody watches everbody
in one big happy camera pool that all is fair and that that excuses
individualizable and individualized surveillance. And most certainly
in public or databases where there is no individualized interaction,
or permission of individualized recordee, with the recorder. That's
incorrect and against humanity.

Bullshit. Ever walk up to someone and stuff a camera in their face?
They'll tell you to fuck off and delete that shit, maybe smash
your camera, and maybe even smash you. Same as if you try
to troll through their purse, wallet, phone, house, car, or computer.
It's not that they don't mind, it's that humans don't tend to
actively notice and rage against cameras mounted far away.
But it does register in their subconscious and builds a silent well
of rage that will someday explode singularly or in mass. Why?
Because human DNA is a free range animal, not a caged
one, and surveillance and databases are a cage. And like
nukes, humanity is a bit slow to conciously realize those
kinds of errors. The fact that people around the world are
even talking about this should tell you that something's
gone wrong and brakes need applied.
Terror is a fictional infection of news, politics, and the mind.
Rational people would know that, treat it as any crime,
accept it as the price of freedom, rebuild and move on.
Instead the world chose 15 years of ongoing irrationality.

No, you cannot trust third parties, especially ones you do not have

Both the browsers and the CA's are untrustable third parties.

(Though this was about GPA, it's probably also vulnerable to
endpoint interruption attacks that monitor your stream, unless
someone is there making up the padding slack at the far end.)
A wide scope seems hard in a low latency demand based net.
I'd suggest examining some form of next-hop, next-peer, or link

Passive adversaries see only encrypted traffic, not internal
wheat/chaff ratios.
(If considering active adversaries, which this is not meant to
defend against, to be involved in ratios they would have to run
enough nodes to be over half the full path, no worse than basic
entry to exit correlation today.)
Internet access is generally provisioned and billed as... choose
the max bandwidth you want, pay for it whether you use it or not.
Therefore if you have idle capacity within your max at some moment,
you have the bandwidth to dynamically fill it with padding at no
additional cost. It's not a question of buying more to use as fill,
it's about intelligently filling what you've already comfortably paid for.
The problem of observing when endpoints are sitting idle, or rx/tx,
and how much, often, etc... applies to any network today, not just tor.
It doesn't take a supercomputer to calculate this
regarding your logical link to your next hop node...
100Mbps cap - 63Mbps used = 37Mbps fill
That's head in sand talk, of course nothing is free.
Mostly bookkeeping autonomously on and by the local node.
Maybe some circuit signaling / publishing to DHT.
Seems to get more complex if you try to scope
it across the net instead of just to your next hops.

You don't want your secure hardware provider voluntarily

Nor do you want your secure hardware provider to be providing

You need open fabs producing open hardware.

Let's do another 100 post round on the favorite subject shall we...
because serious RNG is serious.
Academics Make Theoretical Breakthrough in Random Number Generation
Explicit Two-Source Extractors and Resilient Functions.
We explicitly construct an extractor for two independent sources on n
bits, each with min-entropy at least logCn for a large enough
constant~C. Our extractor outputs one bit and has error n−(1). The
best previous extractor, by Bourgain, required each source to have
min-entropy 499n.
A key ingredient in our construction is an explicit construction of a
monotone, almost-balanced boolean function on n bits that is resilient
to coalitions of size n1−, for any 0. In fact, our construction is
stronger in that it gives an explicit extractor for a generalization
of non-oblivious bit-fixing sources on n bits, where some unknown n−q
bits are chosen almost \polylog(n)-wise independently, and the
remaining q=n1− bits are chosen by an adversary as an arbitrary
function of the n−q bits. The best previous construction, by Viola,
achieved q=n12− .
Our explicit two-source extractor directly implies an explicit
construction of a 2(loglogN)O(1)-Ramsey graph over N vertices,
improving bounds obtained by Barak et al. and matching independent
work by Cohen.

*This*, moar liek this.
Imagine noise radiator capable of making your spectrum analyzer
look like /dev/urandom across the board. There's no center frequency,
no clock, no freq hopping, no spreading, no observables, no off the
shelf wireless hardware or reference design... it's not based on
that. To any viewer, it's just noise. To you and your peers who
hold, say, a shared XOR key for data and a seed for DRBG noise, it
looks like data... lots of data ;-) With achievable datarate, error
correction, and unjammability governed by the range of spectrum you
can generate noise over. You could even mimic within existing spectra
if need be. The amplifiers and radiators to cover the spectrum are
hardware. Everything else is SDR.
There is at least one good paper on this, particularly involving
GNURadio style SDR as the enabling basis, but I forgot the magic
search terms to find it again.

Traditional spread spectrum seem rather off the shelf

What I mentioned *is* encrypted, both at the RF
layer itself, and at the data layer riding on top.
It's also really hard to locate random background
noise (power). Even if, since random noise can't be

any crypto reason, insufficient cause.

If you've gone from b36 to b58, you might as well go full b94.
At 8 chars that gets you around 50 bits instead of around 30
bits. The jump from b36 to b58 doesn't provide much anyway.
The benefit of b94 is that bumping it to a 'relatively short and
easy to share' length of 20 chars puts you just past 128 bits.
"Easy to share" is not the same as "easy to memorize",
that tradeoff is yours to make. There's no substitute for bits.
Others here will certainly chime in with ways to trade out
real bits for CPU and RAM. It would be nice to have a link

On August 1st 2017, We the People will breathe new life into Bitcoin.
A group of miners, developers, investors, and bitcoin users will

All current Bitcoin holders will automatically own Bitcoin Cash.
The existing ledger at the time of the split is preserved, thus
users retain any balances they had before the split.
Bitcoin Cash brings sound money to the world.  Merchants and users
are empowered with low fees and reliable confirmations. The future

Not since the invention of the Internet itself has there been such a
controversial technological creation as Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the most
disruptive invention since the internet, and now an ideological battle
is underway between fringe utopists and mainstream capitalism.
Bitcoin's early pioneers sought to blur the lines of sovereignty and
the financial status quo. After years of underground development,
Bitcoin grabbed the attention of a curious public – as well as the ire
of the regulators the technology had subverted. Yet after landmark
arrests of prominent cyber criminals, Bitcoin, which actually surged
on election night, still faces its most severe adversary, the very
banks it was built to destroy.

Re: crypto investing, social, politics
According to market cap other cryptos are receiving 44% of the fiat
money input. (Though note that market cap is a bogus metric.)
If users don't evaluate and/or overextend themselves that's their
own fault. Help them evaluate.
If able to borrow from govt / users, that's tricky.
If they borrow at 0%, no problem, sell the crypto and repay.
If they borrow at > 0% to enrich themselves, you shouldn't be
entrusting your fiat to such entities who thereby devalue
and possibly lose and take it.
Not that it matters anyways since every fiat spent into crypto
devalues that fiat ala minimally forex shift.
A couple Golden Rules of fixed quantity cryptos:
- Never sell for any amount less than your buy price minus
any amount granted as disposable risk.
- Hodl, at least until you don't have to anymore, or adoption
Would you accept less than a dollar for your dollar? No!
Yet you accept it every day due to money printing inflation.
If you hodl fiat, you will lose value... there is no point
at which you can execute a stop loss on fiat, except by move
to non inflating asset, or grow it and try to beat whatever
prime and other rates, taxes, etc.
Many cryptos are non inflating (aka: not lossy), and are currently
also high growth.
What's interesting is that borrowing markets are already developing
among cryptos themselves, even extending out to fiat.
Show us a contract from any such institution stating that
such institution itself will guarantee and pay fiat on demand.
Exchanges don't do that, they're neutral, their order books do.
Wallet providers (aka: banks) don't do that, their insurers do.
Insurers don't do that, because they're woefully insolvent
aganst systemic / mass / excess casualty. Including these...
Users hold their private keys against counterparty default.
Most crypto is ownership, not debt. Provided the crypto, protocols,
and network ops are strong... there is no internal confidence event.
Regulation will cause most external confidence events.
Until the swiss bank in your phone absorbs, overpowers, and governs
regulators and other influences causing them.
What do you think last months massive buy in was?
Exchanges and connections tanked because they were chumps
and/or jammed by regulatory limits.
No, they get exactly what's under their mouse button when they
decide to click it.
They were cheated at fiat debt, not crypto owned... a prudent
investors has no current reason to sell crypto.
The promise of crypto and the unwritten compact of its users is
that there is no reason to sell, only to adopt and use it...
The ever growing many thousands of places around the world accepting
crypto prove this theory is working and will continue to do so.
Again, hidden debt, in an open ledger crypto, isn't possible.
You either own it or you don't.
None of this precludes the issuance of crypto loans.

Shorting cryptos works as any other investment.
That's also rather based on some true original
owner (share lender, or simply you) wanting the
things back because think on longer term they're
going upside past the sell, while you get to
play with them in shorter term downside.
Unless they figure it's going up longer term in which
case the obvious applies...
,,, seems they were right, $10k's drop was just a
breather, BTC is $12600 today
Negative balance often means debt, which means another whole layer
enabling asserting, accepting and collecting it, or at least
evaluating lending risk beforehand, and writing it off. Those seem
many years down the road before embedded in a coin system.  Real

The problem with this is that in a crypto ticker like BTC, where
most analyst expectations are for upward multiples, one could
end up throwing away their base needed to realize that CapG.
If it was just some random ticker that nobody wants to
give an estimate on, that would make more sense. But the
spec with "Bitcoin" isn't standard S&P ranges, it's trend 0,
or moon. Since everyone with a brain assumes going into it
that trend to 0 there is an acceptable spec writeoff... HODL,

Cryptos might eat half of gold as storage alone, and

like currency float.
Gold is a store, insulation against fiat, not a practical currency, relatively
flat, creation limitations unknown. Cryptos (ie "Bitcoin") is a store,

Which coins have features, movements, governance in directions
that might in fact allow banks, governments, and other adversaries

Bitcoin is nowhere near private or anonymous.
Genuine cryptographic privacy needed for that, such as found in

technology and tools. Even then some attention to proper

Continued publication and review will yield better understanding

Considering if new crypto is redundant use case and design to
existing well tested crypto families is fine.
Using new crypto in critical applications can be debated.
Simply calling new crypto bad or good without that public
process backing up the finding is wrong.
For coins that offer two modes, any default as to private or transparent
should be left to user choice, with client unset and unusable upon
startup until set pursuant to plainly documented helptext,
with per tx options thereafter. Then this is a non issue.

Blockchain Analysis and Anti-Money Laundering (X-post from /r/DarknetmarketsOz)
submitted 20161110T233518 by Realitybytes_
As promised many months ago, I have attended my first CP session on
AML/CTF for cryptocurrency and I am now in a position to discuss at a
high level what the current state of play is.
While AML issues have not been touched on in this course yet
(strategies and counter strategies will be discussed in session 2), I
felt some of these issues are too important to wait for a better write
up post this time and the overall method they are using to undertake
AML analysis is now exceptionally clear.
I note some of the technology demonstrated to us in these sessions is
very new (been in use for less than 90 days) and from what we are
being shown, it's powerful enough that some significant steps may need
to be taken in the future to avoid being tagged, I will address this
after outlining what is being demonstrated to us.
The current state of play
Not much surprise too many of you who are concerned with significant
opsec, however banks have been indiscriminately flagging every
transaction related to bitcoin purchases and sales for quite some
time, I even raised in this my previous post on AML/CTF.
When I raised this previously, I assumed it was just regular AML/CFT
controls, however I was wrong, this information has been used in a
project I was not privy too, and this data from the banks I have
worked with (in Australia) has been consolidated with many banks
within the 5 eyes and provided to a data science corporate (Palantir)
to conduct large scale inference matching alongside the distributed
transactions that show funds being flowed into the block chain (via
banks, credit cards and KYC/verified website sites) and matches this
information up to begin building out a map of who wallets relate to.
The software is currently being developed to undertake profile
matching (albeit this is only in a preliminary stage) so if you have
sent funds to the same wallet from a different wallet, it will link
them to the owner again (this is still inherently inaccurate).
What this means for buyers
The systems in place seem heavily predecated around buyers not vendors
which I found surprising, with the early reports showing that in as
few as 2 transactions matched between the block chain distributed
ledger and bank accounts de-anonymising wallets which is undertaken
using information relating to a weight price of bitcoin (with
tolerances) and the tracking of the specific value of bitcoins being
sent, due to the finite nature of bitcoin transactions flowing from
bank accounts to wallets this is already being tracked in real time.
leading to the conclusion there are plenty of my peers buying from
markets) as far as we have ascertained, this data is not yet being
used for any purpose aside from mass de-anonymising users, which leads
my peers and me to believe that the movement of funds alone cannot be
used for raising charges, this does raise other concerns at an
administrative level, as it is likely this data could be shared
between government bodies to authorise a "probable cause" warrant on
mail and houses.
I can also confirm that this software was used in the most recent
police sting in New Zealand, adding weight to the conclusion that
judges are comfortable signing warrants on this information.
If you have always undertaken cash purchases of LBC, avoided KYC
requirements and never cashed out bitcoins, you are likely still
What this means for vendors
As detailed above, as the software undertakes bank and transaction
matching to wallets as long as they have never directly cashed out
money from a wallet to their bank, they should still be safe.
This section will likely be expanded on post session two when we
address AML concerns.
Tumblers are useless
Against my better judgement, I’m going with this click bait heading,
but the premise is correct.
Due to the software running real time analysis on the ledger, simply
avoiding taint and breaking up coins is now entirely ineffective, as
it matches the full bitcoin amount to be received over a period of
time, as the software is built around a neural net of sorts (talking
out of school here, I’m not a programmer) it appears to self-correct
in real time as a more "likely" or "accurate" owner conclusion is
Frequently asked questions
These are the questions asked in the audience and their response (not
mine; I have no opinion either way).
How quickly can it de- anonymise a user? If the user has sent coins
from a KYC verified organisation, the wallets sent through will be
de-anonymised in real time, otherwise it will assign a unique primary
key to the wallet once it has been identified as unique and it will
flag all wallets believe to be owned by this user.
Who is this data currently being shared with? The information is
available to all major international anti-crime organisations; however
at this time the  analysis has been undertaken for Australia, New
Zealand, America, Canada and the United Kingdom.
How will this impact other cryptocurrencies? The overall process it
determined to be identical, if there is a block chain to be analysed
and a trade of cash to these coins it is anticipated we will continue
to de-anonymise wallets.
How will this to used to combat the drug trade? The software will
inherently flag dealer wallets in the same process it flags
purchasers; however as the overall end result between buyers and
sellers is the opposite this information will be used to assist law
enforcement to identify volume of sales based on turnover.
 - Are we legally allowed to utilise this information? As
cryptocurrencies are determined to be an asset not a currency, the
existing laws allow this to be  monitored similar to that of any
What about monero? We believe due to the low adoption rate difficult
in obtaining coins and converting into cash that monero adoption will
continue to be low, similar to that of any alternative cryptocurrency.
What measures should now become the default
Under no circumstance should you be purchasing bitcoins from any KYC
verified organisation, and banks should be avoided.
Purchasing in cash is now the default.
 - Wallets should be changed regularly, at a "on a per transaction"
basis is possible.
Everyone should send bitcoins in rounded amounts from 0.25 to 1.0,
this would destroy the entire matching algorithm, if we all just send
coins in amounts of 1.0 it would be impossible to ascertain users if
we avoided KYC.
 - All bitcoin movements should be undertaken via a non-domestic VPN or TOR
Apologies if this article seems like a doom and gloom speech, I am
actually surprised as to how well developed this process is.
I got to play with the software for a few minutes and I was surprised
to see it new I purchased bitcoins and what my wallet was (fortunately
for me, there was no solid line to a market).
If you have any questions, please let me know, I will do another
follow up post my session two, however this is booked in for February,
so in the meantime stay safe and stay anonymous.

Specifically sapling, which incorporates performance,
2nd ceremony, other updates.
This list should really be quite interested in reviewing sapling's
new choice of curves, eg at minimum somewhat rigorous
methodology like...
No different than many other coins, with technology
and demands of the space advancing every quarter,
to which people should be well accustomed to this
as standard nature by now. Same for "volatility".
More media and crap rhetoric from competing coin rivalry.
Of course t-tx are not private, by design. Use z-tx to z-tx if privacy
is wanted.
Of course private z-tx make up only 20%, because t-tx is default,
what do you expect, and users are both stupid and haven't been trained
by those who might know (this list perhaps) into using privacy properly.
The available pool of z coins is similarly limited as a result.
The tin says t-tx and z-tx options exist so user can choose transparent
or private use cases as needed.
Nor do any coins generally implement options for random time delays
between tx, which has unfortunately or not been the realm of swaps
and their counterparty risk and fees.
Whose fault is it that services and users elect not to use z-tx?
Maybe they are not interested that privacy often comes with
cost, even computational cost, so what side are they truly on?
Will they change with sapling, or with future better coins?
'Shiny new maths'... isn't that the realm of this list?
Even a read of the abstract shows as flaws in user usage,
*not* an exploit of the coin itself.
Should a coin baby and encode user usage?
To what extent does babying correct the combined user failure?
Should they have options for distributing coins to addresses in
powers of 10 with sub-penny remainders being sent to charity of
choice? Or for a function mandating z output different amounts?
Decide that and more and bring the results to market.
Here's the actual paper...
On the linkability of Zcash transactions
Jeffrey Quesnelle University of Michigan-Dearborn
Are any of these things really not documented or out in
common knowledge to the point of being exploits?
Coinjoin, Monero, swaps... all just mixes.
Zerocash... cryptographic privacy.
Two totally different analysis vectors.
Formerly linked...
Zerocash... at least sender recipient amount,
expect future coins to get more exotic
with more functions under privacy.
Zerocoin... partial cryptographic privacy.
And now some searches on
zk-snark vs zk-stark
And proof / tx sizes have to be low enough to offer
viable benefit compared to BTC's on-disk accumulation.
Monero is quite a lot larger than anything to date.
Perhaps expect a new coin before long that will be strictly
sapling "z" - sn / st with an interesting airdrop little to no

"The author owns monero but does not own any zcash."
Rephrasing what that prefixed...
Is it *possible* to use whichever coin in a way such that an
analysis paper against it becomes mitigated / moot?
If no, then add the paper to the stack of breaks, and documented
design inapplicabilities / oversights / cantfixes / wontfixes and so on,
that will weigh upon its validity as a coin, and choices made as to
its use cases. "Goes to zero" breaks are obviously included in this.
If yes, then simply bashing the coin as broken, is crap rhetoric,
when the issue may really be better usage, documentation, knowledge,
and design therein so that such footshooting is harder or more obvious.
Given the usage caveats and potential mitigations noted in the
below, perhaps this is really a case of the latter yes condition.
A Traceability Analysis of Monero’s Blockchain
In sum, all the purported privacy coins have years of analysis
and improvements to go before the word private can truly
be considered to apply to any of them. Further, it may
be that newer privacy tech and privacy coins will surpass
any that exist today. Communities getting embattled aren't
productive way to address design / tech, accept obsolescense,
and improve with new.
Change is part of the nature of cryptocurrencies.
The old rules of fiat should not be expected to apply.
There will *never*  be one coin to rule them all,
but many happy families. And every one will be far
different than whatever random stack of fiat notes
might fill the purse of a globetrotter.

@_subject: [Cryptography] NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Round 1 Submissions 
~93 zipfiles
In recent years, there has been a substantial amount of research on
quantum computers – machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena
to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for
conventional computers. If large-scale quantum computers are ever
built, they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems
currently in use. This would seriously compromise the confidentiality
and integrity of digital communications on the Internet and elsewhere.
The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-resistant
cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure
against both quantum and classical computers, and can interoperate
with existing communications protocols and networks.
The question of when a large-scale quantum computer will be built is a
complicated one. While in the past it was less clear that large
quantum computers are a physical possibility, many scientists now
believe it to be merely a significant engineering challenge. Some
engineers even predict that within the next twenty or so years
sufficiently large quantum computers will be built to break
essentially all public key schemes currently in use. Historically, it
has taken almost two decades to deploy our modern public key
cryptography infrastructure.  Therefore, regardless of whether we can
estimate the exact time of the arrival of the quantum computing era,
we must begin now to prepare our information security systems to be
able to resist quantum computing.

Posted on Jun 15, 2017 by Caleb Chen
These are the 4 Senators that want to create a way to track your
digital currencies at the US border
A new bill, S.1241 – Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing,
and Counterfeiting Act of 2017, would make it a money laundering
offense to cross the American border with more than $10,000 in
undeclared cryptocurrency. The stated goal of this legislation is to
bolster America’s “border protection strategy to interdict and detect
prepaid access devices, digital currencies, or other similar
instruments, at border crossings and other ports of entry for the
United States.” Basically, if passed, the new bill would have the US
border patrol treat digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and
Zcash as a seizable asset, opening it up to the great American problem
of civil asset forfeiture.
S. 1421 would have the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S.
Customs and Border Protections agencies to work together and present
Congress with a plan to detect digital currencies at border crossings
and information on the infrastructure needed. Needless to say,
everyone is curious as to what kind of infrastructure would need to be
developed to “detect” the presence of digital currency at border
crossings. Suffice to say, the presence of such language in the
proposed law reveals the deep lack of understanding that our lawmakers
have when it comes to the internet, privacy, and especially digital
Senators seeking to force Bitcoin declaration at borders are out of
touch with technology
With an *****average age of 73*****, the 4 Senators that cosponsored
this bill are:
Sen. Grassley, Chuck [R-IA]
Sen. Feinstein, Dianne [D-CA]
Sen. Cornyn, John [R-TX]
Sen. Whitehouse, Sheldon [D-RI]
It gets worst. S. 1421 also sets it up so that those caught for tax
fraud can also be punished as money laundering, even if there is no
Specified Unlawful Activity (SUA) tied to it. According to Ballard
Spahr LLP:
“If passed in its present form, S. 1241 ironically will take the one
kind of offense which Congress has historically not allowed to form
the predicate for money laundering – i.e., “garden variety” tax fraud
not involving illegal proceeds – and turn things on their head. That
is, transactions promoting a tax crime, so long as they involve a
cross-border transaction, will be the one and only kind of transaction
that can constitute a money laundering offense when the proceeds
represent otherwise entirely legal funds.”
This new law proposed by Senators Grassley, Feinstein, Cornyn, and
Whitehouse should not pass – call your state’s Senators to make sure
that they vote against this heinous bill.

The OS has nothing to do with it, other than the proprietary closed source
blob called Windows that is sold with Intel / Windows tools to manage
other remote Intel AMT/ME instances (ie: in the enterprise and
by attackers).
No. It can be a chip level function. Exactly the same as some
magic WOL wake on LAN, LOM lights out management,
remote KVM key vid mouse, etc all are. Such chips functions
just eat the packets from the physical interface before they get
to the OS, before the OS sends RST, etc.
Further, since nobody has any actual proof or independant
certification process as to what exactly is truly inside the chips
and devices they're buying, one should not be so hesitant to assume
that the damn things are faultless or innocent. Especially given history.
Readers of the Intel docs will also note that AMT/ME only did
works with certain series of their ethernet controller hardware,
at least near while ago labeled with, if recalled correct, an 'L'.
Because those are the ones doing the snooping and feeding
into the southbridge for processing by AMT/ME firmware therein.

No. Not if your "external" NIC contains one of the Intel controllers with
support. These days most of Intel's have it. PCI is PCI, slotted or soldered.
Caveat blobs and secret sharing, one might presume, perhaps slightly less
foolishly, that other brands of controllers don't participate AMT/ME.
Cisco, Juniper, Huawei, Chelsio, etc... all closed source TOP SECRET blobs too.
When even your eyeglasses are secrets, you have no idea what truly
is or is not passing right in front of them.
First you have to get them woked to the predicament they've

Yes, the above disclosed act of guessing would be precisely the case of
all those who reply that have not watched the videos, further evidenced
by their lack of quoting some actual content from them for discussion.
So maybe we must guess the two that follow may mean possible
general crypto areas of:
A) Crypto investing? Perhaps must try to further divine what
components were being thought of in the below note...
Therefore investors investing in Google, or in the traditional stock
markets, or in any other business venture, is also not a fabulous idea?
Google exists to make tons of money [1], and stands to make tons
of money out of any successful offering it makes in the cryptocurency
space, therefore that would not be a fabulous idea? [2]
Or is it that even late comers (adopters) to any investment that by many
analysts (even now by Wall Street) is still expected to outperform
other investments over various timeframes, would not be fabulous idea
to still diversify into that?
Or perhaps it is investing in things that use and rely on crypto, such as
companies or crypto products, or even cryptocurrencies themselves,
in particular any crypto that has no proof beyond powers of two odds
estimates as to difficulty of attack, that would not be a fabulous idea?
What about reviewing, talking about, publishing news of, advocating for,
advertising, even believing in, crypto things, would that not be fabulous
[1] And by extension it's founders boards of directors, executives, shareholders
and investors, including both retail and employee stock purchasers,
employee wage earners, suppliers and customers, etc.
[2] To wit, even Paypal and its ancient model made / makes tons of money.
B) Decentral cryptocurrency tech / regulation / etc vs old world
versions of same
Yes really, decentralized cryptos as a class are generally faster than most old
world transfer schemes... even for each sub component of transfer such as:
preparing to and winding down from send/receive, actual pushbutton transmission
event to first visible ledger entry, through settlement / confirmation
transfer / deposit periods, and any human / digital approval periods,
required pre
and post regulatory paper filings, taxes, etc.

This paper outlines a revolutionary, open source, decentralized
application platform (DAPP) along with its first major application, a
distributed direct democracy (DDD). To create something scalable
enough to run an entire nation with no representatives, we created two
cutting edge technologies to serve as the foundation of the platform:
1] A decentralized, privacy guaranteeing Human Unique Identifier
(HUID) unique to every person on the planet that returns control of
personally identifying information (PII) back to individuals, allowing
for revocable role based access control to that data.
2] A new Distributed Proof of Work (DPoW) backed blockchain that is
immune to centralization because of a unified client/miner with only
one miner allowed per person, linked anonymously to a HUID. Miners are
randomly drafted into built-in pools, meaning everyone contributes yet
nobody dominates. The system provides a workable UNIVERSAL BASIC
INCOME (UBI), i.e., it pays users to participate, since everyone is
drafted to secure the network. It is incredibly energy efficient
because it does not mine all the time and it is also storage efficient
because it uses a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) of historical
blockchain transactions, allowing it to fit and run on a cell phone.

Cryptocurrency UBI effect already happens to holders during
adoption phase, "it keeps going up" vs others on forex, but
thereafter upon steady state it appears
- they have to invest it to earn as with any fiat into stock / bond / biz
- mechanical coin deflation could also effect an apparent UBI of
purchase power up relative to other forex coins
And since "growth" is a bit critically closed loop concerning Earth,
one needs to think about time horizon in which present day
UBI thinking would remain valid vs asymptotic average circular
biometric public key infrastructure, where public and private keys are
directly pegged to a persons biometric details?
DNA has enough bits to create a unique / dependant key,
DNA authentication is still slow, reprogramming is possible
but as yet undeveloped nonproduction tech.
Passwords are supposed to be held in secret mind, and rubberhose
is supposed to be forbidden crime. Biometrics are dusted along
your path to the point of easy failure.
solve this, since it's not possible to, for example, create a new
fingerprint for a person?
See in mind above. If you want more bits there, then you have
to legally expand to allow extension of mind into devices, whether
carried droids, injected hw sec modules, or neural implant arduinos.
Keeping in mind such entities are extremely likely to be
keeping civilian background biometrics forever too.

2) On all physical network links worldwide, every port
automagic and independant... fiber, copper, radio, etc...

b) Deploy fulltime network fill traffic aka chaff, to fill the committed
capacity that each node provisioned itself into the [overlay]
network with, dynamically yielding room for and upon native traffic.

It will fail since its "UBI" distribution must end as long
term the cryptocurrency reaches forex equilibrium and
thus fails to deliver "ROI", unlike businesses that can.
Those without passports won't "invest" aka buy it, nor
benefit from it, thus it'll remain massively underexposed
to free markets. The leading open cryptos will provide much
more "return" to more people before equilibrium. So UBIC
coins, be they pure and simple cryptocurrencies, are moot.
Nor does the UBIC above have any whitepaper or roadmap
in the repo saying anything about what its prospectus is.
Though as with any other coin, its tech might be
useful to integrate somewhere else. Such as
potential form of wallet 2FA, identity assertion
into blockchain, etc.

"Other than" is not exclusion.
Makes no difference what way anyone sees or sells it.
It's just another exotic coin distribution scheme that does
not create anything, records no share ownership of external
ROI producing entities, and can't pull in forex forever.
Further, there's no holdback for faux "investment", or leveling,
so early UBI'ers are made rich, while late's likely remain poor,
and each new pki'd user acts as a forceful tax upon
the "UBI" stream of existing participants.
Though presumably country payouts are population ratios.
Further, the "UBI" mining airdrop it claims to distribute is actually
nothing more than money printing dilution, continuous zero
shifting rebasement, or deflation if burnt... not truly income.
Which again, were it real exernally sourced income, has
growth limitations / unbalances / wars in a closed cycle.
The E-passport pubkey sig verification / voting is interesting,
but can as easily be integrated and treated as a class

Forcing "the masses" to fall to their knees before

Cryptocurrency has far greater adversaries and open technology

They're called storage / banking / service / insurance / payment corporations.
Users are free to proxy their wallet safety / reversibility needs
through one or not. Others are free to blockchain and whatever new tech
advances come around that thus helping avoid third party cost / risk.
Tech is one thing. Personally educating users is also your responsibility
as creators of said tech. Eschew that and your tech vanishes regardless

@_subject: [Cryptography] Loki.network, Crypto Network HW Links, 
Today if play the cut links game, eventually a toggled link
will expose the traffic you seek, because there's no
fill between nodes that automatically takes its place.
Your global monitor sees a respective signal slump
among the nodes making up the subject path, each
node distinguishable by time deltas. Such signal the
adversary was probably clocking into it themselves
for easier recognition anyway... fetch 1MB, fetch 1MB,
fetch 1MB, fetch 1MB... oh noes.
Tor's hidden services are total sitting ducks
because of this. Same for likely all current
overlay networks in production regardless of
whatever service they provide... from traffic,
messaging, storage, cryptocurrency, and so on.
There are surely better links from the bib space,
yet here are some concepts on generated buckets,
retiming, how they can contain full time "empty" fill
that yields to wheat demand on the line, traffic
contracts, etc therein...
If all the nodes are independantly maintaining
independant traffic contracts between their
physical and/or logical peers, cut links won't
do hardly as much impact if anything at all...
A \
B + -----> M -----> { U V W X Y Z }
C +
D /
If nodes ABCD on the left are trafficing through
M cloud fanning out to the right mesh towards UVWXYZ,
then adversary cutout of D is not visible beyond M
if M makes up for D's packet slack on its left contract
by continuing to emit the same amount as fill to fulfill
its right contract.
M could variously blackball A for non contractual
suspect misbehaviour... weird rates, timing anomalies,
uptimes, etc.
M could signal BC that they can now renegotiate
upwards with M since M now has more rate free on
its left.
If M is cut out, the left renegotiates with some
L or N nodes via new northern or southern arc routes.
The "shape" or "bitrate" of the contracts could be
negotiated as need be, "flat" might not be necessary,
so long as the contract is upheld and policed by
all participants to it.
Contracts could be one to one, one to many, many to many,
physical next IP hop to hop, logical overlay address to
address, multiplex, simplex, tunneled, shared, etc.
And pertain to bitrates, timing, uptime, any sort
of constraints, metadata, etc.
This also makes Sybil's life more difficult...
it must now own the full path or it will lose
sight due to contracts with non Sybil nodes
in the path who are also meshed and contracted
out to other non Sybils around ot. Sybil must
also uphold all its own contracts or get
dropped by other nodes.
Copper, Fiber, Radio, etc.. so long as it's quality line
rate hardware that can keep up with its advertised rate,
their time to transfer data is dependant only on distance,
not on how full the line is. Such network hardware is
agnostic... fill, wheat... it all gets there in the same time.
When people say "X latency network overlay", they're
really referring to the cost of software processing
their overlay design on their crappy stack of PC / Phone
CPU hardware. And in their transport protocols running
on the same... TCP, UDP, etc... all the way down
the stack until it hits the real network hardware,
which will either happily accept and ship the packet,
or drop it.
When people cry about "bandwidth", all they need to do
in a fill model is allocate whatever bitrate to it they like
and forget it. They're not going to get more bitrate from
their ISP than they paid for, and they'll probably contract
to the overlay under that so they can do other things with
their line. And they're not going to get more wheat bytes
across the overlay than a 100% wheat ratio (fill yields
to wheat demand) within their contract to the overlay,
even if they do disconnect from their byte transfer
based ISP / Phone afterwards.
Research would need done into routing models
needed to transit traffic across the overlay.
ie: TCP can readily jam more yet slower circuits
through a full pipe, UDP mix gets dropped routed or
reserved for. Raw IP becomes interesting.
As a network HW project for defense in depth...
If hardware makers would add line rate encryption and
fill silicon to every physical port on every switch, router,
and NIC... mandatory on by default per physical link...
that would kill off a lot of vampires.
An open IETF RFC spec for that would cost under $1
per port to integrate into existing silicon port fab
worldwide, plus electricity to drive the port which
would be estimated as part of the RFC process.
Modular agility would not cost much more at scale.
Assuming line rate hardware, there's no latency
impact here either.
If any network application involves free speech,
politics, money aka cryptocurrency, business,
journalism, industry, messaging, personal affairs,
data storage and transfer, basically anything at all...
you can be absolutely certain that many State and Other Actors
have a serious continuum of interest in it.
Is it the responsibility of each application to
develop their own solutions to the threat?
No... probably not when many such apps ride on,
aggregate muddily over, and depend on networks.
All apps can contribute to the development
of a diversity sound number of strongly resistant
networks that they can then utilize and endorse
as they would their own.
Be they overlays on top of the internet,
enhancements to the internet,
or new guerrilla physical plant...
That process of people contributing to
original and ongoing development of new
strong networks that are not susceptible to such
Basic Bitch Adversaries as Global Vampires,
is something more should consider.

Sybil is extremely hard to protect against and root out,
since all Sybil needs is Money, and an Excuse to be there.
As noted in tor lists since years, the solution to Sybil
might not be as complete with only "in network" methods.
It will more likely require at least some in real life Web of Trust,
Humans asserting over the nodes they run, the software
analysing that web, making node selections based on
that metadata.
"I know her, she works at the store, he's at my
meetup group, they're a local company, etc...",
and so on, a mesh of persons to persons, running
nodes and fiber, all around the planet.
You're probably going to need to force Sybil to
become a verifiable IRL Human Being...
because right now all she needs is money,
and her bags are full of it.
In a 1 million node network, if half of the nodes are
from WoT verified humans, each human runs 10 nodes,
and only 50% the users prefer to make exclusive
use of the WoT... that's 25k unique logical nodes now
showing themselves as being more than just a
completely anonymous potentially adversarial
[point] source of money renting out boxes around
the globe.
Can 2.5% of the nodes making up any of todays
transport, cryptocurrency, or application network
overlays be said to be sufficiently trusted?
Do any even need to be?
In addition to signing human WoT data in the network
layers, you could also start pushing analysis of node
metadata into subscribable routing metrics... where
are the nodes located, OS, uptime patterns, spec
conformance, degrees of WoT such as non IRL nyms,
and how strong each asserters verification and assertion
policy framework is, etc.
All of this and more could raise Sybil's cost and
exposure risk qute significantly, perhaps to futility.
Everytime the Sybil WoT subject hits the lists
it's met with abject silence [or "Johnny can't..."]
Is this due to fear of associating with a node
(or trying to protect the node by not associating)
such that if the node is taken down the operator
can walk away or redeploy anon elsewhere?
Is that not what Zero Knowledge is for, to allow everyone
immunity to say "It's just bits, we have no knowledge or control"?
Are advancements toward solving Vampire and Sybil
really thought that horrifically "unusable" and "costly"?
Or that some won't find them perfectly acceptable?
Are the elevated levels of technical, philosophical,
educational, and operational participation potentially
required all nodes and any solutions thought to be
impossible to achieve?
Is it easier to just skate by on the odds and
continue throwing the victims under the bridge
as acceptable losses?
Not meaning to have refer to Loki, or any project, but to all nets...
We know that, other than routine protocol, code, and
human exploits (those three all still being quite sufficient at times),
adversaries remaining credible tools against Overlay Networks
themselves seem to be Vampire and Sybil. And fake Law, no?
It's not only State Actors... any global, regional, or even local
tier-n ISP can be an adversary partner Vampire... all you
need is to be, or have access to, some pipes... and a
willingness to be, or be friendly to, some power, or to
wish to gain from your own Vamping.
And any NGO or person can be a Sybil... all that
takes is money, and in many cases, amusingly little.

Others are a public shambles needing wholesale

To the extent the below applies to any project...
Projects should not hesitate to utilize flag days where useful.
Many projects focus way too much on making seamless transitions.
Users are part of projects too, and have responsibilities therein.
Let them know this, and they will understand.
Cryptocurrencies have been able to make rapid advances,
in part because their very first announcements and ongoing
processes make very clear that there will be flag days,
required software updates, and things users have to do.
Setting those expectations, enabling users to take part
and pride in playing that role, can allow you to swiftly adapt

@_subject: [Cryptography] Implementing full Internet IPv6 end-to-end 
As readers may be aware,
Tor has an interesting capability via OnionCat and OnionVPN
to join its 80-bits of v2 onion addressing with the IPv6/48
bits provided by the latter tools to yield a self authenticating
128-bit host and internet stack compatible private space.
This brings IPv6 (UDP, ICMP, all its applications, etc) to
the Tor overlay.
Tor breaks that with its v3 onions which are much wider.
As does I2P. And of course CJDNS isn't exctly interop
There's an open project for anyone who wants it...
To bring IPv6 over v3 onions to Tor.
The results of which... that being how to provision roughly
approaching 128-bits of stack compatible reasonably E2E
self or otherwise authenticated space out from any wider
space... would be useful to many of the existing and future
overlay networks out there, to bring instant compatibilty
of those nets with all of users IPv6 apps.
Could be anything from a DHT first seen, to an in network
blockchain registry, to an entirely new modular AF_WIDE
compilation library option which could pluggably open up
a lot of overlay networks to general application usage.
See tor-talk list archives and I2P dev for more
talk on the potential project.

Depends on if and to what extent one needs or wishes to speak
to the clearnet hardware that currently exists...
Yes, one cannot rationally overload all 128 bits for that without colliding
upon allocated IPv6 space that may appear in one's host stack.
However the 1:1 key network can be larger than 64 or 80 bit. One could
easily play with up to say 125 bits by squatting on entirely
unallocated space. (Unlike the clear mistake CJDNS made by
squatting on space already allocated for a specific and conflicting
real world in stack purpose.) Obviously the common library widths
of 96 and 112 could be keyed. And request could be made for a
formal allocation if compatibility and compliance was felt needed
by some mental gymnastics.
Agreed, going from say 64 to 125 bits is not the huge or
universally strong and ideal leap that could be sought for.
And there is the question of secure levels and offloading
(or onboarding as it may be)... at what level would many
users perhaps choose to share their cat pictures...
64, 80, 120, 512? And their finances, affairs, work, email?
Were a slider to exist, where would offloading bulk traffic,
of any given content or purpose, end up being set, and
start to occur? How would you run each as needed?
Do you need a future 8192-bit IPvN in backbone routers
and host stacks to achieve certain strengths and utility
goals? Or can you do it some other way?
For reference...
ORCHIDv2 is also commonly noted...
An IPv6 Prefix for Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers
Version 2 (ORCHIDv2)
   This document specifies an updated Overlay Routable Cryptographic
   Hash Identifiers (ORCHID) format that obsoletes that in RFC 4843.
   These identifiers are intended to be used as endpoint identifiers at
   applications and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and not as
   identifiers for network location at the IP layer, i.e., locators.
   They are designed to appear as application-layer entities and at the
   existing IPv6 APIs, but they should not appear in actual IPv6
   headers.  To make them more like regular IPv6 addresses, they are
   expected to be routable at an overlay level.  Consequently, while
   they are considered non-routable addresses from the IPv6-layer
   perspective, all existing IPv6 applications are expected to be able
   to use them in a manner compatible with current IPv6 addresses.
   The Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers originally
   defined in RFC 4843 lacked a mechanism for cryptographic algorithm
   agility.  The updated ORCHID format specified in this document
   removes this limitation by encoding, in the identifier itself, an
   index to the suite of cryptographic algorithms in use.

As before, yes v3 is a great update, useful for many, even indeed
properly set for users by default. But not for all users, as some may
explicitly choose to trade features of one version, say v3, for long
term capabilities still needed from, or only present for the future
in, another version, say v2.
v3 should be "promoted", yet that shouldn't be at expense
or exclusive to anything else, nor should anything else be
diminishing to it. Modularity works there.
And since v3 is now the default, the low cost work
of "promoting" it is now more or less done.
So perhaps v3 can be set aside on its own for now
to consider what "native" might mean in larger context...
Killing v2, while at the same time not working on porting the
curious IPv6 feature to vN, would be a foot shooting regression
upon the future. While easy way out for some to propose,
it's probably not the right approach.
Maybe yes it's about tool devs and users... about apps...
how to see folks using crypto privacy currency overlays
messaging etc, more or less seamlessly, being protected
from surveillance and censorship and enjoying free speech,
scalable production class networks... do you...
a) Wait forever until some critical number or combination
of overlay networks and new apps, necessarily specifically
exclusively and natively written for those nets alone...
is reached, having mass effect at that point...
b) Try to provide extension API's for your overlay of the
year that works with whatever apps people are already using
today, and provide interop API's between overlays, until some
overlays prove resistant enough for general usage tomorrow.
(Recall that tor still emits an adversary warning on startup
and has entire classes of unsolved weaknesses, as
with any other overlay today.)
Or elements of both and add win from both ends.
Or something else or more.
Historically, most overlays have failed at (a) because
native never widely happened, and because of failing
at (b), along with not yet having sufficient attack resistance,
and plain old tunnel vision competition in narrow and
easier fields (say delivering a message)... perhaps are
missing out on some adoption wins in areas where they
are actually suitable enough.
IPv6 is a potential already "native" area here...
Pick any list of "end user" or "server" applications, generally
any IP capable thing out there that people plug into the internet
(these days most everything is becoming IPv6 capable so let's
just forget about IPv4). Well, the millions of apps out there all
speak IP, and do not speak end to end bidirectional onion or i2p
or anything else, let alone ride on or utilize any auth or uniqueness
expectations therein.
Yes, various LD_PRELOAD and packet filter torifying methods
covers some things as a hack.
However the problem is most apparent with apps that include
addressing info in their data not just use it only for binding
the network stack. Or that use anything other than TCP.
Or that need to route, P2P, DHT, etc. Features break or the app
simply won't work. Bittorrent is one such very popular application,
many more exist, or could exist. Many of which might
need to make use of addressing in data to scale, or UDP
for efficiency or mixing.
Further, trying to plug apps into these overlays is complex and
thereby offputting and risky for all but expert users and admins.
Now if you had some simple range of IPv6 for them to bind
to and filter, or even an AF_WIDE, that becomes a lot easier
to adopt and manage as well.
And of course AF_WIDE, or AF_OVERLAY, though it would
require code in all apps, would be a third party supportable
modular library once plugged in as a compile option to the
thousands of popular apps out there.
Engineer something like that and magic starts to happen.
Or since IPv6, crypto, networks, apps, etc are decades old
now, gather todays knowledge for a try at starting from the
top again.
Perhaps a larger aspect is... everyone in the space should probably
be thinking about these things. Are these tools and overlays
just some ad-hoc complex limited usage highly optimized things
for geeks, activists, particular communities, etc? 100k's of users
or less with very limited interop capabilities.
Or is something larger and more important being built?
500M+'s of users, new RFC's and hardware level everywhere,
universal link level full time crypto and padding, are there even
such things being designed. How to fit a picture with or evolve
todays mainstream app and use models. How to get there?
Where is there? When?
Someone should start a conference, not on what attendee
and projects are doing, but maybe on working to discover
the meta of where much of the space should be heading,
perhaps even together.

Oops memory fail as to one bit... today CJDNS really
only conflicts with RFC, not yet colliding with users
in typical environments, as they are unlikely to have
gone against RFC to use the same space.
More space summary later. Sorry, thanks.

How much is search willing to spend on Proof Of Search?
Via Proof of * by search nodes,

Or even PKI to various levels of truth?
Or is that all the fad talk these days?
Of course that involves talk of cryptocurrency,
which was first announced yet now banned here,
which involves applied cryptographic protocols and networks,
which is weird.

@_subject: [Cryptography] What are the privacy implications of bitpay 
The underlying problem is that most coins are
not privacy coins at the protocol level, and hardly
that with most mix, but moreso with better coinjoin etc.
Or you can push out from privacy coins per tx / day / week,
with lots of cost and headaches, or just adopt and use
them natively... Zcash, Monero, many more before long,
as the better overall solution. The point of opensource
cryptocurrency is to evolve and survival of fittest past
the genesis... nonprivacy coins are early legacy tech
and hardly fit and cannot survive privacy and other attacks...
you know much more now, so go and evolve past those
early designs.
No, you're talking to the chain, bitpay reads the chain.
Of course bitpay is a third party seeing both sides, so
they're still vomit compared to direct onchain to payee wallet.
And governments love that middle siphon op. Expect them to
require a checkout ID swipe for that soon... so you have
about 30 minutes to adopt and entrench faster than they
can fuck you over with that too... thanks to you wasting
your time with blocksize and price, instead of adoption
and advancing designs.
If using the complete garbage Gemini backed Flexa SPEDN app
then yes, that's even more severe exploitation of privacy
and so many other things on a whole other level
beyond even Bitpay.
So now brick and mortar retail is trending poorly in
regard true adoption of true distributed cryptocurrency.
Coins without privacy are worse than fiat cash, no
one wants worse, it leads straight to your life controlled
and enslaved hell.
You need to educate payees on wallet ops, conversions,
holdback profits as investment, promise of true
distributed cryptocurrency. And everyone on privacy coins.
It's not that hard.
"Money" is ultimately backed by nothing but belief.
And now there's a much more agnostic, fair and
less murderous choice than Fiat.
So don't let the BankGovCorp FUD propaganda brigade and
puppet masters sway you. Distributed scalable private cryptocurrency
is solveable tech, and you know it's power for you.
So go solve and adopt it.

Completely irrelavant.
Cryptocurrency has evolved well past it's first instance,
well past all such claimants and any silly need
for its first BDFL, and will continue to do so, rightly.
Craig's a pompous asshole, that alone, plus all the rest, including
his no coin privacy stance (a soon to be classwide failure already being
exploited by legacy global penchants and foibles), is enough to discourage
cryptocurrency away from anything he's involved in.
Distributed p2p privacy cryptocurrency doesn't need money,
or copyrights, trademarks, patents, licences, closed blobs,
censorship, surveillance, control, corporations, or governments,
or Craig, to succeed.
That's the whole point.
So stop looking to waste your time trying to centralize
and cheer around central things and people like this.
That will fail in the end.
Instead, put time into getting a scalable, distributed,
and privacy cryptocurrency adopted ASAP.
