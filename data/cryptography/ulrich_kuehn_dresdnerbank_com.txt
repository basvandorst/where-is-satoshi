If you have something in mind one does as in PKCS v1.5 _encryption_
padding for RSA, i.e. fixing the top bytes and adding random bytes until the
remaining length of RSA modulus is filled, then this seems to me like a bad
idea for _signatures_. I could be wrong, but I got the impression that this
might actually help an adversary as he/she does not need to have too much
control over the supposed-to-be-random bytes when doing a multiplicative
attack, again, for RSA. It seems to me that you need some redundancy within
the signature -- like PSS does -- to gain security from random bytes in
Please correct me when I am wrong here...
You'd better hash first; I think I remember that there are some attacks on
fixed pattern padding for RSA even with quite a long fixed pattern.
You might want to look into: Arjen K. Lenstra, Igor Shparlinski: Selective Forgery of RSA Signatures with
Fixed-Pattern Padding. Public Key Cryptography 2002: 228-236. Springer
Verlag 2002.

@_subject: AW: question about rsa encryption 
You have to be very careful in designing and implementing your _de_cryption
routines. There have been some attacks when the decryption is not done
correctly. References are:
- Daniel Bleichbacher, Chosen Ciphertext Attacks Against Protocols Based on
the RSA Encryption Standard PKCS  CRYPTO 1998: 1-12. - James Manger, A Chosen Ciphertext Attack on RSA Optimal Asymmetric
Encryption Padding (OAEP) as Standardized in PKCS  v2.0. CRYPTO 2001:
These attacks are against PKCS padding, and for the method you describe
(direct encryption of a symmetric key with zero padding) I had a paper at
this year's PKC conference describing some attacks.
I hope this helps,
