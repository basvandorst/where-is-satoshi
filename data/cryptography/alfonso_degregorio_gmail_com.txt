@_subject: [Cryptography] What is the format to add multiple signatures 
The standard describes how to work with arbitrary octet strings; it
doesn't have any notion of file. Which is to say that there is no such
thing as 'file name' field in the PKCS / CMS syntax.
I guess what that utility does is to remove the PKCS file name
extension from the file where the CMS happens to be stored. The viewer
then uses the resulting string as the suggested file name for the data
content, when in its turn it is stored in a file.
On a related note: It may be trivial to trick the viewer application
into associating arbitrary file names and/or extensions to the CMS
data content. As the interpretation of those octet string is left to
the viewer application, extra care should be placed on handling those
contents, *including* when the Content Type is signed-data.

Hey dude, this is a tongue-in-cheek pseudo paper written under a nom
de plume just to have some fun -- and invite to reflection.
May I suggest a short break? I surely need to grab a cup of tea.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Juniper & Dual_EC_DRBG 
The attacker replaced Q, a point on the elliptic curve used by
Dual_EC. The attacker did so because, given the point P, it is easy to
compute Q=P*e, where e is known only to the attacker. Whoever has
access to both e and just 30 bytes generated by Dual_EC can predict
future output of the PRNG. And, guess what? ScreenOS was leaking out
the raw output of Dual_EC PRNG, even if it was pretending to use those
bytes to (re)seed a ANSI X9.31 generator -- which would have blinded
the required 30 bytes.
Write ups at [1, 2].

@_subject: [Cryptography] best practices considered bad term 
As long as stakeholders are unable to assess the risks their business
is exposed to, there will be no such thing as best practices. We will
be left only with common practices pretending to be relevant or right.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Summary: compression before encryption 
The work by Demijan Klinc et al. is also germane to this thread.
Klinc investigated the compression of data encrypted with block
ciphers without knowledge of the key. In [1] they propose a
compression method based on Slepian-Wolf coding, exploiting the
symbol-wise correlation between successive blocks of data produced by
block chaining modes of operation, a la CBC.
[1] Demijan Klinc and Carmit Hazay and Ashish Jagmohan and Hugo
Krawczyk and and Tal Rabin, "On Compression of Data Encrypted with
Block Ciphers", DCC 2009, This paper investigates compression of data encrypted with block
ciphers, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). It is shown
that such data can be feasibly compressed without knowledge of the
secret key. Block ciphers operating in various chaining modes are
considered and it is shown how compression can be achieved without
compromising security of the encryption scheme. Further, it is shown
that there exists a fundamental limitation to the practical
compressibility of block ciphers when no chaining is used between
blocks. Some performance results for practical code constructions used
to compress binary sources are presented.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Android's Secure ADB as a security hole 
Sure, there are many ways to exploit access to private keys. Still,
not all exploits are born equal when it comes to susceptibility to
detection. Peter is concerned about a signing oracle that sends you
back the desired signatures through an authorized protocol.

@_subject: [Cryptography] What is the format to add multiple signatures 
With CMS / PKCS multiple signatures can be applied to a message.
For example, CMS / PKCS  allows multiple entities to each sign the
same message (i.e., multiple signers use-case). The same standard
allows also the same entity to sign the message using multiple
signature algorithms. This helps to prevent downgrade attacks and may
assist algorithm migration (i.e., multiple signature algorithms per
signer use-case). You may want to review RFC 5752
