I read that WP report too. IMHO this can only be related to RSA (factorization, side-channel attacks).

I?m wondering why AES-CTR was never included into the TLS standard (there?s a draft). And yes, I?m aware that AES-GCM is supported.
Does anyone have further information? I couldn?t find much on the web.

Wow. First appearance on this list. Somewhat lame though, just dropping of
a link.

Hi Peter,
I've spent considerable amount of time about a year ago figuring out
the patent situation with 1. Rogaway 2. Jutla (IAPM on which OCB is
based) and thus IBM. After some deliberation and a few months of
work we got IPR exeptions from all authors and current (relevant)
patent holders for use of OCB in TLS (yes, this is TLS restricted,
but hey - better than nothing. no restrictions which are hard to
understand or implement effectively).
 (the
draft will be updated within the next two or thre days, I'm still
working on a few details - follow the commits if you're interested)
IPR exemptions:
also: You might get lucky and we'll provide you with a reference to your
aforementioned statement by the end of the month (incorporate hacker
