Well, he does seem to credit quite a few people and companies on his own blog entry about the matter: It does seem he would like an air of some mystery to exist though until he makes his presentation about the issue at Defcon - did he, himself, discover something new? We'll just have to wait, unless we go play with the BIND code ourselves.

Others have previously cracked A5/1, and Mr Nohl's efforts are not news:  but the main thing here appears to be the compilation of the rainbow tables.
Also, it's worth noting that the GSMA has had A5/3 GSM encryption available ( -- PDF) since 2008, but that the improved technology has apparently not yet seen large-scale adoption by mobile operators. - johnk

How does that work if one of PRISMs objectives is to compromise data _before_ it is transmitted by subverting its storage in one way or another?
Forward secrecy does nothing to impact the "work factor" in that case.
I think that "increasing the work factor" would often result in switching the kind of "work" performed to that which is easier than breaking secrets directly. That may be good. Or it may not. "PRISM-Hardening" seems like a blunt instrument, or at least one which may only be considered worthwhile in a particular context (technical protection) and which ignores the wider context (in which such technical protections alone are insufficient against this particular adversary).  - johnk

The technical work always needs doing. It's not that we shouldn't do our best to improve cryptographic protection. It's more that one can always bypass cryptographic protection by getting to the cleartext before it is encrypted. My point was that "mass passive surveillance" is possible with or without breaking SSL/TLS (for example, but also other technical attacks), and that it is often simpler to pay someone to create a backdoor in an otherwise well-secured system. Or to simply pay someone to acquire the data in cleartext form prior to the employment of any technical protections to those data. Other kinds of technical protections (not really discussed here so far) might be employed to protect data from such attacks, but they would still depend on the possibility for an attacker to acquire the cleartext before such protections were applied. I would point out that it was historically the case that the best espionage was achieved by paying (or blackmailing) people close to the source of the information to retrieve the necessary information. The idea of the "mole". That would seem to still be possible. If you yourself the systems provider, or a "bad" employee in your organization, are not handing the necessary cleartext to the attacker?
The issue for me is that it is becoming difficult to know whether one can reasonably trust service providers in the face of coercion. Both for the creation of good-enough technical protections, and the use of them. - johnk

Which have a dependency on languages (where protocols and APIs are languages too).
These sorts of things have been suggested for a while: Write a parser for the input language (protocol) accepted by your program. That parser should have a preferably regular or deterministic context-free grammar.

Yes, good point. I didn't make myself clear enough.
What got me started on thinking about this in relation to OpenSSL is that there was a sense that the protocol doesn't adequately define the heartbeat interaction. I got that sense from this email:  and the IETF discussion referenced therein.

Do you mean the basics of network protocols, or the basics of HTTP itself? HTTP _depends_ on network datagrams (UDP) vs. streams (TCP) but does not itself have such a semantic ingrained (although mostly it trades in request response patterns of some kind).
Mostly, yes, requests have a known content-length. But it's not always that simple [2].
Sometimes there is. Sometimes there is not. See [1] and the following two sections.
Yes, that's true. And then, there's always Websockets (TCP "over" HTTP):  ;)
I dunno, but:
Of course, people have experimented with these kinds of things before:
 and  just to name a couple of interesting ones.

Heh :) Thanks to Lynn's history lesson, I am reminded of the days when "micropayments" were last going to revolutionize commerce (on the web).
And along came SSL, combined with the lowering of transaction fees by the credit cartel...

This response comes close to helping me finally explain my point of replying on this thread in the first place :)
The "architecture" that we have for the Web is grafted together from real engineering concerns about performance, melded with business interests, social interests, politics and a whole bunch of other stuff. These things led (last time) to streams over datagrams over streams...
It's not that one couldn't come up with a "clean" alternative to the existing architecture. It's that if one did, in order to have that architecture exist and persist in the real world, that architecture would be munged together with a lot of other things, many of which are yet unknown (new businesses created as a result of technical innovation?)
TLS was perfectly adapted to its environment at the time it evolved. I think the _environment_ would need to change still more in order for something else to take its place. And perhaps that means going beyond datagrams, or streams? And we would still need to find the 'why' for that.

Because it protects them from customer liability in cases where an individual's data is stolen? And gives them a great story for their customers ("your data is safe with us").
Whether it protects from a "wiretap" though is another matter... one which I presume we will know nothing about until the next NSA scandal.
