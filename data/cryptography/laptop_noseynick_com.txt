I don't believe I'd be revealing anything top-secret if I were to tell you that a certain "BB" company, famous for their 2-way-pager email gadgets and now email-and-voice GPRS/GSM gadgets, is considering 802.11, voice-over-IP, and all other kinds of integration. The idea would be that your office email is already delivered straight to your hip in seconds, but how about your office voice calls, easy integration with your office voicemail, and voice-over-IP so you could answer your office desk phone from another part of the building over an 802.11 vlan or similar?
I think you're being a little TOO cynical. If the customers want it enough, someone will make it. I've often heard the phrase "If you can sell 10,000 of them, we'll make it" around the office. The cellphone carriers don't make ALL the decisions, you know   :-)
