A Faraday cage.
Seriously, what current or historic voting system would defend against
these risks?  We certainly don't want an electronic system that is more
vulnerable than existing systems, but sticking with known-to-be-terrible
systems is not a sensible choice either.

Surely you jest - where else did the term ballot-stuffing come from?
The key, imho, is >=2 independent means of counting the votes.  Online,
as each vote is cast, and a paper trail, for later reconciliation.
It's hard for both to be skewed by the same amount, and differences
will both raise suspicion and give an order of magnitude of the fraud.
That seems to be the direction the experts are heading.

This is a perfect example of what I'm complaining about:  You're holding
electronic voting to a much higher standard than you are paper ballots.
Perfect is the enemy of better.  We do have to take care that electronic
voting does not introduce new and catastrophic vulnerabilities.  Other
than that, it merely has to be better (and no more expensive) than the
best existing systems.
