@_subject: [Cryptography] Dutch govt says no to encryption backdoors 
The Guardian does a reasonable good job of explaining the content of the
I have attached the content in .txt format, and the Google translate
The key conclusion of the letter is:
" The government's role is to ensure the safety of the Netherlands and to
investigate (possible) breaking of the law . The Cabinet stressed the need
for legitimate access to data and communications. In addition, governments,
businesses and citizens benefit from maximum security of digital systems.
The government recognizes the importance of strong encryption for Internet
security, to support the protection of the privacy of citizens, for
confidential communication of the government and companies, and for the
Dutch economy.
Therefore, the government believes that it is currently not appropriate to
adopt restrictive legal measures against the development, availability and
use of encryption within the Netherlands. In the international context, the
Netherlands will voice this conclusion and the considerations upon which
this conclusion have been based."
A quite reasonable and balanced view, imho. At the the same time however,
there is a proposed bill in discussion that would give the Dutch spy's more
legal room to snoop than the last bill that was passed in the USA would
