Can anyone explain how sophisticated those fingerprint readers are?
Are there readers out there that by themselves are secure devices and essentially are able to talk with their servers thru the PCs/workstations over a protocol such that any man-in-the-middle, like a driver, can not learn anything from the traffic?
(...and all that for less than $40, of course...)
If not, would a trojan then be able to capture your fingerprint's digital-fingerprint, and impersonate you from any other node on the network?

Can't you replace the installed root certs with empty files or bogus
content such that they will fail path validation and still trick MS not
to re-install them?

That's actually a sad observation.
I keep telling my colleagues that this technology is coming "any day
now" to a browser near you - didn't realize that that there was no
interest with the browser companies to add support for this...
Why do the browser companies not care?
What is the adoption issue?
Still the dark cloud of patents looming over it?
Not enough understanding about the benefits? (marketing)
Economic reasons that we wouldn't buy anymore server certs?

With the big browser war still going strong, wouldn't that provide fantastic marketing opportunities for Firefox?
If Firefox would support these secure password protocols, and the banks would openly recommend their customers to use Firefox because its safer and protects them better from phishing, that would be great publicity for Firefox, draw more users, and force M$ to support it too in the long ...these protocol would even make the use of one-time-passwords more secure (no MITM exposure - phishing), and make them securely usable without any server-certs...
I was afraid that this cynical argument would play a role... so the server-cert racketeering scheme has just been made more profitable through more expensive but equally "trustworthy" EV-certs, which makes it more difficult to introduce alternatives that don't fit into this "business model"...
On the other hand, I'm sure that the marketeers will be able to sell server-certs together with those secure passwords protocols to the naive customers as it will be very difficult to explain why you do/don't need the certs and why it would more/less secure...

Just to complicate things a little... we're working with a number of  groups now who are using onlineCAs that issue short-lived x509 certs  derived from a primary authN mechanism like passwords or OTP.
It would be great to bake that functionality into chrome: use TLS-SRP/ PSK to authN to an onlineCA to obtain your short-lived cert in real- Frank Siebenlist - franks at mcs.anl.gov
