SYMPOSIUM TOPICS Refereed paper submissions are being solicited in all areas relating
to systems and network security, including but not limited to:
Adaptive security and system management Analysis of malicious code Analysis of network and security protocols
Applications of cryptographic techniques Attacks against networks and machines Automated tools for source code analysis
Authentication and authorization of users, systems, and applications Denial-of-service attacks File and filesystem security Firewall technologies Intrusion detection Privacy preserving systems Public key infrastructure Rights management and copyright protection Security in heterogeneous environments Security of agents and mobile code Security of Internet voting systems
Techniques for developing secure systems World Wide Web security Since Usenix Security is primarily a systems security conference,
papers focusing on cryptographic primitives or electronic commerce
models, are encouraged to seek alternative conferences.
REFEREED PAPERS
Wednesday - Friday, August 7-9
Papers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented
during the symposium and published in the symposium proceedings. The
proceedings will be distributed to attendees and, following the
conference, will be available online to USENIX members and for
Best Paper Awards
Awards will be given at the conference for the best paper and for the
best paper that is primarily the work of a student.
TUTORIALS, INVITED TALKS, PANEL DISCUSSIONS, WIPS, AND BOFS
In addition to the refereed papers and the keynote presentation, the
technical program will include tutorials, invited talks, panel
discussions, a Work-in-Progress session (WIPs), and Birds-of-a-Feather
Sessions. You are invited to make suggestions regarding topics or
speakers for any of these formats to the program chair via email to
sec02chair at usenix.org.
Tutorials (August 5-6)
Tutorials for both technical staff and managers will provide
immediately useful, practical information on topics such as local and
network security precautions, what cryptography can and cannot do,
security mechanisms and policies, firewalls and monitoring systems.
If you are interested in proposing a tutorial, or suggesting a topic,
contact the USENIX Tutorial Coordinator, Dan Klein, by email to
dvk at usenix.org.
Invited Talks (August 7-9)
There will be several outstanding invited talks at the symposium in
parallel with the refereed papers. Please submit topic suggestions and
talk proposals via email to sec02it at usenix.org.
Panel Discussions (August 7-9)
The technical sessions will also feature some panel
discussions. Please send topic suggestions and proposals to
sec02chair at usenix.org.
Work-in-Progress Session (WIPs) (August 9)
The last session of the symposium will be a Works-in-Progress
session. This session will consist of short presentations about
work-in-progress, new results, or timely topics. Speakers should
submit a one- or two-paragraph abstract to sec02wips at usenix.org by
6:00 pm on Wednesday, August 7, 2002. Please include your name,
affiliation, and the title of your talk. The accepted abstracts will
appear on the symposium Web site after the symposium. The time
available will be distributed among the presenters with a minimum of 5
minutes and a maximum of 10 minutes. The time limit will be strictly
enforced. A schedule of presentations will be posted at the
symposium. Experience has shown that most submissions are usually
Birds-of-a-Feather Sessions (BoFs) (August 6-8)
There will be Birds-of-a-Feather sessions (BoFs) on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings. Birds-of-a-Feather sessions are informal
gatherings of persons interested in a particular topic. BoFs often
feature a presentation or a demonstration followed by discussion,
announcements, and the sharing of strategies.  BoFs can be scheduled
on-site, but if you wish to pre-schedule a BoF, please email the
conference office, conference at usenix.org. They will need to know the
title of the BoF with a brief description, the name, title and company
and email address of the facilitator, your preference of date, and
whether an overhead projector and screen is desired.
HOW AND WHERE TO SUBMIT REFEREED PAPERS
Papers should represent novel scientific contributions in computer
security with direct relevance to the engineering of secure systems
and networks. Both the work described in the paper and the paper
itself must be substantially complete at the time of the submission.
Full papers are encouraged, and should be about 8 to 14 typeset pages
using an 11pt font or larger. Submissions must be received by January
28th, 2002.
Papers will only be accepted electronically, via the symposium Web
site, and must be in PDF format (e.g. processed by Adobe's Acrobat
Distiller). Note that LaTeX users can use the "dvipdf" command to
convert a DVI file into PDF format.  Please make sure your submission
can be opened using Adobe Acrobat 4.0.
For more details on the submission process, authors are encouraged to
consult the detailed author guidelines available at
All submissions will be judged on originality, contribution to the field,
and correctness. Each accepted submission may be assigned a member of the
program committee to act as its shepherd through the preparation of
the final paper. The assigned member will act as a conduit for
feedback from the committee to the authors. Authors will be notified
of acceptance by March 25th, 2002. Camera-ready final paper due date is
May 13th, 2002.
The USENIX Security Symposium, like most conferences and journals,
requires that papers not be submitted simultaneously to another
conference or publication and that submitted papers not be previously
or subsequently published elsewhere. When appropriate, authors should
arrange for a release for publication from their employer prior to
submission.  Papers accompanied by non-disclosure agreement forms are
not acceptable and will be returned to the author(s) unread. Submissions will be read by the program committee and other selected members of the technical community for the purposes of technical review, but otherwise will be held in confidentiality.
Specific questions about submissions may be sent via e-mail to
sec02chair at usenix.org.

@_author: Kevin E. Fu 
@_subject: Field slide attacks and how to avoid them. 
We use hashes of marshalled XDR representations of data in the SFS
read-only file system [2].  This allows us to protect the integrity of
public, read-only content without having to worry about simple
splicing attacks.  The eXternal Data Representation Standard is
popular for implementing things like NFS [2, 4].
Recently I've spent quite a bit of time analyzing cookie-based,
HTML-form-based, and URL-based authenticators.  As you might expect,
many of these systems fall to the basic attack you describe.  One of
my favorite bad schemes is from an operating sytems class at MIT [0]
(no offense to my thesis advisor...):
 auth = expiration time + MAC_k(expiration time)
The problem is that an ambiguous message is signed, making this attack
 (username, expiration) -> MAC signature
 ---------------------     --------------------------
 (Alice, 21-Apr-2001    -> MAC (Alice21-Apr-2001, key)
 (Alice2, 1-Apr-2001    -> MAC (Alice21-Apr-2001, key)
An adversary need only create an Alice2 account with an appropriate
expiration time to forge an authenticator for the real Alice.  In the
real world, sites and systems like WSJ.com and ArsDigita ACS suffer
from variants of this marshalling problem [1].  Just sign what you
mean -- using a delimiter or variable name outside the message space
is usually sufficient.

The only person publicly searching for hidden terrorist messages

@_subject: Work-in-Progress submissions, USENIX Security update 
Submissions for USENIX Security Work-in-Progress Reports (WIPs) are
being accepted at sec02wips at usenix.org.
Short, pithy, and fun, Work-in-Progress Reports introduce interesting
new or ongoing work, and the USENIX audience provides valuable
discussion and feedback.
If you have work you would like to share or a cool idea that's not
quite ready for publication, send a one- or two-paragraph summary to
sec02wips at usenix.org.  We are particularly interested in presenting
students' work.  A schedule of presentations will be posted at the
conference, and the speakers will be notified in advance.
Work-in-Progress reports are five-minute presentations; the time limit
will be strictly enforced.
The WIPs session is Friday, August 9, 11:00 a.m.-12:30 p.m. See  for
presentations last year.
Additionally, Howard Schmidt will speak at USENIX Security.  Howard
Schmidt is Special Assistant to President George W. Bush, Vice Chair
of the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board and former
chief security officer for Microsoft Corp.
Schmidt's talk will focus on cybersecurity and lessons we can
learn from the government's response to 9/11.
See  for details.
