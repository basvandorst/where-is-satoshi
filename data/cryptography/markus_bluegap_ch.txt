Agreed, that's a good point against PKI in this case. However, why use a
password at all? I'd also argue it gives a false sense of security.
For that very reason I prefer mailing list software that works via email
(rather than web interface) and authenticates by the ability to receive
mails under the given email. Forging headers doesn't quite suffice
there, either.

Well, that applies to at least 90% of people for 90% the cases. Yes,
often enough including myself.
As I pointed out, there are other ways to achieve that, without the need
for a password. Or actually rather with one-time passwords, instead.
Sure. That's the case either way.
Let's compare apples to apples: even if you manage to actually read the
instructions, you actually have to do so, have to come up with a
throw-away-password, and remember it. For no additional safety compared
to one-time tokens.
The positive point I see for the web front-end is that people are more
used to it. And have a hard time reading instructions on emails and
hitting reply to send back a confirmation token. But your hypothesis is
that people do read instructions, so...

Mailman choosing a random password for you is certainly better, yes. And
closer to the email based OTP solution. It's still a permanent password,
though. By definition, a single interception suffices for an attacker to
be able to (ab)use it until you modify it. As opposed to the mail based
OTP scheme. And the monthly reminder essentially makes an interception
even more likely.
Granted, the worst an attacker can do with an intercepted password
(permanent or OTP) is just a tad annoying - given it's not used elsewhere.
Agreed. It's opposed to good practice and common sense of password handling.

There certainly are bigger problems on earth. And I really don't mind if
you move on and take care of any of those, first. :-)
Please read my arguments, I'm not opposed to it based on personal
preference. Quite the opposite, I actually like web front-ends better
than email commands. But in this case, I think a mail based OTP solution
is better from a security perspective.
I did investigate. And I'm currently using smartlist. Whether or not you
or anybody else "moves" is entirely up to you or them.
If you use mailman, your users better be aware it doesn't follow best
practice regarding password handling, though.
And yes, smartlist certainly has its issues as well. If you know of any,
please let me know as well.
No offense taken. And if it were, you're hereby forgiven. ;-)

While I agree in principle, I don't quite like the tone here. But I
liked your password, though. ;-)
And no: there certainly are bigger mistakes an admin of a mailing list
can do. Think: members list, spam, etc..
For that to be as secure as you make it sound, you still need a password
or token. Hopefully a one-time, randomly generated one, but it's still a
password. And it still crosses the wires unencrypted and can thus be
intercepted by a MITM.
The gain of that approach really is that there's no danger of a user
inadvertently revealing a valuable password.
The limited life time of the OTP may also make it a tad harder for an
attacker, but given the (absence of) value for an attacker, that's close
to irrelevant.

Cool. :-)
Hm.. that's a nice idea, but I don't think it can work reliably. What if
the send path changes in between? AFAIK there are legitimate reasons for
that, like load balancers or weird greylisting setups.
Plus: why should that part of the header be more trustworthy than any
other part? Granted, at least the last IP is added by a trusted server.
But doesn't that boil down to IP-based authentication?
I'm not saying it's impossible, I just don't think it's as good as a
one-time token. Do you know of a mailing list software implementing such
a thing?

While monotone surely uses PKI for signatures on its certificates, it
does not support encryption of data.

Disclaimer: I'm a committer for monotone and yes, I too thought about
adding encryption features, before.
