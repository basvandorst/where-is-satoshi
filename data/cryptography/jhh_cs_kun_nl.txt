But note that there _is_ Grover's search that gives quadratic speedup.

In fact you can! For any efficient classical circuit f there exists an
efficient quantum circuit Uf that does exactly what you describe:
when given an equal superposition of inputs it will produce the equal
superposition of corresponding outputs.

I thought the 3G (UMTS) cellphones at least were going to use reasonably good
crypto; don't know about the overall security architecture though.

@_subject: Security of DH key exchange 
In practice the following method of exchanging keys using DH is used, to ensure
bit security of the resulting session key. If alice and bob exchange g^a and
g^b, the session key is defined as h(g^{ab}). This is mentioned in many
textbooks, but i can't find a reference to a paper discussing the security of
this in the following sense. If g^a etc. are computed over a field F of order
p, and h hashes F to {0,1}^n, under which conditions is h(g^{ab}) given g^a and
g^b indistinguishable from a randomly selected session key k? (where
indistinguishable would mean that the advantage of the adversary of
distinguishing h(g^{ab}) from k is negligible in _n_).
References to this are much appreciated.

Actually, there's the textbook "Introduction to Cryptography" by Delfs and
Knebl that covers provably secure encryption and digital signatures as well.

@_subject: quantum hype 
I always understood that QKD is based on a hard problem of which the theory of
physics says it is impossible to find a solution (if not, then i'd like to
know). Then if QKD breaks, the current theory of physics was wrong.
On the other hand, if DH or RSA breaks, factoring or the discrete log turn out
to be polynomial. This is earthshattering, but doesn't imply our theory of
computing was wrong.
Whether one is a stronger foundation than the other is really a philosophical
question (and a an interesting one too... ;-)
