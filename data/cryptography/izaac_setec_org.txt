The calculus here has little to do with unit profit margins.  It has
everything to do with mitigating product liability suits, recalls,
and bad press.  (You won't read a report of "Chiwonkistan Knock-off
Battery Destroys WidgetCo Laptop".  You'll read the report "WidgetCo
Laptop Catches Fire.")
It is an industry still reeling from a hit of many megabux in a
recall of perfectly good batteries.  I suspect that kind of insurance
is, in their minds, a small price to pay.
