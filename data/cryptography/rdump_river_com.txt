I have a few solid reasons to use PGP over gnupg.
To my dismay, the developers of gnupg chose to embed the command line
processing deep in their software, making doing a proper library-supported
GUI more difficult.  This was the same mistake that made PGP 2 such a bear
to port, etc.  I wish I had the time or skill to fix that, but the reality
is I simply don't have either.
Luckily, PGP 8 actually has a usable GUI, especially from the standpoint of
my non-developer and non-sysadmin friends and customers.  This is the
-most- crucial feature when trying to (successfully) roll out use of email
encryption to an enterprise.  I don't have to develop this feature myself,
which gives me a very solid reason to use PGP.
Also, the PGPsdk is almost always easier to work with than gnupg when it
comes to imbedding OpenPGP into additional products.
On the other hand, gnupg is copylefted open source, vs. PGP's
non-modifiable source release, so if you have more time than money (or
necessity and no money), you can fix the problems with gnupg

Looks like it's cookie sensitivity on eBay's part.  They screwed up.
Doesn't work:
The difference, other than the browser ID string?  My OmniWeb cookie db has
3 prefs cookies for eBay.  The other browsers do not have prefs cookies
The eBay login referenced by those cookies in OmniWeb lists a US postal
address complete with zip code.  Ergo, by typical eBay logic, I am not
allowed to view the item.

In my eperience, the terminology has more often been "confidentiality,
integrity, and authentication".  Call it CIA if you need an acronym easy
to memorize, if only due to its ironic similarity with that for the name of
a certain US government agency. :-)

My favorite versions of that story (also somewhat longer :-):
And for the really extended piece, containing perhaps the entire speech:
Thanks be to John Gordon.
