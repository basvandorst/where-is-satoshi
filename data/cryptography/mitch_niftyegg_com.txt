@_subject: [Cryptography] An alternative electro-mechanical entropy source 
There are some low cost development tools to play
with sensors.    I think some of these offer potential and
are worthy of investing some effort in.
One is:
element14 MEMS Sensors Board Evaluation Kit
element14 and Freescale have partnered together to introduce an evaluation
platform for Freescale's next-generation Xtrinsic MEMS sensors. The kit
features the following:
MPL3115A2: Highly precise altitude and pressure sensor
 - Pressure range: 20 ? 110 kPa
 - Less than 1 foot / 0.3 m resolution
MAG3110: Low-power digital 3-D magnetic sensor
 - Measuring local magnetic fields up to 10 Gauss
MMA8491Q: 3-axis accelerometer
 - Ultra-low-power tamper detection and tilt sensor
Texas instruments has a comparable development board... slightly more
interesting sensors.
So, yes a handful of ball bearing rolling around perturbing the magnetic
sensor a little or a lot.   Voice, AirCon, wind, weather, doors perturbing
the pressure sensor.
Slurp up a data stream from something like this at the end of a USB
link and sprinkle these bits into the bits from the processor RNG and
you have added some serious entropy to the bit stream that I
could confound the risk that the Intel or Arm processor RNG has some
guessable quality.
I see little or no reason to not encourage a cottage industry of mint-tin
size devices that connect to USB links and serve one or more security
functions from RNG to public key ring keepers not directly under the control
of the main OS or Main System Hardware.
Should someone invent an improved or alternate solution unplug one
mint-tin of fun and plug in another.
I should note that the Raspberry-Pi ARM processor appears to have a RNG
and there are are sensor experiments in abundance.
One experiment I might make is an ADC and DAC loop where some input
is read and then an analog output generated to be measured by the
same or another ADC.  The uncertainty of the LSB.
Multiple sensors, multiple methods not exactly the same in many Altoid size
Mint tins might confound
the most skilled external analysis.

With open source code the NSA would be foolish to install a true back door.
i.e. The NSA would be foolish to assume that they could craft a side door
in open
source code that would withstand the scrutiny of another nations security

are not
foolish or stupid.   Their data integrity folk are darn good.
I can see weaknesses to establish a class of ability or a time window.
For example in
the days that  RSA  and the NSA  negotiated the $10M contract FPGA and ASIC
were the tools of a rare and limited set of nations and corporations.    My
memory may
be fading but I recall this time frame and believe I heard "smart" folk
indicate that this was
not clearly beyond the tools of the spooks but was beyond the tool reach of
even organized
crime at that time.  Key concept  "at that time".
I make weakness level security decisions all the time.   I do not have the
worlds strongest
lock on my home.   I have also not replaced the locks on my car.   My gym
locker lock is
an easy to open high school grade combination padlock.   Most of these
locks I can still
open with my eyes closed in moments the same as I could  back in high
Down the road is a high voltage transformer with a lock on it.   OK it
looks like a lock
but is a seal in the shape of a padlock.   It is made of aluminum(?) for
the most part and
is designed to be cut off with cutters.  The same as used to cut heavy
aluminum and copper
cables.   It is tamper evident, it should withstand an attack for a little
bit of time with
a hammer or bashing with a rock.   If a teenager busted in and fried his
little brain till
it burst the power company clearly is not maintaining an attractive
nuisance. There is
no master key to be lost.  It could be made of more durable material like
hardened steel
and more but it does not need to be.
My thoughts on this is that if you wish to be NSA proof you have some work
to do.
All of this does take me to a couple places:
First is a reminder of the Morris worm attacks.
The Dad wrote a book and none in the community addressed these design flaws
and bugs
Jr. crafted a worm that escaped or was let free on the world.  Not zero
day, no criminal
element, no national security enemy.  The BSD folk seem to have learned
this lesson.
Second:  "Target"... clearly criminals were involved ,  national interests
& government sponsored... not likely.
The Price tag of the breach at Target is possibly astounding.  Some credit
companies have eviscerated their limits to limit their risk.   All they
have to do is
write a report.... "if Used @ Target establish limits and throttle the
limit of abuse
and liability".  There are many lessons to be learned here.
Third:  can wait for the new year.
Forth/Fourth:   All things are not equal and too many take two things as
all the proof
needed to take a product to market.   Code reviews and code review tools
work today.   The bad guys are looking at the same code you have.   Clear,
testable....  etc... It is interesting that the word code is used in so
many ways.

What are the risks of compilers with intrinsic functions where
code is inserted in the binary in some cases code that one
might expect to be in a shared object.  i.e. Compilers and
link editors can remove the function call and copy code into
the object removing the ability of a bug fix via shared object.
What caller conventions are safe?

shut down bad code and "force" or "trigger"  an update effectively.

I was not in the security community at this time but I also recall
this as well!
I think it is important that US ITAR legislation had astounding and strict rules
about cryptography as a munition.    A system with the power of a Raspberry-Pi
was under export restrictions.  Recall early M68000 boxes were limited.   Later
any system that had two network NICs was restricted because of adaptive routing
capabilities.  One IPsec project at a largish TLA company was hobbled
back to one
engineer because the market was too small for the legal work required to
deliver it.
I am of the opinion that RSA was operating honestly and shipped the
best products that the law would allow them to have a market for.
That was then!
Today the rules and players are different.  If we care we
have to turn on a bright light and start over knowing that decisions
were made for reasons then classified and now forgotten by all
but a short list of gray haired men and women.  And yes I learned
to program FORTRAN on a brand new CDC6400.

based on the digits right of the dp of Pi itself from
math.h i.e.
   lseek(1415926535897^9323846bits) into PI.  ^ marks what seems sane to me.
Thus the only thing needed is a published value
of Pi with a lot of bits sufficient to suffer tossing
many bits away.
1415926535897 does have prime factors.
But not an obvious power of two (byte, int, long, long long.... cache line)

May I add that the analysis must take into account the ability
to detect an exploit and the value of the exploit over time.
This might be very hard to detect.
To me the bigger you are or more interesting you are the
more important it is to fix.  Time makes exploited data like
a public key a risk for the life of the key and perhaps longer.
This one is especially nasty in that it may have exposed any
data visible to the ssl-bug compromised process.   In the case of
a private key escape the ability to detect future abuse is near zero.
Fixing this is important.  Less so for me but astoundingly so
for any host that a CSS might pull from or any host that transacts

These names are almost silly but what common library functions are close enough

malloc() vs. calloc().
At the point in time that C was born it was an improvement over assembler.  But
that was then....
Another problem in the programming world is the mental baggage
too many folk carry.   In the early public going of "Go" I saw
request after request to make a "Go" interface for one terrible
old "C" library after another.  This caused many of the old dogs to
be kept and not replaced.
I am curious if a reverse mind set is possible.   i.e. Begin recoding
and replacing commonly used libraries with rewritten libraries
crafted with modern tools and modern languages that are
able to link to "C".
One value of this is languages like Python that have more and
more functionality coded in "C" could be improved at a foundational
level by replacing "C" as the foundation tool kit.   Replace Python
with your language of choice.
Emotionally programmers want to work in C because they want to
play with the "big boys and girls".   Establishing an ethic and culture
of value around an improved set of foundations could be a good thing.

COW (copy on write) is an interesting topic for this forum.
The fork(); exec() pair is mostly safe with the interesting
detail bits about effective user and group ID transitions.
The exec(ed) process only gets args but no data pages,
open files and stuff.
COW does imply a book keeping entry reserving space for
any page that _might_ be written to and thus needing real resources
in RAM (as enabled by the sum of RAM and  swap system shared commons).
Not all programs are exec(ed) in some cases the serious
work of the process is done by the fork(ed) child.   That
child does have ALL the data pages open files etc of the parent and
in the case of security credentials that data persists too.
Some programmers will carefully fiddle with effective UID and GID but
might ignore data that trains along behind especially via lib*  data.
The fork(only) context is valuable because on exit() additional connection
and additional data go poof.   Same for things that might make a process
crash and thus isolate the damage enabling a daemon to be long lived.
There is no notification to the list of library activities on fork() so
the programmer must know about and manage any sensitive data
his libraries might own or need or no longer need.
It is this library vector that may be interesting.

What I am seeing is a tool that has some unknown potential
of reducing a symbolic abstraction (program) to something much
smaller and possibly quicker.
Constant expressions are moved outside of loops by
compilers.   Some compilers make algebraic reductions
today.   Logical expressions are also reduced and rewritten.
Some constant expressions are evaluated by the compiler
and the answer or a simplification inserted.
A special purpose crypto tool might be recompiled for speed with the private
or public key as a constant visible to the compiler.  It might be possible
to quicker test a key via compilation in contrast to computation.
Compilation can be hardware FPGA+VHDL as well as software -- C, Fortran, .....
or combination.

The only place where it matters is the use where it does matter.
A simple dice game in Vegas has a house advantage built in.
In craps the odds at times are same for the house and player
but the vast majority of the time the odds are good for the house
and as long as the 1.41% pass/come odds do not shift too far

Also emulation VMs kin to those used to develop android applications
might be worthy.   Emulating an ARM bug on an X86_64 CPU
slams the door on a lot of abuses.
Storage for tricks like this was once expensive enough to
push system admins away from the duplication of bits
but the host OS might constantly monitor all the files
used in a chroot world.
Testing a functional black box like mail or bind might
be simplified as the service protocols are bounded and

input, output, storage...
Some services like bind might well live on small inexpensive

That takes us full circle back to random number generators.
Both for the generation of keys and also for the attacks.
If the RNG used to attack a key has omissions that the generating tool
does not, the attack is almost sure to fail.
If the RNG used to generate a key and has properties in common with the
attack tools the odds might shift by a lot.
This implies that attacks are possible in some cases where both the attack
and crypto tools examined in isolation are very strong but when paired the
result is not as strong as expected.   i.e. if the RNG assumption is fragile
some things fail.   Perhaps enough that it matters.

signed and unsigned can complcate it all. Float

promotions to float or something bigger might happen

A blog is an interesting case.  You can publish a personal key (public half)
independent of the web site.  This can add some additional measure
of credibility that you are you.   In a blog footer you can link to other
blogs or other sites you trust and ask people to add your key to a keyring.
You can attach a new signed image or something with each post.
A web site with a single key that they are not in full control of is at risk
for some class of problems that can only be addressed with additional
secured content.
More than anything you can watch (and should watch) your own web site
(content) and the
associated https key for changes.   It also makes sense to keep a local
backup of your blog and watch
for changes you do not expect.
Web hosting companies might do well to have a page of "staff public keys"
 that customers
should save on their key ring or in a local file same for the big sites.
 i.e. keys that
are locked in a vault, not on line and not hackable to be used to untangle

I should balance John's comment.  Many of the security folk I interacted with
considered the presence of NSA folk to be simply  self serving to
the NSA goals.   The most interesting discussion were over key length and
the limits of ITAR.   ITAR apparently painted a better picture
of capabilities and abilities than anything else.  Internal
laws as seen from restrictions in Israel, France and other nations
further painted ability and bounds.
Internet usenet archives from the 70's to pre Snowden might be mined
for historic perspective.
Comments ranged from being "involved so nothing unknown
to the agency (plural) would be included" to "keep the tools
dumb" enough that they could but others could not and yes marveling
at the discussions where "boxes", tests and more were discussed
was also telling.
I guess my perspective was that all the serious folk took it
all in with a grain of salt.
As for RSA products they seem to have been resistant to public attacks
for a gosh darn
long period of time.  It is not clear (to me) that modern disclosures
have made RSA

@_subject: [Cryptography] cheap sources of entropy 
I am seeing two discussions in this thread:  Getting "quality random bits" and
getting "entropy".
I suspect the difference is important and almost interchangeable but not quite.
Entropy bits do need to be processed one way or another to negate any
observable bias.  Random bits only need to have their distribution
understood and if necessary compensated for.   i.e. some data is not 1&0 data
so a gaussian distribution or other distribution (dice) needs to be managed.
Entropy example:  Cameras looking at leaves through a fish tank with a
bubbler  would have
a color temperature and  other image content artifacts that need to be scrubbed
with a good hash.
Random example:  Radiation detector and a 50% charge pump (like)
device adjusting the
sample rate/window  so the bit stream maintains a nice balance of 1&0
over a long enough
period of time.    Perhaps N detectors and one source for better
capture or improved
data generation rates.
Distributions are interesting.... since language is not random.
Distribution related information
can leak through when the content is processed by a true 50/50 random
bit set.  Some "random"
bits sets should not be true random, simply impossible to predict yet
well chosen to not leak info.
Perhaps bank transactions would look like bank transactions....

Trivial to destroy --- Older flash memory had properties that erase
prior to write
was a block operation.   Writing could be bit as a time... any single bit can be
set and other bits remain constant.   This property made for some interesting
file system designs.  Physical cracking the silicon die of a microSD
card with toe
nail clippers, vanishing in grass or any place all are easy because of
the size.  SD card
adaptors are free.   This permits used data to be changed as used
without a block erase.
For tomorrow's embassy:
A modern device would look like a solid state disk but the disk
controller would be modified/ replaced.   Normal SATA read commands
would return then clobber data (pad pages used).   Random read would
be spoofed (spoofable).
Partition data and tables would omit most of the device so common OS
inspection would ignore the bits.   Any modern SATA spinning media
could have the onboard controller modified to 'lie' and match the
external sticker.
A MacBook pro could be modified to be a OTP by cracking the case
replacing the disk with an "improved" device and modified OS.
Keeping a large key internal on a tamper triggered self modifying
device.   The result of tampering is a spiteful pile of angle grinder
abused bits on the desk/ floor of some agency.
One of the jobs I worked on as a contractor was a disk media and disk
head test fixture.   The task was simple once we coerced the
controller to be a tester.  TLA agency budgets would make short work
of this whole process. So disks spinning and SS could all be improved/
hacked/ secured by controler enhancements with modest effort.
The blocks of flash in many Chromebooks are fair game.

This is a good point, it almost addresses the topic....
There are measures of quality and there are measures of policy involved.
An individual schooled in the art may be required (policy) to use a system
he does not trust (technically). i.e must use but still does not trust.
The policy issue spans three sources: local, transit, receipt.
Technical merit and issues must also span all three and also
reaches up to a fourth policy owner... System and administrative policy
may influence the matrix adding a third dimension.  i.e. system
administrative policy may disallow building raw packets or block access
to port numbers below some set limit.    Transit policy may block
famous ports the way many ISPs block port 25 and other server ports.
In the end the best available will be the best common to all but not the
best possible.
Case in port most companies have a policy of using a Windows OS and
using a specific mail service... and using a specific archive system.
This is a richer topic than the grade school lesson "can I" and "may I".
And grammar police on the internet make it clear how well that distinction
is made... and how difficult the more complex topics of interoperability,
quality, suitability and technical merit devolves into marketing fluff.

so joe-random-badguy cannot insert himself.
With a million your tool may need to manage (cope with) revocations often...
If the document is more than one screen you need to allow those that
sign time (perhaps weeks) to view, read etc.  and then sign.

that they
reviewed.   Recall Radar putting a stack of paper in front of Col. Potter

parallel bit of code will by default commonly run on all the cores and
while that is fine for the one bit of code it is not ideal for the system

This is an ancient problem.
Shared libraries was one solution that does not work for embedded hardware

Correct tool in the correct context... same tool in a different context is
all wrong.
It is not just crypto the same issue is at the heart of some of the
anti-vaccer problems
where an authority declared that he had scientific proof that autism and
vaccines were linked.
We now know that he invented the data out of thin air and all the research
built on
it and all the laws built on it are wrong.  Some might be correct for the
wrong reason.
For cryptographic topics there is a chain of issues that need to be
for the code.
1) simple bug... once fixed at both ends all is good.
1a) an alternate path is needed while the fix is deployed.
2) key generation bugs... fix the bug, generate new keys and invalidate the
3) total blunder -- it does not work and must be abandoned.
4) compromised in unknown ways...
Other issues need to be considered in the context of deployment.
A) can it be audited in use?
B) can it be subverted?
C) can it be used in ways invisible to audit?
D) does it bypass normal inspection?
E) does use invite scrutiny?
F) can policy be enforced or enhanced at a firewall?
I recall the ssh bug where secure shell was
so broken by a bug now fixed that telnet with passwords
in the clear was more secure. Once the server
side bug was fixed system admins could reboot after
enabling ssh again and close down telnet with a window
to transfer new keys as needed.
As the above ssh bug decades ago showed some agility is needed.
Agility can be administrative or automated.
As the arrest of Eldo Kim at Harvard demonstrated as one
of six that used TOR simply using a tool invited scrutiny.
Agility is only one issue.   Consider HTTPS with multiple
keys and multiple algorithmic methods under the hood.
If the likes of Google, Amazon, bsd.edu discover a problem
they can turn one off and leave the other in play.  If agility
is involved the issue is invisible.
Invisible adaption is both good and bad.  At some point it must trigger

Network bootstraps can seed local entropy with the sequence number of

Given the history of attacks based on less than random sequence numbers
in packets sequence numbers are now interesting as seeds lacking
little else.
Consider inexpensive device like the Beaglebone Black, Raspberry-Pi

before local entropy might be considered interesting.   However once

For these dumb devices the flash memory image building process could
include the inserting of entropy/seed unique to each image that is then
replaced by runtime generated different bits.
In some cases the MAC address can be used with care as a crutch in the

The magnitude of these commonly undetected errors is easy to underestimate

FWIW:   The alpha particle cause mostly does not apply.  There was a case

If the goal is too
large nothing will happen.
Pick one service (like mail) and design a protocol that
can be used between hosts.
Mail is a good example because it is store and forward.
At a big service like Yahoo or Google there are many sites
and internal store and forward links could use the new protocol.
At first key management might keep the new connections inside
a service.   Later a pair like Yahoo and Google could exchange
keys then others.
Same for nations.  Some *.gov email services were apparently hacked
recently so .gov mail service might see enough attention to wrap it
in a manditory access control envelope that enforces compartments.
IPV6 adds connectivity options that may allow protocol fences to be erected
they might look like VPN links and have very limited routing connectivity
All that is needed is a specific service and specific firewall rules that
current Cisco
and the like hardware can enforce and audit.
Cryptography is computationally heavy and most services are resource limited
so push-back is expected.   Establishing an on ramp to get services on
program willl be needed.   It took a long time for https to be common but
a vhttps: where all connections are via a VPN to https sites with cached
certificates might be next if http is the protocol of interest.

Davids advice is spot on!
Today there is a lot of open source that is tempting to look at
and copy.   I would advise that you ignore existing source
and build your own code that interoperates with other binaries.
Your work may prove slower or faster but outside of that it
is an alternate code base to test against as long as it is correct.
When you get it working you can submit it to the test side of a project
a testing harness.   It will need to be clear and well organized to
be accepted.
A programmer or hardware type will be concerned with data,
data structures and other fundamental programming concepts.
Make sure programming fundamentals are on your homework
Code in at least two different and contrasting languages.
Python is a good choice.  N.B. most Python gets redone
in C for performance reasons shortly after the design is finished
in Python so consider the two together.
Haskell is a modern language worthy of study.   The great
programmers I know often code in one language to design
then implement in a second for products that ship.  This avoids
gaps that a pseudo language introduces.

I think we agree more than you think.
The large goal is to think big enough that the big boys will find value
and pull it internal where they have full control and then because
they have experience and knowledge know it works well enough to
open up and out to customers.
The small fry are not excluded.
Too large is in the class of IPV6 which is still on many to-do lists.
Yet the bigger the company the more they are working on and with
it internally.
Mail is bounded but still big enough  i.e. It does not include HTTP,  HTTPS,
FTP, NTP or all the other sub 1024 network ports.
Sub 1024 ports are interesting because in the early days
these ports were superuser only and the system manager
was the primary point of trust to limit abuse of them.   Today
a phone or tablet has more compute oomph than those systems
and the result is the sub 1024 no longer has the special place
they once had beyond being famous.

True, yet, Walmart is very data driven.  I would assert that any

that could be used in interesting ways so margin related data need
not be disclosed locally (i.e. a local data check not long distance).
Further in the modern security driven world collection of video of deep
transactions and associated employee tracking could be triggered as soon as
"loss" exceeds something like ten hours wages ($110.00).  Faces on
both sides of the transaction could be entered into face recognition

As you stated a program like this both good and bad.
The international criminals are doing troubling things
so I am inclined to say that this is a good thing.
In the new IPV6 world I see this as a great idea for a while.
But there is always the halting problem -- how to make these
boxes go away.   They consume: space, bandwidth, power, cooling.
They demand access for installation upgrade etc...  unfunded
and unpaid for it is a hidden tax.
Another problem is how to let the device discover enough about
the world around it to be effective.   That process could result
in many quietly owned machines.  If the honeypot signature
was discovered by the bad guys that quietly already own many
machines for some future purpose "badder" things might happen.
I am a fan of honeypot technology but I believe it is too easy
to corrupt and also too easy for the internet to become immune
to a monoculture of honeypots.  It is a known fact that software
test systems fail to adapt and catch less and less interesting problems
as the developer community get immune to the known issues.
For example fail2ban, denyhosts and friends know how to share bogus
I would be willing to share my disallowed contacts with {denyhosts,hpot}.
and get a filtered list of bad actors in return.
A better program is to go back to operating system design and
build a better foundation (including hardware).    One pressure is
the industry that provides virus protection.   If M$ eliminates the need
litigation might follow.
The baby steps we are seeing makes it difficult to squash the root
of the problem.....
In the world of mandated health care I can see a requirement that
anti virus software be provided free to all ISP customers (like flu shots).
My ISP is Comcast-Xfinity and they do provide a no additional charge
I am sure it saves them a lot of spam consuming bandwidth.
One step might be a public POSIX standard for WindowZ.....   That would
alternate systems to be developed and run the same software products safer.
Yes I am naive... err dreaming.

Minor point that should not be ignored.
To a programmer a good hash table is not the same as a good crypto hash.
A programmer simply wants a fast lookup with a minimum miss, collision.
Most programmers do not care if a collision is moderately easy to  fabricate
because they want to get close enough not exactly and will walk their way to
the desired data (short walk).
Crypto hashes need to be nearly impossible to generate by altering the data
input and spoofing a match.
Thus a fast hash for a Google webpage lookup is not the same design need as
a fast hash
for Google data that should be kept secret and private.

Revocation of software seems like a double or triple sharp edge solution.
In a nutshell one could think of it as a global DRM take down.
It could be built into any system package management tool or virus scanner.
Apple, Adobe, Microsoft and many more have a daemon process that checks for
and installs the latest version of itself and of the application collection
under its purview.
It seems to me that any of these could become a problem and should be
the research topic of MAC and other policy management tools.  i.e. an Adobe
should be fenced in and able to only check and modify Adobe products.
One of the strengths of WinNT was a decent policy framework but because
it got in the way of too many things it was side tracked and fell into
MS failed to establish a policy that others could work with.
The lack of physical install media removes one anchor to bootstrap a correct
environment.   Install media for the most part does little to repair and
to risk data.  For example I have ancient email collections that I cannot
because one of 10,000 messages triggers virus scan tools that "do the right

The apparent abuses of DRM take down processes makes the entire

social or political gains is facilitated because some policy designs are
not transparent.

This may open door number two.
Many key pairs depend on pairs of large primes.
However discovering large pairs is problematic so
large pseudo primes get used.
This does open an attack family because finding
large primes that have not been found by others
seems less likely and pseudo primes present a false
view of the number of valuable underlying bits.
For a laptop or desktop to generate sufficiently interesting

I am with you except for the "grab NIST beacon" part.  This implies that

If it can be reset based on an external reference then the jury can be told
the reference is unreliable even if the device is understood...

On an I2C device there is no Read/Write pin that can be cut
to force the device to be read only in the future.  Only audited

I am a slightly cautious about this because I have had
to sift through system logs when time was changing

But in this case there is a file system and it is clear that

would be known to be fragile and in need of replacement
if the extra effort is missing.
In that case there is no "last time" that can be reliably trusted.
The lack of persistent storage is the issue.  A refrigerator
or other device that generates a fresh set of keys each time
it powers up needs hardware engineering.  A factory process could be

that gates read access to a seed and after reading the seed device
once at boot time  it would be unavailable.  Future entropy seeding could
look at it and also for a filesystem cookie combine them and move on.
The first start is a challenge but engineering can improve it. Cost
reductions can make it more difficult.

This important bit is getting lost in the reality of cryptography and
international bad guy risks.
For law enforcement the airtight case anchored with time and location data
a quality storyteller to prosecute an individual who must effectively prove
a negative.
This storytelling is very effective for prosecution of individuals in the
war on drugs.
Tools that facilitate parallel construction and prosecution by good and bad
is a serious social risk.
Consider officer and vehicle video camera records.  Unions in a local city
are demanding officers have access to
the video before completing their action report.  This allows the officer
to tell his story in a way that matches
evidence and is step one in parallel construction,  completed to the
disadvantage of the accused.  Officers
are trained to compose formulaic stories to make a case.
Parallel construction is not effective in the context of war between
nations or international groups.
Some would insert that Bush-2 constructed a threat to justify war.
Information and intent in communications with the controlling nation state
(with or without borders)  has value
here and is both easy to forge and difficult to obtain.   In this case
cryptography has proved a valuable and
serious tool in the conduct of offensive and defensive actions.  Enigma,
Purple, Magic...
The important side note is that storytellers are key.   Pundits on media
outlets are
story tellers.   Occasionally we see a fact rich discussion with an expert
by and large we are seeing professional storytellers paid to entertain and
gather eyeballs.
These two contexts -- prosecution under the law  and prosecution of
international crime and war are different.
A third context is competitive business communications.  Sony hack comes to
but while non violent it is often an international crime outside the reach
of US law
for the most part.   Cryptography is very important here.  Weakening
risks domestic and international commerce and fair play.  This alone covers
the strong encryption inside of Google.
The point I do not want to be lost is that law enforcement and citizens
need evidentiary tools in
contrast to parallel construction tools.    Stingray and licence plate
readers are serious tools for
parallel construction.   Encryption is 99 44/100% not a domestic crime
issue.  Storytellers
want parallel construction tools...

phone and service providers view software as a mechanism of

devices.  Samsung+AT&T seem to limit devices to one perhaps two updates
and at best two years starting at introduction (not sale).
What this presents is a context where most phones older than 18 months
are not going to be updated to include a side or back door to the OS.
Applications for the older hardware need not be installed and as
such cannot be altered.   Legislation to force pushing updates would
be seen as a massive imposition on the business plans of these companies.
What this implies is any secondary market for phones to include
phones for abused women, the elderly and more would have to
be closed for fear that untraceable devices cannot be diverted.

methods known
to be flawed.  Key length limitations, encryption methods etc.

We had a 6400 at the Univ of  Arizona in the '60s.
In the first year all jobs were run twice.  Once on the old IBM and
again  on the 6400.   One of the big advantages was the speed of
the IO hardware.   Cards were transported from the input window in
the old building read on the card reader of the 6600 to a pair of tapes
one tape set was run local and the other run on the old IBM.
Commonly the 6400 was finished near midnight while the IBM labored
till dawn.  The operator would drop the day file and reboot... he and I
would then
program at the console using the room of hardware as a personal computer.
The interesting bit from a security world view is how the OS was loaded
and how jobs were managed by SCOPE.   The generation of key pairs
is an interesting & important activity well justified for buildings
modest hardware systems where Unix and Windows do not make sense.
I suspect a number of lessons from these historic system designs
have value ignored by too many "kids" that have grown up only with our

...snip good stuff......
What little I know is that there are more than two reasons.
With a good cypher it is difficult or impossible to know how the data was
obscured without being told.  Given this it is also nearly impossible to
externally that a method or key or both change.
Many times we talk about a key or method that had 2^64 or 2^1024
or pick a number.   When two methods are possible an attacker must
attack 2^65 different permutations or 2^1025.  Sometimes doubling
the effective key length doubles a search space.   Expanding the method
list to one of any vastly complicates an attack.   The users may know
their key but the method may be unknown to the users yet known and
controlled to the management.    This is in effect a multi part key.
A common phrase associated with redacted documents and litigation of
crimes involving secrets is that "methods and techniques" are important
and a vast amount of energy is spent to keep methods secret.

Attempting to establish a policy for _everything_ is hard if not impossible.
However some activities like an apache web server do have well bounded
activities and lend themselves to many types of containerization.
Some policy systems make objects outside of your label set invisible.

@_subject: [Cryptography] trojans in the firmware 
My new Raspberry Pi is effectively unchanged from previous.  The SD card
and connector has been replaced
with a microSD card which permits a much better connector.  There is flash
boot ROM that is smart enough to bootstrap
a uboot chain and eventually something interesting.   That flash is not
visible from the processor might still
be available to a JTAG scan.
The Beaglebone Black flash boot code searches the onboard 2GB of nand flash
and would boot that, lacking
boot code there or seeing a "boot from mSD switch state"  on the card the
BBB will boot  from a micro SD card.
Some developers write 0x00 on the flash and test using the mSD card.
Flashing the nand flash memory can
take 40 min and then requires a reboot. So mSD is quicker to boot and test
from but not as fast for IO.
Having a large mSD card is another value.
Hacking hard disk microcode is double trouble.   Once the microcode has
been hacked all the spare
blocks and spare tracks are available to store rather heavy payloads.
These cannot be accessed unless
the hacked microcode allows (not likely).  To repair would require access
with a JTAG tester or other i2c
bus like side door if the design allows.    It is possible with physical
access to disconnect the read write heads
and position logic replacing them with a "known good" board and explore the
media.   Modern controllers have
rather airtight hardware blocks that prevent read access to stored bits.
In some a fuse link can make the lock
permanent.  Some disks keep boot bits and defect bits on spinning media and
have a hard coded boot ROM in
the processor itself. That can then boot from the spinning media.   Once
that control software is hacked on a
disk drive almost anything is possible given the heavy but hidden payload
that it can play with.
Instrumenting a drive might detect anomalies without disassembly.  If and
only if the media and signal
lines are buffered sufficiently can data bits be read by snooping on the
device and head control logic.

Algorithmic random number generators are everywhere, used for all kinds of
tasks, from simulation to computational creativity.
Yet most people haven't given much thought to the random number generators
they use. Is the RNG you're using a good source of randomness? What does it
even mean to be a good RNG?
In this talk, we will examine the desirable properties of a random number
generator including performance, correctness, uniformity, and
unpredictability, as well as sound mathematical grounding.
We will observe how the RNGs in widespread use lack desirable properties
(most commonly failing statistical tests for randomness).
Then we will show how a simple twist on a venerable-but-flawed RNG
technique can provide all the properties we desire, resulting in the PCG
family of RNGs.

I did see a link to one paper on this in a previous reply...
Defending often involves the system admin of the far system
accepting the public half and installing it in ~/.ssh for you.
They often disallow ssh with a password for incoming connections.
It is also valuable to promptly  "scp -r ~/pubsshbits/  user at farhost:~/.ssh"
This gives a single ssh-login with password cycle to capture and analyse.
Test the ssh connection then set a fresh password.
The paranoid might also retire the initial public key installed by
the system admin for you assuming it was vacuumed up in transit and
tossed into a system to be abused and perhaps cracked.  The site
admin (root) will commonly have access to your ~/.ssh dir so
take a measure and manage the secret half of keys with care.
Most attacks take some non zero amount of time to process and analyse
to promptly changing keys and passwords can quickly invalidate the result
of that
analysis before they get to use it.  See the man page for ssh and friends...
Check "ssh -i yourmagicfile"
  -i identity_file
             Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for
public key authentication is read.  The default is ~/.ssh/identity
             for protocol version 1, and ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa,
~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and ~/.ssh/id_rsa for protocol version 2.
             Identity files may also be specified on a per-host basis in
the configuration file.  It is possible to have multiple -i
             options (and multiple identities specified in configuration
files).  ssh will also try to load certificate information from

One additional comment... if compression proves to be very efficient on
the message then the message is fragile and possibly easy to attack because
has a lot of redundancy.
Compressed files do have sufficient structure that might also  prove to be
sufficient valuable "known" to leverage an attack with.  Compression bombs
as part of
the payload might be a defensive strategy or just make the snooper angry.
mixing compression tools and applying layers of compression might result in
smaller files but yet may not have compression artifacts that are easy to
Transmitting compressed files requires the advisory to decompress the file
to discover that it needs further inspection complicating automated
snooping processes.
The best answer is not obvious if bandwidth and storage  are inexpensive
and fast.

Well chosen, yes...
A compressed file has more "known" structure than just the header.
A large pile of encrypted files with a known structure and a common key
could be all that modern tools in Utah need to attack the key.
If compression after encryption is a net gain that would be more secure.
If compression was first than knowing how the initial data was compressed
may a loss of security as the hint is "it was compressed with ___"
A good encryption and no knowledge that the content was compressed first
would be fine.   Some compression tools have a notion of a compression
preset level which might be used when the same file is sent multiple times

TTL values
and answers as they change over time from multiple DNS servers.
It is troubling to think that I could reach out to an IP address and be
routed to a different hostile machine
by a compromised router.   This could foil an answer from a secure DNS
These all demand additional authentication and communication that
is durable enough to suffer MITM games as well.
One obvious solution context is corporate communication where both ends are
by a single entity.    The next is trusted neighbors.... Both need  a
"trust but verify"

@_subject: [Cryptography] random numbers on virtual machines? 
Buttons are good especially when they ring clear and unambiguous alarms.
The concurrent discussion about the Rand-Pi illuminates this need.
A better practice might be to export random bits from one or
more devices on the network and blend them together in
a way that you know and hopefully understand.
Virtual machines have difficulty exporting individual hardware resources
to multiple VMs.  The hardware foundations of good RNG devices do not lend
to virtualization  and/or  multiplexing the way network connections do.  So
yes, better solutions should be considered.   Multiplexing the host random
bits can involve a mutual exclusion lock that slows things down.  Owning
the host itself is not an option in many cloud solutions.
Network connection to a port on a set of machines you have some control over
and a process on each that can  read /dev/*rand* and deliver a little or a
lot depending on
the hardware.  Use  good programming practices and perhaps iptables to
limit connections
as well as design the process to throttle connections and share the bits.
You can insert entropy into the local RNG under /dev/*rand* or address your
needs in different ways.
No matter what you elect to do you will promptly find a better way so make
to isolate what you do so the new and better solution is easy to install.
There are network available random numbers that should not be trusted
as a single source.  Mixing three and adding bits of your own can seed
your local PRNG to good effect.  Good enough to invite critical review.
There are three obvious /dev/random /dev/urandom and library functions
like random(), rand() see srand().
See what this returns:
   cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail

Since you are in implementation land code in a way that lets you

of the code base.  Good design here will let you apply tomorrows lessons
The more I read about the BSD decisions on random the more I believe that
initial expectations may become fragile and need to be updated.
The two obvious /dev/random and /dev/urandom involve system
calls which invoke mutex locks all of which takes more time than
interacting with a well seeded user space PRNG.
Assuming flaws an important consideration for an attack is knowing
which flawed resource is involved.    In revision two consider multiple
user space PRNG(s) the selection of which is randomized and feed them
into a mixer using a random weight... 10% from PRNG(a), 60% from PRNG(b)
Any clever idea needs to be subjected to testing... again a design that
isolates these functions facilitates testing to avoid the obvious.  We
all know that double ROT13 is twice as good as single...

Good stuff.
I listened with interest to this issue.
There are some very real issues... but I have yet to hear any good ones on
the media.
Thus I currently believe:
It is a tempest in a teapot...   All federal employees have the option of
multiple email accounts in addition to their assigned federal archived
accounts.  The decision
to use one or the other sits entirely with the employee.
None of these email trust issues explored by Venafi cover federal secrets
Hillary stated that no classified material was transmitted via email...
something which I tend
to agree with.   My limited interaction with classified content taught me
that getting stuff
inside and getting stuff out is brutal and slow.  Digital content can take
forever... Thus
classified material would be paper perhaps handwritten or possibly on a
secured dedicated
device like a laptop or MAC-mini.    Secured in a physical safe in the
home....  Thus encrypted
links while dear to my heart are not an issue here from what little I know.
Given the attack profiles of commercial email services and digging behind
FISA secret warrants
the only way to control and manage any of your mail is to manage your own
mail server.
That is to say that the secret warrant needs to be served on you or someone
on the external wire
connection.   No doubt Hillary and Bill are only a degree or two away from
good and bad,  national leaders...   this eliminates commercial services
like Yahoo, Google,
Microsoft....  The piles of secret warrants would slurp up wedding plans,
yoga workout
hints cookie recipes and more.
The number of emails mentioned is large: sent, received, cc, bcc large
enough that
incoming filters and folders would have made the bucketing of mail
These buckets would make compliance with the request almost easy.  The
large numbers
transferred to the state department also tell me that there was a retention
approaching 100%.     The To: and From: pairs should make omissions almost
easy to
discover from the .gov (united states) side.
Back to large... the message page count "by her count, she had found some
official-business emails covering 55,000 pages" is so large that sorting
through them
for bits of lint to spin and weave into something political challenges my
skeptical mind.

Designing something that is fast because it is amenable to parallel
processing has the
risk of enabling parallel processing attacks for decryption.   If the

So look into the advanced compiler offerings from Intel.
Some of the best optimizations are still done by modern Fortran compilers
so code in FORTRAN, C, C++ and compare and contrast the results.
A number of older compiler manuals can be informative:
The MIPSpro compiler has been reincarnated as the Pathscale compiler and has
much of the same technology.  The -keep flag keeps intermediate temp files
that also have "love notes"
that can often describe why an optimization was impossible.  These can be
used to clarify code
so the compiler can do more.  The AMD compiler is another fork of MIPSpro
from China?
The llvm compiler is giving gcc serious competition.   They are both

Writing compiler systems is a competitive event!
Any benchmark pattern will be gamed.
The notion of safety is ill defined so far in this discussion.
Any advantage that can be discovered will be acted on
 (both by compiler authors and by attackers).
As far as safety is concerned one attack on a secret system is
the timing of actions based on input.   A "safe" system would have
little or no variance but wall time is the most common area of
compiler work.  Performance cannot be ignored simply because
a slow system may be displaced by a quicker protocol that is
less worthy.
The only solutions I know to address this are:
 *) to craft benchmarks of computer languages that test and validate code
that matters.
 *) design a special purpose language, test and benchmark.
 *) eliminate actors that fiddle with the code at all levels.
 *) vigilance
On some systems a runtime link loader or system link loader may inspect code
and because it can see all the moving parts and raid functions in an object
to inline based on cache size and other system knowledge.
Some system objects like init and sh can be fully linked and distributed
with no symbols.  N.B.  Today even the kernel is linked and reloaded as
A fully linked object can still be analyzed by a JIT runtime compiler
Some systems do scan objects for runtime bugs and edit the object
at the time it is loaded into memory.
The VW Diesel CO2/NO  emission gamesmanship are a current example that
proves my point that this is a competitive event.
A partial solution is the one Knuth took with TeX.  He used a subset
of a version of Pascal to craft TeX (tangle, web, weave).   By using a
subset of a language including formatting and optional syntax he simplified
much of his work.
Minimization can be extended to assembly language and calling conventions.
A possibly better solution is to start over and design something like Magic
( where the hardware, compiler, os was as
minimum as a single individual could grock.  While impractical this shows
much of the collection of moving parts in a modern system is extra and
a minimum system could serve as a touchstone.

floating point hardware blocks an array of engines in a GPU that is
inexpensive enough to
embed in firewalls could very much improve  the transparency and reduce the

Increasing the key length does also increase the qubit count of quantum
machines perhaps pushing their availability and usefulness back.
Currently doubling the qubit count is expected to be difficult so tools
that generate
stronger encrypted  data streams that require larger qubit counts can change
the rules quicker than quantum hardware can be developed.
Those with interesting data systems that need to be secure for the next

A sorted dictionary file and some one time preprocessing to speed up
your check should work.  Some data base lookups are quicker than
a hack to speed up.
I am curious... Are you asking for a test to see if your random key
generator fails
by generating lame strings like 987654321?       I half way assume that the
keys you want are keys people might use with the omission of the darn
stupid ones.
Password cracking folk have collected and sorted real passwords and publish
the common ones to use or exclude.
But a random key input would not generate very many lame keys
if it is random, a key consuming block of code should not care.
If you are live testing and want to exclude lame yet expected keys to limit
the exposure of real account breaches filtering against these published
dictionaries is a good idea.
Live testing requires documented permission and clear directions.... there
are still tangles.  CYA.

One important bit is how to structure this in your code.
Even if you have no strategy today the code stub can
return all-OK or randomly trigger a user check.
You do want to carve out an interface that identifies data,
data flow,  security policy and friends even if it is unclear
what to test for at this point in time.
I say this in part because a learning strategy has to remember some
things that might be considered secrets.
The stub may start as a block of code that lists things to do correctly and
that each has been done.
Static answers get optimized by compilers and can vanish but continue
to establish documentation and criteria long after you move on and someone
else is tasked with maintaining the code.  asserts() qualify but if DEBUG
never defined as true they never tell you anything.

   "Simple IoT sensor encryption"
Sensors and or encryption are not simple.
I suspect the important component is simplifying key management.
Facilitating may be the better word.
The next bit is network setup and connectivity including VPNs.
Because sensors are involved: privacy, safety and reliability
all interact into a profile of a threat, use and service model.
Actuators and send-only devices should look identical (IMO) when
sending data.
All devices need an update path.   Time to market demands will ship
devices in a time frame that will demand updates for corrections and feature
completion.  Updates and actuating commands need to operate in
a capability structure set different than simple data.
Thus the most simple or the most complex device will need
the same basic foundations of hardware and software.
The transition to IPv6 needs to be managed.
i.e. DNS and host name lookup will be needs when years
ago one might hard code an IPv4 address set into the device.

to cheat changes.   A linear congruential generator PRNG will repeat after
N but knowing if all possible sets of hands would be presented is a more
question.  Generating each possible hand with equal probability is hard for
a PRNG.
Analysis of PRNGs would have focused on the distribution of bits and bytes.
Sequences that map to possible hands of cards not so much.  In any deck the
set of cards is fixed to 52 unique cards so a lot of bits will get tossed
while filling
in a deck/hand this discarding of bits further reduces the length of the
series before it cycles.  The PRNG might be used to shuffle a deck more
than generate a deck and could result in more efficiency.
The nature of the tourney play is important.   In some tournaments the
cards are presented
in a special bridge board so they can be played by many others.   In
filling the board the cards
can be physically shuffled in ways that limit the ability of a hand to
signal the
possible hands.  i.e. In tournaments the same hand is played on many tables
often at the same tome and player skill is tabulated.  Tell more about how

play is conducted.  A machine that can see one hand can help a lot with bidding if there
is some prior analysis that discovers limits in the  deal.   Bidding and

Does it make sense to look at a strategy that allows a system to boot and
connect with famous cached sites to update the system and then  replace the
keys with unknown entropy with "better keys."   Good bits  should be very
possible once the device (IOT class device) has been up for reasonable
time (define reasonable).
It may be silly to have key generation so early in the boot process.
Better to let the system initialize itself and allow the entropy pool to
fill and  then gate tools that need good keys.   For sure after fsck has
run.  The risky ssh attacks that can begin seconds after a device are real
but the attacks are distributed and the login+password+time is not
under the control of a TLA (today) and could be used as an additional
source of entropy.
Even connection attempts from the internet could trigger the lazy generation
of keys in contrast to building a key early.  Knock, Knock... I hear you
let let me get presentable.   Most real people would not answer the door
pulling on pants...   So a firewall rule,  block,  inspect the log to see
who knocked
and act as needed.
If a design builds a map of a set of bits and lacking a quality TRNG require
bits from here and there be collected mixed and hashed into a larger seed
for use by a PRNG.
i.e. six bits of TRN is not enough but six bits to select, reorder  and
hash local "stuff"
like a DHCP  assigned IPV4 and IPv6 tcp/ip address,  domain name, a hash
of bits from a "random" offset into a  binary system file or three, packet
return or failure
If I time a reboot to a reconnect cycle on a small device the result is
minutes today
so a lot of machine time exists to allow entropy to be collected.
Devices that only make outgoing connections need not keep the "first" key
generated.   A fresh key a day might keep some snooper away.
Local DHCP servers can also deliver local bits to hash and mix.
The DHCP server uptime is likely long enough that quality bits invisible
to TLAs  might be interesting  interesting for enterprises.
Local AES accelerated encryption of local bits mixed into the pile.
All of these:
Initial first boot,
IOT devices,
Portable devices with corporate data.
Portable with encrypted files.
Portable with encrypted filesystems.
Critical servers.
home routers,
local routers,
trunk routers,
Virtual machines (in many rolls).
Mail servers.
Web servers
Data servers
and more will be interacting and _any one_
might be used as the classic side door access
to gain elevate privilege and obtain access to the next.
So if the hardware+system does not deliver a quality TRN of sufficient
size quickly,  a fall through swizzle of local bits and events could
leverage a small set (6+bits perhaps) to build a much better
seed for a more responsive system PRNG.
This is a fundamental system problem as much as an OpenSSL problem.
The system is no stronger than its weakest link.
The small devices are important.

this in the random man page:

     These functions use a cryptographic pseudo-random number generator to
generate high quality random
     bytes very quickly.  One data pool is used for all consumers in a

This is not a domestic issue.  Once demonstrated in this court any court

The only part of this that is crypto is key management.   There no

For the moderator to not shut this down....
How to put a encryption and decryption hat on this discussion.
The order does compel a company to do something they do not want to do and
perceived to be uniquely able to provide.   That takes us to door  and
open the tech behind it.
Now if this was a court order compelling one or more company with vast
computing resources to attack an encrypted data set.
To my knowledge no government has more computing power than
Google+Facebook+Apple+Microsoft  to attack a block of data that
none of the parties generated?
Assuming the list of available data encryption methods enumerated
by NIST as standard encryptions how long can each endure the efforts
of such computing resources if so ordered.
Lets kick it up a notch.   What if a court ordered MS to push a service
into all Windows 10 machines to be part of a distributed computing
resource?  Ordered to do so because they could given their unique position.
Now how long would the same list of standard algorithms fair when such a

At one point it was to about 16.3 installs of Windows 10 a second worldwide.
That identifies a solid number for the rate to install a hack.  As for
machine totals
In Oct 2015  "Microsoft's Terry Myerson, executive vice president of the
Windows and
Devices group, announced that Windows 10 has already been installed on more
than 110 million devices devices since its launch on July 29. The company's
goal is to get Windows 10 running on 1 billion devices with two to three
years, a
number it hopes to hit as partners like HP, Lenovo and Asus bring their own
devices to market."
So if a court can compel a company to build and do something that they are
able to do ... what is next.
For this list there is a technical question... if so ordered what algorithms
and key lengths might be secure when a billion machines are after it
in all their available idle time?
So not the political topic but a technical next move question.

media marketing depends on it.    i.e. the jury of your peers has
been conditioned to accept fantacy on a daily basis.
    More importantly most schools eliminate debate or religate debate or
restrict it to a rarified few
to the point that it is the uncommon teacher that can coach and judge a
quality debate.
The debate lesson learned when two sides of a fabrication have at it and a
declared is eye opening when both are championing a total fabrication.
In the case of Apple and the FBI there is an important line in the WP
"However, there are authors, movie writers, and show producers who tend to
actually believe in their stories rather than suspending disbelief."
My most recent insight I have had in this is that some principals in this
are anchored in a them vs. us contest mindset.
This is insufficient in a global market context.
With global products and global deployments of hardware and software the
exact same
tools apply to both sides.   Our problems are their problems, their
problems are our
This global symmetry and equality for commerce and citizens recolors the
notion of "never say anything" when a flaw, bug or attack is discovered.
The attack that might be held tightly as a nut of power is in reality also
a vulnerability to the same side that thinks of it as power.
Thinking back on Purple and Enigma -- we did not have to discard
our Enigma machines once we discovered a way to read Enigma and
Purple messages.   This was a context where never say anything applied
to methods and capabilities.   For the billions of people on the globe this
is no longer the case because we all use the same subset of possible tools.
Open source, global products, stackexchange, ....
In a global context with the long reach of criminals any exploit is also
a liability and vulnerability to the home front.
Analysis of an individual flaw colors this.   If and only if the vector of
the attack
can be blocked and managed would one say nothing and do nothing.
So on the global Internet "see something, say something".

red+blue ==> Purple.

With a four number PIN there are 9999 keys for the
data on the phone.  All other secrets are constants.
The (AES) key is generated from the PIN (key) entangled with the Unique ID
"Each Secure Enclave is provisioned during fabrication with its own UID
(Unique ID) that is not accessible to other parts of the system and is not
known to Apple. When the device starts up, an ephemeral key is created,
entangled with its UID, and used to encrypt the Secure Enclaveâs portion of
the deviceâs memory space. Additionally, data that is saved to the file
system by the Secure Enclave is encrypted with a key entangled with the UID
and an anti-replay counter."
The net is the device can encrypt data with
a small set of possible keys. Only the PIN is a variable
for a given device.
Can this be used in a lab to reduce the key space for decryption
and expose data on non volatile storage.
Presumably the Flash Memory content has been or will be copied and archived.
It might also be replaced with a "romulator" like flash emulator that can
be quickly
updated when an ten strike or dumb luck erase sequence is hit.
Back to the UID+key+GID bounding things to 9999 keys.
What activity might be applied to the machine to enumerate
and extract or just use the 9999 keys.   The UID and GID are constant
Since: "Every iOS device has a dedicated AES 256 crypto engine built
into the DMA path between the flash storage and main system
memory, making file encryption highly efficient."
Are there "known data" attacks that can leverage the limited 9999 PINs
and the fixed GID (Apple Secret sauce) and unknown but also fixed UID
to find out which of the 9999 PINs was used to secure the phone.
Presumably the hardware only has to be instructed to read data (DMA)
into RAM with 9999  user space entered keys for an exhaustive brute force
The bulk of the AES key is fixed in the device and reading flash is quicker
than write.
What happens on a healthy phone when the PIN is changed and how fast can

My point is that this one individual device (singular) has a limited set of
that it will employ to encrypt any data.
Given a binary dump of an encrypted phone with no additional
information it is a problem of more keys than the atoms in the
universe. Not the case for an individual phone however.
The atoms of the universe does not apply if you are Apple.
A large part of the key space is fixed by the fixed Apple
device secrets.   Apple has no record of the device internal ID and
no knowledge of the PIN but their secret does limit the key space
used in all phones of the same type.
The limited set of keys is generated from three things: the device unique
Apple's secret key same on all like phones and the user controlled  PIN.
Once the binary contents of the encrypted file system are pulled
from the flash device.  Should the device be connected to a computer
or phone network it will reset, reboot reload and operate with the same
internal secrets it has always had.
Setting the four number PIN  will start encrypting the phone in one of the
possible ways that this one phone can use in this mode.
Is there any component of the encrypted data that can validate
or dismiss the key and move on to the next?
Simple tricks might change the 10000 to many many more with
a little effort at boot time.

This is interesting:
   "If the cracking is done on the devise itself, it
    would take 5Â½ year for a 6 character lowercase/digit password."
And obviously if the pass key was a 4 number PIN the time could be less.

into a constant known to the hardware.

Here is Google's Translation.
Government position Encryption
We hereby send you the government's position to about encryption. It
responds to the commitments made during the AO Telecom Council of June
10, 2015 (TK 2014-2015, 21501-33, no. 552) and AO JHA Council on
October 7th, 2015.
Encryption, also known as encryption, it is easy to obtain, and
increasingly to use, and thus makes more and more a part of the
regular data traffic. By the government, businesses and citizens are
increasingly used encryption to protect the confidentiality and
integrity of their communications and stored data. This is important
for the confidence of people in digital products and services and for
the Dutch economy in light of the rapidly evolving digital society. At
the same encryption is a barrier to obtaining information necessary
for investigation, intelligence and security services when attackers
(including criminals and terrorists) being involved. The recent
attacks in Paris, where possible use is made of encryption of the
communication by the terrorists, leading to the justified question
what is needed for investigation, intelligence and security services
to provide good visibility and allow keep on attack planning.
To the duality described in the previous paragraph was also heard in
the public debate in recent months about the dilemmas € ™ s around the
use of encryption. Also, the House has spoken on this subject. During
the AO Telecom Council was asked what will the government do to
stimulate strong encryption. In addition, from the House of
Representatives asked to come up with a cabinet position around
After that discusses the importance of encryption for the system and
information from the government and companies, and for the
constitutional protection of privacy and the confidentiality of
communications. In addition, the importance of detection of serious
crime and protect national security outlined. Finally came after
weighing the interests to a conclusion.
The Dutch situation can hereby not be seen in isolation from the
international context. Strong encryption software is available
worldwide increasingly or already integrated in products or services.
Given the wide availability and use of advanced encryption techniques
and the transnational nature of the data traffic the prospects for
action at national level is limited.
Importance of encryption for the government, businesses and citizens
Cryptography is a key technical security in the digital domain. Many
cyber security measures in organizations rely heavily on the use of
encryption. The secure storage of passwords, to protect against loss
or theft of laptops and secure storage of backups have been difficult
without the use of encryption. The protection of data transmitted over
the internet, internet banking for example, is only possible by using
encryption. Because of the interconnectedness of systems worldwide
ramifications and different routes that can make communication, the
risk of interception, breach, inspection or modification of
information and communication always present.
The government increasingly digitally communicates with citizens and
providing services involving sensitive data, such as the use of DigiD
or doing tax returns. As stated in the coalition agreement must be
able to fully digital control their public affairs from 2017 citizens
and businesses. The government will have a duty to ensure that these
data are protected against perusal by third parties; Encryption
management is vital. The protection of communication within the
government is dependent on encryption as the security of diplomatic
communications and military communications.
For companies, encryption is essential to keep business information
safe and send. The use of encryption strengthens the international
competitiveness of the Netherlands and contributes to an attractive
business and innovation environment to include startups, data centers
and cloud computing. Confidence in secure communication and data
storage is essential for the (future) growth potential of the Dutch
economy, which is mainly in the digital economy.
Encryption supports the respect of privacy and the confidentiality of
communications with citizens because it provides them a means to
protect the confidentiality and integrity of personal data and
communications. This is also important for the exercise of freedom of
expression. Example, it enables citizens but also professionals with
an important democratic function as journalists, be able to
communicate confidentially.
Encryption therefore proposes all concerned to ensure the
confidentiality and integrity of communications and to protect
themselves better against eg espionage and cyber crime. These are
fundamental rights and freedoms, security and economic interests stand
to benefit.
Encryption and opsporingsâ € "intelligence and security
The competences and resources that the services at their disposal,
must be equipped on the current and future digital reality. With
effective, legitimate access to data encourage investigation,
intelligence and security, the security of the digital and the
physical world. Encryption is where it is used by malicious hinder the
investigation, intelligence and security in accessing that data. For
example, they experience these obstacles when doing research on the
distribution and storage of child pornography, in support of military
missions abroad, countering cyber attacks or when they want to gain
visibility and keep on planning of attacks by terrorists. Criminals,
terrorists and opponents in armed conflict are often aware that they
at some point the attention of the authorities to take and now also
have access to sophisticated encryption methods to avoid difficult or
break. The use of such methods requires little technical knowledge, as
encryption is often an integral part of the Internet services of which
they can also make use of. This makes it difficult, slow, or makes it
impossible (in time) to gain insight into the communication for the
purpose of safeguarding national security and the investigation of
criminal offenses. The research may also hearing and the evidence for
a conviction to be impeded.
The right to respect for privacy and the confidentiality of
communications with citizens
Applying encryption to help citizens as noted earlier, in securing the
privacy and confidentiality of their communications. The
above-mentioned legitimate access to data and communications through
investigation, intelligence and security services constitutes an
infringement of the confidential communications of citizens.
Confidentiality of communication affects the constitutionally
regulated respect for privacy and the right to protection of privacy
of correspondence, telephone and telegraph (hereinafter â € ~It
communicatiegeheimâ € ™). These rights are enshrined respectively in
Article 10 and Article 13 of the Constitution. In addition, these
fundamental rights enshrined in Article 8 ECHR and Articles 7 and 8 EU
Charter (as far as EU law is hit).
The protection of fundamental rights is applicable to the digital
world. The aforementioned grondrechtelijke- and provisions of
international law together provide the framework to counter illegal
infringements. The rights are not absolute, which means that
restrictions are permitted provided they meet the requirements of the
Constitution and the ECHR (and as far as EU law is concerned, the EU
Charter) set. An infringement is permissible if it serves a legitimate
purpose, is regulated by law and the limitation is foreseeable and
known. In addition to the restriction must be necessary in a
democratic society. Finally, it should be proportional to the
infringement, ie the government objective must be proportionate in
relation to the infringement of privacy and / or confidentiality of
These requirements provide the framework within which the decision can
be made between the interests at stake in encryption, such as the
right to privacy and the confidentiality of communications, public and
national security and preventing criminal offenses. Preceding
assessment framework is to the extent that the special powers of the
intelligence and security concerns, moreover, enshrined in the Law on
Intelligence and Security 2002 (Articles 18 and 31 of the Wiv 2002).
The cooperation obligations decryption included in the Wiv (Articles
24, paragraph and 25, the seventh member of the ISS Act 2002) and the
CCP (Article 126m, sixth paragraph, of the CCP) can be invoked if the
associated special powers are exercised after a consideration in the
above sense.
Balancing and Conclusion
Breaking the encryption is present in fewer cases. Additionally, the
ability to recover data in unencrypted form to a service provider,
less often available. Increasingly, in modern applications of
encryption, the data still in an encrypted form only processed by
service providers. Given the importance of the investigation and
prosecution of criminal offenses and the interests involved in
national security, require these developments to look for new
At present, there is no insight into ways in general, for example
through standards, weaken encryption products without thereby the
safety of digital systems that use encryption to compromise. For
example, by introducing a technical input into an encryption product
that can be seen for the prosecution authorities would allow encrypted
files in digital systems can be vulnerable to eg criminals, terrorists
and foreign intelligence services. This could have undesirable
consequences for the security of information communicated and stored,
and the integrity of ICT systems, which are increasingly of importance
for the functioning of the society.
In carrying out their statutory duties are the investigation,
intelligence and security services depends in part on collaboration
with suppliers of ICT products and services. Given this dependence,
requires consultation with service providers on effective provision of
data to use their services by malicious, respecting everyone's role
and responsibilities and legal frameworks.
Given the above considerations, we arrive at the following conclusion:
The government's role is to ensure the safety of the Netherlands and
the offenses to detect. The Cabinet stressed the need for legitimate
access to data and communications. In addition, governments,
businesses and citizens benefit from maximum security of the digital
systems. The government recognizes the importance of strong encryption
for Internet security, to support the protection of the privacy of
citizens, for confidential communication of the government and
companies, and for the Dutch economy.
Therefore, the government believes that it is currently not
appropriate to adopt restrictive legal measures against the
development, availability and use of encryption within the
Netherlands. In the international context, the Netherlands will this
conclusion and the considerations upon which propagate based.
Regarding encouraging strong encryption will give the Minister of
Economic Affairs to follow the intent of the amendment (TK 2015-2016,
34 300 XIII, 10) on the budget of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

Good info.
The xflitration of stuff that cannot be validate is a show stopper.
It allows a big outbound side channel that cannot be audited.
The side channel is as large as the data channel and could xflitrate
the data as a copy XORed with a key/pad known to a turned insider and
an external snooper.
Pseudo random is troubling in the context that it is knowable if
the state can be guessed which today is likely because the seed
size limits the set of streams not the period length.
Swap out the pseudo random data and insert a second set of encrypted  data
multiplexed by a PRN and a previously shared seed+N   that swizzles
bytes in words or longer might allow multiple encrypted messages to move in
with improved security.   Each message encrypted with its own key might
have value
on long haul links multiplexed by a long period PRN or addional keyed
The multiplex decode could be a large encrypted block of PRN  that must be
decrypted with a third key.
A multiplexed stream set could complicate analysis of N messages each
with their own encryption.  And not waste data bandwidth excessively.

This is a real issue but if we ignore the constitutional issues
a secret disclosure to the government for their comfort that
the system they run is what they think it is.  Or to discover flaws
that can be used offensively is different than the Apple issue.
The public nature of the Apple demand places apple in the
law enforcement service business.  It would do so in such
a way that the service could be demanded by anyone.
There is a line that says additional legal warrants  but there is
no prohibition for this service outside of a US legal warrant.
The constitutional issue is that the net we are seeing cast

Summer and International... golly...
You just excluded the north or southern hemisphere  ;-)
For me the take away is that there is no system for email
that is sufficiently secure today that is user friendly
and  accessible from common tools like a phone, notebook,
chromebook or common desktop/side computer.
A critical path problem for archives is that the archive is also a treasure
and the messages must be readable by many which argues with cryptography.
It is technically easy for two of us to exchange messages with
strong encryption but adding more recipients becomes a tangle.
Audit and archive is the third and fourth reader that breaks things.
The archival requirement for mail in this case appears to mandate
that the message store/archive be in the clear or locked with
an archive key.   The key management over time seems difficult.
Anyone that communicates with a famous person securely
will need a dedicated key pair for that person to deliver on a legal
request.  Famous  can reach back in time so I need to have a
public/private key pair for each of  1000+ individuals in my contact
list and also their public key used to communicate with me.
Or the valid legal request for a key for all messages to a named individual
would unlock all messages to the 999+ unnamed individuals.
Transport security to and from a trusted device and a server seems
possible.   Printing and screen capture from a remote device is
a real problem.   Again a central server would have to manage
all the keys over time.  The managing team of that central server
could have a Snowden so the larger the server the larger the treasure trove.
To me there are mixed agenda.   Some like the media want access
via a freedom of information request or full transparency.   This requires
that a broker
be in a position to inspect, classify, redact, reclassify or deny
of the document.    Others wish to audit security... and track
all communications to detect disclosure real-time and in history.
Meta data -- yes that is also critical.
One bit of meta data is not an issue but the entire flow of meta data
would have a high classification as the deception of "Operation Fortitude"
of WW2 demonstrated.

A thought -- there are only two parts.
The message and a function that generates a table of bits while
operating on the message.
The function to be of value in cryptography needs
to be near impossible to predict and sufficiently
random that the message is not exposed to other attacks.
The internet today has lots of identical hardware running the
same software so a solution that works for two individuals
must also scale to billions.
Analysis needs data and billions of systems generates masses
of data to inspect and explore.    A couple of individuals communicating
do not generate much data so the analysis of their black box method is
For two individuals to take a couple common random tools
and mix the results a little or a lot would make them harder
to attack.   For the billions of systems to do this exact same thing
generates masses of data for inspection and analysis.
The analysis that an adversary might employ can be costly.
To look at two individuals is expensive while big bulk samples
may cost the same.   Their value equation is the pot of gold

As Ard said the issue is the size of cache and cache lines.
His explanation is excellent..
The correct and optimum method differs for each size core.
Code that is correct for both is not optimum for both.
The instruction set allows the OS to move "code" from one to
the other and back in the manner of SMP.   However at the device  level,
cases like this discussion, getting it correct is important.  i.e. not
symmetric (equal).
In the SOC world such things are further complicated by functional blocks

@_subject: [Cryptography]  Recommendations for short AES passphrases 
Any comments or helpful suggestions would be appreciated
Much depends on the network and physical security of your systems.
A short pass phrase that unlocks a longer key makes sense if and only if
the saved private key file is difficult to get too.
If the private but locked key is stolen the attacker then has time and
to unlock it.
With all important keys you must be able to remember them
or that which is locked is lost.
Perhaps, If your only incoming and outgoing connection is ssh to a terminal
shell on another machine  then a shortish pass phrase makes some sense.
A phrase of common words confused with some easy to apply random additions
might prove durable enough for personal use.
A company like Google might guide their staff to write long keys down
and lock them in a physical vault bolted to the floor.  Other key management
methods may apply.
So as others noted"   What threat are you defending against?"
The good news is the short key can be improved and changed.
Short keys are a defense against the forgetful.

Not hopeless,
The problem is large yet calling convention for the  ABI of existing

GCC and CLANG use a common calling convention.
If the problem boils down to an ABI problem that can also be addressed.
We already have a mix of 32 and 64 bit objects on most systems.  With
good cause adding one or more with today's system memory resources
could be negotiated.
Those that use MPI (written in C) commonly use FORTRAN
for their working code.   Fortran well because the compiler
can optimize a lot of things safely.   The Message Passing Interface code
and process control is written mostly in C.   Not just fortran but Python
bindings and more exist.
So to start, code modules of interest in a "better" language
and use a common ABI link to the larger body of system code and libraries.
Over time one layer at a time replace the dependencies.
At thes end point C is left behind and the "better" tool chain
is responsible for the entire program.
It may take a couple starts to learn what a "better" language
and tool chain is.    Often the objections and advantages
are best understood when used for real so start.

It does not require tampering with a programming language

It focuses on a single thing and uses existing
programming languages.   One code base can be slow if that is
what happens but as a pair they could cause the

It has additional merit in that equal functionality

large amount of representative text. With the availability of modern

easily made. Examples can be drawn from a variety of sources (press

are differences especially for general fiction with the position of 'h' and

   ....See below for full abstract....
Browser based interfaces are getting common enough that understanding the
details of this limited
case has value.  One is understand what and how to constrain the feature
set of browsers.
There are sites and users that work exclusively in a single application and
they are easy to attack this way.
The application is loaded and the user logs in and out of the application
not the system.
Should an attacker know a lot about a specific application (insider) and
the site itself an agent could do stuff to steal credentials.   Some
have credential based privileges and a user at a low level could leave a
imposter screen in an attempt to grab the password of a higher level.
A frustrated user attempting to log in might hit reset or never blink twice
at a blue
screen of death.  A binary could do more ...
Abstract. I researched the ability of browsers to counterfeit the behaviour
of installed software. In full screen mode browsers can counterfeit almost
anything, including BSOD, formatting the hard drive and fake login screens.
I found one category of behaviour which could not be counterfeited by a
remote website. On examination every solution in that category was a secret
known by the computer user and her browser. That is, remote websites cannot
counterfeit what they do not know. Neither Bob nor Mallory know secrets
shared between the computer user and her computer. This transformed game
theory research into cryptography research. On successful verification of a
TLS certificate’s digital signature the browser should present the
’user-browser’ shared secret together with the TLS certificate’s identity
credentials. This allows the user to authenticate both her browser and the
identity specified in the TLS certificate. Following these conclusions, an
authentication mechanism for manufactured goods is presented.

This use of something in unintended ways is interesting.
In the context of GIT we are talking about a massive distributed
filesystem and SHA-1 based file system metadata.
Filesystems need to store data reliability and also be resilient to
disruptions and more.
A GIT system or a distributed and mirrored tree of package distributions

recover when
an error is discovered.
It is not turtles all the way down.  Some layers have risks.   IIRC FCOE

This tells me that the replacement of SHA-1 in GIT also needs to
address all the  issues of a file system this large.  A malicious SHA-1
collision is just part of the system that needs attention.
Error detection and correction ECC needs to be end to end.
Redundancy and mirroring need attention.
Recovery should be reliable and nearly transparent.

other systems.  Encryption, security and audit needs should not be blocked

This is oldish news (tracking dots) and without the physical document in
hand I believe the official
story.   The leaked document had been imaged, scanned or iPhotograpged by
the news reporter as proof and it was obvious that a physical vs digital
leak was involved.   The audit then focused on print logs and. found about
six records for printing.  Then the six were checked and only one had been
in contact with this news outlet.
I should have played with my scanner and cameras to se if the yellow dots
are reliably reproduced.
My guess is they are not but imaging has improved.  The published images
would be screen optimized and single stink jet spots would be lost IMO.
If the physical document is recovered then the yellow anti counterfeiting
dots come to play as designed for counterfeit investigations.   There may
be more tracking games to watermark an original but the yellow dots are not
content specific.   Specific knowledge allows falseification or obfuscation
of the yellow dots.
Media outlets need to up their game to protect sources.  Sources now have
greater and increasing risk both through audit and stenography as well as
versioning hooks digital and physical.

The uncrackable is difficult.
A single cell phone is difficult.   However two devices could be less hackable.
An old cell phone can be side loaded with an application in developer mode
and kept in airplane mode and air gaped.
Old device, enter text, encrypt and generate a QR code block.
A second phone can see the QR code block, cross the air gap
with the camera., convert to  characters and transmit.  Reception
of an encrypted  message uses a generated QR code that the receivers old
cell phone can see with its camera crossing the air gap to be decrypted.
Key management can be facilitated with paper QR code sheets.
A sheet of QR codes can be printed with a layout kin to
a phone key pad and by selecting four or more (N) based
on a pin known only to the sender the secret reloaded.
No encryption key is intact on a single QR block.   Something physical and
also something known.
Permutations of hardware allow keyboard and screen of a laptop to replace the
old phone  QR code generation and also shared and private secret management.
Airplane mode allows an air gap, QR blocks facilitate data entry
across an air gap.
Both Google and Microsoft use web displayed QR blocks to
interact with their multi factor authentication tools.
The number of characters is large enough to be interesting.
Newer devices are improving in some ways but mixing old and new complicates
hacking and lower cost.
The messages in transit need not be generated with air gaped
safety and complexity to allow a larger market and user community.
Simple copy and paste can replace the QR code air gap step.

This link shows how easy this is to do:
I would note that that QR codes can be used for the input of complex encryption
codes by multiple individuals and be a site useful strategy for key management.
I can visualize a manager and two engineers in a room where the manager can see
that both the physical and digital QR keys for the system are  used.
The manager has a key and the engineer has a key so three or four
padlock keys are needed
in routine use.   Key recovery is enabled by the ability to cut the
four locks or crack the safe

can have alarms
and remote monitoring.
Complex keys can be transported on paper by multiple individuals to
remote sites or as images
or as known URLs or...  Complex codes can be transported from air
gaped TNG generation supported
systems to production systems that are air gaped or not.
QR codes have simple error detection and multiple modes.  Some use
modes I was unaware of

in the database and from the discussion I can see a multitude of
options to improve
system security.
One element is 'access' method(s).   This hangs on the last password change
and will become the current best method after a change.
Slightly risky is a login process that has the password, validates on
the old method
and then updates the system with the old password using the new method.
Thus the system needs to know both the old and new methods and data.
This conversion is transparent to the customer.   Short and foolish passwords
can be flagged for attention or mandated action.
Multiple access methods seem necessary, two factor with SMS for example.
N.B. the chaos the Social Security Admin triggered by 'requiring' a method
that involved a device (SMS phone) that their customers might have.

A recent Stanford EE380 talk.
Stanford Seminar: Beyond Floating Point: Next Generation Computer Arithmetic.
Published on Feb 2, 2017
EE380: Computer Systems Colloquium Seminar
Beyond Floating Point: Next-Generation Computer Arithmetic
Speaker: John L. Gustafson, National University of Singapore
A new data type called a "posit" is designed for direct drop-in
replacement for IEEE Standard 754 floats. Unlike unum arithmetic,
posits do not require interval-type mathematics or variable size
operands, and they round if an answer is inexact, much the way floats
do. However, they provide compelling advantages over floats, including
simpler hardware implementation that scales from as few as two-bit
operands to thousands of bits. For any bit width, they have a larger
dynamic range, higher accuracy, better closure under arithmetic
operations, and simpler exception-handling. For example, posits never
overflow to infinity or underflow to zero, and there is no
"Not-a-Number" (NaN) value. Posits should take up less space to
implement in silicon than an IEEE float of the same size. With fewer
gate delays per operation as well as lower silicon footprint, the
posit operations per second (POPS) supported by a chip can be
significantly higher than the FLOPs using similar hardware resources.
GPU accelerators, in particular, could do more arithmetic per watt and
per dollar yet deliver superior answer quality.
A series of comprehensive benchmarks compares how many decimals of
accuracy can be produced for a set number of bits-per-value, using
various number formats. Low-precision posits provide a better solution
than "approximate computing" methods that try to tolerate decreases in
answer quality. High-precision posits provide better answers (more
correct decimals) than floats of the same size, suggesting that in
some cases, a 32-bit posit may do a better job than a 64-bit float. In
other words, posits beat floats at their own game.

And since data has value the system needs to ponder death and taxes.
As a minimum a contractual obligation to notify the disclosure inside

any delivery of the key if so mandated by law needs to be part of any EULA.
As a result the warrant must void the contract that is a foundation of the

Fork also duplicates a number of things not just data (copy on write)
but also file descriptors, UID, GUD, effective  UID and GID, atributes for
SeLinux and more state.
A privileged process needs to reliably shed some data and privledge to not
leak information.
A single binary can contain code to do a multitude of things. Some  that
should not happen in the same binary or process.
A named pipe or shared memory buffer could be used by a generator in a
forked-child to feed
data to the parent or yet another process.  I.e. a child might interact
with dev/random and a PRNG but keep the random seed hidden from the parent.
  Each child would wake to find a clean slate
and not see any 'secrets' that were marked to be wiped but could cooperate
in a multi process problem.
Example to ponder:  BusyBox: The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux does a
lot of stuff
in one binary and one acts like a shell.   Any of its child processes could
be a fork()
or fork(); exec() pair of itself with another entry point. Commonly built
and fully linked to not depend on shared objects there are lots of eggs
(tools) in one basket.
Wipe on fork seems necessary but may not solve all problems.  In crypto a
Swiss Army knife binary an advantage could be a single file atomic update
that is “easy to update” but would contain tools to operate, on keys,
input, output, generate keys, etc...  perhaps too many things.
SSD files that are ephemeral could be unlinked and encrypted with a one
time dev/random pad generated and optionally expanded perhaps with a PRNG
so any part of the pad can be regenerated using a use once true random seed
set and XOR to obscure bits on SSD components or even hidden blocks on

A lot depends on 'Software' in this context.
Too often the OS and software are joined at the hip.
For an operating system and all the applications in it this is a problem
that is bigger than a breadbox.
What your are asking for is broad atomic update of a versioning filesystem.
Stage 10,000 files and commit with an audit trail that can be reversed on an
OS that itself can depend on the files.
In linux one boot process begins with a boot loader that copies a bootstrap
operating system filesystem image into memory and starts the OS.   The OS
runs out of RamDisk to check the physical disks then mounts them and
to the OS on disk or even NFS This pivot and the continuation takes more
than a millisecond.
Specific applications are simpler:
Some Linux applications run out of a change root where files are copied or
hard linked then chroot is invoked for the application (old or new but not
both right) which
then finds all the tools it needs and no more (hopefully).
A fresh chroot could be built and the original chroot process shutdown and
the new
one started almost quickly but the shutdown and restart would not be all
that quick
depending on the data.
A real problem is long running processes, shared libraries and open files.
Shared libraries in a system
are intended to apply to the entire system with minimum versioning.   A
running process has
many files open.   An editor on a handy machine 'vim' has 22 open files and
three devices (pty for stdin/out/err).
The 17 library fines (shared objects) that must be updated together (as
needed) with a new
version of the editor.
I recall a talk by White on Smalltalk where the Smalltalk system
interpreter could pick up
an edit to the editor source as quick as it hit the disk while still in the
editor.   If he made
an error the editor might be too broken to recover..
If you get the filesystem correct you have a versioning filesystem so tools
need to accept a version
flag or live with the current.
The system that lives on a versioning filesystem would need to be modified
to cope for interrupt free
Versioning in languages like 'go' need not depend on system shared
Eliminating shared libraries does simplify some entangling dependencies
at the expense of disk space and RAM.
Make and makedepend might need to be enhanced and baked into the OS.
GenToo does some of this now but milliseconds and going back -- not this
Trix  (SGI's Trusted Irix) had mandatory access AMC features and MLD (multi
level directories and binaries)
where manipulation of labels for users, dirs, files an application could
only see files at the
same level or lower.  SELinux, WindowsNT and Win10 have some of these
strong mandatory access
tools.  And policy changes if made sufficiently atomic could be used to
flip a switch.
See the attribute structures in XFS (SGI's now open source filesystem)

Rather than using shared libraries, I would like to see the use of
Shared libraries in addition to saving RAM and disk space also
distribute maintenance.  A consumer of a library “should” need to
know no more than the API of the function and methods being used.
Once things get stripped down and only contain the exact set of functions
used the author quickly is responsible for evaluating all changes and
the application.  That is difficult enough that many will rebuild if the
gets touched.
In *nix  there is a key set of programs that are fully linked to .a files
and are fully self contained but the full library is linked not the subset
of the library.
The go language and compiler offer some help.  The incremental compile and
builds on previous compiled bits and builds fresh the necessary when
foundation code changes.
It still uses system shared libraries but those could be rewritten in go so
the environment
extends to the systemcall API&ABI.
This does not solve interpreted language issues like shell, awk, bash,
Perl, python, php, ruby...
Also prelink tools and steps need to be addressed.  The runtime linking
needs help to sort
the  address space link hints. A defensive trick to randomize link
addresses also needs review.
Encryption tricks might help to validate each object before loading.
Dwarf/elf/coff execution format files rich in link and debug info could
also contain signatures and check sums.   Debugging and debuggers mess
with security.
With a 64  bit address space a single library file (memory mapped) could be
built that  has
a single address lookup table.   i.e.  A grandlib.so file could be
assembled and
updated with a single inode pair (old, new) and simplify the atomic file
Such a grandlib resource does need assurance.  It might need to be
not unlike an encrypted file system and mounted only for a validated binary.
Backing off from the full Win/Linux system problem the tiny (giggle) IOT
devices do present
a more limited universe for these problems.  As small as they appear the
issues are large.

A google tech talk on YouTube.
"...Google TechTalk, 8/28/17, presented by Alessandro Chiesa Abstract: In
Bitcoin, a payment's details are broadcast in the clear, so that anyone can
verify its validity. Unfortunately, this violates user privacy and
sacrifices coin fungibility. I will describe the Zerocash protocol, which
uses zero knowledge proofs to achieve privacy-preserving payments in a
Bitcoin-like system. This protocol was recently deployed in the wild, as
part of the cryptocurrency Zcash. "About the Speaker: Alessandro Chiesa is
an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science at UC Berkeley. His research spans the areas of complexity
theory, cryptography, and security, and focuses on the theoretical
foundations and practical implementations of cryptographic proof systems
such as zero knowledge proofs. He is a co-inventor of Zerocash and
co-founder of Zcash. He is an author of libsnark, the leading open-source
library for succinct zero knowledge proofs. He has received a Ph.D. in
computer science from MIT in 2014, and B.S. degrees in computer science and
in mathematics from MIT in 2009."

Law can specify that the merchant ID never be stored except for a hash

would be a pair, think of the Merchant and Customer bits as salt plus

The bound hash if lost only has repercussions at exactly one merchant.

One of the lessons of the Morris worm smacked a lot of responsible
Unix developers
up along side the head and embarrassed the heck out of them.
Embarrassment does
not seem to be getting the attention of IoT device vendors and the
hardware is too inexpensive
for the CEO or chancellor of the university to  write a memo and read
the riot act on the
manager of these shared resources.
What I take from this is there needs to be some leverage to require
IoT device vendors
to act on security bug reports made to responsible agencies.
Embarrassment is not enough.
Devices less than some value too inexpensive to maintain need to open
or escrow their software
and maintain an update service for at least a decade.
Legal framework...
National services like the DHS should mirror updates and minimize the
risk of traffic generating
download sites that also piggyback malware/adware and cruftware.
National agencies might
constrain themselves to a File verification service where a strong
check sum like  SHA-2, SHA-3 or ____
can be matched to a download object.
i.e. enter "a7e8a03b8b0313744c382d010405282a"
and the service returns "md5sum of PasswdSafe-chrome-6.10.0.zip from
SourceForge Apr 21, 2018".
The details are open to review but it is a risk to download a package
from a site and also trust
the verification sum from the same site.
The services being "light weight" allow a modest amount of dedicated
hardware.   The likes of Google, Apple,
Amazon, Microsoft,  Netgear, etc need not serve bits for the
competition just ID a package.  The content is almost static
and might run on a read only resource.
Entering something like: "bc03fd52652420a1e29192671909d489" should
return "Unknown".
In the case of packages with known problems the service should return
"Obsolete-has-fixed-bugs", etc.
Registering an update service with multiple validation services might
notice problems quickly enough to
minimize risks.   Kaspersky does notice that packages are old but then
offers to update them which is
an improvement for some but a risk at another level.

Your question is a good one.
Part of the answer is in your question:   "I don't know enough to even

Another is that it looks easy if you know the answer (have the key)  but as

make you famous because they are difficult.
Open a calculus text book to find famous theorem after theorem (discovery)
that once mastered allows problems to be solved.

a beach.   I paced the location so I can find it again.
If you know the X+Y coordinates you have a chance.  If my pace length is
unique you might never find it.   Is the location Polar
or Cartesian.  Is it Y,X or X,Y  Is the angle of the grid clock and date
based... what system did I use?
Fast forward to modern tools, if I take a file and cutters to the gold coin
so I have a lot of bits then scatter them in the sand in a systematic way I
be able to recover the date of the coin and name the face on the coin in
the future.    Lacking that system the message on the coin is almost
impossible to recover from the sand.   Gold easy because it is heavy and
might be recovered with a gold pan but to
get the entire coin someone would have to inspect a lot of sand with a gold
pan. The entire beach is a lot of sand.
The encryption space for these modern methods is larger than the count of
all the grains of sand in all the beaches.

It seems to lack enough science to be well anchored.
As a framework for decision makers ... it is lacking clarity of the
possible and impossible
at a technical level.
Some of the difficult technical parts are dismissed as being easy and
They are not.
The dependency tree is lacking.   i.e. A secure phone is necessary for
commerce and banking via
a portable device (common).   A universal side door master code breach
defeating the security of the entire
product line of a phone  could drain the accounts of all phone carrying
citizens.  An generic all writs attack on
Apple security is now also a defacto attack on the phone Trump owns.  If
that attack is successful and escapes then that
phone could be hacked and listened to.
The use of the language "lawful hacking" page 52 seems to ignore the
reality that most federal hacking today
is supported a little or a lot technically by the purchase of "illegal
hacking" tools on the dark web.  These tools are
sometimes purchased on international markets.  These purchases and their
use may be illegal in such a context
when not used in national defense i.e. developing bug fixes.  There is
likely an Oliver North style connection involving
asset forfeiture or hacked and stolen cash and international trade in these
criminal tools especially if the seller has a
soviet or chinese government connection.  If so, I am sure it is
cryptographically well protected ;-).
International... law and the reach of US law is ignored.   A foreign made
phone (Samsung or Chinese) would
be required to embed US secret keys and software.   Delivering those keys
places  "US secret keys"
in the hands of foreign nationals.  There is no technical goal outlined
that enables any nation to have an
equal decryption privilege equal to that of the US demands for
It shares the observation that surveillance has gone dark.  That  implies
that there was a LOT
of listening going on at the point secure commerce (bank, iTunes, iPay,
i.e. money) became common and the
cell phone infrastructure was locked down using encryption standards
established by the feds for commerce.
Apple has sold more than one billion iPhones worldwide from 2007 to 2017
which is a rich gold mine
even if 10% tie their banking and credit to their phone.   The billion
phones if only a couple dollars was
stolen from each is many billions and perhaps trillions globally.
There is a nice discussion on complexity and bug fixes. Adding side doors
if even possible risks complexity
and thus errors.   Key management is discussed but not in a way that is a
solution for law enforcement

For hardware the Ben Franklin analysis might come to play.
Hardware can kill all the bits that hold speculative information.
Alternatively they need never be alive.
    "Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead."  << == killing
hardware registers is possible.
The race condition eliminated and timing of the logic sorted the Ben F.
solution can apply
Already logic blocks allow out of order execution but the result is not
until it is time.   These extra result registers allow hyper-threading.
The first problem is what to do now.  I suspect the goal is to slam the
door on the risk.
Intel will be happy to make AMD collateral damage in the short term.  The
urgency of the Intel
mess cleanup will dominate and so far the Intel driven solutions do not
seem to break AMD
just slow both down.
A second is to address the reality that there are decades of hardware to
make safe (enough).
Decades of hardware is not going away.   A personal machine running known
software is not
a worry where the owner of the machine has administrative rights and sudo
The big risk is all the hardware that makes the cloud easy to manage and
make the cloud possible.
Once the door is slammed on this some sanity will prevail.
I fear that this attack set will spawn more attack research and more chinks
will be found.
The crypto risk is that data systems all depend on credentials and should
these leak
all manner of problems follow.
A third landmark goal is to design hardware that does not take the 5-35%
perf hit.  Whoever solves this
first will sell a lot of hardware including motherboard and DRAM makers.

The code could be limited and 'safer' by design using methods like seL4 and

The compilers at SGI were decent... and the engineers looked
hard at the VLIW world and found it brutal.  The Itanium was
VLIW and used in an SGI machine.  There was also a project at
Transmeta.   The Itanium hardware was slower than expected  and buggy.
The compiler software framework changes to address optimization
for classic and VLIW machines and more was not well received  then in
the open source world.  The entire SGI framework was later put out
as open source and can be found by looking for PATHSCALE EKO COMPILER SUITE™
and also looking on the AMD site.  EKO is a bit arrogant "Every Known
but as optimizing compilers go it is a good one and has pulled gcc, LLVM -
Intel,  Green Hills and other compilers forward a lot.
The AMD compilers vs Intel compiler games are interesting some will recall
"Intel's compiler doesn't have specific "scheduling" modes for AMD, VIA or
Cyrix CPUs
(remember them?), only for Intel products. The CPUID instruction
(introduced in the Pentium)
fills several registers with information about the CPU's make, model name
and capabilities."  <-- reddit Feb 2016
The interesting bit is scheduling modes....
The internals of many processors today are RISC with a microcode
plus hardwired instruction translation from x86* to internal RISC.
The internal RISC and the associated microcode updates are involved
in the current  mitigation efforts.   Early performance measures are showing
better results than might be expected from historic ABI/API  space and
might be microcode assisted.
A risk with microcode updates is that a sufficiently clever intruder
could roll back or modify micro code to reopen or open new bugs.
I never looked at how microcode gets pushed into the part so
hacking it could be easy or hard.
Microsoft is pushing updates very aggressively on Windows10.
That might make it harder for hackers to develop and test
hacks on Win10 ;-)   even if the common Win10 user could care
less about side channel hacks inside his home behind a firewall.
So....  I've been thinking, and that's one of my thoughts.
You might be on the right path.   VLIW can have deep pipelines
and pipelining + optimization poked at with hand coded ASM seems
to be the method at hand for some of these attacks.
Of interest some old SGI hardware had branch delay slot bug that
required the kernel to inspect the binary and preload paged.  Should the
branch delay code trigger a fault things got messy so the kernel checked
and made sure there was no fault generated.     Binary objects
were also edited by the system to not have a fault at a page boundary
by the runtime link loader and editor.

   - "Although covert channels with bandwidth of over 1 bit/second may be

@_subject: [Cryptography] how to encrypt for the very long term? 
Wrong direction opens another pile of bits.
There is both: store securely and also destroy securely.
For example if I had an encrypted archive of your data in escrow for you
and you want it deleted that could be done by scrubbing that specific key.
As long a there was no unmanaged copy of the key that scrubb would be
as effective as the original encryption.   The owner of the data can and
likely should do the encryption.  The storage service might elect to encrypt
the data one more time to secure their contract services with value add.
Valuable data should never be delivered to a storage service unencrypted be
it by wire or physical media.
Since long term storage is still the world of tape stored in a cave the
tape removal and physical destruction is a risk as it opens the gate for
the other
tapes in the vault.   Thus expect media to be there for a long time unless
you are Amazon or Google and own the whole cave.  The risk of getting the
wrong tape cartridge is still real even if you own the cave.
Tape archives (tar) are nicely structured for some of this.
The archive file can be made with or without padding, encrypted,
transported electronically to the tape writer then committed to media.
Compression first but only once I suspect.
Things then boil down to key management for the life of the media.
Media life, ECC and rewriting an archive to a future media should be
part of the design.   In the rewrite process the data should not be in the
ECC and checksum by tape and tape block should be part of the storage
service metadata.   A good 20 year old tape needs a compatible reader and
in my experience the tape reader is the weak link.
Filesystems with MAC or ownership meta data depend on the operating system
enforce visibility, encrypted or not.   It is unlikely that data sets have
a single owner
any more.  The tools that manage multiple owners needs to be part of the
management and storage design.   i.e. on another turn your fragile key for
our shared file and
my strong key would be a risk and results in data no safer than your
fragile key.
The meta data is critical as well.  An oracle database will have users and
metadata that "the oracle system" manages and enforces outside the policy
of the OS.  Understanding policy layers, tools and what flows from what
not be overlooked.
Interesting problem especially in light of quantum tools inside of 20 years
I like the notion of "easily just write the file as is (without any
filesystem) into the dmcrypt
block device" but that leaves backing up the resources to read the dmcrypt
block device in the
critical path for 20 years.   It also allows the block device to be raw
block by block archived to
tape or a remote service for archiving.

return random bits on demand.  A generator can be quick and if the system
*rand() services are suspect
it can ignore them or if they are golden use the heck out of them. It can
be poked with signals to fetch hardware
random bits from some other good local or far service.  If a PRNG is
sufficient this might  isolate this design problem
into one object.
It might be possible to build a generator using tricks that node uses to be
such a  quick web server.
Fork is safe in some constrained well managed cases.
What if the parent never sees random bits  or other secrets and simply
forks() to get work done knowing that it is safe to
do so because there are no secrets in the parent to worry about.   Now the
child can make a call to a system *rand device
check the return value so it knows it got enough and then go to work.

an error.   What process can wait()
to  catch child exit/death signals (no zombies or orphans please)?   Is an

A mixed font, key strategy might allow the sharing of keys almost in the clear
because the "secret" is the use and abuse of fonts.   It can also eliminate
casual shoulder surfing and key loss.
A web page... local-file or remote allows font  and language games as

@_subject: [Cryptography] Does RISC V solve Spectre ? 
At one level RISC V is an instruction set.
The problem is not with the instruction sets as much as it is the way the
processor is implemented.
These folk  at SiFive can say that their RISC V part
has eliminated the issue (may never have had it).
RISC-V says..
"No announced RISC-V silicon is susceptible, and the popular
open-source RISC-V Rocket processor
is unaffected as it does not perform memory accesses speculatively."
So someone could build a bad part but has not done so and put it on the market.
One way to add problems is with memory subsystems that have their own cache.
Another interesting mitigation to go fast might be to move the kernel
into a PCI card
that has access to memory but the OS lives on a part on that board.
The old time sharing systems had the OS live on a channel processor.
Some modest design tricks could make this a lot easier.
Some of the exploits in the  Meltdown and Spectre pair seem to be a
race condition
where the negation or validation of cache or prefetched data are invalid.
The inverse of overclocking could close those timing windows if they
are race-conditions.
DRAM interfaces may also be detuned (slowed) to close race-conditions.
BIOS updates control come of these clock timing settings... Look for
BIOS updates
and "overclock vs. saferclock" settings.
Interesting stuff.

This is in part what the VLIW designs wanted to do.
The folks I know that worked on MultiFlow say this is hard as heck.
A VLIW machine needs very wide data paths for instructions. <---
Important... system design not ISA.
Also the internals of modern machines are a hybrid of RISC and
very long instruction hardware. The decoder triggers microcode from
the external instruction set.
It may be that the internals could be microcoded to a safer but not
x86-64 instruction set.  To my knowledge none of the fast x86-64 hardware
folk have disclosed their micro code, microinstruction hardware and the limits
that it can be tinkered with.
x86-64 has a lot of instructions and by killing some or so hobbling them
the compiler folk could revisit their code generation and still have processes
run close to the current speed.
The VAX had microcode.
The 68000 and 68010 had microcode that was on a hard wired ROM.
Some "big boys" burned their own magical 68000 microcode for special purposes.

It seems to me that Apple cannot have a single key set for all their devices.
They will be necessarily different for each model so already not a single key.
What cryptographic strategy might allow Apple or a Google to have
+1024 secret keys
and when a device is updated each device would be vectored to exactly
one server in +1024 for authentication and a specific signed update.
Such a strategy could mitigate the loss of any one key...
A random assignment of the key to each device would make it impossible
to request a single key.   Discovery of the key assignment could only happen in
the update cycle.   Should a single key be cracked an updated system image
for that 1/+1024 of the install base might establish a new secret set.
Classic salt in passwords, could be used to vector requests and traffic
in interesting ways.
One technical response is that any side door for US law enforcement
will encounter like demands by any and all other law enforcement
globally.  <-- globally If it was technically possible (and it is not) then the multitude of
secret keepers
would muddy the waters and allow foreign agents to insert or delete data
to their own ends.  So if it was possible for one it is clearly not possible
for many.
As we are learning the Russian view of law and our view are at odds.
The same can be shown for China, N&S Korea, countries that are well funded
by drug trade and more.
Commerce today depends on a trusted platform and management of that trusted
platform depends on a secure device.   Phones play an important part in this.
One reality is that a device sold in France with French secrets would not be
an open book at the US border and vice versa. With 193 United Nations nations
the permutations of transit are very large with only one stop.   And
those that travel
commonly make multiple border crossings.
The implication is that any US mandate would impact US citizens only and
US prohibitions on warrantless searches of US citizens would apply fully.
One additional impact of a loss of security would risk US commerce and
that is one of the
constitutional mandates in the Commerce Clause of the US constitution.
Missing in all this is the growing part that data security on phones
plays in all commerce.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Various CPU cache side channels 
There is a bit of hope.
See Page Attribution Tables and IOMMU
It is possible to map memory and bypass the cache system on most
modern processors.
The performance stinks but secrets can be outside the view of the cache system.
Other older system hardware needs to be looked at too.
Consider the AMD hypertransport bus.
A mother board can have N processors each with a DRAM controller interconnected
with this HT bus and each processor can access RAM in its own and the
other processors
all viewed as a single 40 bit address space.
There is also the SGI NUMA Link (Dan Lenoski and others at
Stanford/SGI) again with routed data links
to all the memory and I/O in the system.
Transputers and that interconnect  notion might be reviewed in the
world of a sea of processors none with a
TLB or cache.   Purpose wiring them as functional blocks in a
problem's solution may avoid these attacks.
Tear the blocks apart and reload and rewire them for the next task.
As long as the TLB blocks or stalls correctly an invalid memory read
by speculation should be data safe.
Timing safe is never a given ...  Knowing the key length alone sorts
out the easier to attack devices.
The R8000 system at SGI was tightly coupled to RAM with the processor
memory interface
fully pipelined out to DRAM.  There was no R8000+1 because all the
chips would have to be
respun and updated for an new memory subsystem.   This was an
interesting way to run through code
in a pipelined vector style.
The sysad bus on other MIPS/SGI processors was a bottleneck never addressed.
Bigger and more flexible TLB systems with variable page sizes might
help.  Page flipping for networking
is one example.
The Z80 had a clever solution for a context switch but no protection.
The big solution problem space is system design.   To correctly solve
these problems and also go fast there needs to be
a massive system rebuild from UART chips to system buses for memory,
I/O and display.  GPUs and the CUDA model
needs looking at for the good and bad bits.   Solid state storage
memory and a good I/O DMA strategy could roll code
in an out of harms way much like SCOPE and old  mainframe operating
systems.   This notion can solve service cloud
problems that do not need a *nix system.   Perhaps seL4 style.
The SOC folk do not get a free ride.   The SOC designs are blobs of
hardware description code often under NDA hidden behind another NDA.
The invisibility of the internals of these blobs hides another risk
class of problems.   Some are under NDA because hardware
designs are full of something borrowed and something new.   The
borrowed bit is a liability and the new an asset.
Enumeration of all the parts and credits to a design is a tangle.
Open source hardware is not handy because of cost but the programmable
parts are
getting faster and bigger.

Critical PGP and S/MIME bugs can reveal encrypted emails—uninstall /

One assertion is that old messages can be exposed too.
Twitter is full of posts this AM.
Sebastian Schinzel
" We'll publish critical vulnerabilities in PGP/GPG and S/MIME email
encryption on 2018-05-15 07:00 UTC. They might reveal the plaintext of
encrypted emails, including encrypted emails sent in the past.  1/4 "
Schinzel referred people this blog post published late Sunday night by the
Electronic Frontier Foundation. It said: “EFF has been in communication
with the research team, and can confirm that these vulnerabilities pose an
immediate risk to those using these tools for email communication,
including the potential exposure of the contents of past messages.”
The post continued:
Our advice, which mirrors that of the researchers, is to immediately
disable and/or uninstall tools that automatically decrypt PGP-encrypted
email. Until the flaws described in the paper are more widely understood
and fixed, users should arrange for the use of alternative end-to-end
secure channels, such as Signal, and temporarily stop sending and
especially reading PGP-encrypted email.
Both Schinzel and the EFF blog post referred those affected to EFF
instructions for disabling plugins in Thunderbird, macOS Mail, and Outlook.
The instructions say only to "disable PGP integration in e-mail clients."
Interestingly, there's no advice to remove PGP apps such as Gpg4win or GNU
Privacy Guard. Once the plugin tools are removed from Thunderbird, Mail, or
Outlook, the EFF post said, "your emails will not be automatically
decrypted." On Twitter, EFF officials went on to say: "do not decrypt
encrypted PGP messages that you receive using your email client."

    Patric Brunschwig -- 6 hours ago
Today, information about the Efail  vulerability was
released. This weakness was adressed in Enigmail 2.0, released in March
2018. Unfortunately, this vulnerability does not only cover Enigmail, but
also Thunderbird. Thunderbird is not yet completely fixed today; the
developers are still working on fixing the vulnerabiliy on their side.
I therefore recommend that you install the latest versions of Thunderbird
and Enigmail (currently 52.7 and 2.0.3 respectively), and disable viewing
HTML mails in Thunderbird via menu View > Message Body as > Plain Text.
This will prevent you from any form of the the vulnerability described.
Furthermore, once Thunderbird 52.8 will be released, I recommend to upgrade
as soon as possible.
Ther eare two different attacks outlined in the Efail paper. One targets
directly, and GnuPG has had mitigations against it for almost twenty
years. Reports saying that GnuPG is vulnerable are wrong.
The other one targets buggy MIME parsing by email clients. Enigmail
previously had some susceptibility to it, but as of Enigmail 2.0 we've
closed up all the leaks on our side of things. There is still a small
bit of attack surface in Thunderbird. The code to fix that has been
checked into Thunderbird and will be part of the next Thunderbird release.

I assume you do want compression.

Data compresses differently so compression needs to be adaptive.
Abuse of decompression bombs intentional or not is a consideration.

Even if secrets are well hashed the phrases and keys information needs to
be well managed.
So there is hidden in this a pass word management function a key management

That is a difficult topic.  It need not be all present at day one but for

A key management tool seems central to this project.
It needs to remember keys sent to you, remember keys used, as well as keys
It needs a function "Was this used before?" which need only test a table of

In an audit litigious world with millions of $$ on the line some proof that
the data intended to be sent was sent and the key communicated correctly
makes sense.

Simply sharing the encryption key allows any with the shared pass phrase

while in transport.  The structure of the package needs to allow signatures

This NASA image might be more than big enough. ;-). 1.8 Billion pixels.
It is easy to hide "dead" javascript code and data in web pages to
bootstrap encoding and decoding.
A problem with one time pads is the pad itself with multiple future
pages.  The Terakey(tm) idea has some
risk in this regard.  The shared key is evidence even if decoding the
message is unlikely.
Tricks like pseudo Captcha Verification that use a phone keypad like
array of images can direct someone to an error page fooNNNN where NNNN
a generated key to seed a PRNG and walk the image extracting bits.
Ray would know to click on the images of bears ignoring instructions.
All this is to say that key management is still key and hiding the key
safely involves something you know or can rediscover.
John 2.43 could be John Bolton's book and "HAVOC" the key. John 8:223
would have CHAOS as the key.   Kindle users?
A package solution for messages in transit is useful and an easier
problem than data storage.

How is this different from a collection of mailing lists like this?
We need moderation... even format rules.
With social media like twitter and fb there is one durable copy of the
content.  <-- likely important.
That has a lot of value when people change devices. A safe window at
work (oximoron)
a phone, a laptop, a chromebook.  Family accounts.
Then there is the lost laptops and phones problem ;-).  [yes plural].

For completeness... A hardware solution can accelerate operations like this.
If if is sufficiently interesting a memory mapped set of write latches
and read registers
for the operation on a memory mapped device are not very difficult
after the system bus
interface is in place.    Latency to I/O might make multiple registers
FPGA parts open the door to functions expensive on the CPU becoming inexpensive
on the FPGA.
In history the NSA may have had odd opcodes included on some CPUs.
see popcount.  "an instruction called popcount, short for ?population
count?. Here?s what it
does: it counts the number of set bits in a machine word. For example
(assuming 8-bit words
for simplicity), popcount(00100110) is 3 and popcount(01100000) is 2."
The point is expensive software on some processors can be accelerated
with special hardware.
Barrel shifting was a win for bit mapped graphics, transistors well spent.
Deep pockets can get microcode changes made on some parts.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Secret sharing for family members 
This if solved will solve the large key escrow problem.
It allows legal actions to disclose keys without a legal framework
that is durable (unlikely).
Some will do well to use the old ribbon and wax seal.
Some will do well to use signed and sealed envelopes.
Noodler's Ink has a invisible ink (UV visible) and also archival
and tamper proof inks.
Friendly families can exchange locking fireproof boxes.
I am trying to do this and it is tedious to keep encrypted files
backed up updated and synchronized.
I would like to use a cloud service for data.
More devices have biometric locks.   The Internet is unfriendly so a
multi factor authentication
scheme is growing and each resource has its own tangle.
I tend to add a password a month and a change a month to my lists.
Synchronization and distribution update
seems to be as big a challenge as sharing the secret.   Vendors never
toss data so it is prudent to update passwords.
A venn diagram of what can unlock what is hard to remember and
visualize.   I have
one circular list on purpose.  Some are trees of authentication.
Companies have the same problem.   While we are over-thinking it the
problem is worthy of thought.
Start with work and personal how to keep separated. Does the boss get
the package or does IT security (flat or complex policy).
Then organize by risk and value of loss.
Backups need keys.
