@_subject: [Cryptography] Where are zero knowledge proofs actually used in 
Zcash are using them to anonymise payments:
    Our zero-knowledge proving scheme makes it possible to hide values
  and other identifying information from the public. Using advanced
  cryptographic techniques, users simply prove that the values balance
  and that they are authorized to spend such value. (And that they have
  not spent it before.)

I also asked about software...
An Australian working on crypto software, and hosting it within a public
GitHub repo will be seen as "publishing" (no jail time). If the repo
were hosted within a private GitHub repo, and people outside of
Australia were accessing the repo, then it would be seen as "supply"
(jail time).
Note that as I read it, Australians accessing a private repo but from
outside Australian territory will also be seen as "supply" :/
An Australian creating a repo within Australian territory, travelling to
another country, then accessing the same repo (legally still seen as
"supply" AFAICT) is left as an exercise for the reader.
