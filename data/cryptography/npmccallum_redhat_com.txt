@_subject: [Cryptography] Elliptic Curve Key Sharing 
Alice does an independent ECDH (using private key X) with n parties (in
this case 3: A, B, C) such that she has:
k1 = g^(XA)
k2 = g^(XB)
k3 = g^(XC)
She has now discarded X.
She would like to encrypt a secret S such that any combination of r (in
this case 2) keys will allow decryption. Normally, she'd use Shamir's
Secret Sharing. But she doesn't know of any way to apply SSS to
elliptic curve points.
Are there any methods commonly available?
Can the simple "brute-force" method work without revealing any data
about the keys? For example:
c1 = S + g^(XA) + g^(XB)
c2 = S + g^(XA) + g^(XC)
c3 = S + g^(XB) + g^(XC)

How do I recover x from y on Ed448? I don't see this mentioned in any
Is there a generic way to do it for all (Twisted) Edwards curves?

Hi everyone!
I'd like some review on a small variant of Elgamal (attached).
Encryption should just be standard Elgamal (no modifications). During
the decryption step, the only modification to Elgamal is using an
ephemeral key (X) to provide PFS (even from the server).
On a practical level, should a and b be accompanied by ZKPs? Besides
confirming group membership of all transferred items (and possibly
validating ZKPs), what other defensive checks should I perform?

Correct. The client discards b^A and A.
Cryptographically, yes. This could be merged with something like SPAKE.
Alternatively, (a,k) could be encrypted to TPM or physically isolated,
etc. It would not provide the same strength, but it could be automated.
But yes, presume that the state of (a,k) between encryption and
decryption is secure.
Actually, the ZKPs question emerged from my reading of JPAKE. I'm not
quite sure what they prevent in that case, but I wondered if there was
benefit in either party validating that the remote party possesses the
private key for the public key.
Sure. I was thinking PFS in regards to a passive attacker who observes
a, b, k' and k''. I'm probably using the term incorrectly.
EC groups.
The problem is that the authentication requires a third piece of state
along with (a, k); we'll call it S. If the state of (a, k) is
insecure, storing S in that same way doesn't add any security. You can
gain security by storing S in a different way than (a, k); but this
provides no additional security from simply storing a and k in
different ways. Since all three (a, k and S) are group members, S just
adds needless complexity.
I'm all ears.

Thinking through this, it seems to me that the randomness needed to
protect B is generated by Alice not Bob. If this randomness is not
properly obtained, Bob cannot detect it. Does this provide any
advantage to an attacker if Alice is buggy (or has low entropy)?
