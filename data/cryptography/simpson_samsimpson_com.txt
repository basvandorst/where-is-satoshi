I'm not surprised that most people couldn't produce a matching PGP
executbales - most compilers (irrespective of compiler optimisation
options etc) include a timestamp in the executable.

MD5 -> SHA-1 - limited hash size (128-bits vs 160) + collisions in the
compression function thanks to Dobbertin.
RSA -> DH/DSS - back in the day RSA was patented and DH/DSS was free.
Also I recall that RSA wasn't a NIST approved algorithm when DSS was
released.  Splitting the signature and encryption keys was also good
practice and if you're going to break backwards compat. then there's not a
great argument for sticking with RSA.
IDEA -> CAST5.  IDEA is patented, CAST5 isn't.  Note that 3DES is the
only MUST algorithm in the RFC.
Banks/governments etc seem to like the combination of 3DES/SHA-1 (see e.g.
FIPS 140).
My dated but still relevant PGP FAQ answers these questions and more:
Hope this helps,
