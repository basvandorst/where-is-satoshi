Can anyone think of a deployed implementation of RSA signatures that would be vulnerable to the attack Shamir mentions?  Hashing and message blinding would seem to thwart it.
Incidentally, in the 2001 Boneh-DeMillo-Lipton paper they do mention the Intel floating point division bug.

I completely agree with you.  Good public key cryptography should be
designed to resist chosen message attacks.  This has been a standard
part of cryptographic theory since the 80s.  But this is an
implementation attack, and real world implementations don't necessarily
follow all the rules of cryptographic theory.
If you or anyone else happened to know of a single real-world
implementation of RSA signatures that is vulnerable to this fault
attack, then that might give some justification for the incredible media
coverage it has received.  I can't think of any, and my feeling is that
this announcement has been over-hyped (and presented without proper

An assuming read. The article mentions the "Europark Card"; you buy it online for $15 (the web site is still up) and it gets you free parking in various cities in Australia, US, and Canada.  Here is a link to a demo video on YouTube:
Unlike the recent Oyster Card crack (London, UK), Toronto's "free" parking problem does not seem to have been caused by bad cryptography -- at least, there is no mention of cryptography in the article.  It goes to show that there's more to systems security than just crypto.

I would like to know how Dinur and Shamir's work differs from Courtois' previous work on Algebraic cryptanalysis of block ciphers.  It is a refinement of Courtois' technique?  Greg, do you, or someone else have some insight on this?

I saw a similar story reported on Slashdot a few days ago.  I wonder if the malware authors cited Adam Young and Moti Yung?  They hypothesized about such malware a few years ago:

Just curious -- where were you able to download the virus from?
