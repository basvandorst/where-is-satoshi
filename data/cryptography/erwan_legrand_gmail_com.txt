@_subject: how to properly secure non-ssl logins (php + ajax) 
What makes you think these are ill-advised?
Well, it depends on how much security is enough for you. If the
threats you are concerned with encompass the threats mitigated by
SSL/TLS, then you should definitely use TLS. You could arguably use
Kerberos, SSH or IPSEC to achieve the same level of security, but that
would not be handy, since SSL/TLS is what is bundled in web servers
and browsers. Oh, and you don't necessarily have to buy a certificate
to Verisign to use SSL!
The only thing your scheme seems to achieve is protect your password
against eavesdroppers. But then, an eavesdropper could reuse your
cookie to hijack your session. Your protocol does not mitigate such
threats as session hijacking, MITM, phishing, HTTP cache poisoning and
the list goes on. And whatever the shortcomings of TLS might be, it
does mitigate these threats.
Now, if you threat model goes along the lines of :
 * The only asset I want to protect is my password (because I use the
   same password to access critical data hosted on other services!)
 * I don't care whether my session is compromised.
 * I don't care whether my data is captured by an eavesdropper.
Then your scheme might indeed be what you need. I did not give it more
than a quick look though. And I would suggest you reconsider in the
first place the reasons that made you reuse such a precious password.
I hope this last paragraph makes sense and you will forgive my use of sarcasm.

Do you really believe most people use different passwords for different sites?
Let's face it: most people use the same password for every single Web
site they connect to. Starting from here, I can't see OpenID becoming
much of a problem.

Not exactly, although I sure there was some research done on the
number of passwords people had to remember nowadays and how many they
were able to remember.
For what it's worth (i.e. not much), in my own experience people who
actually do this qualify as nerds.
Select any five letters long dictionary word of your choice, append 0
or 1 and you have a password one can reuse for almost all her
accounts. I've seen real people do just that.
Agreed. This word, "usability", is the key here. I used to be very
sceptical (to say the least) with regard to "SSO" systems. Then about
everyone around gained access to the Internet and the World Wide Web.
Then about every new Web site out there started requiring users to
create accounts. The likes of OpenID have their use in today's world.
Looking to this problem from another perspective, I'm yet to see any
sensitive Web site (such as a banking site) relying on OpenID for
authentication. But I must admit I haven't looked for one. Yet perhaps
someone on this list knows better?

@_subject: Hashing algorithm needed 
The French government has been doing this using Java applets for the
last decade (at least). This allows the happy French tax payers to
generate their own CSRs and have them automatically signed by the tax
administration in one swoop.
This might be the only large scale deployment of client-side
certificates in browsers I know of. (And I'd certainly like to hear
about others.)

@_subject: [Cryptography] Now it's personal -- Belgian cryptographer 
This caught my attention as I followed a cryptography course taught by
Jean-Jacques Quisquater back in the nineties.
I watched some bits of an interview of Jean-Jacques Quisquater. The
malware which has infected his computer is "MiniDuke" which was also
used in attacks against European governments last year.
He did say that the NSA is behind this, although as far as I know he
did not say why he thinks so. He said he and others have been working
with the mathematicians of the NSA and at the same time the NSA was
working against them.
Another thing he said is he believes the reason why he has been
targeted is he has been providing security consultancy to firms.
Thus the motive behind all this could well be so called "intellectual
property theft".

@_subject: [Cryptography] Silly Diffie-Hellman question using XOR 
You did. DH is based on the premise that solving the discrete
logarithm problem is hard: Alice and Bob compute exponents, which is
easy, while Eve must compute a logarithm, which is thought to be hard.
In order to attack your scheme, Eve must reverse a XOR which is known
to be very easy : Eve knows A2, B2, A3 (i.e. A1^A2^B2) and B3 (i.e.
B1^B2^A2). Thus Eve knows A1 and A4 (and B1 and B4 as well) as A1 =
A3^A2^B2 and A4 = B3^A3^A2^B2.
