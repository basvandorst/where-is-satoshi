@_subject: [Cryptography] Cryptography for consensual sex in California ? 
The bitcoin blockchain could be used as cryptographic proof that
something happened at a certain time. I have to point out though that
the law lets people revoke consent at any time, so it is a moot point
    "Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity
    and can be revoked at any time"
Sorry if this message is malformatted, it's my first time sending
something to the list.
