Anyone got a test key with a real and a forged signature to test
other implementations than OpenSSL?
Thanks in advance.

Both Rivest and Shamir said that they want a parameterised hash
according to Paul Hoffman's "Notes from the Hash Futures Panel".
Maybe thats not so good after all.
Or maybe the "not so good thing" here is exponent equal to 3...
