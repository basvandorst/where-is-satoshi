@_subject: [Cryptography] Bitcoin is not a disaster 
I think in the long term Bitcoin will be disappearing but with a great
legacy (block chain). Satoshi showed us how to make P2P money, but the path
toward an efficient universal decentralized anonymous payment system still
needs many innovations and experiments.
