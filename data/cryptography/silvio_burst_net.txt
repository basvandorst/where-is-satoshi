In human interactions trust is not based upon a centralized "authority"
either. So having a decentralized, inter-human solution such as PKI is
actually a lot closer to the natural ways of things, than the SSL
CA-based infrastructure.
The human touch is somewhat missing though and that's an implementation

picture ID. It'd make a lot more sense for non-geeks to see a picture of
their friend "message verified to come from [pic here]" than the more

understanding of the authenticity and security of a message (or lack

So what are the options these days (the article even mentions end-to-end
encryption to make such an attack far more difficult)?
Every "crypto-phone" offering seems to go stale and disappear after a
while...perhaps related to the fact of being ridiculously expensive.
Aren't run-of-the-mill cellphones these days powerful enough to use
available software like OpenSSL to encrypt voice/datastreams?
Again...what are the options for end-to-end cell encryption right now?
