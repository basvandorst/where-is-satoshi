This sounds very similar indeed to how cisco/ironport's CRES solution
works. The mail body is encrypted and sent hidden in a series of "image"
files stored as mime multipart/related, along with some javascript that
interacts with a web service to provide login, key download and
localized decryption etc etc.
  All the key material is held on a server controlled by cisco, in US
jurisdiction, and the *only* security review cisco were willing to share
with a UK dot-gov security auditor was on the *physical* security of the
non-cisco-owned hosting site. (!)
  Needless to say, they weren't too impressed and recommended the
dot-gov went with a similar, but on-premise system from PGP instead.

Not sure this is true. If instead of leaking via the RNG, you leak via
the cryptographic libraries *and* the windows socket libraries, then
while there are probably two different teams involved, there is only one
manufacturer - Microsoft.
Ok that would exclude non-windows systems, which in this world of BYOD
means an increasing number of ios or android devices - but the odds of
one end or the other of any given exchange being a MS platform are
good.  Provided the cryptographic libraries are queried in a specific
manner for tcp sequence numbers (which can be enforced) the winsock team
never need know how those are generated, leaving just the cryptographic
library holding both the input and output.

Assuming it is in fact worth zero.  Clearly the source itself has

  If one of the bigger players (such as MS) adopted it, then it may be
worthwhile suing; possession of the signing key would be a rebuttable
"proof" of ownership, but doesn't need to be in the hands of the actual
programmer at the time, it would be worthwhile for a suitable lawyer to
take on the case, with a "john doe" client, knowing that the payout
should he get a judgement (and odds are good that MS would just settle
out of court and take a licence, given the theft was fairly clear) would
be considerable.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Fork of TrueCrypt 
Merging in several replies :)
Could add some enterprise-friendly features too; An OSS TC project could
get a lot more support (financial and otherwise) from corporates if
there were reasonable ways for a corporate IT desk to remote-reset the
password. There are ways to achieve that securely, while keeping control
local to the company (any system where you have to contact the vendor
for a reset key is defacto insecure)
Of course, such a solution is also a backdoor - but backdoors are ok
provided you are in control of them :)
Many programs have a "check online every n days for an update" option.
The decent ones allow you to turn that off, or when on, notify you that
an update is available with a "yes/no/later" dialogue. A corporate
version could check on a corporate-controlled server for updates signed
by a corporate (internal) key (thus allowing integration with key
recovery solutions, which will almost certainly require a specific build)
As always, the question is who has control. A feature you can easily
turn off (and verify in the source that off really does mean off) is at
worst a minor roadbump taking a few more seconds during the install process.
A feature that is on and can't be disabled would be a significant issue.
But would be (presumably) HTTPS from the standard site. If an attacker
can distinguish the traffic, we have bigger problems than them being
aware truecrypt is installed somewhere on your network.... if he can't,
he just knows you visited the TC site, which is in itself info of note,
but not something we can do much about.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Dark Mail Alliance specs? 
With cloud/virtualization though, that isn't a requirement.
Your attacker gets a snapshot of your machine, disk and memory - your
machine continues running apart from the fraction of a second it takes
for the memory image to be created.  Your provider may do that anyhow
once in a while, if he is migrating virtual machines to save power or
better distribute load, but in this case, the image left behind is retained.
Your attacker then takes a copy of the image to a dedicated vm instance,
that lets him single-step the machine (and its perception of time),
examine files and code in memory, and so forth. the VM may well
recognize that it has lost external heartbeat after a few seconds, but
that few seconds is an age in terms of cpu, and he gets to rewind that
as often as it takes to modify the running code to believe the heartbeat
is still there, give him a working shell as any valid user, and so forth.
The latter is probably beyond *most* attackers - they can take your
memory image and load it as though it was a "suspended" vm, but won't
have access to the hypervisor to the point they can single step - so
their attack on memory will be much more trial-and-error.  But with a
copy of the stock hypervisor and the image, they can probably manage
well enough.

@_subject: [Cryptography] New free TLS CA coming 
It is reasonable to infer that most damage that can be done by abuse of
an issued certificate can be done by someone able to publish content at
an arbitrary location on the website, regardless of if they own that
domain or not.  Given how poor the checking for even EV is from certain
CAs, that's probably MORE secure than the process we have seen
erroneously issue certs in the last few years.
For https, that's probably good enough (although that doesn't of course
cover cases where a cert for the site could *also* be used for other
purposes perhaps the domain owner wouldn't approve of, but as those will
usually be something other than a web browser doing the trust
evaluation, you can possibly fix that by not including the root in those
other somethings)
Other solutions have similar considerations. If you look at something
like DANE, then you are inferring control over dns records equates to
ownership of the domain (slightly more reasonable, but only slightly;
many hosting providers also provide the control panel that manages dns
records, and the dns servers themselves) and methods that rely on email
to the technical contact or even webmaster/postmaster at the domain
aren't much better either.

I usually give similar advice.
  I suggest (and provide, on request) a cc-sized card with 20
pre-generated random passwords, and space beside each one to write on
what it is used for (initially blank).  When you need a password, use
the next one on the list. if you run out, ask and I will give you
another card.
  For most (infrequently visited) sites though - if it lets you reset
the password via email, then just generate a random one, and don't
bother to try and remember it. When you need to use that site next,
reset it via email. Odds are good its easier to do that than to try and
keep track of the password, and that lets you save your "secure"
passwords for sites that need it (such as your email) rather than those
that don't.

Depends on how it is intercepted. Common scenarios for wifi MitM are a

*possibly* pick up the original packets in the latter case, you would
need to pull packets not addressed to your hw address (i.e. promiscuous
mode and you would need to be using  a PSK). A point to point link, by
contrast, could have this property, but only if Mallory's intercept dish

The description seems to be wildly inaccurate, but as it is in the
preamble ("Background to the invention") section, is probably not
material to the validity of the patent itself.  For traditional PKC, the
two routes as I understand them are central generation and issue, or
local generation by the (intended) recipient (not sender) as a
consequence of generation of the private key.  The text then doubles
down on this error, asserting that public CAs routinely generate public
keys (rather than signing supplied PKs) and that Certificates need to be
protected from tampering in transit and after receipt, when in fact the
digital signature is intended to perform this function. 
The important bits of the patent appear to be an identity based crypto
scheme with an identity component to the key oracle's public key which
is asserted to protect against substitution of an attacker public key
(although how this is achieved I haven't looked into)
