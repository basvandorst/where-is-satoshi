OCSP is even better for an attacker. As the OCSP responses are
unauthenticated[1], you can be easily fake the response with
what ever the attacker likes.
[1] Would be silly to run OCSP over SSL ;-)

I agree on this and but the implementation of OCSP has to deal with
all "non definitive" (to take the wording of the RFC) answers. That's
where the issue is. All the "exception case", mentioned in 2.3, are
all unauthenticated and it seems rather difficult to provide authenticated
scheme for that part as you already mentioned in [*].
That's why malware authors are already adding fake entries of OCSP
server in the host file... simple and efficient.
I just wanted to raise the point that a model like PK-i relying on complex
scheme for security will easily fail at the obvious as the attacker
is often choosing the shortest/fastest path to reach his goal.
