@_subject: [Cryptography] Our leader opines on cryptocurrencies 
Howard Chu:
The principle of fungibility applies to paper currencies AND to crypto
currencies, therefore it doesn't really matter if your coin is
"tainted/blacklisted", unless you are the individual which committed
the crime.
Every 1$ note is the same as every other 1$ note.
Every bitcoin is the same as every other bitcoin.
An example:
The cryptocurrency exchange "coindisgrace" got hacked one day ago and
now the cyberpolice will investigate the theft. After some blockchain
analysis they are able to link a wallet, where a coin from the theft
currently resides in, with a real person. However, as you are not the
criminal who pulled of the hack, the cyberpolice has no permission to
remove the coin from your pocket, as it is not your fault that the
coin was involved in a previous crime.
The money stays in your wallet. Be it black or not. If they'd start
freezing funds, it would hurt the whole currency.
The link to the reddit post is interesting, and I honestly believe
that some three-letter-agencies might have easy access to the KYC
databases major exchanges. It would only make sense to create graphs
for them and their wallets.
However, that's already on the same level of PRISM just for crypto
currencies, and I'm sure that the "normal" police officers have no
access to such tools. We'd be already aware of that. And I sincerely
doubt that anyone on this mailing list is a darknet market operator.
But Monero is not the solution to this privacy problem, as it doesn't
scale at all due to its insanely huge transactions. Sure, the concept
is interesting, but Monero will always only be used by very few
people. If you want to run a currency, you want to target mass
adoption. A currency, which no one uses, is useless.
And no, Runes of Magic Gold isn't an option either.
