<... a way to make decryption more expensive ...>
I think it is a neat idea.  I think it is best understood as a kind of "key-stretching" akin to iterated hashing of a password, as in:
Secure Applications of Low-Entropy Keys (1998)
John Kelsey, Bruce Schneier, Chris Hall, David Wagner I invented it myself at one point, and then subsequently learned that it had already been published.  Here are some notes I wrote about it earlier this year:
  """
  I've learned that Udi Manber, Mart?n Abadi [1], Mark Lomas, and Roger   Needham [2] have already published one of my ideas -- that of an extra "salt"   used to hash passwords, erased, and then brute-force-rediscovered when needed.   This kind of thing reassures me that my own part-time, self-directed crypto   research isn't too far off the mainstream. Manber's paper [3] is earliest,   but Abadi's [4] (published as a Technical Report) contains extra goodies such   as consideration of off-line brute force attacks on weak keys used in   communication protocols and a comparison to the more widely used key-
  strengthening of iterated hashing.    [1]   [2]   [3]   [4]   """
