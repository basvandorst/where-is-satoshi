@_subject: Private Key Generation from Passwords/phrases 
Hmm. All we usually have protecting us is "work".
Once a little bit of cipher text gets out, on an SSL session or a PGP
encrypted email or the like, that bit of cipher text is enough
information to unambiguously determine the key. It may take a lot of
work to determine the key but there is no uncertainty left in the key.
That is, once used for a bit of encrypting where the cipher text
becomes known, the entropy of that key is _zero_.
Since there is no unguessibility left in the key, the only thing
protecting the cipher text is the amount of work it takes to determine
the key.
It seems Matthias has realized, prudently, that his system has a weak
link at the passphrase and he is looking to strengthen that. The ways
to do that include requiring a ridiculously long passphrase or
increasing the work required to go from the passphrase to the key.
Both methods Matthias has chosen increase the work required to break
the system.
As James pointed out, the proposed 76-bit passphrase is a bit much to
expect anybody to remember and it is always better to not derive keys
from passwords when the system allows.

For those who would like to know a little more about the physics, see:

Valerio Scarani, Sofyan Iblisdir, and Nicolas Gisin. This is a late
2005 review and of eavesdropping techniques for QKD. Much of the
terminology of quantum physics is unfamiliar to me but I think the
paper states that Eve could theoretically get 5/6 of the bits through
cloning and to keep this from happening, Alice and Bob have to assume
an eavesdropper if more than 11% of the bits have errors.

LiJun Ma, Tassos Nakassis, Barry Hershman, Joshua C. Bienfang, David

accessible paper describing a working system where NIST claims bit
error rates in the 3% range while generating key material at greater
than 2Mb/s. Its not clear whether the bit error rate is before or
after an error correction stage but the paper discusses how bit error
rate reduces the overall result after privacy amplification so I
believe they have thought of Eve cloning photons in flight.

  1.5 Gb of onboard video memory and up to 128 processing
  units, these powerful GPU chips are much more effective than
  CPUs in performing many of these calculations...Preliminary

@_subject: Can we copy trust? 
Kelly says trust cannot be copied at the top of his missive then
doesn't list it as one of the eight "generatives" (I may be missing
something but I think "generative" is the wrong word for something
that cannot be copied but Kelly makes up his own definition for
"generative" as something generated uniquely in place).
After this list has destroyed the as implemented SSL model of trust
over and over again, I'd be wary of claiming that SSL allows trust to
be copied.
Even so, SSL doesn't really copy trust, it works by only trusting the
root. You don't have to trust the target site's self assertions about
its own identity because you trust the root to only validate for sites
that are what they claim to be.
Copying server certificates isn't copying trust either. In this case
all servers with the same certificate are the same entity - at least
to whatever needs to trust it.
This whole thing with SSL and certificates is a red herring when it
comes to copying trust.
When I trust a site, that site doesn't have the trust, I do. To copy
that trust, albeit with low fidelity, I merely have to communicate
that trust to some other person.
There are sites on the net that allow me to communicate my trust to
others. eBay is probably making the most money at it with their seller
reputation system. Sellers with a better reputation will attract more
business and sell quicker and at higher prices. eBay makes more money
when more product moves at higher prices but it cannot inflate
seller's reputations because that would instantly be recognized by
buyers and eBay would become a pariah and some other site would take
over. Other sites like Amazon, Bizrate, and Angie's List provide
similar trust distribution services with different underlying business
This is a trust model that appears to work. If a eBayish/Verisigny
company did an OCSP-like service that returned a current eBay-like
"reputation" number for the trustworthiness of the site in question, I
don't think we would need band aids like PetNames or even a
hierarchical PKI. Sites could just use self-signed certificates with a
field pointing to their reputation responder. Instead of trusted root
certificates, browsers could have trusted reputation responder
certificates. Microsoft would charge reputation responders to include
their certificates, reputation responders would charge companies to
maintain their reputations, everybody would make money. When a
reputation responder goes bad, slashdot would have fun, Microsoft
would pull their cert, there will be some vulnerable users that don't
ever get updated responder certificate lists, and the entities that
had trust housed at the bad responder will have to generate new certs
and rebuild their reputation elsewhere.
This, of course, doesn't have a chance of occuring because SSL works
good enough and people will ignore the bad reputation warnings just
like they ignore SSL warnings now.

@_subject: Can we copy trust? 
My understanding is that an SSL certificate is only a method to carry
the assertion that the holder of the private key is the the subject
named in the certificate (with possible limitations on the allowed
uses of the private key). By using the certificate, one does not trust
the subject - one does trust the signer of the certificate as an
entity that verified the subject named in the certificate represents
the actual subject (this is true even for self signed certificates
Copying the SSL certificate does not copy trust but sometimes copying
some certificates do copy trust.
Say Alice browses around the web looking to buy a widget and when her
browser hits a particular HTTPS protected site, it pops up an
"untrusted certificate" warning. Alice goes "oooo" and moves on to
another site. Bob goes to the same site and his browser doesn't pop up
the warning because Microsoft has automatically updated his computer's
trusted CAs list. Bob's browser trusts the site and Bob trusts his
browser so Bob buys the widget. Alice's browser didn't trust the site,
and Alice, being a remarkable woman, actually paid attention to her
browser and moved on. So we see, the "trusted CA" certificates do
carry trust (heck, "trusted" is part of the name), and, when Microsoft
copied the new trusted CA certificate into Bob's computer, Microsoft
managed to copy trust.
IT departments put corporate trusted CA certificates in employees
computers. The US DoD puts their trusted root certificates in DoD
computers. All these actions copy trust with high fidelity. But this
method rings of an edict from on high, "Thou shalt trust ...". These
methods still don't have the:
   // copy Alice's trust in Charlie to Bob
   Copy(Alice[trust-->Charlie], Bob)
capability. The low fidelity ways of Epinions and eBay seem to be the
only examples I can come up with that allow for that type of trust
copying. For example:
   // copy the trust in Charlie a large group of eBayers has to Bob
   MaybeCopy(eBayClaim.LargeGroup[trust-->Charlie], Bob)
The copy may or may not happen depending on Bob's feelings about the
size of the group or the extent of the trust. Of course, the eBayesque
trust copying happen in wetware. To move it to hardware would require
an online protocol and method to register trust. I can see shades of
the old PGP web-of-trust with added subtleties for timeliness and
dispute resolution.
I meant SSL as we use it - I believe the vast majority of SSL use
involves a hierarchical PKI. I have rarely seen the use of pre-shared
keys or self-signed certificates (which is technically still a PKI).

I haven't done this personally but I have worked with people who do.
Typically, the type of encryption isn't that important when you are
trying to de-obfuscate a binary, the obfuscation routines get treated
as a black box anyway. That is, you let the code do its own
de-obfuscation. This gets tricky because the fancier code knows when
you are looking at it or blocks you from looking at it (it looks to
see if a debug process is attached, or if it is running in a VM, or,
sometimes, it debugs itself so nobody else can).
Knowing the cryptographic algorithm can be useful. There is even a
plugin available for IDAPro that will look for tell-tale constants for
you and point out known cryptographic algorithms. Knowing the
cryptographic algorithm is more important after the de-obfuscated code
gets revealed because recognizing a cryptographic algorithm shortens
the reverse-engineering phase - describing a chunk of code as AES is a
lot easier and clearer then saying something like, "there are these
constant tables with these values and they are used on two buffers
passed in with xors and shifts to return a single buffer with a
different value but the logic is so convoluted I cannot really tell
you how the resulting buffer is related to the initial buffers." ;-)

@_subject: Fast MAC algorithms? 
On Wed, Jul 22, 2009 at 1:43 AM, Nicolas
It just so happens that I worked on a DARPA funded project about 10
years ago looking at the effects of any possible strength vs speed
trade off available for different MACing algorithms. We built the
capability into FreeS/Wan's IPSec. Some of our MACs were so weak we
called them Partial MACs (PMACs). PMACs authenticated only randomly
selected pieces of the packet. We figured PMACs were good enough for
video - who cares if Eve can feed you a frame or two of partially
spoofed video as long as you can't get enough to notice.
The major take aways include:
1) HMAC-SHA1-96 can typically triple the amount of CPU required to
move IP packets through the kernel over a no-crypto option.
HMAC-MD5-96 can double it.
2) If you throw TCP processing in there, unless you are consistantly
going to have packets on the order of at least 1000 bytes, your crypto
algorithm is almost _irrelevant_. TCP costs up to ~1000 cycles per
byte on 10 byte packets, 100 cycles per byte on 100 byte packets, and
only gets down to ~15 cycles per byte at 1000 byte packets. For
reference, HMAC-SHA1-96 takes about 25 cycles per byte for ~1000 byte
packets. These are PentiumII numbers for a Linux 2.2.14 kernel,
remember, this was 10 years ago.
3) If your host is actually going to do something with the data you
receive, it is really really hard to find something that the crypto
algorithm will affect. A coworker of mine struggled for to find a real
world desktop application in which you could actually see a result
(other then some numbers in a log file). Finally he found that viewing
a video remotely in an X-window (thats uncompressed video) would have
occasional drops that becomes noticeable if you pick your video well.
Our video was of a circular radar screen with a rotating update line
(I think it came from a screen saver). With this contrived
application, we could change the MAC algorithm and see more or less
disturbance in the video.
I'd like to emphasize points 2 and 3. You need an application that
either doesn't use TCP or that only uses TCP with MTU sized packets to
even want to care about crypto performance. I don't think the paper
points it out, but all are testing was done with two machines
connected directly to each other. Any out of order processing TCP
needs to do will only decrease the effect a MAC algorithm has. Also if
you want to do _anything_ with the data other than ignore it, it will
only further decrease the effect the MAC algorithm has. We tried
timing FTP transfers, streaming an MPEG, and numerous other things
that I don't remember but all these things had too much overhead to
allow the choice of MAC algorithm to be noticed. 10 years of kernel
network stack development and CPU improvements may have changed the
numbers slightly but I believe you need a really specialized case,
probably including real time requirements on marginal CPUs, before you
need to look at faster MAC algorithms.
Thanks for letting me reminisce about a really fun project (sprinkling
rdtsc around the Linux kernel and getting Steve Kent upset (not
really) at our attempted subversion of IPSec intent - we ended up
doing it the way he wanted even though my way would have been cleaner

TCP offload would, of course, help reduce CPU load and make crypto
algorithm choice have more of an effect. With our tests, however, to
actually show an effect, we had to use large packet sizes which
reduced the impact of TCP - I know we were using 64K packets for some
tests. Boosting the packet size also affected cycles-per-byte for
NMAC-style algorithms because the outer function gets run less often
for a given amount of data (IPSec processing occurs outbound prior to
We needed to reduce the impact of TCP because it still remained that
when doing something with the data, the cycles-per-byte of that
processing greatly impacts the percentage of slowdown your MAC
algorithm choice will have.
To throw another monkey wrench into the works, obviously, you may
think "But what if I have a low power application, trying to be green,
you know. So I want to use less processor intensive cryptography to
save energy?" Well, I sat in the middle of a group of people doing
work for another DARPA project (SensIT) shortly after the ACSA
project. The SensIT project was for low energy wireless sensors in
which we experimented with different key exchange/agreement techniques
in an attempt to economize energy. As a throw-in result, the SensIT
people found it takes 3 orders of magnitude more energy to transmit or
receive data on a per-bit basis than it does to do AES+HMAC-SHA1 (it
came as a surprise to me back then that reception and transmission
take similar amounts of energy). Moral: don't scrimp on crypto to save
energy - at least for wireless, I don't know what it costs to send a
bit down a twisted pair or fiber.

@_subject: Lasers crack commercial encryption systems 
Quantum hackers have performed the first 'invisible' attack on two commercial
   quantum cryptographic systems...they have fully cracked their
encryption keys,
   yet left no trace of the hack..."Our hack gave 100% knowledge of
the key, with
   zero disturbance to the system," he says...In Makarov and colleagues' hack,
   Eve [blinds] Bob's detector ? shining a continuous, 1-milliwatt
laser at it. While
   Bob's detector is thus disabled, Eve can then intercept Alice's signal...The
   cunning part is that while blinded, Bob's detector cannot function
as a 'quantum
   detector' that distinguishes between different quantum states of
incoming light.
   However, it does still work as a 'classical detector' ? recording a
bit value of 1
   if it is hit by an additional bright light pulse, regardless of the
quantum properties
   of that pulse.

@_subject: Merkle Signature Scheme is the most secure signature scheme 
So we deal with SHA-255.33 instead of SHA-256. Not a big enough
difference to worry about.
