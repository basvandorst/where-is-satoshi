@_subject: Announcement of NIST Modes Recommendation 
Now that the AES FIPS has been approved, here is an update from NIST on modes of operation.
The NIST special publication SP 800-38A, "Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation," is available online, at    Five confidentiality modes are specified for use with any FIPS-approved block cipher, such as the AES. The modes in SP 800-38A are updated versions of the ECB, CBC, CFB, and OFB modes that are specified in FIPS Pub. 81; in addition, SP 800-38A specifies the CTR mode.
NIST also expects to publish a 2002 edition of SP 800-38A in which the domain of the CBC mode is extended (to include plaintexts whose bit lengths are not a multiple of the block size); all of the technical material that is specified in the 2001 edition is expected to remain valid.
The next document in the series, SP 800-38B, will specify a variant of the CBC-MAC authentication mode.
Modes development is expected be an ongoing effort; later parts of the series may be devoted to the specification of new modes.

@_subject: response to comments on NIST SP800-38B 
NIST received several thoughtful public comments on the draft NIST Special Publication 800-38B specifying RMAC as a recommended MAC algorithm for use with either AES and Triple DES.  In response to the comments, NIST has posted a consultation paper at  with a link to the paper under the heading "NIST Recommendation for Modes."  The paper summarizes the technical issues underlying the selection of a block cipher based MAC and proposes to refocus the RMAC specification to its underlying EMAC construction.
Further comments on the draft SP 800-38B and the consultation paper may be submitted to EncryptionModes at nist.gov until May 5, 2003.
