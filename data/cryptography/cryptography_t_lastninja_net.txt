I don?t think that?s actually the reason we have shared factors among many keys
- it?s usually incorrect use of the system RNG, sometimes due to stupid
implementation, such as an implementor fixing one factor because stupidity, or
the usual culprit being the boot-time entropy hole in Linux:
 has excellent real world research on this.
As for any variant of ring oscillator circuits: I recall that you want to model
the circuit as providing a non-uniform distribution of entropy estimate in the
worst conditions (I guess when heated in an oven?) and select the min-entropy
of the distribution. I don't know much about these circuits though.
