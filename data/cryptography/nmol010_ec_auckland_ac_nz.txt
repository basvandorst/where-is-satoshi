@_subject: IBM's original S-Boxes for DES? 
A number of sources state that the NSA changed the S-Boxes (and reduced the key
size) of IBM's original DES submission, and that these change were made to
strengthen the cipher against differential/linear/?? cryptanalysis.
Does anybody have a reference to, or have an electronic copy of these original
[Moderator's note: Google for information on the original cipher,
called "Lucifer". --Perry]
