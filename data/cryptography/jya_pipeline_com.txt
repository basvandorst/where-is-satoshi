The day after Paul Sylverson's talk on onion routing at USENIX 10,
he described his attempt to get the counsel at Naval Research
Laboratory to obtain an open license for the technology, and how
he got a brush-off in favor of legacy-patenting whose procedure
was more familiar to the counsel and, not least, superior officers
at NRL (who, in the Navy traditional disdain for their engineers,
did not quite understand what the technology was or its exact purpose, much less the concept of sharing credit for naval research with unranked maverick civilians).
Now, the suspicious will wonder if ONI knew exactly
who Paul, Michael and David had been collaborating with
over the years of onion routing research, and whispered in
the ear of counsel and senior officers as if they worked for
a major ISP to exclude the people from the patent who
did not abide terms of joint mil/civ operations service,
that is to use civilian technology to cloak the classified
Open source is a contradiction for the mil, but not, as far
I've heard, with the NRL researchers. The guys whose
names are on the patent are likely taking the hit for upstairs
policy and those onion features below the routing.

According to the New York Times today the US Customs Service will be asking businesses to report "suspicious" customer requests for a range of threatening technologies, including "encryption devices," for shipping abroad.
For publication we'd like to hear of examples of Customs (or governments') contact about informing on crypto customers or about reporting downloads of free crypto if the request covers that as well: how the contact was made, the terms of the request, whether the reports are to be confidential, and any other useful information on broadening crypto controls.

Microsoft's patent for a Digital Rights Management
Operating System was awarded yesterday:
  A digital rights management operating system protects rights-managed data, such as downloaded content, from access by untrusted programs while the data is loaded into memory or on a page file as a result of the execution of a trusted application that accesses the memory. To protect the rights-managed data resident in memory, the digital rights management operating system refuses to load an untrusted program into memory while the trusted application is executing or removes the data from memory before loading the untrusted program. If the untrusted program executes at the operating system level, such as a debugger, the digital rights management operating system renounces a trusted identity created for it by the computer processor when the computer was booted. To protect the rights-managed data on the page file, the digital rights management operating system prohibits raw access to the page file, or erases the data from the page file before allowing such access. Alternatively, the digital rights management operating system can encrypt the rights-managed data prior to writing it to the page file. The digital rights management operating system also limits the functions the user can perform on the rights-managed data and the trusted application, and can provide a trusted clock used in place of the standard computer clock.

The Fox News reports were yanked by Fox without explanation.
We've collected them from private archives and reposted:
  When the series first appeared it seemed to be another case
of Israel bashing, in particular the parts that rehashed years-old
allegations (we've linked to a 1996 GAO report cited by Fox,
and other alleged participants' Web sites). And the series may well be calculated disinformation, if not by Fox then by its sources. However, Fox's unexplained yanking the series is worth noting.
Except for a few comments on the Net, I do not know of mainline
media follow-up on the reason for the yank. If Fox found that the reports are in error, that is the sort of
thing that usually brings heat from competitors.
If the yank was due to government intervention that would
indeed be news, but hardly unprecedented these days.
If the yank was due to private intervention that too would be
worth learning about -- who, when, why.

The Supreme Court's decision against thermal imaging appears to be applicable to TEMPEST emissions from electronic devices.
And is it not a first against this most threatening vulnerability
in the digital age? And long overdue.
Remote acquisition of electronic emissions, say from outside a home, are not currently prohibited by law as far as I know. And
the language of the thermal imaging decision makes it applicable
to any technology not commonly in use.
Conventional wisdom of security wizards are that the emissions
are very difficult to acquire from more than a hundred yards or
so, but James Bamford claims in his recent "Body of Secrets" that
NSA was able to acquire leaky emissions from Russian crypto equipment 6 miles offshore Cuba in the 1960s. Advances in technology would presumbably increase that capability.

@_subject: WAS: Thermal Imaging Decision Applicable to TEMPEST? 
[And more on TEMPEST technics.]
Probably most people are not subject to TEMPEST attacks
in the same way they are not in need in crypto.
And as crypto protection gets built in to consumer products
as understanding for the need increases, it is probable that
similar protection against TEMPEST will be built into common
devices -- as David noted, this will likely come through regulations
of EMI, with lucrative add-ons for "mil-grade" protection.
In the meantime, again as with crypto, those at highest risk
are most definitely seeking TEMPEST protection as they
learn of the capability of intelligence agencies and their
commercial emulators to pry into a wide range of confidential
affairs. So says TEMPEST protection marketers.
Well-to-do persons are buying TEMPEST protection products
after being advised by financial and security consultants to
do so, and they want "mil-grade" stuff to protect against the
justice and tax investigators chasing them from country
to country often helped by intel, even mil-intel, snoops. Drug
kingpins are not the only buyers.
Sellers of TEMPEST products and services claim there is
a huge market, domestic and foreign, for their offerings, which
is hampered by export regs, again like crypto. Export approvals
go through processes similar to those of crypto a few years
back -- submit your product/service, and wait for an answer,
but not receive precise requirements beforehand. NSA does
the crucial review.
Some suspect that analysis of weaknesses of the products
is being done for future application. TEMPEST customers ask about this possibility and what could be done about it. And if
not satisfied they go looking to other countries for products.
Global persons are especially fearful of TEMPEST by their
own countries as well as the US -- whom they suspect of
cooperating with law and tax agencies worldwide through
burgeoning law enforcement and intelligence-sharing treaties along with export control regimes.
I also notice that more gov/mil advertisements for security
services and products now list TEMPEST requirements
right alongside encryption. Once the TEMPEST requirements
were confidential as were those for encryption.
The TEMPEST industry is booming, relatively speaking, and
look hungrily at the crypto liberation model. The dribs and drabs
we get out of NSA are lapped as if myrhh, not for what they
reveal but for what they portend could be coming.
Snake-oilers are rushing to reshape promo materials to fit
what is being FOIA-ed.
Now, what's coming next in secret comsec technology as the defense industry goes after mass markets, scaring
customers, selling them salvation?

@_subject: NSA Snooping Domestic Crypto Materials 
Debate on whether the NSA spies domestically on US persons appears to be "yes" according to USSID 18, dated July 23, 1993, which was obtained by the National Security Archive a while back, for which we offer an HTML:
  Parts previously redacted concerning domestic surveillance are now  revealed, among them these provisions for acquiring and retaining indefinitely domestically acquired encipherments:
(2) Domestic communications reasonably believed to contain technical data base information may be retained for a period sufficient to allow a thorough exploitation and to permit access to data that are, or are reasonably believed
likely to become, relevant to a current or future foreign intelligence requirement. Sufficient duration may vary with the nature of the exploitation.   (S-CCO)
a. In the context of a cryptanalytic effort, maintenance of technical data bases requires retention of all communications that are enciphered or reasonably believed to contain secret meaning, and sufficient duration may consist of any period of time during which encrypted material is subject to, or of use
in, cryptanalysis. (S-CCO)
b. In the case of communications that are not enciphered or otherwise thought to contain secret meaning, sufficient duration is one year unless the Deputy Director for Operations, NSA, determines in writing that retention for a longer period is required to respond to authorized foreign intelligence or counterintelligence requirements. (S-CCO)
[End quote]
Again, these sections were censored in versions of USSID 18
previously made public, an 1980 version here:
  While the quoted material is a small part of the 52-page
document, variations on it are repeated more than
once, and seems to be the one exception to the
requirement to avoid domestic interceptions and
to destroy any that are inadvertently acquired.
The classification (S-CCO) is not explained but some
think it perhaps indicates material limited to the UK/USA
agreement and/or the Echelon partners. A better answer
is welcomed.

I believe this report refers to FBI guidelines whose implementaion
is being worked out by direct consultation with telecommunication   The original date of compliance with these guidelines was September 24, 2001, but after widespread complaint to the FCC from the telecomm industry about infeasibility of compliance by the deadline, the FCC granted an extension in time to be set for each service provider in consultation with the FBI. That FCC order is with the file above.
What other distinctive arrangments are being made with telecomm
providers may be difficult to determine since each can cut a deal
to fit its unique position without having to submit to a general
standard. It is not yet clear if these private arrangements will
be made fully public or if the FCC will allow concealment under
rubric of privileged business information -- or, to fit the times
of peril, for national security reasons.
It will be interesting which ISPs join the big time ranks of
legacy telecomm providers by offering services to fit the urgency
for all uniting in patriotic fervor to kill the ISP dissidents unwilling
to betray their customers. Lots of stellar Internet leaders changing

between models of distributed information and centralized information regulation. The Napster battle serves as the first case study. It then considers a series of seemingly disparate examples of similar tensions and clashes, including encryption, secrecy, privacy, and security. The talk argues that we must take a systemic view of such conflicts and discuss ways to preserve democratic processes that depend on relatively open information systems.

@_subject: On ISPs Not Filtering Viruses 
We've also had bad luck in getting our ISP, Verio, to filter
viruses. The sysadmins we've discussed it with provide
varying explanations why this is not possible. Instead they
suggest workarounds to send the known varmints to null
or to a phony file name or even a file to collect them and
then be emptied periodically.
What is peculiar is that the sysadmins do not tell the same
story, instead offer vague explanations when pressed.
When we said we wanted to purchase (rent) new space on
alternative machines, we were told that would not solve
the problem. That even erasing the disks on our current
machine, and reinstalling system programs and our files
would offer only momentary relief for the viruses would return. The gist of all tales was that I would have to live
with the problem.
However, when I decided in frustration to switch to another
type of Verio service, a Verio rep told me to not believe what the sysadmins were saying, that the problem is not technical but administrative. However, he would not provide detail on what the administrative problem is. He promised the new
services he was offering would take care of the virus problem.
So we rented two new Verio machines to replace a single one
hosting our two sites, and split the archive to fit the two
domains. For several weeks we were virus free, and only
recently has a virus occasionally hit. And forgot about it
until the thread here appeared.
Now, we wonder if there is more to the virus filtering issue
than has been disclosed. Fore example, are ISPs covertly
assisting the authorities by not filtering, perhaps under
willing or unwilling non-disclosure agreements.
Some months ago we learned that Verio had been approached
by British intelligence to yank files from our sites and after
discussion with me Verio refused because the files did not
violate Verio's use policy. However, I learned during that
episode that law enforcment agencies often make requests
to the law department of ISPs for cooperation without providing
documentation of justification. A decision is made by the
ISP legal rep on whether to comply, and that usually is based
on the value judgment of the legal rep and familiarity with
the LEA contacts and/or procedures.
We learned from a friendly customer rep who happened to
agree with our publication of forbidden docs, that ISPs' legal reps keep in touch with each other on how to respond to official requests for assistance, whether to notify the target,
whether to comply quietly and what procedures to set up with the technical and customer support staff to deflect complaints
and press inquiries, how to keep a lid on past covert assistance, and how to respond to competition which may decide to exploit non-cooperation with authorities lacking court orders or other
After hearing this we better understand the possibility that
sysadmins and customer support personnel may have a variety
of reasons for refusing to filter besides indolence and poor
service -- that snooping and snarfing systems may installed, that a dragnet operation may be underway which covers the
territory of your machines though not necessarily targeting
you, or you may in fact be a specific target, authorized or
To be sure, inadequate service may be an attempt to get you
to upgrade your service contract -- as seems likely in our
case with Verio -- or there may be competition within an
ISP, particularly if it is a giant like Verio where departments
are forced to compete with each other -- again as we have
likely experienced with Verio.
We're now on our fourth iteration of Verio services, and would
have moved on had Verio not bucked British intelligence and
a few lesser attackers when other giants had cooperated. Still, we remain thoughtful about when Verio will do the dirty in the face of fearful terrorism or some other business opportunity
to attack rather than be attacked.

@_subject: password-cracking by journalists... 
This is from the UK Independent today:
How they cracked the terrorists' code Getting to the heart of the documents contained in
the al-Qa'ida computer ? bought by chance by the
Wall Street Journal's reporter in Kabul ? meant
cracking the encryption of Microsoft's Windows
2000 operating system installed on the machine,
which had been used to protect the data. That is not a trivial task. Microsoft will only say
that if you lose the password that controls entry to
a Windows 2000 system, your best option is to
remember it ? or simply to wipe the machine and
start again. And its Encrypting File System (EFS),
which had been used to encode the files, is just as
strong. But the files were too valuable for that. Instead,
the team embarked on the task of breaking
through the encryption, which jumbles the
contents of the files so that even someone reading
the individual bytes of data stored on the actual
hard disk (rather than trying to access them
through the operating system, which had locked
them out) would simply find rubbish. Cracking the encryption meant finding the digital
"key" that had previously been used to unlock it.
That was not stored in any readable file on the
machine, for it was itself encrypted. The only way to reproduce it was to generate the
key from first principles: by trying various
combinations of random bits and trying to
decrypt the file with them, and seeing if it
produced sense ? or gibberish. Luckily, the PC had a version of Windows 2000
with an "export-quality" key ? only 40-bits long,
rather than the "US" quality, which being 128-bits
long would have been billions of times harder to
crack. Even so, it took the equivalent of a set of
supercomputers running for five days, 24 hours a
day, to find the key. But find it they did. The irony that the terrorists used a product made
by one of the US's biggest corporations to
protect plans it was making against it may not be
lost on an administration that recently relaxed rules
on the export of "strong" encryption. Tighter
controls may follow. By Charles Arthur [End excerpt]

Revisions and Clarifications to Encryption Controls in the Export
Administration Regulations--Implementation of Changes in Category 5,
Part 2 (``Information Security''), of the Wassenaar Arrangement List of
Dual-Use Goods and Other Technologies
SUMMARY: This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
to reflect changes made to the Wassenaar Arrangement List of dual-use
items, and to update and clarify other provisions of the EAR pertaining
to encryption export controls. Consistent with the Wassenaar changes,
Note No. 3 (``Cryptography Note'') to Category 5--part II (Information
Security) of the Commerce Control List (CCL) is amended to allow mass
market treatment for all encryption products, including products with
symmetric algorithms employing key lengths greater than 64-bits, that
previously were not eligible for mass market treatment. As a result,
for the first time, mass market encryption commodities and software
with symmetric key lengths exceeding 64 bits may be exported and
reexported to most destinations without a license under Export Control
Classification Numbers (ECCNs) 5A992 and 5D992, following a 30-day
review by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) (formerly the
Bureau of Export Administration (BXA)). In addition, this rule, for the
first time, allows equipment controlled under ECCN 5B002 to be exported
and reexported under License Exception ENC. For all other information
security items, including encryption source code that would be
considered publicly available, this rule updates and clarifies existing
notification, review, licensing and post-export reporting requirements.
Restrictions on exports and reexports of encryption items to terrorist-
supporting states (Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and
Syria), their nationals and other sanctioned persons (individuals and
entities) are not changed by this rule.

Optical Time-Domain Eavesdropping Risks of CRT Displays
Markus G. Kuhn
University of Cambridge, Computer Laboratory
JJ Thomson Avenue, Cambridge CB3 0FD, UK
mgk25 at cl.cam.ac.uk
A new eavesdropping technique can be used to read
cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays at a distance. The intensity of the light emitted by a raster-scan screen as a function of time corresponds to the video signal convolved with the impulse response of the phosphors. Experiments with a typical personal computer color monitor show that enough high-frequency content remains in the emitted light to permit the reconstruction of readable text by deconvolving the
signal received with a fast photosensor. These optical compromising emanations can be received even after diffuse reflection from a wall. Shot noise from background light is the critical performance factor. In a sufficiently dark environment and with a large enough sensor aperture, practically significant reception distances are possible. This information
security risk should be considered in applications with high confidentiality requirements, especially in those that already require ?TEMPEST?-shielded equipment designed to minimize radio-frequency emission-security concerns.

{ask,mityagin,shamir} Abstract. In this paper we analyse the security of a new key exchange
protocol proposed in [3], which is based on mutually learning neural networks. This is a new potential source for public key cryptographic schemes which are not based on number theoretic functions, and have small time and memory complexities. In the first part of the paper we analyse the scheme, explain why the two parties converge to a common key, and why an attacker using a similar neural network is unlikely to converge to the same key.

It also expands the authorizations according to which travelers departing the United States may take encryption for their personal use, and clarifies that specially designed medical equipment and software are not controlled as encryption or ``information security'' items under the EAR. Finally this rule implements changes to the Wassenaar Arrangement List of dual-use items (agreed upon in the September 2002 meeting and finalized in December 2002) that eliminate from Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 5A002 certain types of ``Personalized smart cards'' and equipment specially designed and limited to controlling access to copyright protected data.

  The Possibility of Secure Non-Secret Digital Encryption
  J. H. Ellis, January 1970
  Reference: (1) "Final report on project C43." Bell Telephone   Laboratory, October, 1944, p.23.
The Bell lab paper appears not to be online.
Brian Durham notes that NSA has listed in its Open Door archive of declassified crypto papers several of which refer to a Project C-43 which investigated from 1941-1944 decoding of speech codes.
  NR 4242 ZEMA172 35374A 19410521 PROJECT C-43 PRELIMINARY   REPORTS

The date of the last, October 12, 1944, corresponds to that of the
Ellis citation. If this is the paper Ellis is referring to, it is worth
noting the dates of the earlier reports, two in 1941 and one in 1943.

@_subject: "PGP Encryption Proves Powerful" 
If the FBI cannot crack PGP that does not mean other
agencies with greater prowess cannot. It is unlikely that
the capability to crack PGP would be publicly revealed
for that would close an invaluable source of information.
Intel crackers hardly ever reveal their most essential
tools, though there are orchestrated releases of
capability to mislead.
In the case of the VENONA decrypts, there have been
only partial public releases, along with misleading stories
about how the decrypts were done -- the official story they
were done only by dedicated cryptanalysts without help
of code books or other assists, that Russian carelessness
of OTP preparation provided the crib. Unofficial stories are that Russian codebooks were used, at least for some of the
decrypts -- Thomas Powers, for one, recounts this version
in several reprinted essays in "The Intelligence Wars." That
cover stories have been arranged for how the deciphering was actually done, some not privy to the hardworking NSA
An undisclosed amount of the VENONA messages remain
undeciphered, or at least not made public. Speculation is
that NSA and whomever do not want to tell the full story of
the decrypt capability, again, as with most intelligence agencies it is more beneficial to never reveal full capabilities,
in particular not to temporary allies with the understanding
that allies always spy on each other, whether those are US TLAs or foreign friends.
Ther recent opening of domestic cooperation among the intel
agencies and law enforcement will not likely get any of them
to share fully.
Still, it is impressive that PRZ valiantly argues that PGP is
algorithmically impregnable. That should satisfy its users as
well as its crackers. An uncracked code is the perfect spying
tool. Based on a mulitude of accounts of sophisticated espionage deceptions it might be suspected that is the origin of PK crypto, and why it was leaked, and leaked again, and
crypto export was eased, then greased again.
Presumably there will be periodic reports of cryptographic
impregnability to foster wider if not wiser use.

We'd like to publish examples of GSM threatening researchers,

While not likely, did the recent GSM crackers mention at
Crypto 2003 any concern about being threatened by GSM

from public distribution in order to head off a threat.
Times are weird for researchers these days. Self-censorship
is a temptation when research funds are placed at risk, or
worse, when institutions and publishers run scared from potential threats and warn scholars to tread carefully.

"Instant Ciphertext-Only Cryptanalysis of GSM Encrypted
Communications," by Elad Barkan, Eli Biham, Nathan Keller
    (18 Pages, 234KB)
Abstract. In this paper we present a very practical cipher-text only
cryptanalysis of GSM encrypted communications, and various active
attacks on the GSM protocols. These attacks can even break into
GSM networks that use "unbreakable" ciphers. We describe a
ciphertext-only attack on A5/2 that requires a few dozen milliseconds
of encrypted off-the-air cellular conversation and finds the correct
key in less than a second on a personal computer. We then extend
this attack to a (more complex) ciphertext-only attack on A5/1. We
describe new attacks on the protocols of networks that use A5/1, A5/3,
or even GPRS. These attacks are based on security flaws of the GSM
protocols, and work whenever the mobile phone supports A5/2. We
emphasize that these attacks are on the protocols, and are thus
applicable whenever the cellular phone supports a weak cipher, for
instance they are also applicable using the cryptanalysis of A5/1.
Unlike previous attacks on GSM that require unrealistic information,
like long known plaintext periods, our attacks are very practical and
do not require any knowledge of the content of the conversation.
These attacks allow attackers to tap conversations and decrypt
them either in real-time, or at any later time. We also show active
attacks, such as call hijacking, altering data messages and call

@_subject: [Cryptography] RSA is dead. 
Cyber threats are a place where defense really can work.  It is such a shame the US government chose to militarize the internet instead of making it safer for everyone.  Safer for everyone, they are too jealous for that.
Schneier and others are making the same argument. That is one
of the reasons to appoint a civilian to head NSA, leaving Cybercom
to the military. Recall that DoD resisted setting up Cybercom but
was bribed to do it by Congress which wanted it to be given
a military couture with concomitant secret budgeting propounded
by lobbyists of the giant defense firms eager to protect their
interests threatened by win down of GWOT.
Militarization of the Internet could harm the US more than a
foreign power by elevating suspicion not only about the US
but the entire Internet. That could then lead to Balkanization
into regional and national nets with border controls. That then
leads to paranoia and ethnic suspicion about incursions,
violations, chauvinism and cultural isolationism which the
Internet aimed to overcome.
Behind all this is excessive official secrecy driven by parochial
national security interests -- governmental, economic, industrial,
political, and social. Undergirding the secrecy is secret funding
for parochial ideology, that is, patriotism and chauvinism.
So it is not only the military and spies to be blamed, it is the
entire private enterprise, led by the financial industry, exploiting
sacred national security for pecuniary gain.
It takes little knowledge of history to know this is what leads
to war, not polite cyberwar and diplomatic tussling, but the
bloody kind usually called war profiteering.
To scapegoat and stimatize RSA as if it is the only opportunist
is folly. To scapegoat and stigmatize Obama and the spies
is greater folly.
And dangerous folly appears in the making in the run-up
to public debate about the piddling Snowden releases, arguably
being slowly released to sustain pubic interest. Withholding
the full stash of revelations is to be seen as placing narrow
interests over greater public good of full understanding of
the means and methods, in particular the technology,
of excessive global spying which is likely to worsen

Cryptome does not pretend to provide illusory security, that is security.
It is a vile, rotten, corrupt endeavor, like life. Chuckle.
Visitors, readers, consumers must be skeptical of security, and not rely
upon security promoters, their followers and investors who exploit
dependency by fear uncertainty and doubt.
Skepticism of security claims and methods is one of the purposes of
these lists. Perhaps the main purpose, although it is commonplace for
these lists to be used for soliciting befuddled consumers to hop aboard
the gravy train. Now and then skeptcism of the security arises but is usually
suppressed during times of crisis when incentive is rich to promote poor
products and services. Governments, commerce, orgs, experts cooperate
to foster crises under guise of opposition.
This applies to all forms of security, safety, protection, defense, hygienic
Still, Cryptome endorses the continuing struggle to improve citizen
protection, not only as a job, career, industry, but as citizens' obligation
to bear responsibility for the commonweal against its inside and outside
enemies, if you will, common math against the deadly germs.
One way to do that is to not oversell it, tone down the threats, reduce
drumbeating, avoid hyperbole for and against, forego advertising,
gang-bang hectoring, circle jerk conferencing, TEDing, prize bestowing,
to quietly invent, improve, critique, test, apply, re-test often, expect to

Punishing RSA is work for bloodthirsty media and its fans. Public
crypto needs much better to offer the public than entertaining
evanescent revenge.
3DES is intriguing. Publicizing a list of other well-tested ciphersystems
would be constructive alternatives to "nothing can be done, authority always

But, Ben, doesn't this Reuters report today reassure all is well in
crypto colonialism?
 Experts report potential software "back doors" in U.S. standards
BY JOSEPH MENN
SAN FRANCISCO, July 14 Mon Jul 14, 2014 8:58pm EDT
(Reuters) - U.S. government standards for software may enable spying by the
National Security Agency through widely used coding formulas that should be
jettisoned, some of the country's top independent experts concluded in papers
released on Monday. ...
As a whole, the panels recommended that NIST review its obligation to confer
with the NSA and seek legal changes "where it hinders its ability to
independently develop the best cryptographic standards to serve not only the
United States government but the broader community."
They also urged NIST to weigh the advice of individual task force members who
made more dramatic suggestions, such as calling for the replacement of a
larger set of curves approved for authenticating users, in part because they
were selected through unclear means by the NSA.
"It is possible that the specified curves contain a back door somehow," said
Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Ron Rivest, a co-founder of
RSA and the source of the letter R in its name. Though the curves could be
fine, he wrote, "it seems prudent to assume the worst and transition away."
More broadly, Rivest wrote, "NIST should ask the NSA for full disclosure
regarding all existing standards... If NSA refuses to answer such an inquiry,
then any standard developed with significant NSA input should be assumed to
be `tainted,'" absent proof of security acceptable to outsiders.
In an email exchange, Rivest told Reuters that "NIST needs to have a process
whereby evidence is publicly presented" about how the curves were chosen.
The curves faulted on Monday had been questioned by outsiders after media
reports in September said the NSA could break much widely used security
software, without detailing which ones or how. "These curves are ubiquitous
in commercial cryptography," Johns Hopkins University professor Matthew Green
said in an interview. "If you connected to Google or Facebook today, you
probably used one."
Rivest's long association with RSA, now part of electronic storage maker EMC
Corp, made his remarks more poignant. But prominent task force colleagues
including Internet co-creator Vint Cerf and Ed Felten, former chief
technologist at Federal Trade Commission, also gave strongly worded verdicts
on the Department of Commerce unit.
"It cannot be accepted that NIST's responsibilities should be co-opted by the
NSA's intelligence mission," wrote Cerf, who now works at Google Inc.
While Rivest called the internal history of Dual Elliptic Curve a "smoking
gun" with an "almost certain" NSA back door, Felten wrote that NSA might not
remain alone in its ability to use it and other possible NIST-approved holes
for spying.
In each of three cases, including Dual Elliptic Curve and the more common
curves faulted by Rivest, Felten said the suspected back door access "reduces
the security of users against attack by other adversaries, including
organized crime groups or foreign intelligence services."
The NSA might have been able to generate curves that pass cursory security
tests but are still breakable through the aid of sheer computing power,
because it can try millions of curves and get a few that fit its goals. But a
researcher working for another country could discover the flaw, Felten said.

What con in the 90s are you referring to?"
The crypto wars of the 90s appeared to have been won, but instead
were lost by misunderstanding of the deeper battlefield, and the craven
patriotic nationalistic retreat from global devotion after 9/11. Dissidents
became quiescent about NSA, warned of popular backlash to
funding and reputation by challenging authority during crisis.
Crypto and comsec promotion was curtailed, sensitive files
were withdrawn, private words were whispered to "don't go too far."
Protect the nation became dominant, to hell with foreigners as
foreigners said to hell with the US. Music to all nationalistic spies
Snowden's nationalism (don't harm the US) has brought nationalism
back into fashion as US firms struggle to maintain global markets,
not least by deploying technology funded by US spy industry, now
as in the 1990s. Technology which the Snowden outlets continue
to withhold, allegedly due to a pact with Snowden (withheld 97%
of Guardian's claim, 99.999% of what DoD claimed).
So rigged crypto is again being touted as the holy grail of comsec
and privacy, by pretty much the same parties united in the 1990s
by common nationalistic and economic interests cloaked in
globalist market-freedom propaganda. "We have to help our
spies because they help their spies steal economic secrets."
9/11 failure of spies continues to be used as a rationale for
more obsequiously, subversively, secretly empowing them.
Is Snowden a tool, witting or unwitting, for this, hard to say,
but his claim of "encryption works" certainly has the ring of
enthusiastic crypto deception of the 1990s. Ring so beloved
of the legal teams fronting the "lawful interception" deception
movement, then and now.
Note that all the hurrah about Reset the Net embraces the
notion that corporations will institute cryptographic protection
subject to lawful interception, the timeless evasion of faulty security
where comsec promises are never fulfilled, and only fools would
believe them, for goodness sake, have you no understanding
of the real world?

Defence report
Cyber attacks continue to dominate the headlines, and with good reason. While the threat of cyber security is often exaggerated, there is no doubt that the enhanced networking of society has created substantial vulnerabilities lurking within its interconnected pathways. With attackers able to strike from anywhere and inflict damage on a significant (but often unnoticed) scale, the threat has never been greater to the reams of knowledge held by governments and enterprise. There is also the threat to military information sharing networks representing a significant challenge: in an era of increased integration between systems and platforms, the very webs which act as force multipliers could collapse. Efforts to counter these extensive vulnerabilities are presently ongoing to an impressive degree, and the speed of these developments is not expected to lessen unduly. As a consequence, visiongain has assessed that the value of the global Cyber Security market in 2014 will reach $76.68bn.

in particular those in infosec, comsec, netsec and data
And like the titans, the others assure their customers nothing
like that is going on, abiding non-disclosure pacts obligatory

And not a few of these are rewarded not merely with information
but contracts, fees, endorsements, featured product placements
in spy offerings, awards (open and secret), vouchings in setting
of standards, educational scholarships for expert profs students
and research assistants, consultancies, recommendations to

What is wondrous about the Snowden releases is that there
is so little about this far broader constituencies which conspire
with spies, invent and promote spy products and services, with
the easy corporate targets serving as camouflage for the ostensibly
good hearts who avow they are on the side of the public.
A distinctive feature of this charade is inveterate lying, as spies

threatended to be killed for telling just half of the whole story

It is postulated to make the partial revelations look like a clue
to much worse, a standard spy, ethics, education, religion

The Amsterdam Media Professor Geert Lovink left no doubt that in his opinion the medium term, the entire treasure of the NSA Whistleblowers must be made and archived publicly. Such an approach has a very different range than the global 24-hour news machine. "Journalists want to make headlines and politics", was the founder of the Institute of Network Cultures . But it was important to think long-term.
The Snowden-papers offer unique insight into a loud Lovink "information-military complex in the making": They showed roughly, "who are the actors and what technologies they use." In addition, they made different impact of monitoring on individual countries or regions significantly and who personally was affected as a group or society. Taken together, this was "for all investigative journalists around the world for decades interesting".

Third, is Jetico inc's "Bestcrypt Container Encryption" trustworthy?

So the downside of Snowden's revelations is that there is considerable
suspicion that all crypto is compromised, and, worse, that snake oil
is not really different from the good stuff for the ordinary user who lacks
the technical skills to distinguish them. And that comsec experts are
in league with authorities to dupe the public by excessive warning
of snake oil to peddle their own offerings, that is, experts and
snake oilers are doing what governments do.
Trust Snowden, trust experts, trust governments, but distrust
snake oil. Wait, users say, how can we tell the difference when
they all quack like ducks.

Special note to law-enforcement agents: The word "state" is
a technical term in cryptography. Typical hash-based signature
schemes need to record information, called "state", after every
signature. Google's Adam Langley refers to this as a "huge
foot-cannon" from a security perspective. By saying "eliminate
the state" we are advocating a security improvement, namely
adopting signature schemes that do not need to record information
after every signature. We are not talking about eliminating other
types of states. We love most states, especially yours! Also,
"hash" is another technical term and has nothing to do with cannabis.

Based on analysis of the effect of quantum computing on Information Assurance (IA) and IA-enabled Information Technology (IT) products, the policy's set of authorized algorithms is expanded to provide vendors and IT users more near-term flexibility in meeting their IA interoperability requirements. The purpose behind this additional flexibility is to avoid vendors and customers making two major transitions in a relatively short timeframe, as we anticipate a need to shift to quantum-resistant cryptography in the near future.

Crypto software is not the weakness, it's the complex hardware
required to process and transceive. Consider the weight of all
that from end to end and it surely exceeds WW2 tech. A digitally
secure message travels a vast physical apparatus with innumerable
opportunities for meddling, from keyboard to cable to router to
ISP to network, to switches, to sats, undersea optics, to the
down stream destination. Radio was much simpler, and advanced
versions of it are used for high-grade military security. A microdot
on a sheet of paper too. Digital code is extremely fragile and
vulnerable in analog reality, total dependent on potentially hostile
hosts -- sysadmin and sysengineering.
There is a growing gap between crypto software and its related hardware
due to the Maginot Line overvaluation of software and underevaluation of
Panzer Tank hardware. Vanity about software defenses appears to be
a growing delusion against hardware attacks.
Math and code, meet your foe: physics and engineering backed
by a huge amount of money. Code dancing on heads of pins is
bedazzling but in the end no better than angelic faith in end to
end crypto.

An early program of Highlands Group was perception management by
which public opinion would be shaped by disparagement of opposition
to ubiquitous gov-com spying with gambits like "tin-foil hat," "conspiracy

becomes habitual with repetition, even among those who are otherwise
open-minded to novel scientific and theological innovations so long as
the innovations are peer-reviewed or sanctioned by authorities, even
when the authorities are revealed to be self-serving and corrupt, perhaps
especially so. That is the crippling effects of standards setting in all
human endeavors, the favoritism toward standards setting obedient
members and ostacism of dissenters to the dominants.
Fortunately, the tin-hatters and conspiriacists overturn the sclerotic

then proceed with other authentications. Toughest problem is how to
avoid another compromise of new keys since so many ways to do
that have arisen and/or suspected over the life of PGP and other
systems. WoT is problematic too, as are key signing parties, and
so on. Other systems claim to be better, and we are using some of
them, waiting and watching and suspecting are the lessons learned

make exploitable mistakes implementing, that DoD hopes
to exploit holes, doubt and errors rather than see them
corrected, that hackers and corporations expect to continue
to sell 0-days for high prices, that Obama staff has mixed
views of weak and strong comsec, that the US hacks both
friends and foes, engages in cyber defense and offense,
all this feeding opportunistic and obliging media fanning flames
with anonymous sources, secret briefings, revolving door
job offers of op-eds, essays, speeches, testimonies and
spy-approved tattle-tales. Essential to crypto fire-storm is
fueling a fire-sale Snowden 0-day attribution. The rewards
of this frenzied comsec-shopping should be a pardon for
Snowden, along with a life-time free travel in search of
anywhere crypto is not needed, just his word comms
are good to go naked.

Yes, why Snowden will not release defensive documents ("to prevent harm to US"), only offensive. This distorts and biases NSA capability stories by design. However, one ex-NSA dissident warns if Snowden releases deepest (presumably defensive) technology "he should be shot."

We've collected a batch of Tempest documents and AFAIK none make this claim.
Plenty of products and design criteria are available. But there might be a particular type of protection that has not been publicized. Standards of Tempest protection for buildings were once classified and some still are (redactions in released documents are prolific).
Perhaps use of superduper protection materials does require a license, wouldn't be surprising due to reported heavy use of acquiring signal surreptitiously. Protection against compromising emanations (emissions) has a long history of evolvement, both for attack and defense.
New discoveries appear regularly, surely some remain secret while commercial grade protection is peddled as a ruse. As usual for comsec, not a few are snake oil.
We would welcome more information on the technology.

From 1990:
Eavesdropping On the Electromagnetic Emanations of Digital Equipment: The Laws of Canada, England and the United States, by Christopher J. Seline
"The use of TEMPEST is not illegal under the laws of the United States, or England. Canada has specific laws criminalizing TEMPEST eavesdropping but the laws do more to hinder surveillance countermeasures than to prevent TEMPEST surveillance. In the United States it is illegal for an individual to take effective countermeasures against TEMPEST surveillance. This leads to the conundrum that it is legal for individuals and the government to invade the privacy of others but illegal for individuals to take steps to protect their privacy."
"Title III makes possession of a surveillance device a crime, unless it is produced under contract to the government. This means that research into surveillance and counter-surveillance equipment is monopolized by the government and a few companies working under contract with NACSIM 5100A is classified, as are all details of TEMPEST. To obtain access to it, contractor must prove that there is demand within the government for the specific type of equipment that intend to certify. Since the standard is classified, the contractors can not sell the equipment to non-secure governmental agencies or the public. This prevents reverse engineering of the standard for its physical embodiment, the Certified equipment. By preventing the private sector from owning this anti-eavesdropping equipment, the NSA has effectively prevented the them from protecting the information in their computers."

CODE GIRLS
The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II
By Liza Mundy
Describes the experiences of several thousand American women who spent the war years in Washington, untangling the clandestine messages sent by the Japanese and German militaries and diplomatic corps. At a time when even well-educated women were not encouraged to have careers ­ much less compete with men to demonstrate their mastery of arcane, technical skills ­ this hiring frenzy represented a dramatic shift. The same social experiment was simultaneously unfolding on the other side of the Atlantic. The British debutantes and their middle-class peers recruited to work at the secret Bletchley Park code-breaking operation came to outnumber the men.
Mundys narrative turns thrilling as she chronicles the eureka moments when the women succeed in cracking codes, relying on a mixture of mathematical expertise, memorization and occasional leaps of intuition. ...
At the end of the war, virtually all of the female code breakers were given their walking papers and returned to civilian life. Only a few superstars were asked to stay on (among them Ann Caracristi, who went on to become the first female deputy director of the National Security Agency).
For these accomplished and resourceful women, who had been given a heady taste of professional success, it was jarring to have to fight to be accepted to top graduate programs on the G.I. Bill or embark on traditional paths as wives and mothers. Warned not to reveal their secret wartime lives, many remained silent about their valuable service. Thanks to Mundys book, which deftly conveys both the puzzle-solving complexities and the emotion and drama of this era, their stories will live on.

Decision concerning an application for a detention order in Case B 3167-19
[2019-06-03] Uppsala tingsrätt
Uppsala District Court has dismissed the public prosecutors request to detain Julian Assange in his absence. A detention order would not be in accordance with the principle of proportionality.
The public prosecutor reopened the preliminary investigation on May 13, 2019 and applied for a detention order at the Court on May 20, 2019. The suspicion of crime is rape, less serious incident, in Enköping in 2010.
The Court has, at a hearing today, decided that there is probable cause for the suspicion of rape, less serious incident, and that there is a risk that Julian Assange will fail to appear or in some other way avoid participation in the investigation and the following proceedings.
The Court has, however, found that a detention order would not be in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Since Julian Assange is serving a prison sentence the public prosecutor can proceed with the preliminary investigation by issuing a European Investigation Order.

All foreign signals intelligence information produced by NSA is in response to specific requirements submitted by our partners across the government. NSA?s priorities are derived from a framework set by the President and executed by the Director of National Intelligence.
NSA?s four cryptologic centers ? in Georgia, Colorado, Texas, and Hawaii ? not only provide critical intelligence and information assurance products and services to NSA?s partners around the globe, but the distributed architecture that connects the centers and the NSA Washington area headquarters also ensures continuity of operations.
Since 2001, NSA has deployed over 18,000 personnel into hostile zones to provide direct support to our warfighters.
NSA and the Department of Homeland Security have recognized over 200 universities in 44 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense and Information Assurance Education and Research.
NSA partners with the National Science Foundation to conduct GenCyber Camps ? week-long, no cost summer camps aimed at increasing both interest in cybersecurity careers and diversity in the nation?s cybersecurity workforce ? for students ranging from kindergarten to 12th grade. Over 160 camps were held in 33 states in 2016.

There are degrees of compromising emanations protection, not a single measure. Portable units of various sizes are at the ower end, the higher end are constructed extensively according to the desired level of protection.
There are also various emanations in the electromagnetic spectrum to be protected, radio, acoustic, visible, vibration, various wave lengths, signal strengths, nearby inadvertent and advertent amplifiers and reflectors, and others not easily identified without clearance.
An infamous instance is the US Army prolonged search for a distinctively shaped object which reflected protected signals passively, no power needed. Seemed innocent so not examined closely until happenstance and wits end focused on it.

In response to these critiques, isn't it wise to suspect/avoid any comsec/infosec which is widely touted, used and promoted due the likelihood it is compromised because of its popularity and wide usage, a handy honeypot for predators sniffing the wind?
Moreover, isn't that the Achilles heel of open source testing, verification and trustworthiness? Not to mention open discussion on public fora and invitees-only confabs sponsored by TLAs.
Trust but verify, and can't be too paranoid, the leery cryptographer muttered quietly, lurking.
OTP, can it be bested by any code, or is that a black hole imaginary?

"Today, Attorney General William P. Barr issued the following statement on the introduction of a bill that would give law enforcement access to critical digital evidence if permitted by a court while also protecting privacy. The legislation is sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham, Tom Cotton, and Marsha Blackburn. ...
While strong encryption provides enormous benefits to society and is undoubtedly necessary for the security and privacy of Americans, end-to-end encryption technology is being abused by child predators, terrorists, drug traffickers, and even hackers to perpetrate their crimes and avoid detection.  Warrant-proof encryption allows these criminals to operate with impunity.  This is dangerous and unacceptable."

@_subject: [Cryptography] Ex-CIA Joshua Schulte Describes His Data/Crypto 
Can't find it now but I recall NSA dissolving remains of disintegrated disks in an acid pool until only a soft pudding is left. This done to reduce chances of meticulous reassembly or recovering data from hard fragments.
Sounds comparable to incinerating into ashes, unless ashes (or smoke/vapor) can be mined for data.
Side question: are cloud server facilities designed as SCIFs?
Schulte trial testimony describes the CIA building where he worked to be constructed of several layers of SCIF vaults, deeper the layer stronger the protection, physical and electronic. That building has been publicly identified as adjoining CIA University, nearby Dulles Airport.

A Federal District Court judge overseeing the matter, Anthony J. Trenga, said that he also dismissed on Thursday the grand jury that Ms. Manning was refusing to testify before after finding that its business had concluded.
"The court finds that Ms. Manning's appearance before the grand jury is no longer needed, in light of which her detention no longer serves any coercive purpose," Judge Trenga wrote.

More on Crypto AG
[2020.03.06] One follow-on to the story of Crypto AG being owned by the CIA: this interview with a Washington Post reporter. The whole thing is worth reading or listening to, but I was struck by these two quotes at the end:
...in South America, for instance, many of the governments that were using Crypto machines were engaged in assassination campaigns. Thousands of people were being disappeared, killed. And I mean, they're using Crypto machines, which suggests that the United States intelligence had a lot of insight into what was happening. And it's hard to look back at that history now and see a lot of evidence of the United States going to any real effort to stop it or at least or even expose it.
To me, the history of the Crypto operation helps to explain how U.S. spy agencies became accustomed to, if not addicted to, global surveillance. This program went on for more than 50 years, monitoring the communications of more than 100 countries. I mean, the United States came to expect that kind of penetration, that kind of global surveillance capability. And as Crypto became less able to deliver it, the United States turned to other ways to replace that. And the Snowden documents tell us a lot about how they did that.
