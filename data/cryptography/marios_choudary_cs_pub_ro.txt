Forbes confirms yesterday's story in Politico:
It is clearly too soon to panic. But I must admit that I have been expecting this to happen and planning for it.
Signal, WhatsApp etc. are all fine but they are all designed as secure networks with a single service provider. Sure, other folk can use their code but you can't contact anyone on a different service, you can't run your own service.
Any single point of failure is a potential point of coercion.
_______________________________________________ The cryptography mailing list cryptography at metzdowd.com Hello everyone,
We published last year at CCS 2018 our work on a protocol that could avoid or at least make much more difficult capturing communications by governments, i.e. trying to remove the potential points of coercion, as mentioned in the previous e-mail.
I think the work has gone pretty much unnoticed until now, so if you have any comments and/or you find it useful please let us know:
