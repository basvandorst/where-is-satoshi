Are you backing up these claims with your own observation on how the heartbeat extension is implemented in both openssl and s2n?

I donât think it contradicts the fact that less lines of code = easier to audit (also the clarity of the code helps, I glanced at the s2n source code and it looks pretty nice to me)

Well you wouldnât want to bore everyone with the NSA leaks with useless or unformated documents.
Other reason (besides the obvious one of not wanting to name any undercover agents or cause âdangerous" political conflict) would be perform an effective reverse propaganda, by not flooding the public too much at once and wait spaced amount of time to publish new leaks so that it feels like itâs news again. So basically, you donât want to bore everyone by talking about it 24/7, or by having nothing else to say because you just dumped everything at once.
