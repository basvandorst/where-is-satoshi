. and to experiences with the previous FIPS 140-1 certifications I was involved in, including a fairly recent communication from NIST that defines a "crypto module": it is not a statically linked library, and that it ought to be an executable or a shared library (so,dll).
Can you say that the C/asm source code is the "code" that constitutes a "module", and define compiler/linker/OS/CPU as your execution environment for FIPS 140 purposes? Think Java, for instance.
I realize this is stretching too thin. and can think of lots of reasons why it can't be. But...
I have seen evidences that this restriction has become exceptionally loose, and that the "family" can be as broad as "UNIX-like" systems...

On a second thought, that there is no key management algorithm certified, how would one set up a SSL connection in FIPS mode?
It seems to me that, it is not possible to have a FIPS 140 certified SSL/TLS session using the OpenSSL's certification.

I realize that, FIPS 140 addresses crypto modules with cryptographic algorithms, not protocols like SSL.
Although in "cryptomodule" terms "SSL's not certifiable" is not necessarily a correct claim. You can certainly certify one big module including cryptography, including the entire SSL protocol for FIPS 140. That would be somewhat bizzare, though.
But, that's not my point. The questions was, how would one claim that he is using FIPS certified cryptography *under* OpenSSL, if the crypto layer does not have a FIPS certified key management (read RSA) algorithm?
Yeah, been there.
I think my current company (Novell) suggested that, not sure what happened.
Well, that is sort of my point.
SHA1 is not a signature algorithm, sha1-with-rsa is, and that RSA is not a certified algorithm in OpenSSL's FIPS 140 certification,  sha1-with-rsa isn't, either.
Perhaps, my understanding of the OpenSSL FIPS 140 certification is not entirely accurate.
Yes, but I am addressing signature generation and verification, and more importantly key exchange: encrypting the PMS and such.

You need to have one zero octet after bunch of FFs and before DER encoded
has blob in order to have a proper PKCS signature encoding.
Based on what you say below, "I used this cert and my key to sign an
end-entity certificate which I used to set up an webserver", it appears that
implementations you used don't check for this one zero octet, either.

Anton,
Here is what I compute in Maple.
I wonder if you are running into an old BC bug. I don't remember the
details, but bc had a bug some 10 years or so ago with big numbers.
