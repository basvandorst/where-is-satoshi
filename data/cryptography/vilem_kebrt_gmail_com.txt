Hello everybody.
Good point,i have to ask myself (i'm new in this and i', no programator, so please don't kill me :) ), shouldn't be so important piece of software, as openssl really is nowadays, statically compiled/linked without optimizing ? (let's say as condition to "securely" use it) ?
  Or is there a posibility to avoid optimization in code ? (for example some type of macro, which will tell compiler - > DONT OPTIMIZE THIS CODE) ?
  I know that you can redefine compile conditions on every piece of your compilation, but shouldn't be something so important released in compiled version?
  Of course the source code would be on other link...
  Maybe i'm naive...
  With regards...
