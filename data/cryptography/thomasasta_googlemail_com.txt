@_subject: [Cryptography] Zero Knowledge for Opening the Cockpit of an Airbus 
I think this is the appropriate list to solve this problem.
Maybe you have heard of the airbus crash in Germany. The door to the
cockpit was locked and one pilot was inside and one outside. Even for the
toilet pilots have to leave the locked space. And the crew knows the pin to
open the door and there exists even a crew wide known and for the plane or
company never changed  security code, which opens the door for 30 secs.
In case a person wants to attack one person outside the cockpit this in
many cases possible.
At the turkish or cyprus airport even glas bottles, Coke oneway metal
bottles or forks from the restaurant are available at the gates.
If we suggest a setting that no one outside knows the code, Does a zero
knowledge approach (see wikipedia) work or is a third party authentication
from tower needed to unlock the doors? Any suggstions?
Regards Tom.

Crypto is insecure:
Why is    using it?
  GoldBug.sf.net seems to be the only Messenger & Email Client using NTRU or
McEliece in an open source implementation, both are considered as quantum
(  )
Will or are there other applicatication follow? How about D/H Online
Banking? also broken!

Crypto is insecure: All can do that, its open source.
even here:
In the case of RSA, Shor's algorithm transforms integer factorization into
a polynomial-time exercise.
And quantum-resistance is an important term. Other algorithms, including
AES, may require longer keys. Research.
And, snake oil.

See also quantum circuits.
And you tested the apps over Tor?
the quantum computing contest has been started
NTRU is open source and implemented, also McEliece
even with Fujisaki-Okamoto for IND-CCA2! Open Source.
