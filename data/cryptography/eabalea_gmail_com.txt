The normative path validation algorithm takes as input a prospective
certification path, and this certification path can end with a CA
certificate. Which can be seen as useless, but may raise some specific
implementation quirks. This CA certificate could be an X.509v1 cert,
raising other potential quirks.
Another behavior dictated by the norm is this:
 CA(BC:pathLenConstraint=0) -> self-issued CA(anything) -> end-entity : OK
That is, they could issue another CA certificate named the same (C=US,
O/OU..., CN=Blue Coat Public Services Intermediate CA) for which they have
the private key, and then issue end-entity certificates. It works because
the pathLength is decremented for each non self-issued CA certificate. I
haven't tested implementations on this point.
As in, what is the effect on systems out there in the wild as opposed to
Browser, maybe none. But some Linux distributions compile and link some
software with GnuTLS (I've seen some OpenLDAP in Debian/Ubuntu, for
example). Some cli tools such as curl/wget, or proxies can be compiled with
