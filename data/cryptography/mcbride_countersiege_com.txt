"They say a secret is something you tell one other person"
  -- U2, "The Fly"
While it is true that most users of smartcards will choose to simply
trust the manufacturer, paranoid users could use a n choose m type of
approach to achieve a certain level of assurance. In most cases
verifying that a card is trojan free is a destructive process, so the
user would test a relatively low percentage of cards and make the
penalty for cheating high enough to ensure that the manufacturer stays
Having the manufacturer provide the random data changes the burden of
proof drastically - there is no way for to _prove_ that they did not
retain a copy of the random data, while it can be proved that they did
not try to cheat simply by testing all the cards.
Additionally, if the manufacturer is providing the secrets on the card
it appers that one weakens the non-repudiation property of signatures
derived from this secret. All in all, it seems like manufacturer provided secrets are not a Good
Thing(tm). The whole idea with smartcards is that _nobody_ knows the
secrets, right?

@_subject: biometrics 
There is a third: some poorly engineered biometric applications
provide the necessary biometric data directly to the attacker: for
example I have encountered a biometric screen saver product which
works with a webcam. It only unlocks the screen when it recognises the
correct person (and automatically locks the screen when the person
leaves, a very nice feature). HOWEVER it displays a picture of the
"owner" on the screen when in the locked state. Simply point the
camera at the screen, wiggle a thin strip of paper in front of the
eyes (it uses blinking as a liveness verification) and "open sesame". Anyone thinking about implementing a biometric system should read
Bruce Schniers piece on the subject:
Sigh... If only technology worked in real life like it does in the
movies.

I'll assume you mean free :-)
You can take a look at OpenBSD's isakmpd (written in C), which comes
with a BSD license. My strong suspicion is that many "proprietary"
devices out there use this code as a basis for their implementations.
There are also the BSD licensed Kame ( and the GPL'd
FreeS/Wan non-RFC-compliant implementation ( to
look at.  Just take a peek at the source yourself:
