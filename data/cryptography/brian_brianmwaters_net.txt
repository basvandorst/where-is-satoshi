@_subject: [Cryptography] Review: The Codebreaker, by David Kahn 
I think at the time of the writing, Kahn might have been the
single-most knowledgeable person on non-governmental cryptography
outside the government. Hard to find a good editor in that case. At
least, that was roughly my impression after reading Levy's "Crypto,"
another great book.

@_subject: [Cryptography] What has Bitcoin achieved? 
I'd like to respond to the subject of your email ("What has Bitcoin
achieved?"), moreso than the content...
Last year IEEE published a two-part article called "What Happened to
the Crypto Dream?" on why cypherpunk/Chaum-esque crypto protocols
haven't caught on in the mainstream. He contrasts the relative failure
of those ideas in the privacy realm to the success of encryption and
digital signatures in the security realm:
He cites a lot of reasons, but the one that stuck with me is the fact
that it's so difficulty for laypeople to grasp those kind of protocols.
(See "Human Factors" in Part 2.) It's easy enough for laypeople to wrap
their heads around the ideas of encryption ("scrambling" data) and
digital signatures ("just like on paper"), but to most folks, something
like distributed timestamping *just shouldn't work.* It somehow warps
the mind and defies one's notion of the laws of the universe! As a
result, businesses and lawmakers are less likely to invest in
technology they don't understand, and customers won't buy in because
they can't even understand how it can help them.
One of the most important results of Bitcoin, for me, is that it's
pushing us back the other way. Distributed digital cash is something
that should be *impossible* to most people, and yet it's in the news
every day now. Whether they realize it or not, folks are slowly starting
to understand that this "crypto" thing means more than just scrambling
and unscrambling data.
With this, we might be in a better place than ever to push forward the
so-called "cypherpunk dream" and get some of these technologies into
widespread use, even if we never get to use Bitcoin at the grocery

@_subject: [Cryptography] Is it mathematically provably impossible to 
I think the point of Stephan's halting problem analogy is that you
can't to this, in the general case.
But I do agree with the following comments that, in the real world, for
the special case of well-written code, it's possible to use tools (like
static analysis) and code review arrive at a very high degree of
confidence, if not an actual proof.
I'm actually very interested in where techniques from the programming
languages and functional programming communities can take security and
cryptography in the future. HM-style static types (and dependent types)
are in some sense a partial step toward formal verification.
I don't think we'll ever live in a world where formal verification (or
static analysis, or code audits) becomes commonplace in application
development. However, we're already doing a lot for reusable
systems-level components like crypto libraries. Will we ever see a day
when we can *formally verify* these components, or at least parts of

@_subject: [Cryptography] Google "End to End" 
After a long conversation with a friend where we discussed the various
merits and demerits of front-end crypto, and concluded the browser
would need to be extended, I woke up  to find Google's End-to-End -
almost our idea exactly!
I haven't looked closely at it yet, but the website says it doesn't
support RSA because it takes too long to generate keys. Instead, all
users will have to use EC keys.
That's fine, in principle, but if existing PGP users aren't able to at
least *import* *existing* RSA keys, there will be a huge barrier to
adoption here. How many of us are really using EC keys with GnuPG, etc?
They're probably thinking users will have to generate their own EC keys
with End-to-End, but that ignores the fact that many folks will be
reluctant to abandon their old keys - which are spread around the net
in correspondent's mail clients, and might contain signatures they
don't want to give up.
Other than that, though, I think it sounds cool and I'm excited to try
it out and look at the code. In fact, RSA might even be something the
community can develop and push upstream. Like I said, even if Google
doesn't want to do RSA keygen, RSA key import would be very valuable.

In principle, the copy/paste "air gap" is not strictly necessary, since
the browser should be able to isolate such a widget from the DOM, by
implementing it as a first-class browser feature. (I picture a scenario
where the user types into the encryption widget, selects a text box on
a webpage, and clicks the "inject" button on the widget. The widget
then auto-types the ciphertext into the webpage.)
However, in reality, browser extensions are implemented in
HTML/CSS/JavaScript, just like web pages, and I am not sure how much
isolation they really get from the DOM. (It probably varies from one
browser vendor to another.) In the case of End-to-End, my understanding
is that the plugin authors have done some IFrame tricks to make the
user's plaintext inaccessible to any web application.
However, I have to wonder how complete that separation really is. When
I get time to play with End-to-End, that's one of the first places I'll
be looking at.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Silly Diffie-Hellman question using XOR 
Hash: SHA512
I wish we could get away from this attitude, at least somewhat.
Sure, someone who's not an expert should never invent their own crypto
*and actually use it.* But if we continue to discourage building
(which is half of building and breaking), who will the next generation
of experts be?
And, perhaps a better measure of expertise is not
"super-intelligence," but a person's track record of building and
breaking crypto.
Granted, Stuart's track record is not looking so hot right now ;)
Keep at it bud. Just remember that security is a meritocracy.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Need Debunking help 
You don't have to look at the whois records or the code to see that
this is some sort of scam. There are dozens of red flags in the
5-minute YouTube video, including:
1) "Cryptography hasn't changed much in over 3,000 years" ...what?
2) They claim AES-128 can be broken in 10 years. I don't even think the
   NSA could pull that off.
3) They mention AES-512, which *doesn't exist* (unless you count double
   AES-256 as "AES-512") (0:55)
4) The narrator claims to be a "former black hat hacker..." in a
   marketing video intended for a *corporate audience*. If he's lying,
   he's a liar, and if he's telling the truth, you're trusting your
   data to a criminal.
5) What the hell is an echelon hacker? Stealth technology?
6) And who is "certifying" their "stealth certified technology?"
Even if they have a working system, it violates the number-one rule of
cryptography: don't use proprietary cryptosystems. And they clam it's
the "strongest grade encryption ever used."
I don't think it's malware, though. There are easier ways to get
malware out there than an elaborate fraud like this. It's probably more
like a classic phone scam, trying to fleece folks into signing up, and
running with the card numbers.
I wouldn't even sign up for the free trial.

I'm not sure I follow. Breaking modern cryptography is hard
(computationally hard), as far as anyone can tell. This is independent
of implementation issues like optimization or FPGA/ASIC-ization.
