Nitpick: according to the meager references I could find, the
counterclaim Microsoft won was that Stac had reverse engineered DOS to
find the undocumented system calls used in the original Stacker
Significant point: both the Stac suit and the Microsoft counterlcaim
were civil actions.  The DMCA makes "circumvention of technological
measures" for financial gain or competive advantage a *criminal*
offense.  This is a big difference.  Furthermore, the DMCA prohibition
of "circumvention of technological measures" is quite broad, applying
to far more than classic reverse engineering (for example, Felten et
al., where all Felten's group had access to were the results of an
"oracle" indicating whether the "watermark" was still detectable).

@_subject: deterministic primality test 
The proof of lemma 4.2, which asserts the existence of a suitable r,
is only valid "for large enough n".  3 is certainly too small.  I am
curious how large n does have to be--my guess would be that the
minimum is far too large for calculation by hand to be practical.
I do find it curious that they don't mention having implemented the
algorithm, but that could be normal for number theory papers for all I

@_subject: Microsoft marries RSA Security to Windows 
SecurityDynamics/RSA Security have sold SecurID for Palms for several
years.  Some previous discussion can be found in the mailing list
archives around the release date in spring of 1999.  They also sell
software implementations of SecurID for Windows.
It's already out here--the algorithm for the SecurID hash function was
published on Bugtraq by a third party (allegedly Russian) in late
They did make some attempt to make the seed difficult to recover on
the Palm.  No doubt it could be reverse engineered with some effort,
and software SecurID on networked devices does change the threat

@_subject: Scientists question electronic voting 
The vote can't be final until the voter confirms the paper receipt.
It's inevitable that some voters won't realize they voted the wrong
way until seeing the printed receipt, so that has to be allowed for.
Elementary human factors.
But this whole discussion is terribly last century--still pictures are
passe.  What's the defense of any of these systems against cell phones
that transmit live video?

@_subject: Can Eve repeat? 
I'm not an expert on this stuff, but I'm interested enough to chase
a few references...
Careful there--EV interaction-free measurements do *not* read the
internal state of the system measured.  The trick to the EV IFM is
that it determines the location (or existence) of a system without
interacting with the internal state of that system; a corollary is
that it derives no information about the internal state.
  "The meaning of the EV IFM is that if an object changes its internal
   state [...] due to the radiation, then the method allows detection
   of the location of the object without any change in its internal
   state.
   [...]
   We should mention that the interaction-free measurements do not
   have vanishing interaction Hamiltonian. [...] the IFM can change
   very significantly the quantum state of the observed object and we
   still name it interaction free."
        Lev Vaidman, "Are Interaction-free Measurements Interaction
        Free?", Intercepting QC is all about determining the internal state (e.g.
photon polarization), and AFAIK that requires becoming entangled with
the state of the particle.  EV IFM doesn't appear to provide a way
around this.
and later...
If Eve can measure the state of a particle without altering its state
at all, 100% of the time, then QC is dead--the defense function
becomes infinite.  But AFAICT the EV IFM techniques do not provide
this ability.
Err...I think you've missed the point of the paper.  What they're
doing is deriving how many extra bits Alice and Bob have to transmit
given that Eve is intercepting their transmission, and only some
fraction (dependent on the interception technique) of those
interceptions are detectable.  They do not assume that all
interceptions appear as errors; they (initially) assume that all
errors are due to interceptions (they deal with the case of noisy
channels later in the paper).

@_subject: Bluetooth cracked further 
In the notes for section 5, they say
    If the attack is successful, the Bluetooth user will need to enter
    the PIN again - so a suspicious user may realize that his
    Bluetooth device is under attack and refuse to enter the PIN.
So no, it doesn't re-pair without intervention.
