@_subject: What does it take to be a security professional? 
I make my living as a technical consultant, doing architecture and
programming for mid-to-large-scale enterprise information processing
systems (mostly content management infrastructures lately). I have a
formal CS education, and I consider myself about as knowledgable an
amateur as possible on the subjects of computer security and crypto.
So, I ask the following question - "what does it take to be a security
professional?". What should I learn in order to be able to confidently
offer security services to my clients? I'm looking for journals,
readings, certifications, broad topics... the works.

Gilles Gravier says:
This sort of raises an interesting question - is it/will it be a crime
to detect and/or remove software placed on a computer by the FBI? Even
if you don't know what it is? Is this being considered tantamount to
interfering with an investigation, even if there has been no
notification of an investigation? On a somewhat related note, is it
wise for the FBI to open itself up to potential lawsuits if their
software corrupts data or otherwise interferes with legitimate
business, or allows an intruder to do so undetected by utilizing the
AV-invisibility channel reserved for FBI-ware (if such a thing

But that's not true - encryption has many other functions. Chief among
these is secrecy, which is not by a long shot the same as privacy. The
issue is not whether encryption can be used for criminal purposes or
not, or whether encryption is "dangerous" (it can and it is - like any
other technology, it crosses the boundaries of intent) - the issue is
whether perceived restriction on the use of "illegitimate" uses of
encryption is worth the limitations on the "legitimate" ones, and
whether doing so will indeed solve the problem or simply make it

If you were going to open up an interface to allow known parties to
upload files to you via web form submission, would you want to 1)
distribute passwords to them and let them sign in to a page where they
could upload the files over SSL, or 2) allow anyone to upload files
and require that authorized parties sign (and/or encrypt) the files
before uploading them, rejecting any that weren't signed with a valid

Hmmm... wouldn't this make for a >less< effective DDOS attack?
Ostensibly, the purpose of a DOS attack is twofold - to block access
to a service, but also to cost money. CPU time is cheaper than
bandwidth in most cases, and hosing the CPU would actually cause the
machine to stop responding with less bandwidth used, doing "less"
damage than a pure network overload attack.
So the real question - is this actually any worse a target for a DOS
attack? (I don't really know.)

If I remember correctly, that's not necessarily the case, but it's
also only relevant if you assume that the attacker is generating valid
signatures (why would they bother, since they won't check out anyway?)
and not just throwing random bitstrings at you.

"Arnold G. Reinhold" says:
I would think that this would only be relevant if there was a
correlation between inputs and outputs. Lack of entropic skew across
the bits of the output shouldn't give any clues to the specific input,
unless the outputs are clumping across the output
space. Theoretically, the hash functions ought to be able to output
every bit string in the output space, so you'd realistically expect a
fair number of runs.
You're right - it should be difficult to create inputs to the hash
functions that cause their output to fail a distribution test, but
doing so casts doubt on the randomness of the inputs, not the
distribution space of the hash.
At least I think that's right - it's been a while since I've thought
about this.

"Hughes, James P" says:
I'm curious - I've never seen any discussion of this, but it hit home
quite forcefully when I was ejected from my battery park apartment on
9/11 and needed to temporarily install some software on a new computer
- has anyone made the point that enforced technological copyright
protections are detrimental to security because they eliminate the
possibility of using that technology in an emergency?
More than not being able to take a picture of your kid's birthday -
what if all of those cameras refused to take pictures of the WTC
burning?  What if my computer was wiped out, and I needed to use a
copy of some software to tell people I was still alive? Even if I was
authorized to do so, the technological "protections" would prevent me
from doing it, because I wouldn't be able to prove it to them (and
this is a relatively minor inconvenience compared to the possibility
that the key grantor is destroyed). It seems like these are more
pervasive arguments that would appeal to more of a universal public
good (individual safety and public record) than mere "I want to watch
TV when >I< want to". Granted, I agree with that argument too, but
then, I'm one of the converted.
Given that we seem to be rapidly moving towards a future where
emergency situations are only going to become more prevalent, it seems
strangely like a serious (physical, societal, etc...) security risk to
lock down all this technology.

Practically, what's the right way to do this? You could do it with a
