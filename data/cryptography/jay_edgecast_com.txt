@_subject: A mighty fortress is our PKI 
I was very interested to read Peter's analysis of shared SAN certificates. While we offer dedicated certificates, the shared certificates we offer enable us to conserve IPv4 space while helping customers lower costs. We've tested and analyzed these shared certificates extensively and in a wide variety of scenarios, and we believe they are just as secure as dedicated certificates.
It's also important to note that we operate edge proxies that merely sit between our customers' origin servers (which have an SSL certificate of their choosing) and the end users. We do not run programs or scripts on our edge servers on behalf of customers; when end users are posting content back to the origin, we are merely a gateway.
Conserving IPv4 space is very important to us - it is responsible 'net citizenship. And helping our customers manage costs is good corporate citizenship. But we will absolutely not compromise security in the pursuit of either of these goals; our customers' security is paramount.
Of course, security is a journey and not a destination, and we are constantly striving to further improve ours. A significant part of that process means learning from communities like this one. Therefore, if anyone is aware of any specific vulnerability - whether with our network or with these shared certificates - I hope you will notify us immediately at security+at+edgecast.com so we can take whatever actions necessary to protect our customers, their customers, and the network as a whole.

A more secure Internet is in everyone's best interest, and I always stand ready to make sure we are doing our part.
