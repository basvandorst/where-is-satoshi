I was a contributor to the scramble.io project above.  You can tell
that I had a run-in with the guy in the comments.  I can't tell
whether he's incapable of reasoning about shades of gray, or whether
he's exploiting a social vuln for personal gain.  Let me explain:
His shtick is to be as black and white as possible, declaring his way
as the only way (e.g. you must use the design patterns and tools
sanctioned by the "security experts", and only those design patterns
and tools, otherwise your product is insecure.), and generally being a
troll and shooting down every new project by pointing out various
flaws, real or imagined.  Readers who aren't as crypto-curious then
eat it up, as it seems like sage advice from an expert, and are
equipped with soundbites that they can also use to counter any new
crypto project ("There's an established way/tool to do what you're
doing, and you're not doing that, so your thing is insecure because
you're inventing new crypto.").
Some of what he says is true, some of what he says is just flame bait.
 Either way it looks his attitude does bring in customers.
Personally, I just call him a troll.

As the author, I claim that Tendermint solves the proof-of-stake problem.

Interesting... How do you remove the incentive for proof-of-work without
solving the byzantine generals problem?
If the message being signed is the same, that's technically called a
"multisignature" scheme in literature, which is a type of "aggregate
signature" scheme.  For a noninteractive BLS multisignature scheme, both
signing, aggregation, and verification is fast, but for a noninteractive
BLS general-aggregate-signature scheme, verification requires N pairing
operations, where each pairing takes around 10+ms. [1]
I'm working on a non-proof-of-work consensus algorithm called Tendermint.
I've considered an aggregate signature scheme for Tendermint.  While it
would be useful for compressing signatures from validators (and so mobile
clients would benefit somewhat), I still need the individual signatures
from validators in order to punish bad validators when they go about
signing things that they shouldn't be signing.  So for now I've decided to
go with Ed25519 [3,4] which can easily batch verify 50,000 signatures in a
matter of seconds.  Mobile devices (where bandwidth is expensive) can check
for consensus probabilistically by requesting a small number of signatures
from a random selection of validators, with the help of merkle trees.
 Mobile devices shouldn't be "mining" on Tendermint, though.
[1] [2] [3] [4] p.s. on [1], take special heed of "*we require it to prove knowledge of
secret keys during the public key registration*".

@_subject: [Cryptography] Fast bulk signature verification followed by fast 
Is there an efficient way to batch-verify signatures (e.g. some may be
incorrect) and then non-interactively aggregate the correct ones into a
multisignature (they are of the same message) such that all operations are
fast (e.g. don't require linear pairing operations)?
I've been looking around (BLS, EdDSA, Schnorr) but it appears that there's
a tradeoff... I'm not aware of any scheme that allows me to do both, as
stated in the question.
Since I'll be dealing with many signers on the order of tens of thousands,
the signatures must be relatively short on the order of less than 100
bytes.  And since they must be verified before aggregation and any number
of them may fail, I don't see how I can use pairing schemes.
