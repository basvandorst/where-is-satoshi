Apparently, Zoom?s end-to-end encryption is controversial. Has anyone tried jitsi instead ?

Bitcoin seeds only work with specific derivation paths which are different for each type of bitcoin wallet.
For example, the Cold Card MK1 dev path is:
The trezor model T is:
These are both bitcoin wallets, but they each have a different derivation path.
If you wanted Ethereum or something, you need to change the a number to 60(on the trezor model T. Cold Card is bitcoin only).
You still need to guess the seed.
To add more complexity, many hardware wallets allow users to add a passphrase which makes it even more difficult to break.
Anyway, all of this seems highly improbable, but I guess nothing is impossible. I don't know how every cryptocurrency works and I can't pretend that I don't have a lot more to learn about Bitcoin, but I find it completely fascinating.
Are you saying you correctly guessed a seed (Kick Ass Bitch)?
