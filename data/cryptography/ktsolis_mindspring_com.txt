@_subject: NTT offering free licenses for algorithms (incl. Camellia)  
According to Nikkan Kogyo News, NTT is offering four patented algorithms
under royalty-free license for limited purposes.
These algorithms include Camellia, EPOC, PSEC, and ESIGN.
NTT made this announcement on the same day as the last CRYPTREC meeting. The
CRYPTREC project was initiated by Japan's Information-technology Promotion
Agency (IPA).
The goal of CRYPTREC is to define standard cryptographic algorithms for use
within the Japanese government.

@_subject: Study on use of crypto? 
I'm looking for studies on the percent of email that is actually
encrypted/the number of people that use PGP, etc. to encrypt their email/the
amount of Net traffic that is encrypted.
If anyone knows of such a study, I'd appreciate the pointer.
