people frequently are asked to sign usage agreements that explicitly state they
are responsible for protecting their password/key material.  This is DIFFERENT from
credit card numbers -- nobody asks you to sign something that says
you'll keep your credit card number private.
Now, the validity of those agreements may or may not be untested, but they exist, so the
path to establishing case law probably exists.

And wireless is a bit of a bitch too -- I'm able to set it up with

It never was.  "Get a life, use IPsec (or TLS, or SSH, or PGP, or SMIME...)"
is (a) standard answer to link layer security.
At this time, I'm much more worried about some Exodus employee going
postal and selling out to my competitor and tapping the copper wires,
than some drive-by cypherpunk sniffing my 802.11 network.
(Picking on Exodus because their economic fortunes have blemishes, not
to say other colo's and ISP's are perfect...)
