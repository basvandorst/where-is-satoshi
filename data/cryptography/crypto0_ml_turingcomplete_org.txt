I don't see where the client's time is used. What am I missing?
Why is this list blocking my mail if the envelope-from is not

If I remember the proof of MR correctly it assumes an odd number. Were
all your questions odd?
If not, please try again with odd numbers only.

I don't agree with that analogue. An paper envelope does not prevent
anybody from opening it (you can open it without any tools and with
nearly no effort). The encryption should make it impossible for
anybody to see the contents.  The recipient might detect that the
envelope was opened or replaced, but you must trust that he will
detect this (you can't check it yourself).
