@_subject: [Cryptography] HTTP should be deprecated. 
I'm very pro-HTTPS for as many places as possible, switched to use it on my
own site, and documented how to do
it in
But I'm also very pro-"it should be easy to publish things on the
Internet", and key management *is* a pain in the ass. Requiring it
Internet-wide would raise the barrier for people new to web publishing to
get started, and/or make more people just use a *.wordpress.com or *.
whatever.com domain, rather than bother getting their own.
Instead, we should establish very clear norms about HTTPS for services and
web applications of all kinds. If you have the ability to add HTTPS
support, you should, and the mandate is especially clear for hosting
For example, one glaring gap for me is Github Pages. It's impossible to use
HTTPS if you host something via Github Pages, whether or not you use your
own domain name (unless you do something expensive like put CloudFront in
front of it).
Caching with HTTPS is a problem. One source of reluctance for major
platforms to support HTTPS is because CDNs like Akamai raise their prices
drastically if you want HTTPS. That's a major market force that guides the
decision companies make, and it's one we should commit ourselves to

A few things are pretty clear:
* Whether or not everything should be HTTPS, clearly more should be.
* HTTPS has lots of problems and doesn't solve everything.
* HTTPS breaks some kinds of caching, and doesn't affect others.
* CDNs charge waaayyyy more to serve your data as HTTPS. This affects the
behavior of institutions that use CDNs.
* Google and others are backing SPDY as the next HTTP 2.0, which would have
TLS on for all traffic. Google cares about performance and efficiency more
than anyone else on the Web, and they think TLS is just fine. SPDY/HTTP2 is
built to extend the Web with lots of different performance gains.
HTTP2 being all-TLS would effectively deprecate HTTP in favor of HTTPS. I
think this is where the Web is going, and we should look at whatever
downsides that would cause and start addressing them now.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Github Pages now supports SSL 
I know most of the people on here have transcended the earthbound, maudlin
Certificate Authority system, but as services-adopting-SSL-news goes, I'm
particular excited about Github
which started quietly supporting SSL for *.github.io domains a few weeks
I'm excited because Github Pages is powerful, verrrrry flexible, and
totally free. AFAIK, it's the only major blog/web host that gives you free
SSL, backed by a high quality CDN (since everything is static files).
To promote the occasion and nudge Github to take it further, I wrote up my
own experience, and a little how-to for forcing redirects via Jekyll:
Along with Cloudflare's 2014 plan to offer SSL termination for free, and
their stated plan to double SSL on the Internet by end of year, the barrier
to HTTPS everywhere is dropping rapidly.

(Setting aside how awful the CA system is generally...)
For those who still have a need to participate in it, and for those
angry at StartCom's refusal to waive[1][2] revocation fees for their
free class 1 certs, what's the best CA for the job?
Even if not free, I'm looking to recommend[3] something priced
attractively for individuals and non-commercial uses. The friendlier
the interface, and the more reliable and principled the customer
service, the better.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Advances in homomorphic encryption 
I am new-ish here and not a crypto expert (a mere web dev) - so please
don't shred me. But! I've been hearing more about homomorphic
encryption and it *sounds* really promising.
Basically[1], that you can take two encrypted pieces of data, perform
operations on them, and get an encrypted result that, when decrypted,
has the result as if you performed that operation on the decrypted
pieces. Data that is both manipulable and encrypted.
So lots of people naturally see potential in making more
privacy-oriented cloud services, that can perform computation for you
without having access to your data. And the activity around it seems
to be ramping up, like this paper[2] (which of course is not actually
available to read, though the related works are):
Poking around Github, I found one active, interesting library[3]
that's focused on building out HE primitives. But it's very difficult
for me to follow.
Does anyone know about the state of affairs? Is this worth getting
excited about?

That's really cool. The homepage for cryptdb, for anyone who wants to
follow it, is  and they have a little
-announce list you can sign up for.
It's true that SQL is not at the vanguard of database practices anymore,
though one of the things I'm wondering is if homomorphic encryption has
enough versatility to cover small enough operations that be built up into
arbitrarily complex ones.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Advances in homomorphic encryption 
For anyone interested in the subject, I've found some more and better
Craig Gentry's original 2009 PhD thesis that theoretically solved fully
homomorphic encryption: Bruce Schneier's analysis of Gentry's 2009 work, covering both its extreme
value and its then-current impracticality:
A second paper by Gentry, and Shai Halevi, from 2011 that outlines major
performance improvements: IBM's very excited Dec 2013 announcement that they have a patent on the
work: It's neat that Gentry was able to keep the entropic noise level of repeated
homomorphic operations below a key threshold by running the decryption
algorithm itself in a homomorphic way against the ciphertext - a sort of
intermittent self-referential "refresh" operation to hold down the noise.
Pretty cool.
Also, I notice that this is premised on lattice-based cryptography, and so
the public keys are much larger than with the kind of cryptography used on
the web, in the order of many megabytes. That's an interesting twist when
thinking of web-scale deployment.

@_subject: [Cryptography] miniLock seems pretty interesting 
I saw this announced at HOPE X this weekend:
It uses curve25519 , which requires much smaller
keys (32 or 64 bits) to ensure security -- and so it basically just demands
a strong passphrase from the user from which can be derived a strong
private key.
The developer has a video  and slides
 to go along with it, and in general
focused his energy on persuading the audience that JavaScript crypto is a
necessary and achievable part of the future.

Sorry, 32-byte. Here's the original paper for the curve in question,
In general, the curve work seems legit -- Adam Langley has an active
implementation , the curve is
used inside
and, trusting Wikipedia for the moment, a lot of other good projects
I know there's a lot of skepticism of Cryptocat in the security community,
and I'm not in a good position to evaluate the merits. I have gotten the
sense that Cryptocat has responded constructively over time and improved
their level of security.
Either way, I think minilock deserves to be evaluated on its own merits,
not just as something "from the cryptocat guy".

@_subject: [Cryptography] Using some crypto to make gov't dataset identifiers 
So this is a little different from the usual fare here, but my colleague
Tom Lee at the Sunlight Foundation has been thinking about using basic
cryptographic concepts to convince governments to publish more unique
identifiers in their datasets -- even when the identifiers they have in
their *databases* is sensitive (like SSNs).
The problem of anonymizing unique data is in some senses easier than others
here, because in some gov't contexts, making things personally identifiable
isn't the problem -- the *intent* is to publish personally identifiable,
connect-able information, like for campaign donors and lobbyists. So the
Mosaic Effect (de-anonymizing Netflix data) is less of a concern. Depends
on the problem, though.
After talking about it on a
Tom blogged it up:
Your feedback would be very welcome, either here or in public fora. Of
course, convincing government agencies to actually do this sort of thing
might be a challenge, but there's a lot of levels and branches of
government out there - you never know who might lead the way.

@_subject: [Cryptography] The role of the IETF in security of the 
the net?
I personally enjoyed what Mark Nottingham (who is chairing the IETF HTTP2
working group) wrote on the matter:
6. More Encryption
HTTP/2 doesn't require you to use TLS (the standard form of SSL, the Web's
encryption layer), but its higher performance makes using encryption
easier, since it reduces the impact on how fast your site seems.
In fact, many people believe that the only safe way to deploy the new
protocol on the "open" Internet is to use encryption; Firefox and Chrome
have said that they'll only support HTTP/2 using TLS.
They have two reasons for this. One is that deploying a new version of HTTP
across the Internet is hard, because a lot of "middleboxes" like proxies
and firewalls assume that HTTP/1 won't ever change, and they can introduce
interoperability and even security problems if they try to interpret a
HTTP/2 connection.
The other is that the Web is an increasingly dangerous place, and using
more encryption is one way to mitigate a number of threats. By using HTTP/2
as a carrot for sites to use TLS, they're hoping that the overall security
of the Web will improve.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Facebook on the state of STARTTLS 
It's quite encouraging, actually:
"We found that 76% of unique MX hostnames that receive our emails support
STARTTLS. As a result, 58% of notification emails are successfully
encrypted. Additionally, certificate validation passes for about half of
the encrypted email, and the other half is opportunistically encrypted. 74%
of hosts that support STARTTLS also provide Perfect Forward Secrecy.
It's clear to us that STARTTLS has achieved critical mass and there is
immediate value in deploying it. We encourage anyone who has not already
deployed STARTTLS to at least deploy it for opportunistic encryption. As
more systems support email encryption, the value increases for everyone."

@_subject: [Cryptography] New free TLS CA coming 
Totally with you. Since that's the case, even a small sentence tweak to add
an "e.g. HSM firmware" might help steer people's brains onto the good-faith
track as they read it.
I was touring over the GitHub organization for /letsencrypt, and it was
missing code for the server. I emailed someone on the project about whether
it would be open sourced and they said yes. Like of course.
EFF's apparently been working on this (in the dark) since May 2012, when it
was originally specced out as the "Chocolate protocol":
EFF sure enjoys making the biggest media splash possible, but it's
impossible to imagine EFF and Mozilla working on anything where the core
components that *they* write on a security system aren't open source.
If LE works, it's going to radically transform the CA landscape, and it
will do it through open souece and principled protocol design.
Sometimes the attitudes expressed by colleagues in my field depress me.
The work done by some of my colleagues in my field awes me.

CT alone definitely won't get us out of trouble. But it removes, warns of,
and deters a class of threats, and is deployable today, politically and
technically. It's definitely far from perfect, but I think it represents
I also don't think it competes with other more ambitious new architecture
ideas like DNSChain, which I deeply admire and want to see gain adoption. I
recognize that Greg feels that they do compete, but I think that CT can be
seen as one incremental step on the road towards more fundamental change.
Ben Laurie made a mistake by devoting a paragraph to dismissing DNSChain
and blockchain projects as religious. I think Greg makes a mistake by
coming as close as he does to accusing Ben Laurie and Google of flat-out

This is exactly why we have TLS used by the public, and SSH used by power
users. Basic security for the web means not having to verify fingerprints
for every service or person you want to interact with.
I hope we're not still stuck throwing bandaids on 1990s ideas in the 2030s.
