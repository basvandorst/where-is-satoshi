@_subject: [Cryptography] Why is emailing me my password? 
You may enter a privacy password below. This provides only mild
security, but should prevent others from messing with your
subscription. Do not use a valuable password as it will occasionally
be emailed back to you in cleartext.
You can also turn off password reminders, but the password will be
kept in plaintext.
