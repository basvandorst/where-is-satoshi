I don't understand this.  Let's suppose, for the
sake of argument, that MitM is impossible.  It's
still trivially easy to make a fake site and harvest
sensitive information.  If we assume (perhaps erroneously)
that all but the most naive user will check that they
are talking to a ``secure site'' before they type in
that credit card number, doesn't the cert provide assurance
that you're talking to whom you think you are?
If the argument is that Verisign and the others don't do
enough checking before issuing the cert, I don't see
how that somehow means that SSL is flawed.

You're probably right about waiting a long time, but might that be
because trying to sniff credit card numbers is not worth it?
Not worth it because virtually everyone uses SSL when making on-line
purchases.  If everyone stopped using SSL, would we not expect to see
an increase in credit card sniffing?
Since, as you say, sniffing on the wire is harder than compromising
the end nodes, the bad guys naturally go after the low hanging
fruit, especially since a great deal of the ``interesting'' traffic
is cryptographically protected (or at least hardened).
*Of course* SSL isn't a complete security solution, but it is
effective in solving part of the problem; perhaps so well that it
makes it appear as if the problem doesn't exist.

Just today I read the following remark by Brad Delong on Eric
Rescorla's Web site :
    The IRS's comparative advantage is using random terror to
        elicit voluntary compliance with the tax code on the part of
        relatively rich people.
Doesn't a similar principle apply here?  Let's grant, as you say,
that the system is only 75% effective, and perhaps the expense
prevents us from deploying it at every lane so that the
probability of catching a cheater is, say, only 40%.  If we make
the fine for cheating $5000 and/or 6 months in jail, then the
cheater's expected savings, considering just the fine, is -$1994,
assuming a $10 toll.  That seems like a pretty good deterrent to
