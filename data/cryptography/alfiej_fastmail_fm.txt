Utterly ludicrous? Maybe 90's C++. Take a look at C++11, it's quite
nice and C++14 is shaping up to be even better. It's not your
father's C++.
Take a look at Go and Rust. Safety is one of their aims, while still
close to the metal.

A physical switch to make ROM writeable isn't new. One of the payloads
that the Chernobyl (aka CIH) virus did was cream your BIOS. Because of
this, later Pentium-II era motherboard needed jumpers to be closed in
order to write to BIOS. This was then replaced with the dual-BIOS
motherboards that you see today.

What a weird statement to make (not sure if trolling). From In-Q-
Tel's website:
  "We identify and invest in venture-backed startups developing
  technologies that will provide ?ready-soon innovation? (within 36
  months) vital to the intelligence community mission...
  As a strategic investor, our model is unique. Our investments
  accelerate product development and add mission-critical capabilities
  with the sole purpose of delivering these cutting-edge technologies to
  IC end users quickly and efficiently."

@_subject: [Cryptography] [cryptography] Question About Best Practices for 
Can we please stop perpetuating that Open Source is the less secure
option? Linus said "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow", he
didn't say "all bugs are non-existent".
Given an open source program, it can be accountable by anyone. If there
is a bug, it can be patched. If there is a deliberate backdoor, it can
be pointed to as an example of why to completely abandon the program and
mark the developer as tainted forever.
Given a proprietary program, it is accountable to the supplier and you
have no other option. If there is a bug, all you can do is hope for a
patch. If there is a deliberate backdoor, all you can do is hope that
someone will spots if it is ever reverse engineered.
In other words:
  - Open Source: "trust, but verify"
  - Proprietary: "trust, and have faith in the supplier"
Given the current Snowden climate, you would be naive to choose a
proprietary option. Prove me wrong.

Which was mostly security theatre anyway e.g. IIRC the link to download
the different versions of Netscape (i.e. strong vs weak crypto builds)
were right next to each other on the download page. In other words you
had to trust that someone living in Iran or North Korea agreed with US
export law and was going to only ever click on the weaker download link.

And this is taken advantage of every day by phishing attacks. However
although your solution of setting up DNSSEC and DANE is the _correct_
solution, it's just too complex and hard to get right for a lot of
system admins so it's not going to get uptake - just look at how PGP is
also the _correct solution_ for encrypting messages and yet has not had
the uptake since 1991!
I think a better solution would be something like implementing Digest
Authentication (RFC 2069, but replacing MD5 with something like AES-256
and allow it to be upgradable) in the browser. The password field value
would then be replaced with the value from the DA call and no secrets
would be leaked. This solution would get way faster adoption.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Cryptography, backdoors and the Second Amendment 
After the Apple encryption announcement, we had the usual pundits bring
up the Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse [1]:
  "Attorney General Eric Holder, the US top law enforcement official,
  said it is "worrisome" that tech companies are providing default
  encryption on consumer electronics. Locking the authorities out of
  being able to physically access the contents of devices puts children
  at risk, he said.
  ...
  Holder said he wants a backdoor to defeat encryption. He urged the
  tech sector "to work with us to ensure that law enforcement retains
  the ability, with court-authorization, to lawfully obtain information
  in the course of an investigation, such as catching kidnappers and
  sexual predators."
After reading Keybase cofounder Chris Coyne's response to the backdoor
nonsense, it got me thinking about cryptography and the Second
  "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free
  state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
  infringed."
As the US State Department classifies cryptography as a munition,
shouldn't the use of cryptography be protected under the 2nd Amendment?
If so, as the NSA continues its concerted effort to cripple encryption
by providers [3] [4], shouldn't this be seen as the equivalent of the
Department of Justice colluding with Smith & Wesson to manufacture guns
that don't shoot straight and bullets that don't fire?

Citation needed.
Clean-sheet? No. Chrome and Chromium for a long time used WebKit as the
rendering engine.
Have a look at what Mozilla is doing. They developed a new language
called Rust which has a focus on safety, and are using it to build a new
rendering engine called Servo.
It's not that the specifications are too hard, it's more that complexity
in general is hard to manage. And with Firefox having over 12 million
lines of code with over 3000 contributors, you're now applying Brooks'
Law at absurd levels.
I'd put this into the paranoia basket.

    Some academics are set to become much more familiar with the

    2007 pact with the US and UK over defence trade.
    Until recently, DECO only regulated physically exported weapons and
    so-called "dual use" items such as encryption, computing hardware
    and biological matter.
    However in March the act was updated to include "intangible supply",
    which is intended to prohibit the transfer of knowledge from
    Australia that could be used to produce weapons."
