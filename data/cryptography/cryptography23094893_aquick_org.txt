@_subject: Why Blockbuster looks at your ID. 
Haven't we been saying this for years?
The standard argument I hear against it is "the people who would have
to pay for the very large initial investment have no economic
incentive to do so". They obviously don't think they have a long-term
need to do so now, and in the short term, this only replaces fraud
costs (a relatively known entity) with infrastructure costs (a
completely unknown one).
I don't see it happening. This is the same industry that convinced
people it was a good idea to give out their ATM pin number to make
purchases with a debit card... for what exactly?
I think that you made the explicit point of talking about replacing
the credit card infrastructure, when what you really meant was
replacing the credit card companies with others that would make more
rational business decisions in favor of consumer security and privacy.

As I understand it, the merchants bear the entire cost of fraud - the
banks bear almost none - and thus the consumers end up paying for it
indirectly through higher prices. The merchants, however, have very
little control over the infrastructure, which is provided by the
banks, who have little incentive to actually control fraud because
they would bear all of the costs of such, and none of the risk is
So the assertion is that consumers and banks have little incentive to
cooperate with such a system, but (some of***) the merchants REALLY
WANT it. However, the system is useless if the consumers don't have
it, and the banks have no incentive to give something to consumers
that's better, because it would cost them money and save them money
that they can currently simply charge the merchants for (fraud).
*** The merchants can be divided into two groups - most of them who
    have not been bitten by fraud and will continue to try to pay as
    little as possible for credit processing services regardless of
    the risk because every little bit eats more into their profit, and
    those who have been bitten by fraud, understand the risks, and
    will go for paying for for a service that frees them from
    additional liability.
Consumers, on the other hand, still have limited incentive to
participate. I'd suspect the NewBanks(TM) would simply have to lure
them with lower interest rates, which they'd find hard to do because
it would cut into their profits, making it difficult to pay for all of
the additional infrastructure they'd need to build.
The system is, of course, pretty much worthless if it's not in the
hands of the vast majority of consumers.
As I said, any sea change like this has to either replace the
traditional credit granting/honoring agencies, or take away enough of
their business that they have no choice but to go along with
it. Assuming that they don't use their considerable existing wealth
and influence to simply make the new products illegal from the get go.

Trust is not quite the opposite of security (in the sense of an

exclusive. If you have trust, you have no need for security.
Personally, given the choice, I'd rather have trust. I think that this
is a distinction that could be made more often when deciding on how to
implement a security system.

Without seeing all of the expense (and likely inability) of securing
and ensuring the proper count from the machine, people look at the
problem and go "computers are good at counting things fast and people
aren't, so it must therefore be massively cheaper to have a computer
do the count".
If you're >just< talking about summing a few lists, that's true. But
of course, no one who doesn't work for a voting machine company is
just talking about summing a few lists.
The idea that after you factor in everything, it might actually be
cheaper to have people do it after all, is a very difficult one for
many people to even conceptualize. "Progress" demands that computers
do all menial tasks.

I didn't see Ben forward this himself, but it's definitely relevant to
the discussion of malware hiding in hardware:
"Without needlessly boring everyone with the various steps allow me to
share an interesting observation: drivers often assume the hardware is
misbehaved but never malicious. It is fascinating to discover what can
be done by making the hardware malicious.
3) from 1 & 2 above, after about two years, I've reached my goal of
   writing a totally transparent firewall bypass engine for those
   firewalls which are PC-based: you simply overwrite the firmware in
   both NICs and then perform PCI-to-PCI transfers between the two
   cards for suitably formatted IP packets (modern NICs have IP
   "offload engines" in hardware and therefore can trigger on incoming
   and outgoing packets). The "Jedi Packet Trick" (sorry, couldn't
   resist) fools, amongst others, CheckPoint FW-1, Linux-based
   Strongwall, etc. This is of course obvious as none of them check
   PCI-to-PCI transfers,
4) I have extended the technique to provide VM escape support: one
   writes packets from a bridged guest into the network which
   initiates the NIC firmware update, updates the firmware and then
   the NIC firmware is used to inject code into the underlying VM
   host. The requirement to write to the network is then dropped as
   all that is required is the pivoting in the NIC firmware.

The privacy issues are troubling, of course, but it would seem trivial
to bypass this sort of compulsion by having the disk encryption
software allow multiple passwords, each of which unlocks a different
version of the encrypted partition.
When compelled to give out your password, you give out the one that
unlocks the partition full of kitten and puppy pictures, and who's to
say that's not all there is on the drive?
Is there any disk encryption software for which this is common

@_subject: Judge orders defendant to decrypt PGP-protected laptop 
I don't see how it would be reasonably obvious, especially if lots of
disk encryption packages started offering multiple partitions as a
transparent option. All you'd see is a bunch of random bits on the
disk and a password prompt.
They ask you for the password, you put up a fight, and then ultimately
relent and give it to them when they insist.
I don't see how you could tell the difference between a virtual 40GB
encrypted padded partition and 2 virtual 20GB ones. Many virtual disk
implementations will pre-allocate the space. Is there some reason why
filling the empty space with random garbage wouldn't mask the fact
that there were actually multiple partitions in there? There's no law
that says your empty disk space has to actually be empty. (Yet.)
I think we're talking about a straight data storage partition here. It
doesn't seem to hard to have something touch random files on a regular
basis. Regardless, that seems like a weak complaint - all you have to
do is log into the other partition once a week and use it to browse
cuteoverload or something. But, most importantly, you haven't given a good reason not to offer
this as a standard option. Maybe it wouldn't work, but maybe it

I'm looking for a best practices guide (for a system architecture) or
case studies for how best to handle storing and using 3rd party
Specifically, I'm interested in the case where a program or service
needs to store a password in such a way that it can be used (presented
to another service on behalf of the user), which precludes using a
hash or other obfuscated password. Obviously this is a security risk,
but I'm looking for ways to minimize that risk, and tips on how to
design a system that can use those passwords as it needs to but still
minimize the chances of passwords being compromised.
(I understand that storing passwords is not in itself a great idea,
but in practice it's still required to access some web services where
OAuth or the like is not yet supported.)

I would amend this to say "which requires that users make _any_
security decisions".
It's useful to have users confirm their intentions, or notify the user
that a potentially dangerous action is being taken. It is not useful
to ask them to know (or more likely guess, or even more likely ignore)
whether any particular action will be harmful or not.

Apropos the theses thread, this article contains mention of an
interesting security "feature":
'Although the GSM specifications say that a phone should pop up a
warning when it connects to a station that does not have encryption,
SIM cards disable that setting so that alerts are not displayed'
That would be an example of a bad security tradeoff with the intended
result of not bugging the user about something over which they have
neither control nor recourse, but with the actual result of opening a
significant security hole. The incentives are also all misaligned
here. Presumably the right thing to do is refuse to connect to any
unencrypted towers, but assuming that there are some legitimate ones
out in the wild, the net effect is probably just worse service for the
end user. The user has no way to tell the difference, which is of
course the point of using encryption in the first place.
