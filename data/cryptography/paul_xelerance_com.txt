If that was a major issue, then SSL would have been much more successful
then it has been.
I have good hopes that soon we'll see use of our new biggest cryptographically
signed distributed database. And part of the signalling can come in via the
AD bit in DNSSEC (eg by adding an EDNS option to ask for special additional
records signifying "SHOULD do crypto with this pubkey")
The AD bit might be a crude signal, but it's fairly easy to implement at
the application level. Requesting specific additional records will remove
the need for another latency driven DNS lookup to get more crypto information.
And obsolete the broken CA model while gaining improved support for SSL certs
by removing all those enduser warnings.

"The default mode for any internet communication is encrypted"
I never claimed IPsec was more successful....It was not.
Let's first focus on foiling the grand scale of things by protecting
against passive attacks of large scale monitoring. Then let's worry
about protecting against active targetted attacks.
Yes, but in some the API is pretty much done. If you trust your (local)
resolver, the one bit is the only thing you need to check. You let the
resolver do most of the bootstrap crypto. One you have that, your app
can rip out most of the X.509 nonsense and use the public key obtained
from DNS for its further crypto needs.
But by now, upgrades happen more automatic and more quickly. Adding something
new to DNS won't take 10 years to get deployed. We've come a long way. It's
time to reap the benefits from our new infrastructure.

Both xen and kvm do not do this currently. It is problematic for servers.

Note that this is because they take into consideration that secrets have
to be unbreakable for decade(s), which is not the case for all uses of
RSA. For example in DNSSEC, a key can be rolled in a matter of hours
or days.

Currently, the IETF keyassure WG is working on specifying how to use DNS(SEC)
to put the certs in the DNS to avoid the entire CA authentication.
It seems to be deciding on certs (not raw keys/hashes) to simplify and re-use
the existing TLS based implementations (eg HTTPS)

@_subject: Intel to also add RNG 
I love how they pretend to be the first ones with this, totally ignoring others
who have had this for years, such as the VIA PadLock.
The article lists NIST having done tests, but does not mention any CPU model where
this is on. Anyone knows?

So you can do HWRNG -> SWRNG -> Fips ?
Which is what you should do anyway, in case of a hardware failure. I
know the Linux intel-rng and amd-rng used to produce nice series of
zeros. The padlock rng has never produced warnings piping it through
With every phone doing crypto these days, I'd think you are wrong. Also,
the VIA PadLock already ships with an HWRNG on die. It's been shipping
for years.

@_subject: SHA256 reduced to 112 bits? 
I've heard rumors of an attack on the SHA-2 family reducing complexity of SHA256 to something less or equal of 112 bits.
This attack will apparently be announced in a few days - perhaps at Black Hat or
Def Con?
I would be interested in knowing more.

@_subject: Persisting /dev/random state across reboots 
"better then not".
A lot of (pseudo)random comes from disk or network interrupts. These are often
similar during stock system startup. It is even more important if there is no
harddisk but flashdisk, which is not contribting to entropy of the system. This
was a big issue for "openwrt" (a Linux on Linksys routers) which booted so
similarly every time that there was not enough random left at all.
By saving the entropy from a longer run system at shutdown, you increase the
entropy of the next boot by adding randomness from the previous state(s)

@_subject: Disk encryption advice... 
Use a VM based solution where the Windows images are stored on a NAS
that uses disk encryption (and requires an admin when it would reboot), yet
the Windows based VM's would need no disk encryption supported whatsoever.
My laptop for instance is running Fedora with whole disk encryption, and I
run various Windows VM's that have their image stored on that encrypted disk.

I'm sure its nothing compared to the 3 layers of url shorter redirects and
their latency :P
You mean it will be harder for MITM attacks on SSL. Isn't that a good thing? :P
The SSL everywhere problem has been a political one, not a technical one.
I am sure the "free market" can deal with putting SSL everywhere, if that
expectation has come from every internet user - instead of that internet
user clicking away many warnings about self signed certs, redirects and
SSL man-in-the-middle "protection".
