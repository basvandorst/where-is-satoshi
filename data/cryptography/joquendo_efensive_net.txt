@_subject: [Cryptography] So please tell me. Why is my solution wrong? 
Show user a picture of a violin where their keyword is
99.9999% likely to be (drumroll) violon. Or a picture of
a monkey where the keyword will be? Would be more effective
if they allowed the user to upload something arbitrary.
Then again, my first guess at seeing a picture of Marilyn
Monroe would be Marilyn. My gripes with giving the user too much control over these
aspects is that it's often the user that dumbs down the
technology. E.g., using the password: "p4ssw0rd" and then
a 2FA PIN on 1111 or 1234. Would benefit organizations to
give their clients a "5-10 minute video" explaining the
need, and the benefit for security so users can understand
it versus thinking adding another breakable layer of
security will aide. E.g., so what you're giving them a
picture. I have a keystroke logger. Now what?
