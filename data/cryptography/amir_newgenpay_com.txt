@_subject: GESG Identity-Based Public Key Cryptography (ID-PKC) 
ID based public key is not a new concept, I believe first proposed by Adi
Shamir in Crypto 84 (the first I attended :-). It's a cute concept, but I'm
skeptic about its practical value - except of course as a way to force
parties to use private keys known to authorities :-(
The security requirement of ID based PKC is challanging, even more than
`regular` PKC (which is obviously a special case). So there were many works
proposing systems and also many attacks - although recently there are some
proposals with proofs of security (with strong assumptions...), e.g. Boneh &
Franklin in upcoming Crypto, see
 But, what is the practical value of ID based systems? Not sending the public
key? Give me a break... In what scenarios exactly? Many PKI scenarios are not ID specific at all -
ID is just one way to establish trust... And even when people use IDs, why
assume everybody trusts (completely!) the same authority?
Best, Amir

@_subject: move to NewGenPay; and, collecting secure e-commerce resources 
Hi all, First, I've recently left IBM as part of the spin-off of our payments
project into NewGenPay. My IBM e-mail was supposed to forward but I think
they've recently cancelled it, so please use my new email. Secondly, I plan to extend further the collection of secure e-commerce
resources I've begun in IBM. I've already put in the demo area of our site
( the old stuff - my lectures and overviews of different
areas of secure e-commerce, secure payments, and applied cryptography. It
includes a few links but I'll like to expand that much more to make it a
useful community resource. While almost all that we currently have is `sold` with our `demo money`, the
new parts will mostly be regular links, of course I'll leave a bit of our
`per-fee links` so people have motivation to use our demo... (but we had
thousands of people doing it Ok - it's very easy). I'll appreciate, therefore, suggestions of useful technical and educational
resources that I should include there. Examples are lectures and courses
available online, archives, standards, forums, etc. I won't try to cover
purely commercial sites or in general any non-technical/educational sites.
BTW, if some of you have relevant lectures/tutorials/overviews in relevant
areas that you prefer we'll put in out site (e.g. it is difficult for you to
host them), I'll be happy to host a reasonable number of well written
resources. Best regards, Amir Herzberg

Eugene said, of It is not necessarily the end of free e-mail; a bearable restriction is
sufficient. Specifically, e-mail readers and servers will be configured to send a polite
refusal to any non-paid e-mail from an unknown source. This means that your
_first_ e-mail to people using such a filter-by-charging solution will
require a small payment. Assuming they consider you a non-spammer, they
should return the payment to you (or simply not deposit it). This takes care reasonably well of peer to peer e-mail (I think), and can be
easily deployed (any volunteers? I'll be very glad to provide our system for
this !). As to mailing lists like this one... Here one solution is manual
moderating, of course. But for a fully automated list... maybe a charge per
posting which is proportional to the number of subscribers (well, like an
ad, I guess). Best regards, Amir Herzberg

Peter said, That's good! Nobody forces people to send junk (e)mail. It should cost them
something. Some people may contribute this automatically to charity, others
may keep it, others yet may use a mail service provider who will keep it (or
part of it). People who send unsolicited (e)mail should pay for it - so they
think twice before sending to all of your e-mail addresses!

Ben responded to me thus:

You can certainly deploy our system, as well as several others, e.g. one
response mentioned correctly MojoNation (of course there are plenty of
reasons to choose ours :-). I was puzzled by your saying `without everyone else in the world also
deploying it`. I thought you meant that you are concerned that others will
use it, making your deployment redundant or not commercial etc. Now when
writing this to you I realize I stupidly misunderstood you. What you meant,
I'm quite sure now, if that you are concerned that if you implement such a
payment solutions others will not be able to mail you since they don't have
it. Now that's a very valid concern and I also thought for a long time it
may be a show stopper. But now I actually think it could work. Let me explain how. The key is the
belief that micropayment systems MUST emerge - and be interoperable. That is
a payer with account at one Payment Service Provider (PSP) should be able to
pay anybody with account at any PSP. That's certainly our goal - our system
has this property and we plan to work closely with any other vendor which
will want to have this property to ensure interoperability. Assuming this, the problem is only the bootstapping phase, before everybody
has accounts in interoperable PSPs. But in that phase when the system is not
yet so widely used, it will be sufficient to force the sender to simply do
some manual process - such as enter a web site to open a demo account and
pay. That's clearly something achievable with our system or others. If it
becomes popular, spammers may develop automated tools to do so as well, but
that will buy them very little as at that point the system will be popular
enough to move to real payments. BTW, I've been thinking of payments as the answer to spamming already for
many years, and in fact it was one of my motivations for working on
micropayments (from which our broader payment platform emerged). There are others who thought of it long ago, in
particular Kevin Mccurly (see
 Another BTW, the other application I really want micropayments for (and was
my first motivation to this if I recall correctly) is also crypto-related...
it is to motivate people to produce reviews of products, services, and esp.
other reviewers - creating a huge `web` (or directed graph) of credentials.
If these are signed, and identify the reviewed entity by its public key,
these credentials are certificates. Using such a collection of many
credentials is what I believe will be the ultimate solution to public key
infrastructure - and this is another area I'm very interested in (and worked
on). Best regards, Amir Herzberg

James E. Donald said, No, actually, the trust management decision becomes very decentralized. The similarity seems to be only that both are not relying on identity
certificates. But otherwise it's quite a different approach. In our system,
we establish trust by building a graph from available certificates and other
credentials of different entities in the network, and rules for assigning
roles to secret-key holders based on their certificates/credentials and the
role of the issuers of each. This raises a non-trivial, but feasible,
computational problem, resulting in assigning roles to the requestor (as
well as to all the issuers of certificates/credentials of the requestor). I'm not involved now in this effort but the project is still ongoing and you
can even download and try out the system. Best regards, Amir Herzberg

@_subject: Forward Security Question 
Seems that RFC 2828 only clarifies that not all people agree on a
definition. Let me try to clarify, and since I'm just about to complete
the lecture and chapter covering this area in my `secure communication
and commerce` course (and book), I'll really appreciate
comments/corrections. In particular I hope Robert Shirey (editor of
rfc2828) is listening  (I don't have his e-mail).  First to the specific questions in the original note: No. The concepts covering this are `resilience to known-key attack`
(when K is a session key derived from long-term `master` key(s)), and
`proactive security` (when K denotes all secret & keying info). I think I didn't understand this as this appears impossible trivially. Bingo! :-)
A reasonable definition for PFS appears in [MOV96], def. 12.16, p. 496
in my copy. Let me give here a slight variant (improvement I hope) to
A protocol is said to have perfect forward secrecy if compromise of
long-term keys at time t does not compromise PAST traffic, i.e. messages
sent before t-T, even if attacker has all past (encrypted) traffic
available. The value T is a constant (the length of key update period). Some related definitions/concepts:
Known-key attack: this is an attack on a protocol which uses designated,
multiple `session keys` to encrypt and/or authenticate messages, where
all the `session keys` are exchanged using some other secrets (master,
long-term keys) never used directly to encrypt or authenticate messages.
The attacker is given the value of some session keys. A protocol is
resilient to knonw key attack if an attacker with access to all traffic
and to some session keys cannot decrypt messages encrypted with a key
not given to him, and cannot authenticate messages using a key not given
to him. Proactive security recovery: Consider the following scenario. Attacker
compromises all keys of a party at time t (without the party being aware
of it). A protocol provides proactive security recovery with period T if
at t+T, either the attack is detected or security is restored (attacker
cannot decrypt or forge future traffic). See formal definition and
implementation in [CHH00]. Best regards, Amir Herzberg

@_subject: The tragedy in NYC 
Perry said, I agree that there shouldn't be laws limiting crypto research and usage. But
not since `I'd rather die than lose my freedom to use crypto`, which I think
is a reasonable summary of Perry's argument. Most people will not agree; in
fact, most people are willing to expose their privacy to receive low-value
promotions or discount. They will not be willing to risk their lives for
this. In fact, if giving up crytpto completely would help substantially to protect
against terror, I'll support it myself. But...
The real argument is simple: there is no evidence or convincing argument why
shutting down crypto will substantially help defend against terrorism. It is
a popular, easy solution, good for politicians as it is an easy `sell` to
the public, but not effective. That's why we should defend against it; the
negligible help it may provide to law-enforcement is not worth its cost in
loss of privacy and commerce, in the loss of freedom, and in the dangers of
abuse by government. Best, Amir Herzberg

@_subject: Which internet services were used? (Home of the Brave) 
Perry replied to Eric: I think Perry makes a good case for Automobiles. But why ignore the
airplanes? This crime would be impossible if there were no civilian
airplanes allowed. If necessary, the airforce could provide flight services.
Of course, passangers must be chained, as standard precaution; this is only
a minor inconvinience, well worth the improved security, as the crew will
only be to happy to help passangers relieve themselves, with reasonable if
not perfect privacy. Another advantage of preventing air traffic (and preferably also cars, as
Perry already argued), would be to make contact between terrorists via face
to face meeting more difficult. By forcing people to communicate
electronically, and without (legal) encryption, we can substantially reduce
the percentage of successful attacks (there are some critics who may claim
it may increase the number of terrorists, but we can always ignore these). One last suggestion: the special aircrafts as well as the chains will be
decorated with American heritage, to show America will not give in so
easily, e.g. `Welcome to America, Home of the Brave`. I must however disagree with Perry's ending comments:
What do you mean `ban it`? Definitely, US forces should _eliminate_ all
these dangerous weapons, by searching libraries worldwide. We expect every
freedom-loving nation to help, but it may be that we'll need to use force
with some countries. There is always the danger of some copies made, but
that's pretty easy to prevent; copy and press machines have been abused by
terrorists for centuries and it is high time to control their use. We still
have the technology to do so; let's use it now, then we can get rid of these
dangerous computer science departments.  Best, Amir Herzberg

Hadmut replied to Jim:
Correct, but let me explain _why_. Suppose by law, everybody can use GAK encryption alg, say `GEEK`. Attacker
wishes to use non-GAK algorithm, say `TRICK`. GEEK has a distinguisher
module available to NSA which outputs GEEK or SUSPECT for encrypted data
(using GEEK or any other algorithm, respectively). Attacker encrypts his data with TRICK and then with GEEK. So this is validly
GEEK encrypted data. Until the NSA tries to decipher it, it looks fine. (As far as I know, sending this message is still legal. I definitely hope
