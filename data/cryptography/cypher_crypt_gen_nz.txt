Just 3 years ago I was looking at a portal site for airline pilots. They
had a password field to get in which was all well and good, but there was
a "hint" link for those who had forgotten the password. And on the hint
page it said :
  "The site password is the same four digits as the combination
  lock on the door of the crew locker room at the airport."
So a few lines of perl and an average of 5,000 hits gets you into the site
and into secure areas at the airport. I'm hoping the site has gone by now.
