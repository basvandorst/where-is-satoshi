@_subject: [Cryptography] AES-256- More NIST-y? paranoia 
Le 7 oct. 2013 ? 17:45, Arnold Reinhold  a ?crit :
You should take a look a this algorithm : - The block size is variable and unknown from an attacker.
- The size of the key has no limit and is unknown from an attacker.
- The key size does not affect the algorithm speed (using a 256 bit key is the same as using a 1024 bit key).
- The algorithm is much faster than the average cryptographic function. Experimental test showed 600 Mo/s - 4 cycles/byte on an Intel Core 2 Duo P8600 2.40GHz and 1,2 Go/s - 2 cycles/byte on an Intel i5-3210M 2.50GHz. Both CPU had only 2 cores.

@_subject: [Cryptography]  Laws and cryptography 
Over the past year I was in contact with different cryptographers (I was designing a new symmetric algorithm) and they all told me in order to publish it no governmental authorization was needed. They also told me that they publish paper all the time without having an authorization.
However there is the Wassenaar Arrangement between US, Europe and other countries that regulate the export and use of cryptography (
The Article 3 of the chapter 2 of the european law says : An authorisation shall be required for the export of the dual-use items listed in Annex I (
What they consider dual-use items is A ??symmetric algorithm?? employing a key length in excess of 56 bits (
The department of the ministry of defense that handle this regulation can't answer if publishing a cryptographic algorithm needs an authorization. However the Wassenaar Arrangement clearly says that material, software and technology need an authorization to be exported / published.
What is actually the status of the law about cryptography and publishing new algorithms ? Is the cryptographer that publish a paper without governmental authorization an outlaw ?

@_subject: [Cryptography] Steganography and bringing encryption to a piece of 
last year I designed a new encryption algorithm (
 based on transposition rather than
substitution. The idea behind this algorithm is like cutting every letter
of a whole book and shuffling them together. The result is so big and mixed
up that it is possible to recreate a completely different book from it. The
algorithm generates from a password a relation between two sets,
associating uniquely each element in one set to the other one.
The proprieties of this algorithm allow to use it for a lot of other things
than cryptography. When a dictionary (a list of all the English words) is
used as set, it is possible to securely replace a word from a plaintext
with another one from the dictionary (with the condition of the plaintext
word being in the dictionary). This idea led me to design a steganography
technology and last week I released a demo of it at: Encrypting the phrase "*This is a test.*" with the password "*mypassword*"
would result in a ciphertext like "*uncomplimentary threateningly.
conceptually secures on pockiest.*". This technology has principally two
advantage :
- Since the ciphertext is made of words it attracts far less attention.
- The ciphertext can be sent by other mean than electronic communication
simply by written it down on a paper, making it a lot harder to track.
This is an alpha version, there is a lot to improve but if people are
interested by this technology we can do some nice things with it.
What do you think ?

Thank you that the kind of feedback I need. This is an alpha version, there
is a lot of work ahead. Since the implementation of the algorithm is a
little different than encrypting bytes, I didn't use a security mechanism
for differential attacks that was present on the paper. I just added it and
now this problem is resolved.

Steganography has been around for a long time but the problem with these
techniques is that they are easily defeated. The objective with Steno.io is
to bring the robustness of an electronic encryption algorithm to paper.
Steganography on a piece of paper? A problem with the dictionary approach
Yes this is a problem I am working on. I have some ideas how to solve it
but nothing very effective right now. Any suggestions are welcome.

The meaning needs to be altered if we want to hide a message. I was
thinking about extracting a phrase from internet (or a database) that
contain a ciphertext word and use it in the final encrypted message. This
will allow to maintain a coherence between the words. The downsides are :
- You need to send the ciphertext words over the internet to look for
phrases, someone can intercept them. Using a database require a lot of
information and storage. It may not be practical.
- The final message will contain a phrase for every ciphertext word, it's
very long.
I don't think this idea will work.

Thanks I will check it out.

The Voynich manuscript is a very interesting mystery. Unfortunately since
it hasn't been broken yet, everything is suppositions. William Friedman had
the same idea, he thought it was a kind of synthetic universal language.
Your comment illustrate very well that a cipher needs to be practical. If
you need to spend years learning how to encrypt and decrypt with it, its
utilisation will be very complicated. Another example is a code book with
the famous Beale ciphers. It is very hard to decipher but not as practical
as having a password to remember.

I just had an idea that I wanted to share. I don't know if it's a bad idea
or a good idea but having another vision of the problem always help. My
objective is to improve things. If you have any suggestion how to
ameliorate the steganography technology or the cryptography algorithm
behind it, it will be very helpful.
