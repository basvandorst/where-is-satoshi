@_subject: TLS break 
I had a hard time with this, too, but this PDF really clarified it for Let me try a "layman's" explanation (assuming I have it right)
We start assuming the attacker can to hijack or MITM the victim's TCP The attacker opens *its*own* TLS connection to the server [so that is now being encrypted by a symmetric key the attacker picked] and sticks some data into the pipe.
The victim wants a TLS connection and so begins negotiating one.  The attacker just MITM's that as a *renegotiation* with the server for its TLS connection.  (that is, the victim thinks they're negotiating a NEW TLS connection, but the attacker proxies that into a *renegotation* on the existing TLS connection).  In short order the attacker is frozen out of the connection [since it will then be encrypted by a key picked by the victim], BUT: the victim's data will ride over the TLS connection that the attacker had previously set up and pre-loaded with some data, and so the victim's data *FOLLOWS* the attacker's -- the attacker was able to inject arbitrary data *in*front* of the victim's data.
As I understand it, this is only really a vulnerability in situations where a command to do something *precedes* the authentication to enable the command.  The obvious place where this happens, of course, is with HTTPS where the command [GET or POST] comes first and the authentication [be it a cookie or form vbls] comes later.

... used in court:
I think you're not getting the trick here: with truecrypt's plausible deniability hack you *CAN* give them the password and they *CAN* decrypt the file [or filesystem].  BUT: it is a double encryption setup.  If you use one password only some of it gets decrypted, if you use the other password all of it is decrypted.  There's no way to tell if you used the first password that you didn't decrypt everything.  So in theory you could hide the nasty stuff behind the second passsword, a ton of innocent stuff behind the first password and just give them the first password when asked.  In practice, I dunno if it really works or will really let you slide by.

Well, as I understood it, a key part of the auth that wasn't mentioned was the source telephone  and so lost-in-the-mail/theft would, on top of guessing the trivial questions, also have to call from your home phone [or the phone "associated" with the account].  Not perfectly secure but I was under the impression that ANI was harder to spoof than CallerID is.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Books on modern cryptanalysis 
The recent flood of discussions has touched on many modern attacks on cryptosystems.   I'm long out of the crypto world [I last had a crypto clearance *before* differential cryptanalysys was public info!].  Attacks that leak a bit at a time strike me as amazing.  I remember reading about attacks that involved running chips at lower voltage than they were supposed to have and that somehow allowed them to be compromised, etc.
Anyhow, are there any (not *too* technical) books on the modern techniques for attacking cryptosystems?
  Thanks.   /bernie\

@_subject: [Cryptography] Is Apple correct? 
I don't think we can/do know that.  If it has an IMEI hard coded into it, what would prevent a hacker/government who obtained a copy of it from hard coding a different IMEI into it [or making it IMEI agnostic On the theory that only the FBI (and a few people at Apple) knows the IMEI of the affected phone, it is possible they could construct a patch and encrypt it using the IMEI as the key.  That *might* prevent hackers [and other governments] from using it on other phones [but not the FBI: since they know the target IMEI, *they* could decrypt the patch and we're back where we started with a potential back door leaking out].
So I think it'll be very hard to make this a really secure security-breach [is that an oxymoron?? :o)].

That's a great read!   I you really care about Linear B, try to find a copy of "The Decipherment of Linear B" by John Chadwick.   Wow... it has just been reissued and is available as a Kindle book!
