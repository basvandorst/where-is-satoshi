@_subject: [Cryptography] Does this keying scheme make sense? 
encrypts files in cloud storage with each file
having a different key.  The keys are all generated from a secret
keystore seed in a way that is supposed to be secure
This sounds almost exactly like Amazon"s server side encryption for S3
safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly
rotates. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block
ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to
encrypt your data.
