Mathematicians have a precise definition of what a proof is, thanks to
logicians like David Hilbert and Kurt Goedel. But people in all
disciplines have a terrible time formulating problems, and remembering
the conditions under which a statement was proved. They also quote
theorems incorrectly, and errors propagate through the less
well-reviewed parts of the literature.
