Basically the bad guys have more computers than the good guys ! (some of
    which they have stolen, but spam is lucrative enough that they can
    afford to buy them anyway -- so all you will ever do is to freeze out
    low profit-margin spam).
There is a huge amount of low profit-margin spam.
However a better system would be pay to send, be paid to receive.
earn.com does exactly that already and it is based on Bitcoin.
