I think this is probably the best general approach to keeping devices
that shouldn't connect to the Internet away from the Internet. Start
by shutting off access for all devices by configuring your router to
use a whitelist-only approach and clear the whitelist. Then add one

firewall configuration policy that should work well for most
households. Unfortunately, the vast majority of users tend to think
about security until they've been hacked.
