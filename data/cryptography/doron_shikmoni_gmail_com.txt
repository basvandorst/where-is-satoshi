In a way, even some USB sticks had.
The U3 <> stick variety created by a few USB stick
vendors a few years back (e.g. the Sandisk Cruzer Micro), would present a
CD drive with executable code, in addition to the mass storage device, in
order to have autorun kicked off on Windows (so that the U3 "launchpad"
would launch automatically and transparently...).
Shortly thereafter, Sandisk released a firmware mod tool, that would
disable the logical CD device completely.
There's also an open source tool that can do same, or can even conveniently
replace the CD image with one of your liking.

Yes, they did offer crypto there too, iirc.
Though it was a software tool (guess for which OS), not part of that

A data point:
The 7.2 binary file is signed (Autheticode) by TrueCrypt Foundation.
In comparison with the signature on the 7.1a binary:
- Same CA entity (GlobalSign).
- Different certificate (the one used for 7.1a has already expired).
- Certificate for 7.2 is valid from Aug 2012 (i.e. not recent), thru Aug
- Different key (also 4096 vs. 2048)
- Object signed ?27 ?May, ?2014 19:45:19 (Symantec time stamping)
