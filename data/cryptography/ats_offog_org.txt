That's pretty similar to the Lenslok copy protection system used by a
bunch of games in the early 1980s:
  (Lenslok used a strip of prisms rather than just a mask, but it's
otherwise identical.)
It was generally thought to be a horrible idea at the time, but
presumably it's a bit easier to make it scale properly now...

The other "big" implementation is Mozilla's NSS library, which has
certainly had fewer CVEs published than the other two:
... although that may just reflect the much smaller number of
applications that use it. It's also written in C and uses the same kinds
of implementation patterns as OpenSSL/GnuTLS.
There's been some effort within Fedora to standardise on NSS, including
an OpenSSL-compatible API wrapper (nss_compat_ossl):

There's TICOM report I-186, "Interrogation of Oberpostrat Kurt
Vetterlein on attempted tapping of trans-atlantic cables", from December
1945. This is available from Christos Triantafyllopoulos' archive:
The report says:
"Abteilung VIII had conducted some experiments in the finding and
tapping of cables in the Baltic Sea. As a result of the experiments, it
was assumed that outgoing cable telegrams could be successfully
intercepted 50km. from the shore. [...]
No actual cases of the tapping of long-distance cables were known to
Vetterlein. He was told that it was planned to find the cables to
America [...] and if possible to tap and intercept them or destroy
them. This was to be done by dropping from a submarine a coil, which
could be used both for finding and interception [...] near to the
[...] He had also heard that the German Navy worked on the tapping of
foreign cables, but could offer no information or names connected with
So the Germans certainly developed and tested a way of doing this, and
intended to do it, but it's not clear whether they actually did it.
Christos' blog has lots of good discussion of WW2 German cryptanalysis

The encoding scheme you're suggesting is fairly reminiscent of Dan
Bernstein's CurveCP keys-in-domain-names design:

You probably want a library that talks the DBus "Secret Service"

This probably depends on where you are in the world. In the UK, we've
had "Economy 7" electricity meters available since the early 1980s that
can switch off-peak loads (e.g. electric storage heating) based on a
control signal transmitted over longwave radio. The traditional approach
was to use an external contactor for switching, but you can now get
integrated meters with everything in one box for domestic applications.
It's well-tested technology here, not terribly expensive, and absolutely
something that the UK specs for smart meters expect you to support. This
2011 document from the Smart Metering Design Group shows some of the
possible arrangements:
