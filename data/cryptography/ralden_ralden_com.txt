Can a (competently collected and analyzed) sample of DNA be viewed as a "really high quality" biometric?
I get it that biometrics cannot be secrets; but it would seem that DNA might be (theoretically) the gold standard for establishment of identity. Analysis of DNA is likely to be, for some long period of time[1], too expensive/slow/invasive to be useful for day-to-day identity applications. But as a "last resort" method of recovering lost secrets it might work.
[1] One can imagine certain medical applications driving the cost of quick DNA sampling down to the point where this prediction is laughable...
