@_subject: MD5 trick 
The trick could be shortly expressed as follows:
"Give me three files and I will give you another three with the
same MD5 hash"
Of course, it is a trick. Yesterday I updated my paper "Tunnels in Hash Functions: MD5 Collisions Within a Minute"
( and MD5 collision program
Now, the average time of MD5 collision is 17 seconds on PC Intel Pentium 4 (3.2 MHz).
I asked Ondrej Mikle to write the program "pack3". Thanks to him, you can find the progrm on
  Usage: pack3 file1 file2 file3 file4 file5 file6 will create two packages, package1.exe and package2.exe. Both will have the same MD5 sum, while package1.exe will extract files 1-3 and package2.exe will extract files 4-6.
It enables attacking SW distribution process for instance. A
department, distributing SW (to clients, web, etc.) could
distribute package2, whilst it is signed by SW developing
department as package1.
The trick is here very easy, because it is the attacker, who
creates colliding packages. A toy scenario: The SW development department sends the source to the distributing
department. It adds a readme or help files and returns the complete
package (package1) to the SW development department. Of course, SW
development department runs package1.exe and checks byte by byte
that the original source files aren?t changed. Now it signs it.
Another one: The third party prepares a contract. The contract is sent to both
buyer (package1) and seller (package2) and signed by both parties. The structure of package1,2 is trivial. The first part is common,
the second part contains colliding blocks and the third part
contains the table of files file1 file2 file3 file4 file5 file6.
Package.exe decompresses file1 file2 file3 or file4 file5 file6
according to a specified bit value in the second part. Because now it is very quick to generate MD5 collision for any
chosen IV, it is possible to write the first part arbitrarily and
then generate a collision. Note that the number of files could be arbitrary and there are more
clever scenarios. The program serves only as a toy example how to
get arround the necessity of creating the second preimage.

@_subject: Tunnels in Hash Functions: MD5 Collisions in 40 seconds 
Congratulations to Marc Stevens, who described a method for fast
collision attack on MD5! Just now (! it is a collision !) I have finished the translation of
my paper Vlastimil Klima: "Tunnels in Hash Functions: MD5 Collisions
Within a Minute". It is based on a new method, tunneling. Using it on MD5 it gives a
collision in 40 seconds on a 3 GHz Pentium 4.  (Actually I used two
times slower notebook with the time about 80 seconds.) I expect the
publication on eprint also, but I will put in on my web together
with the source code of the program in one or two hours. It is

@_subject: Tunnels accelerate MD5 collisions 
Hi all,
according to my paper "Tunnels in Hash Functions: MD5 Collisions
Within a Minute" I programmed tunnels for searching the second
block of MD5 collision message also. In the zero version of the
program I used tunnels only in the first block to demonstrate the
It took 23 seconds, now it takes 1 second. Together with the first
block (optimized from 60 s. to 30 s.) it generates a MD5 collision
per 31 seconds in average (slow notebook Acer, Pentium, 1.6 GHz).
The paper, source code and Windows exe is available on

@_subject: [Cfrg] HMAC-MD5 
I agree with Steven?s "I'd rather avoid HMAC-MD5, just as a matter
of future-proofing". And more.
In am nearly sure that a preimage attack (MD5) will be found in the
next two or three years.

@_subject: [Cfrg] HMAC-MD5 
I think that we have the "evidence". The security MD5 depends
heavily on a lot of nonlinearities in functions F,G,I and on
carries in arithmetic additions. Nonlinearities in F,G,I are
bitwise and very weak. Carries are much stronger, but the collision
attacks showed that it is possible to controll them also. New
differential schemes (paths) could be proposed, new ways of
controlling the interior variables of MD5 could be discovered. It
could lead to the second preimage attacks and maybe further. Vlastimil Klima

@_subject: A new generation of hash functions SNMAC 
We would like to announce:
- A new cryptographic primitive SBC (special block cipher) - A family of hash functions SNMAC as candidates for hash functions of
new generation
The paper "A New Concept of Hash Functions SNMAC Using a Special Block
Cipher and NMAC/HMAC Constructions" was sent to EUROCRYPT 2007. Its
extended version is available as IACR eprint Report 2006/376, We ought to publish concrete instances of SBC (special block cipher DN)
and of SNMAC (hash function HDN) on SNMAC homepage as soon as it will
be possible (waiting for an approval of the publication).
SNMAC homepage: The paper contains also an explanation why we need the new cryptographic
primitive for hash functions. It also describes the procedure, which
led to proposals of SBC and SNMAC. We hope that the new concept will
be discussed.
Vlastimil Klima,
