@_subject: [Cryptography] DSL modems - how would we detect wholesale 
Many DSL modems that I've evaluated are Linux based, and are subject to GPL
requests. I've gotten my hands on a build tarball from a couple of
different vendors which include a cross compiler, GPL source (for the
portion of the code which is not proprietary), compiled Linux kernel (which
contains proprietary drivers), and one or more proprietary binaries which,
from what I can tell, are primarily used to maintain the local
configuration. The result is a firmware which voids your warranty when
uploaded, but works.
Vendors often use the same firmware base, which is typically provided by
the chipset vendor (e.g. Broadcom). There were several modems I could break
root shell on with a shell escape sequence from the telnet/ssh menu.
None of this may be available if you're using an xBell branded modem (or
whoever your telco is). However, if you know a few details about your xDSL
connection (vpi/vci etc.), you could likely purchase your own modem, using
your own generated firmware.
Granted, there are still proprietary software components involved.
Generally xDSL connections do not use a high amount of upstream bandwidth,
unless you've got ADSL2+ Annex M or VDSL2 going on. Your modem, if you have
access, will report the up and down sync rate, which is consistent with the
rate reported by the DSLAM in my experience. To attempt to transmit data
outside of the DSL layer, using frequencies outside of the sync rate is
difficult, would involve cooperation from a lot of different vendors, and
would be a poor used of resources. Compromise of your data would more
likely be handled in software, at layer 3. Placing your modem in bridged
mode, with an open source router behind is a very good idea (as you
