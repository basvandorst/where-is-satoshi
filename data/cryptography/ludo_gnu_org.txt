@_subject: convergent encryption reconsidered 
Sorry for arriving late into this thread...
I don't see how this would work.  It's different from a dictionary
attack because it looks for partial matches, as opposed to exact
Suppose you have one (sensitive) file that contains
"" and another than contains
"".  They have different hashes, hence
different ciphertexts through convergent encryption.  How would one get
access to the plaintext of the former when knowing only the latter?
Now, let's assume that said files were split into two "blocks" before
being convergent-encrypted, namely "" and "" for
the former, and "" and "" for the latter.  The
"confirmation-of-a-file" (or rather "confirmation-of-a-block") attack
does work, but it does not reveal anything about the secret.
I'm not sure about Tahoe, but the scheme I had in mind in my thesis was
to allow anyone to choose whatever encoding is used [0].  This means
that one could choose the algorithm used to split input files into
blocks, whether to compress the input file or individual blocks, what
compression algorithm to use, what hash and cipher algorithm to use,
etc.  With that level of freedom, these two attacks are a lesser threat
(one might argue that, in practice, many people would use the default
settings, which would make them potential victims and attackers of each
