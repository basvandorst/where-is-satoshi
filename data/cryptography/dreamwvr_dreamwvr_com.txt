@_subject: Home 4 Crypto 
How much space is needed to house a home for crypto? Let us know as
we are in the process of setting up CVS on OpenBSD just now. Currently
we have sup working fine it appears. But are still debugging why
cvs checkouts are not working.  b.t.w. we have reliable bandwidth that
could donate for this Security Home.
