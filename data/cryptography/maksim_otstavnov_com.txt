@_subject: Russian Duma Adopts Law On Digital Signatures 
Hello Pawel,
PK> Interesting how laws are passed in the part of world, as Polish digital
PK> signature law was also passed with lots of private businesses being
PK> done in both Parliament and Senate, against advice of the expert
PK> comission created by the Parliament itself (sic!)  and agains the EU
PK> recommendations. So we have the law enacted, but everyone is expecting
PK> that to be changed soon to become usable, and definitely to make it
PK> compliant with EU law.
Are there any translation/comments in English?
