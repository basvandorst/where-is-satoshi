@_subject: What email encryption is actually in use? 
While it may was designed for submission, STARTTLS use in relaying
probably transports more mail -- looking at the past month, of the
82000 mail I received close to 11000 was delivered in encrypted
streams.  7% is quite nice...  I wonder how that compares with the use
of OpenPGP or S/MIME in mail.
