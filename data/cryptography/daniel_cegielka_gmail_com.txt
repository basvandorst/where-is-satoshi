SilentCircle crypto products? I do not think it will be something new.
The questions are more about locked IMEI etc. I don't know how they
will solve the baseband problem (closed-source proprietary chip/RTOS
running alongside e.g. Android).
Crypto is the smallest problem in this project.

What gives you the use of cryptography, if your phone is factory
built-in backdoor (baseband)? Until not solve this problem, you can
not say that Blackphone is really safe.
