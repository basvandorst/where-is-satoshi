@_subject: Testing cryptographic hash functions 
I have put on-line an implementation of an Eric Filiol's Moebius Statistical Analysis of Symmetric Ciphers and Hash Functions, if anyone might need such a It is a part of a package of utilities for testing cryptographic hash functions (Maurer's universal statistical test, (partial) collision searching and avalanche property measurement).
