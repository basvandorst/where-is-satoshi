There's a popular quote floating around that in the future, transacting on the blockchain will be as rare and specialised as chartering an oil tanker. What's annoying is the OP thinks that's a good thing and very few people of note seem to disagree.
Many of us have been warning this outcome was inevitable for years. If transaction fees become too expensive, funds will consolidate on centralised exchanges and only a very small number of "banks" will use to blockchain to settle funds for the rest of us peasants.
This makes possible political control through the regulation of payment layers, censorship, tracking, loss of privacy, seizure of funds, fractional reserve...all the things we want to kill. As Satoshi said, "the main benefits are lost if a trusted party is still required..."
Lightning Network has largely failed thus far to live up to its early promises and timelines, and I can't help but think that in a Bitcoin world, most people will just be using things like PayPal, Square, Alipay, etc, to move and store funds because they will be priced off the blockchain. We already see it happening.
That's just not exciting.
The irony is that in the effort to allow everyone, everywhere, to run a full node (as opposed to what Satoshi intended), developers killed the reason most people would have to run a full node in the first place?to validate their own transactions on-chain.
Didn't Satoshi predict that Bitcoin mining would consolidate into server farms? "It would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware."
You said on BitcoinTalk several years ago that the plan was always to raise the blocksize. Is it still your opinion that it should have been done? Or do you think that even Satoshi's original plans were flawed too?
Thanks for your thoughts. I still wouldn't say it has failed completely, but I can't disagree that it hasn't lived up to much of the early vision.

Here's another view: it was *because* Bitcoin ran into (unnecessary imo)
scaling problems that the block time became a problem for day to day
0-conf was reasonably secure for day-to-day until RBF (which has
its own dubious origins) and more importantly, full-ish blocks. Merchants
could choose how much risk they were willing to accept, and
in most cases, the risk of a successful double spend
on a relatively inexpensive transaction was much lower than the
risk of a credit card chargeback, and the savings on
transaction fees more than made up for double spends on the whole.
Bitcoin doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to be better
than an existing alternative. It was better despite the insistence
of certain early devs that Satoshi was wrong. Compare ten minute
settlement to 60-90 days with credit cards!
chargeoff rate. I believe the risk with 1 or even 0 confirming blocks
will be much less than the rate of chargebacks on verified credit card
There are also business models that could exist to offer added double
spend protection, like insurance to businesses that need it, ie, entrepreneurial
solutions to supposed technical problems. There were other things
that could be done if necessary.
But all of that was made less realistic by some people who insisted
on RBF and a hard cap on the blocksize. Mempool backlogs, high fees, and (to
a lesser extent due to the opt-in nature) the possibility of an
RBF transaction, meant the time it could take to confirm a transaction
with a reasonable fee was hours and "chargeback" risk increased. Obviously this
could never work for daily spending so in that sense I agree with you,
but I still remember halcyon days when Bitcoin's adoption in daily commerce was
growing at exciting rates even with the 10-minute block time.
I think the best criticism of Bitcoin is not a technical one at all?
it's that it was not socially robust enough to preserve the original scaling
model planned by Satoshi.
But! Number is going up! That's something at least...And to this day,
Bitcoin remains remarkably stable and inflation resistant. That counts
for something too even if it's not quite what we all hoped for...though
like I said in my last email, custodial payment layers appear to be
a ticking time bomb for state control.

Cardholders have a 60-120 day window to file chargeback
claims and there are billions of dollars in chargebacks
every year. Not to mention fraud and stolen cards.
There's plenty of information on how much money and time is lost
every year due to this. If you don't believe me, I don't have
time to explain. Run an online store and get back to me.
Bitcoin can fix that. Like I said, 10 minute non-reversibility
is better for merchants than the current chargeback window and
should result in less fraud.
Only that is muddled when blocks become full, notwistanding
the possibility that Lightning ever amounts to a real replacement for
on-chain transactions...

Great point. There is a difference between a free market process the
works out a few regions of the world as being the ideal place to conduct
a particular kind of business, and centralisation due to subsidies (theft)
from a totalitarian state (that's putting it lightly). That's an
opportunity for state capture.
Yes! If you try to play central-planner and predict the exact moment you need to
raise the blocksize, you'll f*ck it up and may lose your opportunity entirely.
And as you said, the troll army that ran disinformation campaigns and attacked
node implementations and companies trying to raise the blocksize with letters
to the SEC, DDoS, delistings and negative review brigades were highly
That's an interesting idea. I remember a lot of miners wanting to raise the
blocksize?ViaBTC, BTC.top, Bitcoin.com, AntPool, BTC.com... though talk is
cheap and in the end they certainly didn't get it done.
Regarding their financial incentives, is it not true that economies of scale
in transaction processing might net them more money than tiny blocks?
I've wondered instead whether it was the block reward that stopped them.
Hard to care about making money off millions of little transaction fees
when your primary revenue comes from a block subsidy that doesn't change
regardless of the block size.
Either way, it's clear there were parties that benefited from small blocks
in that they could build payment layers on top of Bitcoin that the peasants
have to use and pay for. They won. Good for governments too who want to regulate,
good for banks and legacy payment processors...
Thanks the thoughts. Your comments are educational as always.
