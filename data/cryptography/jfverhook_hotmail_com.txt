Hi, my name is Juan. I'm a young boy that is beginning with cryptography. I know python and basic c++, linux enthusiast, still though I just began with cryptography I want one day to build my own cryptographic hash function. Where should I begin? I would appreciate any topics regarding anything.Thanks in advance
