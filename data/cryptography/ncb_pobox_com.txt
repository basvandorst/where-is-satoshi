@_subject: Hackers Targeting Home Computers 
Having worked as a security administrator at an ISP which had a dialup subscriber base of around 300,000, I can tell you that this is not a simple task.
Like most organisations, the networking component grows sporadically as the need arises. This is the same for an ISP. This makes implementing something that works across the board very difficult, due to the "evolved" nature of the network.
Implementing something like filtered incoming traffic against hacking attempts means you straight away have to look at a network IDS. Such beasts are not only costly, but until recently have been very difficult to implement over high-bandwidth links. The ISPs have only three options - allow all, deny incoming connections to "vulnerable" ports (HTTP, Netbios), or filter everything.
It would be a nightmare to implement a network IDS for most of the larger cable and dialup providers, and that's the reason you see many of them starting to block incoming connections to the problem ports.

Within Australia, it is a legal requirement for carriers to support snooping systems. In the event of a customer being monitored, it may not be disclosed to the customer.

@_subject: ipsec for OS X? 
A cursory search on Google has not shown up any available solutions for ipsec on OS X? Has anyone come across, or know of any vendor/open-source solutions available, or soon to be?

@_subject: CFS vs. loopback encryption (was Re: [open-source] File encryption) 
What are people's thoughts on CFS vs. loopback encryption? I've used CFS in the past and found it quite useful, though as Matt said - a little long in the tooth. Never really looked into loopback encryption (which I'm aware is not something present across the majority of Unixes).

@_subject: Unbreakable? (fwd) 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't such a system feasible by:
1. Having the network infrastructure available to support the continuous traffic loads.
2. Having a suitable RNG source that can cope with the reseeding/etc requirements of encrypting bulk data.
3. Having a mechanism to insert genuine information into these massive streams of data.
I suppose the issue is communicating to the third party which part of the data contains the interesting stuff. From what Rabin is saying, it appears that the increased security is achieved by the third party not knowing what is important and what isn't. How you communicate this with your trusted third party is the problem. You can't simply send a transmission when a new section of interesting stuff is coming through, because then the evil folk can simply watch for the notification, then capture that section of the traffic.
Perhaps you could send a transmission that says "in x bytes time for the next x bytes, is the next message". That would include some latency that the evil third party can't reliably interperet. But does that work for frequent transmissions?
Seems interesting nevertheless.

With regards to the storage requirements in order to capture the massive amounts of data in Rabin's system, has anyone correlated the growth rate in mass storage devices against the network bandwidth speeds available? Ie, is there a point at which we'll have cheap enough storage to make such a system pointless (ie, we'll be able to capture all data and analyse at leisure)? Are we already at or close to that point today?

@_subject: Stego applications for other file types 
I've looked into Outguess from Neils Provos already, which supports JPEG and PNM files. I'm interested in the availability (or even feasability) of stego tools that can embed data within multimedia files like MP3's, Realaudio and Quicktime.
Anyone know of any?

Does this mean that if you are a private researcher, and reverse-engineered something for fun or the challenge, you escape the clutches of this law?
