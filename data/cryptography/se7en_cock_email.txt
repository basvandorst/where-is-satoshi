@_subject: [Cryptography] INTEL ME Mega-Leak Number 1 
There has been a mega-leak of Intel ME-related documents, schematic,
and so-on, released earlier today.
I have not finished downloading the torrent, but plan to seed it for
the next few days after its completion. Looking at some of the
semi-downloaded files, it contains a full, confidential schematic and
wiring diargam for SandyLake from 2007.
