@_subject: moving Crypto? 
There are many alternative conferences than Crypto, and many of them
are already outside the US.  Indeed, the IACR already runs EuroCrypt
and AsiaCrypt.
Personally, I think that trying to move Crypto is just an
over-reaction to the current situation.  If the situation really does
get worse (and the egg-in-face arrest wasn't an abberation) then
perhaps the conference should get moved to a more friendly North
American country.

@_subject: crypto flaw in secure mail standards 
This is not a crypto flaw.  This is an engineering flaw.
First, the timestamp of the message is certainly encoded in the
signature.  This is protection against your first suggested attack.
The recipient, upon verifying the signature, notices that it was made,
e.g., two months previously.  Then one would have to wonder why a
two-month-old message was being sent.
The other obvious problem is that although the sender's identity is
encoded in the message's signature (as well as the time the signature
is purported to be made), the original intended recipient's are not
encoded within the signed portion of the message.  The simple fix
would be to include the appropriate mail headers withing the signed
portion of the message.  In particular, including the 'To' and 'Cc'
fields would immediately protect against both of these attacks.
The problem is not at all with the crypto.  The problem is with the
integration of the crypto with applications like e-mail.
Have a nice day,

@_subject: crypto flaw in secure mail standards 
This works fine in a peer-to-peer scenario, but not if you have a
one-to-many transmission.  Just because you have a message signed in
the set {Alice,Bob,Charlie,Daniel,Eve,Fred,Greg}, there is no way to
know which of them sent it.  All members of the set must be mutually
trusted, which means there is no way to sign a document that a set of
people can verify comes EXACTLY from you.

I've been arguing for YEARS that classic firewalls, as they have been

You know, the whole "hard, crunchy exterior with soft, chewy interior"
sort of thing.  Instead if we had ubiquitous multi-level secure
services (using IPsec, SSL, SSH, PGP, Kerberos, etc.) it would be a
much better world.

I think you should specify "confidentiality" as another issue to be
addressed.  Perhaps you include confidentiality in your "privacy" or
"security" subsections, but I've found that many people think (and
mean) different things when they use these two terms.  For example, is
privacy necessarily privacy of communicated data from eavesdroppers,
or is it the privacy of personal information (perhaps the privacy of
the authentication information) so an eavesdropper does not know who
is communicating?
Unfortunately your garlic.com URL (security.htm) does not work and
returns an HTTP 404 error.

Is there even development on the PGP (product) line?  AFAIK
they (NAI) have not release PGP 7.x in source form.  Worse, there
are a couple of bugs I found in 6.5.8 when I was porting it
to Tru64, but who knows if anyone is listening over at NAI.
It's a sad state of affairs.  Perhaps I should go into "PGP
consulting", but I don't know if anyone would pay me to support
PGP for them....

I think people used to get better support when I personally answered
pgp-bugs at mit.edu.  I stopped providing that service due to lack of
time, and I'm afraid that PGP support went out the window.  From my
perspective, NAI never provided any support for PGP -- even when I
submitting patches, they would ignore them.
Even worse, when I *DID* respond to someone on pgp-bugs, I'd get a
response from NAI saying that they couldn't help me!  Yes, those
bozos actually responded to my _answer_ with a "we cannot help you"
message.  Sigh.
So, no, I'm not surprised to hear this from an actual paying customer.

Does this include the Unix CLI?  (And yes, I know a lot of my code is
in there.. I was amused when I ported 6.5.8 to Tru64.  I was also
surprised (but relieved) at the re-write of the Ascii Parser).
I sent patches to pgp-bugs at pgp.com.  Is peerreview at pgp.com documented
anywhere?  The particular bug is the COMMENT handling in the binary
So, um, what happens then?  If NAI cannot find a buyer, will they bury
the code?  Or will NAI donate the code to the OpenSource community?
If they cannot find a buyer will they relinguish the commercial rights
to the OpenSource version (i.e. so that commercial entities can use
the freeware)?

Actually, I've found it isn't quite that bad.  Yes, there are some
problems with some of the odd-man-out features.  And yes, there are
certainly problems that only get solved if users upgrade to PGP 6.5.8
or more recent versions of GPG.
I will agree with your assessment of the origin of the problem.
However I don't think it's quite as bad as you make it out to be --
I've been using PGP 6.5.8 successfully to talk to a few people.  My
biggest problem is that very few people actually use PGP.
Question: How many users of PGP 2.x are still out there?  If people
have upgraded to more recent versions, then it's not quite as bad.
OTOH, I have successfully interoperated with PGP 2.6 fairly recently.
Then again, I still use my 1992-era RSA key (I should probably upgrade
sometime soon).
If all else fails, there is always S/MIME ;)

Yes, that's what I was referring to.  I didn't recall exactly what the
mark was, but "SSSS" sounds right.  I was just annoyed because they
flagged about 30% of the flight.  Even though I was seated in like row
15/22 (in the second group to get boarded), by the time I actually
made it through the line they had already finished normal boarding and
closed the gate doors.
Hmm.  Well, I'll let you know about BOS.  And I'll find out about ORD
on my return flight.  I consider gate checks rather rude, but then
again I consider commercial travel in general rather annoying.  If it
weren't going to take me 3 days (rather than 6 hours) I would have
just flown myself out to SF....

It's a management requirement.  The manager sees "AES128" and "AES256"
and thinks "256 must be better than 128" and therefore the edict comes
down that AES256 must be used.  It's not a technical decision.  It's
not a decision made by analyzing the threats.  It's made purely
by assertion, but it's a decision that can't easily be refuted.
