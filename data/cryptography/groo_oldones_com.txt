No matter what their strategy for encrypting the on-disk passphrase,  this simple trick will work:
"ltrace -i ./vpnclient connect ... 2>&1 | fgrep 805ac57" (or similar  library call tracing technique on an OS besides linux).
This used to be used by
     but apparently they've switched to the evilscientists' method.

We (Morgan Stanley) were able to pressure them into a rapid fix, and  they have committed to delivering it in SP1.  Keep your fingers crossed.
Step (2), "On Vista you have to add this website to the list of  trusted sites in the internet-settings." can be quite unpalatable.   Depending on your customers' situations, an alternative might be more  palatable: Generate the key and deliver a PKCS
This depends on whether you believe in the non-repudiation fairy or  not -- or more accurately, whether you're already assuming the  repudiation risk.

@_subject: Permanent Privacy - Snake Oil or unbreakable encryption? 
My favorite part of that web site is from their "How it Works" section:
``For example, suppose that the plain text message is simply one 5- letter word. At first glance, you would think that this must be easy  to break. But there are, let us say, about 100 printable characters on  a computer keyboard, so there are some 100x100x100x100x100 ways of  producing a 5-letter word.''
So, let me get this straight.  You appear to be using a one-time pad,  but you discard all output that the robotic hand you send me is unable  to type on my keyboard?

Fixed in Leopard.  Certificate handling in general appears to be  better -- although I can't be sure Tiger didn't let you fiddle with  fine-grained entitlements as to when to trust a cert.

@_subject: consulting question.... (DRM) 
This is getting a bit far afield from cryptography, but proper threat  analysis is still relevant.
If this is really their threat model, it's ill-considered.  First, no  reputable company in their right mind would play games with software  licensing in an attempt to save a few dollars.  In fact, most  companies bend over backwards with internal audits and other  mechanisms to ensure they are in compliance.  The risk is far too  great to do otherwise -- both to reputation and to the bottom line.
They may counter that they are attempting to nudge into compliance  reputable companies that are simply not large enough or savvy enough  to ensure their own compliance.  In this case, something far less  complex than what is traditionally implied by "DRM" can be used.
Thus, the users you are now considering are members of _disreputable_  companies.  Since DRM is easily circumvented, and the company is  disreputable, you have a reasonable expectation that your DRM will be  Second, sysadmins have no financial motive, unless they are also the  owners.  It is irrelevant to the sysadmin whether the business pays an  appropriate amount for licenses. His salary is still his salary.
Finally, large institutions (let's take financial firms as this is my  area of expertise) will not install software that has hard expirations  or other restrictive licensing mechanisms.  The reason is simple.   These mechanisms cause outages -- sometimes because of snafus in the  renewal of licenses, sometimes because of poor code quality in the  enforcement mechanism.  At my firm, any such scheme is an immediate
