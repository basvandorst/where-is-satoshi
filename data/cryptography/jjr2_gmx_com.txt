Paper from Carnegie Mellon and Facebook: Analyzing Forged SSL
Certi?cates in the Wild: From the summary:
    We analyzed 3,447,719 real-world SSL connections and successfully
    discovered at least 6,845 (0.2%) of them were forged SSL certificates.
    Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
      o We designed a novel method for websites to collect direct
        evidence of man-in-the-middle attacks against their SSL
        connections. We further implemented this detection method on
        Facebook?s website.
      o We conducted the first analysis on forged SSL certificates by
        measuring over 3 million SSL connections. Our results show that
        0.2% SSL connections are in fact tampered with forged
        certificates.
      o Based real-world data, we categorized the root causes of forged
        SSL certificates. We showed that most of the SSL interceptions
        are due to antivirus software and organization-scale content
        filters.
      o We provided evidence of SSL interceptions by malware, which
        have infected users across at least 45 countries.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Of writing down passwords 
Abe Singer:
Agreed, as most appear to be.
How would that policy look? Would the policy protect against:
- online brute force attacks
- offline/stolen password database attacks
- phishing attacks
or would it assume that these are otherwise catered for or protected
And how long is never? My Gmail password is probably over five years
old, my Hotmail/Live password is over ten, maybe over fifteen. Should it
last another fifteen?

Jerry Leichter:
Is anybody actively working on this, other than TLAs? We know that many
eyes make bugs shallow, and few eyes allow for implementation errors
in crypto software. One or two organisations may be attempting to
factor RSA-1024, but they may not be the sort of organisations to
announce their success.

Jonathan Thornburg:
What is this "alphanumeric.encode" you speak of?
I do something similar, piping to 'openssl base64', which unfortunately
produces output without a whole lot of entropy, although it usually
satisfies at least three and often all four of the standard password
character sets.
Is there something specific you use to convert to human-readable output?

@_subject: [Cryptography] PGP-Signed Email 
And on that note: there aren't too many PGP-signed emails sent to this
list. Many years ago I used to sign all of my emails, however I came to
the conclusion that this is really quite pointless:
o it proves only that whoever sent the email had access to my private
  key at the time; and
o provides non-repudiation, which is bad in the case that the person
  who had access to my private key wasn't me.
This thread that I have hijacked shows a use case for signing, but,
outside that, is there any evidence or even any suspicions that email
sent to a list like this is likely to be or has been maliciously
modified in transit, without otherwise being detected, and therefore
would benefit from signing?
I understand that there is a perceived value in signing all emails,
thereby establishing a habit which "proves" that an unsigned email did
not come from the apparent sender; however in practice I have noticed
that there are often occurrences where a machine is being rebuilt or an
email is sent from a mobile device or some other thing happens in which
the sender who always sends PGP-signed emails can't, therefore
destroying that entire benefit.
So, my question then is: what are the benefits of always sending
PGP-signed email and calling out when email is not signed, especially on
open email lists such as this?

Thanks Moritz, very much along my lines of thinking.
Phillip Hallam-Baker:
I read the analysis as being about the complexity of presenting
information to the user. Does a signed email mean that it came from the
sender? It should, however it doesn't.

Agree that this is possible, however is there any evidence that it
actually occurs, or is even likely. (I do agree with your last point:
threat models are important, and there are some cases where always
signing is important; but it should then be used in conjunction with
other opsec practices to mitigate the attack vectors you list.)
Is there actually a need to /sign/ each email to lay the groundwork for
demonstrating ownership of a key? Or is is good enough to just include
the ID/fingerprint in each email? If there are three years' worth of
unsigned email listing a specific key followed then by an email signed
by that key, is that somehow less secure than having three years' worth
of email signed with that key.
Indeed! I agree completely with this statement.

[ Snip a bunch of commentary that I don't quite agree with, however ...]
This is indeed where I think we need to go. I know many people who do
this manually now, e.g. "let's discuss this via Signal or Wickr rather
than via corporate email". Making this automatic in a fashion similar
to cipher suite and protocol negotiation would be a large step forward.
I do see some complexity in customisation, e.g. how a user or an
enterprise specifies which services they support and in which order or
preference, however this would be a much better problem to solve than
the problem of better securing email.

Indeed, they are reasons for me to protect my key well, and also
reasons to cast doubt on the sender of a signed email as I cannot check
the extend to which the claimed sender has protected her key. I know
too many people with good security knowledge and bad opsec.
Ah, yes, thank you, I had not considered this. As there is no one to
verify the sender it is left to technology to to so.
Exactly the sort of answer I was looking for!

@_subject: [Cryptography] Firewall penetration 
PC remote control services such as GoToMyPC, TeamViewer and LogMeIn
avoid direct communications and proxy the connections through a central
server. This means that standard home routers can have a firewall
denying all inbound connections and utilise simple NAT configurations,
but still allow a remote device to connect "in". In practice, both ends
of the connection connect out to the central server which acts as a
switchboard to establish a circuit.
Tor hidden services can be used to achieve the same thing.

Peter Gutmann:
If the hardware is classified as non-sensitive then it will be
protected accordingly, which could mean that it won't have had the
appropriate protections once it has had the algorithm loaded and
therefore has been reclassified.
It should really be classified according to what it will or could or is
likely to be used for.
Of course I'm assuming that people actually take notice of a thing's
classification ...
