Interesting  (new) thread. A secure public communication has two essentiaks
for me. First, the ISP should be kept out to be able ro read if not a
member of the list. Second there should be a secret only all members know
and which keeps third party out.
A solution providing this is a so called  Buzz-Channel. It is like an Irc-
Room which is encrypted. Only members with a key can read and post.
You find the software under Can anyone provide a listener ip and a channel name ? Ready for a and
having fun with a test ?
