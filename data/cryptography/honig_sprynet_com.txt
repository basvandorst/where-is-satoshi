A.A.M + PGP = covert radio transmitter which sends coded messages.  Obviously
interesting, so you direction-find to defeat the anonymity.
[Moderator's note: And how would you possibly do that? --Perry]
Stego = signalling via called-in requests to a commercial music radio station.
Not interesting.
Sure its extra work but high risk requires high effort.
Strong-anonymous broadcasting takes work too.

On the subject of stego, this showed up earlier this week: We've put into Morpheus a song, which has a stego'd message in it.
The tool is mp3stego v 1.1.15 (source available; see  ) and the (3DES) passphrase is "writecode"
Another file "DrDidg_RaveOn.mp3" has
another message under the same passphrase.
We are curious how readily the Morpheus search
engine can be used for transport purposes.  In
this instance we give unique names to files not
otherwise found in the system.  Another experiment
in P2P percolation would be to add similar 'watermarks' (microdots) to files which are abundantly replicated.

Anonymity, like much of crypto or security, is an arms race.  A radio TX would try bursty sending.  So the DXer must keep his receivers
going all the time.  So the TXer has to move to a different
place each time he sends.  So the DXer needs a larger mesh
of receiver stations and faster response; recording travel (license
plate cams, requiring ID on busses) helps too.  Ultimately the
DXer can do a physical search on everyone.  So the TXer has to embed
the transmitter in his body.  So the DXer has to X-ray everyone, etc.
Faster foxes lead to faster rabbits which lead to faster foxes.
Similarly with "anonymous" IP broadcast.  Place enough surveillance cameras,
subvert enough ISPs/remailers, deploy enough trojans, do enough traffic
analysis, and strong anonymity takes much more effort.  At that point the
effort for stego might have been a good tradeoff.
The point of stego, it seems to me, is to not attract such attention
in the first place.  Although *if* you're already on someone's "Watch List"
there may be little point.
Another example: You could have an encrypted, deniable filesystem with duress
passphrases, etc.  But you still have to deal with Mr. Happy-Fun Customs
Agent who wants to know what kind of naughty bits you're importing.  A
collection of baby pictures requires no explanation, no special flag in the
records that track you.
And is out of range of the guided missile which was "accidentally"
mistargeted due to "out of date" maps.  And which doesn't need
to interact with the US financial tentacles.  Which can maybe survive
a physical embargo.  Whose sysop is immune from coercion or bribery.
Yes --much like a covert radio transmitter.

One of the more interesting conclusions of Marks is that different
cognitive types require different kinds of instruction in crypto
techniques ---some learned rote behavior, some needed reasons.
One of the more poignant parts of his memoirs is that he knew that
half his pupils would be dead soon after dropping.  Another is his worries when trying to figure if someone behind
the lines had been compromised (and their directions should not be followed) or they are merely forgetful or stressed.  He would refer to their records during study, to see the kinds of errors they made, to help him decide.

Good point.  There's no way without a trusted host somewhere.  Imagine that you scanned the paper doc, inspected it visually,
and digitally signed the image file.  Even this is succeptible to
a trojan that alters the display, alters what's printed, etc.
If you do have a little trusted island, e.g., a java button
on a ring you wear in the shower, or a PDA display you trust, you can often leverage this to make a trusted system.

1. Yes, using counter-modes of operation you can run an
arbitrarily-large array of arbitrarily-slow block cipher chips to generate crypto blocks as fast as required.  Each
block cipher chip needs a counter.
e.g., if a chip takes 40 clocks to encrypt, and you need
a new encrypted block to xor with your plaintext on every clock,
you run 40 chips.  The first, started on clock 0, encrypts 0, the second
started on clock 1 encrypts 1, the third 2, etc.  Each clock a chip is 'harvested', and that chip's counter increments by 40.
(You don't need decrypt functionality in the block cipher chips to
decrypt, since you are using your bank of staggered, counter-fed
block cipher chips as a keyed pseudorandom stream generator with xor.)
2. Firms which wish to rent out their internal networks
(e.g., during off hours) have an interest in encrypting (& tunnelling) all the packets to avoid A. others mapping
their internal networks B. lawsuits when the renters
suspect the rentees of looking at their data C. lawsuits
when the renters are held responsible for the rentee's data.

But you can change its openness after you inspect it.  Epoxy can be useful.
So can software tools that prevent or detect changes to system files.
The problem is 1. acquire the skills needed to analyze or synthesize the
artifact or 2. acquire other people with those skills who you trust.
Once you've verified that the artifact is 'secure' from inspection, you then
immediately 'seal' it ---epoxy the case, checksum the system files.
Suggestion 2. can be practically implemented by dedicated labs (e.g., the
underwriters lab) IFF you trust said labs, and IFF their tamper-evident

Under an assumed name , and download your FORTH CPU into the FPGA, including
Both Altera and Xilinx have their own FPGA-embeddable soft CPUs, as well as supporting other popular CPU designs (e.g., ARM) which are also available in HDLs.
Amen.  But putting a trapdoor in a HDL synthesizer (analogous to KT's evil compiler) would be a real chore.  Though some easy holes,
like inserting a covert oscillator modulated by an interesting signal, could
be a covert RF-emission 'asset'.  Those long cross-chip routing wires are cm-sized antennae, no?  Still, your (vendor-specific) FPGA-specific place & route tool (analogous to an assembler) would show the gates unless it too had been subverted.
And the test structures (JTAG? JEDEC? lets you read out
otherwise hidden internal state via a special test mode) are almost always there ---even in crypto chips.
A real Achilles heel one imagines.

You hint at this in your discussion, but if you were building a backdoor into a chip (say a block cipher) you *must* make
the trigger a *sequence* rather than a single input, since
1. testing the specified (one input -> one output) behavior
is what the tester will look for -that's what's specified
2. with a sequence of inputs, the search-space expands to where the tester has no hope of finding the magic words ---the MTBF of the devices will
happen first.
Any device (CPU, NIC, OS) which sees an externally generated stream is
succeptible.  The next Metallica song could contain a trigger that
irreversibly destroys a certain model MP3 player if its played...
Not even mentioning the in-field-programmable wireless devices coming to a future near you.

True.  But they hired *you*, and you know your stuff, which makes *them*

You'd instruct them on secure behaviors (no beards, carry liquor; burn your
silks and flush them immediately; take a original digphoto or scan something
for stego) and make sure they practiced them.  Well.
Similarly for passwords, of course.
As Leo Marks (_Between Silk & Cyanide_) wrote, some folks perform better
with a deep understanding of *why* (e.g., what happens if you use a OTP
twice), others do better through superficial 'ritualistic' practice.
