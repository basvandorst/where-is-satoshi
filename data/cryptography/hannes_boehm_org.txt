@_subject: Quantum Computing Puts Encrypted Messages at Risk 
QKD is a way to prevent a possible eavesdropper to listen to the Key Distribution System. In classical encryption the fist step is
always to intercept the encrypted message - this is where QC starts.
The key, which is later used as a classical One-Time-Pad, is distributed in a way
a eavesdropper can be detected, it can not be prevented though. This opens
the doors for DoS attacks. But: If the key has been transmitted without
an eavesdropper, than we have a 100% truly random one-time pad which has been prooven to be unbreakable.
An eavesdropper can be detected by the amount of Quantum Noise he introduces in the
Quantum channel. Since a Qubit (Qutrit or Qunit) can not be cloned perfectly
every attempt to listen to the Quantum Channel introduces some noise. This noise
is added to the noise already present on the Quantum channel. If the Quantum noise
reaches a certain theoretical ratio, we know that someone listens to the channel.
One word on cloning: Yes, cloning is possible ! No, it does not break QKD !
Copying of quantum states is possible, but not in a deterministic fashion. The maximum (theoretical) probability to get an identical copy of a qubit is 5/6. This has been demonstrated already experimentaly. Since there is a functonal dependence between noise and  extracted information, this is just an additional factor. It just reduces the distances we can reach, and the bitrates we can achieve. (It can be shown that perfect quantum cloning is not possible for what type of cloning
 mechanism whatsoever - AND (independently of the proof): if it would be possible, we could  communicate with speeds faster than that of light  and therefore it would also violat
 special relativity)
What we have here is a theory which is almost as old as the special theory of relativity
and has not yet prooven wrong. This theory tells us that there is no way whatever, that
a possible eavesdropper can listen to the key exchange. It also tells us that if we use either a Quantum random number generator or an entangled photon QKD system, that we get absolutly random numbers.
I recomend everyone who is interested in QKD to read an introduction to quantum theory. Everything QKD is about is just plain vector multiplication. It is a beautiful (=simple) theory. Okay. If you have questions, please feel free to drop me an email.
I am currently in my final year of graduate studies in physics. For my diploma thesis, I am working on a project in the field of Experimental Quantum Information. So hopfully I might be able to answer some of your questions :-)
BTW: there are already comercial QKD systems available

This is a result from the non-cloning theorem and is well studied in Quantum Cryptography. Even though a practical realization which hits the theoretical limit is quite impressive.
A simpliefied introduction to the consequences of imperfect cloning of quantum states in QKD is found in a recent paper of Gisin et. al. called "Quantum Cryptography"
and was published in the "Review of Modern Physics" (sorry no exact citation - i have only the pre-print).
Back to the problem:
The 16% in which the cloning is "wrong", introduce a QBER (equiv to the classical
Bit Error Rate (BER)) in the Quantum channel. Since a system without an eavesdropper
has QBERs of about a few percent this makes it possible to detect the eavesdropper.
[in the case the cloned photon is sent to Bob - in the other case, where the cloned
 photon is used for a measurment, the information gathered by Eve is simply reduced to 84%]
If you use the Wigner protocol, this should also prevent a violation of the Bell inequalities.
(is there a paper which shows the relation between QBER and the Bell inequalities ?)
I think it has been shown that if the information that Eve gathered is less than the information of Bob, then it is possible to create a secret key through privacy amplification. This is
important since it tells us that even if our Eavesdropper reduces the cloning attempts (which reduces the QBER) it is not possible to reconstruct the key.
Summery: Eve either intruduces enough QBER to detect her, or she does not get enough information
         to reconstruct the key
Result: QC is not broken but it makes the job harder and the achievable QKD bitrates lower

Yes - a little.
As far as I know, they use phase coding of weak pulses
(meaning that a puls contains an average of less than a photon).
The average number of photons per puls depends on the probability you want to have that a puls carries more than one photon (as determined by
statistic calculations).
Phase coding works with an interferometer (actually it is a double interferometer)
setup. Alice and Bob are on different arms of the (Mach-Zehnder) Interferometer and are both aplying phase shifts on the wave function of the photon (randomly).
IMHO the weak puls method is not as beautiful as a
entangled photon implementation, since there is still the possibility
that more than one photon carries the information (even though, statistics
teaches us that this probability can be made abitarly small)
And: there have to be random number generators on Alice and Bobs side - whereas with entangled photons, the key is created simultaniously on both sides ("it never passes the wire").
But: it is available now, as far as I know there is no comercial systems with entangled photons to date - even though it has been demonstrated in the lab. I think that soon other systems will be available to choose from - lets wait and see.
What I can tell about the company "idquantique.com" is, that it was
founded as an offspring of the university of Geneva. Somehow Nicolas Gisin
is involved, who is one of THE experts on the field of Quantum Cryptography.
(I dont know wether it belongs to the university or not)
