Failure to tell the whole truth is a form of dishonesty, just as is
telling a lie.
By silently, implicitly adopting a narrow definition of "security",
Hush are able to claim "Only Hush's solution provides such a high
level of security combined with total ease of use." [1]
The larger truth is that a consequence of using Hushmail is that
record of when, with whom, and the size of each communication is
available to Hush, even though the content is concealed.
According to the original poster, it's these kinds of data that
Hushmail was required to turn over to the US DEA.

They can't be as "anonymous as cash" if the party being dealt with can
be identified.  And the party can be identified if the transaction is
"online, real-time".  Even if other clues are erased, there's still
traffic analysis in this case.
What the offline paradigm has going for it is the possibility of true,
untraceable anonymity through the use of anonymizing remailers and
related technologies.
