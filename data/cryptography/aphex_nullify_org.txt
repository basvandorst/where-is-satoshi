@_subject: PGP & GPG compatibility 
Quoting David Shaw :
How about encrypting and signing with GnuPG to a PGP 2 user?  According to the
GnuPG website, it takes FOUR steps to simply encrypt and sign a document to a
PGP 2.6 user.
In fact, the most common reason cited for staying with PGP 2 is for
compatibility reasons.  However, GnuPG has no way of knowing what version a
particular key corresponds to.  Recently, various GnuPG "front-ends" have begun
implementing multiple configurations to help solve this issue, but the user has
to manually select which configuration to use with a particular recipient. Trying to encrypt to multiple recipients is an exercise in futility.
