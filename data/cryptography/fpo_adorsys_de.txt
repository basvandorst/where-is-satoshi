We are working on launching such a product. Not obvious at all as we
have to deal with:
- social secret sharing and recovery
- time as the enemy of encrypted/signed messages
- social impacts of trusted/trustee relationships
- social engineering risks
Will be publishing some work soon.
If you are interested in a presentation of our work, send me a
Best regards.

Excellent document. Wonder if there is any reusable implementation of UDF
out there?
I would start with a java library if there is no indication of any existing
How does this relate to social key recovery?
Yes.  Secret sharing algorithms have been out there for a while.
The challenge is the development of a simple social key recovery app for
common users.

I wouldn't rely on any kind of solid enough cryptographic algorithm or
durable enough storage. Time is the enemy of all these properties. Adequate
solution needs a procedure with a lot of rotation of everything, starting
with the secret itself, crypto keys, storage, data, trusted  people,
transparency logs.
Secret sharing looks good, but is difficult to apply among common users.
Muss be wrapped into simple to use apps to fulfill its promise.
They do not help, as those images will leak through surveillance cameras we
have installed out there.
programming languages. None of the protocols shall depend on a specific
programming language anyway.
