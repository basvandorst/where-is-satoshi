Hmmm, but to do that one needs to have a good definition of 'encryption
algorithm' and perhaps also some other apparently fundamental terms. But
we have none, I am afraid ... at least it seems it is hard to give precise
definition even of the cryptography alone (the old one relating that to
'secure communication over insecure channel' seems not to be consistent
with quantum crypto...)
