I'm sure the DRM helmets are just the first primitive technology. With advances in science, I think we can be protected from copyright material by brain implants which turn us blind and deaf protecting the Digital Rights of large corporations. Lightweight, wireless, eternally vigilant guarding copyright material, whether on radio, TV, computer or at a public concert.  :-O
