@_subject: DeCSS, crypto, (regions removed??!) 
I dont know if this is relevant to the discussion, but in Sweden (not a region-1 country) people where so pissed at the regionsystem (and the fact that most computer geeks could go around it, but the average person could not) that the whole region concept had to be removed. Ie. this forced the large companies to rethink and nowadays we have commercial region-free DVD players in most stores.
It's a bit of a laugh that they now list "Region free" as a feature to increase sales.
