@_subject: Anonymous blogging experiment 
A few weeks back on the cryptography list someone asked about anonymous blogging software and hosting.
I've put together a simple system which I think meets the requirements: a remailer/PGP interface to a weblog hosting service.  It needs testing, so I'm offering free hosting to a few anonymous bloggers to help try it out.  Familiarity with mixmaster and PGP or GPG is Replies via remailer and PGP only please.  Fingerprint is listed below.  Make sure you include a public key and either a working nym or instructions on how I can contact you.

@_subject: Anonymous blog experiment, take two 
I've put together an experimental remailer/PGP interface to a weblog
hosting service.  Creating a blog and posting are entirely one-way processes via Mixmaster; there's no need for nyms or reply blocks.
The short version, for those familiar with PGP and mixmaster:
To create a blog, generate a new PGP key.  Set the Name field to 'invisiblog' and optionally put a name or description in the Comment field.  Use mixmaster to send the ascii-exported public key to signup at invisiblog.com.  Each new blog will show up at  as soon as its key is received.
To post, clearsign a message and send it to post at invisiblog.com.  The fingerprint of the signing key is used to figure out which blog to post it to.  There's no way to delete or modify posts.
If a first attempt at creating a blog or posting fails, resend - it'll ignore dupes.
