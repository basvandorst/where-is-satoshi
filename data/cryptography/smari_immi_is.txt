An alternative I've been considering is having e-mail clients support
bouncing messages if they are received for an incorrect envelope
address. So you can have an envelope address and a PGP encrypted blob,
and when you decrypt that blob there's a new RFC822 with a new envelope
address and another PGP encrypted blob. If e-mail clients honor a
forwarding agreement on this kind of message, it will be practically
impossible to tell who sent the original message and who is the final
The really hard bit about this is that there are a lot of e-mail clients
out there, and getting them all to support this - even optionally - is
may take some doing.

Disagree. Lavabit is a good example only in that they did the right
thing in the face of legal pressure. That is politically very
important and I'm thankful that they did it, but they are a terrible
example every other way. They had an insecure system ("let us store
your keymatter, your ciphertext, and receive your passphrase - but we
can't decrypt it, honest!"). It was possible to put that system under
legal pressure. That should not have been possible.
If we were to see Lavabit resume (as they tried to do with vague
promises of releasing their currently existing source code in exchange
for large sums of money - see
 ),
I would hope that this community would hold them to a very high
standard. Moxie has attempted to do so with good results:
I do not mean to say that these people cannot produce secure systems,
merely that they have misled people in the past in ways where they
certainly should have known better.
