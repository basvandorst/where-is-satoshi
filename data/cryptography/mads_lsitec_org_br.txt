@_subject: quantum chip built 
They seems to have built a device which can store one qubit, isolated from the rest of the world. They seem to be able to scale up their technique to store many qubits, but I strongly suspect that they cannot store those many qubits COHERENTLY. To store reliably individual qubits is not that difficult, but to prevent entangled systems from interacting with the environment is very, very difficult.
Maybe someone else can give more information?

@_subject: switching from SHA-1 to Tiger ? 
Maybe you haven't heard but Tiger is being analysed against collision attack
At FSE 2006 Kelsey and Stefan Lucks presented a paper on Tiger
John Kelsey, Stefan Lucks:  Collisions and Near-Collisions for Reduced-Round Tiger, Preproceedings of FSE 2006.
We describe a collision-finding attack on 16 rounds of the Tiger hash function requiring the time for about 2^44 compression function invocations. Another attack generates pseudo-near collisions, but for 20 rounds of Tiger with work less than that of 2^48 compression function invocations. Since Tiger has only 24 rounds, these attacks may raise some questions about the security of Tiger. In developing these attacks, we adapt the ideas of message modification attacks and neutral bits, developed in the analysis of MD4 family hashes, to a completely different hash function design.

@_subject: more MD5 collisions 
John Black, Martin Cochran, and Trevor Highland had an optimized attack at FSE this year, they also released a toolkit for finding the collisions and playing around with the attack techniques.

@_subject: Phd thesis on voting 
I haven't seen this mentioned here:
Ben Adida did a Phd thesis on voting at MIT (ended this August)
At his blog there is more material available such as conference slides, paper etc.

@_subject: Public key encrypt-then-sign or sign-then-encrypt? 
Hugo Krawczyk [1] showed in the symmetric key setting that the encrypt-then-authenticate was the way to go about securing the integrity of an encrypted message.
What about the public key setting?
Jee Hea An, Yevgeniy Dodis and Tal Rabin claims that the order doesn't matter [2]. Encrypt-then-sign or sign-then-encrypt is equally secure.
Is this really true? My feeling was that the principle from Krawczyk's paper should apply to the public key setting as well.
Did anyone anyone ever publish a follow up to [2] ? I wasn't able to find any.

@_subject: Destroying confidential information from database 
I know of procedures and programs to erase files securely from disks, Guttman did a paper on that....
What I don't know is how to securely erase information from a database.
I cannot assume that the vendor solves this matter, anyone have a clue?
