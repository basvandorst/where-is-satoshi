Indeed, and that's an issue. Unfortunately the unhappy path isn't a
closed set of possibilities, so I doubt that any deterministic test
could significantly help. And this suite (an older version than the current) was used to test the
verification routines of gnutls since long time; it did help with
expected failures, but did few for unexpected failures. The approach
shown in Victor's link or another fuzzying approach is more promising in
that respect.

You answer is twisting facts. The export ciphers were not because
everyone could propose their own pet algorithm. The export ciphers were
part of the core SSL 3.0 specification. Whether the specification
allowed its extension beyond the export ciphers is irrelevant. Actually,
the fact that today we use AES instead of RC4-40 is just because SSL 3.0
had agility.
retire Could you please elaborate what you mean here? Several implementations
switched, and actually disabled the export ciphersuites years ago (in
gnutls we completely removed support for export ciphers in 2013, and
even before it was disabled by default). The reason browsers kept the
export ciphers, is mostly attributed to their strive for 100%
compatibility with any legacy server out there.
