In LXC containers (  ) one can use the following:
lxc.mount.entry = /dev/random dev/random none bind,create=file 0 0

I think that most of the filesystem crypto users don't really know
that their crypto strategy offers them no security or protection at all.
For example:
1) someone steals all your encrypted files (incl. the key file)
2) someone steals (or seizes) your HD, or the whole computer
How do the current solutions protect against these scenarios
if the perpetrator/bigbrother has somehow hacked the system
user password, so he can login to the system, and thereby
gets automatically access to the encrypted filesystems since
most of them automatically mount...?
I think these auto-mounting people don't really know what they do, do they?
What 'best practices' for filesystem encryption are there?

Imagine this: you have the encrypted filesystem and the accompanying keyfile.
Even if you don't know the owning user's system password, you still
can make the encrypted filesystem readable by just mounting it on
your own computer, and voila!
So, there is IMO a big security problem with such auto-mount configurations.
The problem is "protection in the emergency case",
ie. if the filesystem + keyfile, or the computer / HD / stick, gets stolen or After all, for what other cases is encryption good at all? :-)
I mean, I would ask/request/demand protection especially in such emergency cases.
But an auto-mount setup obviously cannot be of help here.
There belongs some more for a really secure system that also covers the said emergency cases.

A mountable encrypted filesystem is sufficient for me, for example /home/user-me.
But there should also be protection in case if that filesystem gets stolen/seized.
Yeah, an encrypted filesystem solves that too, ie. the enc of the filenames and dirs.
I think nobody has the obligation to, nor should, help his own enemy...
Exactly :-)
I wanted to point especially to the two emergency cases given in the initial posting (files/HD/comp stolen/seized).
It definitely belongs some additional steps in the encryption strategy to cover also the said cases; IMO these are even the main cases to protect against.

Hi, thanks, I know, I just wanted to point to a weak point
in filesystem encryption if auto-mount gets used, and the
filesystem/HD/comp gets stolen/seized...
In such cases the current solutions don't help much; there belongs
some more steps to cover also these cases.
BTW, I'm using Linux (Debian 8), currently testing 'cryptsetup'
and 'cryptmount' for encrypting personal home directory in a
mountable encryped filesystem file (_not_ whole disk or partition encryption).
Any other alternatives I should check?
