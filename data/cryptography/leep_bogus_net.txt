@_subject: 3DES performance 
I'm working on a project for a company that involves the use of 3DES. They have
asked me to find out what the overheads are for encrypting a binary file. There
will be quite a lot of traffic coming in (in the region of hundreds of
thousands of files per hour). Has anyone got any figures for 3DES performance?
I've tried bdes on OpenBSD which has given me some useful results.
Many thanks,

@_subject: Proving the randomness of a random number generator? 
Apologies if this has been asked before.
The company I work for has been asked to prove the randomness of a random
number generator. I assume they mean an PRNG, but knowing my employer it
could be anything.. I've turned the work down on the basis of having another
gig that week. However, it raised the issue of just how this could be achieved. As far as I'm aware there are no strong mathematicians in the team, so
it will get thrown out to the first available person (cool idea, eh?). There
will most likely be very little time allocated to do it.
So, the question is, how can the randomness of a PRNG be proved within reasonable limits of time, processing availability and skill?

@_subject: Countries that ban the use of crypto? 
A colleague of mine is locked in a battle with a client about the use of
NULL ciphers for OpenSSL. The client claims that he has/wants to allow NULL
ciphers so that people in countries that ban the use of crypto can still use
the website. My colleague wants to know if there is a list of such countries
that he could use.
Many thanks,

@_subject: ATM machine security 
I'm working on a project that requires a benchmark against which to judge
various suppliers. The closest that has similar requirements is the ATM industry. To this end I'm looking for any papers, specifications or published attacks against ATM machines and their infrastructure. I'm also looking for what
type of networks they use and the crypto they use to protect comms.
Also any standards would be good that the ATM industry has to adhere to.

@_subject: FW: ATM machine security 
No problem. As it happens the project I'm working on isn't for ATMs but for
a system that shares some similarities: * Located in potentially hostile environments
* Subject to abuse and civil disobedience
* Use of crypto and anti tampering devices
* Compliance with a standard outlined by the police and understood in the
  legal system [1]
[1] The standards are 9 years old, but they were, at the time, in line with
what the financial industry used. However, as we all know, industry has moved
on and we are looking to see if the vendors are keeping up with better practice
than was available 9 years ago.
One of the main things I'm looking for is not so much *how* to break into an
ATM, but what happens when one is, for example, are the keys (if pre-shared)
deleted? One vendor of the system has the key encryption key (KEK) stored on
a smartcard, which won't be deleted if power is lost. This goes against the
police guidelines, but there may be a precedent in the financial industry that
says "Hey, that's ok if you do X,Y and Z". My employer is looking for that sort
of information, especially if it is easily understood by lawyers. The financial
industry provided the best background for a legal system to understand.
I work for a large global Professional Services company, but I prefer to keep
queries like this to my private email address. But, and you'll just _have_ to
trust me on this one, I don't do anything illegal because I know I'd get caught :) Besides, doing fun stuff and getting paid for it is far better than
being in jail..
See above, but basically the bidders need to be able to justify that the system
they are going to use has safeguards in place. We aren't talking about money
here, but there is a watertight need to maintain evidential integrity of the
data transmitted across the network. The network itself will be protected via
VPN *BUT* it will be assumed to be a hostile network, and potentially an
attacker could harvest enough packets to make a brute force attack viable.
Standards, so many to choose from :)
