A Certificate does not offer “proof" that the “public key was generated properly”. It proves the identity of the public key. Unless they are not using a normal term for “proof” and/or “properly", I find this hard to believe that an EC public key can be “proven” that it was generated properly.

Compare this to Stuxnet, which is broadly assumed to be state sponsored, Juniper’s transgressions are child’s play. If this is state sponsored, it is not a particularly capable state. I would leave China and Russia out unless their goal was to embarrass Juniper and get their domestic customers to stop buying foreign products.

None. They are padded to either 512 or 4k. Certainly the trim would be to those boundaries. Regarding trim in general, SMITH: Doctor, it hurts when I doÂ this. DALE: Don'tÂ doÂ that. If someone has access to your encrypted disk and images your encrypted drive, then you use the device again, and they image your drive again and compare, they will have FAR more information that what trim gives. Disable trim if you can, but even then, it is still is not a deniable file system  by any means (I like â3. An Alternative Construction").

At the risk of igniting a flame war, there is no analysis of SMS4 that says it is âcrapâ. None, zip, nada.

If the algorithm was crap, there would be academics eager to publish their cryptanalysis.

That can not be said for the other ânationalâ algorithms. Emphasis on PUBLIC gauntlet. Given that the IETF can not muster the level of scrutiny to any other algorithm that was spent on AES, the IETF seems to be the tail on this dog. Be careful what you ask for.

This would either not be used or create a collusion attack that would make it useless.
International cooperative policing is not the choice of governments in many, if not most, cases. Even if the UN could create such an agreement:  The majority of “normal” non-FISA cases would overwhelm this process or turn it into a rubberstamp that can be easily gamed, Fail.
This would not meet FISA secrecy needs thus would not meet the government's needs.  Fail. the Iranians talk to a bunch of their friends and gets the majority of keys for Iranian customers. Unfettered access, no oversight, Fail. Even if it is deployed, Telling the USA that China wants to investigate a US citizen for espionage would never happen. None of the US allies would agree, nor would China want for any of the US allies to know.. This would lead to sets of “willing allies” by target to create a similar set of like minded ruberstamp for each target country… For instance, Targets in Russia would include pieces from US and EU, targets in USA would include pieces from China, Russia and their satellites, etc. Because of this, no country would agree to this. Again, fail. It is my opinion that secret splitting is a technology mathematically works, but the analysis can not stop at the math. A complete set of details of combination of human nature, governmental pressures, police processes must be considered along with all possible “gaming” of the system. My personal conjecture is that split golden key is no better than single golden key because any human process where the split key works, that process can be implemented around a single golden key. Susan Landau says "no legislation requiring exceptional access should be considered unless the particulars of the proposal — the technical particulars — are presented. Otherwise we would be mandating insecurity when what we need is just the opposite.”  and, contrary to the opinions of many Mathematicians, “technical particulars” do not end at the math.

Nice discussion. Thanks. For the internal escrow of a single organization to make sure there is is sufficient collusion for a rare one time event, OK. Makes sense but this is not in this case. In just the USA, the FISA court issued 1,588 warrants in 2013 or about 4/day. Assume they are not going down, and assume that this is related to the populations size. That is 1 warrant for every 200k people/yr. Assuming that people in the USA are just as bad as the rest of the world, based on a world population of 7.3B with 1 in 200k “bad", that is ~100/day. Lets test this conjecture: With key split: 100 times every day (365/year) the 5 of the 10 people give their part to the (validated) requestor. What are they going to do now? The requestor has the single golden key. The part holders must watch how the golden key, is used, and destroyed to ensure it was used for the purpose it was intended and not stolen. Stolen once, BZZZZ, game over. Do you think we can hide the combiner inside millions of lines of complicated code and expect that it stays secure? Would this need to be repeated for each cell phone operator? or even each cell phone builder? We can’t even reliably build a random number generator.
Without key split: Have a room with 5 locks. all 5 keys need to be present. Yes, they can be different organizations. The five people must now watch the person wielding the golden key. The five people make sure the room is locked (and the 5 alarms set). Stolen once, BZZZZ, game over. Same.
Bottom line, why not put the data in a room with a lot of locks, guards, guns, gates, and process and just do the last step making sure the warrant is followed? Wasn’t that what has already tried? The last step is the problem the rest are red herrings. How is any of this math magic making things better.
Another issue. Given that it is nation states that “need” this recombined golden key and to be able to secretly wield it, the nation states will be a huge amount of time and money put into getting it. Assume they get it, what do we do? Rekey everything?
We are quibbling about the dividing line between math and human process. No one can have control over the golden key or the re-combination of the split golden keys without an incredible amount human process oversight and trust. I believe my conjecture still stands, key escrow (split or not) is ultimately the same. Worse case, waving the flag of magic math to politicians provides a fig leaf of “being a better solution” opening the door to "BZZZ, game over". There is no simple solution. This is a really gnarly problem, and Shamir Secret Sharing (rebranded as Chaum) is not the silver bullet.
BTW, this still does not work even if single split golden key for each phone. It is the human/geopolitical problems that will fail, not the math.
Three basic classes of people use cryptography. Plain people living normally, criminals where there would be a broad consensus of them being “bad”, and governments. Imagine how this works. The USG says Snowden is bad, China, Russia say he is good. What happens? Nothing. Seems like this is a UN security council where any one country can veto. This may be what we want (an escrow system that is unusable) but it is not what will make governments happy.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Time(keeping) and Crypto-Economics 
Here is a comment. The use of a cryptoCurrency as a time stamping service seems to be significantly more complex than that provided by other time stamping services like GuardTime . (I am not affiliated with GuardTime). Both require that you hash up your object. If you just want to prove existence, you are done. If not, you need to use a signature (requires a private key) and then done. With CryptoCurrency, you need a private key and to get the transaction to the miners. I honestly do not understand the value of putting the hash of the object into the blockchain when a timestamp like guardtime proves the same thing. Lastly, yes, common time and cybercurrencies have a notion of monotonically increasing assets.  Common time, is, well, more common. Anyway, if this is a serious paper, comparing and contrasting these two methods is a minimum.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Gates are cheap. Should cipher design change? 
That’s what the author’s claims, yes.
That’s also what the author’s claim, but both have 128 bit block and 256 bit keys, the same parameters of the heaviest AES. There have been no papers suggesting that it is not as secure as AES. So it’s a single algorithm that can be used for trivial or serious cryptography.
I would not design a new just because I have a lot of gates. You should 1) choose an algorithm that you have confidence in being secure. 2) Implement it in a way that is correct and 3)make it fast. I would completely unroll Simpn and implement it in clockless hardware. The value of Simon is that there is no ALU or carry chain. Only requiring and, xor and shift. A hallway conversation with a cryptographer at Galios.com said it was possible with their hardware synthesis methodology.
In addition, the original thought was about a "modern cipher”. There are three such reasons I believe Simon meets this criteria. 1) Many would consider a cipher that is relatively trivial to analyze for security would be an advancement over many other ciphers. Algorithms with “expensive” gates (I read as complicated primitives) are harder to analyze. 2) S-Boxes have a significant amount of “magic” in the choice of the S-Box. An algorithm with S-Boxes has similarity to DES (not a modern cipher unless 1974 was the beginning of the “Modern” era). The choice of the S-Boxes was the number one worry about DES which was never proven to have or not have a flaw. 3) Another definition of Modern would be newer. Simon meets all three of these criteria.
Frankly, I don’t want this to devolve into a religious arguments, Simon is my current fav. We can drop it at that.

g and p of Diffie Hellman are parameters chosen from a random distribution, not part of the algorithm itself. The original papers actually stated using constants for g and p was insecure. The problem is not the algorithm, it is the improper standardization of random parameters and the inflexibility of the protocols to allow these parameters to to be used as designed.

Agree… Constant group: bad. unknown-provenance negotiated parameters: bad. I am guessing that there are 2 problems/solutions… 1) In the protocols, there is no way to blacklist known bad groups or even reject duplicate groups (for some method of determining duplicate groups). No way for the recipient to say “no” to the negotiated parameters other than terminating the connection. 2) Another solution is to negotiate parameters. The g and p may be some non-trivial combination of values from both sides, either one being random meaning that the entire group is random…

That said, what about any mechanical system that is designed for 50 years with computer control? At this time, the IoT market assumes low cost throw away things. This is not universal.  Stuff deployed on a light pole is IoT but will not be low cost or throw away. IoT without the ability to upgrade the software is a toy and if it is not a toy there should be repercussions for the vendor.
Case in point that I have (indirect) experience with. The original 747 inertial guidance computer was a GM Delco Magic computer, which in 1960 was transistors and core memory and monitored a gyro stabilized mechanical platform. That computer was operational for ~40 years before it was replaced by a more “current” inertial guidance computer using solid state sensors. The reason it was replaces was not the obsolescence of the computer, but the sensitivity of the gyro stabilized platform. During that time, the boards were replaced with newer technology while maintaining the same board level functionality. Another important point is that there has never been a commercial crypto system that has lasted more than ~40 years (Vernon cipher aside).

Block ciphers are indeed random permutations. Yes, for a given key k there is usually one element where e_k(x)=x. AES is not a very approachable block cipher to teach.

The 32bit block version of Simon is trivial to explore the cycles.
Another teaching point could be to replace Simon's single & in the round function with xor to create an algorithm (I call SimpleSimon) that is not secure. Retains all the diffusion but none of the confusion.

OFB does feed back. OFB mode also takes in the plaintext. If the plaintext is any constant, then the system will eventually cycle. Roughly, It is a 50/50 chance if it is shorter by at least 1 bit. 25/75 by 2 bits, down to 2^{-128} that it is only 1 cycle. Sure if you use a this PRNG once, it is ?good enough?, but if you deploy this in a system that has billions of PRNGs running independently, the probability of at least one of them getting a short cycle is real. Yes, counter mode repeats at the block size 2^128 and never before. Again, if there are billions of people using your PRNG independently, the possibility that two are using the same seed (you call a nonce) is real (which is similar to repeated hash). The cycling with the hash function is also possible but the block sizes are larger. Bringing this back to your question? OCB showed as Weak random. I am suggesting the cycle you were in may have had some bias. Change the key and you will be in a different cycle. (You are in a cycle even if you never get all the way through.) This is why the Hash works and OCB does not.
Read the NIST recommendations . For instance, Hash, HMAC and CTR are recommended, OFB and CBC are not. It also suggests reseeding the CTR_PRNG and HASH_PRNG after 2^{48} reads. Maybe the best recommendation is to use the OS supplied recommendations for cryptographically secure random numbers.
