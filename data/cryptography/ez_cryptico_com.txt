@_subject: Chasing the Rabbit - a cryptanalytic contest 
Hi all!
At the rump session of Crypto 2006, we started the "chasing the Rabbit"
contest. Dan Bernstein was so kind as to present the slides on our
behalf. The details of the contest are given below; they can also be
downloaded from Best regards

Chasing the Rabbit - a cryptanalytic contest
At the workshop on Fast Software Encryption (FSE) 2003, the stream
cipher Rabbit was presented for the first time. It used a novel approach
for pseudo-random output generation and provided very high performance.
Now, 3 1/2 years later, Rabbit is still unbroken. Starting from August 1, 2006, Cryptico A/S starts the Rabbit contest.
The purpose is to encourage further research and analysis, but also the
publication of already existing results. For the most interesting paper
on Rabbit cryptanalysis, Cryptico A/S offers a price of US $ 1000. In order to qualify for the competition, a paper has to meet the
following conditions:
- At least part of the paper deals with cryptanalysis of the Rabbit
stream cipher. - Cryptanalysis may be of the full cipher, of a reduced version, or of
cipher components. - The paper has been accepted for presentation at a cryptographic
conference with fully reviewed proceedings (either online or printed),
or for publication in an academic journal of good standing. - Cryptico A/S has been notified about the paper's existence and the
conference or journal it has been accepted for. The closing date of the competition is September 30, 2007. After that
date, the Cryptico jury will decide on which paper it considers to be
the most interesting. We preserve the right to split the price money
between several contestants, if this seems most appropriate. Closing remarks:
- Employees, former employees, and advisory board members of Cryptico
A/S may not participate. - The specification of the Rabbit stream cipher and the white papers on
cryptanalysis are available from the Cryptico homepage,
- For any questions or comments, please contact info at cryptico.com.

@_subject: Entropy Definition (was Re: passphrases with more than 160 bits of entropy) 
It's entirely correct that entropy is the wrong measure here, but
the question is how a good measure would look like. Assume that you have a sample space with N elements and an intelligent attacker (i.e., one that tries the most probable elements first). Then what you actually are interested in is that the attacker's probability of success after q sampling attempts is as close as possible to the lowest possible, namely q * 2^{-N}. A natural way of measuring this seems to be some kind of distance between Pr[succ after q samples] and the ideal function q * 2^{-N}. Such a measure might allow a designer
to decide whether a non-perfect distribution is still "acceptable" or
simply "far out". Is anyone aware of whether (and where) this was discussed in the literature, or what other approaches are taken?

@_subject: RSA conference 
Hi all!
Has anyone heard any new about the RSA conference US 2007?
The notification of authors should have been in August, now we are in
the second half of September without having heard anything from the
organizers. At the same time, their mail server keeps rejecting all mails that are
sent to the RSA conference addresses info at rsaconference.com and
callforpapers at rsaconference.com. Since these are the only contact
options offered, the conference organizers basically can not be reached.
For a minor conference, I would consider this to be a very bad sign, but
since this is RSA conference, I assume that things go as planned. Has
anyone heard about problems or delays in organizing the conference?

@_subject: RSA conference 
thanks for your mail, but my concern was in fact the main RSA
conference. Might be though that the crypto mailing list is the wrong
place to ask that kind of question...
