@_subject: Propping up SHA-1 (or MD5) 
I think this construction doesn't provide any additional security. If
someone manages to find x1 and x2 such that H(x1)=H(x2), he will have also
broken H'(X).
If you get h=H(x1)=H(x2) (of course we are talking about hash functions
using the same iterative model as SHA-1), then you would end calculating
H(H(x1 || h) || h) vs H(H(x2 || h) || h), but since both x1 and x2 leave the
internal state of the hash function the same, H(x1 || h) = H(x2 || h) and
hence H'(x1) = H'(x2)
