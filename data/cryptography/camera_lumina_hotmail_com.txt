@_subject: EU seeks quantum cryptography response to Echelon 
Boondoggle. A solution in search of a problem:
"Monyk believes there will be a global market of several million users once
a workable solution has been developed. A political decision will have to
be taken as to who those users will be in order to prevent terrorists and
criminals from taking advantage of the completely secure communication
network, he said."
Silliness itself, at this point. Practical quantum cryptography at this point is limited to transmission. The moment it goes O/E, it's as vulnerable as any other data. And terrorists aren't going to bother splicing fiber.
Of course, primitive quantum storage (with error correcting codes!) is possible and done in laboratories, but we're talking tens of bits here. It'll be a decade before quantum storage is practical, and that's only IF someone can find a convincing reason to start developing it.
