The last time I checked FIPS certification of Banking HSMs (Hardware Security Modules) _only_ covered the loading
of vendor certified software into the module.  In other words, the HSM was only certified to be able to securely
load vendor certified software.  There was no implicit or explicit guarantee that the thereupon loaded software
could be relied upon to operate securely.

Absolutely. Kahn is THE Classic. Read him before Schneier. Both are great writers.

No disrespect! Both are absolutely breathtakingly groundbreaking.

Both the USA & USSR relied on keeping rotor wirings for the KL-7 and the
FIALKA secret, the USSR less so, since theirs never changed, and the USA
more so, since theirs did on a regular basis.
We know that the USSR regularly obtained at least some of the USA Naval
KL-7 wirings through the John Walker spy ring.  We don?t know what those
were.  To this day we have no public knowledge of any actual KL-7 wiring
subnet sets.
We have no evidence that the USA ever had similar cognizance of any USSR
subnet wirings at the time, though perhaps since we do know the wirings of
the fixed Hungarian, Czechoslovakian and Polish FIALKA suggests they did.

So the immediate lesson learned is that Kerckhoff?s principle is alive & well?
Relying on the secrecy of the method is a fatal mistake, one the NSA apparently
blithely committed from 1949 through the early 1980s with its KL-7 device.
The much more important lesson is that key management matters far more than
any crypto itself, at least for symmetric crypto.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Regarding LUCIFER 
Recently I sent a Letter to the Editor of CRYPTOLOGIA.
Here is my letter, followed by his response.
===== My Letter
Dear Craig Bauer,
LETTER TO THE EDITOR OF CRYPTOLOGIA
Dear Editor,
In regards to LUCIFER.
In 1984 Dr. Arthur Sorkin published in CRYPTOLOGIA [1][2] the first
available description of IBM's LUCIFER algorithm, widely considered
to be the direct historical precedent of the Data Encryption Standard.
For whatever reason, in those times things were perhaps felt to be
self evident.  In any event, Dr.Sorkin did not publish any test vectors
or triples of key, plain & ciphertext with which to verify anyone's
(let alone his own) implementation of the FORTRAN program that you
published for him at that time.  Early days indeed!
Below please find what I believe to be representative sets of triples
for Dr.Sorkin?s FORTRAN implementation of LUCIFER, as published by
CRYPTOLOGIA in 1984, based upon my own contemporaneous C language
versions of Dr.Sorkin's FORTRAN programs.

How do I know they are right?  I don't.  Absent any readily
available published triple, what I did was to ensure that the
FORTRAN published in CRYPTOLOGIA could in fact be compiled;
then execute it to obtain results; and then check those results
against those of the C programs I wrote to validate Dr.Sorkin's
work, as published in CRYPTOLOGIA in 1984, 30 years ago.  That
used to be the way one went about such things.
If you think your readership might also be interested in some
of my hideously 30 year old C programs (albeit a bit freshened
up for modern compilers), please let me know.
It would not be the first time that source code for LUCIFER
has appeared in CRYPTOLOGIA.
Yours faithfully,
Richard Outerbridge

===== His Response
Dear Mr Outerbridge:
I regret to inform you that our reviewers have now considered your
paper but unfortunately feel it unsuitable for publication in
Cryptologia. For your information I attach the reviewer comments at
the bottom of this email.  I hope you will find them to be
constructive and helpful. You are of course now free to submit the
paper elsewhere should you choose to do so.
Thank you for considering Cryptologia. I hope the outcome of this
specific submission will not discourage you from the submission of
future manuscripts.
Sincerely, Craig Bauer Editor in Chief, Cryptologia [email]

Comments to the Author
While historical cryptographic protocols are of interest and LUCIFER
is therefore a suitable topic, this note is of little minimal
Editor's comment - I'm very interested in pre-Lucifer digital
systems, if you have anything not already in the literature to
offer! The transitional era between machine ciphers and digital
ciphers has been barely explored!

gender inappropriately known, ”The Five Sisters”)?

Note that the nine digit Canadian SIN (also the American one?) incorporates a one digit LUN check digit (like most if not all credit card numbers).
You had to really protest hard against providing your SIN when opening a Bank account, to the extent of sending the Teller to their Manager.
Eventually you could fill in their forms with ”999 999 999” if you were adamant.  Don’t know what it’s like these daze.

Fine.  I shall.
As regards 1), so far as known, probably provably impossible.
As regards 2), so why bother?  Why not let them take their desperate secrets to their Graves?
As regards 3), such deep state as exists only serves its current Political Masters.
Any further questions?
Too true.

Yeah, unauthenticated timestamps are legally meaningless, because they are
so easily forged. At best an aide de memoire.  How, or whom, best to trust time?
Always remember that the higher one goes, the slower time seems to become.

Yeah, I use a different PIN for every plastic card I own (well, their Issuers claim
they actually ”own” them), and to keep track I write a mangled (simple crypto)
version on every one.  Would I be liable for misuse?  Probably.  Am I worried?

Not only that, but the weather code they captured led to the breaking of SHARK, four rotor ENIGMA,
due to the idempotent setting built into SHARK in order to send & receive the weather code messages.

At least, that?s the rumor I last heard.  And that American Army Officers were under standing orders to
destroy with a hand grenade any suspected captured ENIGMA device during the end game of WW2.
