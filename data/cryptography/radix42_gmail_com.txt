And my appologies to Ben Laurie and friends, but why after all these

accepting a key for the first time as overriding using a different one
when it changed on the other end, whether from mitm or just a

Holy water indeed!  As at least someone on this list doesn't seem to
see that there is a 'too many true names' problem, here are some
examples from the ssl sites I use (almost) daily.  Second level
domains changed to protect the guilty (and url's chopped for safety):
1) Bank number one: This looks ok at first, as the host name is always the same.  However,
if one goes right to this url by typing it in directly, you are
directed back to  which is of course
the perfect place to hijack things with a MITM attack.  Also, the user
visible url once logged in is always nice, short, and sweet, with all
crypto-like parameters safely hidden from the users eyes in POST form
2) Bank number two:  system.com/
This one may or may not have something different from onlineeast3,
depending on, well, who can tell from where the user is sitting?  But
it also does not let one log in directly by typing in the url that is
used in the secure part of the session, similarly to the normal
merchant practice as poiinted out by lynn at garlic.com.  One would hope
that the banks would close this hole for phishing, but alas in these
cases, no.
3) Web mail number one: Of course trying to log into  gives a
certificate error dialog box, although a user normally types in
 for a 'normal' login.  The ssl version of the
same url redirects you to an https url that starts with something
completely different.  And while normall static for long periods, the
f509 part merely indicates the mail store machine your box just
coincidentally happens to be on.  I have (once) seen that change for
my account. When will that happen again, when they most my mailbox, or
when I get subjected to a MITM attack?
4)  also suffers from various "oh you typed in
the https version of an otherwise valid hostname" certificate dialog
boxes, but at least the hostnames don't change dynamically.  Still
cold comfort if I'm out in the wilds checking my mail from somewhere
weird, as I don't carry the fingerprint of their genuine certs in my
wallet or anything.  Hm, maybe I should?
I think that those examples pretty clearly demonstrate the limited
value of any sort of 'true hostnames' in a web ssl context.  Sorry for
running off at the fingers without checking about this issue and ssh
certs earlier, but these ssl examples are directly cut and pasted from
live ssl sessions.  What a mess, and again, holy water indeed!

There have been several long threads over on the cap-talk list the
last few weeks about what to call (still not fully baked) web
capability pointers such as WideWords and httpsy urls.
The point in those discussions that I think is most relevant to this
thread is the fact that there was only a very minor side discussion
about the fact that all of these techniques for granting more fine
grained permissions on the Web that are in the R&D stage use SSL/TLS,
but not PKI, and would very often toss up a certificate warning if you
didn't pay the "cert tax".  The point was made that users have been so
conditioned to ignore them or click on Ok in general, that that itself
was not the biggest barrier to their (potential) future wide
deployment, at least not in relation to other UI issues for their use.

I'd agree, as I was in just this position in the last week or so: I got a gpg encryped email from someone I had no key for, and I haven't cut or circulated one in a very long while (my bad, as it were, on the latter point). So what's the point in even getting a key from them at that point, after the fact? They ARE not many 'hops' away from me in a web of trust sense so far as knowing people in person, but without having keys exchanged ahead of time, its all moot. As I'm sure this list already knows. Just re-iterating the point made here in various ways that key exchange is THE big problem in all of this.

the following 'failure modes', either from the user's browser now warning
or refusing to connect to a server using an insecure cipher suite, or when
the only cipher suites used by a server weren't supported by an old browser
(or both at once):
1) for sites that had low barriers to switching, loss of traffic/customers
to sites that didn't drop the insecure ciphersuites
2) for sites that are harder to leave (your bank, google/facebook level
sticky public ones [less common]), large increases in calls to support,
with large costs for the business. Non-PCI compliant businesses taking CC

Having the key identifier to the left of the untagged local-part is a nice

see if there was a local-part tag delimiter. This could easy auto-mated

Arrgh,
Sometime in the last two months I described the somewhat widespread issue
at VM hosting/cloud providers of provisioning VM's with the same
get run at image generation, and then the urandom seed is frozen in amber,
as it were, in the VM image template file. It is a fairly trivial fix to
re-seed it from /dev/random (one line in the right place).
The obvious place to do that, when the VM is actually provisioned, ends up
hurting deployment time due to sometimes blocking on /dev/random reads to
re-seed /dev/urandom. This has led people to toss up their hands and do the
Wrong Thing of just provisioning, sometimes thousands, of VM's with the
same /dev/urandom seed.
Quequeing up pre-provisioned system images with the one liner to re-seed
related config can happen here, too) takes care of it, but then you get
people whining about shuffling around image files rather than quick copy on
write delployments of VM images.
Then someone at that provider has to realize you just do the queueing
per-storage system used by each hypervisor host against copy-on-write
images. This chain of logic and refinements thereto have not, to my
knowledge, been written up in any widely known best practices document. I'd
love to be shown somewhere they have to point people at if it exists.

So all that would be needed is for your local Older Brother to get the

pre-configured to send either local LAN switchport traffic or mirror your
WAN traffic. It's a config option, no subversion needed. My past life in

@_subject: [Cryptography] What's a Plausible Attack On Random Number 
Your datacenter description is a pretty good match for what I've seen in
the last 10+ years for decently high-end facilities. The main flaw I can
see is in using the network for entropy on boot up, especially on first
boot. As there are quite a few services starting up that need good random
numbers in most systems, you are as you say going to wait a while to grab
enough entropy. Your entropy collection is going to have to start so early
in the boot process that you aren't going to be sending out much, if any,
network traffic, and are not going to be getting much of it.
You need to wait to start up any services that use encryption of any kind,
and which use it you can't know about ahead of time, so you need to start
before pretty much anything else. Which means before all the things that
might send out network traffic.
Listening promiscuously is NOT going to help, as you're going to be on a
dedicated switch port. The only thing to listen to is the switch. Maybe
some arp packets or similar??
Sticking a transparent bridge machine between a system being measured and a
switch port and sniffing everything travelling between them would let you
see what network traffic you get in a real world install and first boot
"First boot" really refers to "first post-install boot", and is one of the
lowest entropy points in a systems life-cycle. If you start collecting
entropy during the installation, when lots of network packets are likely to
be flying around, and save the RNG state so that it has a decent amount of
entropy saved on "first boot". If your install process sucks down your
entropy pool, you might not have much to save, and you'd have to save the
amount of entropy estimated remaining when you saved it's state.

If I recall the most recent revision, the above requirement is true
for keyed hashes whether they are "signatures" with public-key crypto
or "secret hashes" with private-key crypto) but not for "fingerprint"
or unkeyed hashes like FIPS or SHA-XXX.
The distinction among the three types:
"Signature" hashes:  Alice produces a "signature" hash using her
private key.  Because her public key is common knowledge, everybody
can tell that Alice (or at least someone with her private key)
really did sign it.
"Secret" hashes:  MIB or some similar group share knowledge of a
secret key.  A, a member of the group, produces a secret hash
using that key, and when they check, every member from Bea to Zed
knows know that some member of the organization (or at least
someone who has the secret key) did sign it. But even if the
message and hash are public or in an insecure channel like email,
nobody who doesn't have the key can prove a thing about the
signer. Or at least, not from the signature itself.  Server logs
and "security" video surveillence of public terminals etc, are
an entirely different thing. A would be worried about those
if she had an official "identity" for someone to find.
"Fingerprint" hashes:  Anybody can apply a fingerprint hash to
something, and it proves nothing about who signed it because
the hash is completely public knowledge and has no particular
key. Anyone who applies a fingerprint hash to something will get
exactly the same hash code for the same thing. The point of a
fingerprint hash is that it is a fixed-length probably-unique
identifier that can be checked in constant time.  If the
fingerprint of two documents are not equal, the documents are
guaranteed to be dissimilar.  If the documents are dissimilar,
the signatures are *almost* guaranteed to be dissimilar.  This
is very useful for looking up documents in a hash table or
tree, for example, using the fingerprint hash as a key.
Usually when cryptographers use the word "hash" they are
talking about a fingerprint hash.

Stop, you're both right. Really simplistic low end phishing attempts don't
do anything other than capture your credentials, and may or may not
redirect you to where you thought you were after getting them. High end,
more sophisticated ones do a full, live MITM and proxy between you and the
bank, while mimicking the UI.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Swift and cryptography 
Swift currently seems to wrap (nearly) all the current Objective-C types,
classes and libraries. If you go searching through all the Apple iOS
developer docs, you now will see options to show docs for Swift,
Objective-C or All, much like how MS has all the class library docs for
VisualStudio arranged similarly. And all those things with the "NS" prefix,
which are legion, date back to the NextStep era of the late 1980's. Big
legacy security footprint.

@_subject: [Cryptography] [cryptography] the Zcash Open Source Miner 
I just finished my port of Zcash to Mac OS X on Nov 3 (see:
 ) and agree that a mailing list
hosted by the Linux Foundation would be ideal. However I wouldn't
shutter the zcash forum: a user there contributed a patch to libsnark
to work around the lack of ::clock_gettime in Darwin/OS X that made
the rest of the port possible, and is where I connected with an
Ethereum Core developer who contributed a patch set that removed the
final few issues I was grappling with. But a proper mailing list for
core engineering work is indeed desirable.
