The inability to constrain trust anchors doesn't help matters much either.

A user is likely to know when they are clicking around sites like
 and when they are banking, or checking
medical records, or shopping, etc. A part of the problem is the attempt to
try to provide a single solution for all cases. Enabling a user to change
their posture to align with what they are doing may help.

Generate a key pair on your device,
display public key as a QR code,
take a picture of that with another device to share the key elsewhere,
encrypt data for the device using the key and encode as QR or series of
QRs to transfer data to the device,
enter data via camera on your non-phone android,
keep QR with your encrypted passphrase on you for convenient entry,
if you want it to know who you are, sign or MAC you QRs and verify with a
key you loaded similarly.

You do not have to decode and re-encode. You can parse enough to verify
the signature then continue parsing the TBSCertificate structure. I tend
to doubt many implementations re-encode because that will fail too often
if you try that approach. I am curious, has anyone ever seen a certificate
that was presented with a BER encoded TBSCertificate structure that
required DER re-encoding to verify? I have not, but I have seen structures
that will not verify if you re-encode.

As you know, that's easier said than done. Having good test suites like
the old NISCC test suites to aid developers would be an easier landing
spot.
