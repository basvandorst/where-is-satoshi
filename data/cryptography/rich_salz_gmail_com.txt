I don't think you need all that much to get good secure private email.
 You need a client that can make PEM pretty seamless; reduce it to a
button that says "encrypt when possible."  You need the client to be
able to generate a keypair, upload the public half, and pull down
(seamlessly) recipient public keys.  You need a server to store and
return those keys. You need an installed base to kickstart the network
Who has that?  Apple certainly; Microsoft could; Google perhaps
(although not reading email is against their business model). Maybe
even the FB API.
It's not perfect -- seems to me the biggest weakness is (a) the client
could double-encrypt for TLA's to read, or (b) it could give you the
wrong key so your mail only goes to the bad guy -- but it's a hell of
a lot better than we have now and I'd say it's more than good enough.

I wasn't trying to be PRISM proof, hence my subject line.  The client
and keyserver could help thwart traffic analysis by returning a few
"extra" keys on each request. The client then sends a structure
message to some of those keys that the receiving client recognizes and
So what? Your content might get sent to the wrong person, but that can
be avoided with that old PKI favorite, out of band verification.  If
it's necessary.
No it doesn't.  Not by orders of magnitude compared to the few I
mentioned. Nor does it have a mail client last I checked.  (I guess
Chrome doesn't either, but that could be fixed with a couple of quick,
and silent, updates.)
I never said it was new.  The combination of size of the populace
using an out of the box mail client that has this happen seamlessly,
however, would be new.
Do you really think that for most people on the planet, that it is?
Hey folks, go off and design your perfect secure system. Build a
prototype or alpha-test even. And then watch while the millions of
people who could benefit from private email, and the few who could use
it as an infrastructure to build more services, ignore you.  Sigh.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Snowden "fabricated digital keys" to get access 
A lawyer or other (paid) confidant was given instructions that would
disclose the key.  "Do this if something happens to me."
It doesn't have to be an on-line mechanism.

That strikes me as an overly-conservative reading of the rules, but
it's been some time since I was involved in this stuff.  After all,
there is no key in a hash function. Notification was required for open
source, or a commodity classification for a product that had general
encryption facilities.
If the notification for hash is (still?) required, I believe you can
do it now via a simple phone call. To anyone.       /r$

I still think you are reading it too conservatively.  The NSA page
defers the actual rules to somewhere else:  "Certain commercial IA and
IA-enabled IT products that contain cryptography and the technical
data regarding them are subject to Federal Government export controls"
Suite B includes algorithms (encryption) that are definitely
export-controlled.  Most think it also contains algorithms that are
NOT export-controlled (digest).  A Suite B implementation, which would
include encryption, is controlled. A partial implementation, such as
only the digests.. not proven.
