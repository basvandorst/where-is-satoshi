@_subject: [Cryptography] an associative hash function 
Hi everyone,
If you are interested in hash functions or data structures, I wrote a short
paper ( you might like on
associative hash functions. An associative hash function is a hash function
that allows you to efficiently calculate hash(concat(a, b)) from hash(a)
and hash(b). In the paper, I describe how to build an associative hash
function from history-independent data structures.
There is a small catch, as the associative hash function described has an
output that grows in size as O(log n), instead of the O(1) delivered by SHA
et al. That is, for now, the price to pay for associativity.

Like the abstract says, the hash function is based on a Merkle hash. The
key issue the paper addresses is what shape to use for the underlying
Merkle tree. Most underlying trees are not suitable for concatenation.
For example, the tree used in Bitcoin to compute the hash over transactions
in a block is a full binary tree. Those full binary trees support efficient
appends on the right side, but do not support efficient prepends.
The problem is the rigid shape of such trees: In a full Merkle binary tree,
the first and second node always share the same parent, the third and
fourth share the same parent, and so forth. Maintaining that structure is
hard when you prepend a new element, as after prepending all indices
change. What used to be the first node is now the second, and the second
became the third, and so forth. That means that all parent nodes are now in
the wrong place and need to move. But moving nodes means that their hashes
change, and so if you use the wrong tree, concatenation can require
computing O(n) hashes -- not efficient at all.
