I think it's likely that an anonymity server was given special attention
by the FBI.  If the story's accurate this guy probably put himself at
greater risk by using one.
The crook demands a text message sent to a widely-carried newsgroup.
This can be noted down in an internet cafe while viewing it via google.
To say nothing of the fact that distribution of the card secret is desirable.
Risk of apprehension at an ATM could be reduced (at a cost in other risks)
by manufacturing numerous cards and posting them (smartly presented) to
random people as a supposed offer.
    Your card has been approved - withdrawals from your account are
    interest free for the first month.
The flood of people emptying ATMs over a wide area should keep Plod busy.
Or demo one card in a cut+choose manner and sell the rest to a crook
who doesn't know you.  He then carries the risk of visiting ATMs (and the
weight of e200,000).
The sum involved is funny.  It's not enough to be a once-in-a-lifetime
big crime unless he's trying to get out (once) from e150,000 debt.
But what do I know ?  I'm still working.

How confident are you this will be possible ?  Why do you think the
remote attestation traffic won't be passed in a widespread service
like HTTP - or even be steganographic ?
