@_subject: [Cryptography] NSA looking for quantum-computing resistant 
I read this article and as a non-expert in quantum computing, I'm wondering
what sort of impact quantum computing will have on our encryption. Will it
just make brute forcing easier, thus requiring certificates to have a
shorter shelf life? Or is it something more worrying? Less worrying?

Rules aren't there for rulers.
We cannot accept any magic piece of paper as a form of restriction on the
state. As Lysander Spooner put it...
is certain - that it has either authorized such a government as we have
had, or has been powerless to prevent it. In either case, it is unfit to
Trust is the problem. Kill trust, use math. It's an old horse.
How are we going to fight legislation?
I think we should actively undermine it.
When they can encryption, everyone that uses  encryption becomes a
criminal. It makes sense, therefore, to use whatever tactics necessary to
ensure that under that system, everyone is a criminal, and that the law is
Or at least make it so that there is so much random data being passed
around that it is impossible to determine what is encrypted communication
and what is just chaff.

I've been in charge of an account or two that have originally been put on
blockchain.info wallets. I need to move them off. What do you guys think is
the best way to have a small organization use bitcoin, securely, but in a
way that still allows several non technical peers to remain in the loop?

CGPGrey - Should all locks have keys? Phones, Castles, Encryption, and You.
I like this video for a few reasons, it explains why cryptography is
important and why backdoors are bad in layman terms without actually going
into how cryptography works. I'm happy to see a lot of discussion on
cryptography taking place all over the internet, and that young people are
very interested in the technology.
I'm slightly concerned that "encrypted" without ant qualifiers might be
used as a magic word to convince people that something is trustworthy.

Well *that's* interesting.
I wonder what organizations are assisting in this? I also wonder what
organizations exist to help with this sort of thin. It might behoove
people in the area to distribute some encryption software at the event...
Gpg and the like.

I suggest OpenCubic Player. As far as I know, it does not chat with
them internets. It's terminal-based but rather easy to use.
I use it over SSH to play music through my good speakers (which are in
the living room).

I am really only a member of this mailing list because of Bitcoin.
I also happen to live in a very pro-bitcoin area, we have Bitcoin ATM
machines, we have meetup groups for bitcoin users and developers, we
have a large amount of local businesses that accept bitcoin.
Bitcoin is getting there.
Paying for things with bitcoin is almost as easy now as using debit or
credit cards.
A lot of technology and software is developing in the field.
All the features that John has mentioned are relatively new, or
relatively dangerous, advancements in the world of fiat. Central banks
are an economic disaster, causing more problems than they are worth,
and have been repeatedly killed (only to be later resurrected) in the
United States and abroad because of the problems they cause.
Standardized interest rates, as opposed to market interest rates, are
often set too low, leading to price distortion and resource
misallocation. Reversing fraudulent transactions is also relatively
new, and was never a feature built-in to cash.
I suggest, if you're interested in Bitcoin, go buy a bit, maybe 10
dollars worth or something. Try to use it. There's a lot to Bitcoin,
but it's getting to the point where you don't *need* to know *how* it
works in order to use it, which is a major hurdle to overcome if we
want mass-market adoption.

It makes sense, the government has always viewed encryption as the
enemy, and of course the president is going to embody that viewpoints.
It's too much of a threat to their existing powers, and is capable of
extremely limiting them, which they do not want.

That's what I'm most interested in. I'd like to see exactly how the crypto
gets broken. It could serve a good lesson: not even crypto made by
artificial intelligence is safe if self rolled.

That seems like a losing battle, if he decides to transflood the chain,
can't the fork simply ignore that chain? Also, the more he does this,  the
more money he loses to trx fees, so wouldn't he just be throwing money in
the garbage, and exacerbating the blockspace shortage, by doing so? It
seems that if he did that, it would congest blocks massively, and as a
result encourage adoption of any disagreeable fork that provides larger
block sizes.
