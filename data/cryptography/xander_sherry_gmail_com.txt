@_subject: [Cryptography] 2nd Amendment Case for the Right to Bear Crypto 
I believe it is a mischaracterization to to try to equate crypto with a
firearm.  As muntions go, crypto is *not* like a firearm.
The definition of munition is exceptionally broad, ranging from the weapons
used to execute war, to anything that may be used to sustain and maintain
waging war.  Under this broad definition, crypto is indeed arguably a
munition.   So, arguably, is oil.  And food.  And water. However, there is
is definite line between weapons like firearms, or artillery shells, or
nuclear weapons and crypto. The former are useful when employed to actively
attack and harm an enemy.  A stun gun, as was an example in the article is
also used in this way.  Crypto is not. Crypto is designed to be used to
protect *against* harm from an enemy, more like body armor, or an armored
car.  In the software world, it would be reasonable, possibly, to compare
an exploit to a weapon like a firearm.  Or more of a stretch, a DDoS
vector, perhaps.
To argue for 2nd Amendment protections for crypto, however, is to buy into
the argument that it is indeed a weapon that is designed and intended to be
most effectively used for harm (even in defense) and that simply is not the
case.  The additional confusion that would be caused by accepting that
position and advocating for the rights of crypto-the-weapon might well do
more harm than good.
