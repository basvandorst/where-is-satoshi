not really. however Privacy Rights Clearinghouse reports that
100,000,000 personal records have ended up in criminal hands since
2005. See:
  That does not mean 100 million people have become victims of identity
theft. And there is no reason to believe that these records have ended
someone's hand who plans to abuse them.
But with US population of 295,734,134 (CIA numbers) there is good

Hello All,

If two products have exactly same feature set, but one is FIPS 140-2
Level 1 certified but cost twice. Would you go for it, considering the

I don't understand this statement. What do you mean by internet
protocol vs proprietary protocol???
And also we are looking at FDE solutions, so there are no internet
protocols involved in that.
well I think FIPS 140-2 Level 1 ensures more than just a good PRNG.
Even if a public crypto (e.g. AES) is used in a product, there are
many mistakes that can be made during the implementation. And FIPS
140-2 Level 1 is expected to catch these egregious mistakes.

Well for one thing, any software based FDE is extremely slow, doubles
the file access times, and is a serious drain on the laptop battery.
See the URL below for a software based FDE benchmark/analysis:
What if the encryption key for the Seagate's HDD can be managed using
TPM, i.e. wrapped, bound and stored on the TPM. The user will just
have to authenticate to the TPM, using a Token or a static password,
then the FDE encryption key will be available to the HDD.... Will this
solve the problem?

@_subject: Can you keep a secret? This encrypted drive can... 
I compile a lot of software on my laptop, and I *certainly notice* the
difference between my office laptop (no encryption) and my travel
laptop (with FDE). The laptops are exactly the same, with the same
image loaded. The only difference is the FDE software that is
installed on the travel laptop.
That is why I did an analysis of various FDE solutions to find the
best one for my needs. The key thing I was interested was that it must
be AES 256, reasonably fast, inexpensive, and offer key recovery in
case of password loss.
The final outcome of the analysis is available @
Compusec is great for home / personal use. It is cheap i.e. $0.00
(Free), and does not slow down the computer as much as the other
products. But that is because it only support 128 bit AES, which is a
major drawback as most enterprise settings require at least 256 bit
AES. Compusec also has a great online support forum where you can get
your questions answered by Compusec employees and other experienced
I ended up purchasing both Utimaco and Pointsec. They are excellent
products. They both support AES 256. The downside is that they are
little bit expensive (Pointsec:$170 ; Utimaco:$200) and slow.
The best thing is they both offer great password / encryption key
recovery capabilities. You can create a recovery disk with both
They also offer password recovery using Challenge / Response sequence,
where the IT Helpdesk can perform a Challenge/Response sequence with
the user to help them recover the password or reset it to a new one.
Off course Challenge/Response password recovery is the NOT most
secure, especially if the user is remote, but you have the option to
disable it on the laptop if you want.

I think one of the problems with Bitlocker is that it is only
available in Vista Business Edition purchased  under MS Software
Assurance (SA). Not many shops have the MS SA. It is also available in
Ultimate but that is way tooo expensive. Also what about non-MS
operating systems?
The other problem is that it lacks any centralized management. If you
are letting TPM manage your Bitlocker keys you still need a TPM
management suite with key backup/restore/transfer/migrate capabilities
in case your computer goes bad.
The third problem is that it is software based encryption, which uses
the main CPU to perform the encryption.

One of the functions provided by the TPM is to wrap/bind and store the
bulk encryption keys. Now let's us say the mother board or the TPM
goes bad on your notebook or you simply want to upgrade the computer.
You need to be able to restore+transfer the information stored in the
TPM to your new computer. This is where you need TPM management suite
that support key backup/restore and transfer.
A large company's (name withheld) strategy regarding TPM was to ignore
it. Not too long ago few key engineers from that company decided that
a TPM enabled encrypted vault would be good place to secure their
documents. Somehow they managed to lock themselves out of the
encrypted vaults (maybe forgotten password / or lost keys). Had that
company not ignored the TPM and instituted a key backup/archive
program, the engineers would have been able to recover their
confidential documents. We can blame the engineers, but at the end of
the day it was the whole company that lost money and valuable design

Dr. Bellovin,
I am not sure I understand this. With FDE, the HDD is unlocked by a
pre-boot kernel (linux). It is not the function of the resident OS to
unlock the drive.
Challenge/Response password recovery, as I understand, is a very
simplified implementation of Secret Sharing. It allows for 2 parties,
in this case the IT HelpDesk and the User, to collaborate and recover
a Secret.
1) Upon forgetting the password, the user calls the Help Desk.
2) The IT Help Desk authenticates the user in the usual ways (e.g.
check office voice mail etc), as the policy dictates.
3) Once authenticated the user give the partial secret to the HelpDesk.
4) The HelpDesk then combine it with the secret they have to produce a
temporary password.
5) The temporary password is then used to unlock the HDD "once", and
new credentials are created.

FDE encrypts the "entire" boot drive, including the OS, kernel and the

Since when did AES-128 become "snake-oil crypto"? How come I missed

"snake-oil crypto"
Closed-source doesn't mean that it is "snake-oil". If that was the
case, the Microsoft's EFS, and Kerberos implementation would be "snake
oil" too.
I think you are mistaken on the definition of "snake-oil crypto".
Snake-oil crypto refers to "New mathematics", "Proprietary

I think you guys are missing the point. The term "Snake-Oil Crypto"

"important" distinction.
I am copying Matt Curtain (who maintains Snake-Oil Crypto FAQ) and
Bruce Schneier so that they can correct me if I am wrong.
We all know that many open crypto algorithms (like kerberos, AES) have
been implemented in sloppy manner in both open-source and close-source
world. Being open source doesn't necessarily mean that the
implementation is secure.
When is the last time you checked the code for the open source app
that you "use", to make sure that it is written properly?

eavesdropping is detected, the key can be discarded.

Using Quantum Crypto to do bulk encryption doesn't make any sense. It
is only useful in key distribution.

This is interesting:
 at google.com
The problem of a mice traveling through a maze is well known. The maze can be represented using a planar graph. We present a variant of the maze. We consider a grid vertex colored planar graph in which an adversary can choose up to t colors and remove all vertices that have these colors and their adjacent edges. We call the grid in which these vertices and adjacent edges are removed a reduced grid. The problem is that a mice must be able to move in the reduced grid from the first row to the last row, and from the first column to the last column, and this for all possible reductions. We present three types of solutions to construct such grids. The efficiency of these solutions is discussed.
The problem finds its origin in the problem of secure multiparty computation. Imagine going to a medical doctor in Iraq who needs to prescribe some medication, which might be counterindicated. The typical solution is to disclose all medical records to the doctor. If secure multiparty computation would be used, the medical doctor in Iraq only learns from the distributed medical databases whether the medication is, or is not, counterindicated. We consider the problem of parties each having a secret belonging to a non-abelian group. The parties want to compute the product of these secrets without leaking anything that does not follow trivially from the product. Our solution is black box, i.e., independent of the non-abelian group. This has applications to threshold block ciphers and post-quantum cryptography. About the Speaker

information, it will compare the simulation against an actual run of
its latest quantum computer, which should be completed in the next few
months. If the figures match up, then D-Wave will have shown that it
really has a quantum machine, silencing skeptics, according to Geordie
Rose, the company's chief technology officer. "
I still don't see how figures matching up prove that what d-wave
developed is a quantum computer. it just proves that it is a faster

I installed TrueCrypt on my laptop and ran some benchmark tests/
Benchmark Results:
1) Easy to use product. Simple clean interface. Very user-friendly!
2) Free and Open Source
3) Multiple Encryption and Hashing algorithm available.
1) Buffered Read and Buffered Transfer Rate was almost halved after
TrueCrypt FDE was enabled :-(.
2) Access Time for large file (250+MB) increased by 11%.
3) The initial encryption of the 120 GB HDD took 2 hours.

@_subject: cold boot attacks on disk encryption 
interesting paper. but i fail to see how this could be "deadly" (as
the author puts it) to the disk encryption products.
This methods requires the computer to be "recently" turned-on and unlocked.
So the only way it would work is that the victim unlocks the disks
i.e. enter their preboot password and turn off the computer and
"immediately" handover (conveniently) the computer to the attacker so
that the attacker remove the DRAM chip and store in nitrogen. And the
attacker has to do all this in less then 2 seconds.... :) If the
attacker is standing right next to the victim, why even let the victim
turn-off the unlocked computer????
Or am I missing something?

@_subject: cold boot attacks on disk encryption 
After thinking about this a bit, i have changed my views on this
attack. i think it is quite easy to perform this attack. i myself have
been in similar situations, where my personal computer could have been
easily compromised by this attack
However, the hardware based encryption solutions like (Seagate FDE)
would easily deter this type of attacks, because in a Seagate FDE
drive the decryption key never gets to the DRAM. The keys always
remain in the Trusted ASIC on the drive.

i think in most cases tamper-resistant is sufficient - provided the
device that can detect an attempt of tampering, and erase itself. DRAM
chips referred to in this attack are not tamper-resistant.

The service looks very user friendly and secure (i.e. if implemented properly)
It is unfortunate that being a security aware company they don't
provide information about the protocols or algorithms. I haven't used
the service either. So I am as clueless as anyone else. But I won't
let that stop me from making some speculations ;-)
Note: The following are pure speculations and wild guesses:
The service seems to incorporate a technology similar to RSA's
passmark to perform mutual authentication i.e. authenticate the client
machine to the server to prevent phishing. In addition, it appears,
they are also utilizing host-proof hosting AJAX paradigm such that
your login information is never sent to the Usable's cloud servers in
Both of these technologies are well-defined and, if implemented
properly, provide reasonable amount of security.

and personal data collection pose a threat to citizens' privacy and
freedom. The committee said that while such surveillance and data
collection could serve legitimate law-enforcement purposes, those
interests should be balanced against privacy concerns, including
Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The committee
also issued specific recommendations that DNA data on individuals be
consolidated to the National DNA Database, and that closed-circuit
television surveillance only be used under strict oversight and where
it has been shown to be effective.

@_subject: New Technology to Make Digital Data Disappear, on Purpose 
The researchers said they had struck upon a unique approach that
relies on ?shattering? an encryption key that is held by neither party
in an e-mail exchange but is widely scattered across a peer-to-peer
file sharing system.
The pieces of the key, small numbers, tend to ?erode? over time as
they gradually fall out of use. To make keys erode, or timeout, Vanish
takes advantage of the structure of a peer-to-peer file system. Such
networks are based on millions of personal computers whose Internet
addresses change as they come and go from the network. This would make
it exceedingly difficult for an eavesdropper or spy to reassemble the
pieces of the key because the key is never held in a single location.
The Vanish technology is applicable to more than just e-mail or other
electronic messages
