@_subject: Significance of Schnorr's "Factoring Integers in Polynomial  Time"? 
I have three brief comments.
1) The main theorem assumes that we can find a vector of length
? \sqrt{2e?} n^b ?_1
In general, this is not possible in polynomial time, esp. for small b.
2) NEW ENUM takes time exponential in n unless b is very small such that n^b is eliminated by rd(L).
3) GSA does not hold in general. So, even if everything else checks out, the argument might break down here.
We need to see the full result to say more. But in the meantime, let's not be afraid ;-)
