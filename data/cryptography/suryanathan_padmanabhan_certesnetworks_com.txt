Is this to be used as a personal key manager?
I believe the important attributes of a key manager is
uses a good PRNG, runs in a hardened environment, etc.
Portability was never considered as a characteristic of a
key manager.
I would never trust a proprietary device and assume they are
safe and not tampered with in any form. If it is for personal use, one
should try an open source hardware board(like beagle) and run a
customized(hardened) *nix on it. Eventually finding  an open source
HSM would also be a good idea.
