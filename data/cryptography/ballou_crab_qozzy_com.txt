These days, the preference is for at least version 1.2 of TLS.? I have
used the following two configuration lines in my Apache2 configuration:
SSLCipherSuite AESGCM:AESCCM:!kRSA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1.2 +TLSv1.3
For what it's worth, Qualys claims to be an "SSL Lab" that offers an
analysis tool at  I have
no idea how reliable the tool actually is, but with the configuration
lines above, my site receives a grade of "A".? (The certificate is
provided by LetsEncrypt.)
