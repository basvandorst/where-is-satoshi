... or in other words, EKMI leaves all of the hard/impossible problems
to be solved by somebody else.  I'd have to agree with Ben that I'm
not seeing the value add of an additional layer of complexity.
That's an interesting presumption that you're making -- are you familiar
with your audience?

I'd turn that question around, and ask what makes now such a bad time to
address an issue that's been present (and not addressed) for quite some
time... ?
Surely the recent DNS fiasco was enough of an illustration of the merits
of not worrying about something that's been a well known issue for ages...

You're thinking at the wrong level.
There are definitely FAQs that are applicable to building a picture
frame, a dining room table, or a covered bridge.
Woodworking FAQs can (and do) exist to teach basic skills, like sawing and measuring wood, different ways to join bits of wood together, and what types of join are most appropriate for what type of task.  Further, there
are discussions about things like load and stress, and what designs and
materials are best suited to what applications.
The same applies for implementing crypto -- teach the building blocks,
issues and judgement points required for good understanding and
Ultimately it doesn't matter if they're building a picture frame, a
dining room table, or a covered bridge, as you've put it -- the skills,
materials and judgement of what to use where are what matters.

That's not entirely true -- even commercial vendors have things like
ongoing support to consider, and some customers just cost more money
than they're worth.

Why should the user care about any of that?  What we -should- be presenting
is something with the equivalent clarity of "Look, there are cars rushing
by my face, -and- the light is red -- perhaps I shouldn't walk across the
road", rather than "you have a blindfold on, and there are some noises
that suggest that you might be able to cross the road in some direction,
but we're going to presume that you already know what they mean, and what's
the best way to actually proceed".
In order to make good (or even tolerable) decisions about acceptable
risk, you have to have enough context to have the faintest clue what sort
of risks you're actually looking at (see also:  "I have a system that
totally works for the stock market!").
I don't have any answers for the 'best' way to approach this, but providing
more technical detail in the absence of well understood grounds for evaluating said detail definitely isn't it.

... except this only works when you're talking about immediate transactions -- and I'd be very, very surprised if there weren't still a fair percentage of delayed transactions.
... and that means that there's likely to be impact to both the card owners and the card acceptors in denied transactions -- or there's going to be some sort of workaround that puts the entire idea into the "nice try, but ..." category.

No -- it's not about disconnecting metering, but still allowing power; if you look at the data sheets for smart meters (eg:   remote service connect/disconnect is one of the features.

FWIW, I had my meter die (short out spectacularly, in fact), and had to
get a new (still dumb) meter.  It was 'exciting'.
