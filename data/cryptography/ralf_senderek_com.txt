I think what's missing is the understanding that there cannot be
secure email without the persons involved acting responsible and knowing their role in the process.
Your mother will probably expect the computer to do the job for her
(mine will never expect anything from computers) rejecting any
responsibility for her email's security. In my opinion establishing
secure email this way is impossible despite the fact that encryption is
(relatively) easy if our algorithms work as expected and you have the
correct high-quality public key.
And even if Instant Messaging systems would use the same crypto people
will use them like cell phones without any consciousness of their own
responsibility for key validation. Getting good crypto into mass products
can help but does not eliminate the necessity for checking essential properties
of the system they use.
How we can make this job as reliable as possible is the question at the heart
of the problem.

@_subject: Time for a second thought about SDLH 
This is simply not true, because we are _not always_ going to sign
megabytes, and SDLH is more than fast enough for sensibly crafted texts.
At the end of the day we might consider the option that we don't need
a single hash function for everything.
There is a place for a high end hash function.
I insist on a second thought.
Kind regards

@_subject: Can you keep a secret? This encrypted drive can... 
Yes and no!
I use dm-crypt on a Linux laptop with FC5.
On the encrypted filesystem:
# > df
# > time dd if=/dev/zero of=cryptogram bs=1MB count=50
50+0 records in
50+0 records out
50000000 bytes (50 MB) copied, 1.96366 seconds, 25.5 MB/s
dd if=/dev/zero of=cryptogram bs=1MB count=50  0.00s user 0.52s system 25%
cpu 2.023 total
On the unencrypted filesystem:
# > time dd if=/dev/zero of=cryptogram bs=1MB count=50
50+0 records in
50+0 records out
50000000 bytes (50 MB) copied, 0.216106 seconds, 231 MB/s
real    0m0.257s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.252s
The factor 9.05 making the the unencrypted filesystem faster than the
encrypted one really does not make a difference for me for anything I do.
I'd be happy with 1 MB/s and I got 25! (using AES-256)
