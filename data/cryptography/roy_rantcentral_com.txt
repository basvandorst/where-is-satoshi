It's slightly more subtle.  The action tag of a form submission isn't usually visible to the user like links are.  In the scam copy I received, all the links save one pointed to legitimate PayPal documents.  Only the <form action= gave it away, and you have to view source to see that.

@_subject: Confessions of a skeptical mind (re: reports that 17-year-old "cracked" al Qaeda "encryption"). 
The research of Provos and others proves, if nothing else, that nothing resembling well-known crypto is stegged.  So either an unknown system was used, or the stegged data has been stripped of its identifying header information. (there was a program to do this with PGP a while back)  Probably at least the latter, because any header information included wouldn't look random, and stego relies on the hidden data to look random.  Any credible crypto algorithm's output is going to look pretty random.  Also, Fardia is quoted as saying the data were triple-encrypted.  So we have someone claiming that, given an arbitrary sample of random-appearing data, he was able to not only recognize the output of an arbitrary crypto algorithm which may or may not be well known, but he was able to similarly recognize and correlate the subsequent output so to infer the repeated encryption.  All for an unnamed "US agency" (perhaps the (NS|CI)A?) which, presumably, was unable to do more than divine the presence of an encrypted message in this data.  And this smoking gun, which would go a long way towards legitimizing the U.S. 's demonization of Al-Qaeda, is only reported in the Hindustan Times.

@_subject: Don't kill the messenger (was: Re: Reliance on Microsoft called risk to U.S. security) 
A small nit: HTML is, in fact, text.  The effects you describe are the result of a client taking certain actions based on the text/html MIME type.  That's the reason you use Pine (and I use Kmail).  These clients (and others... yay, elm!) don't take unbidden actions to render HTML mail or cause executable attachments to execute.
True, but again, that's a property of HTML. That the HTML document was transmitted through mail is a side issue.
It's not that email has been overloaded, through the use of MIME, to carry content other than text/plain.  The problem is that certain MUAs have been built to take some default actions based on the MIME types received, and those clients have become (for whatever reason) popular among mail users of a, shall we say, non-technical bent.
SMTP is *already* such a protocol.  Base-64 encoding (and UUENCODE before it) was designed to address the 7-bit gateway through which email once passed.  MIME only describes and encapsulates non-textual content.  (the first M originally stood for 'multimedia', not 'multipurpose') Some mail clients have evolved (or been designed *cough*outlook*cough*) to be infection vectors, but that's not the fault of the base transport protocol.  It's the result of poor security decisions in the client design process.
This is not to demonize MIME, either.  Some applications, like PGP signatures, are elegant uses. Much better than the X-PGP-Signature header I was helping develop 10 years ago.  There's nothing intrinsically wrong with extending mail to carry arbitrary content.  The problem appears when the MUA is able to take some risky action with that content, whether automatically or through unwise user action.  Grandma clicks on everything.
Mail as a vulnerability is a client issue and a training issue.
That said, I also despise HTML mail for all the reasons you describe.  But between the September That Never Ended and the release of Mosaic, it's really no surprise that eye candy has become an imperative.

Yes!  Speaking from experience, it's far easier to write a C++ wrapper for a C lib than the other way around.  And as Ian said, it's probably
easier to get the implementation correct in C, at least as a first pass.

An infrared-reflective bar code would not be visible to the naked eye.  That would probably slip past the proles for a good while before the word got out.  And once the infrastructure is in place, it would be hard to dislodge.

@_subject: High hopes for unscrambling the vote 
R. A. Hettinga quotes Declan McCullagh:
That's an interesting perspective, considering electronic voting already *is* "something new".  A man with tinfoil inside his fez might wonder if this points to a greater conspiracy that hinges on the lack of a paper trail from the voting machines.
Speaking of which, this[1] Cringely column doesn't seem to have received much notice, even though it points out that the Diebold machines *already have a printer* built in.  While it's probably not equipped to do Chaumian voter receipts, it could certainly do the old-fashioned human-readable type.   That's a SMOP.

I'd thought it was so Microsoft could offer an emulation-based migration
path to all the apps that would be broken by Longhorn.  MS has since
backed off on the new filesystem proposal that would have been the
biggest source of breakage (if rumors of a single-rooted, more *nix-like
filesystem turned out to be true).

Quoting Ian G :
Also noted in Psi.  Google's instructions for Psi say to leave "Use SSL
encryption" and "Allow Plaintext Login" unchecked, but both need to be checked
for me to successfully login.  I'm guessing Google is counting on the SSL
tunnel to protect the plaintext logins.

I'd read it.  More resources == better.  But keep the current Wikipedia
controversy in mind WRT the veracity of the contributed material.  Then
again, if it's a crypto wiki, I suppose we could expect some
credentialing system to be incorporated.  It could even be presented as
a tutorial.

@_subject: Clearing sensitive in-memory data in perl 
Quoting Adam Shostack :
There used to be a fairly standard set of  along this line that were
added to  or some other standard header file.  Something like
 strcpy          DONT_USE_STRCPY
 strncpy         DONT_USE_STRNCPY
 strcat          DONT_USE_STRCAT
 strncat         DONT_USE_STRNCAT
 gets            DONT_USE_GETS
 sprintf         DONT_USE_SPRINTF
I don't think it was standard in any platform, though. More of an ad hoc

It also is only warning against ad-hoc connections with misleading names. While I see a bunch of these around (not necessarily in airports,
either... several show up from my cube at work), it doesn't take much to
put up a perfectly normal-looking access point.  See
