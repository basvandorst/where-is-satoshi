On a sidenote, keep in mind that a success rate of 5/6th is not
nearly good enough to successfully copy (intercept) multiple
photons (bits). 5/6 = 83% per bit gives you (5/6)^8 = 23%
confidence per byte, or (5/6)^16 = 5% for 2 bytes, or even
(5/6)^128 = 7E-9% for 16 bytes which clearly is not as alarming as
the 5/6th look in the first place; real world transmissions would
surely be large enough to get that interception confidence rate
down. On the other hand, that confidence rate may well be expected
to get much better than 5/6th by the time we actually use quantum
crypto in the real world.

Now that I've reread it I realise that an unsuccessful duplication
does not necessarily mean discovery. Which makes my last post look
kinda .. wrong.
