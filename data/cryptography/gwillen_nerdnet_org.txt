Perhaps we're going about this the wrong way. If the machine isn't on the network yet, then it doesn't really need a secure host key. Maybe if we need keys for the configuration process, such as ssh host keys, we should then throw them away and regenerate them (as a one-time process) after configuration is complete? That way the long-term keep-it-for-decades key doesn't have to be the same key we generated at the absolute least-entropy time in the machine's lifecycle.
Honestly, how much would it hurt to do the same thing in the general case? Let ssh generate a host key on first boot, then once the entropy pool fills, throw the key away and generate a new permanent key? There will be a short window during which _maybe possibly_ the key is slightly weak, but we wouldn't be using an all-zeroes key or anything during that time. And the permanent key will be a lot safer for longterm use.

He calls their cryptography 'perfect', but he makes no mention of what block cipher mode they're using, or how they're handling IVs/nonces. Off the top of my head, it seems to me like you could do it securely -- given his description of the trojan's observed behavior -- using AES-CTR or AES-CBC, using a hash of the file's full path for the CTR nonce or the CBC IV. (Alternatively you could use random or sequential nonces, but then you'd have to store the nonce <-> file mapping somewhere, and I didn't see him mention any evidence of that.) If they don't do that, it's probably reusing nonces/IVs, which would make it vulnerable. (Of course, the effort required to use the hypothetical vulnerability to recover a single valuable file probably already exceeds the price they're charging for the key. And forget about using it to recover the entire filesystem.)

@_subject: [Cryptography] PGP Key Signing parties 
I am going to be interested to hear what the rest of the list says about this, because this definitely contradicts what has been presented to me as 'standard practice' for PGP use -- verifying identity using government issued ID, and completely ignoring personal knowledge.
Do you have any insight into what proportion of PGP/GPG users mean their signatures as "personal knowledge" (my preference and evidently yours), versus "government ID" (my perception of the community standard "best practice"), versus "no verification in particular" (my perception of the actual common practice in many cases)?
(In my ideal world, we'd have a machine readable way of indication what sort of verification was performed. Signing policies, not being machine readable or widely used, don't cover this well. There is space for key-value annotations in signature packets, which could help with this if we standardized on some.)
