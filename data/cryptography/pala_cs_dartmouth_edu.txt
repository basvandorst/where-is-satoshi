This approach is MTA-to-MTA... if you want something more MTA-to-MUA,
then you can take a look at this:

you should provide the whole chain starting from the CA that issued the server
cert. Be careful, though, because you should *NOT* provide the root cert
in the chain as well.
Moreover you should use the:
not the SSLCACertificateFile (which is for client auth).

I do not really agree on this statement. There are ongoing projects, that
I know of, that are actually working on maximizing communication throughput
(which is currently not very good) on encrypted channels and minimizing
costs of involved equipment. AFAIK, one great advantage of quantum crypto
is in the area of key-exchange when establishing a secure communication.
I guess quantum crypto is definitely not "fiction" (Anyhow I do not know if
it has already been used somewhere... ).

@_subject: Watermarking... 
Hi all,
I was wondering if any of you have some pointers on the security of
watermarking. In particular I am interested in public-key or asymmetric
watermarking algorithms.
Also, do you know of any free-to-use (opensource/etc.) implementation
that can be used for research-test purposes ?

[Moderator's note: Please no top posting. --Perry]
Hello Sandy, all,
basically what I need is a library that will allow me to check for
a watermark into an image/video/etc. It could be different algorithms
for different media type - my work is not related to the algorithms
The important issues are:
* the algorithm(s) should be based on public key (asymmetric)
* my program should be able to verify that a watermark exists and
    has been generated with a private key corresponding to a specific
    public key
* an attacker should not be able to add a watermark that my app
    would recognize as valid (ie., the verification would fail when
    using my app's public key if an attacker tries to substitute
    the watermark)
* if the watermark is removed/altered/substituted I should be able
    to detect it
* the watermark should be invisible
Do you know if/where can I find some libraries that provides me with
some implementation of one or more algorithms that satisfy my needs ?
I know there are a lot of publications about these algorithms, but
I need a usable (also if not perfect) implementation.. preferably
written in C/C++
