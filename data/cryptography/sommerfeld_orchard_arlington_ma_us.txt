This may also not quite do what you think:
 1) burn_stack() may reasonably be made tail-recursive by a
sufficiently agressive compiler, if the memset is inlined and is then
recognized as a bunch of dead stores.
 2) even if it doesn't get tail-call treatment, some ABI's require
largeish alignment for stack frames or define a fixed component to the
stack frame and then don't fill in the unused stack slots; either of
these may leave a good size chunk of the stack unwritten.

@_subject: Attacking networks using DHCP, DNS - probably doesn't kill DNSSEC  
One key point though: even if DNSSEC was deployed from the root, and a
trusted copy of the root key was the client, the search path/default
domain must *also* come from a trusted source.
Currently, default domain/search path often comes from DHCP, and for
nomadic laptops where the relationship to the local network is often
casual at best, this is likely to be a mistake.

So, what's my reason to accept a "payment in cpu time"?  As best as I
can tell, a "payment in cpu time" means that someone *else* doesn't
get a payment in cpu time with their spam.  I still get the spam.
It seems analagous to a protocol that proves that someone burned a
dollar bill.
A scheme where I actually get something of value might have a bit more

If you believe spammers are beginning to use viruses to deploy spam relays.
If a spammer has a zombie army of a few thousand compromised systems,
the spammer's cpu time costs for hashcash will also essentially be
free.

A skeptic of the above scenario could claim that the "explorer" was
actually a pair of identical twins (one of whom was hiding in the cave
before you entered) rather than a single individual.
One possible defense against this would involve an uncopiable but
verifiable token given to the "first" explorer.

[Moderator's note: With this, I'm ending all baggage messages for

Not necessarily.  I was under the impression that there are also
non-TSA folks (airline-employed baggage handlers) in the
baggage-handling pipeline.

@_subject: Monoculture  
An implementation monoculture is more dangerous than a protocol
Most exploitable security problems arise from implementation errors,
rather than from inherent flaws in the protocol being implemented.
And broad diversity in protocols has a downside from another general
systems security principle: minimization..
The more protocols you need to implement to talk to other systems, the
less time you have to make sure the ones you implement are implemented
well, and the more likely you are to pick up one which has a latent
implementation flaw.
