@_subject: CD shredders, was Re: thoughts on one time pads 
I have an Executive Machines EPS-1501X cross-cut
shredder (15 sheet, I think) which also shreds CDs. And it really shreds them, into about 1/4" x 1"
strips.  It's no louder than any home/office other
shredder I've used, though it is louder when shredding
