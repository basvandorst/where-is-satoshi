@_subject: hedging our bets -- in case SHA-256 turns out to be insecure 
Let me give also some comments on this construction:
C(x) = H1(H1(x) || H2(x))
I am not really sure, but, I think the above construction for C(X) is just as secure as H1.
let y = C(X) = H1(H1(X) || H2(X)) = H1(X') with X' = (X'1 || X'2)
Consider the H1(X') part of the construction. 2^(|H1|+|H2|)-bit inputs are mapped to 2^(|H1|)-bit outputs. This means for every output "y" that are 2^(|
H2|) possible inputs.
Now, consider the probability of the following event:
y = C(K) = H1(H1(K) || H2(K)) = H1(X').
That is
  = Pr[H1(K) = X'1 and H2(K) = X'2]*(2^(|H2|))
  = Pr[H1(K) = X'1] * Pr[ H2(K) = X'2] (since H1 != H2, also independent)
  = 1/2^(|H1|)
Obviously, this is equal to the security level of H1.
