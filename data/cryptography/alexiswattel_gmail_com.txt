That's right. They found a phone in a trash bin with a text message saying "we're on our way, we are starting". It was not encrypted as opposed to iOS 9 devices or certain Android when they're locked. Even though the name and identity of the recipient was unknown, investigators were convinced that this phone has been used by the planner of the attack. Therfore they requested the geolocation informations to follow the lead that may have end up on this morning arrestation. Although this revive the debate on phone encryption, the article notes at the end that the same information could have been obtained from operators even if the phone was encrypted.
