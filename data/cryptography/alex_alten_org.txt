Actually 32 (or even 16) bits is really useful for retrofitting old insecure protocols where you
don't want to alter the header size, you only need access control, and the packets only exist
for less than 100 msecs.

[Moderator's note: I have to strongly disagree. 16 bits is rarely, if
ever, of any use in authentication in a modern system. Even if you
think something can't live long enough to be spoofed, it usually can,

I used PGP (Enterprise edition?) to encrypt my work emails to a distributed set of

What I really hated about it was that when fred at company.com sent me an email
often I couldn't decrypt it.  Why?  Because his firm's email server decided to put
in the FROM field "fred at server.company.com".  Since it didn't match the email
name in his X.509 certificate's DN it wouldn't decrypt the S/MIME attachment.
This also caused problems with replying to his email.  It took us hours, with
several experimental emails sent back and forth, to figure out the root of the problem.

Actually the usability issue has been solved elsewhere too.  We did it over at TriStrata
before the firm crashed in 1998.  We allowed the system security officer to select the
default cipher to use in sending emails (DES, 3DES, Blowfish, RC4, etc.). The receiver
could use any cipher for decrypting incoming email. A sys admin installed some filter
software into the email client, and except for an initial login dialog (and we even simplified
that by hooking the OS login dialog), the user never had to do anything further.  The local
auth keys that he received during enrollment were encrypted with his password on a small
floppy disk, or could be installed on the hard drive automatically.

Because the software needs a unique ID/name to find the correct key to use. In practice (corporate) users can have multiple email names, see my reply to Peter Gutman.  This is not the fault of the email architecture, which has been working fine for 30-40 years, but the fault

@_subject: bounded storage model - why is R organized as 2-d array? 
This is a subject that I'm painfully familiar with.  Dr. Maurer has slowly but surely over the last decade or so been putting together
a solid proof of a cipher very similar in construction to Dr. Atalla's proprietary Tristrata cipher (US patent   The basic idea is that you do something like random1 XOR random2 = pad, then pad XOR
plaintext = ciphertext. If random1 and random2 are arrays of bits (n-bit random numbers) from a much larger amount of random material, then one can tune the probability of the pad repeating to be almost
zero.  Essentially you get an equation with 2 unknowns (pad and plaintext), which is pretty hard to solve if the pad is hard to determine.  The 2-D array simplifies getting the randomX's.  Basically you treat the initial random material as a big array of N random bit strings.  Each randomX value is a random strip inside each bit string. Each strip is the same size (at TriStrata we typically used four 64-Kbyte strips, each from a 250 Kbyte bit string).  You XOR them together and get a "random" pad (ours was 64 Kbytes long).  We were able to XOR about 32 Kbytes of plaintext into
ciphertext, before an inverse matrix attack became feasible.  Then a new pad had to be generated for the next 32 Kbytes.
The reason people like Dr. A or Dr. M are interested in doing this
is because you can get super-fast ciphers or get some sort of fundamental proof about its strength that is applicable to all types
of ciphers.  The speed, from a software engineering perspective, results from the classic tradeoff between memory lookup and execution loop complexity. If one can get down to a couple of XORs and memory
copies (per 32 or 64 bit data)using ordinary microprocessor instructions then it will outperform AES by around a couple of orders
of magnitude. This is very useful for encrypting things like video streams without an expensive hardware cryptographic accelerator card.
Dr. M showed in an earlier paper that if one uses enough randomX values that you can get arbitarily close to generating a truly random
pad each time you need it to encrypt some ciphertext (but with N XORs!).
Anyway, the big negatives are that with this type of Vernam cipher
the entropy decays really fast, especially if the initial big source
of random bits is publicly known, the pad management is really hairy, and generating lots of random bits of the initial material is very slow. Huge numbers of pads have to be generated and distributed all the time, and a great deal of care has to be taken to mitigate the cipher's decaying strength and to avoid several types of attacks on the pad generation.
It is of great personal interest to me to watch Dr. M slowly prove that the underlying mathematics of Dr. A's Tristrata cipher may not have been snake oil after all.

You have to be careful.  I meant in regards to the incremental overhead of
the cipher once the cleartext is loaded from DRAM into L1 cache.  And
the cleartext data is constantly streaming in enough to cause the L1 cache
to be refreshed constantly during the timing test.  Of course if the Vernam
cipher's pad is constantly loading in too, then it's DRAM overhead must
be counted against it.  The best ones tend to place as much of the
original random material as possible in L1 and randomly remix the pads
inside.  It's very tricky, balancing speed against the decay rate of the cipher
(and countering things like partial key attacks).

revocation of users (i.e. preventing a revoked user from using
a key to decrypt/encrypt data), and also to support key recovery
of encrypted data under proper authority (say to comply with
a legal warrant.)
Finally, regardless of your design you must carefully weigh and
assess it's performance, doing the tradeoff between cryptography
and speed and reliability.  And you need to design it to be robust
in the face of operational failure.

It is a HUGE win for designing a crypto system to have a really fast (and good) HW RNG. Being able to generate 10-20,000 AES keys
per second means that you can engineer things that were impossible
to do otherwise.  You can generate as many keys as you like, throw
away keys after one time use, treat them as ephemeral authentication
keys (say give a few million or so to a user), etc. Or you could hand a sender 10 MBytes (less than a minute to generate), which then
can be used to create billions of keys (say using Ueli Maurer's Bounded Storage Model).  The sender could then use each key to uniquely encrypt (AES CTR) each message of a series of messages or
packets to a receiver (AES key setup is fast). No need for an IV or worrying about message ordering (each one has a key id), or even the
compromise of a key or two.
Randomness is the most fundamental underpinning of a crypto system

I agree with these statements.  I have a couple of comments
regarding crypto and IDS.  I think that we will have to move toward
encrypting more data at rest in some manner that is that is easy for
the user to use (like ATM cash cards) yet difficult for a malicious
piece of software on the user's machine to circumvent.  This will
require that all PC's ship with a trusted hardware/firmware chip
AKA a reference monitor on the motherboard that can safely handle
any red keys.  This also means the PC needs a trusted path to
the user like the pin pad in ATM machines.  Many laptops now
ship with fingerprint scanners, so maybe these things are not such
an onerous requirement on PC manufacturers anymore.  Also
the reference monitor could be used to prevent viruses being able
to completely taking over the user's machine (maybe at least
to maintain some sort of host IDS capability).
For IDS, I think we need to think of it in more the context of policing.
These virus writers are human beings, and I suspect for the most
part a very small fraction of the total Internet population.  We need to
have tools and international Interpol-like treaties in place that allow
police to track down and arrest these people (or deny them access
via an ISP or a carrier).  Many of the tier 1 carriers apparently are
refusing to share IDS information with one another.  This needs to
change.  We need really good IDS tools that track down the control
lines of the botnets, etc., back to their actual handlers.  This may
mean that each carrier must archive large amounts of either netflow
data or even raw packets (say for non-TCP traffic) so that detailed
L7 analysis can take place to track botnet control lines back to their
handlers in after-the-fact investigations.  Also, I hate to say this, we
may need to also require that all encrypted traffic allow inspection of
their contents under proper authority (CALEA essentially).  If we
can do this then we can put real policing pressure on these virus
writers, essentially removing them from being able to attack us

Sorry for the long delay in responding, I was traveling out of
"radio range" this week.
Generally any standard encrypted protocols will probably eventually have
to support some sort of CALEA capability. For example, using a Verisign
ICA certificate to do MITM of SSL, or possibly requiring Ebay to provide
some sort of legal access to Skype private keys.  If there is a 2nd layer
of encryption then this would require initial key exchanges that may be
vulnerable to interception or after-the-fact analysis of the decrypted SSL
Well, in order to be useful, codecs need to be well known.  If unknown
then they probably follow well known algorithms and thus probably be
ameniable to dogged digital forensics.
Sure, but then interoperability goes out the window, and I'm pretty sure
that most thieves and attackers are not going to rebuild complex protocol
stacks and textual parsers from scratch.  This is what software reuse is
all about. In the case of botnet control lines then this may be more likely
but it seems to me that once you identify the suspicious packet flows
(which you are of course looking for on the infected machine), that dedicated
forensics analysis can be done successfully.  These packets would probably
have some sort of anomolous signature compared to more normal packets
of the same nature.  Also, don't forget, at the very least L4 signature
information will never be encrypted, otherwise it would be unroutable. And
remember even if you can decrypt the botnet control lines (which still must
do key distribution/exchanges over the same comm links as the victim
computers so it should be possible to intecept them) you can certainly
block them with something like a Cisco guard.
So it's not so clear that the train has even left the station.

These are trite responses.  Of course not.  My point is
that if the criminals are lazy enough to use a standard
security protocol then they can't expect us not to put
something in place to decrypt that traffic at will if necessary.
Yeah and you can only communicate with Allah with
that type of design.
Look, the criminals have to design their security system with
severe disadvantages; they don't own the machines they
attack/take over so they can't control its software/hardware
contents easily, they can't screw around too much with the IP
protocol headers or they lose communications with them, and
they don't have physical access to the slave/owned machines.
And, last I heard, they must obey Kerckhoff's law, despite
using prayers to Allah for key exchanges.
Given all this, I'm not saying its easy to do, but it should be
quite possible to crack open some or all of their encrypted
comms and/or trace back to the original source attack

[Moderator's note: Please don't send giant run on paragraphs to the
list. They're hard to read. --Perry]
A year ago when I took a hard look at the Skype login protocol (via public reverse engineering publications, etc.), I determined that the user id to public key binding was fundamentally weak.  If I remember correctly they were vulnerable to at least one attack, a dictionary attack against a password of a user account is possible using the Skype login client-server messages (they can't tell you are attacking since the account name and password are hashed together in the public key/AES encrypted request and you are using one of the well-known 14+ valid Skype public keys).  Their multiple layering of crypto obscures things but with software one can automate the building of the login request encrypted layers fairly easily.  Once you get a valid user cert from the login attack it looks like that account is permanently compromised (I didn't see any user cert validity period).  Because of Kerckhoff's principles there is really no way Skype can prevent this attack (basically they are using the data channel itself to distribute the user certs (with public & private auth keys) to then establish an enciphered phone session over it).   They also have at least one back door mechanism in place, which could be used to quickly compromise a user password.  They allow a user that forgot their password to have it reset and sent to their enrollment email address so that a Tier 1 IDS like Narus could easily scoop it up (this requires careful social engineering).  Also, any SSL traffic to a Skype server can be MITM intercepted (say via a Bluecoat ProxySG appliance) using a ICA cert from a major CA vendor (or internal corporate CA) and any user passwords could be scooped up that way as well.
Thus a retail level wiretap attack against a particular user is quite possible.  Having said that because the 14+ private Skype keys are (only?) stored on their servers, it does not look like a wholesale attack against the Skype system is easy to do (although they did use MD5 in their login algorithm).  However, given this centralization of Skype keys, they certainly could cooperate with any CALEA warrants, etc., by giving police the user certs to be wiretapped (which still requires an active MITM during the setup handshake of the encrypted channel between the two user end-points).  Of course, if physical theft occurs of the 14+ Skype PKI private keys then the whole security ediface will collapse.

Quoting Peter Gutmann :
I agree with you, having designed and built symmetric key systems in  the past for intra-organization use.  These type of systems had a  centralized key management (and policy adjudication) server for  maximum automation of secure data/session key distribution, which is  great for things like real-time revocation.
How would you propose going about doing it for a globally scalable system?

@_subject: [Cryptography] FW: IAB Statement on Internet Confidentiality 
Hmm...the Reddit posting has had no responses.
On a more serious note, the IAB statement below opens up a whole can of worms.
1. The vast bulk of the Internet protocols now and in the future  already exist. How are we going to retrofit them or somehow deal with  them?  New secure protocols will be a tiny percentage of the installed  base of insecure protocols.
2. You can't just encrypt/authenticate without dealing with key  management, which adds more complexity and state to a protocol and  supporting software. Is the IETF going to design a one-size fits all  key management protocol?
3. You can't just add key management without dealing with policy  adjudication. And you can't adjudicate without a (globally) scalable  way to deal with the identity of humans and programs.  How do we  represent and store policy attributes and rules? Is this beyond the  purview of the IAB? If so, whom does the IAB coordinate with?
4. You can't encrypt without dealing with legal issues, like  supporting judicial warrants for "wire taps". We cannot ignore most  (democratic?) societies' need to investigate crime. (I expect to get  heated flame mail over this point.)
5. You can't successfully secure your comm links if your nodes are  insecure.  At the very least we will need to have operating systems  that support something like a Biba integrity model for processes.  And  to do this we need some sort of Reference Monitor inside each OS.  How  can we do this without hardware support?  And how do we get all the OS  vendors to agree to secure their OS's in manner that supports these  new (and retrofitted) protocols keying and policy needs?

Quoting from the last page of David Kahn's book "The Codebreakers", 1967,
"The war of the cryptographer against cryptanalyst has been won by
the cryptographers.  The only way properly encrypted messages can be
read nowadays is by theft or betrayal--that is, noncryptologic means."
Agreed, now AES is shipping with almost every Intel processor (the AES-NI
instruction set).  The only problem is most programmers don't want to deal
with the extra headache of managing the crypto data keys.

@_subject: [Cryptography] What do we mean by Secure? 
Quoting Bill Frantz :
For myself security is just another engineering domain, like software
or electrical engineering.  When you design a secured system you have
to have a set of assumptions/axioms (like this PRNG is good), rules of
operation (like where user revocation or policy adjudication is performed),
etc.  And as with any engineering discipline you can trade off with
other engineering solutions (like storing keys in a hardware TPM versus
using password to decrypt them or versus inserting it with a CAC card).

Quoting Kent Borg :
No engineering discipline is perfect, think of crashed airplanes,
sunk boats, or collapsed bridges.
Your rightly point out that Security engineering has differences
from other engineering disciplines.
It usually has to prove a negative, which is a key difference.  Other
disciplines like the insurance industry face a similar challenge.
And like them we can use probability analysis (or if we have enough
historical data we can use statistics) to help us build a more secure
As for boundaries, and the failure thereof, I remember working with
some extremely good ex-NSA cryptographers.  They did an analysis that
they called partial-key analysis.  Basically they said let's say
somehow someone managed to recover some of the subkeys for a few
rounds of a cipher, how strong is that cipher now?  In the context
of a security system the equivalent is to relax some boundary conditions
or to let an axiom fail (for example an input to a PRNG is predictable).
Now how good is your security system design?
Once you grasp the essentials of how to design a secure system it
really is just another engineering discipline, albeit a bit weird
compared to mechanical, civil, electrical or software engineering.

I was re-reading my reply and realized I had missed a key point you
made about having clever humans trying to break into your system. This
malicious human aspect is actually a really key difference between
Security engineering and other engineering disciplines.
To me the answer is to provide your humans (security officers or police)
the tools to deal with those foes.  Thus you need to give them tools
for real-time detection and after-the-fact forensics.  Banks catch a
lot of (insider) thieves by reconciling books from different locations.

@_subject: [Cryptography] open questions in secure protocol design? 
Quoting ianG :
My experience with the IETF is that the sender (in a network protocol) should
encode in a single manner and that the receiver should be accepting of a wide
variety of encoding styles (that mean the same thing). My take is that
this is because the Internet is composed of heterogeneous software & hardware
and that protocol implementers would read the same specification and implement
it in slightly different ways.
On one project that I designed I applied this to our crypto  communications that
passed around data keys for enciphered data.  I recommended to each  our application
implementation teams to encrypt using one key type (say AES CTR for  team A and 3DES
CBC for team B), but to be accepting of a wide variety of key  types/modes while
decrypting (say AES, 3DES and Blowfish).  As long as the key lengths (and the
algorithms/modes) met the minimum policy requirement being applied to  the enciphered
data this worked fine.

And OpenStack is written using Python and AWS is probably using Java.
Lately I've been deep diving into the intricacies of ROP exploits of  OSes that can sidestep ASLR, no-execute stacks and heap pages, stack canaries,
etc.  My current work is to improve our security posture with ASA/Palo Alto/
Juniper firewalls, which is daunting given this latest news.
Sadly the newest ARM based OSes will be like Intel circa 2007, basically wide
open for exploitation. So there go smart phones, IoT appliances, cars, etc.
How the hell can we even protect even simple things like crypto keys or PRNGs
in the face of this onslaught?
All very depressing from a defense point of view.

Quoting Peter Gutmann :
This is so true.  After having spent several years with (legal) cyber-hacking
teams, I almost don't care about crypto anymore.
I'm far more worried about securing application code and OS kernel code as
much as possible without any real support in hardware or a real reference
monitor (for the latter case except possibly the more recent iOS/iPhone).
To me the question is how to better secure the app tool chain processes
effectively to reduce attack surfaces (like ASLR compiler flags, stack
canaries, usage of more secure Clib calls, etc.), to (methodically)
re-engineer kernels (and maybe silicon) to also reduce their attack surfaces.
And to have good monitoring and analysis tools (Netflix's FIDO comes to mind)
without overwhelming that person with false positives or huge amounts of
data (like using topographical data analysis, e.g. the Python Mapper open

Yes, things like a reference monitor or trusted path would be great to have,

BTW, speaking of reference monitor, I attended at Black Hat a talk about
Apple's secure enclave processor, introduced with the iPhone S5.  It was
pretty cool but it was still limited by the lack of higher level context
for its policy adjudication logic.
