@_subject: text/reference on computer security? 
I second Vin's mention of Howard & LeBlanc's _Writing Secure Code_. IMHO it
is much more approachable than Anderson's book, which is probably better for
designers and architects. MS bought several thousand copies of the first
edition and made it mandatory reading for developers; the second edition
(just out) is greatly expanded.

Can any of you recommend a good text or reference on computer security? I'm
looking for something targeted at the system/application developer more than
the network administrator, the kind of book you wish more people at Microsoft
had read.

@_subject: why are CAs charging so much for certs anyway? (Re: End of  the line for Ireland's dotcom star) 
Comodo is a sub-CA of GTE, so it's pretty decent. On my machines here, I did
have to install their subordinate CA cert, but it was a simple matter to add
it to the AD CTL.
