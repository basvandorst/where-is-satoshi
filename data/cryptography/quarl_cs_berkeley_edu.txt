As an authentication protocol, it looks vulnerable to a time
synchronization attack: an attacker that can desynchronize the server
and client's clocks predictably can block the client's authentication
and use it as his own.  (Assuming the server's clock is monotonically
increasing, the command can only be used once.)  If the command utilizes
the IP address (e.g. as a port knock), this is a security hole.
