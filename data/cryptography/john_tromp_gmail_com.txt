@_subject: [Cryptography] Cuckoo Cycles: a new memory-hard proof-of-work system 
I'd like to announce a new proof-of-work system based on
Cuckoo hashing.
A preliminary version of the whitepaper is available online at

As author of Cuckoo Cycle, let me address your concerns.
The Cuckoo Cycle project page at  in fact lists a
"Linear Time-Memory Trade-Off Bounty
$500 for an open source implementation that uses at most N/k bits
while running up to 15 k times slower, for any k>=2.
Both of these bounties require N ranging over {2^28,2^30,2^32} and
 ranging over {1,2,4,8}, and further assume a high-end Intel
Core i7 or Xeon and recent gcc compiler with regular flags as in my
The whitepaper at
devotes a Section to Time-Memory Trade-Offs (TMTOs) that further
details the memory hardness claims.
Which you seem to conveniently ignore in your own notion of memory-hardness :-(
Instead, what you're talking about is covered in the later Section
which show the gains achievable by using multiple threads.
The algorithm you outline is also detailed in the earlier Section
"Cuckoo Cyle basic algorithm"
and is in fact what motivates the its name.
It's almost as if you've gone out of your way to avoid reading the whitepaper:-)
You don't need parallel sort for that; the parallel version of the
basic algorithm
already does it. But note that:
1) it uses 32 times more memory than the Cuckoo Cycle reference algorithm
2) the parallel memory accesses are going to form a latency bottleneck when
    the number of threads runs into the hundreds.

I would prefer to call that parallelization hardness.
Memory hardness should ideally be about the suffering caused by having less
than the designated amount of memory available.
This is already implemented and results are shown in the section
called "Parallelization". I don't understand why you need sorting though.
Unfortunately, I have no access to a working Xeon Phi
multicore cpu that would allow me to try more than 40 threads.
I do expect the parallel speedup to flatten out at around a hundred threads.
For AMD Opteron based servers, it already flattened at 30.

Ok; but leaving out that crucial word "sequential" in your original
post threw me off...
Is there a mistake other than my notion of memory-hardness differing from
Percival's SMH?
Ok. Your Momentum hypercube architecture may use 2 orders of magnitude
more memory compared with a Cuckoo-inspired one using 2^25 bits,
but worse, you cannot discard the cost of the communication
network. And you cannot have constant length connections.
Even a 3D implementation requires connections of length n^{1/3}.
When you a're ready to shift focus back to Cuckoo Cycle, I would like to see a
detailed description of your implementation avoiding latencies for
1000s of threads. I expect it will be very expensive compared to a
commodity solution that I hope will be economically near-optimal.
Cuckoo Cycle uses the much cheaper-to-compute siphash24 hash function,
which contributes only 1/3 of the total running time (the other 2/3
being memory latency). With native hardware support in the form of a
hypothetical cpu-instruction for a single siphash round (far cheaper
to implement than sha256) this 1/3 would reduce to mere percents.

Dave Andersen's latest remarks on his GPU code:
You can ask him what he thinks is a faster implementation.
Fore reduced memory, you can find all collisions in 8MB,
using Cuckoo Cycle's algorithm for finding 2 cycles in bipartite graphs.
To me, that's a completely different beast.
I would no longer call that Momentum...

There's no addresses to monitor.

It spreads out the bandwidth more, with 1 minute blocks.

This can be done more efficiently in log_2(w) steps for w-bit wide values.
