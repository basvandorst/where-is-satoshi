@_subject: [Cryptography] Where should I start with cryptography? 
please buy this book [1] (note: I'm not involved with authors, I used it
back in my days at University, and still using it). Then read it, from
beginning, at least one time. Do exercises, and pratice yourself against
theory. Then, buy this other book [2], and read it al least one time.
Then go back to the first, re-read it again, and read the second.
Have a nice day :-)

Anyway, I don't think hardware or software is making a difference. Bugs
exist in both..
For instance, please see this article [1] (excuse me for the language, you
can easily use google translate, and for the really long URL). It says
that an Iphone 5, with IOS8, was easily decrypted by an Israelian
company, appointed by the judge, in less than one working week, and that
having a crack for IOS9 is only a matter of time (week? month?).
Apart for freedom consideration (which probably belongs to cypherpunks
rather than here, could a judge order to crack something?), it is clear
that there's no need to insert backdoors: just wait the proper amount of

Might I disagree? That was true on PDP-11, not anymore. That opens up an
entire set of flaws which are introduced by hardware makers in the
tentative to speed up things, because we do not have anymore a fast low-level
language suitable for the modern hardware (well, except for ASM).
Worth reading: Have a nice day
