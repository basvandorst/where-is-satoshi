@_subject: compressing randomly-generated numbers 
I see where you're coming from, but take an imperfectly random source
and apply a deterministic function to it, and if I recall correctly, you
still have a imperfectly random output. It would be better to use
something like Von Neumann's unbiasing algorithm (or any of the newer
improvements) to strip out the non-randomness.
He probably meant optimal in the information theoretic sense. If that
was the case, then no, optimal compression will not yield a null-length
output -- it will give you the minimum length output that could
represent your input from among all inputs. Or maybe he didn't ;)

@_subject: length-extension and Merkle-Damgard hashes 
See Section 3.3 of Coron, Dodis, Malinaud and Puniya's "A New Design
Criteria for Hash-Functions". They address this and several other
problems with the M-D construction in this paper submitted to the 2005
NIST Hash Workshop. (
