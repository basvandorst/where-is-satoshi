@_subject: Examining the Encryption Threat 
In one of the issue of ijde found at
 the authors have
analysed various encryption applications and discussed results for few
sample applications. Does any one have the complete results. Tried
mailing the author but no response. Any one having further info.
Abstract from the paper
"This paper is the result of an intensive six-month investigation into
encryption technologies conducted at the Computer Forensic Research &
Development Center (CFRDC) at Utica College. A significant number of
encryption applications were collected and cataloged. A roadmap for the
identification of the unique characteristics of encrypted file formats
was created. A number of avenues were explored and the results
documented. The actual process is not outlined comprehensively due to
proprietary needs; however, the following briefly details the process and
the significance of our findings."
