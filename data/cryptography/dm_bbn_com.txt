   Tthere's a balancing act here: Do you risk your Trojan being
   discovered by McAfee and Symantec, or do you risk someone blabbing
   when you ask them to avoid blocking it, when the odds are they
   won't block it in the foreseeable future?
The AV companies had also better be subtle in how they overlook Magic
Lantern, or else picking through their machine code might tell you too
much about how to detect Magic Lantern.
