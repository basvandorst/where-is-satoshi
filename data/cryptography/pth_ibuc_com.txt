I believe the suggestion is that it has either a) become too dangerous, or b) it is
to make a statement.
As to a), do you feel you would enjoy sharing a cell with Dmitry Skylarov?  You might
be able to come up with some nifty new algorithms while enjoying the haute cuisine
of the U.S. penal system.
As to b), Suppose you feel that _your_ particular presentation is covered by the
DMCA research exemption, and you have been assured by the MPAA and RIAA
that they have absolutely _no_ interest in having you arrested.  Do you think the
sunshine and beaches of Santa Barbara will be sufficient compensation when Crypto
fails to attract those world-class researchers who either fear for their immediate
safety or fear for the future of cryptographic research in the good ole U S of A?
The alternative venues suggested are all outside of U.S. jurisdiction.

Skipping over the quadratic residuosity, as I read the powerpoints, the
"Authority(ies)" create the private keys for users in response to "Hello,
I'm Bob" identity proofs (unspecified).  Then the private key is transmitted
to alleged-Bob for use in private communication with Alice, et al.
How is this different from classic key escrow?
It would appear that even if the"Authority" forgot Bob's private key they
always have the information to regenerate it.  Even the discussion of "split
authorities" (slides 48 ff)  is eerily reminiscent of earlier proposed risk
mitigation strategies for key escrow agents.
