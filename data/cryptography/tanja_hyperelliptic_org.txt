@_subject: Who cares about side-channel attacks? 
At Crypto'08 a team from Bochum demonstrated their side-channel attack on KeeLoq. There were some theoretical attacks before but the SCA really
broke it. KeeLoq is being used by some car manufacturers and by most garage door

First of all congratulations to the team at EPFL!
James, do I really have to point out the obvious that just because 112 bits is a new record this does not mean that 113 is undoable today. The coolness of this result is that a smallish cluster of low cost machines could do this computation in only half a year. 200 PS3s cost you no more than 200 x 400 USD at published prices - and less if you buy that many at once. So with about 1 000 000 USD and a full year you would get 122 bits already now and agencies have a bit more budget than this! Furthermore,
the algorithm parallelizes extremely well and can handle a batch of 100
targets at only 10 times the cost. So, yes, we sure will be able to break 130 bits in 2033 - but certainly
much sooner if anyone tries.

NO. Read
Fabian Kuhn, Ren? Struik: Random Walks Revisited: Extensions of
Pollard's Rho Algorithm for Computing Multiple Discrete Logarithms.
Selected Areas in Cryptography 2001: 212-229
Section 4.
Besides, the estimates assume only playstations and the EPFL code instead of special purpose hardware which would give an extra speed up.
And, no, I'm not suggesting to use the entire US gross national product
for a year to break your key but given that that breaks 172 bits (SHARCS
2006 estimates for ECC-163 and 9 bits to scale from USD 5.8*10^11 to the
GDP 1.4*10^13) I'm not comfortable with 160 bits, let alone 144.
All the best

@_subject: Is this the first ever practically-deployed use of a threshold scheme? 
If the system is built to allow resharing then this is no problem. Resharing from a t-out-of-n scheme to an r-out-of-m scheme works as
follows: If the secret s is shared using the (otherwise random)
polynomial f of degree t then a share consists of (i,f(i)). To reshare, at least t or the original shareholders issue shares of f(i) in an r-out-of-m manner, i.e. take a polynomial gi of degree r and
compute m shares (i,j,gi(j)). When these are distributed to the new
users, the new users should end up with matching j's. The old shares
(i,f(i)) are deleted. Each of the m new users now has t shares (i1,j,gi1(j)), (i2,j,gi2(j)), ... ,(it,j,git(j)). This information can be combined into a single share (j,G(j)) of s by using the Lagrange coefficients of the first scheme.
All of this can be decorated with zero knowledge proofs to prove
correctness of the shares etc. Note that there is no interaction of the
t shareholders and everthing can be done remotely.
In the scenario that one share A is published it's enough to have t-1
users help in the resharing since every new user can use the public
information. On the other hand that's a mess to program, so it's more
resonable to ask t of the remaining shareholders to help. Doesn't sound
like a coordination nightmare to me.
For all this in a more general setting see e.g. "Redistributing Secret
Shares to New Access Structures and Its Applications" by Yvo Desmedt
and  Sushil Jajodia  (1997) Does this answer the question?

Note that the majority of the claims (and the entirety of the granted
claims in the US and JP so far; they got all parts granted in Europe) is on escrow avoidance; i.e. on using the procedure for alternative points from the SP800-90 appendix. I.e. if a vendor gets sufficiently worried about the potential backdoor but doesn't want to do a completely new implementation he will opt for other points ---> royalties.
I had hoped so.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Dual EC backdoor was patented by Certicom? 
At the risk of touting my own horn here: That part of the projectbullrun page is up since Thursday and has much more. In Dec we knew that there was a publication in 2007 and that there
were differences between the claims in that and the granted ones; there
was a priority date of 2005 on the 2007 publication.
By digging through the prosecution history I now have proof that
* Brown and Vanstone knew the full extend of the back door (how to use
  it, how to avoid it) when they filed their provisional application Jan
  2005.
* The application was handed to the NSA, hence from that point on they
  knew of the back door (and knew that others knew) -- just in case they
  had missed it before ...
* The reason that the escrow claim is missing in the granted patend is
  purely administrative -- Certicom had to split the patent, at this
  point they have one derivative application running and can file for
  more.
Other news:
* The full patent got granted in the EU, i.e. both escrow use and escrow
  avoidance.
* The European patent is being maintained, meaning they keep paying.
Finally, the first pubication of this whole application was in 2006!
just a few weeks after SP800-90 came out and before any company had
their implementation certifed.

Dear Thierry,
No. That one contains other mechanisms of escrow avoidance. Citing myself here
" Interestingly, the claims in the new application [13770533.pdf pages
51?55] do not actually cover Dual EC exploitation: they are for other
mechanisms of Dual EC escrow avoidance. However, Certicom is still free
to file further claims for Dual EC exploitation, retaining the original
21 January 2005 priority date. As of February 2014, the new application
is under examination. It was published on 4 July 2013 as publication US
 Their claims only cover _usage_ of the back door and avoidance of the
back door, they do not claim to have invented the back door.
Note that the publication date of the international application
(verbatim the same) was 2006/07/27.
