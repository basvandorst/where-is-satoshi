@_subject: secure hash modes for rijndael 
There are many hash constructions based on block ciphers with the same block
and key length; most are insecure. Matyas-Meyer-Oseas, Davies-Meyer, and
Miyaguchi-Preneel are three of the few so far unbroken constructions. See
either Schneier's "Applied Cryptography" or  Menezes' et al. "Handbook of
Applied Cryptography" for details.
As always, any new scheme should undergo intense cryptanalysis for reasonably
long before being actually deployed. You could, of course, submit your proposal
to a crypto conference (or at least to the IACR e-Print archive) for peer
Paulo Barreto.
