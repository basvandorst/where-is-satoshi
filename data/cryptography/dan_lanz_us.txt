I have been involved for the past several years in the development of a specification Common Interface to Cryptographic Modules (CICM) that defines an application programming interface specifically for high assurance cryptographic modules.  High assurance modules are typically developed by countries for their government, diplomatic and military communications.  The interface differs from commercial interface standards like PKCS primarily for its support for domain separation, but also for the richer module and key management capabilities required by high assurance modules.  To my knowledge, CICM is the first generic high assurance API that has been developed.  There has been considerable interest in the specification in the high assurance community.
The specification has recently been submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an Internet Draft and is available at  .  I would like to encourage interested individuals to participate in the standardization process through the IETF.  If you have an interest in this effort, feel free to sign up for the IETF CICM mailing list by visiting  .
