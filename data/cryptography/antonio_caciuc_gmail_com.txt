@_subject: SRP-Hermetic - a new cryptography library for web applications 
Ladies and Gentlemen of the Cryptography Mailing List,
I am pleased to announce the release of yet another open source(MIT
License) cryptography library for web applications.

edges, I am open to suggestions for improvement.
