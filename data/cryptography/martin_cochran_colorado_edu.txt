@_subject: 307 digit number factored 
The 307 digit number had a special form (2^{1039} - 1) - the authors  are careful to point out that their techniques would not be as  effective on an RSA modulus.  But then they go on to argue the  current practical feasibility of factoring a 1024-bit RSA modulus.

This might work, although 90% of the steps seem to unnecessarily (and  perilously) complicate the algorithm.  What's wrong with starting  with input SALT || PASSWORD and iterating N times, where N is chosen  (but variable) to make brute-force attacks take longer?  It seems  like the designers are trying to specify a cryptographic hash  algorithm...where they make black box calls to SHA-256 or SHA-512.   It's much simpler to just let SHA-256 and SHA-512 do the work.
Adding a requirement that the salt be 128 bits (or more) would  improve the security against brute-force attacks more than any of the  other (convoluted) parts of the algorithm.  I suppose one could argue  that 8 ASCII characters for the salt is relatively secure today, but  what about in 20 years?

If the salt space is large enough ( > 128 bits, say) and the salts  are generated with a good source of randomness, then it's  overwhelmingly likely that an attacker will have to do a dictionary  attack per user anyway, even across many different machines.  Also,  with such a large salt space it's extremely unlikely that users who  choose the same passwords will have the same salt.

@_subject: Double Encryption Q 
If your original mode of operation is secure, then this should be  The reduction:
Consider algorithm A that tries to break the double encryption mode of  operation (DM) in the IND-CPA setting.  We can construct an algorithm  B that tries to break the original mode of operation (OM) in the IND- CPA setting.  B simply runs A and responds to A's queries by querying  B's oracle twice to simulate A's oracle, and returning the result.  B  returns the output of A.
If A breaks the encryption, so does B.  So if the original mode is IND- CPA secure, this double encryption should be okay.
Note that the examples given, OCB and CTR with repeated counters, are  not IND-CPA secure.

Comments inline.
Depending on the lifetime of the keys involved, you can probably  truncate the MAC tags much more than this.  Using the RTP counter for  use in some appropriate stateful MAC may mean a 3- or 4-byte tag is  enough security.  Additionally, in order to conserve bandwidth you  might want to make a trade-off where some packets may be forged with  small probability (in the VOIP case, that means an attacker gets to  select a fraction of a second of sound, which is probably harmless),  but it is hard to forge many packets.
In ( John Black and I treat this  model in depth, and suggest a MAC scheme which may be most appropriate  for this scenario.  A stateful, highly-truncated HMAC will also work  fine, but is slower than the scheme we propose.

@_subject: Upper limit? 
Using the prime number theorem you can get an estimate on the number  of such pairs.  Prime number theorem says that there are asyptotically  2^{512}/ln(2^{512}) primes less than 512 bits.  So there are roughly  2^{512}/ln(2^{512}) - 2^{511}/ln(2^{511}) ~ 2^{511}/ln(2^{512} 512-bit  primes.  Squaring this and dividing by two will give the approximate  number of pairs - 2^{1021}/(ln(2^{512}))^2.
Generalizing this for a n-bit RSA modulus gives 2^{n-3}/(ln(2^{n/ 2}))^2 expected pairs.
Of course, well-chosen RSA primes usually have some special properties  so that (p-1) and (q-1) don't have too many small factors and so that  (p-q) isn't smaller than 2^{n/4}, so the above figures might be off by  a bit if you consider the resulting distribution.  But they should  still be fairly close (maybe within a factor of ln(2^{n/2})?).
