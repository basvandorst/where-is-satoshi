*That* is the Right Way To Do It. If there are variable parts (like
hash OID, perhaps), parse them out, then regenerate the signature data
and compare it byte-for-byte with the decrypted signature. Anything
you don't understand/control that might be variable (e.g. options) is
eliminated by this process.
I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with ASN.1 DER in
crypto applications.

@_subject: PunchScan voting protocol 
I've done quite a bit of work with this protocol. The protocol assumes
the existence of an Election Authority. The Authority has the master
keys required to generate certain data sets, and these keys give the
Authority the ability to associate ballot numbers with votes. Note
that this doesn't necessarily give the Authority the ability to
associate people with votes.
There are no per-ballot keys, so there is no partial exposure risk.
It's all-or-nothing.
What is "the" whole problem? Please provide an attack model.

 I think there are some misconceptions/assumptions in play here about the
privacy available in current systems. Punchscan was designed to provide an
unconditional levels of integrity into the voting process, not to improve
privacy over the status quo. Election officials, ultimately, are still
responsible for protecting the privacy of voters. The cryptography is meant
as a tool to be used by election officials that prevents anyone from
arbitrarily changing vote totals without getting caught. I do not think that
Punchscan is noticeably worse than current systems in terms of privacy
protection and it is still unclear to me if there is any real difference at

printed.  Suppose somebody attaches a tiny "spy camera" to

 In a traditional system, you can put the spy cameras in the polling place
so you can watch each voter vote. That will allow you to *directly* target
and identify each voter in a location where election authorities exert *less

It's a real (old) vulnerability in DH, but I don't think it applies

can just send a copy to the observer.
It makes mitm easier on unauthenticated links, but that's not a new
exposure of any kind.
