?Interdiction? is the fact of rerouting packages in transit from factory to customer, so as to be able to hack on it. ANT is a division of TAO, customers are other NSA people.
DNT and CES are probably other NSA divisions, customers of ANT?s products

yet, one can find this sort of thing in 3rd position when searching "nginx crypto" :
quote :
The developers of Nginx have recently changed the default SSL ciphers to include the very strong Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) cipher. DHE is used to provide perfect forward secrecy in TLS.
Further reading on Ephermal Diffie-Hellman, PFS and TLS at Wikipedia.org
While I applaud this move on the part of the Nginx dev team there is a tradeoff and that is slower performance. DHE provides stronger encryption which in turn requires more computation but here?s where it gets interesting. To meet today?s PCI DSS crypto standards DHE is not required. Like many things in life there?s a balance to be struck between the risk of compromised encryption and the additional expense or rather the relative loss of connections per second. I?m not a lawyer nor should this be considered legal advice but I prefer things that go fast while meeting the necessary PCI compliance criteria.
In order to disable DHE in the server context of the Nginx configuration add the following line:
ssl_ciphers RC4:HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!kEDH;

according to  , most protocols only talk about padding at the end of the cleartext before encryption.
now, how about adding some random at the beginning of the cleartext, say, 2.5 times
the block size, that is 40 bytes for the example above, of random stuff before the interesting text appears ?

@_subject: [Cryptography] Does RISC V solve Spectre ? 
RiscV is an ISA, for which there are a number of implementations possible..
Spectre and Meltdown are consequences of implementation fallacies /
bugs, most notably, allowing a process to access cached data whether or
not it is authorized to do so in certain circumstances.
those bugs have nothing to do with core frequency.
thus, RiscV may or may not be susceptible, depending on implementation

I tested it and it works great, I do have one beef with it however, that
is, it is UDP only (for the sake of simplicity, I get it), which makes
it not work with broken ISPs that do shitty NAT, and only pass TCP (heck
sometimes only http(s) works correctly) properly (and even then, the
underlying connection is not stable so it needs automatic restart and
anyone has a solution to this kind of usecase ?
