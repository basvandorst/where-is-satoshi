@_subject: Israeli compromise of U.S. telecommunications? 
I found the following four-part report by Carl Cameron rather shocking:
Part 1: Part 2: Part 3: Part 4: Why should we be freely giving to Israeli corporations
information (call records, CALEA information) that requires
court orders to obtain in this country?  Such information
is obviously sensitive, and the well-motivated efforts to
strengthen and protect our national infrastructure should
reasonably include mandating that such information not be
routinely handled by any foreign entities...
A more recent story indicates that the compromise was
probably severe; criminals were escaping detection
because of the compromise:
   This vindicates concerns many of us have expressed
over the years about creating single points of failure
in wiretapping systems (e.g. the vulnerability of key
escrow, etc.).  Of course, in this case the vulnerability
was intentionally created, it seems, by giving critical
capabilities to foreign entities...

@_subject: SSSCA = Digital Rectal Thermometer Security Act ? 
Hi all --
I just sat down and read the proposed text of the Holling's SSSCA bill.
         Boy is this bill breathtaking in its breadth! I have tried to understand
its language.  It says in Section 101:
     "It is unlawful to manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide
or otherwise traffic in any interactive digital device that does not
include and utilize certified security technologies that adhere to
the security systems standards adopted under section 104."
and says in Section 109:
         "The term "interactive digital device" means any machine, device,
product, software, or technology, whether or not included with or as
part of some other machine, device, product, software, or technology,
that is designed, marketed or used for the primary purpose of, and
that is capable of, storing, retrieving, processing, performing,
transmitting, receiving, or copying information in digital form."
Putting 2+2 together, we see that essentially all digital devices and
software will have to have "certified security technologies" in them.
Anything that works primarily with digital data is covered.
My feeble brain came up with the following list of things that would
have to be secured.  I'm sure you can think of lots more.
         -- All bar-code scanners
         -- All computer-controlled ignition systems
         -- All metro ticket readers
         -- All digital watches and calculators
         -- All ATM machines
         -- All digital cellular phones
         -- All digital answering machines
         -- All GPS receivers
         -- All sports scoreboards and the marquee signs in Times Square
         -- All electronic parking meters
         -- Almost all lab equipment (everything is digital these days)
         -- All software, for sure
         -- All digital cameras and digital movie cameras
         -- All PC's and game consoles
         -- All remote key-entry systems and most home security systems
         -- All stop-light controllers
Well, I should leave some of the fun to you. But of course
my favorite should be listed:
         -- All digital rectal thermometers
Presumably some staffers will try to rescue this
laughable (albeit a bit scary) lobbyist-written proposal.
Of course, just letting the bill die is probably best.  But if
they want to fix things, they should consider adding language
that makes it ILLEGAL to sell copy-protection technology
that doesn't permit at least
         -- fair use, including time-shifting and making a reasonable
           number of copies for personal or educational use, or
           for backups,
         -- free use of a copyrighted item once the copyright has
           expired
(This list should be expanded.)
But in any case, making any security technology *mandatory* on all
digital devices and computers is clearly a non-starter.  Why, we'd probably
have to close down all the country's computer science departments
(can't have these kids making unsecured devices, you know, even if
it is their homework assignment to build a computer...)

@_subject: Wiretap Act Does Not Cover Message 'in Storage' For Short  
Yes, I was amazed at this ruling as well.
This ruling seems to fly in the face of the likely intent of
Congress when it passed Wiretap Act.
If things continue in this direction, we will soon have
rulings and regulations that say:
     -- Carriers must put all calls in storage for a minimum
        period of time, sufficient to allow wiretapping.
        (Indeed, regulation may not be necessary, as digitization and
         buffering of communications is common practice; the
         transient use of storage to effect communications
         efficiency and reliability should not provide a wiretap
         loophole.)
     -- Wiretapping is OK for any phone calls that are routed
        through a satellite.
     -- It is OK for the government to house soldiers in your
        house, as long as there is even the tiniest opening somewhere in
        your house (e.g. a window open, or a chimney flue)
        so that "inside" and "outside" connect.
     -- Etc.
I can also see a market developing for "storage-free" communications
carriers.  What happens when you inquire of your carrier as to
whether it can provide such a guarantee or option?
         Cheers,

@_subject: The Pure Crypto Project's Hash Function 
Adi Shamir once proposed the following hash function:
     Let n = p*q be the product of two large primes, such that
     factoring n is believed to be infeasible.
     Let g be an element of maximum order in Z_n^* (i.e. an
     element of order lambda(n) = lcm(p-1,q-1)).
     Assume that n and g are fixed and public; p and q are secret.
     Let x be an input to be hashed, interpreted as a
     non-negative integer.  (Of arbitrary length; this may be
     considerably larger than n.)
     Define hash(x) = g^x (mod n).
Then this hash function is provably collision-resistant, since
the ability to find a collision means that you have an x and
an x' such that
     hash(x) = hash(x')
which implies that
     x - x' = k * lambda(n)
for some k.  That is a collision implies that you can find a
multiple of lambda(n).  Being able to find a multiple of lambda(n)
means that you can factor n.
I would suggest this meets the specs of your query above.

@_subject: Modulo based hash functions [was: The Pure Crypto 
Hi Ralf --
Proposal (A) does not have the multiplicative defect
you claim.  (In particular, it is not RSA encryption, since
the input x is in the exponent not in the base.)
Also, the intent of the proposal (A) is that the entire
messages (even if gigabtyes long) be treated as one long
integer x.  The security proof still works fine here,
so there is no size limit on what can be hashed this way.
But, depending on your application, it is likely to be
too slow for large inputs (aka unusable...)
