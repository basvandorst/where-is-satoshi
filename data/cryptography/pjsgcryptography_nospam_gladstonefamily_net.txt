Indeed. Why would anyone believe that the output is unpredictable? For all we know, they could have generated all the "random" values for the next 20 years and already sold them to someone.
The only way of preventing this is to mix in something that really cannot be known before the critical instant (DJIA, most recent spin on 20 roulette wheels at Caesar's Palace, etc).

This is the archive from a german casino:   -- not entirely clear how often this is updated and whether it plays every day etc.

Where does the random number come from that indicates which of the rolls is not observed? I suspect that you are just moving the problem around....

My impression was that the steckerboard did not significantly help against cryptanalysis (contrary to what the Germans thought). The closures (or cycles) that were used to drive the bombes were independent of the steckering.

@_subject: [Cryptography] How to crypto secure speed limit signs 
You also need to worry about the difference between the actual speed limit on the road, and the speed limit according to some path through a set of speed limit signs. There was a big expose a few years ago in the US where it turned out that towns were putting up artificially low speed limit signs in order to get speeding fine revenue. The problem was that they were putting these signs on state roads illegally. For example: A related question is "what defines the speed limit at any point on a road?" Once you can answer this, then "Is there an algorithm which a driver (or car) can follow to determine this speed?"

@_subject: [Cryptography] Dells are shipping with a rogue root level CA 
There are a number of machines directly accessible that serve up a certificate signed by this root CA cert. They seem to all be serving the same cert which has CN=localhost and the same public key. This cert was signed back on 7 April 2015.
This doesn't answer what the CA is *for*, but it does indicate that it is in *use*.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Checking for the inadvertent use of test keys 
I suspect that you could check the SHA256 hash of the keys in perfect safety. This suggests that you could build a service that just remembered (the hashes of) all the keys and told the requester to use (or not to use) a particular key.
Of course, such a scheme would make it difficult to set up an encrypted channel from point A to point B as the second person would be told that their key was no good.
Back to the drawing board....

In other words, you have to understand the threat model that you are defending against.
