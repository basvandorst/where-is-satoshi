Hi Peter,
  I had this working using openCryptoki, the trousers TSS and Mozilla
Thunderbird on openSUSE Linux.  If the setup instructions aren't in
the various readmes of those projects I can help you set it up if
you'd like.
  A simple PKCS app to extract the public key is all that's needed
with the above tools.
  Done. :-)  Last time I tested this it worked fine...  Circa 2006...
