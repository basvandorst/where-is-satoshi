Hi Adam,
I believe they have, at least to a large degree. InstantSSL ( sell 128-bit certificates for $49USD/annum. Certainly far cheaper than the VeriSign or Thawte equivalent. This is their 'base' level service which comes with a $50USD warranty, email based support and a 30 day refund/reissue policy. One of our clients uses one of their certificates and we haven't had an issue with it.
