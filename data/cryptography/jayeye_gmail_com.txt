OK, I'll bite.
This is not just a matter of physics. You have a lot of other
components in the system, each introducing noise of various forms
(mostly thermal, but lots of other kinds of noise is introduced by
real electronics).
What's the point anyway? In a real system, there are lots of points
*after* the actual generation of a random event where the bitstream
may be compromised (and certification doesn't mean anything, as the
certifiers are also your usual adversaries, and they are just a way
for lawyers to point fingers at each other anyway, or, like most
certifications, they are marketing hype to get upper-level management
to sign off on expensive purchases.

I love the assertion that it works just as well as the old TVL vans

What do people use these to specify authorization/access-control policies?
AWS uses their own declarative (and adequate for the job) policy
language, but it only works for their own resources; ditto for the
Google compute engine. I've seen things like the zope security policy
stuff, but it looks a mess, and it will probably take me less time to
roll my own than fit it to my use case.

course, is what I really want, but nobody seems to have touched it in
over ten years, and I don't have the resources to have a modern

My first-generation iPad has not received an update in years. Nor have
my old Android devices. Presumably people who don't get the latest
gadget every six months are not worthy of upgrades, but they do
contribute to the swarms of attack bots. Even MSFT still pushes
updates for XP, even though they declared it EOL years ago.

============================== START ==============================

How hardened against physical attacks is it?
If the pin is what unlocks the drive, either the key is stored in the
clear somewhere on flash, or it's encrypted with the pin, effectively
reducing it to 50 bits. Any adversary worth worrying about will crack
the drive open, etch the potting compound, if any, with nitric acid,
and access the flash directly.
As far as I'm concerned, there are only two things these encrypted
drives are good for: plausible deniability so your clients will have a
harder time suing you when you lose their data, and storing long keys
or other access credentials and hope that they delay the adversary
long enough for you to invalidate *those*. Of course, a sufficiently
powerful adversary will simply use rubberhose cryptanalysis and be
done with it.

We know we are in deep yogurt when even spy agencies recommend that we keep
more international students here:
The U.S. still educates a large portion of the world’s best students in
computer and computational science, many of whom are foreign national
citizens. We recommend consideration of programs that incentivize these
students to stay in the U.S. after graduation so that they contribute to
the development of U.S. HPC capabilities rather than returning to their own
countries; these programs would take the form of Visa or Green Card
programs that target Ph.D. graduates in HPC.
(and it's not just about HPC, but I don't want to derail the conversation
too much).

@_subject: [Cryptography] How Google's Physical Keys Will Protect Your 
Yubikey was actually developed in collaboration with Google. Unlike much of
Google's UX, it just works without being a pain (the two may not be
unrelated). The same key supports multiple independent providers, so I
don't have to keep swapping keys to authenticate to different sites. I just
love it, I wish my bank would also support it.
Pretty much the only service that I use that does not support it is AWS,
for reasons I cannot fathom; maybe the Dread Pirate Bezos hates their CEO.
As for names: Apple didn't invent the mouse, the windowing UI, or the
smartphone, but they are the ones who made that technology widely available
(mostly through excellent marketing, but that's not the point).

@_subject: [Cryptography] Linear B 
Wrong on almost all counts. Linear B was the writing system of what we call
the Mycenean civilization, so Mycenae and all the various cities in the
Peloponnese. Chadwick and Ventris's insight was to assume that LB was
(mostly) a syllabary and that the language was actually Greek. Since what
we call "Ancient Greek" these days is the register of the language of the
5th and 4th century writings, it makes no sense to say that 12th Century BC
Greek was based on ancient Greek. It is simply an even more ancient form of
None of this has anything to do with Crete; the Cretan language remains
unknown, its writing (Linear A) still undeciphered. There is no reason to
believe that it was actually Greek.
Linear B seems to be derived from Linear A, and is not very well suited to
writing Greek either. Unfortunately, all we have is accounting records;
nobody thought of committing to clay tablets any poetry or literature.
