@_subject: Cisco VPN password recovery program 
* * Via cryptome:
* * * *    The Cisco VPN Client uses weak encryption to store user and group
*    passwords in your local profile file.  I coded a little tool to
*    reveal the saved passwords from a given profile file.
* * If this is true, it doesn't sound like Cisco used a particularly smart
* design for this.
* Only for information, here is Cisco reply as passed on full-disclosure at lists.grok.org.uk and bugtraq at securityfocus.com
Hello -
The Cisco PSIRT is aware of reports that claim the Cisco VPN Client
password encryption uses a breakable algorithm to encrypt user
We are aware of reports at the following sites:
         This issue is related to a Security Notice that the Cisco PSIRT
released in October of 2004.  Cisco's public announcement can be found
The Cisco VPN 3000 Series has a configuration option that does not
allow the storage of the user password in the VPN client. For
customers that are concerned about the recovery of the user password,
the following option can be disabled to prevent local storage of the
user password.
- - ---------------------
Cisco Client Parameters
Allow Password Storage on Client - Check this box to allow IPSec
clients to store their login passwords on their local client
systems. If you do not allow password storage (the default), IPSec
users must enter their password each time they seek access to the
VPN. For maximum security, we recommend that you not allow password
- - ---------------------
Note that the default configuration of the VPN 3000 Series does not
allow client password storage. Additionally, this attack only affects
passwords that are static and reused for login to the VPN
network. Customers using one-time passwords (OTP) and certificates to
connect are unaffected.
We do greatly appreciate the opportunity to work with researchers on
security vulnerabilities, and welcome the opportunity to review and
assist in product reports.

@_subject: Quantum RNG (was: Use of TPM chip for RNG) 
About RNG, does someone in the list have any comment, ideas on this
"Quantis is a physical random number generator exploiting an elementary quantum optics process. Photons - light particles - are sent one by one onto a semi-transparent mirror and detected. The exclusive events (reflection - transmission) are associated to "0" - "1" bit values."
Just curious of your opinion.

@_subject: free e-voting software available?! 
I am working on the implementation of a system which should fit your requirements based on some work of mine and on
  "A Protocol for Anonymous and Accurate E-Polling",
  Danilo Bruschi, Igor Nai Fovino, Andrea Lanzi,
  E-Government: Towards Electronic Democracy, International Conference,   TCGOV 2005, Bolzano, Italy, March 2-4, 2005, Proceedings. Lecture   Notes in Computer Science 3416 Springer 2005, ISBN 3-540-25016-6
I am planning to release the first version together with docs etc, in september (the system is already working, but I prefer not to release preliminary test versions). PS. In case for the moment contact me in private for more infos.

@_subject: Intuitive cryptography that's also practical and secure. 
* * It occurs to me that the lack of secure, practical crypto primitives and
* protocols that are intuitively clear to ordinary people may be why
* cryptography has had so little impact on an even more important problem
* than psychic debunking, namely electronic voting. I think "intuitive
* cryptography" is a very important open problem for our field.
I can bring you my personal experience on this. I have been working for the last 2 years on a project about web-voting ( the system is now up and running and one election has been already done with it. I tried the best I could to make it simple and understandable, but people reactions have been worse than what I expected. Even if I tried to explain how the system works, how is the protocol, where cryptography enters etc.etc., I received comments - please remove all these comments about digital certificates etc., just write in the first page "protected by 128bit SSL" as everybody else does
- there are too many pages, can't you give in the first page the form to vote and ask the credentials for voting, and a second page of acknowledgment that the vote has been received?
- this receipt stuff and checking the votes are dangerous, please give only the totals at the end and no receipts
and so on (I spare you the 'graphical design is lousy', which it is, and After having talked with some people, my feeling is that the averge guy feels more confident to vote in a web-site "protected by 128bit SSL", a lot of logos, javascripts, moving objects etc. (the more stuff there is on the web site, the more impressive are the guys who made it) and a big database (better if Oracle) to store your votes. Unfortunately the voting experience on my system is exactly the opposite :-(
PS. any comment on my protocol/system is greatly appreciated.
