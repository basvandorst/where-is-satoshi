No. When you use CBC mode, the IV needs to be unpredictable, not just non-repeating. This is a real requirement, if you do not use an unpredictable IV, you can get attacks like for TLS.
Other modes (e.g. GCM) have weaker requirements (non-repeating) on IV than CBC mode.
What some people worry about is what happens when you reuse nonces, in which case CBC mode fails somewhat badly, but other modes (e.g. GCM) fail catastrophically.
This is all well-documented.
The encryption of the IV buys you non-predictability, which is exactly what you want. If TLS had done this, one attack would have been avoided.
Modern ciphers (at least DES and newer, probably also older designs) are meant to resist chosen plaintext attacks, and by extension, known plaintext attacks. This is *obviously* not a worry.
This fails trivially since it turns encryption into a deterministic process, which means that encrypting the same message twice results in the same ciphertext twice. For signatures, this is not a problem, since it is ok if a signature scheme is deterministic.
IV = HASH(K, data) is similar to how SIV works, by the way. You can easily turn SIV into a secure system by including a nonce among the associated data, as is explained by the SIV authors.
What practical people appear to worry about is that you need to process the entire message before you can begin producing ciphertext. This seems to be a requirement for misuse-resistant modes, and it is probably possible to prove a theorem to that effect. With AEAD modes such as GCM, you can begin producing ciphertext the moment you get the first bytes of the message, which is convenient in some settings, I am told.

Note that misuse-resistant means that in the event of IV reuse, all you reveal is whether two plaintexts are equal.
Your proposals reveal whether two plaintexts have an identical prefix, which is too much. So in the context of my claim, they are irrelevant.
Quoting from p. 4 of the AEZ paper: "Since McOE and COPA [2,23], some recent AE schemes have been advertised as nonce-reuse misuse-resistant despite being online.8 But online schemes are never misuse-resistant in the sense originally defined [51].9"
Furthermore, if you use a tweakable block cipher in a too naive mode, you are left with something that inherits a lot of weaknesses from ECB mode in the event of IV reuse.
Paraphrasing from the AEZ paper: misuse-resistance makes it easier to use a scheme, it does not make it easier to design or understand a scheme.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Perfect Integrity? 
4. aug. 2018 kl. 21:44 skrev Peter Fairbrother :
For ciphers, «information theoretic security» has a specific meaning that roughly translates into «an adversary with unlimited computing power does not learn anything from the ciphertext».
This definition does not make sense for integrity, so information theoretic has to get a new meaning with respect to integrity.
First, the context. We have a function f that takes a key and a message and outputs a tag. There are n distinct tags. Alice sends (m,t) to Bob, where t = f(k,m) and k is a shared key. Bob receives (m’, t’) and checks if f(k,m’) == t’.
Note (as has been said, already) that - regardless of what f is - Eve has a 1/n chance of creating a valid tag by choosing t’ at random. (At this point, some people say that information theoretic security is impossible and stop. Even though we haven’t defined what information theoretic security means yet…)
There are now two possible ways to define security: (a) no adversary should have greater than 1/n chance of creating a forgery, and (b) no adversary should have greater than eps chance of creating a forgery, for some small eps.
(b) is the most convenient content of «information theoretic integrity», and we may reserve the prefix «perfect» to denote (a).
First, an example that does not work (as has been noted): f(k,m) = k+m. Eve sets m’ = m + Delta and t’ = t + Delta and wins.
Next, an example that works: k = (a,b), f(k,m) = a*m + b. First, since b is random, Eve learns nothing about a from t. Next, suppose Eve sets m’ = m + Delta and t’ = t + Delta’. If Eve wins, then Delta’ = a*Delta. Since Delta is non-zero, the odds of that is exactly 1/n.
This extends in a fairly straight forward manner to longer messages via polynomial evaluation.
This theory was first developed by Carter and Wegman. It has since become very important, also for non-information theoretic cryptography.

This is a standard construction (see Wikipedia). It can be proven secure, even under quite weak assumptions.

It’s a fairly standard Diffie-Hellman key encapsulation method (KEM) similar to ECIES, followed by a somewhat standard symmetric cryptosystem. The hybrid construction is secure under the usual assumptions.
The claim is that it tolerates RNG failures, but that is obviously not true, since the KEM component does not tolerate RNG failures (e.g. an RNG with very low entropy).
It is possible to design schemes that retain some security even when the RNG fails (take any secure deterministic public key cryptosystem and add a nonce at an appropriate place), but this isn’t such a scheme.

@_subject: [Cryptography] secure authentication ... as opposed to passwords 
7. mai 2018 kl. 21:39 skrev John Denker via cryptography :
While zero knowledge proofs are great, they are on often not what you are looking for.
Quite often, what you actually want is authenticated key exchange. If you want to use a password to authenticate the key exchange, you need password-based authenticated key exchange (PAKE). There is an extensive literature on the topic. There are standards and software that allows you to use PAKE with TLS.
For various reasons, we don’t use it.

Does it? Pollard’s lambda certainly does not. I believe it can be made parallel with the usual techniques. That is, you can find collisions with little communication and insignificant storage.
