CFP --- The 2nd IEEE International Workshop on Security in e-Science and
e-Research (ISSR 2010)
Taipei, Taiwan, September 6-9, 2010
Website: To be held in conjunction with the 2010 IEEE International Symposium on
Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications (IEEE ISPA-10 )
E-Science and e-Research can, through development of e-Infrastructures such
as Grids, be used to support a wide range of research disciplines and
inter-disciplinary research. In recent years, the influence of e-Science and
e-Research has grown considerably, and their scope of application now covers
many research domains, from science and engineering disciplines such as
physical, biological, and clinical sciences, to the arts and humanities and
social sciences. Supporting e-Science and e-Research often places numerous
demands on capabilities associated with e-Infrastructures. One key challenge
is with regard to security. Security technologies must support a variety of
user and provider requirements such as authentication, authorization, trust,
privacy, policy management, information assurance, all in a user and
provider friendly framework. Many e-Science and e-Research projects have
developed distinctive security analyses, requirements, and technical
solutions for a variety of applications.
This workshop intends to provide a forum for researchers, developers and
users working on security issues associated with e-Science and e-Research to
exchange ideas and share experiences. The workshop has emphasis on
establishing a state-of-the-art for security in e-Science and e-Research,
identifying challenges and discussing solutions for successfully enabling
security for e-Science and e-Research. The workshop program will be a blend
of invited talks, presentations of research papers, and discussions about
the current status, emerging areas, and trends on security-related issues in
e-Science and e-Research.
We solicit original papers reporting a wide spectrum of topics related to
security in e-Science and e-Research. Topics of interest include, but are
not limited to:
- Eliciting security requirements for e-Science and e-Research applications
- Analysis of security challenges, threats, risks and issues in e-Science
and e-Research
- Security architectures, frameworks, and infrastructures for e-Science and
- Models and techniques for authentication and identity management in
e-Science and e-Research
- Models and techniques for authorization and access control in e-Science
and e-Research
- Trust model and management for e-Science and e-Research
- Privacy mechanisms and management for e-Science and e-Research
- Policy models and policy management in e-Science and e-Research
- Information assurance for e-Science and e-Research applications
- Security issues and solutions for data providers and data users
- Model and frameworks for security-driven workflows
- Supporting end-to-end security solutions for e-Science and e-Research
- User-driven security models for e-Science and e-Research
- Software engineering best practices in the development of security
- Experiences, case studies on the practical application of security models
and solutions in e-Science and e-Research
The format of submitted papers should follow the guidelines for IEEE
conference proceedings format (8.5" x 11", Two-Column). Each accepted paper
is limited to 6 pages (or 8 pages with over length charge).
Papers in PDF format should be submitted at
 via EasyChair.
Submitting a paper to the workshop means that if the paper is accepted, at
least one author should attend the workshop to present the paper. For
no-show authors, their papers will be removed from the digital library after
the conference and their affiliations will receive a notification.
The proceedings of this workshop will be published by IEEE Computer Society
Press (Indexed by EI). Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit
extended versions to the Special Issue on "e-Science: Infrastructure,
Service and Applications" - International Journal of Computer Systems
Science & Engineering (CSSE) - SCI Indexed.
