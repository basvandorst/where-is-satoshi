@_subject: Intel RNG still available? 
My whitebox Pentium 4 system has the 810 RNG, and it works. I'm not
sure which series motherboard it is; it's the one that uses cheap
commodity SDRAM, not Rambus or DDR memory.
Linux also supports the Intel 810 hardware RNG. Debian provides a
"rngd" daemon that reads the hardware RNG and shovels the bits into

Interestingly enough, the public references long ago published the
shuttle comm frequencies. Summarizing from:
S-band PM forward link frequencies: 2,106.4 MHz (primary) or 2,041.9
MHz (secondary)
S-band PM reverse link frequencies: 2,287.5 MHz (primary) or 2,217.5
MHz (secondary)
S-band PM forward link frequencies, military missions: 1,831.8 MHz
(primary) or 1,775.5 MHz (secondary)
S-band PM reverse link frequencies: 2,287.5 MHz (primary) or 2,217.5
MHz (secondary) - same as civilian
S-band FM downlink: 2,250.0 MHz
Ku-band forward link: 13.755 GHz
Ku-band reverse link: 15.003 GHz
UHF AM frequencies: 296.8 MHz, 259.7 MHz, 243.0 MHz (emergencies only)
and 279.0 MHz (EVA only)
Now it's certainly possible that this is misinformation, except for
the UHF frequencies 296.8 and 259.7, which many hams (including
myself) have personally verified.

It's interesting that you would cite that particular failure, because
it was ultimately caused by the use of obsolete computer hardware.
The software writers were well aware that certain floating point
variables might cause an exception when converted to fixed point. They
even added range checks to many of these conversions. But they
couldn't range check *every* variable before conversion because they
didn't have enough CPU cycles; a design rule required that peak CPU
utilization remain below 70%. So they had to pick and choose which
conversions would be range checked. They deliberately left "horizontal
velocity" unchecked because it wasn't possible (on Ariane 4) for that
variable to increase quickly enough to cause a problem if the launcher
flew normally. And if it wasn't flying normally, who cared? But Ariane
5 was designed to gain horizontal velocity much faster than Ariane
Had they used a newer, faster CPU they would have been able to range
check *every* variable before conversion, or use a more modern
architecture that wouldn't cause a fatal exception on an out-of-range
conversion. But hardware conservatism prevailed, with disastrous
