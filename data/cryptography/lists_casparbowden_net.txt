Is it just me, or is the HeartBleedin' obvious fallacy here, that TLA adversaries use exploits in ways that won't necessarily (and in fact are unlikely to) show material losses?

this  has more background, but not the outcome
In brief, in 2000 the UK legislated the power to demand keys (or decryption) of arbitrary (past or *future*) data.
In the original bill, the UK govt wanted to reverse the ordinary burden of proof, so that if a defendant is charged with failing to disclose a key, the defendant would have to prove they DO NOT have the key/password (sic), on a balance of probabilities, to escape conviction (!!!).
The bill was amended during passage, so that if a defendant does not know the password (or have the key), they must "adduce sufficient evidence to raise the issue", and then the judge ought to direct that the prosecution must prove they are lying beyond reasonable doubt (i.e. the the case flips back to the usual standard for criminal conviction). [These legal gymnastics not my idea BTW, but my briefing on the bleedin' obvious problems arising, caused the UK govt. to invent this bodge]
Strangely, the decryption part of the law wasn't activated until 2007, and I have never seen a case reported where this defence has been used. Nobody knows (AFAIK) what will suffice to "raise the issue", although in debate the govt. said going into witness box and making an assertion don't have key would be enough
This is a cautionary tale describing one case of how this law is working

Relax guys, those of you straining to achieve 10^9 speed-up in homomorphic crypto, or other ingenious ways to use crypto in Cloud computing can slacken the pace.
Apparently one third of IT managers* (Q.25), are already using crypto in Cloud applications, and they have exclusive control of the key, so panic over.
*4,275 business and IT managers in multiple countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Australia, Japan, Brazil, and Russia)

Hmm. When I posted it there was a clickbox to download whole .pdf report (28 pages), but apologies I did not alert that registration required (but it was kind of obvious)
The Download box is not there any more (but maybe pdf still available behind registration). I wonder why that might be.
Here's the relevant text (red is my emphasis) and screenshot with graphs
    *Who controls the encryption keys*
    Figure 24 examines the issue of control over encryption keys in the
    cloud environment for both encryption of data
    at rest and encryption of data at the application level. Thirty-four
    percent of respondents believe their organization
    is in control of encryption keys for *both* data encrypted at the
    *application level* and at rest in the cloud
    environment. Another 28 percent and 29 percent believe control of
    encryption keys is a *shared activity between**
    **the organization and the cloud provider*. Only 19 percent and 17
    percent of respondents, respectively, view the
    cloud provider as having control over encryption keys for either
    encryption at the application level or for data at
    rest

    Figure 25 shows German organizations are the most likely to say
    their organizations have control of encryption
    keys *at the application level *and for data at rest in the cloud.
    Brazilian respondents are the least likely to say their
    organizations have control over encryption keys at the application
    level and for data at rest in the cloud.

Although it is true that once the data+keys leave your premises, law enforcement could in theory isolate the machine in question and extract keys from RAM, the big difference is really when the remote machine falls under a foreign jurisdiction.
In that case, a law like FISA allows the service provider to be coerced into giving "all facilities and assistance" - in secret - to access an unlimited number of non-US Persons' data (with a 702 order), with no 4th Amendment probable cause standard, for the general pursuit of the foreign policy interests of US (1801(2)b)  [slides 13-19]. So if the service provider has means to access to the plaintext, that counts. No need for copious quantities of Freon and mobile PSUs, just an "ordinary" warrant-serving process - for an unlimited number of accounts (or potentially global keyword searches).
Altogether there are about 40 such discriminations categorically by nationality in US FISA+PATRIOT (another 45 if "Freedom Act" passes) and about 2 in Canadian, 10 Australian, 1 NZ, and 0 UK. There's one in Germany (G10), which is an embarrassment because such discrimination by nationality ought to be illegal under ECHR (and is except that blemish). [Most people in Europe think it is odd (to say the least) to think foreigners have a lesser human right to privacy than citizens - it is part of equal human dignity - and it is part of ECHR jurisprudence since So that makes a big difference when the threats/risk/consequences are different for a foreign government looking at the data versus the government of the territory where the data originates. Not only can data sent to the US be surveilled for literally any purpose (don't believe me, see the slides) without due process, and with no rights at all compared to substantial if theoretical rights for US Persons, the data can also be extracted by remote control from another continent by an authorised-but-compelled Cloud operator also. And since this judgement last week (and probably before in secret and unchallenged long before Snowden) for full range of criminal offences, not just spying.

Fisher's story is slippery - here's what Spiegel said in Dec 2014
Fisher's story is headlined "NSA probably didn't tap Merkel's phone
after all", but this is diluted in the text to "found no evidence that
the tapping ever occurred
which is what Range has been saying since June 2014. Der Spiegel as
above said :
  * On Oct. 17, 2013, SPIEGEL Berlin bureau chief Nikolaus Blome and
    reporter J?rg Schindler met with Steffen Seibert, Merkel's official
    spokesman. They presented him with a letter detailing the
    information obtained about spying on Merkel's mobile phone. The two
    made clear to Seibert that the paper was a copy of the details from
    an NSA database entry SPIEGEL had viewed. Seibert also understood it
    to be such.
One might speculate that if the original was an electronic document, it
would be wise for source protection not to surrender the electonic data.
Which is also slippery - the link Fisher provides says no such thing
(that it was not true)
