There is little difference in "paper" trail between Let's Encrypt
and any DV certificate.

Microsoft has since around 2000 been giving the source code to
various large corporations and governments.  It was at least in
the news that they gave it to China and the FSB (ex-KGB).

It could be useful that it supports multiple hashes at the same
file, so that you can have a period of time where you have both,
and that things that know about the newer can already use the
newer one without having to wait for everybody to be ready.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Entropy of a diode 
I'm trying to understand the entropy generated by a reversed diode
in avalanche breakdown mode.  Does anybody know of a paper that
describes it, maybe talk about the distribution of the noise, the
effect of temperature changes, RF interference?
I'm trying to analyze the chaoskey.

They do use a transistor.  I didn't say anything about zener diode.
As far as I understand the transitor or just a normal diode should
have the same effect.
All the schematics and source is available.
noise was being distored.
They have a 12 bit ADC, but it seems that because the reference
voltage of the ADC isn't filtered enough they have some bias is
the lower bits.  I think this is currently causing them to loose 1
or 2 bit of entropy.
But running some statistics on it, they still seem to get just over
8 bit of entropy per sample from the raw input data.
