@_subject: [Cryptography] prism-proof email in the degenerate case 
Ben Laurie  [2013-10-20 09:18]:
alt.anonymous.messages, already mentioned several times in this thread.
"d.nix" spent 4 years analyzing AAM messages using GPU crackers, etc.
"I wanted to follow up on a few comments I saw. I got a message via the
hoi-polloi.org mixmaster node that pointed me to another suite of
software I did not include in my slides. Most of these programs have
been updated in the past few months - so they are actively maintained.
The suite includes:
An AAM checker for checking AAM and checking if you have new messages
(hardcoded subjects or hsubs only, no esubs it appears).
An email-substitute for communicating with a specific person or
persons via nyms and AAM, including automatically setting up your nym
A program that seems to combine the previous two programs into a
generic AAM reader and poster
A cover traffic tool to send dummy Mixmaster messages and dummy AAM
messages from your connection, so someone watching ideally isn't quite
sure which messages you send are legit and which are not."
