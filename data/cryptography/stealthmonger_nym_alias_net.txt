@_subject: PGP "master keys" 
Interesting epilog: theregister has apparently now edited out all
mention of master keys.  In a version downloaded via the Agora
web-to-mail gateway at Sat, 29 Apr 2006 03:42:05 +0900 (JST), the
second sentence reads "PGP says its open source encryption code also
guarantees no back doors."  (full stop)

@_subject: NPR : E-Mail Encryption Rare in Everyday Use 
============================== START ==============================
But you don't have to reveal that you sent him email.  You can use
stealthy communication.
Stealthy communication is communication wherein not only is the
content concealed from eavesdroppers by encryption, but information
about who is communicating with whom, when, or if at all, is
concealed, as well.
The Internet can be used for stealthy communication.  The basic idea
is that each potential participant has ongoing traffic to and from a
message pool which is propagated world-wide.  When the participant has
no live traffic to send, dummy traffic is sent instead.  The dummy
traffic is indistinguishable from the live traffic except by using
decryption keys which are chosen by correspondents.  The outbound
traffic continues autonomously without interruption for months and
years and is not correlated to the live traffic, so an observer
without the keys cannot determine when or how much live communication
is happening.  Inbound cover traffic consists of taking a full feed of
the message pool at all times without interruption.
A Debian Linux package exists which enables stealthy email.  It has
been in everyday use for years, although not widely.  Details on
request.  I am looking for someone to host it.  Any volunteers?

Another reason to use StealthMail -- see package description below.
StealthMail still needs an Internet site.  If you can provide one,
please contact the author.
Package: stealthmail
Description: scripts to hide whether you're doing email, or when, or with whom
 Maintain on-going random cover traffic via usenet newsgroup
 alt.anonymous.messages, substituting encrypted live traffic when
 available.  A live message is indistinguishable from a random cover
 message except with the decryption keys.  All potential participants
 send messages to alt.anonymous.messages with rigid periodicity
 uncorrelated with any live traffic, and maintain an uninterrupted
 full feed from alt.anonymous.messages, so that an observer cannot
 determine whether, when, or among whom live communication is
 happening.

No.  Ever hear of Chaum's "Dining Cryptographers" [1]?  Anonymity
right there at the table.  Been around for almost twenty years.
Strong anonymity is available today using chains of random-latency,
mixing, anonymizing remailers based on mixmaster [2], of which there
is a thriving worldwide network [3].
Tor is indicted by its own documentation:
   ... for low-latency systems like Tor, end-to-end traffic
   correlation attacks [8, 21, 31] allow an attacker who can observe
   both ends of a communication to correlate packet timing and volume,
   quickly linking the initiator to her destination. [4]
