@_subject: Security of Mac Keychain, File Vault 
The white paper for Mac Marshal ( ) leads me to believe that the so-called vulnerability in File Vault  is that the encryption is based on the user's chosen login password:
"So, FileVault is not as secure as simple 128-bit AES. Any means of  obtaining the user?s login password or the FileVault Master recovery  keychain will allow access to the FileVault image."
Does this surprise anyone?
