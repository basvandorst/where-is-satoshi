I see the rules do not apply to things in the "public domain" viz   "The
DSGL contains a number of exemptions that can apply to technology that may
otherwise be controlled. These include technology that is::
   - 'in the public domain' - if the technology is already available to the
   public, for example, in publications, product brochures and public blogs,
   websites, podcasts or databases, then it is not controlled. This exemption
   applies to all software and technology in the DSGL;"
