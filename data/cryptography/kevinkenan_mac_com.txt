@_subject: Enterprise key management systems? 
What are people using for enterprise key management systems? By enterprise I mean something (centralized) which supports multiple crypto-enabled applications.
Specifically, are there any recommended products which support crypto hardware and database encryption?
Most people I've talked to seem to roll-their-own. Is that also the consensus of this list?
