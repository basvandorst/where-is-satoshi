@_subject: CCM Mode 
I would like to draw your attention to a relatively new document:
It contains a specification for an authenticated encryption mode.  It was designed fro use with AES, but, of course, it will work with any 128-bit block cipher.
The authors have submitted it to NIST for consideration as a FIPS mode.  You can learn more about CCM and the other proposed modes at the NIST web site ( see  ).
IEEE 802.11 has chosen to make CCM the mandatory to implement AES mode for wireless LAN encryption. IEEE 802.15 has also chosen CCM for use with personal area networks.  In my opinion, this success is due to the lack of a patent (or pending patent from the authors) on CCM.  I suspect that most of the members of this list are aware that other candidate authenticated encryption modes are encumbered.
It is my intention to publish draft-housley-ccm-mode-00.txt as an Informational RFC.
