@_subject: AES timing attacks, why not "whiten" the implementation? 
Can you destroy the relationship between key contents and timing without hurting average run time?
Each round of AES has sixteen table lookups. If you permute the order in which  the implementation does the lookups, then you get a completely different pattern of cache hits and misses. If you permute the order of lookups in a key-independent fashion for every encryption operation then each key has 16! or almost 21 trillion possible timings.
If I'm not making sense in English, schematic pseudocode would look like
Let indirection_array=random permutation of (0..15)
For i = 0 to 15
Let j = indirection_array[i]
Let mixcolumns_input[j] = subbytesandshiftrows_array[state[j]]
End for
Let newstate = mixcolumns(mixcolumnsinput)
End do_round

the permutation generated?
Good questions, which probably require empirical answers. The added cost of this particular whitening approach (question 3) is the cost of shuffling an array plus, I'd expect more important, the cost of replacing 44+ bits of randomness (log2(16!)).
How often you can afford to rearrange table access is a question much like how often you can afford rekeying. The attacker still gets information from timing, of course (question 1), but it's information about the pair {key, table access permutation}. If you had unlimited entropy available you could re-permute on every encryption or decryption. The minimum frequency would depend on how many trials your attacker needs in order to nail down a key.
The questions I don't know how to answer are
(a) How many bits worth of confusion does this really add for an attacker? There must be symmetries such that some subsets of permutations will have identical cache timings. The answer to (a) determines the answer to (2).
(b) Is there a better way to scramble the timing of an AES operation without going to the last resort of padding everyting to worst-case timing?

We  have no real-world studies how
    users make their day-to-day trust decisions when using the Internet.
We do have a beginning, in the study done by Garfinkel, Miller and Wu at MIT
It's lab data so not strictly "real-world", and was really aimed at
checking the effectiveness of anti-phish toolbars (low), but it spun
off some interesting observations that don't contradict anything from
the field. A sample quote: "17 subjects (85%) mentioned in the
interview that the web content looked professional or similar to what
they had seen before."
That paper's list of references is also a useful place to look for
material about trust decisions, especially the Fogg et.al. paper "What
makes Web sites credible?:a report on a large quantitative study". CHI
2001, pp. 61-68.
