@_subject: Swedish crypto & math mailinglist 
Hi I'd like to send announce a new mailinglist:
Basicly it is a swedish mailinglist where anything which is math or
cryptography is on topic. The list is very new and have few subscribers,
so feel free to change that... Currently there have been some mails
regarding designing cryptographic open source hardware blocks in VHDL,
which I plan to participate in this summer, and some rather basic math.
