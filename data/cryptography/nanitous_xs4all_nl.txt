Why not designed your system around StringBuffer rather than String. It has the advantage that its access is synchronized. If you need the access speed (which I sincerely doubt), use StringBuilder, its functionality is similar to StringBuffer, but not sync'ed.
Using which interface?

Hi Ian,
Probably stating the obvious, but it appears that Java Swing already provides a Swing component for passwords including a note how to erase the content of a pwd holding variable asap:
And it returns pwds in a char[] to boot! I wouldn't use byte[] to store user input, rather char[], because you don't want to handle all possible input methods like German, Dutch, English, Arabic, Traditional and Simplified Chinese. If you insist on using byte[], there are plenty of ways to do it right and quick.
