@_subject: How the Greek cellphone network was tapped. 
Mobile phones have had spare cycles for doing strong crypto for a very long time. There are two classes of reasons why this is not happening and is (unfortunately) never going to happen:
1. Practically no users ask for it, so the handset vendors prefer to use development resources to build even more flashy features, rather than allocate resources to developing E2E security. No user would ever brag about how secure their phone is, but they would brag about how they can play video games or take pictures or whatever, or how small it is.
2. E2E crypto on mobiles would require cross-vendor support, which would mean that it would have to go into the standard.  Unfortunately, standards in the mobile world are heavily influenced by governmnets, and the four horsemen of the apocalypse (drug dealers, paedophiles, spies, and terrorists) are still being used by government types to nix any attempts at crypto they can't break or intercept.
Unfortunately, it's not so easy to roll your own on top of a 3G-enabled smartphone. The "broadband" channel does not have the tight jitter and throughput guarantees that voice needs, and some providers (Verizon in the USA for example) consider running voice traffic over their "broadband" network a violation of the usage agreement (no need to blame the government for that, their own greed is adequate explanation). There are lots of other technical and human-factors issues that have been covered to great extent in this and other fora.

There is some verification involved, as the processor won't just accept random bytes.

As the discussion so far indicates, and as published papers show, the
security of these "security questions" is lower than the security of
the password.
Can you reference it please?  There has been some analysis on the entropy of passphrases as a password replacement, but it is not relevant.
The difference is that when you are interfacing with a human, you have to go through a low-speed interface, namely, voice. In that respect,
a security question, coupled with a challenge about recent transactions,
makes for adequate security.  The on-line version of the security question is vulnerable to automated dictionary attacks.

It took a major attack (allegedly) by the Chinese for Google to start

It makes sense in another perverse sort of way: so long as users are

will always be far easier ways for criminals to victimize users than to
break the crypto. So why bother fixing the crypto? It's not the most

 Frankly, I'd rather see big companies spend resources on how to train
their users NOT to believe scammers (they seem to be doing the opposite by
telling you to turn off various security features so you can install their

cert-pinning in Chrome, and warnings on suspicious email messages, but

Lots of tin-foil-hattery in there. If there is one thing Google takes
seriously, it's protecting their users' data against everyone (everyone
outside Google, that is), often at great expense.
It pains me to defend Google, but that is the truth.

a possibly implied requirement that you do not state is that the device be
about as portable as the enigma. Is it?
If your communication requirements are, for example, between a land station
an a U-Boat, the device doesn't have to be so small.
The LFSR parts of A5/1 can easily be implemented with relay logic, and
Vernam's design from his1919 patent can be used to combine it with the data
the hardware requirements to cryptanalyse A5/1 are definitely beyond the
capabilities of 1940s technology.
You can use relay logic / ladder logic and crossbar switches to implement a
feistel cipher

Very cute. And while this particular case does not (should not?) have any

using stuff in ways it was not meant to be used, which is unfortunately
all-too-common in our field.
A bit off-topic: I particularly like how you use python examples, with

You are addressing crypto professionals here. Don't you think we
already know this?
If the secret you are protecting is valuable enough, there are lots of
ways to uncover it. Read up about decapping chips with nitric acid,
micromanipulators, and other such fun stuff. If you want to get a bit
fancier, read up on FIBs. If your secret is worth more than $100, you
should really spend at least that much protecting it.
The part about freezing the firmware is valid, but even then, you have
to balance that against the need to do firmware upgrades for when bugs
are discovered.
The most valuable part of medical devices is not the code. It's the
process of getting them approved for medical use.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Determining TLS session keys from the hypervisor 
It took someone *this* long to do this? If you are running under a
hypervisor, or in any sort of virtualized environment, the hosting
side is god. Just like you don't run stuff on the bare metal if you
are in a colo facility and don't trust the security of your cage. Or
try to hide from the superuser in a timeshared machine (you are old
enough to know what that is :) ).  And so on.
An interesting question is what the hypervisor *provider* can do to
assure you that they are not messing with your memory. IOW, what
hypervisor-software/processor-architecture can provide that guarantee.
Simply doing remote attestation on the hypervisor would not work, as
you can't to trust the boot code if you can't trust the hv.
FWIW, AWS provides VMs with HSMs. They cost a pretty penny, and they
are guaranteed to run on non-multi-tenant hardware.

What is preventing all this from happening is most certainly not a lack of
an appropriate cryptographic container format (nor is it a dearth of free
disk space, for that matter).
There are way too many software engineering and people engineering issues,
and lots of partial solutions, but it is not a cryptography problem so I
shall refrain from discussing it any further. There are appropriate fora
for such discussions.

I haven't contributed, but I use it for some non-critical services. I like
the fire-and-almost-forget approach, and in particular how it will
temporarily run its own mini-server to pull the certs and put them in the
right place. I don't mind taking the corresponding service down for a few
seconds every few months to renew the cert the easy way, but they do
provide recipes for how to set up things like nginx to do it automatically.
I'll let someone else rant about the current state of affairs wrt CAs and
what they will do for money :)

"Piles" as in "haemorrhoids"? :)
While I do not disagree that Unicode is an abomination, it is not Unicode's
fault that the IETF decided that internationalized domain names with native
character sets was a good idea.
We've had these problems problems for a long time, for example with people
confusing an I with an l because MSFT at some point decided that a
sans-serif font was better on the crappy displays of that time, and
everybody is now using sans-serif fonts for email and for browser bars, to
mention only two obvious things that aggravate me. Remember paypa1.com?
The underlying *security* problem is that people trust the name they read.
Or that even if they've read it "correctly" it somehow means something.
That's certainly not Unicode's fault.

where it is much easier to fire someone than it is to admit you are
completely screwed. One of my favorite books, Leo Marks’ "Between Silk and
Cyanide," deals with a similar situation in WW II, though the author
manages not to get fired by knowing when to shut up. Many OSS agents sent
into the Netherlands were captured and executed because managers refused to
believe their network was compromised even though prearranged signals, in
the form of specific message mistakes, were detected by Marks.
That is indeed an amazing book.
The other side was just as stubborn. Dönitz was convinced the allies had
cracked Enigma, but the rest of the brass refused to believe that their
technology was vulnerable (part of the vulnerability was, of course, bad
opsec, as everyone in this list already knows).
