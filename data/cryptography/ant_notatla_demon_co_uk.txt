@_subject: Second Cryptuk Meeting (London, Wednesday 25th April 2001) 
Wed 25th April 2001, 7-9pm
I suggest we grab a table in the lowest level Cellar bar.  These can not
be reserved.
Pete Chown on IPsec: Pervasive Encryption for the Internet?
In the first part I will explain what IPsec is and how it is supposed
to work.  I will explain the three protocols which provide security,
and explain the relationships with other technologies such as DNSsec.
I will then explain how to set up FreeS/WAN under Linux.  I will
explain how to patch your kernel and how to make the FreeS/WAN patch
co-exist with the international kernel patch.  Finally I will explain
how to configure and start FreeS/WAN so as to communicate securely
with another machine.
In the final part I will talk about issues with IPsec, such as
interactions with firewalls, and how IPsec could be used to provide
all-pervasive encryption on the Internet.  I am hoping that this part
of the talk will become more of an "open forum" where ideas can be put
forward; there are real issues here and I don't claim to have all the

I snipped several Cc:s.
The effort to black bag computers of a few hundred people reading AAM
is much more than the effort they spend getting their computers to read
it regularly.  Or post to it if they chose.
So the TLAs also have to figure out which other ISP accounts and phone lines
are also used by the guy they saw reading AAM.   More work for them just to
rule out AAM robots equipped with a few free ISP accounts.
It must be independent of the true traffic volume but "full on all the time"
is overkill.  If an AAM robot posts exactly 50 messages a day that's plenty
to cover as much anonymous communication as I could organise in my head.

Anonymous asks:
When a definition was sought in May 2000 it drew the reply:
Destroying Diffie-Hellman key parameters gets you computational
secrecy; not information-theoretic secrecy.
An expired ID I have stored "Using the SRP protocol as a key exchange
method in Secure Shell" makes no mention of PFS.

@_subject: Thanks, Lucky, for helping to kill gnutella 
Now that is resorting to silly accusation.
My copy of "Peer to Peer" (Oram, O'Reilly) is out on loan but I think Freenet
and Mojo use protocols that require new users to be contributors before they
become consumers.  (Leaving aside that Gnutella seems doomed on scalability
Likewise the WAN shooter games have (partially) defended against cheats by
making the client hold no authoritative data and by disqualifying those
that send impossible traffic.  (Excluding wireframe graphics cards is another
matter.)  If I were a serious gamer I'd want 2 communities - one for plain
clients to match gaming skills and another for "cheat all you like" contests
to match both gaming and programming skills.
If the Gnuts need to rework the protocol they should do so.
My objection to this TCPA/palladium thing is that it looks aimed at ending
ordinary computing.  If the legal scene were radically different this wouldn't
be causing nearly so much fuss.  Imagine:
- a DoJ that can enforce monopoly law
- copyright that expires in reasonable time
     (5 years for s/w ? 15 years for books,films,music... ?)
- fair use and first sale are retained
- no concept of indirect infringement (e.g. selling marker pens)
- criminal and civil liability for incorrectly barring access in DRM
- hacking is equally illegal for everybody
- no restriction on making and distributing/selling any h/w,s/w
If Anonymous presents Gnutella for serious comparison with the above issues
I say he's looking in the wrong end of his telescope.

What's wrong is the backups are presumably encrypted in a way that requires
the cooperation of MS to read it on a machine other than the originator.
I'm not at all likely to become US president but if I were I'd consider
this an issue worth nuking Redmond for in office hours with no warning.

Not completely.
   [copying from Google's cache on that last one]
   The UK supermarket lost the latest round in its fight with the US
   company after a ruling by the EU Court of Justice on Tueday.
   "The court ruled that goods from outside the European economic area
   cannot be imported without the unequivocable consent of the trademark
   owner, and we think that is the right decision," said Levi's Europe
   chief.
   The decision is the latest in the long running and very costly legal
   saga between the two companies. Tesco believes it should have the
   right to sell Levi jeans at knock down prices whereas the jeans
   manufacturer argues it has turned down the supermarket as an approved
   stockist.
   Levi sells its products through 17,000 selected outlets across Europe,
   chosen for good customer service argues the company, price rigging
   argue its pro-consumer opponents.
A further twist in the story is that Levi's plan a discount brand for
Walmart (and perhaps ASDA in UK ?) supermarkets.
It's been reported on this list before that among the security
failings of the play protection was one key being left unencrypted.
I don't know whether Mr. Johansen copied it - but that's not critical
to the end result of producing DeCSS.
