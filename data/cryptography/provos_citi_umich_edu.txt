@_subject: automated detection of steganographic content in images 
I announce the initial release of stegdetect.  Stegdetect is an
automated tool for detecting steganographic content in images.
It is capable of detecting several different steganographic methods to
hide messages in JPEG images.  Currently, the detectable schemes are
jsteg, jphide, and outguess 01.3b.
Stegdetect is covered by a BSD license and should compile and run on
most UNIX-like operating systems.
You can download stegdetect from
  Comments and feedback welcome.
 Niels.

I just released Stegdetect 0.4.  It contains the following changes:
 - Improved detection accuracy for JSteg and JPhide.
 - JPEG Header Analysis reduces false positives.
 - JPEG Header Analysis provides rudimentary detection of F5.
 - Stegbreak uses the file magic utility to improve dictionary
   attack against OutGuess 0.13b.
You can download the UNIX source code or windows binary from
  The results from analyzing one million images from the Internet Archive's
USENET archive are available at
    After scanning two million images from eBay without finding any
  hidden messages, we extended the scope of our analysis.
  This page provides details about the analysis of one million images
  from the Internet Archive's USENET archive.
  Processing the one million images with stegdetect results in about
  20,000 suspicious images. We launched a dictionary attack on the
  JSteg and JPHide positive images.  The dictionary has a size of
  1,800,000 words and phrases.  The disconcert cluster used to
  distribute the dictionary attack has a peak performance of roughly
  87 GFLOPS.
  However, we have not found a single hidden message.
Comments and feedback are welcome.  We have an FAQ at
  Regards and a merry Christmas,

thank you for the kind consideration of our work.
How many images are posted to Usenet every day? I'd say around 50,000
a day, including GIF images and other image file types that we did not
look at [1].
Which USENET archive that stores a full feed from the time before
steganography suddenly hit the limelight of the press would you use?
We had access to a couple of Terra bytes accounting for a few months
of Usenet activity.  Thats what we looked at.
You might have heard that Usenet traffic is mostly for binary data.
That is correct but most of the binary traffic is not in images [2].
If you have any suggestions on how to increase the scope of our
analysis, I would be glad to hear them.  Alternatively, you might
conduct a study yourself as I just released most of my tools.  It
would be interesting to see something more "statistically significant" ;)

We are offering various explanations.  One of them is that there is no
significant use of steganography.  If you read the recent article in
the New York Times [1], you will find claims that "about 0.6 percent
of millions of pictures on auction and pornography sites had hidden
The following slides contain examples of false-positives
    In my experience, eliminating false-positives is not quite that easy.
Some graphs look like they should have steganographic content even
though they do not.  Any test will have a false-positive rate, the
goal is to keep it very low.
Good question.  The panel about the DMCA at the USENIX Security
Symposium seemed to indicate that the exceptions built into the DMCA
have no real meaning.  In my understanding of the American legal and
judicial system, it is not possible to know what is right or wrong
according to some law until one has been taking to court about it.

A new version of stegdetect has been finished.  It features improved
detection of jsteg and jphide - unix and windows versions.  It also
detects content hidden by invisible secrets.
This release also includes xsteg, a graphical front end to stegdetect
that allows for easy manipulation of scanning parameters.

JPHide and OutGuess 0.13b

The study was motiviated by the article in the usa today.  We
assembled a fairly large dicitionary, almost a million words.  In the
discussion, our argument is one of numbers.  If there had been a
significant use of steganography, I should have found it.  That does
not mean that particular hidden messages can not slip past our net.
