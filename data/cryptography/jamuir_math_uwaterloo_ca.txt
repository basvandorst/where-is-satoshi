@_subject: RSA signatures without padding 
There is an attack against this type of RSA signature scheme, although
cannot remember just now if it requires that the verfication exponent be
small (ie. e=3).
The attack I am trying to recall is a chosen-message attack and its
efficiency is related to the probability that a random 128-bit integer can
be factorized over a small set of primes (ie. the prob that a uniformily
selected 128-bit integer is "B-smooth" for a small integer B).  Basically,
you pick a message for which you'd like to forge a signature, find a variant
of the message that hashes to a B-smooth 128-bit integer, and then you
construct the forgery after solving a linear system modulo e (the linear
system incorporates the signatures on the chosen messages).
I can't think of a reference for this but I will post another message if I
find it.
