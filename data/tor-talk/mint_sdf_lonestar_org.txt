Mike, I respectfully disagree. Anyone willing to allow traffic should be node. The tor project homepage makes no 'rules' when it comes to running a node. If you're willing to allow any traffic you're a suitable candidate, apparently in the opinion of the creators of that site and in mine. The fact is that some people are going to do things they shouldn't over *any* node, not just these that APPEAR suspicious. We have no idea why they're restricting access to those ports, even if it's just for logging what others are doing - they're still providing access. I'll use those nodes to read news articles and such, who cares if they log that? Users should understand what makes them secure when it comes to things they're doing across the internet - tor project or anyone participating should have absolutely zero responsibility, or concern, over traffic leaving the network. You can't protect people from their own stupidity. If someone insists on using insecure methods they're simply going to do it. Let's say I was a malicious node operator and I wanted to log a bunch of traffic -- I'm going to set up a node to allow all traffic and log what I can to avoid suspicion and the very thing that is happening on this list!. This is simple logic and I'm sure it's not lost on our *supposed* malicious node owners that we're currently discussing. The point I'm trying to make here is that even if these guys are just saying 'fuck it, I'll just allow 80 and telnet so I can grab accounts' that's no reason to ban them. Users should be responsible for their own security *outside* of the network (and internally when it relates to activities on hidden services for that matter) - we shouldn't assume people are too stupid to know not to login to their bank(for example) over tor using plaintext. I say keep them around and use the hell out of them. If they're logging my hentai pictures well then more power to them - I hope they enjoy!
I realize my opinion doesn't mean a lot as I'm fairly new to this list  but there it is. (I'm not one of these exit operators btw as I would certainly allow all traffic)

Furthermore I would like to add that if I ran an exit I *might* just not put contact info on it. I don't see the issue unless it's rejecting traffic and I'm screwing up the network. Even if it was I'd figure it out eventually. I wouldn't want you weirdos emailing me anyway ;)

Greg, the site encourages you to download and install the software tor package. It comes with no 'license' or established rules as is. This is a fact. There are no requirements to me running a node. If I wanted to set one up that logged maliciously I could tell you right here in this message and not publish it - not counting that you could check for newly established nodes there would be absolutely nothing you could do about it. This lack of control implies consent for an operator to do anything they wish in my opinion.
The chances of having your traffic logged by malicious operators, known or unknown, allowing traffic on 443 or not, can be minimized by not using Just saying! :-)

I don't see why any of this really matters. Anyone running tor should have the good sense to realize that if you login to webmail.example.com over plaintext then the node operator could grab your details. It states this repeatedly on torproject IIRC. Furthermore anything really important like financial logins are typically done over SSL anyway. If some guy gets his facebook account hijacked because he didn't read the FAQ I don't see the issue. Just my measly two cents.
