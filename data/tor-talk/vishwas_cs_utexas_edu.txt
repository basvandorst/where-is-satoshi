@_subject: write event on a connection 
The conn_write_callback is the callback for the write event on a connection. When does a write event occur on a connection? Is there any documentation from where I can understand which event occur and how?

@_subject: write event on a connection 
I am trying to know about the procedure involved when a connection wants to write data i.e. which functions are called. I have failed to get any documentation on this subject.
