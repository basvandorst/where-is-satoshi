@_subject: [tor-talk] Run Multiple Mac Vidalia/Tor Bundle Apps? 
Is it possible to run multiple Vidalia/Tor bundles on Mac OS?
I've been trying to figure this out, and the biggest obstacle I'm running
into is that Vidalia always seems to look for it's configuration file at:
It seems like this would work as long as I can give each instance there own
configuration files, but right now they are all trying to read the same
file. Is there a way to change this? Do I need to change it in the source?
Any thoughts/help? Thanks in advance.
