@_subject: [tor-talk] Why the Web of Trust Sucks 
Mike Perry transcribed 6.8K bytes:
Actually, this only works, given that Edward has *ultimate* trust in
Bruce. Most people only give ultimate trust to keys which they control.
See the options for the 'auto-key-locate' settings, specifically 'pka',
'cert', 'keyserver-URL', and 'ldap'. Don't ask me how the LDAP one works, I've
never messed with it.
1. DNS PKA
   For the DNS PKA setting, you'd need to add a TXT record to your DNS. [1][2]
   To see mine, do "host -t TXT isis._pka.patternsinthevoid.net". It looks
   like in my zone file:
   isis._pka       14400   TXT "v=pka1;fpr=0A6A58A14B5946ABDE18E207A3ADB67A2CDB8B35;uri=
   It unfortunately doesn't work if the specified URI is HTTPS, but it does
   work with crappy old protocols like finger. Go figure. However, there is
   some of the functionality you want, if you also add "pka-lookups
   pka-trust-increase" to the "verify-options" setting in gpg.conf (doing so
   would automatically increase your trustdb calculation for that key, if it
   has a DNS PKA TXT record and that the fingerprint specified there matches
   the fingerprint on the key you already have).
   Also, a warning: gpg totally disrespects any proxy settings for DNS
   resolutions. The only way around this (safe in my tests so far, which have
   been going for almost a year now) is to resolve the domain of whatever
   keyserver you use, and then use it's IP address instead. For example, in my
   gpg.conf, it goes like this (for hkps://keys.indymedia.org)[3]:
   keyserver hkps://204.13.164.120
   keyserver-options verbose verbose verbose include-revoked include-disabled no-auto-key-retrieve no-honor-keyserver-url no-honor-pka-record include-subkeys no-include-attributes ca-cert-file=~/scripts/certs/keys.indymedia.org http-proxy=socks://127.0.0.1:59050
   Also, using HTTPS or HKPS generally doesn't work, or is a huge pain in the
   ass to get working. These people still use finger, for fucks sake. I don't
   think they've heard the word "privacy" before.
2. DNS CERT
   Essentially the same as DNS PKA, but you need to compile GnuPG, including
   the tools/ subdirectory to get the make-dns-cert script. This actually puts
   your GPG key in a DNS TYPE37 record, [4] and (I think?) it works the same as
   DNS PKA for the trust increase stuff.
3. Preferred Keyserver notation packets
   For the '--auto-key-locate keyserver-URL' setting, see also the
   'preferred-keyserver-url' setting, which adds a Preferred Key Server
   notation packet [0] to all signatures and certifications. For example,
   looking at the last commit I made on BridgeDB (I sign all my commits):
    * commit 44606980d4674548048e164106cf2d2e73cd6a08 (HEAD, tpo-isis/feature/9199-improved-logging-2-r2

   A normal gpg client would use    as the keyserver for updating and re-fetching my key. (The push updates
   don't work so well, I just get a denied resource in my webserver logs,
   which get shredded like every three hours or something.)
   To see all the extra crap on my signature on this email...you'd need to do
   "gpg --verify-options show-policy-urls show-notations show-user-notations
   show-keyserver-urls pka-lookups pka-trust-increase --verify
   ".
This already exists, see the 'ca-cert-file' option under 'keyserver-options'
in the gpg man page. It seems like a bad idea to hardcode it, because then I'm
dependent upon Werner Koch to update the code when the cert for
keys.mayfirst.org or keys.indymedia.org changes (and then also dependent upon
the distro maintainer of gpg to backport the patches, if I were to use a
packaged version).
Also see my above note under "1. DNS PKA" above, on HKPS/HTTPS keyservers.
Alright, but your problems are GnuPG-centric, and there are other ways of
checking trust paths. Try wotsap, lysator, [5] or footsie. [6] Just because
GnuPG and the most of the keyservers are exceptionally outdated (and IMO
crappy to begin with), doesn't mean that the WOT model is broken. I mean,
sure, it's centralised, hard to understand, requires trust-on-first-use, is
prone to all kinds of timing correlations attacks and enables social network
graphing. But that doesn't mean it's broken, right?
You know what, Mike Perry? I think you're just jealous that all the other Tor
developers are in the Strong Set. You know, we could put you in the Strong Set
pretty fast, I could put that cronjob back... :D [7]
I'm conflicted. I think GnuPG is a piece of shit, and that it's actively
hindering security via the difficulty of its use. GnuPG means that I can't
safely talk to my mom; I hate the thing. And I hate the WOT, just as much as
you do, if not proportionally more given my familiarity with it.
Fuck it. It's broken.  Not for the reasons you've listed, though. I think for
the most part the problems you mention are GnuPG-centric and I've invalidated
a good chunk of them (not excusing the GnuPG implementation of the OpenPGP
spec, which could likely be re-implemented in a substantially more robust and
user-friendly way). I think it's broken only because my mom's been coding
since before I was born and she can't fucking use the damned thing.
Somebody please write a replacement. One, two, three, not it. Or give Pond a
decent peer review. [8]

This should be fixed (for Linux) in an upcoming Tor Browser 4.0 release. I've
added these things to the `start-tor-browser` script. There are:
    - Instructions for use, including additional Firefox preferences that
      you'll need to set (to tell Tor Button where your ControlPort and
      SocksPort are, etc.)
    - An "easy" spot in the `start-tor-browser` script to put in your
      ControlPort password so that it is given to the Firefox process (but not
      exported, because then other programs might be able to steal it)
    - A line will print to your terminal telling you that you're using a
      system-installed Tor.
See  [0] and this commit [1] containing the changes. If you're running
Linux and would like to test these, nightly builds are available. [2]
Contributions to improve this, i.e. automatically setting the preferences for

Hey Patrick!
Thanks for the thanks, and for the code review!
tl;dr: I've never used that devscript before. Neat, thanks! You're actually
correct that `/bin/bash` doesn't need to be there, because my changes which
required it [0] were reverted for TB-4.0-alpha-1 [1] due to the concerns
(mostly the fault of HTTPSEverywhere logging URIs) raised by Robert Ransom on
ticket  [2] (although they are still in 3.6.x). To read more about why I
wrote this crazy code, read on. :)
I think I probably know most of the bashisms, like `[` being a command, you
can still `exec 3<>/dev/tcp/fyb.patternsinthevoid.net/80` to open a TCP
connection even if there isn't a `/dev/tcp`, [3] doing `echo '-e'` doesn't
echo anything because echo is a broken piece of crap... I can keep going. :)
Bash is messed up. Usually, I know how to convert bash syntax to shell, but
there are a couple builtins in particular which don't really have a shell
Normally, I would not want to switch to bash due to portability issues, as you
point out (and unstable syntax and behaviour between bash versions). But the
the particular bashism that I needed in this case, there isn't any equivalent
(to my knowledge) in shell: the `disown` builtin. It's used in the very last
stanzas that I added to the start-tor-browser script:
for second in `seq 1 15` ; do
    sleep 1
    if `kill -0 $pid 2>&1 >/dev/null ` ; then
        wait "$pid"
        exitcode="$?"
        printf "Tor Browser exited suddenly! Exit code: %s\n" "$exitcode"
        exit "$exitcode"
    else
        continue
    fi
if test -z "${exitcode}" ; then
    if test -z "$(kill -0 $pid 2>&1 >/dev/null)" ; then
        printf "Running Tor Browser process (PID %s) in background...\n" "$pid"
        disown "$pid"
        exitcode="0"
    else
        exitcode="66" # Something odd happened
    fi
exit "$exitcode"
For additional reasoning behind this crazy code, see my commit message. [0]
Hmm, like most static analysis tools, it seems like it's not really doing a
good job at taking overall context into account:
  1. There are plenty of cases where I *do* want ${ to glob and split words,
     that's *why* there's no quotes around it.
  2. It doesn't seem to know about `test -t` syntax to test if a file
     descriptor is opened on a terminal.
  3. And it seems to be confused on the difference between $(...) and `...`
     syntax. $(...) is evaluated at access time (if unquoted), `...` is
     evaluated immediately. There's a good Bash Hackers article on this [4]
     (the writer actually concludes on the $(...) side of things too, like the
     shellcheck tool), but I really think it's a style preference. I could
     easily argue that because:
         $( (ls) )
     and
         $((ls))
     are entirely different commands, that therefore $(...) syntax is
     confusing and tricky and should be considered deprecated. Also, while
     `...` doesn't handle nested backticks nicely, its *real* POSIX equivalent
     "$(...)"  (with quotes) doesn't handle nested double-quotes nicely. :)
Though `shellcheck` is actually pointing out some valid mistakes. I'll have to
ask Mike Perry and the rest of the Tor Browser Team what they want done with
that. (I think there were some major changes planned, and the
start-tor-browser script is going to deprecated/replaced?)
Either way, you seem really knowledgable about shell scripting, if you wanted
to contribute to Tor Browser, using your skills on all the bash/shell in the
the tor-browser-bundle repo [5] would be a great way to start.
In the case of the old (pre TB-3.6.2, before my crazy `wait` code above),
possibly. But doing so would obviously mean that the `firefox` process and its
environment would replace the shell. This means that when the `firefox`
process dies, the shell would disappear (along with any advice, errors, logs
which had been logged to it, since the old version doesn't log to file).
In the versions which do have my crazy code, that crazy code wouldn't get run,
because there wouldn't be a shell to run it any longer. I felt that the crazy
code was necessary, as it gives error messages for the potential cases where
Firefox couldn't start because it was already running, couldn't start period,
exited unexpectedly, or couldn't be disowned for some reason. In all cases, my
crazy code *should* handle dealing with hung, non-existent, errored,
etc. Firefox processes, and then it *should* always exit the shell, which (to
my understanding) is pretty much the reason one is supposed to `exec` a
wrapped process, so that an extra (sub)shell process isn't left lying around.
I could be entirely wrong, though, and perhaps there is some fancy `exec`
syntax which takes care of the processes errors. (If there is, I'd be stoked
to learn about it!)
That sounds great! Just be sure to explain weird shellisms and bashisms with
code comments or commit messages.
I also see you have an (somewhat) old tbb-scripts repo. [6] I've got a bunch
of random hacky tor-related scripts too, for setting up transproxies and
catching GFW garbage probes, [7] verifying gitian builder scripts, [8] doing
all your DNS on a remote Tor relay (through tor, with DNSSEC validation and
caching), [9] etc. I know Ximin's (infinity0) got some nice hacky scripts too,
and meejah, perhaps we should all join forces and create a tor-hacks repo?

Mike Fikuart transcribed 4.8K bytes:
This is an interesting idea. Variants using random walks through nodes which
only know a random subset of other nodes have been proposed before, e.g.
MorphMix. [0]
However, it should be impossible to verify that a given sequence is, in fact,
random, rather than being a sequence in seeded such a way that it is
predictable, or an encrypted sequence, etc. The biggest concern with improving
Tor's scalability via handing out random samples of nodes from the consensus
would then be that malicious Directories (whether Authorties or simply
mirrors) could collude to hand out predictable subsets of relays to some/all
Further, even if we could verify that a given sample was truly random, and we
checked the results for some subset of clients, this would not prohibit
certain clients from being lied to. I would argue that the security of the
group of all Tor clients is only as good as the worst case scenario, i.e. any
mechanism which would allow a single client to subjet to targeted attacks is
an attack against all.
Nicholas Hopper and Nikita Borisov are two of the more significant researchers
who explore scaling specifically for Tor and/or onion routing in general.
Perhaps some of the following may help give you an idea of the extant research
in this area:
For a more detailed explanation of why random subsets of nodes cannot be used
to securely pick an unbiased path (more specifically, why we won't use most
DHT algorithms, or the Salsa/Cashmere DHT-overlays), see "Hashing it out in
Public". [1]
For an interesting proposal for using some specific DHT algorithms which claim
to keep maintain the current levels of security while providing better
scalability, see the Torsk paper. [2]
And for a Private Information Retrieval (PIR) based approach (admittedly, I
haven't read it yet, but it's been on my reading list for a while!), which,
like other PIR systems would permit DHT-like queries albeit without the
Directory being able to know what is being looked up, see the PIR-Tor
paper. [3] However, I think I recall from my skimming that the lookups
produced *routes*, not nodes... which is worrisome for another set of reasons.

Only somewhat tangential, I still believe we shouldn't be mincing terms: a
consensus is full agreement without any blockers, whereas what Tor uses is
merely a democratic vote. Consensus-based decision making and democracy are
such different beasts that I might fight for the prior, yet would nearly
always denounce the latter as majoritarianist fascism-in-disguise.

Eugen Leitl transcribed 5.8K bytes:
Hi. I maintain and develop BridgeDB.
For what it's worth, the released XKS rules would not have worked against
BridgeDB for over a year now. I have no knowledge of what regexes are
currently in use in XKS deployments, nor if the apparent typos are errors in
the original documents, or rather typos in one of the various levels of
transcriptions which may have occurred in the editing process. If these typos
were at some point in the original rules running on XKS systems, then *no*
bridges would have been harvested due to various faults. None.
Ergo, as Jacob has pointed out to me, the regexes which are released should be
assumed to be several years out of date, and also shouldn't be assumed to be
representative of the entire ruleset of any deployed XKS system.
I am willing to implement tricks against specific problems with them, mostly
for the lulz, because fuck the NSA. But it should be assumed that the actual
regexes have perhaps been updated, and that highly specific tricks are not
likely to land.
The ticket for this, by the way, was created by Andrea this afternoon, it's
 Interesting. I'm glad someone else is paying that close of attention to these
regexes. I'd totally take a patch which implements the BridgeDB equivalent of
little Bobby'); DROP TABLE Students.  Granted, as I said above, it likely won't land. But for the lulz. :)

The format is best described in torspec.git/pt-spec.txt, [0] given as:
[["Bridge"] SP] [[METHOD] SP] IP:PORT [SP [FINGERPRINT]] [[[K=V] "," [[K=V] ","]] ?]
BridgeDB currently doesn't include the "Bridge" prefix (and hasn't for just
upwards of one year now) due a backwards-compatibility issue with Vidalia. [1]
Meaning that a correctly formed bridge line currently looks like this:
obfs4 1.2.3.4:11111 abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01 sekrit=fu,password=bar
TorLauncher is smart about this, and if a bridge line (such as this one)
doesn't start with "Bridge", then TorLauncher rewrites the line before adding
it to the user's torrc file:
Bridge obfs4 1.2.3.4:11111 abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01 sekrit=fu,password=bar
The same obviously happens when configuring bridges in Tails, because Tails
now uses TorLauncher. The biggest problem we've seen here is that users cannot
correctly/accurately type a bridge's fingerprint.
I agree with Sebastian and Matthew. I'm not willing to deploy something which
makes it more difficult for legitimate Tor users to obtain/utilise
bridges. It's already difficult enough to correctly type a fingerprint.
There are plans to move towards implementing rBridge [2], which would allow
legitimate users to receive new bridges automatically and anonymously. There
is, however, no funding for this work. Either way, due to implementation
difficulty (largely due to certain prerequisite cryptographic primitives of
the anonymous authentication scheme) and integration with Tor Browser, this
will take me and the other volunteers quite some time. Give or take, 2-3

simonsnake at openmailbox.org transcribed 2.2K bytes:
Couple points of clarity:
The QUANTUM program, which is actually a family of
attack vectors developed by the TAO division of the NSA, actually
mainly allows for packet injection, i.e. inserting a cloned and/or
modified TCP packets or HTTP request/responses with source spoofing
which beats the original packet to its final destination. [0]
There are several programs which allow for the possibility of traffic
analysis, one of which is XKEYSCORE (XKS). [1] Several of these
programs interface with programs such as those in QUANTUM. Traffic
analysis programs aren't "data collections things"; [2] instead, they
run pre-collected traffic through a complex series of rulesets in
order classify the traffic for further processing by other programs,
or for storage in a database.
An example flow for the way an email to bridges at torproject.org might
be processed would be:
 0. The outgoing email from your Gmail account is captured by PRISM,
     or a related/similar traffic surveillance program.
 1. The captured email is processed by XKEYSCORE.
    1a. The email matches the XKEYSCORE ruleset as being an email to
        bridges at torproject.org (published in the Das Erste article you
        linked to above).
        1a. i. Your outgoing email to bridges at torproject.org, possibly
               along with other associated information, is stored in a
      	       database.
        1a.ii. Other processing can happen at this point, if there are
               additional matching XKEYSCORE rules defined on the
               XKEYSCORE system processing your traffic.
    1b. The email doesn't matches any XKEYSCORE ruleset.
        1b. i. UNKNOWN. We don't know yet what is done with the
               captured traffic at this point.
Dynamism, to the extent that it prevents geolocation, in IPv4 address
assignment is mostly a thing of the past. I'm usually able to
accurately track an IPv4 address down to the city, and I'm sure they
can do much better.
What they achieve is the ability to accuse a person in the future
based on that person's browsing/usage history. Why is this dangerous?
For the US, the Congressional Research Service has stated that they do
not know the precise number of federal crimes in effect in a region at
a given time. Ergo, one could assume that if the number of these laws
is unknown, their contents are likewise unknown. And therefore, not
even a good lawyer knows off the top of her head if her client is
doing something illegal. And then take into account that laws in the
US are interpreted by historical precedence, and it now also matters
when that person is accused of doing something. You have NO IDEA if
anything you are doing is legal or illegal. There is an excellent
lecture by a Regent Law Professor explaining more. [3]
Anyone who has regularly contracted or actively volunteered with Tor
has likely had quite some experience with spooks, not only Roger;
though, Roger is probably a bit nicer when he talks to them than some
others of us.
I've contracted to the Tor Project for four years and volunteered some
before that. I've spoken to senators and representatives on Capitol
Hill, [4] as well as other agencies, regarding my work. The State
Dept. has mentioned work by OONI that I had contributed to during one
of their morning televised briefings. [5]
The behaviours of the various branches and departments of the US
federal goverment is, in my opinion (my views do not necessarily
express those my employer's), like that of a two-year-old with
Multiple Personality Disorder. They only rarely accurately comprehend
the scope and impact of a technology, e.g. I've been asked by
congressional aides if the tools I contribute to "are for other
countries, or for the US?"  They seem to think there are borders on
the internet. Many of its personalities are often in direct conflict
with one another. Some of its personalities are downright sociopathic
and strive mainly for selfish ends via means which harm the
overwhelming majority of people worldwide, both US persons and
otherwise. In my opinion, the NSA, the FBI, and the CIA are prime
examples of the US federal government's sociopathic personalities.
As someone else mentioned in this thread, the official task of the NSA
is to monitor communications: "collects, processes, and disseminates

counterintelligence purposes and to support military operations."  The
NSA is also tasked with "preventing foreign adversaries from gaining
access to sensitive or classified national security information". [6]
Weakening the security of systems, while simultaneously preventing
others from accessing them, would make it appear as if the NSA is
actually in direct conflict with itself.
Additionally, the NSA is in direct conflict with the missions of
several other departments, e.g. the State Dept.'s aims to protect
U.S. citizens living/travelling abroad and assist U.S. companies in
the international marketplace, and likely several other Department's

Seth David Schoen transcribed 3.2K bytes:
Yep, the idea is pretty old. A variant of it was even written up into
RFC1751 in 1994. [0] That one is already in the pycrypto module, [1]
at `Crypto.Util.RFC1751`. It encoded a fingerprint into 30 words with
maximal length of 4 characters each:
'CANT FLUB GLOB BURN LEA OW PA COD GLEN NILE WRY HUNT CANT GUSH GLOW CENT LAM LOFT RAP HO GYP DENY CARL HUE CANT FIVE ANNA CREW LYE HUG'
FWIW, Leif's Bananaphone (SSH-over-Markov-Chains) tool [2] would also
work for this purpose, also more efficiently than Zimmermann's PGP
wordlist; I was able to get an encoded fingerprint easily down to 28
words, each word between 2-7 characters:
?!isis?wintermute:~ ? egrep -x '\w{2,7}' /usr/share/dict/words > fingerprint-corpus.txt
?!isis?wintermute:~ ? wc -l fingerprint-corpus.txt
31082 fingerprint-corpus.txt

?!isis?wintermute:(master>)~/code/torproject/bananaphone ? cat test1 | \
  python ./banaphone.py pipeline 'rh_decoder("words,sha1,12")'
An additional benefit to using Bananaphone would be that it doesn't
require the client-side (the TorLauncher side) to have the corpus (the
`fingerprint-corpus.txt` file, in the above example). Also, because of
this, BridgeDB could easily use Spanish, Arabic, etc. corpuses for
users who are perhaps unfamiliar with English words.
This, however, would mean that we'd need Banaphone written in JS.
This is a great idea.
The un-translation of the encoded fingerprint would likely need to
happen in either little-t tor or in TorLauncher.
I'm willing to take a patch to BridgeDB's UI templates to optionally
encode the fingerprint as a list of words, though I would prefer the
default display to give the actual fingerprint.
And I spoke briefly to Mike Perry about the possibility of including
such a decoder in TorLauncher. Mike said he's willing to merge the
patches, but unwilling to force the Pearl Crescent hackers (who
wrote/maintain TorLauncher) to use their time implementing this.
There is the possibility that, in the future, one of Tor's regular
funders will be sponsoring a thing called "Tor Challenge", which is
where Tor Project people point at small projects which require less
expertise yet which they would really like to see done, then someone
wanting to help out comes along and does whatever that small project
is and gets to collect the funding allotted to that Challenge. I'd
gladly add this to my list of things I want done.
Also an interesting idea. But what if they type the checksum wrong?

TorBrowser is patched to block attempts by websites to access HTML5 canvases,
since there isn't much legitimate purpose for a site to do this, other than to
track you as that article you linked points out.
However, if you've already clicked the "Allow in the Future" button on the

this, there isn't currently an easy way to revoke the permission you gave. [0]
Additionally, there appears to be an issue in nsIPermissionManager (used by

For now, my best advice is to be very careful allowing any site to access
HTML5 canvases until we make it easier to revoke the permission. (In other

I agree that this should be done outside Orbot, for several reasons that I'm
not going to get dragged into again. And FWIW, Mike's blog post on Android
security specifically recommends setting up DroidWall (a similar AOS
iptables-based firewall app) with some bash scripts to log and deny all leaky
traffic from Orbot.
My primary concern would be regarding whether Torrific's iptables rules are
applied ASAP after Orbot starts Tor, and I actually can't recommend anything
there (short of building a new initramfs which enforces starting the firewall
from there, early during the boot process).
DroidWall already has a mechanism for running user-specified scripts at
startup... Perhaps the most portable way to do what you're trying to do would
be to add a similar script-sourcing mechanism to AFWall? Then you could simply
maintain a repo of startup scripts which (hopefully) work for any Android
firewall app which supports this mechanism.

 2) Verifiable DKIM signatures on the user's outgoing emails. I've long been in favour of removing Yahoo from the accepted providers. [1]

Thanks, I'm aware of the difficulties.
I don't think a SIM card is the epitome of Sybil-proof

on ticket  costs $0.005 a piece. A SIM card doesn't prove you're a
unique human any more than 0.001 Satoshi proves you're human or solving N
CAPTCHAs proves you're human. I am increasingly convinced that the only way to
determine if a human is a unique human is to ask said human's friends. As you
can imagine, doing this without retaining a social graph of users is quite a
non-trivial task. And FWIW, the system most of us want to see implemented for
bridge distribution doesn't exactly have the most implementable
cryptography. [0] :/
Though perhaps you missed what I mentioned earlier: You can use Riseup
now. They don't require a phone, and I consider their form of social
verification to be the most secure way to authenticate strangers in any
currently-deployed system. It's got what activist groups have required for
years to combat snitches and feds AFK: convince a few real people that you're
a trustworthy friend, or convince a live human that you're useful and not a
parasite of some sort. There's no other proof-of-work system which is

that the modifying a firewall requires root access, and as Orbot handles
controlling the underlying tor process and interacting with other apps such as
the browser, the QRcode scanner, etc. the attack surface is greatly increased
by giving root to Orbot when (to my knowledge) it's only needed to control the
firewall. The app which handles all those other actions doesn't need root, and

Casey Rodarmor transcribed 2.0K bytes:
Hello Casey,
We're currently discussing that the above page should be updated to about
250KB/s. [0]
The problem is this: All clients fetch information about all the relays in the
network from the Directory Authorities/Mirrors, and these fetches take up a
certain amount of bandwidth. If the relay is too slow, the bandwidth provided
by that relay does not compensate for the directory fetching bandwidth used to
tell people about the relay, and thus it is actively harming the network.
Additionally, since Tor processes are normally CPU-bound, most relays aren't
able to use all their available bandwidth with a single Tor process. Running a
relay on ARM (or likely any other mobile/low power) CPU will only further
limit how much traffic your relay is actually pushing.
Additionally, if you're attempting to do this with Orbot on an Android device,
you'll run into issues with Android's process management system and the Tor
process randomly dying unexpectedly. This means that you are providing an
unreliable, flapping relay which is actively messing up other people's
connections through the Tor network.
For the full thread where Mike Perry, myself, and other Tor developers are
discussing the details of how badly slow relays mess up the network, see [0].

Even better than disabling it, the Tor Browser Team really needs help from
