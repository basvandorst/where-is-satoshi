I've been gettings these messages as well. I have to solve a captcha
before my search will go through. As long as I keep the same search
window open, I don't see the message again.

Best compromise I've seen in this thread yet. I like it.

I'm pretty sure that the "keeping a connection open" issue which you
describe is due to AOL allowing people to be signed in from multiple
locations. I know that iChat.app did not allow for you to be signed on
in more than one place, so I'm guessing that you can disable the
multiple locations feature somehow (a quick search of the OSCAR
protocol turned up nothing however...). I would not attribute this
behaviour to malicious exit nodes.

One other way to deal with "antagonizers" is to make users pay money
to activate an account.
Something Awful
( is
one example of how this method is used to curb unwanted posting: when
somebody is banned, they have to pay to reactivate their account or
pay to create a new account. In this way users actions are directly
linked to their finances.

I looked at modifiying dproxy to do what you describe, it seems the
the modification could be as "simple" as replacing the call to
gethostbyname() with the dns lookup function from tor-resolve.
The code to dproxy is tiny, if somebody wants to take a crack at it,
please do. I just don't have the time right now.

Why not include a list of possible abuses with the Tor documentation?
The list could be organized on a per port basis, detailing what
complaints you might receive if a specific port is left open in the
exit policy.
For example:
Port 80 (HTTP)   Administrators running routers with port 80 open have
received abuse reports regarding Google Groups.

I just ran across: CGIProxy
A Proxy over CGI of sorts, similar to CECID (?). This looks like a
perfect front end for Tor.
It supports SSL and it looks like it can be easily configured to use a
proxy (Tor).
Has anybody tried this out?

I've seen the behavior that numE describes. However you do not need to
press ctrl-c to get a prompt back. I normally just hit the space bar
to get my prompt back.
