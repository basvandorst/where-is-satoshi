Hey guys,
It's Joe Kowalski. I saw this thread and saw that there was some concern about me, and I just wanted to let everyone know that I am fine. Nothing 'bad' happened to me. Taking down the site was intentional, and my reasons are varied and personal. Let me just say that I still support Tor and what Tor stands for, and will continue to do so, but probably in a more low-key way. I didn't mean to alarm anyone. If anyone wants or needs the latest version of the code that was running the site / DNS server, send an email to das32555 at yahoo.com (Temp address), and I'll send it to you. Thanks for caring!
Best regards,
Joe Kowalski

hi Kasimir,
do you know what's the difference between your v3.4.1 and my v3.2?
basically this is a good idea. I know how to install Joe's code together
with LAMP. But so far I didn't try to understand how Joe's scripts work
in detail. I would like to hear Joe's opinion about the idea of an
opensource project since it's his work we are talking about.
regards, Olaf
Hi guys,
You are free to do as you wish with the code, whether using it as is, using parts of it, modifying it, or organizing an opensource project around it to maintain.
Best regards,
Joe Kowalski
