Hash: SHA256
I'm developing a CMS platform called Airship and I'd like to make it
as Tor-friendly as possible.
Someone from the community suggested Two-Factor Authentication, but as
far as I'm aware there aren't many good options:
* SMS-based authentication requires a phone number, which is
identifying information
* Google Authenticator requires a Google Account, which now-a-days
requires surrendering your phone number to Google
* FIDO U2F requires users to purchase separate hardware devices which,
while cheap, aren't already in the arsenal of most netizens
I was curious if anyone in/around Tor was aware of any
privacy-preserving 2FA initiatives.
Thanks a lot,

?Since I sent my email ?
?I've been
?informed that Google Authenticator doesn't require ?a Google account. It
should be universal (RFC 4226 and/or 6238)
?If I encounter any difficulties, I'll revisit this thread (possibly with a
vendor-neutral implementation if it proves annoying enough).?

​We're already using PGP/GPG for password resets. (Account recovery is,
additionally, a feature users can opt out of entirely.)
However, PGP is a terrible choice for usability here.
I'm not trying to cater to the ultra-crypto-nerd crowd with this feature,
because they're unlikely to have weak passwords and therefore *need* 2FA.
