Publishing Is Dead. may seek to respond with the 'right way' to do it, the company you know will let me fall through the cracks, the trick you use to whitelie your way through the process.Don't bother.If there is a way through, and I'm not convinced there is, it is so difficult to find that a technically unsavvy user wo

What will be done about it? address specific points:# Bitcoin Mixing is promi
 sing, but infantile at this stage.Tor disables options like optimistic data initially because it reduces the anonymity set.I'd consider bitcoin, but having to link my bank account to get them in the first place?Or meet someone in person?A stronglynonanonymous link followed by a maybeanonymous link makes a weak chain.# VPS. Part of the exercise is also takedownresistance. The only affordable service I would consider takedownresistant today is Tor Hidden Services.Other providers, dedicated hosts, may be takedownresistant  but they are not cheap.Their monthly cost was my yearly budget.AFAIK there is no Hidden Service hosting provider willing to host content rather than text.# tor2web.This is nice, and enables ordinary people to reach Hidden Services, but doesn't solve my problem of deploying a Hidden Service anonymously.I think it's an important question to ask: Are Tor Hidden Services trustworthy enough to run on a box in your own name?The level of exploitation necessary to ro
 ot a box is much higher than the level of exploitation required to trick a server (web server, SSL library, or application code) into revealing its IP address.At that point, the anonymity is dead.Perhaps APAF problem will solve that to the point where a Tor Hidden Service is safe enough.#
