@_subject: Tor Conflict with PGP Desktop? 
I've been running Tor 1.0.5 in server mode for several weeks under Windows XP. But after I installed PGP Desktop 9.0.2, my Tor server seems to be no longer functioning as a router, though I can still use Tor with Privoxy for web browsing. But also, since installing PGP Desktop, Tor seems to quit on its own after about half an hour or so.
Is there a known conflict between Tor and PGP Desktop? I believe that PGP Desktop also uses localhost for some purpose. Is there a known

Sorry, I mis-stated the version of Tor I am using. It's 0.1.0.15.

How is the anonymity provided by Tor any more subject to abuse than, say, the anonymity afforded by companies and institutions that offer WiFi hotspots? Or Internet cafes? Or public libraries?

Actually, I think the analogy to the anonymity afforded by open WiFi hotspots is a good one insofar as potential for abuse is concerned, as both have the potential to be abused in similar ways. Where they differ significantly is the public benefit they provide. Tor offers anonymity, while WiFi hotspots offer not only anonymity, but also Internet access itself. Another difference that may be ethically significant is that while Tor is operated as a free, non-profit public service, many WiFi hotspots, though free, are provided by commercial establishments motivated by profit as they seek to entice customers.
I think the analogy between Tor and WiFi hotspots is useful in that any argument that a person should not be allowed to run a Tor server because of the potential for abuse might also be made with similar force against a person or group of persons hosting an open WiFi hotspot.

I think your call to end discussion of this topic -- a discussion to which I don't think you have contributed -- is inappropriate. If you're not interested in this topic, why not simply ignore it?

@_subject: Stephen Soghoian on U.S. Gov't Attitudes Toward Tor 
University of Indiana graduate student Stephen Soghoian, against whom the U.S. Government considered filing criminal charges stemming from an airline boarding pass generator that he posted on-line, in the 28 November 2006 entry of his weblog,/ slight paranoia ,/ comments among other things, on the attitude of federal investigators toward the Tor project:
    The Feds (at least those that I met) fundamentally disagree with me
    on many subjects - the role that researchers, academics, and common
    citizens take in studying, criticizing and pointing out the flaws in
    our security systems. I have been laying the groundwork for some Tor
     related research at Indiana University (pending
    approval from the University Counsel) - in fact, two of Tor's
    designers are visiting researchers at IU this year. It was made
    perfectly clear during the meeting that parts of the US government,
    at least the two represented at the meeting, strongly disapprove of
    Tor - and in particular, thought that research universities such as
    IU, MIT, Georgia Tech, Harvard and others
     have no business supporting such projects.

@_subject: Tor Server on Live CD? 
Considering the recent Tor server seizures in Germany, might it be desirable, from a privacy standpoint, to introduce a Tor "Live CD" that could be used to boot a PC in Linux and run a Tor server without writing any data to disk?
