If there are issues with startpage, is there any reason not to use duckduckgo as default? I use their hidden service as my default search engine and have never had issues with them.

I can confirm the ddg hs unreliability, and frequently end up using their clearnet site as a fallback. Very odd that one is down and the other not, but I would imagine?this is related to issues scalability and operating a large public hidden service.

With the tor-browser-bundle, despite the [--help] option indicates that "All unrecognized arguments will be passed to the browser". However, when you launch [$ tor-browser-en --new-tab ], [$ tor-browser-en ] or even [$ tor-browser], you get the following error:
"Tor Browser is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Tor Browser process, or restart your Is there a way to get this functionality with the existing browser bundle, as this feature works fine on vanilla Firefox? If not what would be required to allow these requests to be forwarded to the underling firefox process, or are there security/anonymity implications involved and thus this feature is p.s. [$  ] is my way of indicating that you launch  in the shell of your preference with non-root permissions.

If these are the pirates you seek, I much prefer their hidden service, no captchas to be found:?
