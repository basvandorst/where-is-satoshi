A slowloris attack is able to run through the Tor network if target server is vulnerable. The attack is based on consuming sockets by being really slow and keeping sockets open. It wouldn't criple the tor However any sensible sys admin would be able to either block all tor exits orset up a proxy to remove the vulnerability.
So basing a slow loris attack of tor does have some potential but it is easy to defend against. (luckily) tor is not that usefull for attacking websites this way ;)

iirc in the Netherlands you're not responsible for illegal actions commited through your Wifi.
In fact if you're a household and illegal activities are made through your own internet by one of the household members the state has to prove wich member it was to prosecute. It is not possbile to just hold the account holder responsible.
I used to run a open wifi and the only thing I did, for my own sake, was block port 25. Otherwise virus infected computers would spam the world and I'd end up on a blacklist unable to send mail myself.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Errors in logfile, tor relay stuck @ 100% CPU 
my tor relay is suddenly experiencing issues. Even when there is no traffic the tor process consumes 100% CPU. The logfile is getting spammed with this message:
[warn] tor_addr_is_internal(): Bug: tor_addr_is_internal() called with a non-IP address of type 204
Anyone have an idea what the cause is ?
