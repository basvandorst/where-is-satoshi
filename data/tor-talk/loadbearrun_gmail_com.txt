- From what I have read, it is at least theoretically possible for someone
running a Tor exit node to monitor any plaintext, non-SSL/https
connections that are passed through that node. The solution that seems
to be usually suggested is to always use end-to-end encryption, such as
https. However, some sites do not support https.
I have also noticed that there exist some free VPN services which can be
used reasonably anonymously, such as ItsHidden. Thus, I was wondering -
is there an easy way to, for lack of a better description, chain
proxies, so that the traffic between myself and the VPN is anonymized
through Tor, and my traffic between Tor and the internet is encrypted
through the VPN?

I am aware of that limitation. However, I am currently less concerned
about eavesdroppers between a given VPN and the destination than I am
about Tor exit-node eavesdroppers. Knowing the limitations involved, do
you know of some method to accomplish my expressed goal?
