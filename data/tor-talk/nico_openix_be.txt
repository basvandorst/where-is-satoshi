Additionally (my 2 cents)
People tend to mixup various things, when looking for 100% anonymity there
is much more that needs to be done then downloading the bundle.
It's a change of lifestyle especially if you have very high requirements
about a 100% solution.  Tor is a part in this, but for sure not the only
thing that needs consideration.
As Mick mentioned, a proper analysis requires full information regarding
the threat model.
Willing to elaborate further on this.
