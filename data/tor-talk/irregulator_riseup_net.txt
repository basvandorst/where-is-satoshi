@_subject: [tor-talk] anyone created an acct on GMX using Tor? 
To the posts mentioning Riseup :
This thread has get offtopic, on purpose or not.I'm not member of Riseup
Collective, but a devoted supporter of what these people do. That's why
i felt the need to answer some previous emails to this list.
 says :
"The Riseup Collective is an autonomous body based in Seattle with
collective members world wide. Our purpose is to aid in the creation of
a free society, a world with freedom from want and freedom of
expression, a world without oppression or hierarchy, where power is
shared equally. We do this by providing communication and computer
resources to allies engaged in struggles against capitalism and other
forms of oppression."
People talking about tickets, quotas, company etc, you should probable
have checked the about-us of Riseup Collective. Especially those who
have already created an account. That conversation was getting a bit
silly, no offence.
Riseup is a collective of people, not another corporate business. And we
prefer the way it is. We don't seek for a "cool" gmail's alike
web-interface or some GB storage space. That's not Riseup. And hopefully
won't be.
Everything in life is about trust, on the Internet that applies too.
I trust Riseup and share their vision about a better world. You people,
who seek yet for another "free alternative mail provider" to "do the
job", you'd better consider some other solution than Riseup.
Autonomous radical tech collectives and projects are something very
important to people fighting around the world
( Please don't abuse it.
Greetings and no offence

@_subject: [tor-talk] VPS provider 
Hey people
I was under the impression that everyone having physical access to a
running machine can get access to the operating system as well.
Encryption makes no difference for a running computer, since cold boot
attack may be used to dump the keys from memory. What's more, in a
virtualization environment i guess that would be easier.
If the above statements are generally correct, then you should trust a
VPS provider, as long as you trust the administrator of the host machine
*and* everyone else having physical access to it (for example the

@_subject: [tor-talk] Newbie question regarding exit policy 
Since, you've set "ExitPolicy reject *:*" to torrc then you won't be an
exit relay.
You can also search in  or
 for your relay, and see the flags, exit policy etc.
tor-arm is a nice monitoring tool for tor relays too.

So since Vidalia is removed, there is no easy way for the average user
to run a relay? Or you will still distribute packages with Vidalia for
this exact reason?
I tried linux64 version and works well.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Court in Greece acquits Tor exit node operator, 
came to court in Athens, Greece. All started back in February 2011, when
United States authorities contacted Greek authorities about a website
serving child porn material. US authorities provided a document with IP
addresses belonging to Greek ISPs and also a sample of the child porn
material. Among these IP addresses there was one in the range controlled
by the National Technical University of Athens, an address belonging to
a certain room in the university's dormitories.
The student who was at the time living in that room, was accused for
logging in the child porn website. District attorney did not order any
confiscation of the student's PC for further investigation on the disc.
The case was based solely on the IP address that the US authorities had
logged and provided to greek authorities.
The point is that at the time and date, the computer of the defendant
seemed to have made a connection to the website, was in fact a Tor Exit
Node. This was easily proven by feeding ExoneraTor [1] with the IP
address of the defendant and time/date of the crime. A simple query
returned the descriptors of the relay at the time and it's exit policy
was the reduced exit policy letting out traffic to ports 80 and 443, i.e
web traffic.
So the main defense line of the defendant was that he would never access
such material for ethical reasons, that at the time of the crime he was
running a Tor Exit node and he had no relation whatsoever with the
accusations. The relevant evidence was provided to the court -
screenshots from ExoneraTor and a statement by the Tor Project that
validated what the ExoneraTor was showing.
During the judicial procedure, a police officer of Cyber Crime unit of
Hellenic Police, was called to testify. The policeman, talked generally
about what's happening with child porn cases and how the unit
investigates them. He acknowledged the fact that the defendant was
running a Tor Exit node and he stated that there was no evidence the
defendant had commited the crime.
Next, the defendant talked about the ethical reasons he would never
visit such a site. He then explained why he was supporting the right to
anonymity and privacy, why he supported the Tor project and how he had
decided to run an Exit node. He exlained to the court the meaning of
being an Exit node, and that he could not identify whoever visited that
The court acquitted the defendant.
[1] : Editor comment : I have no official involvement in that case. I just
developed interest in it since I am a student in National Technical
University of Athens and also a Tor lover. I find this is a pretty
important legal decision about Tor relay operators in Greece. We
certainly need and can have more exit nodes in Greece.

here's another version. I removed the accents from the strings which are
showed capitalized, earning a little space. The translation of "user /

it fits now.

If you visit compass.torproject.org [1], you group relays by country and
you input "-1" to display all the results, you can get a nice list of
countries hosting relays with bigger percentage weigths in the consensus.
My understanding is that choosing a country outside the top10 or top15
would be a good location in terms of decentralizing the network. Of
course these countries may have more expensive hosting solutions.
