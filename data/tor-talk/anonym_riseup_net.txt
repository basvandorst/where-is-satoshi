@_subject: [tor-talk] heartbleed: ETA for tor release(s) that blacklist 
As the release manager for the Tails 1.0 release I'm also interested in
an ETA for this. Ideally the Tails image intended for the 1.0 release
will be built on 2014-04-27 (so this is when we'll truly freeze the
version of Tor), and released two days later. We Tails developers would
find it sad if its core piece of software becomes out-dated immediately
or even just shortly after that.
Nick (or any one else in the loop), do you have any idea of timings for
the next stable Tor release?

Thanks for letting us know!
Given the planned release date for Tails 1.0, this actually doesn't look
too bad a compromise. I had a quick look at the other tickets tagged
`024-backport` and nothing seemed very important. However, before
deciding on this, I'd really appreciate a confirmation from any of you
Tor devs that, as it looks now, the next 0.2.4 release will have no
other important security fixes affecting *Linux* *clients*. So, will it?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Upcoming stable release: 0.2.4.22. Please test? 
Unless there's a lot of unexpected problems, am I right to assume that
there's a good probability for 0.2.4.22 to be released before 8th of
June (the day the final image for Tails 1.1 is planned to be built)?
What's your hunch? I'm not asking for any promises, of course. :)

Ah, I didn't interpret the '?' as wildcard, so I thought it was an
outdated ETA. :)
I'm already running it and, as usual, it looks good.

I built a Debian package from these Tor 0.2.5.11 sources (with the
Debian packaging for 0.2.5.10 added), and then built a Tails image with
it, and ran our full automated test suite, which of course involves a
lot of Tor usage. I'm happy to say that no regressions were found so it
looks like a solid release, as usual. Good job!

Perhaps I'm overlooking the purpose of this option, but it doesn't look
like something you can rely on to get stream isolation between separate
torsocks invocations. For instance, on a POSIX-compliant system a PID
can be reused as soon as the process using it has terminated. This
implies that, for any purpose, a PID should only be used as a unique
identifier for the duration of the process using it.
Assuming the purpose is to provide stream isolation between torsocks
invocations, why not generate a big random numbers for the socks auth
user/password instead? 256 bits should be enough even when taking the
birthday paradox into account.
In practice PID resuage perhaps isn't a problem for any realistic use
case, making my remarks into theoretical nitpicking, but YMMV.

No code changes are needed. While it seems that the Instantbird logging
options has been removed from the preferences GUI (normally it's in the
Privacy tab) in Tor Messenger, they can be enabled via the
purple.logging.log_* prefs. After a restart, the logs will appear in
Messenger/TorMessenger/Data/Browser/profile.default/logs. I guess it's
ok to set purple.logging.log_chats = true as long as you only do public
chats (e.g. most IRC networks). [That is until you join a super sekrit
XMPP chat and have forgotten about that logging. Let's shoot ourselves
in our feet, yay! :)]

Patrick Schleizer:
I believe all you need is:
    pref("network.proxy.type", 0);
and possibly disabling Torbutton (which is a good idea any way since it will only add confusion in that setup).
IIRC all you need is to disable Private Browsing mode:
    pref("browser.privatebrowsing.autostart", false);
That has several other consequences, but at least some has individual prefs for toggling back to what the Private Browser mode does (I wouldn't be surprised if Tor Browser already change many of these prefs like that).
In addition to disabling Private Browsing mode you just have to enable the feature:
    pref("signon.rememberSignons", true);
YMMV for the above prefs and their exact behavior, but I want to make a point that all you ask for can be achieved by setting a few prefs, so it's only a matter of providing a profile with the necessary different defaults. I don't think introducing more environment variables, like you suggest in [2], is an improvement over this.
For the record, providing a different "clearnet" profile for Tor Browser is how we implement Tails' Unsafe Browser.

@_subject: [tor-talk] No more logs on 0.3.1 
This is expected if your run tor >= 0.3: in the Debian packaging the default logging was switched to using syslog, so on a default systemd-enabled Debian Jessie system you should look in the journal, e.g.:
    sudo journalctl -u tor at default.service

@_subject: [tor-talk] Help us build Tails 3.2~alpha1 build reproducibly 
Hash: SHA512
Dear Tails and Tor contributors,
dear Reproducible Builds community,
We have sent out a first call [1] for testing to build Tails 3.1 reproducibly
and we have received some build reports. Thank you very much for your help! We
have since then tried to fix most of the identified issues [2] in Tails
3.2~alpha1, and thus we'd kindly like to ask you to try to build the new ISO
image again, or even for the first time. Please don't hesitate to contact us
if you get stuck at some point in the process, for example by connecting to our
chatroom [3]! You can also send us email to tails-dev at boum.org (public) or
tails at boum.org (private).
Note that Tails 3.2~alpha1 is *not* recommended for real usage, since it has
not gone through *any* QA. Please use Tails 3.1 instead until Tails 3.2 is
# How?
For your convenience all instructions needed to attempt to reproduce
Tails 3.2~alpha1 are included hereafter. However all commands are
adapted for Debian Stretch (and Buster/Sid), so your results may vary if
you run another Linux distribution. Our full build instructions [4]
might help if you are having problems.
 Setup the build environment
Building Tails requires the KVM virtual machine hypervisor to be
available, a minimum of 1 GiB of free RAM and a maximum of 20 GB of
free storage.
 Install dependencies
    sudo apt-get install \
        git \
        rake \
        libvirt-daemon-system \
        dnsmasq-base \
        ebtables \

        qemu-utils \
        vagrant \
        vagrant-libvirt \
        vmdebootstrap && \
    sudo systemctl restart libvirtd
 If building as a non-root user
(Skip this section if you intend to build Tails as the root user!)
Make sure that the user that is supposed to initiate the build is part
of the relevant groups:
    for group in kvm libvirt libvirt-qemu; do sudo adduser $user $group; done
Then run `newgrp` (or just reboot) to apply the new group memberships
to the session.
 Build Tails 3.2~alpha1
    git clone     cd tails
    git checkout 3.2~alpha1
    git submodule update --init
    rake build
# Send us feedback!
No matter how your build attempt turned out we are interested in you
sending us feedback. For that we'll first need some information of the
system you used -- please run these commands in the exact same
terminal session that you ran `rake build` in (e.g. run them right
after `rake build`)!
    sudo apt install apt-show-versions || :

 If the build failed.
Please open a ticket on our bug tracker [5] with "Category" set to

 If the build succeeded ...
Please compute the SHA-512 checksum of the resulting ISO image:
    sha512sum tails-amd64-3.2~alpha1.iso
and compare it to:

It was reported to us that the above command pulls in ~3500 dependencies (~3.5 GB packages, 14 GB disk usage) on a minimal Debian Stretch, including a full GNOME desktop environment. Whoops! You will get 80% less dependencies (but still all the needed ones!) with this command:

Hi (yet) again,
It turns out there's a serious problem with Tails 3.2~alpha1 so it actually depends on *when* you build it -- the longer you wait, the more it will diverge from the "canonical" 3.2 that was built yesterday (in short: I forgot to freeze which APT repo snapshot to use when building, so Debian package upgrades will be installed during the build as they become available). We are terribly sorry about this if it wasted your time! :/
Please try to build 3.2~alpha2 instead! Below you find the adjusted instructions (the fixes of the two other "erratas" I sent earlier today are applied already):
