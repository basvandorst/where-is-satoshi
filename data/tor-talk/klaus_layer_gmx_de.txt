I am looking for updated debian sqeeze packages. Currently only Tor 0.2.1.26 packages seems to be available. Any ideas where to find the 0.2.1.28 packages?

Lee  wrote on 20.12.2011:
For me it is quite clear that by setting up a tor relay I highly expose the server and make it target for scanning and more. Therefore I am personally  happy with scanning my servers by tor friendly people. I don't regard this an attack but as a helpful service to the community of tor relay operators.
I would not go so far to publish vulnerabilities of a tor server on the internet but the server could be considered as vulnerable. As a result tor authority server could withdraw guard/exit flags or isolated the vulnerable server so that it do no longer get traffic. I think it is legitimate to make sure that the tor network is not endangered by vulnerable servers.

although all my Tor nodes are running 0.2.1.29, I just received emails from Tor Weather that they are out of date. I checked the download page and with apt-get if there a new version available, but I found nothing. Why does Tor Weather reports out of date ?

@_subject: Tor relay on vserver exeeding numtcpsock 
Hi all,
after running 2 tor relays over dialup connections for several weeks, I recently ordered a vserver (Hosteurope Virtual Server Linux L 4.0) and setup a middleman tor relay. Very fast the vserver run into shortage of tcp sockets which indicate lots of
"Error creating network socket: No buffer space available"
errors. The numtcpsocks parameter limit is set to 550 on the vserver. Before asking the ISP to increase the value I would like to ask you what a reasonable value  of this parameter would be. The tor wiki describe several parameters and values for SWSoft's Virtuozzo here but for numtcpsock a recommendation is missing.
Thanks for your help.

Thanks for all your suggestions. This morning I contacted the HostEurope support. They were very friendly but refused to increase the parameter. They told me that the product is designed this way and they cannot change anything. They advised me to order a product with a higher number of tcp sockets. But even the high-end vserver product for EUR 70 ($90) per month only provides 1550 tcp connections ( All these HostEurope vserver products are crippled regarding numtcpsock.
Bottom line: HostEuropes vserver cannot be recommended for tor relays. I will update the wiki accordingly.
I will move to another ISP. In the meantime I will play around with the ConstrainedSocksSize parameter to get the most out of the vserver.
Moritz, from which ISP did you get this $20 vserver?

Do you really think, that there is a one Sam who makes clear decisions regarding TOR? There is a very large organization (the US) consisting of many different people with many different opinions. Some of them don't like TOR, some thought it is an exiting research project and funded it, and others just don't care about it.

No. Tor uses geoip database to map ip-addresses to the origin country. This can be used by the tor operator, to get a statistic from which country clients are connecting. But the operator cannot see traffic. This is a screen shot of it:

------------- original message -----------
Dear Tor Relay Administrator,
my name is [...removed....], I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [... removed...] and I am currently doing a research study on the security of the Tor Network in collaboration with [...removed], head of the [..... You are receiving this message because your e-mail address is associated to the Tor Relay(s) with nickname(s) and address(es):
[.....list of relays removed...........]
It has recently been discovered a new DoS attack that could allow an adversary to stop one or more Tor Relays from participating and providing service to the Tor Network. This kind of attack poses a potential threat to the hundreds of thousands of users around the globe that use Tor every day. For instance, an adversary may be able to shut down a substantial part of the Tor Network, forcing users to surf the web in a traceable way. In an even worse scenario, an adversary may attract a big part of the data flowing through the Tor Network to one or more malicious Tor Relays that could, thus, cooperate in deanonymizing Tor traffic without being noticed by the users.
The aim of our study is that of evaluating the amount of resources an adversary would need to perform such an attack and what would be the actual damage that the Tor Network would suffer. At the same time, we are working on a patch to be applied to the Tor software that could mitigate this issue.
The reason you are receiving this message is that, to improve our study, we require some extra information about the Relay(s) you are running that, unfortunately, is not publicly available. We would therefore like to ask a very little, but precious, help from your side in collecting this information and sharing it with us. Note that the information we need is not related in any way with the traffic that you are relaying in this moment or have relayed in the past, thus it cannot be directly used to affect the privacy of the Tor users. What we are interested in is related to the hardware characteristics (e.g., number of physical CPUs, amount of memory) and with some of the configuration parameters of your Tor Relay (e.g., number of processors the Tor Relay can use, bandwidth limit).
In the case you agree to help us, collecting this information won't steal much of your precious time. In order to make it easier for you to get it, you will find on the website linked at the end of this message a small shell script that you can run on the Tor Relay(s) themselves or, if possible, on another machine with the same hardware specs. The script doesn't need any special (i.e., root) permission to run, it won't download anything from the network, nor it will install any software on your machine. We also commented it so as to make it easier for you to understand it in case you wanted to check what is the exact sequence of operations it will perform and information it will collect. Any data saved by the shell script will be available in a human readable text format stored in an output directory you will specify. We encourage you to use the public key you will find on the bottom of this message to encrypt the data collected by the script before sending it to us. You ca
 n get the same public key on the website linked at the end of this message. We would like to assure you that we will take extraordinary care in protecting in the best way we can the privacy of any information you will decide to share with us. We want also to assure you that, in the event it will be published, any data you will provide us will be carefully anonymized and given only in terms of aggregated statistics.
Together with the script, you will find a README file containing detailed instructions on how to use it and how to encrypt the results before sending them to us.
We thank you for your kind attention.
Best regards,
You can find the script and the public key in any of these locations:
