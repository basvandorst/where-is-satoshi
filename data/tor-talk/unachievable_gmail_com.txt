So am I supposed to upgrade? How dangerous is it to run an alpha? Is
there just a patch for 0.2.0.32?
Yes, I've read Using the default
caused that.

I am running tor-0.2.1.10-alpha bridge on my server. And again after a
certain period of time it does not appear on
 list(at first it did,
DirPort & ORPort are still reachable). I see _very_ little activity on
my 9030 port through `tcpdump port 9030`.
Is this normal?

To sum it up, I'd better run a Bridge if really wanna help Tor project?
I am somewhat afraid of government, I realise that's a kind of paranoia

You've read my thoughts! Thanks for your explanation. Really thought
that bridges are those servers in the middle, so it's clear now that
they are not.

@_subject: command line control software 
Is there any command line control software? Excuse me for that question.
Just read control-spec.txt and found it very easy to talk to Tor server
via telnet. But it would be rather convenient to use some tuned tool.
Will not be much disappointed if it does not exist, that's not any bad.
Not happy with graphical interface(though I use thunderbird and
firefox), it would be much more useful to run just a text tool, which
output will be grepable, fmtable, sedable and so on.

getting the message in the log which says the usual thing:
