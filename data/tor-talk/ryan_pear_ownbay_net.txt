About Repbin:
Repbin is an encrypted pastebin for the command line that runs over Tor!
Repbin servers form a distributed network where nodes sync posts with
each other (like in Usenet or BBS/Fido systems). This makes Repbin
resilient and scalable. Repbin focuses on privacy (encrypted messages)
and anonymity (padding and repost chains). To limit spam and
denial-of-service attacks, Repbin uses the Hashcash proof-of-work
algorithm which is widely known from Bitcoin mining.
