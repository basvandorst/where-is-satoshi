I'm still inclined to believe any compromise was unrelated to Tor.  If
this was a Windows network, it is not unheard of for one machine to
infect the rest.  The infection could have started on any of the
machines over the 3 weeks (or even beforehand).  If it's a *nix
network... having one machine compromised is plausible (however
unlikely), but having an entire network compromise would suggest many
serious mistakes were made.  The fact that he reformatted suggests these
were Windows boxes (it makes little sense to reformat a *nix box unless
you've been rooted... and I can't imagine an entire *nix network being
rooted unless someone has REALLY screwed up).
I think if this conversation is to progress beyond "Tor got someone's
network hacked" <-> "No, it probably it didn't", we'll need some
specifics.  Perhaps this associate should join the tor-talk list?
Here's some specific information that would be relevant:
* OS (Specific version):
* Tor Version:
* Specific evidence that Tor Exit was compromised (what was it doing,
was there detected malware, what was the name of the malware, etc...):
* Specific evidence that other network machines were infected (with same
data as above... OS, running services, etc):
* Specific evidence that the Tor Exit was the source of the compromise:
I think until those facts are known, we're just spinning our wheels.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor in a world of IPv6: "Local Bridges" needed? 
Please forgive the length of this... I just wanted to outline the
problem/solution as I see it, in order to be as clear as possible.
One of the benefits of running a Tor relay is supposed to be "better
anonymity against some attacks[1]".  As such, I (and I assume others)
run a Tor relay from home on a separate machine that is up 24x7.  In an
internet dominated by IPv4 and NAT, it seems to hold true that a
downstream relay could not determine whether the traffic originated from
the relay or a separate client.  However, IPv6 will do away with NAT,
and it will be immediately evident that a machine other than the relay
is producing Tor traffic.
There are a few ways around this that I'm aware of, each with its own
1.  Setup the relay as a "transparent proxy" for the network.
2.  Use SSH to tunnel traffic to the relay.
3.  Configure the clients to use the relay as a "bridge".
4. ???
 suffers from the fact that all traffic is unencrypted in the local
network.  Perhaps not a huge deal, but Google and Yahoo also recently
learned of the dangers of assuming "private networks" are private.
 suffers from being difficult for some (many?) users to set up, and
the fact that the relay still receives the data unencrypted.  The relay
by necessity has at least one publicly accessible service (Tor daemon),
so it has a larger attack surface.  If one were to successfully mount an
attack against the relay, they'd be able to receive all the local
Tor-bound data in plaintext.
 protects all data headed to and through the relay... but unless I'm
misunderstanding what was said in a previous tor-talk message ("a bridge
will be used as the first of three hops[2]"), your total external hops
is reduced to 2.  In that same tor-talk message, there is a link to
Proposal 188-bridge-guards [3].  I don't know if this was ever
implemented, but it seems like this would stretch the number of external
hops back out to three, essentially?
Any thoughts here?  Is it safe to use a local (public) relay as a
"bridge"?  Has Proposal 188 been implemented?  If so, does the relay
need to actually be configured as a bridge in order to perform this
"loose routing"?  Or would the concept of "local bridge" need to be

Blutmagie isn't "real-time".  A better resource for checking your status

hourly census for a given relay, and tends to update approximately 30
minutes past the hour.
Also, the bandwidth shown is not the actual bandwidth, but a weighted
number that represents how well your relay delivers bandwidth in
comparison to other relays with similar claimed bandwidths.  Since it is
a new relay, the bandwidth has probably not been measured by the
"bandwidth authorities".  See this for more info:
This is normal.  It takes time before clients see your relay listed in
the consensus, and until your bandwidth has been measured your relay
will have a very low probability of being chosen for circuits.
It's not the issue -- it's just saying you have an old version of

It looks like you grossly misunderstand how Tor works.  The only node
that can see your browser "fingerprint" is the exit node.  The problem
that Entry Guards are meant to solve is laid out in the very first
paragraph of the FAQ you linked:
In other words, if I can observe the pattern of traffic coming from your
IP address at a particular time, and simultaneously observe that pattern
at an exit node or website, then I can assume the traffic at the exit
belongs to you.  It doesn't matter that there are multiple layers of
encryption along the way -- the attack doesn't look at the contents of the traffic, just the volume and timing of it.  Having Entry Guards
helps, but does not completely solve this problem.
In regards to being "noticed once" -- if the site you are visiting is
being watched by your government, then being noticed just once may be
cause for them to watch you more closely.  If you're posting data to
wikileaks, having your government notice this could constitute a "very
bad thing".  That is just one example.

Whether that is the assumption or not is a matter of your personal level

If by "avg users", you mean "average people", I would suppose it isn't a
huge concern... but I don't know enough about Tor's "average user" to be
able to comment further.  It seems like it would be a failure of the Tor
project if anyone could confidently assert what is an "average Tor
user", as it would imply that someone can tell that 1000 unique Tor
users visit wikipedia in a day, vs 5 who visit very frequently.
That being said -- I believe (and I could be wrong) that Tor's target
audience is really those living in repressive regimes and subject to
censorship, and of course the whistle blowers too.  "Once is enough"
definitely applies to those people.  The rest of "us" just get first
rate privacy, and our traffic helps obfuscate the traffic of the people
who *need* anonymity.
Probably not :) ...  But don't underestimate the power of larger
businesses (financial, recording/movie industry, oil), and their ability
to get what they want from governments.
Fair enough.  I just said that because of the solution you provided --
changing fingerprints midstream.  It suggested that you thought each
relay could view your traffic directly, and that you didn't understand
that your traffic is wrapped in layers of encryption that are "peeled"
one-by-one as you reach each successive relay.  Since these layers of
encryption are a fundamental piece of how Tor works (and why it's called
"The Onion Router"), failing to understand that would be a "gross
misunderstanding" in my book :)  No offense intended, I assure you.

@_author: Michael Wolf 
@_subject: [tor-talk] TAILS uses one DNS server from OpenDNS **WARNING ** 
But, unless something has changed, Tor doesn't use the local client's
DNS resolvers, the exit node uses its own resolvers:
"Section 6.2 of the tor-spec.txt[5] outlines the method for connecting
to a specific host by name. Specifically, the Tor client creates a
RELAY_BEGIN cell that includes the DNS host name. This is transported
to the edge of a given circuit. The exit node at the end of the circuit
does all of the heavy lifting, it performs the name resolution directly
with the exit node's system resolver.
If all goes well, the exit node will respond with a RELAY_CONNECTED
cell. If successful the payload of this cell will include the IPv4
address for the host name. In theory, it may include an IPv6 address."
Once upon a time, Tails used ttdnsd for resolving DNS, which would have
used ttdnsd's resolvers.  This changed as of Tails 0.13
That last document explains that ttdnsd is still installed, configured,
and running, but it is not part of the 'normal DNS resolution loop'.  It
also mentions why OpenDNS was chosen (Google's DNS server started
blocking connections from Tor).
If it is actually possible for an anonymous user to set up an OpenDNS
account on behalf of an exit relay, the warning here should be that exit
relays should never use OpenDNS (unless they preemptively set up an
account).  Except in rare cases, the client's settings do not matter.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Thoughts on Tor-based social networking? 
While I can appreciate Bill's concerns (my web servers are regularly
attacked by miscreants using Tor), I have a hard time imagining any case
where an *effective* reputation-type system doesn't seriously impair
anonymity.  Any sort of "reputation" is basically a profile of the
user... which sites he/she has visited, who has left positive/negative
feedback, etc.  My understanding is that Tor changes circuits every 10
minutes to help prevent users being profiled -- why would we undermine
this with a reputation system?
In order for a reputation to be effective, it has to be long-term.  In
order to achieve anonymity, each "identity" has to be short-term.  These
goals are at odds with each other.  Even Nymble seems to have chosen a
24-hr cycle of "forgiveness".  In my eyes, this is too short to be
effective, and still too long for people who wish not to be profiled.
Finally, to get anyone to use this reputation system, there would have
to be some benefit to the user.  The benefit might be 1) being able to
edit wikipedia pages pseudonymously 2) being able to post on wide
variety of blogs/etc that currently block anonymous users 3) something
else.  So far the suggestion only seems to be to the benefit of the exit
node operator, to the detriment of the user's anonymity. Exit node
operators are not in a position to grant  and  so I don't know what
benefit they could offer that would be worth what the user would be
giving up.
For what it's worth -- I do like the idea of a pseudonymous social
network for people who wish to participate.  But in my mind it would be

In general, running an exit node from your home Internet connection is
not recommended, unless you are prepared for increased attention to your
home. In the USA, there have been no equipment seizures due to Tor
exits, but there have been phone calls and visits. In other countries,
people have had all their home computing equipment seized for running an
exit from their home internet connection. So you will need to find a
good colo and save your home connection for bridge or middle node use.
Plus, bandwidth will be much cheaper in a colo center anyway."
It's not recommended to run an exit node from your home, if that's what
you've done.  You could still run a relay node (no exit), without
encountering such issues.  I (and I'm sure many others) hope you will

@_subject: [tor-talk] Regarding FAQ: "Do I get better anonymity if I run a 
From the Tor FAQ:
I'm wondering if this is actually the case.  First, your client will
connect to an Entry Guard.  From the Guard's perspective, isn't it
almost guaranteed that if he sees a connection, it is from a client and
not traffic that has been relayed?  Further, if your own relay does not
have the Guard flag, isn't that 100% confirmation that the traffic
originated from your client?  I'm not sure if there is a special case
concerning hidden services, where it is possible an Entry Guard might be
chosen as perhaps the 3rd hop.
On the other hand, as a relay without either the Guard or Exit flags, an
Exit will always know that the traffic it receives from you has been
relayed.  The only case where it seems like you *might* get better
anonymity is if your relay is one of the ~25% of relays with the Guard
flag.  I speculate that few of these relays are located in people's
homes, so to gain this boost in anonymity one would have to configure
their own relay to be their Entry Guard. (?)
Next, in the Tor manual regarding FastFirstHopPK:
first hop of creating circuits.
if it?s operating as a relay, and it will never use the public key   >
step if it doesn?t yet know the onion key of the first hop. (Default: > 1)"
This seems to indicate that, by default, clients behave differently than
relays.  I may be mistaken (and I can't find a source for this), but I
thought it was not recommended to use the same instance of Tor for both
your relay and your client. (?)  In either case, if you have a separate
client, wouldn't you have to disable FastFirstHopPK in order to blend in
with your relay?
I appreciate any insights given regarding the above.

  For example, running a relay increases both the node diversity and the
total bandwidth of the network, which encourages more users to use Tor.
 The more Tor users, the lower the probability that any given traffic at
an exit node belongs to you.  This could be listed as an indirect benefit.
  One might also suggest that increasing network bandwidth improves user
experience -- and happy Tor users are more likely to add relays to the
network or suggest Tor to a friend, who might setup a relay.  As before,
increased node diversity and traffic improve anonymity for everyone.
  There could still be mention that running an Entry Guard can give you
even more anonymity -- I just think it needs clarified more that simply
running a (middle) relay does not mean the next node can't tell if the
traffic belongs to you or not.  (That is, assuming the points in my

Tor exit nodes have to be completely blind for legal reasons.  The
moment they start inspecting or filtering out *any* type of content,
some government can pressure the Tor Project to filter out other
content.  I don't remember the specific legal terms, but inspecting or
filtering the data changes your status from being a simple network relay
to being a sort of content provider, and you can be held legally
responsible for any content that flows through your node at that point.
Jitter/timing could be done, since that would not require any inspection
or filtering.  However, IIRC, the amount of additional latency required
to make timing attacks non-trivial is far more than would be acceptable
to the typical user.  Someone who has studied this could give more insight.

then your exit node changes after so many minutes... but the new exit
node could be overloaded so it drops half of the requests coming
through, or the exit node is banned (HTTP 403) on the site being
requested, or the exit node is misbehaving and modifying traffic, or...
At this time, using Vidalia is the only way to change exit nodes without
losing all your tabs, or to see which exit node is misbehaving.  It
would be really useful to be able to change exit nodes without Vidalia,
even if this function is hidden somewhat.

You can use the ExcludeExitNodes directive if you want to avoid exits in
certain countries.  I would assume that using exit nodes in your own
country/close partners is generally a bad idea if your government is
your adversary.  It seems like this would be the easiest case for them
to do traffic correlation.  On other hand, nothing stops them from
running exit nodes in other countries, so simply avoiding exits in your
own country/partner countries may not be very effective at all.
You know what might be a cool idea (but probably a large undertaking,
*  On first boot, TBB questions you about your goals/adversary model.
* TBB configures torrc appropriately to balance performance/privacy vs.
your specific adversary.  This could include requesting/selecting
bridges or excluding certain exit nodes, etc.
I know, Tor devs are busy already... It just seemed like a neat idea.
Someday I'll take the time to really learn C so I can do more for the
project beyond running a relay and spreading the good word.
