@_subject: [tor-talk] List of ways to attack Tor 
I'm tasked with doing a short report on the ways in which Tor can be I've brainstormed and done research for few hours and this is the list I've come up with.
Is there anything big that I've missed?
I feel I might be a bit light on more technical attacks.
Your help is greatly appreciated.
Realistic attacks against Tor:
-DDoS directory authorities, possibly knocking the entire network down after a time
-DDoS hidden service directories to keep a specific hidden service -DDoSing specific hidden services to keep them offline
-Hacking the directory authorities and spreading false network information, perhaps to direct more people to malicious relays
-Repeatedly requesting information about bridges until you've built a list of all of them
-Traffic sniffing and analysis at the exits relays, perhaps leading to discovery of personal identity information
-Traffic modification at the exit relays (e.g. JavaScript injection when a client visits a website using HTTP)
-Traffic analysis resulting in end-to-end correlation
-Traffic tagging resulting in end-to-end correlation (are there any ways to do this with current Tor?)
-Sniffing for hidden service addresses by becoming a hidden service directory and logging all the onion addresses you observe
-Inserting relays strategically so they become hidden service directories of a specific hidden service, then denying access to it
-Flooding the network with fake hidden services until the hidden service directories can no longer handle them all and run out of memory
-Tracking techniques (e.g. cookies, fingerprinting) being used for deanonymisation when the same browser is used for Tor and non-Tor -Tracking clients between exit relays via techniques such as -Application layer attacks
applications that aren't configured to use Tor (e.g. what I heard happened with the FBI pedo hacks or a trojan)
-Embedding yourself in the Tor community then advocating design decisions or inserting code that weakens Tor
-Same as above except for protocols and software that Tor relies upon such as encryption standards and libraries
-Taking advantage of existing weaknesses or back-doors in software that Tor replies upon (Heartbleed)
-Providing unofficial versions of Tor that contain back doors (as I assume is what is happening on mobile app stores, which are filled with unofficial Tor)
-Hacking the official Tor file servers to distribute back-doored versions of Tor
-Finding out what websites (and maybe hidden services) an improperly configured client is looking at by examining the DNS requests they make
-Breaking of encryption (in the theoretical situation that you have a computer powerful enough to do this, such as a quantum computer)
-Identifying Tor users and hacking them (isn't this what the FBI intends to do from now on?)
-Social engineering
it's not secure
of interest for the rest of eternity; you'll have NSA agents reading your email and CIA agents going through your trash
costs money? Use a VPN
dividing the community
that vulnerabilities will never be discovered and fixed
-Government or ISP blocking of Tor (e.g. the Great Firewall)
-Making use of Tor a crime
-Websites blocking Tor exit relays or crippling Tor users' ability to use the site
-Have law enforcement and copyright holders harass exit relay owners until they shut down

Thanks, those talks were very useful.
One question: Has the attack where the first hop refuses to extend circuits, except to other relays under their control still a problem?
Has it been addressed apart from using guards?
