@_subject: [tor-talk] Why Crimekit Atrax will attract attention 
I know that amplification attacks are not problems in the Tor network
(Enter one
bit comes out a bit). DDOS tools originated in the Tor network tend to clog
the output nodes. Correct ?

analyse the traffic over this ports with tcpdump. share with us. i'm
curious too. =]

interesting analysis, Sebastian.
The top 5 COUNTRIES WITH HIGHEST NUMBER OF INTERNET USERS in the tor
CHINA -
USA -
INDIA  -
JAPAN -
Brazil -
Russia -
USA and RUSSIA still growing. draws attention to the impact, or not, of
botnets in the first place ranking. china is one of the countries in the top
five of the victims of botnet. for what reason china has not felt this
the five countries represent 2:44% for all tor users

@_subject: [tor-talk] What if I connect to all nsa Tor nodes? 
in  say:
So, what should we do? Suppose the attacker controls, or can observe,
*C*relays. Suppose there are
*N* relays total. If you select new entry and exit relays each time you use
the network, the attacker will be able to correlate all traffic you send
with probability *(c/n)2*. But profiling is, for most users, as bad as
being traced all the time: they want to do something often without an
attacker noticing, and the attacker noticing once is as bad as the attacker
noticing more often. Thus, choosing many random entries and exits gives the
user no chance of escaping profiling by this kind of attacker.
Today there are:
N = +/- 4000  [1]
C = number of relay (relay over ISP, traffic **between Ases and IXPS factor
) observed from NSA - are there studies that indicate the amount of relay,
ixps, isp, compromised by nsa?

Voc? vai precisar do proxy tor e um navegador seguro, que pode ser feito o
download no site informado pelo amigo. A rede Tor ? uma rede que n?o segue
os padr?es de sua internet convencional, por isso voc? precisa de um proxy
para te levar at? a esta rede an?nima de arquitetura diferenciada.

Luther, shortly after posting this thread, this gentleman posted the
following thread: "GAROTAS MENORES PELAS". It is evident that the intention of
it is not in the list of the best here. He should be moderate. It is
evident that the intention of it is not good. He should be moderate.
* Luther, logo ap?s postar esta thread, este senhor postou a seguinte
thread: "GAROTAS MENORES PELAS". Fica evidente que o intuito dele n?o ? dos
melhores aqui na lista. Ele deve ser moderado.
