@_subject: [tor-talk] A curious email from Twitter mentioning Tor Project 
Indeed. When I received the email I assumed it was due to using Tor with
Twitter since that seemed to me to be the most likely reason. That, or
some detection algorithm used by TWitter was touchier than it should
have been, causing it to trigger when it shouldn't have.
After a couple of weeks (and finding no more than 46 confirmed "Persons
of Interest (by 'State Actors')", I'm at a loss as to why we received
it. Looking at the list members and our posts, nothing stands out as
being noteworthy.

@_subject: [tor-talk] staggeringly unhelpful 
To add another, I created my account in January 2011 and I've always
used Tor with it, including during the registration process.  Since its
creation I've never experienced any of the lockouts that I've seen
countless people complain about, but unlike you I do not have 2FA
A month before receiving the "State Sponsored Actor" notice I received a
notification that my "account may have been compromised by a website
or service not associated with Twitter", but I don't have that account
linked to any websites or services not associated with Twitter.
