I think you have the same problem as me. By looking at the graphs of
your node on torstatus.kgprog.com, I note that your Tor doesn't keep the
average around the maximum bandwidth specified.
The limit imposed by RelayBandwidthBurst should be reached only for
short periods of time. Your curves show that you are, most of the time,
over the RelayBandwidthRate limit.

I am testing the options RelayBandwidthRate and RelayBandwidthBurst. I
note, using the utility iftop that the band-width consumed by Tor (in
the absence of any client connection) largely exceeds the limits. Did
somebody observe the same behavior?

Hi phobos,
Did you leave the old options BandwidthRate and BandwidthBurst?
Personally I completely removed them. If I set them, it works like
before, if I remove them the bandwidth increases drastically.
For example :
with the options
BandwidthRate 50 KB
BandwidthBurst 60 KB  -> download rate  : ~50KB/s  upload Rate : ~50KB/s
With the following options only :
RelayBandwidthRate 50 KB
RelayBandwidthBurst 60 KB
I obtain download rate ~95KB/s upload rate : ~95KB which is pretty close
to the upload limit of my line.
I don't touch any more the configuration during a few times to see how
that evolves.
