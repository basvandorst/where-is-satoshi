Let me describe a two examples about users blocks banners in privoxy/polipo/adblock/etc:
1. Webhost can see that user block russian/german/chinese/etc big portal banners. Webservers owner can make a conjecture about specific language of the user.
2. One exit or colluding exit nodes can compare banners blocking profiles from time to time. Profiles can be linked from different seances.
Any comments?

@_subject: [tor-talk] =?utf-8?q?Users_profiling_through_person=D0=B0l_banner?= 
Too many users dislikes of annoying web elements -- banners, popups, scripts,
strange frames. They use a tools to blocks that elements or change webpage rendering.
Traditional programs for filtering is a local proxys -- privoxy or polipo are examples with close relation to Tor and used actively. This programs cannot filtering SSL-content and evil site
can use mix of SSL-ed and non-SSL-ed banners, pop-ups, etc to determine a fact
of using such proxy and trying to guess personal users filtering settings.
The problem may be even worse, with or without using this proxy, even if users block
contents within a browser itself (with Firefox plugins to block banners, and scripts). Not
only sites, but "mans in the middles", adversarial clusters of evil exit nodes
can does parsing traffic and modifying web contents by injecting banners, misconfigured
cookies, incorrect frames.
Injected traffic for various sites, in different times
and seances can be the way of revealing users with personal blocking rules. Data
about blocking profiles of that users may be statistical processed and correlated.
Is it a real threat? Should Tor users stop blocking contents
selectively? Or they can use predefined and shared rules in analogy of Torbutton?

apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade/install is another good example for hiddenly and privately downloading small Linux packages. secure-Apt uses gpg verification, then
adversary on the exit node cannot substitute or modify thats packages.
Good for hidden services especially for hiding system administrative activity.
apt-get runs trought root and proxy is only way to do it through tor.
Using privoxy 'forward socks4a / 127.0.0.1:9050 [proxy address]' in
privoxy conf (similar in polipo) user can hide the fact of using Tor
and use (and abuse) proxy servers in the chain after exit-nodes to using
tor-blocked resources, for example.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Getting of Tor Browser 
We talk about it day ago on some web-resource. Possible with you personally :-)
Linux provided system Tor-daemon seems more secure then tor started from user.
I propose next steps but concern about any "Gotcha!" here:
1) Download, check gnupg signatures and unpack tor-browser. Keep system Tor-daemon from deb-package  with carefully settings including your transparent firewalling.
2) Activate plug-ins (HTTPS-Everywhere, NoScipt, TorButton) with copying:
cp -r ../tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile/extensions/* ../tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/extensions
(or use symlinks).
3) Don't run Bundle start script, ignore vidalia and tor from bundle.
Run '../tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/firefox' directly. Check that plugins is working and you use system tor correctly without leaking information (Use Torstatus check sites, local sniffers).
4) Don't use vidalia. Use 'sudo killall -SIGHUP tor' instead of vidalia newnym control-port command. And restart your tor-browser after that newnym.
Any comments?

Linux version of TorBrowser just works simple like Windows too.
But "advanced" Linux users and distros developers needs a separate packages
for flexibility:
(see info about transparency torification for any traffic:
and some sort of security (using system provided tor-daemon starting from restricted
users, SeLinux integration).
We know that developers works in the direction of better integrating Tor for Linux
not only for "point-and-click" users:
Users comfortable with Linux-packaging system need a way to getting separate
TorBrowser as well, with
separated depended/recommended packages for neccecary plug-ins.

Everything works OK before
in Debian stable
Now I can't use Tor-browser directly that way described above:
start-tor-browser script from TBB itself works correct but using tor tunneling from system tor-daemon with Linux transparent firewalling torifycation double increased tor overhead.
Using Tor with users permissions instead of debian-tor daemon
 is not a best way for secure integration with a system too.
Is it version developed especially for enforcing use TBB as is?

Before this I just use full path without start-script and not bother about profiles.
This version not working without changing $HOME environment variable to `pwd` in start-script.
OK, I use relative path to start Tor-browser firefox from script and see clean profile.
What can I do to change it back?
I understandt that this is not a priority (or very low) for the project. And core developers has more important goals to make Tor better and  widespread this great software.
if it makes someone else, this will be good.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Trouble with 2.2.33-3 - Dirty workaround to avoid 
Dirty workaround recipe:
1. Leave your transparency torifying iptables-firewall rules as is.
2. Run start-tor-browser scripts.
3. Vidalia runs local tor.
4. Local tor slowly builds circuits throw torifying connections:
 double torifying, double circuits length, slow connection.
5. Vidalia starts TBB-FF.
6. kill -9 Vidalia, and user-tor (not system-tor!)
7. Change in the T-button random socks-port to your system tor-port:
select "Use custom proxy settings" "127.0.0.1" "9050"
Now you work through system-tor, started from /etc/init.d/tor, secured with low privilegy group debian-tor, integrated with SELinux, etc.
You can use 'sudo killall -SIGHUP tor' as newnym command or tune control ports.
If you make an error in any point (instead of first - firewalling) then your connection will not be working,
or will be slow because doubling overhead.
But none of thats mistakes cannot make plain traffic leakages.
May be developers just give TBB-Linux users non-default config options: "Use system Tor".
Please, don't enforce to use TBB with local Tor for advanced users!
Don't ruin a flexibility of transparency tor-firewalling and security of using /etc/init.d/tor !

1. Globally configured tor provided specially for Debian-Linux from  . Signigicant part of Tor-network servers works with it. Manually configured without Vidallia.
2. System tor can be started or stopped only by root user
(or starting/stopping with system itself),
than it drops rights to group "debian-tor" -- special restricted group without associated shell.
Local Tor haves rights similar to most weak part of network connected system - Browser itself.
Potentialy malicious code executing from the browser
with user rights for "user-local-tor" reveal your IP.
You can hide within virtual machine or behind a Tor-router or make multi-users separated profiles
(with separated X-servers running in parallel) and use system Tor and transparent anonimyzing. Only with users rights (non root) an adversary can't reveal your IP directly. 3. Global Tor may be configured with transparent firewalling to anonimyze any users traffic and
block any leakages. Not only from firefox, but for any user programm
 (leaving potentially identifying headers from that programm as is of course).
4. Global tor can be used with special restricted rules provided with SELinux or more broadly
rules provided for system daemons. In Linux system daemons more secure than user-running programms by design.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB as user debian-tor 
Mixing permissions from "local-browser-tor" from TBB and "global-system-debian-package-tor"
seems to be an unnecessary confusion.
It's still too broad permission: any user from localhost can connect to Xserver
In xhost command username can be specifyed. IMHO it's still a dangerous way.
Debian/Linux/(other Unix-like) has two choices now:
1. Officialy recommended: use TBB as is, starting from start-tor-browser.sh,
with Vidallia and "local-tor with-users-rights" -- from your own username.
2. Risky and complex if configured mistakenly: also use start-tor-browser.sh
but just to start TBB-FF (avoiding new restrictive measures), then kill -9
Vidallia and local Tor and use firewall to send your traffic to system-tor.
2-nd point is actual if you use different tor profiles, transparently anonimyzing
(with iptables + system tor), anonymizing routers, virtual machines, parallel running
separated X-sessions, global SELinux policies, etc.
I trying discuss it before: You can follow this tread and find working solution.
Use it at your own risk!
Will be better if TBB provide officialy options for using system Tor-daemon for Linux users.
Self-made measures is the best way to "shoot yourself in the foot", but very restrictive and rigide ways to use current TBB
 are "unix-unfriendly" overmuch.
I think some secure, officially adopted, broadly tested tradeoff between advanced and unexperienced using of Tor in Unix-like is needed.
First step may be an option (non-default) in some config to start T-Browser without  bundling it to local Tor and Vidallia. I hope that developers finds a way to give users a choice for experimenting
even though this choice is potentialy way to "shoot yourself in the foot".

If I run previous version of tor Linux-Debian packages and type 'ps aux | grep tor'

After upgrade that field displays only uid (106) but /etc/passwd for debian-tor is correct.
I use transparent firewalling for rerouting local traffic into Tor and use a name "debian-tor" as iptables option.
After that update this option is not working. I just replace "debian-tor" to "106" in iptables rules and
everything works again. I think some leakage of private information is possible, depends of personal firewall settings but not significant. Most of programms just not works with wrong username firewalling.

Run command for create tbb-group with password:
addgroup --system tbb-tor
Add this rules to your firewall:
 anonymous users;
DIRECT_OUT_GID="tbb-tor"  id for TBB
TOR_UID="debian-tor"  tor (if you use it)
 user runs programs with transparent torification to system tor
 you use it):
$IPTABLES -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner --uid-owner anonymoususer ! --gid-owner $DIRECT_OUT_GID -m tcp --syn  -j REDIRECT --to-ports 9040
$IPTABLES -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp -m owner --uid-owner anonymoususer ! --gid-owner $DIRECT_OUT_GID -m udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53

Run your tor-browser with sg from x-terminal emulator:
sg tbb-tor -c start-tor-browser.sh
Unfortunately, this is not an ideal solution for transparent torification TBB. All (but udp and dns-tcp) tcp trafic goes away. Using unix groups is not a way to separate start-script, vidalia, browser and TBB-tor itself. A more fine-tuned firewall solution is still desirable

An "application-level" firewall is an illusion of security. Procesess can be separated by owners
with users and groups but programs itself cannot be authenticated to iptables. That's a reason to exclude an "application-level" firewall options --owner --cmd-owner from the kernel iptables modules.
Stronger way to manage network connections associated to programs is SELinux security contexts or
similar security modules. Even a path based ACLs and MACs such as AppArmor can be avoided and failed and only strong security context isolation in SELinux is a right decision.
Or just simple use system groups with iptables: not so secure, not so strong.

And only "transparent mode" in T-button is used. Discontinuing separate Vidalia affect me some way.
Some of my TBB-profiles not pretend to be strong anonymous and consist and preserve minimum of installed bookmarks and tuned plugins. Another ones complete wiped before replaced.
Too simple "replace TBB in all homedirs" model complete broke my ways of using tor in Debian.

And what? Everyone can run your own tor node and see in the consensus: if sinister DA falsified that node key (and sign it!), then that node can proof that fact to everyone too.
And signed consenus data archive from all years tor stats can be downloaded from torproject.
Find one false key from this archive or from your cache of local tor-stats and proof node authentication forgery to everyone.
In the case of fully decentralised p2p-networks defining trust is more hard.
Without centralised stats analizing and authenticated broadcasting consensus to users,
evil goverment or ISP-like adversary can isolate your connections from "good" nodes and inject into your network connections
zillions virtually unexist (DPI-emulated) faked controlled bad
nodes with adversary predefined keys, and rerouting your or group of peoples
traffic to surveillance centres.
No need to steel any keys, just decrypt traffic predefined to you with faked nodes on the fly, so good?
If DA is down or compromised then temporally new DA can be started on new addresses and placed in users tor-configs, then new TBB version will include them.

May be that algo is relevant to independed control of consensus data:
Any Tor node or some active users can do it potentially.

On Wed, 30 Jan 2013 11:58:01 -0800
Yes: for any system servers (one Tor server, system-daemon).
No: for any client soft (Torbrowser without inner tor component - "disbundled" TBB).
You can add many users to your /home/user1, /home/user2, /home/userX, etc.
After upgrading with package manager /homedir settings of users
(programm configs for chat, accounts in mail-agents, etc) remains individual and different.
In my case any user (my anonymous profile)
has personal X-servers (running in parallel mode) to be fully isolated
from another and separated with firewall to individual circuits creation in system tor-daemon individual users ports.
Yes, system tor-daemon will be no more than one at the same time like apache.
And don't need to be to.
This works for any client software, but TBB is tightly bundled in not very friendly
unixish way and more restrictive and unconventional deb-packaging makes upgrades painful
for some slightly advanced using cases instead of any other Linux client soft.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Web of Trust, 
Using "Web of Trust" you sacrifice your anonimity, forward secrecy and deniability for the sake of privacy in the term of "security and integrity of a message context".
The graph of your contacts disclosured, timing information leaked for traffic analysis etc.
This is a cross purpose to the goals related to Tor ideology.
OTR and GPG (like Tor and any other similar tools) sometimes refer to intersected, sometimes to disjoint ranges of usage.

At first, the local interceptor can extracts private authentication key
from heartbleeded guard. Then emulate connection to IP of this guard (a
substituted faked MiTM-ed version of the Guard) for the targeted users.
Something like this can be done at the any parts of the Tor-network for
MiTMing and stripping connections between heartbleeded Tor-nodes for
extracting some parts of information about routed circuits.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Using Tor Browser without Tor? 
Yes you can. I use that way for transparent torifycation in Linux, manually restarting Browser and changing tor-circuits.
  1. Unpack TBB 3.5.X in separate dir.
  2. Delete tor-launcher:
  ~/TorBrowser/tor-browser_en-US/Data/Browser/profile.default/extensions/tor-launcher at ...
  3. Start Tor Browser, type about:config in address bar, enter.
  4. Ignore warning "This might void your warranty!",      press the button "I'll be carefull, I promise!"
  5. Enter in searchfield: torproject
  6. Replace fields:
     extensions.torbutton.test_url      extensions.torbutton.test_url_interactive      extensions.torbutton.versioncheck_url    to
     extensions.torbutton.test_url about:blank
     extensions.torbutton.test_url_interactive      extensions.torbutton.versioncheck_url about:blank
  Don't forget to check new versions manually!
  7. Go to Tor button (green onion icon). Select preferences, check on:      "Transparent Torifycation (Requires Custom Transproxy or Torrouter)"
    For using Tor Browser without tor you don't need any of this     transparent helping tools.
Hope that helps!
  I believe, developers stay hold this feature to make Tor Browser independent from inner tor
 and to easy making transparent torifycation into system Tor-router.
