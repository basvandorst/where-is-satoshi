@_subject: [tor-talk] Any free email service can work with Tor 
I used to subscribe a few mailing lists with mail.ru mailboxes.
Today they blocked all my email accounts which were only connected through Tor.
Is there any other free email service provider that can be used with Tor?
Of course, I had tried GMail, they did the same thing before I switched to
Mail.ru, and Mail.ru worked for a few years until today. I only sent
less than 10 emails per week from those Mail.ru accounts, most of the
time I just need them to receive mails from mailing lists.
Any help would be appreciated.
