Duncan, I think you're trashing a distro based on what happened in 17.3
from overseas. the smart thing is to checksum the download. There are a
few articles above that talk about this. and there are two sets that
verify the downloads now. So, in fairness, I believe Mint isn't any
different than Ubuntu or Debian. Don't forget Debian was vulned a while
back too. All of these come from the same place and some of these repos
are interchangeable. I think your subjective ideas are simply out of
date and wrong now. (P.S., there are more links to prove what I am
saying here)

With that logic, Debian still is too.

There are also some providers that use onion for transport on tor system
using Thunderbird and the Tor proxy, not birdy though.

When I start Arm, I get 'controller password.' I have followed
directions to hash the password from torrc to armrc, however, nothing
seems to work correctly. I still get the same results. Any ideas?

I am getting an error from the first line... cat ~/.tor/torrc returns no
such file. I tried different variation with the same result. My torrc is
at /etc/tor/torrc

Sorry to take so long to get back to you, I realized I needed my tor on
for my email. Anyway, this gave me errors too. As shown below:
