@_subject: [tor-talk] GSoC - Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit 
Hello everyone !
I'm Julien Voisin, a french GSoC student, and I'll be working on
the Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit (MAT) this summer.
I'm using free softwares on a daily basis,
and I'm glad I can contribute back !
My plan about the MAT is to deliver at
the end of this summer a nice application in
three parts :
- a GUI
- a CLI
- a library for accessing/modifying metadata
It should be able to :
- remove meta/anonymise a file
- removemeta/anonymise recursively a whole folder
- dealing with archives
- securely remove files
- let the user modify/customise meta
and of course, testable, extensible, and portable.
All of this using Python :)
I'm hanging around on  and,  with the nick "jvoisin".
I'll use a blog ( for keeping
you updated about my progress.
Have a nice day :)

the end of the GSoC is near, and I think I have almost achieved my
objectives (except for zip files, but I'm working on a patch). My project is
also meant to run well on Tails; dependencies are python-core and
python-parser; optionals dependencies are python-mutagen for more audio
format support, and python-poppler and python-cairo for pdf support.
I need some testing/usability comments of my project.

For the dependencies, yes, they are packaged
For the project : no, but you just have to do a "git clone"

@_subject: [tor-talk] [announce] MAT 0.1 is out 
Hello everyone !
The first release of MAT is here !
MAT stands for Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit, it was my 2011 GSoC project
for Tor.
It's a toolbox composed of a GUI application, a CLI application, and a
- What is a metadata ?
Metadata consist of information that characterizes data.
Metadata are used to provide documentation for data products.
In essence, metadata answer who, what, when, where, why, and how about
every facet of the data that are being documented.
- Why metadata can be a risk for your privacy ?
Metadata within a file can tell a lot about you.
Cameras record data about when a picture was taken and what camera was used.
Office documents like pdf or Office automatically adds author and company
information to documents and spreadsheets.
Maybe you don't want to disclose those information on the web.
For now, Mat only removes metadata from your files, it does not anonymise
their content,
nor can it handle watermarking, steganography, or any too custom metadata
- Supported formats so far:
    Portable Network Graphics (.png)
    JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg, ...)
    Open Documents (.odt, .odx, .ods, ...)
    Office OpenXml (.docx, .pptx, .xlsx, ...)
    Portable Document Fileformat (.pdf)
    Tape ARchives (.tar, .tar.bz2, .tar.gz, ...)
    Zip (.zip)
    MPEG AUdio (.mp3, .mp2, .mp1, ...)
    Ogg Vorbis (.ogg, ...)
    Free Lossless Audio Codec (.flac)
    Torrent (.torrent)
- Where does MAT lives ?
MAT is already packaged in Haven (
soon Tails (
and in debian (
Stables versions are here : * git repo : * official website : * old blog : mat-tor.blogspot.com

nop : it don't use OSX nor Windows,
so I really don't know how to make MAT running on those platforms,
sorry :/
Only a small TODO file.
But I want to implement "un-watermarking" measures.

Ugh, I don't think that a direct inclusion of a maintained lib
inside MAT is a good idea (At least for the packet distribution,
for a "portable tarball", it might be a good idea).

.doc, .odt, ... are _realy_ insane and ugly.
I wanted to include them during my GSoC, but I realized
it will take many weeks to handle them properly.
But it's on my TODO list.
