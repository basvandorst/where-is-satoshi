Its not all i7's, only the i7-980X (extreme series) about $1000.
Here's the benchmarks - see the AES256 results
Of course, the i5 also had this, but it is still slower.

Hi TagNaq,
Thanks for this.. you might be interested to know that co-incidentally I
had a nasty experience with one of these sites (don't know which now)
running this code some 4-6 months ago. I had to switch jscript on to
view the site and when I reloaded the page my pc slowed to a halt and
then after a minute of 2 re-booted all on it lonesome, taking a while to
come up after re-booting. At the time it was just annoying, as I had to
go back to there again and the same thing happened. On the 3rd time I
went to another Tor status site and the problem did not repeat.
I didn't think anything of it until about 3 weeks ago, when I got a new
AV, after noticing some files (looked encrypted) on my pc which I had no
idea how they got there and they were in a non system/software area of
the drive.
The new AV did a low level (at on drive code level) hard disk, on boot,
inspection and found a hidden (from the OS) partition and deleted it..
That was the beginning of nearly a week of problems, sudden slow downs
for no reason, blue screens, and various AV's then finding pieces of
some sort of key-logging trojans & traces of numerous viruses they had
previously failed to find.. Finally, the cut,  paste, drag and drop
stopped working. nothing would fix it. According to the reports, this
was being caused by a remote control like trojan (possibly now just a
remnant) watching everything going through WinExplorer (looking over its
shoulder so to speak). I got software to remove this and then more to
fix the settings it had left and that led to yet another trojan being
found and removed. It now works OK.
Do you reckon a jscript (code injection) vulnerability over Tor, like
the one you uncovered, could lead to stack based attacks (the system
slow and re-boot) on WinNT/Win2k/WinXP systems, to insert such a remote
control trojan as I have just removed?

Yes, but you'd inject the script later and so not get caught.
I think you'll find that when you need to order the output or filter it,
you need jscript on, if not in the code then that might explain it all.
Maybe there's a way these functions can be turned off by a jscript
injection, forcing the user to turn it on to sue them.
Other than it allowed Tor exits to inject code "This leads
to a persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability where every Tor node
 operator can insert HTML/JavaScript on all vulnerable TorStatus
Yes code injection can indeed can be achieved on the  Q was, can
javascript, in this manner, take advantage of stack overflow
vulnerability, to implant trojans/viruses, I hguess you are saying yes
to this.

Thanks, I've used these, where possible .. testing it out... wouldn't it
be nice to have these settings (and more) with EACH mail account.
Are there any summer projects for Thunderbird? Maybe a student would
like to ADD these user settings / mail account.
If not I'll take a look at the code in the autumn.
Thanks for the help.

@_subject: [tor-talk] flash player 
Flash player is able to leak your real IP when running through Tor Browser, at the request of the video service provider, basically it uses a "phone home" technique, causing Flash Player to directly contact the video service provider without going through Tor.
If you have jailed your Flash Player to Tor only access, using your firewall (e.g free Comodo), then you won't get feed from sites which insist on knowing your real IP (most "cam" sites insist on this e.g. myfreecams, but there are other "video only" site who do this also), you just get a page which says its trying to connect, at the same time your firewall logs should show failed attempts to go direct..
Perhaps the same can happen with Xubuntu or maybe it just blocks the incoming requests.
So it could appear to work under one and not under the other.
Hope this helps.
