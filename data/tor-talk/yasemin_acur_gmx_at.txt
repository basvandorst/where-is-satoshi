@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Bundle Accessibility 
Hello List Members,
My Name is Yasemin. And I am new to the List, so hello.
I wonder what happened in release v3.5 that I am not able to use Tor at all. As mentioned in the subject, i have to use a Screen Reader.
I was used to it that Vidalia is not accessible and never was. But Firefox is. I use Firefox 26 here, the latest german release.
I found out that the Firefox Version is 24.2 in the Bundle, so it should all work. But I cannot do anything but read the Window title. Alredy read the Changelog and browsed in the Configs for helpful ressources without any success.
My OS is Windows (8.1), the Screen Reader is Jaws 14.
For testing purposes on Windows, I recommend NVDA Hope to get helpful answers here. Thanks in Advance.

Thank you for the quick support. And yes, the accessibility bug is no more a trouble in firefox.
With best regards,

but just because I'm curious: Firefox is accessible out of the box. What was the cause for this bug?
regards, yasemin
