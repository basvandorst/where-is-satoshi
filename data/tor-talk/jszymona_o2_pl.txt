@_subject: Tor server not seen 
I run tor server under Ubuntu 2.6.20-16
There are my   /etc/tor/torrc   settings:
SocksPort 9050 # what port to open for local application connections
SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1 # accept connections only from localhost
Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
Nickname xxx
ORPort 9001
There is a   /var/log/tor/notices.log   listing
Jul 17 12:26:44.017 [notice] Tor 0.1.2.14 opening new log file.

What should I do to make my tor server be reachable?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Maintaining your privacy sending e-mails 
Try to use an anonymous e-mail account and connect to that account via
TOR. E-mails shoud be encrypted locally (with GnuPG) so that servers do
not see the unencrypted text. Mail shoul be stored locally on a
Truecrypt volume.
There was a Firefox extension called FireGPG which supported some
webmails but it is discontinued now.
