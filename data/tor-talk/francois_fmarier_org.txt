@_subject: [tor-talk] How to test that Alt-Svc is working for my Onion service? 
I just set up an Onion service for my homepage:
  I added an Onion-Location header on  which points to the
above, but I also wanted to add an Alt-Svc header pointing to the HTTPS
version of it:
  so that TBB could opportunistically upgrade the connection.
However, I can't figure out how to test that the Alt-Svc header is working.
The Firefox devtools don't seem to show anything different and neither does
the the TBB circuit display
Testing  it seems that support for
Alt-Svc is a little flaky.
Is there a good way to test it? Or is it deprecated and should I just
have the Onion-Location header and forget about Alt-Svc?

Thanks Alec! Your suggestion made me realize that I could simply look for
the IP address of my server in order to distinguish between requests from
the local Tor daemon (i.e. using the Alt-Svc) and external requests from an
exit node.
I've documented my setup (including testing steps) on my blog:
