This may have been true in the past, but not anymore. i think the original
version of Greasemonkey worked by essentially injecting custom JS code into
the page, so the custom scripts would run in the page's context. Nowadays,
however, Greasemonkey and NoScript work just fine together. I use both every
It's true that the Javascript code will be longer and perhaps more difficult
to write. On the other hand it will also be more robust for all but the
simplest sorts of preprocessing. I'd be remiss in not mentioning a certain
well-known stackoverflow post:
As for security, it's true that Greasemonkey scripts potentially increase
your attack surface, especially if you use them on pages that are also
whitelisted in NoScript. You certainly shouldn't install scripts from
untrusted sources, and be very suspicious of anything that uses
unsafeWindow. Simple substitutions like you're describing shouldn't be a
significant risk, though.
I haven't ever heard of a tool like you're describing, but it's not a bad
idea, simpler than writing JS and harder to accidentally compromise your
security/anonymity. Perhaps some sort of combination of regexps and XPath to
get the best of both worlds.
