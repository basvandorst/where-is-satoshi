Hi Joe!
I'm answering off-list, because it seems out of focus of the community there and while I understand the need/necessity/advantage/etc. of opensource-sw in certain cases, I'm not a "*nix-nazi" and one of my machines uses windows and KIS2013. I'm also not eager to "out" myself with this to the community.

Do you use the manual mode if KIS? I also tried that feature, but intransparently catching server certificates definitely messed with my system. This function is imho snakeoil of the highest quality. (Except you use an insecure browser and have no idea how ssl/tls and the x.509 certs work.)
I want to be able to check certs myself and it's possible that the cert/ssl-design in tor, which uses (afaik randomly generated,) self signed certs, doesn't work with the "validation" KIS conducts.
It's just a guess, buy maybe that way you get the proper certificate to your pc.
Hope that helps!
