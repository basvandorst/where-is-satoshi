I don't think it would be too difficult to get something like bittorrent working within the Tor network. What I mean by that is both the tracker and all clients are within the network. We'd  have to update the bittorrent client software to not use IP addresses of course, but something similar has already been done on Azureus for I2P. Users of the network would have to set themselves up a hidden service in order to participate.
I'm sure there will be scaling issues involved with the increased number of hidden services and we'd want to optimize some of the transfer parameters but conceptually, it shouldn't be difficult to

The section on Bandwidth and filesharing seems to be dealing with exit nodes. What I'm suggesting is that content is contained within the Tor network so exit nodes are not used at all.
What I don't know is if the non-exit nodes in the Tor network are bandwidth-constrained. If there is extra capacity in the middle or entry nodes, P2P may be a good way to fill that capcacity.

Yes, that's it. I'm sure it's not a new idea, but the few times I've seen P2P discussed within Tor, the discussion centers around the amount of traffic exiting the network instead of doing what it would take to run a P2P network completely within Tor.
