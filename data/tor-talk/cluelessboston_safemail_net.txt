I need to get TOR in able to see a certain website(s).  I'm nervous about installing it as I don't want it to interfere with my other existing programs and my windows operating system etc.....  does anyone know if this will be seamless?

Thanks for the info.  Does it only work with Firefox?  Can I use it with Internet Explorer?
Thanks in advance.
