I think it's time to find a better technical solution to deal with
censorship in different countries.
Censorship is increasing all around the world and we should be prepared
that sooner or later nearly every country will censor the internet for
different reasons (cp, intellectual property, politcal reasons, etc.)
and in a different way.
A perfect technical solution would make it possible to request any
ressource as long as there is just one exit-node which isn't affected by
censorship. But at the moment TOR-Nodes doesn't know which ressources are censored
and which really doesn't exist, so it can happen that you use a circuit
which is not able to bypass censorship.
Putting them on the bad-exit-list is no solution, because first that way
they are lost for the network for all requests which are not censored at
all, and second the specific user has to know that the requested
ressource does exist, which nodes are able to access it and how he can
force TOR to do so.
This could be done better: TOR itself should know which nodes are
affected by censorship and use another for the specific request.
The list could be auto-generated by the exit-nodes. For example an exit
which gets back a 404 or a negative DNS-result could simply ask some
other exit nodes (in a different country) to check if this is "real" or
censorship. If last one, the specific request could be put on a list and
published to the directory.
Other TOR-Servers could use this list to check if they are also
affected; clients would be able to check if the existing circuit is
affected for the specific request and build up a different one.
Not every censorship would be recognized this way, but for the other
ones there could be a button implemented to TOR-Client. If pressed, the
TOR-Exit is forced by the user to do the check.
A nice side-effect is, that we get the neccessary data to check the
censor which could be useful at least in democratic countries which have
no public lists ('cause of index liborium prohibitum).
So far,

You mean anti-censorship is not the goal of the TOR-project?
This will only work as long as you can count censored ressources on the
fingers of one hand, otherwise it will become to complex.
That depends on how big the list would grow. Probably it would make
sense to put these information in a different directory so you can
enable or disable separatley.

Take a look at I2P. There is someone who uses I2P for mail with relay to
the normal Internet (i2pmail.org).
He has some restrictions like you are not allowed to send more than x
mails / day to the Internet; if you want more you have to do a
captcha-like thing on the (hidden) website.

Operators will not be affected (at the moment) if they don't use the

Hi M,
just saw this thread and like to mention that I'm the operator of this
Using a standalone-TOR-Client is a better solution, 'cause there is no
single point of trust.
Express doesn't use TOR but a server-side anonymizing proxy.
Hope this helps and if there are any questions simply ask.

It's always a matter of trust. But as far as I can see anonymouse
doesn't offer https (I do).
I don't know if anonymouse is logging and if so, under which
circumstances they give those logs. I do log, because I'm sitting in
Germany where I'm forced to do so by the data retention law. (I didn't
logged before 01.01.2009, and I will stop it as soon as the law is
overridden by the Constitutional Court.)
Even I'm law-student, so I know a little bit 'bout when I have to give
away the logs and when not. (you can read about this here[1])

Hi Kasten,
These logs (from lighty) are only made for technical reasons, only for
24 hours and only in RAM:
But it's true that I do log; read my mail in response to M from 18:26. I
really regret this, and I'm doing it as transparent as possible.
