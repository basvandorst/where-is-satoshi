@_subject: TOR Park Exit Node Question 
To restate the observation:  When first running TOR Park from an USB device,
one almost always ends up exiting via a site (or two) in the Neatherlands.  I haven't looked at the code, but I suspect another reason that this might
be happening is that the random number generators used to pick the route are
not initialized as well as we might want them to be.
