OK.
 As far as the IDS field - I think they do have their place. and if they were more directed at blocking & disregarding a lot of garbage & known attacks instead of trying to report everything, then a lot more data analysis could be performed on the remainder in order to find the "needle in the haystack".
 I am not aware of the amounts of false positives resulting on other larger networks, although in my experience on a small network the number of false positives has been "almost" 0 Most are practically worthless at detecting unknown attacks, unless you have the analyst as you mentioned.

@_subject: for those not allowing exiting - reasonably safe ports 
I have a list here of ports used by AIM, Yahoo, & ICQ messaging programs.
I think these should be reasonably safe for anyone to allow without having to deal with abuse issues. This should also free up a little bandwith.
 Anyone have anything else to add to the list or any comments?

@_subject: General anonimity/privacy question when using TOR 
Another detail that could comprimise ones anonymity is using webmail or regular email through tor. The mail could be observed as it comes in or out of the tor network unless this is done over SSL. Then an email addresses, passwords, and the like could all be compromised as well as the communications read. Sure all of a persons email may not always come out the same exit node, but a clever party wishing to intercapt communications could setup multiple servers, increasing the amount of traffic intercepted, and over a long period of time a fairly significent of data may be gathered, particularly if you use personal details in communications.
 If others you are communicatimg with are not secure, neither are you.

@_subject: General anonimity/privacy question when using TOR 
So, how secure is the first hop from client to first-tor-server? Assuming the "clever party" sets up multipe servers again, couldn't they intercept a fair portion of the original communication? Unless everyone is running a server as well.
 Of course this all becomes somewhat less of a weakness when there are 10000+ servers. At the moment 50 could intercept a good bit I would think. On Thu, 2 Feb 2006 10:07:20 -0600

@_subject: General anonimity/privacy question when using TOR 
I guess this is already answered in the FAQ though, where it is mentioned that tor does not provide strong anonymity yet.  Question:
 Why not have all the clients route a tiny bit of traffic by default, which can be increased if you want to serve or you can run a standalone server? Or have the server installed by default to route a tiny bit of traffic. With the tens of thousands of current users there are not tens of thousands of servers. On Thu, 2 Feb 2006 10:44:39 -0600

Oh, I see since every server conects to every other server this is not currently possible without having 10,000 connections. Suppose that is why?

 According to the FAQ I should set my bandwidth rate to be less than my maximum bandwidth. Does this refer to upload or download? Anyone else have any settings for cable (roadrunner) that they have found to be good for them?

Ah, yes well I did not say they had or were going to do it. Besides the "ultra-secret-agency-we-shall-not-name-lol" can hack the servers and get the keys if they want to anyway. Then they can use their "secret-monitoring-program-that-does-not-exist-but-everyone-knows-about" to intercept all the communications and decrypt & analyze them on their supercomputer.
 I don't think the servers would have to be widely geographically distributed, since I do not think that tor discerns upon geographic location or (not sure here) ping time. On an internet backbone ping-time would be low anyway. lol, so if 50-100 servers show up in the same spot we all know ;), unless they think of that :0
Course, you know intel agencies live to spend money, who cares the cost. Speaking of your $15 million catch as an example.

I do not know about other facilities available in tor, but you could throttle down your connection rate, and/or only run it when you are using it or during peak hours. That way you will still be giving the network some bandwidth.

Ok, not suprisingly I suppose my IDS is going nutso. As I have set myself up as an exit node this probably means people are hacking through tor. Guess that is to be expected.
 You all have got to do something about this, as this would be a prime argument AGAINST this kind of software. If our isps are shutting us all down there will not be too many servers online.

Oh, I agree, but we should also do all we reasonably can to prevent this sort of abuse short of restricting the rights of persons to use it.
 For instance, a solution similar to hogwash  (which is unfortunately 3 years out of date, no I can't code it) integrated into or available as a plugin for tor.
 At least then we could say that we were doing as much as is possible to prevent this and probably as much as any business in the industry.

Ok, I see a lot of connections with netstat and in the logs. But I also get a message in the logs every so often that I am unable to confirm that the DIR and OR port are available. After a few hours all I receive are log messages that my server cannot confirm that the ports are available and no more connection messages. I am also seeing a lot of "scrubbed" connections and "giving up" messages in the logs.
 I am using the latest stable version, I am behind a NAT firewall, port forwarding has been setup per instructions on both the server and the NAT firewall.

Just thought I would mention this, I just found it, although it appears to have been around for a while. They are selling gateway appliances for business use which include tor, jap, and freenet.

Well that should work. PGP offers more of an illusion of security than most people realize. If someone knows whos email they want to read, and can find you online. All they have to do is hack into your computer, steal your keyfile, and install a keylogger to capture your password, and blam - no more encrypted email.
 Of course this is easier said than done, but still quite possible. To be totally safe you would have to use PGP on a computer that was not connected to a network. You could do this with your method.

@_subject: more letters from the feds 
Problem still exists though, that Tor needs more exit nodes. If nobody is
willing to run an exit server the performance of the network suffers
dramatically. I personally find the performance of the network to be
almost unusable, so I choose other pay-for anonymity services. This is
not a bash of Tor or its design, but as we all know there are simply not
enough servers running to handle the amount of clients.
 Perhaps someone could draft a generic response letter to be sent to law
enforcement if a server operator is contact and post it online or even
include it in the package.

this just happened to pop into my head, and maybe the subject has been

 How about providing a lite version of Tor, or maybe making it possible
with a config file. It strikes me that not all of us who want to use Tor
need the heavy-duty encrytion, indeed some just want privacy from persons
running sniffers on cable networks and such. Just lightweight encryption
with a regenerated key every so often would become cost prohibitive for
the average snoop. This would increase network performance also I would
