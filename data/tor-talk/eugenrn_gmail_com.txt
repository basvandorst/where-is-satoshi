I tried different things, and it still not working.
I'm also sure it is not a network configuration issue. So I tried these:
I compiled myself on the device, the development version of tor 0.2.0.27-rc. Running  it has the same behaviour as stable version: ORPort not reachable.
I upgrade the Debian distribution from etch(stable) to lenny (testing) so I could use the new ARM port "armel" (  ). It says here that the floating point performance is "very much faster", and also that "armel" adds additional features.
I'm not sure if and how much Tor uses floating point operations, but I said I'll give it a try.
So, I installed lenny, armel port, and Tor 0.1.2.19-3 package. Again, same behaviour: everything looks fine, except Tor fails to see if ORPort is reacheable...
No progress so far...

@_subject: [Slightly OT] Theoretical classification of Tor 
Maybe you could think of it like this: If someone evil can shutdown Tor, then Tor is centralized, if not then it is
decentralized... I know too little to answer that...

I want to run a Tor middle node on a NSLU2 device (266Mhz, 32 MB RAM).
I installed Debian etch version on it for ARM platform, and it works great..
I installed TOR package 0.1.2.19-3~bpo40+1, from backports.org (etch-backports distribution).
I configured ORport=9001, nickname=mrffgdeukg, bandwidth limits (70KB), Exit policy reject=*.*. I configured also my router to port-forward 9001 to NSLU2.
Tor starts without problems... It confirms that client functionality works(but I don't use that: SocksPort=0) :
"Jun 07 13:32:37.767 [notice] Tor has successfully opened a circuit. Looks like client functionality is working."
But reachability of the ORPort fails...
In the following log lines, 86.122.58.89 is *currently* my router's IP, and it is *dynamic* IP.
netstat confirms that the port 9001 is reachable from outside (LKG99615B is the NSLU2's hostname). For example:
tcp        0      0 LKG99615B:9001          cpc3-cmbg8-0-0-cus:2184 tcp        0      0 LKG99615B:3461          tor.sabotage.org:9001   tcp        0      0 LKG99615B:9001          squirrel.theremai:58480 tcp        0      0 LKG99615B:9001          2.9.354a.static.t:46954 tcp        0      0 LKG99615B:4882          ks36244.kimsufi.c:https tcp        0      0 LKG99615B:3694          85.214.104.197:9001     tcp        0      0 LKG99615B:9001          cm249.epsilon56.m:56728 tcp        0      0 LKG99615B:9001          tor-exit.miserico:39519 Thanks for reading all this. I really want this to work, and I'll appreciate any  reply. If you want more interesting infos, just ask..

Currently, I have no Address set in torrc. But Tor is guessing it quite In a past test I did set it to what IP router had then, and it didn't help.
As shown by netstat, connections are established on my port 9001 from remote
tor servers...
Also, using the same network configuration (router, dynamic IPs, etc..), I tested Tor
on my laptop, and it reported successful reachability for ORPort.
Yes, my router supports dyndns.org, but since Tor guesses it's IP I prefer not to use dyndns.org yet...
