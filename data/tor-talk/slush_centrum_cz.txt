@_subject: [python] __LeaveStreamsUnattached 
Hi guys, I have quite special question. As I wrote many times before, Im
trying to do some utility in python using Tor. Currently, Im playing again
with core of utility - talking with Tor and downloading some files thru it.
Im trying to download HTTP file thru exact path (defined by router chain).
So I tried to make these steps:
1) Create circuit
2) Create stream
3) Attach stream to circuit
4) Do HTTP communication
Are these steps logically OK? Because if yes, Im in problematic situation.
When I tried to openstream with __LeaveStreamsUnattached=0 (default
configuration), Tor automatically assign stream to any open circuit (but I
want to use one specific). But when I set __LeaveStreamsUnattached=1, I
obtain deadlock on "proxy.connect()" and I cannot continue with point 3).
But I dont found any method, how to obtain stream id _before_ calling
proxy.connect() to pair stream to circuit before calling this function...
Please tell me, what I should do different, because I think I tried
everything :). Yes, I can connect specific circuit with specific stream
(using REMAP), but this solution was very ugly and I dislike them, because
it was firstly make own circuit and I redirect them in next step.
Note: Code bellow is just prototype, so please excuse coding culture :-).
Thank you very much,
PS: Sorry for my english, Im doing my best.
# Step 1 - create circuit thru specific routers
circ = ctl.ctl.extend_circuit(0,["ztorsrv", 'tornodeviennasil'])
print "circ id", circ
# Step 2 - open connection to local proxy
proxy = Proxy(torhost,torproxyport)
# Deadlock with __LeaveStreamsUnattached=1 !!!
# Method is probably waiting to attach stream with circuit
print "connecting to destination"
proxy.connect('slush.cz', 80)
# Im waiting for callback from Tor controller. In stream_id will be
# filled correct stream # assigned with my socket connection.
# In final concept, I will use standard locks etc...
while(not stream_id):
    time.sleep(1)
    print "Stream id", stream_id
print "Stream id", stream_id
# Step 3 - connect stream and circuit
ctl.ctl.attach_stream(stream_id, circ)
# Step 4 - doing communication
proxy.send("GET /tortest.php HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: slush.cz\r\n\r\n")

You are a genius! (An I'm and an idiot because I didn't found this solution
by self!)
I will post final solution after it will works. Currently there is at least
one problem, because after calling attach_stream from another thread (and
Tor returns me SENTCONNECT event), calling of socket.connect() is still
blocking and Tor never send me SUCCEEDED (which I expect as confirmation of
SENTCONNECT). I'm right? What can I do wrong?
Current situation is:
1) Create circuit (main thread) -- OK
2) Call socket.connect() (main thread) -- OK
3) call ctl.attach_stream() from Tor callback handler (it is separate
thread) instead of waiting on stream_id in main thread. It causes to
SENTCONNECT event (with correct stream an circ id), but main thread is still
blocked and Im missing SUCCEEDED event as confirmation...
4) Then, socket.connect() should return socket in main thread, but it never

It looks like you have DoSed some of the faster Tor relays out there,
and then Tor stopped working as well for you. Perhaps these were your
entry guards, so you were particularly strongly affected?
 Tor did not stop serving me. He served me with errors. It is big
difference. In first case, it should be absolutely OK.
Of course, relay dont know, if he is serving 500 users or 500
connection of one user, but no matters. If it is problem of capacity
of relay, it should not accept next connection, if it is full.
And you can do a CPU denial of service too, not just a bandwidth denial
of service, as you say.
I think it isnt answer. This looks like exact and repeatable bug.
Ofcourse, im not Tor specialist, so I cannot say 'it is bug in
filefoo.c'.  While I worked as programmer (now Im only architect,
so Im missing contact with sources), I made server systems with
massive parallel access and millions of daily visitors (simply, I was
developer of centrum.cz). With this experience, I never see problem
like this. Every server system should reject next connection, when its
full. Of course, there is some possibility, that server power is not
used for the edge, but it is much more secure.
I dont know exact defence mechanisms in Tor, Im just using Tor API.
But I think it is very dangerous, that there is simple possibility to
break communication with one simple computer on 256kbit upload link.
Try it against any other server application... As I wrote, I think it
should be perfect, if node, which is reaching its limit on CPU/opened
sockets/whatever should reject all other connection. But I was very
surprised, when it served me with pages I never seen. It is security
problem I think.
 I guess we can put some checks for this particular attack in, for example
by rate limiting the number of create attempts from a Tor not listed
in the directory. But I fear that stopping all DoS avenues is a losing

Is this related to torflow or Coding Project  at
Yes, Im working on similar project as soat.py, but with a little different
method. The main difference is that Im not comparing html page downloaded
via Tor and via direct connection, but I retrieve many copies of the same
page via many exit nodes and doing some transformation on that. Using this
method, I have less false-positives in case of dynamic page. I think it is
the main difference, but there is more little "improvements" (or things with
different implementation).
Originally, I was thinking about improvements of existing soat.py, but there
is absolutely different access to problematic, so it is easy to write it
from scratch. Im just curious, if there is interest from anybody other and
if it is teoretically possible to use my work as (part of) detecting
mechanism on directory servers. Im writing that as part of my thesis, but I
will be glad, if anybody will find useful for self. It can be reason for
writing script as fully working application, not just prototype (code

Hi guys,
Im talking with teachers about running tor node on my university. There is
plenty of unused bandwidth, especially at night :-). But there are some
arguments against tor, so Im trying to find some solutions.
One of arguments was, that tor is used for downloading porn and p2p networks
and university won't support that. Although I partially agree with that, I
know that freedom of speak is main motivation for me and I will fight for
Tor in university. So I found blacklists of pornsites and other stuff (for
example  and think, how I can implement blacklist
to tor exit node.
First solution is to use ExitPolicy. But there is probably limit of listed
IP. I dont know any exact limitation, but because list of restricted IP is
uploaded to directory servers, it cannot be a much. In blacklist are
hundreds of restricted IPs.
Second solution I found is to use transparent proxy and apply filters
inside. In this solution, directory servers and tor users dont know, that
there are some sites filtered and they can be confused. It is also not good
idea, because any good tor scanner (soat or my one) will mark my exit node
as bad exit.
Is there any other solution of my problem? Any proposal? I know that
filtering is not good idea at all, but I have only two possibility. No tor
or filtered one. I vote for tor server with high bandwidth and some

Btw, using more processes for one user is a little bit nasty. Of course, it
can raise up speed of browsing (because parallel processing), but it will
overload tor network (which is still overloaded). This can cause that every

@_subject: How to ban many IPs? 
Thanks for post.
I know it is solution, but I prefer exit node, because I think it is more
universal (it can be used as middleman and also as exit).
There is no question about law (I think there is no problem in my country,
expecially when it is university server). It is only about people on
university, which are against porn and other non-legal activities. When we
will run non-exit router, it is only hiding eyes to problem.
I have one idea, but it is not so clear and systematic. In ExitPolicy
mechanism, router have to export all unwanted IPs. But here can be mechanism
like ExitPolicy, with one difference. List of banned IPs will not be
exported to directory servers, but with attemp to access any resource, exit
node will match it with blacklist (can be very, very long). Exit node then
return error code to tor client, which will change path (and use different
exit node).
I know, I know, it is nasty and Im ashamed for this solution. But it can
solve my problem :) with support inside Tor.

I didnt read Tor path selection very well, but I suppose, that exit nodes
which allow some special address are not preffered by tor clients. So
argument that whitelisting will raise network thoughput is problably false.
More in "path-specification" on
 , especially
part 2 of this document.
Im happy that other people found the same solution like me (Squid), but as I
wrote, I think it is not clear solution. After time, tor scanners will find
that there is problably something wrong and for some URLs is always returned
http error code or something. It is the easiest way to obtain BadExit flag.
As I wrote in mail before, blocking mechanism "on demand" (so not "in
advance" like ExitPolicy) will be the best solution. There can be config
directive (for example) "Blacklist 1" in torrc file, which will
a) Enable some implementation of blacklisting in tor node (reading from
flatfile, subrequest to local service, ...)
b) Export Blacklisting flag to directory servers (like flags Exit, Fast,
...), so tor clients know, that request to this server can be rejected.
c) Tor client after rejection status from this exit node will select another
path (problably exit node without Blacklist flag).
I know it need changes in Tor server, directory servers and tor client (path
selection), but it can be very helpful in some cases. We are speaking in
levels of MB/s of throughput.
Any suggestion?

If there is a demand, I'm able to publish my scanner as hidden service

There are two extremes when checking if two files are the same:

* Both files are absolutely different - we are also happy, because we
know that something is bad
But scanner which consider just these two extremes will throw many
false positives, because world isn't ideal. Just download two copies
of some page few minutes in sequence and you will see. Different
banner? Different language (because you changed IP)? New information
here? Everything these you have to consider and have to report only
important things.
Because it is more heuristic than exact measurement, attacker can
adapt his code to be less harmful and skip notification threshold of

a) Opensource scanner and beat them by spending months on scanner improvements.
b) Leave scanner closed and piss them up (my way)

bitcoins (as government independent currency) is much better combination. So
it is just another point of view to 'waste'.

I forgot to mention that I don't have capable GPU for mining, but I don't
care. When I need bitcoins, I simply go to market and buy some. It is the
same situation as gold miners. Somebody is interested in making big holes to
ground and spend a lot of time and money on that. And somebody do anything
else, like me.
