I'm looking for Tor Developers to test out a project I'm working on for the
Pirate Party of Canada.
Please see Unique features:
- No need to trust nonstandard binary executables. Polipo, tor, vidalia,
piratepack binaries are automatically compiled from source on installation.
- The Tor Browser uses your present Firefox under a profile called "tor".
- Useful Firefox addons are automatically installed.
- For now, we just have a DEB package called "piratepack" that was designed
for the latest Ubuntu, but should work on any Debian based system. Soon we
plan to create an ISO from this that will be based on Ubuntu. It will have a
Live Boot feature and Full Disk Encryption. The Live Boot feature will allow
someone to simply reboot their system from the Pirate Linux disc and choose
to boot a Live Privacy Enhanced OS (such as Tails).
Please send me some feedback. In particular, I want to make sure that the
Tor feature is secure and properly done.

I know, you still have to trust the standard Ubuntu programs such as gcc &
firefox. But, you already made the decision to trust those when you
installed Ubuntu. The piratepack doesn't force you to trust any new

Sorry forgot to answer your first question.
The sources are mostly taken from already quite trusted sources and can be
verified by PGP signatures. You can also read the sources and since they get
compiled on your computer, you know that what you read is what you get.
Also, other people can read the sources and give reviews and you will know
that those reviews actually correspond to what is running on your system.

We want Pirate Linux to be for day to day use, so a Purely Live CD wouldn't
make sense for that. We also want it to be easy to use for beginners,
especially people who are new to Linux, so that's why we chose Ubuntu. But
we can easily make a Debian version from that. We want the installer to
choose Full Disk Encryption by default. It will also install Piratepack to
perform the customization.
On the boot menu the main options will be:
- Try Ubuntu (Live CD with Piratepack, some video introductions & tutorials
on how to prepare the hard drive for a new OS)
- Install Ubuntu (Install with Full disk encryption)
- Start Liberte (A Live Privacy Enhanced OS like Tails)
- Start Tails (Live mode)
So, you can install the main Ubuntu based OS to your hard drive. And in
times where you need extra privacy, you reboot with the disk and choose
"Start Liberte" or "Start Tails".
All this can easily fit on one DVD, and will basically be a showcase of what
our Party views as "freedom".
Of course, this is still in the building/testing phase, so the plans might

Ya its not just the Live CD aspect of it. But also, people aren't going to
use Tor 24/7. So if all internet traffic goes through Tor, that could turn
away users from using it day to day. But I don't know, I haven't tried Tails
since a few months ago so maybe there are some new features I'm unaware of.
Also, its the first time I hear about Haven. Looks interesting also.
As for specifications & documentation, I plan to write that up once I have a
more complete package up and running. Probably in a few weeks...But for now
feel free to test out piratepack, as its a pretty complete package right

Ya but people also like to stream movies, download torrents, video chat. So
I'm not sure if Tor performs well enough for doing those things.

I think this should work:
1) Remove the lines:
from Data/Vidalia/vidalia.conf
2) Add the line
SocksPort 9050
to Data/Tor/torrc
3)./App/Firefox/firefox -P no-remote
and create and run a new profile with Data/profile as the directory

@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidalia no longer portable / --datadir option not 
I'm not sure about Windows,
But this seems to work for me in Linux:
vidalia --datadir Before you run this, put the files torrc, vidalia.conf, geoip into AvoidDiskWrites 1
Log notice stdout
SocksPort 9050
SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1
ControlPort 9051
DataDirectory GeoIPFile /geoip
(Get this from the directory Data/Tor in the Tor Browser Bundle.)
You can do this for other s with different Control and Socks
ports, so that you can run multiple instances (different identities).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor to VPN to Internet = Bad. Why? 
I think in some cases where Tor is blocked, connecting to a VPN through Tor
may be useful. The problem of course is signing up for the VPN anonymously,
but this can be achieved with Bitcoin, to an arbitrarily high level of
security, although at present it's still kind of inconvenient a level of
mixing that would be just as anonymous as Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Adblock Plus and Ghostery should be included in Tor 
I think Ghostery + Adblock Plus + No Script is overkill. Choose one. They
all pretty much do the same thing. Block nasty javascript. No Script seems
appropriate for the Tor Browser due to it's default aggressive stance on
any javascript.
But just curious, which part of Ghostery is closed source, because when I
open up the xpi I don't see any binaries, but haven't looked at everything.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Pirate Linux - First Release 
This is a project I have been working on for the Pirate Party of Canada.
You can see the feature list and download links at The video walk-through is at Some features that are perhaps unique when compared to other distros:
- Ubuntu based together with a package called "piratepack" that installs
all the modifications.
- The piratepack has been tested to work on Ubuntu 10+ and Debian 6.
- Tor & Vidalia run in the background and you can access Vidalia from the
icon on the top panel.
- Tor browser uses your current firefox under a profile called "tor".
- Both the Tor browser and the regular firefox get addons automatically
installed (your firefox settings and history are still working as usual,
it's just as if you installed the addons on top of them).
- Regular Firefox addons: AdBlock Plus, Bloody Vikings, Download Helper,
Ghostery, HTTPS-Everywhere.
- Tor browser addons: Bloody Vikings, HTTPS-Everywhere, NoScript, Torbutton.
- Tor browser automatically launches Pidgin in OTR mode connected to the
oftc.net server through Tor.
- Bitcoin client (both command line and graphical).
- Cwallet: My own program that lets you list the private keys associated
with your addresses in your wallet.dat and make a paper backup of your
wallet in QR code format. Also, it checks to make sure that the keys are
not corrupted. There's both a command line and graphical version.
- Custom Google Homepage: Google SSL search & Pirate search, plus useful
links on top.
- Piratepack modifications can be enabled and disabled through a GUI
- You can launch the Liberte & Tails privacy enhanced distros from the boot
- IMPORTANT: Any binaries that piratepack installs are compiled from source
automatically on installation. You don't have to trust my binaries. Of
course the dependencies (such as libz1g or firefox, etc...) will not be
compiled, but by default come from the standard Ubuntu/Debian repositories.
Piratepack also produces a binary version of piratepack and puts it in
or use it for yourself for installation on another machine. Of course you
can also choose to install the binary version of piratepack if you don't
want to wait for the compilation and you trust my signed binaries. Also,
when doing updates to piratepack, you may want to read the source code
first. In this case you can simply download piratepack from the
piratelinux.org website instead of using the update manager. Or you can
install it from the update manager and then read the source code from the
cache directory /var/cache/apt/archives in order to make sure that the code
is not malicious.
I'm taking a break from this now to focus on other things. But, Ill try to
get some small updates done from time to time and I'm keeping an eye out
for the release of Ubuntu 12, and that's when the next major update will
probably happen.

It's not meant to be lightweight. It's meant to be a general purpose system
that one would install on a hard drive, with a balance between privacy and
usability, as well as various options for increasing or decreasing privacy
based on personal needs. I want to eventually target newcomers to Linux.
The 2.96 GB ISO contains:
1) The alternate Ubuntu installer with the standard Ubuntu (64bit) packages
(Alternate installer is needed for full disk encryption).
2) Piratepack (standard & binary) with all dependencies (required &
recommended) not in the default preinstalled Ubuntu packages (so that the
full installation can be made offline).
3) The Ubuntu squashfs live image (64bit) with the binary version of
piratepack plus all its dependencies (required & recommended).
4) Liberte Linux
5) Tails Linux
That's why the ISO is so large. But, this can easily fit on a DVD or 4GB
usb stick, so I don't see how it's a problem. And no I'm not using OpenBSD
for now, since I think Debian/Ubuntu is much more accessible for newcomers.
As for design document, I still didn't write any formal documentation, but
the source code is all out there, and the features list briefly explains
all the modifications done to Ubuntu.
I'm not sure what you mean by "download helper", but to download this ISO,
bittorrent is the current method I use.
Thanks for the input

@_subject: [tor-talk] Aurora only build 
As far as I know, Aurora is based on something called "Firefox Portable".
Last time I checked, this thing isn't even open source. Can someone clarify
this? Or should I open a new thread?

So are you telling me that standard Firefox depends on closed source
binaries as well? I don't care about how free the license is. I'm talking
about whether it can be built completely from source code.

@_author: AK 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Aurora only build 
Actually, the Tor Browser bundle is built from Firefox Portable binaries.
However, they do say you can build a custom version of Firefox from source
and I guess you can use a similar build procedure to apply those patches in
src/current-patches to the firefox c++ files. It's still pretty unclear,
but I am testing it out, and I'll let you know how it turns out.

If I run two Vidalia instances with unique SOCKS ports and Control ports

SOCKS ports, a remote observer shouldn't be able to know that both my
identities are the same right?

Pirate Linux 1.5 has just been released. The main OS in the ISO is based
off Ubuntu 12.04. You can also just download piratepack, which is a DEB
package which installs essentially the same features and has been tested
on Ubuntu 10+ and Debian 6.
Download page: Features page: Get started with this Guide: Notable Tor features:
- Tor Web Browser that uses your default Firefox. (Contains the addons
Bloody Vikings, HTTPS-Everywhere, NoScript, Torbutton, websocket disabled).
- Tor IRC. (pidgin with OTR connected to Tor with a random username and
some relevant chat rooms added to list)
- Easily create multiple Tor (Vidalia) instances.
- Convenient access from the boot menu to the Tails Amnesic Incognito
Live System (This method of using Tails is not officially supported by
the Tails developers, and some features such as the USB installer may
not work).
Some future plans:
- Only updates get compiled.
- Gentoo package.
- Pirate Linux Server Edition.
But now, until probably October, I'll be too busy to add new features,
so I'll just focus on maintaining bugs and important updates.

booted in the standard way, and all the log messages on bootup and
startup look the same. The reason the USB installer doesn't work is
because it relies on the filesystem mounted to /live/image, which
includes some non tails files, and causes it to think there's not
enough space.
It's meant to easily allow people to try Tails, an if they like it and
they want the official version, they can go to the Tails website and
download the latest ISO.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Pirate Linux 1.5 
Yes. I'm not sure exactly how the Tails upgrade system works, but I
think it requires one to download a tails ISO and either burn it to
DVD or install it to usb using the USB installer in tails or in
another OS. If someone is using Tails booted from Pirate Linux, they
can download the ISO from the Tails website, and use the USB installer
there, it should work as long as they have enough RAM to store the
ISO. If you have more detailed questions, feel free to ask me on IRC
(akarmn, irc.oftc.net).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Pirate Linux 2.0 alpha 
OK, I will try to write something up as soon as I can.
Let me just clarify some points.
Is the goal to be more secure than a standard Linux distro such as Ubuntu
or Debian? Yes.
Is the goal to be more secure than a distro such as Tails or Liberte? No.
For example, instead of using a patched version of Firefox as Tails does,
Pirate Linux uses the latest official Firefox ESR together with the
JondoFox profile to create "the Tor Browser". So there is less
micromanaging of security issues that should in principle be dealt with by
the upstream providers (Mozilla in this case).
The goals can change, but note that for now I cannot guarantee any level of
security, as this would require more testing and probably hiring
professional security auditors. For now I want to make sure all the
features are working as expected, and then eventually, when I am happy with
the functionality, and I have enough resources, I would like to perform a
full audit of the software. Also, more people working on this would speed
things up (I work full time on other things), so I am currently trying to
find some people who would like to help.

Hi Tor Talkers,
Here is the latest release. It's now based on Gentoo (no more Ubuntu), uses
the official gentoo hardened kernel, and XFCE as the desktop environment.
For now it's a live DVD, but eventually I will create an installer that
automatically compiles and installs the operating system (encrypted) onto
your hard drive. More details are here: Always looking for volunteers to help out. Please try it out and tell me
what you think.

@_author: AK 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Pirate Linux 2.0 alpha 
I was expecting you to ask something like that :). Well for now it just an
alpha version, so I would not count on it for robust security. In fact,
security is not the main focus of this project (unlike Tails and Liberte).
Of course, it should still be reasonably secure, but I am focusing more on
ease of use and privacy, rather than bulletproof security. If there is
enough interest, I will make a formal document outlining the model, since I
have been asked this before.
