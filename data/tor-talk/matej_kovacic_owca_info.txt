@_subject: Tor network speed 
I tested Tor on Windows and it looks OK, but... it would be great if Tor won't be in DOS window, but in a system tray and run as a process.
And also.. what if Tor will be combined with firewall. For me, one of the best firewalls on Windows is Personal Tiny Firewall (I am using very old free version).
PTF computes fingerprint for each application which uses internet connection. For instance: if you have Mozilla, PTF checks whether fingerprint (MD5 checksum) of firefox.exe is as it should be. If it is not (someone replaced "trusted" exe with trojan or if Firefox has been upgraded), user is prompted about that.
Now... what if Tor will have similar functionality, but user will be able to decide for every application if it uses Tor connection or not.
So.. your BitTorrent client will not use it, AIM will use it, etc. Not just on / off, but selectively on/off for each application (and when there will be new application, Tor will ask you what to do).
I do not support piracy, because piracy is also bad for open source and free software. But MPAA and RIAA actions could be used for increasing awareness of software like Tor.
Look at the moment to P2P software. You can use it for download, but you also have to upload something (you can disable this, but default setting is like that). It is inconvenient to just download and nothing upload (for example BitTorrent: when you finish, almost in a second someone starts downloading from you). If P2P clients will be designed only for downloading, they won't be successible. So this philosophy that if you want to download, you must also upload sometnihg, forced people to act "sympathetically" and not just egoistically.
This philosophy could be used also here. If you want to protect your privacy, let's protect privacy of others too. And this philosophy could be promoted as a response to antipiracy and especially censorship actions. If every P2P "leecher" will install Tor server, internet surveillance won't be possible on a great scale anymore.
And as seen in a KaZaA example, people are willing to install even spyware to get the benefits of P2P.

@_subject: Data retention in Europe 
Since I live in Europe, just a short explanation of this.
Yes, it is about traffic data and not content. So Tor is a good solution
to this.
But there are some other problems as well.
In US there was a case Smith v. Maryland (Smith v. Maryland, 242 U.S.
735 (1979).), which diferentiates between content of communication and
traffic data. However, there is State v. Hunt decision (State v. Hunt,
91 N.J. 338, 450 A.2d 952 (1982).), which says individual can expect
privacy in traffic data also.
But European Court of Human Rights in 1984 (interesting date :-D) in
their Malone v. Great Britain decision clearly stated that traffic data
are integral part of communication.
There are some legal opinions that data retention won't go through so
called triple principle test. This test requires that regulation must be
a) legal (prescribed by law, law must be accesible to the public) b)
necessary in democratic society for the pursuit of a legitimate aim and
c) proportionate to the aim pursued.
It is also important to know, that European Court of Human Rights
critisized so called blanket measures in other decisions as well. So -
if there is no suspicion, individual should not be put under
surveillance. But data retention is that - surveillance and secret
tracking without prior suspicion.
The other interesting thing is that this directive was prepared and
adopted in very short time. How that?
It is likely that some strong lobby was behind direkctive. However, this
idea of extended surveilalnce is not new and is NOT the consequence of
antiterrorism measures. There are some documents from 1993 which show
that extension of surveillance and harmonisation of this area is not new
in Europe (see Interception of communications, report to COREPER,
ENFOPOL 40, 10090/93, Confidential, Brussels, 16.11.93, published on
Statewatch website in 1997). Terrorism is not the reason for this.
BTW: one of the latest proposals (I thik this version was also adopted)
said retention of data applies to ISP's only. No cybercaffes and public
places included.
The question is what are you doing in cybercaffe and wha in your home.
In cybercaffe you are surfing, posting on forums and checking your mail.
But you are not using P2P applications. P2P applications you are using
at your home.
So which lobby is behind directive?
Actually, there is only one lobby strong enough. This is the lobby of
anti-piracy groups and industry.
It is important to know, that first directive proposals stated that
retention is necessariy for fight against terrorism. But then they
started to talk about "serious criminal offences". What are they?
They are offences, which fall under European arrest warant. The warrant
applies in the following cases: a) where a final sentence of
imprisonment or a detention order has been imposed for a period of at
least four months or b) for offences punishable by imprisonment or a
detention order for a maximum period of at least one year.
Piracy and filesharing fall under European arrest warrant in some
european legislations. OK, it is true, that European arrest warrant is
in "crisis" since German constitutional court rejected it, but note
this: "no limitation to certain types of crimes for which access is
Slovenian Ministry of justice (I live in Slovenia) declared they support
data retention for all crimes which should be prosecuted officially.
So next step will be fighting this directive in constitutional courts
and finally on the ECHR.
Meantime we should propagate using Tor.

@_subject: ExitPolicy abuse 
Probably you are focusing on a wrong problem, You all are looking for possible abuses and methods how to avoid them (blocking some ports, IP rangs, etc.).
But for me the real question is: who is abusing the power in such cases (described in previous e-mails).
I think the real problem of American people is they generally beleive that the State is a potentially Bad Guy, who should be supervised in order to avoid abusing it's powers.
But I think the real problem is becoming private sector. In US you don't have legislation to protect information privacy in private sector (majority of legislation deals with limiting State's power only), and very interesting sign of this problem is privacy in the workplace: since the employer owns all the equipment, it is absolutely reasonable he or she monitors all the activities of employees. (This is not the case in Here we have similar problem. ISP owns the equipment, and this supposedly means they could disconnect you of almost any reason, even poorly argumented. If that has been done by some state court, I am sure everybody would jump up and start screaming it is illegal, "innocent until not proven guilty", etc. Slashdot would be reporting long stories about abuse of state's powers and illegality of such actions.
In this case, we have ISP, which is owner of an equipment and all you simply assume that this fact gives him the right to disconnect you based on one, unproven e-mail complaint. Here ISP is this subject who has the power, and such acts means he is abusing it.
What is wrong with you guys? I mean, I am really interested in if you see this as a problem or not? And if you do - why do not take any actions against this abuses of power?
If I would be the guy in Justice Department, I wouldn't take any legal steps against Tor network. Of course not, because we all know that legal steps against it would cause great public reaction. I would rather annoy Tor users by sending unproven e-mail complaints to their ISP's and with imilar preassures. The result would be the same: destruction of Tor network, but in the latter case, there would be no public reaction.
At the end remains simple question - what is more important: personal rights and freedoms of people OR the right to dispose absolutely freely with private property? I thik the state is not the biggest problem - the biggest problem becomes society.

I think this is an important question.
We should not forget why today is hard to find working anonymous proxy and

Spammers were abusing these systems. That is also why Tor blocks SMTP
The problem is that there will always be some people who will abuse
anonymity services. But such abuse will not be only pretext for government
to ban them, but it will be also great pretext for corporations and
administrators to ban them. Remember Verizon blocking the whole Europe a few
weeks ago?
The problem in general is that privacy is not alternative anymore. You
"must" abolish your privacy if you want to participate in society and
receive consumer goodies. In exchange you receive "safety" and customization
of services.
So what to do? Let's use anonymity tools, but you will be banned from the
majority of sites (external exclusion), OR build in Tor deanonimization
features for some sites (internal exclusion, voluntary subordination) - and

No. US legislation has *in general* different principles for protecting
privacy in private and public sector. Government *in principle* always needs
court warrant. But employer can monitor communications if he owns equipment.
In Europe *in general* there is no difference. In my country I know one case
where someone has been recording telephone conversation she has with someone
else (so she was recording her own conversation with other person). But the
other person did not know about recording. Constitutional court decided it
is NOT allowed. It would be allowed with court order or in a very special
Monitoring employee's communications is also not allowed without court
order. See the decision of Cour de cassation from France No. 99-42.942 dated

I have got a "good" idea for a business.
Let's create an anti spammning list. Invest some amount of money into advertising of it. Maybe create a small application, which will update clients with new block list.
When you will have a wide market share, no one will be able to sent email from "listed" e-mail address to anyone.
Than you can start creating viruses or trojan horses which will send spam and put innocent victiom to your block list.
As found in report CyberInsecurity: The Cost Of Monopoly ( there is growth of new internet users in perifery, that means newcoming internet users are security unaware. This new and future numerous internet users are more vulnerable to viruses, so your "marketing strategy" could have a long and happy future.
And you will be doing double good work: you will fight spammers (whoever they are - see Felten's article Keystone SpamKops ( and you will force "newbies" to become security educated.
And besides, you will get rich.
OK, sarcasm off: I really think this is some kind of stalinism. If someone says you will be punished EVEN you are clearly innocent and even you are a victiom too, this is gangster rule. If this becomes a norm, it means death of rule of the law and wide opens the door to arbitrary stalinistic reign.
I think this is very important problem, endangering our rights and freedoms in the same measure (or even more) as they can be endangered by the government.

A simple example of modifying traffic: Could be easily applied to Tor exit point too.
However, sniffing is not a problem if you are visiting only public webistes (do not exchange any personal information), But traffic injection could be.
Remember Penet remailer? They were accused to help distribute child pornography. It was not true, and it was proved so later. But Penet admin decided to shut down the service anyway because of public preasure.
I am a little worried, that "someone" will try to destroy Tor network by   sniffing, injecting, downloading child pornography/hacking through Tor and doing other nasty things...
I was thinking about a solution to prevent traffic injection in non-encrypted public websites. What about having TWO conection open and do some kind of checking if the content is the same (maybe access the content from two different locations and do some MD5 check). I know the idea is hard to implement, since website can serve different content for each location or every second, and this could also mean double load of Tor network.

We would have then the estimation about actual and potential abuse.
I propose to log just basic information: which port was used for connection. No traffic analysis, no saving information about the target   If it is default POP3 port, then we assume user is not using encrypted connection, and if it is default POP3S port we asume s/he does. Without doing real traffic analysis.
It would also be fine to have spme basic statistics about what kind of "internet services" (web, mail, IRC,...) are people using mostly. That would also help to design trafiic priority in the future...
It would also be usefulto have some basic information which are the most "targeted" servers (we can assume there are Hotmail, and similar), but there is a question whether that is ethical or not. But for design of a network would be fine to know which parts of network must be highly bye, Matej

that every user of a modem (for dial-up) should be registered by the

control, of course.
I have never registered and never had any problems - and the same was

So my explanation is that the control is probalby not so strict. And
sometimes it is possible to get a clearance routinely - officials
usually do not understand technical details and you just say something
that seems reasonably and get clearance.
But on the other side Iran could be sniffing Tor exit traffic to steal
some valuable information (industrial espionage for instance), or to

Well, France has signed Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms (adopted by Council of Europe in 1950).
Article 8 says:
   1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life,
his home and his correspondence.
   2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the
exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and
is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national
security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for
the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or
morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
There are some legal opinions, that banning cryptography or anonymous
remailers is disproportional interference with privacy.
I looked up in the European Court fo Human Rights database, and have
found this case: CASE OF PUZINAS v. LITHUANIA, 14 March 2002
It about a prisoner, who complained because his letters were subject to
cenzorship. Lithuanian law stated that any letters containing
?cryptography [and] cynical or threatening statements shall not be sent
to the addressee?, and also written ?suggestions, applications or
complaints containing insults, jargon or obscenities shall not be sent,
[and that] disciplinary penalties may be imposed on the persons who have
signed? such papers.
Court ruled that the interference complained of was not necessary in a
democratic society within the meaning of Article 8, and therefore there
is a violation of Article 8.
It is interesting, because we are talking about letters from/to prison
and not letters of free innocent citizens. If Court found cenzorship of
prisonner's writings (to his wife and international institutuions)
illegal, then restrictions to writings of innocent citizens must be

this could also be a good idea:
encryption of harddrives from the scratch.
However, I would create a small partition where there will be keys
(files) for decryptig root and home partitions. This small partition
would be encrypted by passphrase. That means you can easily (well...
:-//) change your passphrase for the system (just re-encrypt this small
partition with keyfiles againg).
The only critical software part is then /boot partition. But you can
always fill the /boot up to 100% with random data and run Tripwire
integrity checking on it. If it is full, it is hard to write additional
code on it. And if you do integrity checking, you can easily discover if
something changed.

Well, remaining silent is violation only if you are silent AS A WITTNES

You can always be silent when talking to the police. In SLovenia police
can ask you to came to the police station to give a statement. You must
gothere, but youn can ALWAYS say: I "came here, but I don't want to talk
about that. Googbye". And if they ask you to stay, you can ask them: "Am
I accused of sometnihg". And they MUST answer yes or no. If "no", you
are free to go. If "yes", you have the right to lawyer.
And you can always refuse to answer to a question which could lead to
prosecution of you, or bring you to a great shame.
It could be that some "new, antiterrorist" legislations abandon this
rights in some (less democratic :-)) ) countries. But there is European

That is correct. But privacy protection - I mean personal data
protection - is also cenzorship.
There are some forms of cenzoship, which are bad, but there are some
forms of it which can be justified.
The difference between porn and child porn is the abuse of a child.
There is also privacy violation of a child, which can not give conscious
consent. I think cenzorship in that case is justified.
OK, it is a problem of being punished for only possesing child porn,
however idea is very simple: if there will be no demand, there will be
no supply. But I agree, in general that could be a problem. For instance
DMCA prohibits freee speech in area of removing copyright protection.
The problem is that ideas and possessing information becomes illegal,
not some explicitely hurting criminal act.
But the same problem is with freedom. By prohibiting murders, my freedom
is limited, someone could say. In general iti is correct, probititing
murder is a kind of restriction. But it is obvious that it is good

OK, this need more clarification.
First of all, I am not pro-cenzorship.
But I think that freedom of speech is not unlimited. And if it is not
unlimited, that involves some form of cenzorship.
Foir instance shouting "fire!" in full theatre could be viewed as
freedom of speech, but also as a crime, because there will be panic and
lot of people would be dead.
So it is reasonalby to restrict freedom of speech, when we are
protecting some other important liberty. (OK, another problem is that
government is "protecting" us against "terrorists"...)
Could be problematic, when you are talking about privacy violation. I
don't want my personal data, pictures, etc. published. I have a right to
restrict publication of that information. And that is some form of
Yes, I know why is that problematic. I am just explainig what the
legislators were thinking of. However, in case of paedophilia, there
were some research (empirical data) about paedophiles. And Megan laws in
US were enacted because there is empirical evidence that 70% of the
paedophiles are commiting crimes again.
I know, this is problematic, and I am not pro Megan laws for some other
reasons, but they have some arguments. If there is empirical evidence
that cutting demand will cut the supply - and if there is strong
correlation between these two factors, that is pretty good argument.
However, we have not seen any analysis of anti-terrorist's measures (how
more safe we are because of them, which are successfull, which not,
etc.). That is the problem.
Actually it's simple - and not secret. State of law, transparency of
police, secret services and government, etc. All things we had few years

@_subject: end-to-end encryption 
this is not directly connected to Tor, but I think it is important issue because we need good support programs for Tor. By support programs I mean Firefox, etc. which USE Tor.
The problem is people are extensively using webmail. They can use "mobile" Tor (TorPark), but the problem is the content of the webmail is not encrypted. So they can get anonymity, but not end-to-end encryption (so anonymity is also downgraded).
I was reading this blog:  and comments, and got an idea how to enable better security for users using web mail.
My idea is to build GPG into Firefox or at least integrate it more deeply. GPG keyring (user's private and public key) should be an object similar to certificate.
User will be able to create/import keyring into Firefox, export it or delete it. Keyring could be secured with password (with FireFox security device), and additionaly with passphrase. Public keys could be easily retrieved from public key servers wia Firefox.
How decryption will work?
If FireFox will detect PGP/GPG code (in a form), it will enable decryption.
This need more thinking in detaila, but in general when decrypted, it will be "grabbed", decrypted and shown in plaintext. Similar to Enigmail extension for Thunderbird.
So user could be able to use strong end-to-end encryption + anonymisationn from his/her USB drive.
My observation is, that more and more services are moving into the iternet - and mostly into web. So web browser is a central technology for browsing, reading email, writing teksts (Writely), publishing things, configuring software, watching movies... even runnig OS (see YuOS for example) And web browser is becoming independent from other systems. In a future local operating system could be only web browser with connection to the internet. That is why we need end-to-end encryption built into it.
If you find this idea reasonable and interesting, please promote this feature request:

In fact SSL won't be replaced. It will be used together with GPG. SSL is for preventing different type of attack - preventing eavesdropper between you and webserver. It is a standardized and widespread solution so there is no need to abandon it. But it dose not solve the problem of webmail stored on a webserver.
In fact - if I want to use GPG via webmail, I can't do this in an easy way. Or I have my keys stored on a webmail server (which is obviously bad), or I copy GPG'ed text to clipdoard decrypt it and copy it back. And of course - there is no widespread platform for this. I have to install GPG. While for using SSL I don't need to install anything.
And there is not just a question of webmail. You can GPG other things on the web. USENET, blog records, have a database with encrypted content which is decpryted locally, etc.

"that more people get 'busted', therefore draining the fund even more."
No, because when there will be one case when under some circumstances Tor operator will be freed, there will be no legal action againt other Tor operators anymore.
But I see one big problem with EFF. EFF is an US-based organisation. They do their job very well, but in USA.
For instance, if I get busted in Slovenia EFF can't help me. The don't know slovenian legal system, they don't have a list of lawyers in Slovenia, etc. I am on my own.
So my suggestion is to promote a development of country based organisations similar to EFF, which will cooperate on the international level. It would be also more convenient (and trustworthy) to transfer money for legal defense from international organisation to country organisation which knows all the local circumstances.
In Slovenia we have an unformal group of privacy aware individuals. We are working at the universities, as a lawyers in a courts, as a journalists and at ISP's. We do not have a formal organisation yet, but sooner or later we will do that move. We are communicating through the internet, some of us are even preparing some legal cases (offer legal, money and expertize).
I think we need such a group in every country, not just USA and Germany. It is important that people in that organisations are highly educated in legal area also. And that groups should be general privacy oriented, not just Tor. That would be first step. The second would be to create a strong international connection between them and to establish "good organisational practices" to prevent corruption and incompetence.

I would just like to let you know that Slovenian government (Slovenia is a member of European Union since last year) a week ago decided to block two on-line gambling sites, because they do not have a licence to operate in Slovenia.
There are several problems with this, the major is that Office for Gaming Supervision sent a simple letter (not an official order!) to ISP's to block the site (what about "mere conduit" doctrine???) and major ISP's just did it. It is also funny, that European Court of Justice ruled in 2003 that across-border gambling like that is legal, because EU has free movement of services enacted (see case Gambelli). My personal opinion is that this cenzorship is illegal in many ways, but the problem is that ISP's dont want to oppose governemnt and they simply don't care about their users's rights.
But this also opened a great possibilities to inform people about Tor as an anti-cenzorship tool, and of course I did it. :-))
So I just wanted to let you know that illegal cenzorship is not just something which is happening in China. And I hope a lot of people in Slovenia know about Tor now and see it as good anti-cenzorship tool.

Yes. But if member states would prohibit gambling at all - they could say it is in public interest because gambling is bad. But member states does not this - they allow gambling for some domestic companies only. So they are limiting free movement of services, which is illegal.
In Slovenia we have a special law, which states ISP's are not resposible for content they transfer (if they do not initiate the transfer or look into packets). Our "gambling office" said that ISP's are responsible for helping online gambling sites if they do not block access to them. It is not true - it is in direct contradiction with law.
And it is also illegal to order ISP's some action with a simple piece of paper, without legal notice. That's why I said it is illegal.

Hello Matej,
I already commented that "review" on AMO.
It is nothing but a Hoax, maybe a bad joke!
That means nothing is true about it.
There is someone who wants to get some more visitors to his website,
doing so by posting sensational stories on that well visited site.
I'm absolutely sure that this story will be removed by AMO editors

@_subject: [tor-talk] Transparent e-mail encryption? 
I know this is a bit off-topic, but since here are people who know a lot
about security and since I was unable to find relevant answers I would
like to ask one question.
PGP Corpotation has one interesting solution, called PGP Desktop Email.
PGP Desktop Email is email encryption software that automatically
encrypts email as it is received and sent on desktops and/or laptops,
without affecting the end-user email experience. PGP Desktop Email
operates as a proxy, supports the two global email encryption standards,
OpenPGP and S/MIME and automatically discovers keys and certificates as
So, my question is, is there something similar in opensource land?
What solution I am looking for?
On a server side there should be a simple script, which would
automatically encrypt all incoming e-mail with recipient public key. All
e-mail is then stored on a mail server in encrypted form.
O a client side there would be nedded an application (daemon), which
would transparent and automatic decrypt all incoming e-mail. Mail client
would connect to this daemon, and this daemon would connect to mail
server (through PO3 or IMAP), get messages, decrypt them and pass them
to mail client. If daemon receives e-mail in plain text, it should pass
warning to user. The same with GPG errors.
What we get from this setup?
First of all, mail messages are stored in encrypted form on a mail
server. It is true, that attacker could break into the server and switch
the GPG encryption off, but he cannot view already encrypted messages
(we get past security). The other option is, that e-mail server already
uses full disk encryption (TrueCrypt or LUKS), but the main password get
abused (or server hacked). In that case users still have security of
their personal mail guaranteed, at least past messages. (Analogy to LUKS
full disk encryption and EncFS encryption of user's /home folder in
Ubuntu: all users of a machine must have LUKS password to boot the
machine, but when they do that, they would still need user's password to
access his or her /home folder).
On a client side, client can use insecure protocols, but user's mail
would still be protected during transfer. Even if attacker get user's
password, he would be unable to read his emial without his private key.
This is also important when using mail client through Tor.
Another thing is that mail client will always get unencrypted mail,
which can be indexed. If decryption would be done in mail client,
indexing would not be possible. However, it is important to note, that
local storage of mail client should be enrypted (LUKS or EncFS) or
located in a trusted environment.
There is also not problematic if we receive already GPG encrypted
e-mail. Mail message would be double encrypted on a mail server, but
mail client will receive only one-time encrypted mail message and there
will be no usability problems (no need for user to run decryption second
time). There will also be no problems with GPG keys. Mail client looks
for a public key of a sender, and since mail mesage would be decrypted
by daemon, there would be no need to manually select correct key. There
will also not be a problem with replying - usually if user receive
encrypted mail, reply is also encrypted. Here behaviour of a replying
would be "normal" (however messages stored in reply folder on a server
would also be encrypted by the server), and there will be no problems
with selection of recipient's public key. This solution can also encrypt
complete message - including mail header.
The only "bad thing" is that user would need additional software
installed on his machine (this daemon), that mail admin should install
the encryption script/software and that here will be a little more
problematic to read e-mail through web interface (however, this could be
solved, but searching through web IMAP won't be possible). And of
course, this apllication should be available for different, also mobile,
operating systems.
So - is there some similar solution and if not - is there someone who
would like to help developing such a solution?

BadVPN is an open-source peer-to-peer VPN system. It provides a Layer 2
(Ethernet) network between the peers (VPN nodes). The peers connect to a
central server which acts as a chat server for them to establish direct
connections between each other (data connections). These connections are
used for transferring network data (Ethernet frames), and can be secured
with a multitude of mechanisms.
P. S. I remember one of the developers a few years ago said, Tor will
support UDP connections some day.

@_subject: [tor-talk] encrypted mailing lists 
With all respect, but I don't really agree here.
I think that it would be really great if Mailman (and other mailing list
applications) would support encryption. When user will register to
mailing list he or she should send his/her public GPG key to the Mailman
server. He/she would then receive public GPG key of mailing list.
All mail sent to the list should then be encrypted (recipient is mailing
list address and user has it's public GPG key). Mailing list would then
decrypt it, and deliver that message to it's users encrypted and signed.
That approach would resolve several problems:
- user would know that messages are really coming from mailing list (no
impersonation here);
- no spam anymore (or at least much less spam) - registered users would
need to send encrypted e-mails to mailing list, all other messages will
be dropped;
- messages are sent to user in encrypted form (regardless mail archive
is public or not) - prevents eavesdropping on public places for instance;
- messages stored in user's mailbox are encrypted (this could be
important in some countries (don't forget bordercrossing!). Even if
mailing list archive is public, this prevents automatic forensic tools
to get useful information from the seized disks;
- if mailing list is not public messages in an archive are really safe
(remember quintessenz and NSA mailing list archive story? :-> );
- if mailing list is public messages in archive are still signed and
their itegrity could be checked;
- this would promote encryption in several ways: users would be "forced"
to use encryption and users would get familiar with encryption;
- and this is also important: more e-mail traffic would be encrypted by
default - that makes all us who use encryption more safe. Remember: NSA
thinks that everybody using encryption should automatically become a
target od broader surveillance - let's overload them).
I believe we should ask Mailman developers to include that functionality
in the future releases.
What do you think?

move on, etc.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Obfsproxy question 
I am not sure if this is a correct place to ask, but I will risk.... :-)
I am trying to set up OpenVPN server with Obfsproxy. I am using
Obfsproxy 0.2.13 on both sides (server and client).
On server (Debian 9), there is OpenVPN server listening on 443 TCP port.
I am also using port sharing in OpenVPN so if someone connects to my
server to 443 port with OpenVPN, he gets OpenVPN connection, but if
someone connects to my server to 443 port with web browser (HTTPS), it
will get website. (This is possible because OpenVPN can distinguish
OpenVPN and other connections - others are relayed to webserver running
on localhost on some other port.)
Then I run Obfsproxy on the server with the following command:
sudo obfsproxy --log-min-severity=debug
--data-dir=/tmp/scramblesuit-server scramblesuit
--password=ZKRSAUKWPH6A3GMINURTUG2I6GJQR4ZV --dest=127.0.0.1:443 server
So basically, server is listening to port 8080 and relaying all
connections to 443 TCP where they are taken over by OpenVPN.
Now the client side (Ubuntu 17.04).
I installed Obfsproxy via pip install and am running this command:
obfsproxy --log-min-severity=debug --data-dir=/tmp/scramblesuit-client
scramblesuit --password=ZKRSAUKWPH6A3GMINURTUG2I6GJQR4ZV --dest
xx.xx.xx.xx:8080 socks 127.0.0.1:10194
So basically, Obfsproxy is connecting to my server to port 8080 and
opening socks on client's localhost on port 10194.
And finally, OpenVPN client config has basically just socks-proxy line
remote xx.xx.xx.xx 443
proto tcp
socks-proxy 127.0.0.1 10194
dev tun
Now the problem is, that when I run OpenVPN client, it can't connect and
the problem is in Obfsproxy client.
Here is the Obfsproxy's log:

Is this problem somehow connected with warning about session_ticket.yaml?
Directory /tmp/scramblesuit-client/scramblesuit/ on a client exists, but
is empty.
Any help will be much appreciated.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Obfsproxy question 
============================== START ==============================
Basically, I would like to have only ports 80 and 443 open. On 443 will
be TLS encrypted traffic (but in fact HTTPS website and OpenVPN), while
on port 80 will be HTML traffic (while in fact plain HTTP site and
obfuscated VPN).
Now, my problem is, that OpenVPN traffic could be distinguished from
HTTPS traffic with deep packet inspection.
I could avoid that by "wrapping" all communication in Stunnel, but the
problem is then with the clients. Clients are various devices, including
Android phones and iPhones.
So  in order to enable various clients to use VPN, I agree to use "fake
obfuscation" on 443 port.
But there are some clients who cannot connect to the uncensored Internet
at all. They of course would be highly motivated to use some Linux
distribution with additional software packages. And for them will be
port 80.
