And if you're using firefox (as you seemed to indicate in your first
post), select tools/downloads from the FF menu.
What Android release is this device running?

You need to provide more specifics for anyone to be able to give you
much help.
What "Tor" are you trying to download, from where? Provide the
URL(s). [If you are doing this from the app store with the "google
play" app installer, go to  with
a browser, locate what you're after, and provide the URL(s) for the
app(s) that way.]
I am not aware of any issues with downloading large files with
firefox for android. If you are trying to do this over cell data
your mobile carrier may be imposing restrictions, but that's a
separate issue.
