Currently the site is kinda basic so if you have any theme suggestions let

I'd beg to differ. There are very good VPN providers that keep absolutely
no logs so you would have anonymity in that case. I think a commercial vpn
without logs is the best way to go but you could also handpick nodes (tor
needs to have a auto feature which can auto pick nodes by country. Covert
Browser for IOS allows you to pick your exit node.

TorMail as it is secure and it is hard to trace as access is only on the

Sometimes I'll need to use a forum and some of them block Tor but not my
VPN. Is there a way to disable Tor in the browser bundle? I thought the
button did it but...

You can check the source code. No back doors. Plus people at the FBI have
used it for anonymity...

Hey I'm averaging 1.5MBPS Up and Down, 1001 inbound, 628 outbound, and 28
exit connections. Is this normal traffic? I know Tor is under heavy load
from the new bot net but this is a huge amount of traffic...

@_subject: [tor-talk] The reasoning behind the 'exit' flag definition 
Interesting how the flag works. I think it should be just at least one port
with access to one IP address. Also can you really get banned from Gmail? I
access my accounts from normal inet, VPN, and Tor depending on what I'm
doing... For example I have some emails I only access via Tor...

We are not concerned about the price but rather we are concerned about our
freedoms to share change etc the source code to suit our needs. Furthmore
some of us are very paranoid. Also why can't u make a open source bios?
What are u hiding from us? Your NSA backdoor!

I like that idea. We need processer companies to stop owning their products
and to just let them go after we buy the product. It sucks being locked

Wow are you guys really going to argue over what operating system or
version the guy uses? He just wants help getting Tor to work on his old
operating system. Personally I think Tor should work on Windows 95+
Computers and should be kept light weight as possible... Also sorry to hear
about your head injury that must be hard to deal with :'(
