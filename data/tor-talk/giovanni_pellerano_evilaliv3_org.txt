yep, eventually it could be implemented a trick that vecna used in
SniffJoke and i reimplemented some years ago in Janus:
this way nathan things can be done really more in a transparent way.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor2web support for HTTPS on .onion 
Dear all,
We?re happy to announce the release of Tor2web 3.1.30 [1] that includes
support for access to .onion sites over TLS.
Tor2web[2] is HTTP proxy server software used for accessing onion sites.
The Tor2web support for TLS includes the following security features:
- TOFU  (Trust on First Use) certificate validation by caching the
fingerprint of the .onion site
- Validation of CN (Common Name) and SANs (Subject Alternative Names)
specified in the certificate of the .onion domain.
As Facebook has recently opened its own onion site [3], we?ve been
coordinating this release with Alec Muffett from Facebook in order to
block access to Facebook by means of the Tor2web proxy. Because Facebook
has a normal website, using Tor2web merely presents an option for users
to hurt themselves.  You can see the Facebook block here:
Current Tor2web conduits are:
- tor2web.org (running 2 out of 3 servers after recent server takedown
due to CryptoWall abuses)
- tor2web.fi by Ahmia (
- onion.lt
- onion.to (temporally dead after server takedown)
- tor2web.blutmagie.de (expired certificates)
We remind the community that Tor2web yearns for additional operators.
If you want to run a Tor2web conduit or otherwise support Tor2web:

sure Andrew, i'm glad of your interest in knowing more.
Tor2web is basically a proxy for Tor Hidden Services designed by Aaron
Swarz and Virgil Griffith. The software was designed in order to
support freedom of speech and amplify the visibility/reachability of
the contents onto the public internet surface by making possible
normal web users to visit hidden services resources by means of a
common browser and without the need for the user to install Tor/TBB.
from end-user point of view, every hidden service is reachable this way:
  is mapped onyo In addition depending on the software configuration there are various
use cases possible:
1) one can setup an independent generic proxy like for example
tor2web.org and provide access to whatever content of the darknet to
normal web users by means of a common browser. you find more info
about current nodes part of the let me say official network or totally
independent on the github wiki page [1] [2].
2) one can setup a specific proxy for a single or few hidden services.
e.g. we use it in Globaleaks [3] where, depending on the threat model
of the whistleblowing initiative [4], a Tor2web setup can be
instantiated in order to provide reachability for anonymous
whistleblowing initiatives and the reasons may vary:
- the initiative want to provide a landing page for the whistleblower
accessing the initiative while still not accepting submissions over
Tor2web (e.g. - the initiative is runned by anonymous that protects the real
infrastructure behind an hidden service but they user Tor2web want to
amplify their reachability on the internet: e.g. mafiealeaks runs this
way (

Security Advisory - 22 February 2015 18:00 CET
GlobaLeaks directory traversal vulnerability has been discovered and fixed
GlobaLeaks software, starting from recent version 2.60.54 released 28
January 2015 during an intensive session of customization for new
whistleblowing projects, introduced a directory traversal vulnerability.
On 16 February 2015, with release of version 2.60.62 the issue has been
We invite anyone that installed or upgraded GlobaLeaks software between
28 January and 16 February, whose initiative is not publicly indexed on
Wikipedia, to upgrade!
Vulnerable versions
The GlobaLeaks versions reported to be vulnerable:
2.60.61 - 2015-02-12
2.60.60 - 2015-02-10
2.60.59 - 2015-02-10
2.60.58 - 2015-02-04

2.60.55 - 2015-01-29
2.60.54 - 2015-01-28
The vulnerability could potentially enabled downloading all files in
Out of the initiatives publicly using GlobaLeaks [1], only 4 out of 23
were found to be vulnerable due to installation/upgrades done in the
past few weeks.
We coordinated in few hours the release of the fix and the upgrades with
the adopters and the infrastructure partners that are now safe from this
An analysis of the log files of /var/globaleaks/log/globaleaks* with
that 4 users revealed no disclosure of sensitive information, like the
configuration database of the GlobaLeaks node.
To check for exploitation of this vulnerability the right command is:
grep '////' /var/globaleaks/log/*.log*
The vulnerability has been introduced with commit
4d59f7cc23256abf0e26755b0005044813e9c225 [2] fixing the issue  [3].
The vulnerability has been fixed in commit
495c8e33a98e29a4bbe471f98d240ee9e077c738 [4].
It shall be further noted that, if globaleaks were deployed on a system
without AppArmor properly activated/installed, the vulnerability would
enable the download of all files of the system that are world-wide
readable, because of a collateral bug that did not prevent globaleaks
from starting if AppArmor was not available (but enabled, as it is by
Release 2.60.62 fix this issue also; now GlobaLeaks won't start if the
AppArmor check fails.
It should be noted that since all submitted documents are encrypted
using openPGP this content was never exposed or endangered due to this bug.
We want to thanks a hacker (that prefers to remain un-named), supporter
of opensource and anonymity software, that spotted the security bug and
responsibly reported to us, allowing an ordered handling of the issue.
As GlobaLeaks team we apologize for the inconvenience and for the
pressure we?ve put on the adopters to upgrade so quickly and to assess
if any real information exposure happened.
This vulnerability has been introduced by mistake by working/supporting
the customizations and improvements of new whistleblowing projects that
are now starting on a monthly basis, bringing a lot of pressure.
We?re better organizing our procedures, getting out from
over-working/under-pressure, with proper code-review and release
management for any new public release.
The many major improvement being done under 2014-2015 Roadmap will
further improve the software with multi-process segregated architecture
(postfix?s like) and client-side encryption.
We are committed to full transparency regarding our software development
practices, including security vulnerabilities, publishing all
Penetration Tests Results [5], inviting for new bugs to be spotted by
hackers that work for the greater good with our Bug Bounty program [6].

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor2web 3.1.41 release with GetTor & CheckTor 
Dear all,
We?re happy to announce the release of Tor2web 3.1.41 [1].
This release includes the following important features:
- Tor2web GetTor: that provides end-user a super-easy-automatic way to
download Tor Browser
- Tor2web CheckTor: that enables third party sites to check if a user is
behind Tor
- Improved URL rewriting for JS, CSS, and XML files
- Improved packaging and signing
Most of the improvals are thanks to a private donation by Virgil
Griffith in relation to the Onion.city project [2].
 Tor2web GetTor
Tor2web GetTor [3] is designed to enable third party to design and
develop their own Tor Browser installation instruction, by simplifying
and localizing that process.
It serves the latests stable Tor Browser for Windows and Mac OS X
directly from any Tor2web public or private server on the following URL:
* /gettor : gives you the latests TBB for your OS/Language
* /gettor/signature : gives you the signature file for the latests TBB
for your OS/Language
It automatically detects the operating system (Windows, Mac OS X) and
language, by serving the right TBB installation file.
For iOS and Android does redirect to the Apple Store and Google Play.
Documentation of Tor2web GetTor is at

The corresponding ticket for development is at
Tor2web GetTor feature comes from a functional requirement for a
GlobaLeaks deployment for Amnesty International.
The feature is the result of a collaborative effort between Hermes
Center (Giovanni/Fabio) and Ilv ( working
on the Tor Project?s GetTor
 Tor2web CheckTor
Tor2web CheckTor [4] enables a third party website, to verify if a user
is connecting over Tor or not, in a flexible way with the regards to the
different usage/integration requirements.
It serves an HTTP Header X-Check-Tor (true/false) on each Tor2web
response, additionally providing a /checktor embeddable URI (CORS
enabled) that provide a data format compatible with
 .
CheckTor.js and CheckTor.html examples have been written in order to
simplify user adoption and integration inside third party websites:
Documentation of Tor2web CheckTor is at
 .
Tor2web CheckTor comes from a functional requirement for a GlobaLeaks
deployment for OCCRP (Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project),
where we designed a new "Integrated way" to deploy Whistleblowing site
We invite the Tor community to contribute, evaluate, constructively
criticize those additional facilities we?ve integrated into Tor2web.
