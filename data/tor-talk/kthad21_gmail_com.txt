@_subject: [tor-talk] Help-not downloading 
When I try to open tor from my downloads, it says “Tor unexpectedly exited. This might be due to a bug in Tor itself, another program on your system, or a faulty hardware. Until you restart Tor, the Tor browser will not be able to reach any websites. If the problem persists, please send a copy of your Tor log to the support team.”
I have deleted and re downloaded Tor like 10 times now and it still pops up with this message. Is there any way I can fix this so I can finally use Tor.
