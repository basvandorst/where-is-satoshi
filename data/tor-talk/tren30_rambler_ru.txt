@_subject: [tor-talk] Idea for optimize traffic 
Hello I have an idea to optimize traffic when transferring files, torrent, and so
on. It is necessary to encrypt the file, and cut out of every ten (20, 100,
variability) byte. The basic package sent directly from person to person or from
a smaller number of nodes. A small part, without which it is impossible to open,
send through your system to normal or hard rules. When all the parts come, they
are connected together. For encryption can be used fast and demanding algorithm,
but that is well mixed data.
