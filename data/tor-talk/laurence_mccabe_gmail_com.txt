Firstly congrats and thank you for the wonderful tool that is fantastic!!!!!
just wandering, is there a way to set an ip address? so it is not
anonymous? i would like to set one in brisbane australia that different to
mine, and if possible set the computer info sites take to another
computer.. like using a vps..

yeah, so setting the ip address to a fixed location, is that possible? or
at least so it can be tracked, but to a location other than mine, like
using a remote computer
