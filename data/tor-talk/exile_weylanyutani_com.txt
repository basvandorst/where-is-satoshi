@_subject: IRC zombie controllers 
Gibson Research, home of Shields Up, has an excellent description
of IRCbots and his story of chasing one of them down:
Look down in the middle once Steve gets his hands on a zombie
and finds them using IRC to "check in" with their operator
and wait for commands.
Enjoy, its a classic but great reading none-the-less...
and using TOR to mask IRC would REALLY make zombie nets
like this easy to control.

LOL! This is why I love the Internet!
GRC was the fastest example of the exact IRCbot net description that I could point to/think of.
Digging on securityfocus or your info-source-of-choice will uncover more/better.
I am sure checking at various anti-virus vendor libraries
will show even more.
In any case, all of that would satisfy the original
requests for examples of IRC being used to control
zombie hordes, and like behavior.
True, but not exactly relevant to the original question,
which was about using IRC in annoying ways that prompted people to institute blocking?
Of course, we could also go off into esoteric covert channels
with trojans that encode their commands and responses on
mutated headers such as over TCP:
Now I am wondering how well stuff like that would go
through TOR? Might set something up and test it just
for kicks.
But I digress...

@_subject: Tor... the new "code 4GH" 
This sounds like the the "4GH code" from John Brunner's
novel, "The Shockwave Rider".
For those who have never read it, imagine the novel that
could result if George Orwell's 1984 was in a car accident
with William Gibson's Neuromancer.
The Shockwave Rider is a cyberpunk novel from before the
term cyberpunk was even coined and is a great read for
anyone interested in anonymity.

@_subject: chaining JAP and Tor 
AFAIK, JAP is totally compromised by at least the German gov't.
There are many long-running discussions in the Freenet/Frost forums
about JAP being compromised. Most Freenet users refuse to use it.
This configuration allows the people who compromised JAP to trace
all of your traffic, even into the TOR network. Even if the traffic
was encrypted before entering JAP, traffic analysis is possible.
The configuration above seems to imply your traffic is passed to JAP
first, making that the first/best point to compromise the entire
Personally, IMHO, I would drop the JAP connections entirely, due to
the numerous complaints I have read on Freenet about how it has been
backdoored/compromised by elements of the German government, and possibly others.
I personally have not examined the source (if available) and everything
I am reporting is purely hearsay. But, I thought it worth mentioning
so that you could do your own research about the possibility.

@_subject: chaining JAP and Tor 
All correct, and in response to the FUD piece, this is why I was
careful to label it as my opinion, just as it is only your opinion
that it is not. Also, I made sure to point out that even on
Freenet, it was only hearsay and recommend the JAP users to make
their *own* investigation, and determination.
I am not intending to spread FUD, merely provide a cautionary
note to people who may not otherwise have heard any of those
rumors. Raising awareness was the intent, not FUD.
Caveat emptor still always applies.
And in the end, we both recommend do your own inspection, so
it seems we are ultimately violently agreeing with each other.

@_subject: Using Gmail (with Tor) is a bad idea 
It makes no sense to me at all to use TOR to access
a service nominated (and shortlisted) over and over
for Privacy International's "Big Brother" Awards:
I think 2005 was the third time Gmail was shorlisted?
I don't know how much of is quackery, kookism, or paranoia, but if even a
fraction of it is true, there are some scary abuses
already possible and more waiting to happen.
