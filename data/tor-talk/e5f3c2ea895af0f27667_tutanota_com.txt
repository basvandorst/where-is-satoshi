This is very nice and very useful, it will really help with getting more people to
deploy more tests and gather more measurements. Tested the app on Android and everything went fine. There should be a mention of the mobile app here? Best wishes,

You can use Thunderbird inside a Whonix workstation (it's already included by default) and have it connect to the Whonix gateway, so that all the traffic is tunneled through Tor. I would also recommend using Whonix with Qubes.
You can read the documentation: Best wishes,

@_subject: [tor-talk] [GetTor] Simple way of getting Tor countering 
Wayback Machine
I've found a very neat way (which seems to work) for getting Tor in areas/network in which TorProject.org and its mirrors are blocked using the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine (assuming archive.org isn't blocked, which may not be the case for China, but it is for many other countries that block Tor).
One should first save the torproject.org main website using,
Then one should locate the URL of the download page, and save it using,
Then clicking on "Download" button should load the download process and FF says that the download's URL comes from archive.org, in other words one should block archive.org for this method to not work.
 Here's the github page on that: What do you think about this method? Do you have any other suggestions for improving it?
 Happy new year!

Indeed, ideally the Tor Project should launch an official account on the Internet Archive and start relying on archive.org as a means to distribute Tor via GetTor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and Google error / CAPTCHAs. 
Indeed, that error is incredibly annoying. Especially since you happen on it only after you solve the 2 recaptchas. Other major search engines have no problem with Tor, such as:
Bing.com, Yahoo! Search, Ask, Aol

It's still not clear at this point what their motivations are. Also the FAQ should be changed to reflect this:  Specifically this part "To our knowledge, Google is not doing anything intentionally specificallyto deter or block Tor use."
