Can someone tell me which one of these FF plugins leak DNS?
- HostIP.Info GeoLocation Plugin
- Netcraft Toolbar
- Showip
Also, why don't I see the [Warn] entries in tor log about DNS leaks?
What settings to put in what files? Thanks for helping.

This is horrible! I just found wireshark and it is GeoIP.Info
location! The packets showed the contents of my request, even when it
has gone through tor and the source and destination were all correct.
I cannot tell about netcrafttoolbar, nor about showip. Still learning
to use wireshark. Do these two also leak dns?
