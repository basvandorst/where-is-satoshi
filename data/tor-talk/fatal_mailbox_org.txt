@_subject: [tor-talk] Profiling Tor users via keystrokes 
win10 analyses keystrokes by default:
"Windows 10 generates advertising-IDs for everyone. The informations
Win10 transmitts by default are (among other things):
- location of device
- browser history
- favorites
- which Aaps are installed from the windows store
- and data for input-personification. this includes biometrical data of
pronunciation (cortana), writing style (handwirting) and how the user
types on windows devices."
but you can opt-out for many options.

@_subject: [tor-talk] 33c3 and tor? 
an early version of the fahrplan for 33c3 is released¹ (btw. also the
33c3 app on f-droid is already available).
I couldn't find any talks from the tor-project yet, but maybe I've
overlooked them? Will there be any?
And will there be a tor relay operators meetup?

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor phone: Nexus 5X remains black after reboot 
it was supported by copperheados before, but now nexus 5 is EOL (from
googles side) -> no firmware updates anymore -> no secure phone.
if you'd like to have a secure phone, you unfortunatley have to buy a
new one.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Decoding Jake Appelbaum 
I didn't want to contribute to this topic, but Mattia really upset me.
Seriously, have you read the story from River on jacobappelbaum.net?
Or wasn't that rape because they were in a relationship?
However you dress, where ever you go, yes means yes and no means no!
 please do not write about your, truely sad, experiences without
marking such an email with a trigger warning. So that people can decide
beforehand if they'd like to read it. For people who have  been sexually
abused reading your story can be retraumatizing!
