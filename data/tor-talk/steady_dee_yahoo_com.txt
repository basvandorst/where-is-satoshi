@_subject: [tor-talk] Choosing Exit Nodes for Soat Scanner 
Hopefully someone can help here. As a part of some research I'm trying to use the snakes on an exit node scanner (soat.py) to scan against specific exit nodes but I can't get it to work. Soat.py works fine in default mode but if I try to use the --exit parameter it tells me that there are not enough exits available. I also tried different exit nodes and confirmed they were active using torstatus.blutmagie.de. Is there a configuration setting or something I'm missing?
Here is how I am running it:? python soat.py --ssl --target= --exit=78.46.64.75
Here is the last part of the log:

I tried last night using the fingerprint with no luck.

Did you try using the exit node fingerprint with --exit instead of the
ip address?
