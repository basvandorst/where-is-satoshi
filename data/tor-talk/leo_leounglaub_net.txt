@_subject: [tor-talk] HTML5 video and Tor anonymity. 
no, HTML5 videos are not the same as flash videos. The problem with
flash videos is not the video itself, it's a problem because the player
is closed source and you can't control what flash is doing in there.
But with HTML5 videos the browser is the player and so in Firefox,
Chrome, ... its open source. Sience there is no other plugin needed the
browser simply fetches the parts of the video he needs. You can actually
watch that in a tool like Firebug, ... .
Summary: HTML5 videos are no thread to anonymity.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Does TorProject Delay eMail Postings ? 
the torproject propobly uses greylisting for SPAM detection. If your
outgoing SMTP Relay changes alot is simply takes some time to re-send
the email. Thats totaly normal. Emails are not build for real-time

@_subject: [tor-talk] StrictExitNodes deprecated? 
the solution is simple. DONT USE THOSE FUCKED UP SERVICES. Use email
providers that allow an authentication from anywhere like every
provider is supposed to do.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What if I connect to all nsa Tor nodes? 
that depends on your traffic. Sending your data unencrypted into the tor
network is always a problem. Not just on NSA nodes. You have to
distinguish between content encryption, transport encryption and the
tor-connunications-encryption. Those are all different things.
So to make it easy, if you send an encrypted message over an SSL-jabber
chat also encrypted with OTR, it's still relative save.
If you send plain text over jabber you are fucked no matter who operates
the TOR nodes.

@_subject: [tor-talk] development interests 
yes, we are argue about that. Because it is simply stupid to use
outdated software. It is dangerous. And using properitary outdated
software makes it impossible to fix/patch things yourself. He can't even
fix the TCP stack issue from some weeks ago.
Using TOR on properitary Software is always stupid, because you cannot
expect TOR to make you "safe" on the internet if your operating system
is backdoored. (With Windows and OSX are)
So it is a problem for TOR so ship TOR for those platforms because it
tells the user something that it cannot deliver. Of course official TOR
developers would never go that far as say this, but it is what they think.
For example listen to the Q&A from Jacob Applebaum in M?nchen. He talked
a little bit about how hard it is to make TOR secure on Windows and how
much wasted time it is.
If you don't understand software, please stop spamming your comments on
the mailing list.
