Yes, its been a headache -- out of the box; I've had to change passwords
several times on several Gmail accounts. I still can't get this setup to
proxy message: Thunderbird 15.0.1, Ubuntu 12.04, latest Tor bundle.

OK, I should have worded that better, however, I still cannot connect to
Gmail's servers using TorBirdy (v. 0.0.13) default settings. even though
I have confirmed for Gmail that I am the one trying to connect and I via
TorBirdy, and I have changed my passwords several times.
I'm not saying anything is wrong with TorBirdy, it seems I'm the only
one having trouble with this addon; but I haven't made any changes that
would cause a problem.

I forgot to say:
Thunderbird says the connection was refused. Also, I have not been
directed to a captcha.

I forgot, there was:
There's no captcha here, I just click the continue button
and Gmail keeps on refusing my connection until I disable TorBirdy.
