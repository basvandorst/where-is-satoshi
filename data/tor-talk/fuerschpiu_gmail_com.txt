@_subject: [tor-talk] Why not enable 'Mirror Relay Directory' by Default? 
It really sounds silly, but I always asked myself why not all TBB's Mirror the Relay Directory by default. Isn't it possible to detach this option from the basic non-exit Relay in its own option and have it enabled by default?or are there any countries that restrict the use of the default https port?
It uses not much bandwidth, but nonetheless it gives a small constant stream of in's and out's to any Tor user all the time it is running, making it more difficult to determine if any Tor user is actively using TBB or not by any surveyor, in this case the ISP'smostly.
Or would such a thing be contraproductive to any users anonymity?

I only wished that you guys would create some generic WiFi router firmware that would act as a tor relay and entry point. I wouldn't even mind guests on that network then.

So do companies. Your ISP was apparently unhappy with the exit node you had and looked quite far for something to shut it off.
Feel free to change the former exit node to a relay.

Please Mccarron, The discussion is dead. You killed it yourself by not adding anything meaningful as far as I have seen. You just repeat yourself again and again as if it's a mantra. You got statistics to back up your claims? Good - show them! You got the script you used to track the onions? Awesome! Show it so we can see for ourselves and use it too! As others pointed out already: give us something to work with, else you can just pack up and troll another list as far as I am concerned.
