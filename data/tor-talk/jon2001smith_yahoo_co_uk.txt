@_subject: Confused about Tor settings 
I'd installed the vidalia-bundle-0.1.1.23-0.0.7-tiger
and set up Firefox 1.5.0.6 (Mac) exactly as shown
i.e. the first four set to "localhost  Port: 8118",
and SOCKS Host to "localhost  Port: 9050"
This seemed to work according to the recommended test
sites. But then I read somewhere that the "use proxy
server for all protocols" box should be ticked. Which
made no sense to me as that sets SOCKS Host to
Port:8118 anyway. So I installed Torbutton 1.0.4
thinking it'd do it all for me. But that set both the
FTP Proxy and Gopher to " Port: 0". I emailed
the creator of Torbutton who kindly explained that
this is correct as otherwise ftp connections (set to
8118) would fail. I had thought that was supposed to
happen (to prevent DNS leaks...or something). I've
also read that if your browser uses SOCKS 4a you
should use that (instead of the SOCKS v5 setting).
This is hopelessly confusing to me. I've tried to
understand the notes, but can't get my brain around
any of this stuff. Could anyone please confirm/explain
to a moron the exact, correct settings? Or is this
just not for folk like me? ___________________________________________________________ All new Yahoo! Mail "The new Interface is stunning in its simplicity and ease of use." - PC Magazine

Bear with me; you guys are explaining electronics to a
dog here..but aren't some people e.g. Claude, saying
that SOCKS can still leak DNS?  I don't know how to
set Mac Tiger's firewall to block 'Claude's' UDP port
53. I can see the option to block all UDP. But I think
Tiger's firewall is blocking everything on its list
anyway including ftp (although the "use passive ftp
mode" is ticked). Would it be safer re DNS leaks, if
not needing ftp, to use the original configuration and
point ftp and Gopher at Port 8118 and let them fail?
Would that solve the problem of DNS leaks? Or am I
still barking up the wrong tree? :)

I still don't get it. Tor is for anonymity. DNS leaks
compromise anonymity (apparently anyone with 2 brain
cells on nodding terms can figure out where you're
going). The Tor documentation implies, however, the
setting ftp to fail (port 8118) solves this. But I
think people are saying DNS leaks are unavoidable. So
what's the point of Tor(?). Either there is no point or I'm not getting it. But
anyway, it seems to me no average computer user is
going to make sense of all this. And I certainly
can't. So, as they say in the 'Dragons Den' (obscure,
UK cultural reference point)..."I'm out!". :-)
