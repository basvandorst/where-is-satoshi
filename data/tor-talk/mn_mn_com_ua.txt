Check latest news on CentOS and Ubuntu removing Bubblewrap (a sandboxing
tech used by Flatpak) support.
    Warning: Unlike when using a separate user and a separate log-in
    session, bubblewrap not only exposes security vulnerabilities in the
    kernel but also in the window compositor. Users should be aware that
    running untrustworthy code in bubblewrap is still not safe.
