@_subject: [tor-talk] Traffic Spike and who really backs Tor 
is on reddit/technology... "Tor Project is mostly funded by the Department of Defense".
Is it really an Non-Government Organization (NGO) backing Tor?  Why are they not named?!  Any idea what's going on with the overnight traffic spike?  I am worried the Tor network could be vulnerable to Man in the middle attacks if those users are not legit ones...

Thanks for sharing, Collin.  Those graphs are very interesting.  What the hell is going on???

Hi Mike,
Embarrassingly, I went straight to the most romantic hypothesis and then worked my way back elsewhere, IRC and Twitter. A few of these prospects could be reasonably addressed through the trends of the top fifty countries, illustrated here: Few other points of conjecture that came up:
   - I would infer based on no increase occurring in Iran that the Tor
   version being run by the agent is pre-2.4; Iran continues to implement
   countrywide DPI against Tor's SSL handshake, which was fixed for the moment
   in ticket  Whether it's circumvention or malware, I would trust it
   would hit Iran.
   - As Runa notes, attempting to correlate with censorship is not strong,
   I would propose however that based on relative growth, a better indicator
   is level of development (ehem, piracy) and geography. I might be passing
   over someone, but it isn't until you get to Japan (40th) that you run into
   what is traditionally called a highly-developed state (all apologies for
   the terrible phrasing of this).
   - Pirate Browser with Tor was released when, August 11th or 12th? I
   would expect we would see a more gradual and less synchronous incline if it
   were natural adoption patterns (short of an autoupdater).
  A) The change in user counts for each country should be proportional
I would also look for piracy and software update rates.
I culled the list at 1,000 users on either dates, there were a few countries that cropped up with new users, like Anguilla. Macedonia and Bosnia are also interesting toward this, regionally and going from a hundred to a thousand.
Look for Muslim countries in the chart.
It's not.
Like, Hack the planet, bro.
So I think we are left with one unfortunate, not Israeli conclusion. Is there an example of such fine grain statistics of botnet growth tagged with date and country? Seems like a pretty solid research dataset for someone.
