I know of a case where a friend of my got smtor/smtpovertor to work with hotmail and mozillas email client , or kind of, the client would send a email to an SMTP server and that then recoded it and forwarded it to the smtor/smtpovertor server so it useages a normal SMTP server as gateway .

Hidemyass did deanonymize and gave out information to the goverment about One if their own users. If dns is your problem run dns throw Tor. Use dnscrypt throw Tor . A cpanel is often just some php script sure it might record ur ip and useragent But that is mostly the Web server that does that. If You have a fake usr agent and are running Tor You can do like a online browser leakage test. I would not(and this is my opinion use hidemyass).

Some vpn providers provide logless vpn which is the best ofc , but yeah u need a non US provider and some u trust Oskar Wendel  skrev: (24 januari 2016 12:48:57 CET)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor honeypot 
Hi *:)
I have been playing around with some telnet and ssh honeypots lately and caught some malware to learn More about reverse Engineering. And i thought it would be cool to run a Tor honeypot , something that listens on port 9001 and is ofc not connected to the Tor Network.
 So something that listens on port 9001 and logs all incoming request just to see if there is anything scanning for Tor ports and trying to hack them, has this been done? Would be cool to look at the data from that if anyone got a link. I cant be able to find something like this online:/
Take care

So i have been running a vps in the Netherlands for around 2years now and lately i have been seeing some kind of dpi system/censor ship being build , with other words they are starting to block sites so i cant curl them. I havent been able to find any online research or some article about censorship in the Netherlands, have anyone looked at deep package inspection systems or simular in the Netherlands?
It might just be the isp who has started to block some sites. But this has never happend to Me before when i use a vps in the Netherlands. If anyone got some paper about censorship in the Netherlands let Me know:)

Seems like the usual stuff when I was working on my obfusication project(layerprox) I added dummy traffic generation to avoid correlation attacks. But what's wrong is that people will download the entire lists of ips of all nodes and blacklist them /add them in snort/bluecoat-squidproxy conf.

Hey , you should tell why it's so great to run a hiddenservice rather then to run a website on the regular ipv4/6 . Also you should talk about the DHT and how to is being used a fun thing could be the dpi bypassing that it does and how the portable transports work FTE etc ..
