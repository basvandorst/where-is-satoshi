@_subject: TLS Error on Mac OS X 10.5 
I'm running a fully patched Mac OS X 10.5 machine and I'm getting the "TLS Error: unexpected close..." message from TOR.
I've tried both the current stable easy-bundle (vidalia-bundle-0.2.1.22-0.2.6) & the experimental version (vidalia-bundle-0.2.2.7-alpha-0.2.6) Both give the same error.
I understand that this is due to the SSL renegotiation bug/fix. Is there any timescale for the Tor/Vidalia Mac bundle to get a fix/work around ?
