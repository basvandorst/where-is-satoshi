@_subject: Tor appliance 
I've considered this option also on my WRT54GL flashed with DD-WRT if  it would work and be able to process the encryption fast enough  without overclocking the router.
I've also considered setting up a linux box as a firewall with either  IPCop, Astaro, or Smoothwall. Does anyone have experience with these  or another OS as a firewall appliance? My primary goal is not only  security but to control/monitor QoS and total amount of bandwidth  used. Even though I have a 24Mbit/s connection with high bandwidth  allowance, I need to use some of it also!

Actually the moral of the story would be to surf using Lynx w/SSL from a Linux or BSD Tor enabled LiveCD.  Unfortunately you won't see any pictures or movies so that will eliminate most users who use Tor for "private" surfing.  ;-)
Or you could get REALLY secure and just unplug the computers from the net and go outside for some fresh air and get a life!

Or like saying "Because SOME people are using Tor for bad things, we  need to get rid of Tor."
