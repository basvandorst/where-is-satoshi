Another country, no. Other countries yes :) It's 91k more users, minus total losses from
other countries which should add up to it. For example the US lost about 20k, Brazil 7k, ...
But I expect it to appear soon.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Guard selection impact on anonymity for bridge users 
I see that guard selection is a very important criteria for ensuring anonymity with Tor. But I've never seen it being discussed in the context of bridge users who usually have to input those bridges manually.
I have a couple of questions:
o The recommended behavior is to take the 3 or 2 bridge lines from BridgeDB and STICK WITH THEM (not rotating them) if they work for as long as possible? If so why aren't there any warning against rotating them for no reason for bridge users?
o If someone has 3 different laptops, they should use the same bridge lines across all of them instead of using different bridge lines for each one, right? (I know that Tor would pick different guards for each one, but since bridge selection is manual, it leaves this option for the user)
o This one is a bit different: Since bridge users are much less than direct users (nearly 1 bridge user for each 40 direct users) and since the density of users per bridge relays is much less than the density of users per guard relays, wouldn't that make traffic correlation harder for direct users than bridge users?

I have some questions about the coming switch to next-gen onion services:
o What will happen to current onion services? Will they all be simply discontinued or will there be a process by which they will be automatically built again to form next-gen onions?
o What will happen to all the relays that are running versions of Tor that don't support next-gen onion services?
Thx --Jeff

Thank you so much David for your answers, that is very nice from you.

The current services will still function for a while before we actually remove
the support from tor. And that "while" will be few years at least. Both
versions will live in parallel so you'll be able to have current service and
next-gen service on the same tor instance.
Currently, we do not plan to have an automatic transition to a next-gen
address so if you want to create a next-gen address for your service, you'll
have to simply configure a second service in the torrc indicating that you
want the new version. We'll be documenting that process upon release.
Good question. Onion services need basically three different type of relays,
HSDir (directory), Intro point (IP) and Rendezvous Point (RP).
The tor 0.3.0 release has the next-gen support for HSDir and IP. For the RP,
the all current relays will work with next-gen. And for IP, next-gen services
have a legacy option to use old IPs (<= 0.2.9). It has been put there for this
transition period where we expect to have unfortunately a lot more tor out
there that don't support next-gen.
What is left is the HSDir that will have to be selected based on the protocol
version advertised by the relay. So at first, there might be very few of those
so there will be a period of time before we reached what we call "network
maturity" which will allow us to switch from the current service protocol to
the next-gen for all newly created services.
This post on tor-dev@ kind of explain our intentions (but that might change
overtime of course):

@_subject: [tor-talk] Finally a Cloudflare captchas workaround thanks to 
One of the possible solutions that was mentioned earlier concerning Cloudflare captchas was generation .onion automatically for sites on Cloudflare to make things easier all round. However Cloudflare's CEO didn't want such solution because "weak hash used by .onion means theoretical risk you can create collision on two addresses." [
Now that coming next-gen onion services will use stronger crypto that would eradicate the problem above, does that mean that we will finally see a workaround to Cloudflare's captchas?

to Google"s search service are being treated by Google as

Work-around that I found to be somewhat acceptable:
1. Set high security setting,
2. Go to ipv4.google.com
3. search, captcha that will show up should be just text, and easier.
This would've been easier if there was a NoScript blacklist where JS
is always disabled, instead of constantly switching between security

@_subject: [tor-talk] Possible solution to next-gen onion services UX disaster 
I just thought about a possible (partial) solution to solve the "UX disaster" of next-gen onion services, namely the very long addresses. Tor Browser already ships with HTTPS
Everywhere, and one can easily write rules that redirect from http or https to onion services, as an example,
If there was a possibility to add all the famous and most used onion services (facebook
for example) into those rules then that effectively solves the UX problem for most of these
onion services, since the user will no longer have to bother about finding the right onion
What do you think?

@_subject: [tor-talk] A Pluggable Transport based on i2p? 
Could it be possible to implement a pluggable transport using i2p? The way this could work
is that a server would function as a bridge node, and will also have the i2p router installed,
and the client will connect to this bridge via I2P Tunnels,
What do you think?

an anonymization network. This idea seems pretty stupid to me.
That setup was not about hiding the fact that one uses Tor, I can think of three or four
o Getting around Tor censorship when your government doesn't censor the i2p network (which
is arguably more difficult to censor than vanilla Tor). There was a thread on forum.i2p on
the status of i2p censorship in the world, and apparently it's still not blocked by governments
that tried to/blocked Tor.
o Taking advantage of the security of both networks, so if the Tor network is theoretically
pwned one is still safe because of i2p, and if i2p is pwned one is still safe.
o Hiding the fact that you're using Tor and i2p, with such setup one can only learn that
you're using i2p (the opposite can't be *completely* made, since Tor doesn't support UDP
one can only use TCP with a Tor->i2p setup).
o Making traffic correlation attacks harder (?).

and it's currently only implemented in Java, which is not exactly a good basis
for a pluggable transport.
There's a C++ implementation of i2p called i2pd:

transport would be that censors would have more incentive to censor
i2p connections.
I think that's a very important point, especially since the i2p team doesn't have enough
funding, and censorship resistance is not their highest priority at the moment.
right now are hard or easy to DPI for.
Me neither, but I do know from their roadmap that they're working on integrating obfs4 to
i2p as a plugin to work as a pluggable transport which should at least make it harder for
DPIs to detect (see 0.9.3.0 )
