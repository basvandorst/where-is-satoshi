The MPAA still has to prove you realy have the content which they claim you
downloaded stored on your computer or any other storage device afaik.

@_subject: Why you need balls of steel to operate a Tor exit node 
And these treats are rapidly growing throughout western countries, i also
stopped running an exit node now, guess being relay is all there is left to
do now.
I started supporting FreeNet now since it is only an internal network there
wont be external traffic thats logged or considered illegal anywhere.
