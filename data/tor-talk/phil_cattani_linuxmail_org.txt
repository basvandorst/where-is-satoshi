@_subject: Bash script for tor server configuration 
Hi there.  I'm new to this group.  I have a written a Bash script
which prompts the user through a series of questions and outputs
the appropriate tor server configuration (torrc) file - actually,
only the second half (server half) of the file.
So far there is no data input validation, and only the basic settings,
plus two options have been implemented.
This is the first draft.  Subsequent versions may have more features,
data input validations, and possibly configure tor itself using the
tor configuration interface.
Would it be alright if I copied and pasted the script into this group
so people could have a look and make any suggestions?

Ok, here is the code.
Persistent for one month.
Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.  If anyone else would like
to help out with coding, that would also be great.
