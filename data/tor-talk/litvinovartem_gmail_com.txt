@_subject: Using Tor with Thunderbird: problem with Gmail SMTP server 
I have a problem with sending my mail through Gmail SMTP server, using
Thunderbird 1.5.0.8 under Linux. The mail is not sent when Tor is enabled.
I read here
that I need to exclude the IP of SMTP server from being proxied.
But I do not know how to do that.
Please explain it to me in a simple fashion, if you know.
Here follows in details what I do:
Yes, I did that. Tor is enabled.
I cannot find it! There is not a word about SMTP servers in this dialog box.
Yes, I use the same server for sending and receiving mail
(smtp.gmail.com and pop.gmail.com).
IP address of smtp.gmail.com is 64.233.167.111 (I got it by ping)
How to exclude this IP from being proxied? Where is it done?
Please give detailed and simple instructions if possible.

Well, it is an option. Thanks.
But still I would like to hear how to do it normal way, using  mail client (Thunderbird in my case).

Thank you very much, friend!
It works now with the settings you mentioned above.
But strangely enough, now it is working with old settings, suggested in Gmail help for Thunderbird, namely: TLS, Port 587.
Ok, the problem is resolved, anyway.
