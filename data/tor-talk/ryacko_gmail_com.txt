Pretty sure there's be more collisions in regard to those yes or not
questions than you think. Distribution of temperaments and opinions seem to
fit a bell curve. Thus the number of collisions would be quite high.
In terms of internet plug-ins, a person would customize their computer in
terms of how well they understand computers. Thus the low-end would have
malware and the high end would have unique plug-ins, programs, and fonts
that serve their interests.

While my analogy and definition of security may not have been best
suited, nor is this reply, the point remains that there is nothing
special here for you as a corp. Anything you say that LE can provide
for *you* with honeypots can also be sourced internally or from the
open market and your subsequent call to LE to mop up upon discovery
of badness therein.
Revolutionary concept... but businesses could work together on their own
initiative. It's how inter-bank checking began.

They claim that it's security first, CDN second.

Why is there no multicore support for Tor? I haven't been able to find an

The price of a public dedicated ip address is at worst, $20 a month.
Two tor nodes max per IP address, so roughly $20*6000 relays / 2 =
$60,000 per year.
That is perhaps the only price of no multicore support.
Although, many Tor nodes are hosted using dynamic IPs, so perhaps the
cost is closer to $1,000 per year.
In any case, I'm not sure how many sequential operations there are.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What's to be Done 
I'm somewhat excited for new developments in the internet of things.
The development of a $9 computer means that while for a long time one
could achieve government grade cryptographic security, it isn't until
recently that you could achieve the duplication of computers to ensure
segregation and security (on a reasonable budget). The recent
malvertising attack stealing any files named "pass" or "passw*" shows
that security can only be done by doing things by hand.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Suggestion, hard-coded related domains 
Many websites operate their own CDN. Under the current Tor system each
unique domain name is routed to an exit node. The obvious problem is that
this provides another angle of attack for deanonymizing users if there are
multiple domains controlled by a single party.

That would still leak additional information, to a lesser extent.
Regardless, I don't think the TOR network has the bandwidth or
computational capacity for padding. It'd require more bookkeeping.
How is it that Tor doesn't provide multicore support yet anyway?

Go to The Attritionist Letters (
My tour continued at an infantry regiment combat operations center (COC).
We flew in at night, guided by the tactical support wide area network with
the red flashing light that could be seen from miles away. Urban sprawl
emerged from the desert floor. There were cavernous UOC tents with
airconditioning so cold that fleeces and watchcaps were the personal
protective equipment of choice; not a flack jacket or Kevlar was to be
found. The COC was alive with command post of the future (CPOF), command
and control personal computers, and the common operating picture; charts
and laminated matrices hung so neatly from the UOC walls. With two maneuver
battalions in the midst of simultaneous attacks up their respective
corridors, all seemed to be going well. Suddenly, a dust storm blew up and
threatened the very UOC that represented the regiment?s command and
control. Walls flew open, papers and mission cards were strewn about, and
soon enough the UOC itself was blown over exposing the entrails to the
mercy of the wind. Marines sullenly grabbed broken and bent bars from the
crumpled UOC as if they had not a purpose except to mourn the loss of their
command and control fortress. I witnessed a foolish young lieutenant try to
convince the Marines (both senior and junior) to leave the UOC alone and
?get the radio nets back up? in order to continue monitoring the fight. The
fool! Does he not realize that the CPOF and the UOC are the true
manifestations of command and control, not simple communications with the
maneuver battalions? How can we have a regimental commander coordinate the
fight from a vehicle and a radio? Perhaps a decade ago, but no longer
Command and control is now only attainable by ?stuff? like command and
control systems, big intimidating tents, air-conditioning, plasma screens,
and video teleconferencing. The poor lieutenant . . . he has no future in
our Corps!

It just simply doesn't matter.
To have a modern lifestyle, depends upon having devices of dubious or poor
security. The government has shown a willingness to accumulate dossiers
(seemingly including IRC chats), and then leak them when it serves their
own needs.
Our Congress is criminally incompetent. The chairman of the House Oversight
committee just had his secret service application leaked, and there is no
threat of the the most powerful tools that Congress has: appropriations
micromanagement (famously done in Congressional reconstruction) or
impeachment. The same goes for Benghazi (which probably was a meeting with
a rebel group that went sour). I think our government is more malicious and
less competent than Hoover's FBI.
For comparison:
?Another early Bureau practice was to index names on lists when the list
reflected possible association with a subversive group (e.g. Communist
Party petitions or subscriptions to the Daily People's World), or where the
names might have future reference value (American Legion contacts, loyalty
forms). The heavy demands on staff time and resources, however, and the
absence of substantial information about the individuals whose names
appeared in the this context caused the Bureau to limit indexing in these
areas. In 1949 the Executive Conference decided that names on Communist
Party petitions and subscription lists to the Daily Worker and Daily
People's World be indexed in the appropriate field office only.?

1. "Tor does provide a partial solution in a very specific situation,
though. When you make a connection to a destination that also runs a
Tor relay, Tor will automatically extend your circuit so you exit from
that circuit. So for example if Indymedia ran a Tor relay on the same
IP address as their website, people using Tor to get to the Indymedia
website would automatically exit from their Tor relay, thus getting
*better* encryption and authentication properties than just browsing
there the normal way."
I'm not sure if this still holds true, and it's not apparent it is
used when looking at the "Tor circuit for this site" column of the Tor
2. I think the fingerprint is outdated.

This is apparently available for an academic price of around two
thousand dollars.
A google search hasn't revealed much talk on the tor lists about FPGAs for Tor.
Such cards will probably have to be used in the near future, at least
to reduce bandwidth costs per gigabit/s speed.
I imagine infrequent operations and operations likely to be changed
between Tor versions could be offloaded to the CPU.

I find it hard to believe that you cannot make use of any informal

People do not exist in isolation, and this meme that no private sector
individual has knowledge on Tor ignores that Tor's often outdated
