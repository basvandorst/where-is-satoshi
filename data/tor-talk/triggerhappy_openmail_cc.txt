@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB and tor-relays as a bitcoin wallets 
Hash: SHA512
Hi all,
Just an idea. In theory : is it possible to implement bitcoin wallet
into tor-relay and TBB 1) ? TBB users could tip tor-relays (f.e. 1
satoshi for guard and middle relay,  3 satoshi for exit-node per
circuit). Running tor-relays could be profitable or at least cheaper.
1).I think Cody Wilson is working on a bitcoin wallet in a browser.

Hash: SHA512
I'm running a relay on vps and i saw today strange notice in Arm :
"Read the last day of bandwidth history from state file (28 minutes
are missing". I'm also flagged as "Unnamed" but i see name of my node
on Atlas or at blutmagie.de. My bandwidth is also much higher than
detected (avg. 1,1Mb/sec vs. 70KB/s)
