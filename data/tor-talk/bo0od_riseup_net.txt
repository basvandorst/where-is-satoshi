@_subject: [tor-talk] You Can Now Watch YouTube Videos with Onion Hidden 
Im not the operator of the service but here are the advantages:
- Youtube is made by a dick company to humanity called Google, which is
funding their services by stealing/collecting users data. So the JS
which is closed source in case of YB prevent you from watching the
videos unless you allow the JS. in case of invidous the JS used already
licensed and the source code you can find it here:
Plus you can watch the videos without the need to allow any JS.
- Connecting to Youtube directly , then you are putting your security on
the SSL/TLS encryption. Whereas using in invidous hidden services your
security is through the Onion hidden services design more you can watch
Roger Dingledine speech at defcon:
or just normal youtube link if you like
- Its free software and the code is available for install/checkup. You
are referring to FB which is completely the opposite of anything
mentioned here.
Hope that clarify the differences.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Most Security Assertions Dangerous [Re: YouTube via 
One simple line: how is that related to be bad for invidious ?
- You talked about JS been bad (agreed), but its unrelated/invalid to
invidious case. Protonmail cant operate/login without the JS and most
likely their JS is closed source but that has nothing to do with invidous
- You mentioned repos and bsd ..etc this has nothing to do with user
security while they are browsing invidous case.
- You mentioned the connection unclean , well hey the guy just started
the mirror yesterday give a chance. plus its free software do support
him in github to make this better place.
- You mentioned youtube-dl and similar services , well these firstly has
different goals than another safe front end to YB in our case with
invidous. Also Invidous onion by design it has Onion hidden services
security , whereas with youtube-dl downloading from youtube this isnt
valid case (no onion hidden services implementation).
So in short , instead of warning the ppl about something which has no
meanings on reality, go and help to make invidous (or any similar
service) better place for security and privacy for the end user.
Thank You :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] comparison of Tor and Kovri in regards to 
I2P and Tor comparison:
Kovri and I2Pd C++ bloody war:
I2P by design safer than Tor. but due to the usage and rapid development
of Tor , I2P left behind many steps which needs long time to catch up or
sudden magic stick effect.
I would summaries the success of Tor over I2P with these points:
- Tor is way faster than I2P in the few past years (because I2P support
torrenting , so the speed is slow).
- Due to the slow speed of I2P , its very unlikely you can stream or do
heavy connections on the clearnet. Tor you can do it with even up to 1MB
- I2P meant to be for inproxy which is in other word it wont target/suit
the average user. Tor is suiting the average users due to its high speed
bandwidth and its ease interacting with the outproxy/clearnet.
- Tor has a modified browser which is a fork of firefox-esr called Tor
Browser Bundle which is easy to click and run with Tor. I2P until now
there is no official browser supporting it and user needs to do the
configurations manually.
- Tor programmed in C which gives it the opportunity to run on small
resources like home routers. I2P is programmed in Java which needs
resources and cant be functioning well on very small resources.
Hope that answered your question :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] onion balance needed by default 
I see that from a safe hosting perspective to Tor Hidden services, That
Tor should maintain and ship onion balance by default.
Which is sadly last ever maintained before more than 1 year or so, and
also it lacks the support of onion v3.
This is really useful and needed for cheep/safe hosting of a hidden
service at home or any small server.
as VPS not really always wise to host a hidden service + not much safe
and trusted who accept btc and accept onion hidden service in their
servers at the same time.
so i prefer self hosted with latest Tor upgrade (onion v3) , but sadly
not possible atm with a DOS protection.
so i hope Tor take care of that and consider it as a core software for
now and the future.
Thank You!

* “sudo apt-get install hardened-debian-cli” will be possible on bare
metal Debian hosts, in other words installations of Debian can be easily
converted into Hardened Debian by installing the hardened-debian-cli or
other hardened debian package
* maybe later available as ISO for installation on hardware depending on
community interest and support
=== hardening by default in Hardened Debian version 1 ===
* install haveged by default for better entropy
* sdwdate ( rather than insecure NTP
* security-misc ( - (deactivates
previews in Dolphin; deactivates previews
in Nautilus; deactivates TCP timestamps; deactivates Netfilter’s
connection tracking helper;)
* open-link-confirmation

* better kernel version
=== usability by default ===
*  2

- initially will be available most likely for:
* CLI only (console only, no desktop environment)
* KDE
- Later on likely for:
* XFCE
=== vision ===
* computer security community is larger than computer anonymity
community - we can work on a shared interest that is security
* we apply as many security settings by default
* we apply as much as default from
* Hardened Debian will be the base for Whonix - Anonymous Operating
System ( Whonix is
applying most of above already anyhow)
=== development status of version 1 ===
* approximately 50% done
* meta package "hardened-debian-kde" and "hardened-debian-cli" exist -
* most packages working (since reused from Whonix)
* build script ready (--flavor hardened-debian-kde / --hardened-debian-cli)

About whonix not necessarily virtualbox, actually its better to use KVM or Qubes/Xen OS.
And virtualization is better than containers, plus docker update mechanism just security sucks.
if you know about sysadmin and know how to use things for anonymity (e.g avoid leaky stuff like apache and use instead nginx and so on...) reading the source and playing with it and stuff like that is something extra not mandatory to maintain secure hidden services.

- Whonix if you want to use the OS on Virtual Machine like Qubes/xen (best option) or KVM or Virtualbox <- If you want to host hidden service this is the best option as well.
Without blinking an eye you must choose GNU operating system, Windows and Mac OSs are just malware.
And the more you read the more you are safe, to start with reading go to each project documentation and start from there e.g Tor,Whonix,Tails...etc
As a distro to choose use GNU/Linux Mint (easy) or Debian (medium) or Qubes (hard)

no matter how many time you upgrade TB it wont upgrade (which is rational because there is no space). But a notification telling the user that would be better.

I doubt excludenodes does any good, as tpo stated the behavior of how Tor will react to it is not studied well and might be disabled in the future. Aside from that just because too many nodes puppet up or you feel suspecious doesnt necessary be worse than any old trusted node located within spying countries like US or UK or Germany..etc or even anywhere. What im trying to say is we need permanent design mitigation to solve that not temporary blockage of x or y then another a and b will pop up and the game continues forever...
