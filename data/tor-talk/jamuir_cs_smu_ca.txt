Some time ago, I conducted several tests that demonstrated that Java Applets have the ability to disregard proxy settings in the Java Control and open direct non-proxied connections.  I do not think what you have described will work.

When I read that example it seems to indicate that the applet reads your IP address locally and then submits it back to the originating web site through the proxy.  The applet does not seem to ignore proxy settings (i.e. it does not seem to open a non-proxied connnection); it just submits identifying information through the proxied connection.
Jacob, Steve: I don't want to publish my complete ready-to-run code on the list, but here is an excerpt:
Socket socket_to_originating_host = null;
int tcp_port = 80;
InetSocketAddress originating_host =
   new InetSocketAddress(getCodeBase().getHost(), tcp_port);
try {
       socket_to_originating_host = new Socket(Proxy.NO_PROXY);
       // timeout is in milliseconds
       socket_to_originating_host.connect(originating_host, 10000);
       System.out.println(
        "Socket Local Address = " +
        socket_to_originating_host.getLocalAddress().getHostAddress());
catch (Exception e) {
       System.out.println("EXCEPTION THROWN:  " + e);
       System.exit(1);

@_subject: is Java unsafe to use with Tor? 
Java is not safe to use with Tor, or any other proxy-based anonymity system.  It is possible for applets to override any proxy settings you might have set (i.e. an applet running in your browser can disregard your proxy settings and make a direct connection to the internet).  For an example of this, you can have a look my paper "Internet Geolocation and Evasion".
I have heard that it is possible to run your browser and JavaVM (and Flash and JavaScript, if you want) inside a larger virtual machine. This is what JanusVM does.  If you really want to use Java with Tor, then you could try that.
