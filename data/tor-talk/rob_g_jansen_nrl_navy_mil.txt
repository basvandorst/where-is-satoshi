In addition to what Sebastian mentioned above, Tor nodes will drop and
ignore circuits that take too long to build. Check the following config

That is definitely an error! I rebooted the nodes but it appears that their consensus weights in the latest consensus have not been corrected. So I just took them down now.
Is not a bug; we were investigating a way to more quickly stabilize to an accurate weight. Obviously, we misconfigured that process. Sorry about that!
I think at this point I should go back to a stable release and maybe generate new keys to avoid this mistake again.
All the best,

The bwauths were not involved. My relays were reporting high bandwidths, and I believe that Torflow must combine those reported values with their measurements to come up with a final value. I guess they should be using some sort of bandwidth cap for the self reports to prevent this, but they must not be.
More about the issue can be tracked on the open ticket:
All the best,
