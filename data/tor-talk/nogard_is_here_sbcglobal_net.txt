@_subject: Tor problems with Proxomiton and privoxy 
I have tor set up with proxomiton and privoxy. Every time I try to connect to a site, I get a message in the tor window that says, "[notice] tried for 60 seconds to get connection to [scrubbed]:80.Giving up." How can I fix this? I'm using tor version 0.1.0.16
