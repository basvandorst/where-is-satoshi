@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and browser lock 
AFAIK, anti-piracy companies fish for IP addresses via BitTorrent, than send notices to internet providers responsible for those IP addresses. Because Tor is a proxy, they will send notices to internet providers catering to exit nodes. If an exit node does not browse the Web (I am confident that they don't), it'll be fine.

My little story. Facebook banned me after a month of use. I never logged in via Tor. I was not told the reason for the ban. I guess it's because I didn't use my real name. Anyhow, thank you for providing us your Onion website! :-)
The thing is that Tor is bad for circumventing censorship because Tor is not a masked proxy. Guess what will happen when Facebook rulers realize

Great news! Beware that when a bridge's address becomes known to many people, it becomes known to censors. So it's better to give the address only to trusted people.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Does Tor support ControlSocket? 
Hi. Some old discussions on "stem" and "vidalia" suggest that Tor may be controlled via a Unix domain socket. This seems like a good way to control Tor on Unix; I just need to add a user who will control Tor to the "tor" group. But I can't find anything like a documentation.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Does Tor support ControlSocket? 
Permissions on directory /var/run/tor are too permissive.
Before Tor can create a control socket in "/var/run/tor/control", the directory "/var/run/tor" needs to exist, and to be accessible only by the user account that is running Tor.
Why are not permissions 0770 allowed?

A magic wand is a solution. :-)
Though I don't understand your protocol, I don't like id at site names. That site belongs to a corporation, so I depend on a corporation which I can't control. There is a more fundamental problem with human readable names. There is competition for nice names like "sex" or "casino", for example, in the domain of domain names. This competition is resolved with auctions. So a human readable name is paid, and its owner depends on the registrar.Public key fingerprints are a solution to both problems.

Exactly. Bugs in software. Or, as Dijkstra put it, incorrect software. Users demand more features instead of more correctness because buggy software is "good enough" and a rare glitch is no problem. Then they discover that they lost control of their computers.

@_subject: [tor-talk] webmail send while using TOR is tagged as spamends 
I see that roughly 10% of messages from tor-talk at lists.torproject.org from different people go into Gmail's spam folder. If you send a message via Yahoo's webmail, the message is sent from Yahoo's server, not from Tor. So it's not likely that using Tor is relevant in your case.
This message has not gone into the spam folder.
No spam filter is perfect. My advice: do something useful, dude, instead of suing people providing you a service for free.
Privacy is a broad term. I guess privacy means anonymity here. Then your anonymity conflicts with my desire to throw away spam. How can I know whether a message is a spam without reading it? One method is when an algorithm reads the message. This method is employed in many mail services. It is not perfect, as you see. Another method is when I read only messages digitally signed and from people which I trust. This method is more powerful than the previous and requires senders to reveal their identity. You see now?
I *intentionally* use Gmail spam filter despite being able not to use it. Because 95% of messages in the spam folder are real spam. Because few people sign digitally their messages.
At least, a mail service of a paid web hoster allows you to turn off spam filtering.

The same applies if you replace "a HTTP website" with "a social network account where you advertise the Onion website."
