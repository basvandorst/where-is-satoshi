@_subject: [tor-talk] A community concern that needs to be addressed, 
I actually had to stopped using the  browser as it is not accessible for mac, at least under voiceover. When you launch it you hear tor has no windows. A command l does not hep and I could not see any menu bars. So although tor is getting better it has a long long way to go.
Blessings and happy Friday

Hello to all. Sadly I have to shut down my tor relay after less then 24 hours, as I received a copyright violation and I don't want any network restrictions  placed on me as I want the 150mbps speed.
Sorry to all who were using it, but yeah there it is.

Well I'm no coder. How do I then do this? I'm going to start over from scratch, maybe. I dont' know much about the exit policies as I'm quite new to this tor thing lol! I wonder what is trigering this to happen on our vps's, at least o my vps. Lol!

Ok, I modified it. We'll see what happens I guess. Bleh I have to start over with the tor cycle. Oh well, it's all a lyearning process. Eh?

Yeah, the exit policy you gave me essentially does that. We'll see. Is there anyware I can look  in /var/log/tor/log for me to keep an eye on things? I I'm not good at log diving, but I've had to do my share.
Blessings and happy Sunday

Yeah I used debian for this I did issue a sudo service tor reload. And all worked as expected according to the log anyway.

Well I could be nasty and reject port 443 and 80, but  that's like chopping off someone's head when they have a headache. I believe i added those ports as excepts. I can't remember now.

Actually, no ip complained.  It was the VPS I am hosting this thign on. I'll keep an eye on logs I gguess when I have the time.

Nah I'll just wait to see if I get any more complaints. I think it was torrent stuff using it.  I have receed nothinge else from them so far and I assume that the problem has ben resolved. I guess I could go log diving if I'm wanting something to do. Lol!

No, the DMCA was not specific. That's all they told me was that copyright material were going through the vps and  I was breaking the TOS.

No they did not as you saw in the excerpt I posted. I told them now all is well with out going into detail. I had 24 hours to send them an all clear or they would restrict my network bandwidth and I want the gigabit connection for all the services I run on my vps. So it has ben up and running I believe since Sunday now, or was it Monday. Now I wait for the full cycle to take effect and hope someone can use the 50mbps bandwidth I set up. Hopefully the network will be a lot faster as I'm not actually using that but for icecast and some streaming services.

Keeping an eye on things. Support asked me how I would prevent the copyright material from being accessed or even gotten to on the server. I gave them something about firewalls and keeping an eye on ports and blocking unnecessary ones. They will close the case after 48 hours of no complaints. This as of Friday so we'll see.
Thanks all.

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor accessibility for mac and voiceover users 
Hello there. I'm very new to tor. I was going to use it to visit a site my provider blocked. I live in the us but they think that my downloading from a site for the blind for some reason is  harmful. I dunno. Anyway I went to launch tor after installing it and voiceover, the screen reader that ships with mac os10.4 and higher said that it has no windows. I can't do anything with the app. I challenge anyone on the mac to try to use the tor browser without making use of the monitor and using the keyboard only, not the mouse. You will see what I mean. If you are on windows test it with nvda found at nvda-project.org.
Should you have any questions  re accessibility, I'd be happy to answer them.
Blessings and happy Thursday

@_subject: [tor-talk] doing a google search creates a 403 forbidden when I'm 
Hello to all. I was just on the tor network and launched google to do a google search. I got a 403 forbidden when trying to search for something. I know this might not be fixable, but Can this at least be noted somewhere? Here is the contents of the error.
403. That?s an error.
Your client does not have permission to get URL /sorry/IndexRedirect?continue= from this server.  That?s all we know.
I dunno if this will help, as that's all I know at this time. I didn't know tor blocked google searches.
Take care and have a happy Sunday to all.

I'm no lawyer, I'll let someone else deal with this. But I thought I'd let someone on the list who  might be better at letter writing than I know.

Given that I use google on a daily bases and have that set as my home page in safari  I kind of right now don't want to set my home page. I'm using the terminal version of tor to connect and link up safari not the browser. I can't as it's not accessible to me using voiceover on mac osx. It works though. I can always do my searches when I get out of tor assuming I remember to exit out when I'm done that is. Lol!

@_subject: [tor-talk] doing a google search creates a 403 forbidden when 
I can try it out, but if it is not accessible to me using voiceover that won't work at all.
I'll look into it later. Right now I'm trying to write some documentation on something I'm designing, and I just came up for air for a bit.

Oh good, I'm not theeonly one seeing the error then. Well I guess I will have to not do my google searches when using the tor network then I guess. I use the proxi method of tor so yeah glad it fails to on the tor browser. Well, nt glad, but glad I'm not feeling like I'm going crazy.

Well I found what I was looking for for someone when I got off the tor proxi. It was a link to mp3 gain they needed for mac. And that's what I was doing a google search for at the time.

Actually this is why I'm using tor. They are throttling my bandwidth that comes from a site for the blind to nothing. I can browse but that's about it.  I can't dl from there. But with tor and my cellphone tethered to my laptop I can. Also if I bypass my isp and use tor as a proxy such as I'm doing now, I can do fine from that site. They unban my ip for a few items, then ban it when I dl a few more items. This has ben going on for a few month now and I just ignore it even though I know very well it is a net neutrality violation. Oh well, I'm good for now.

Oh, I'd donate a relay, however I really don't feel like logging onto my virtual private server, spinning another one up only to have it compromised in some odd way.
Good job on the network guys. Keep it up.
