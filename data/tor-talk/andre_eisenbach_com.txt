@_subject: Tor service monitoring util available? 
Most of the things you've described can be done with existing tools like MRTG, or RRDTOOL. Especially the Tor unrelated things (CPU usage etc) can be done with existing monitoring tools. Tor can be easily integrated into MRTG etc. to add the Tor specific information.
Having said that, I did write a small windows application which uses the Tor control protocol to monitor the bandwith on the Tor server, and it could be easily expanded to provide more information. I just need to find the time :D.
I've also toyed with the idea of providing a PHP interface which can be used to make a server monitoring web site.
I'll post stuff as I get around to it...
