@_subject: [tor-talk] vidalia bundle & TBB updates 
As far as im aware I continue to receive regular updates from the torproject
PPA for tor
In windows why have updates for the vidalia bundle halted and only updated
with the TBB ?
Im not sure why its expected to run TBB always if you only need vidalia for
torifying cygwin, thunderbird, gpg, keyservers, etc.
Also which general announce/mailing list informs for updates to all OS TBB's

they also use google dns servers as their backup resolvers ...
and used easy-rsa for their certs ...

the problem isn't with the way they chose to create certs.
it suggests they may have taken shortcuts/easy options elsewhere
that's enough to be off-putting

i have an iptables firewall rule to log and drop ACK scans and it was
unusual to see that each of the 4 connected relays at that particular
moment (a few minutes after logging into the desktop GUI) all attempted
an ACK scan in lots of 6 attempts almost precisely 2 minutes apart -
omitted the relay IP's

@_subject: [tor-talk] using torbirdy + thunderbird: domains emailing with dmarc 
im a little concerned about the following and still trying to figure it out:
if multiple parties are using torbirdy with thunderbird and lets say
some domain owners have dmarc setup with reporting enabled
other dmarc capable domains (gmail, hotmail) will send back reports with
the IP used for mail transmission & respond with fail or pass
essentially you'll see fail every time if you use torbirdy *and* your
domain is configured with dmarc, and its going to leak the IP you sent
email from (logged in with thunderbird to send) defeating the purpose of
using torbirdy
the dmarc queries are going out in the usual clear dns
are there any other shortcomings here that are of concern?
is dmarc reporting too privacy invasive in this situation to bother
implementing, and better left to business/companies ?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Pissed off about Blacklists, and what to do? 
try placing an ad on Gumtree
you must post it from an *IP* of the country you are placing an ad about
if you then use a *Tor exit node for that country* still no go and all
support ticket requests are autocratically ignored and closed without
reasoning - officially worse than Go Daddy & love responding quickly and
craply (when they do respond)
reading their support responses from another different IP?
tst tst tst
using a different browser user agent ?
naughty naughty - they fingerprint & assign you a lovely machID
but its not like their parent companies ebay/paypal in that you have
already given them verifiable personal information for fraud prevention;
Gumtree was an experience OTT

@_subject: [tor-talk] using locally installed Tor in TBB 
in 3.6.3 TBB linux amd-64 i changed the port to 9050
my local install of Tor is on the jessie alpha channel
when i close & restart TBB i get:
Something Went Wrong!
Tor is not working in this browser.
this is repeatable behaviour opening/closing TBB
some Tor log looks ok though and apart from logs it obviously does work
on 9050
[NOTICE] Bootstrapped 85%: Finishing handshake with first hop.
[NOTICE] Bootstrapped 90%: Establishing a Tor circuit.
[NOTICE] Tor has successfully opened a circuit. Looks like client
functionality is working.
[NOTICE] Bootstrapped 100%: Done.
[NOTICE] New control connection opened.
as an aside would it be discouraged to use the alpha in TBB and not the
bundled Tor version 0.2.4.22 (git-345e00dc68a052fe) ?
pros/cons either way ?
