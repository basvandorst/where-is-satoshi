@_subject: Xchat-amd64 doesn't connect 
Hi. I tried to use Xchat for AMD64 (unofficial Debian Sarge) with TOR
as a SOCKS4 proxy server and I can't connect to it. GAIM/IRC (AMD64)
and Xchat-i386 work perfectly. Is it possible to be something with the
server, since it is not a fully implemented SOCKS4 proxy? Or not?

@_subject: Transparent SOCKS proxy for POP 
Is it possible to use TOR to recieve e-mail via some sort of
transparent proxy? How could I set the torrc?
And, if I am not asking too much, how could I set the redirection via
Linux's iptables?

@_subject: Error 403 
Hi all. I am using tor 0.1.0.17 for Ubuntu (Breezy) with
FascistFirewall option turned on and am having the following error:
[warn] connection_dir_client_reached_eof(): Received http status code
403 ("Forbidden") from server '84.41.143.100'. Failing.
Does anyone know what may it be? I have 403 error for every single
host I try to access (ie: at each tor start). And this particular one
asks for a password when in access, which is probably the cause of the
problem. If so, does anyone know how to handle that?
Thanks in advance,

The problem was that the line
HttpsAuthenticator username:password
wasn't present. My bad...

Yes, it's possible. As long as a modified tor as well

I think that a redundant system would be the best thing. The main
hidden wiki could contain script that backs the site up every X hours,
and anyone could download it and host anywhere.
Or, maybe, some more softsticated high availability system could run
on the background to host the same "hostname" from different sources.
Thus, the master onion servers would point to the last one which
request the .onion hostname. For this, there should be a need to
share, among the hidden wiki mirrors, the same private key, which
implicates in full trust between the mirrorers.

I think that if two or more hidden services used the same private key,
thus the same .onion hostname, the master servers would always point
to the latest updated. It's like a dynamic IP hostname service, like
no-ip.org. Maybe one of us could deploy a test like this:
- person A hosts a html site saying: this is host A
- person B hosts a html site saying: this is host B
but persons A & B use the same private key. Then, they could, just to
equal host usage, schedule tor restarts each 2 hours. So, in even
hours host A would respond, and in pair hours host B would respond.
And this, automatically.
If it works, then both hosts should syncronize their content, and tho
this I would suggest some scripttable rsync or unison approach.
Was I clear? Sorry for my poor english.
