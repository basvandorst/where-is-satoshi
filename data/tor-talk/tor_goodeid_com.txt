@_subject: Is "gatereloaded" a Bad Exit? 
I don't think that "tor" should be dictating what ports must or must not be open on an exit node. This is after all a voluntary operation. If people want to send unencrypted data, they will do so with or without these 5 nodes. Shutting them or others down as exits will not make up for users that don't bother to secure their data.
I will do my little bit to show my disagreement with the actions that have been taken by taking 'goodeid' offline until such time as cooler heads resolve this situation without jumping to unfounded conclusions.
