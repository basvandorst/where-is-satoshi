@_subject: [tor-talk] Bad performance in private tor network 
Hi, I have set up a private tor network of around 25 relays and am stress
testing it. The stress test first starts all the relays, waits for around
10 mins for the tor network to stabilize and then starts clients that
bombard the network with traffic. Its performance is very low, around 60
http request response transactions per second node. Some diagnosis reveals
that there is a big skew in usage of the relays with some relays running
lightly and others very loaded. Is this acceptable performance. Any ideas
for improving performance?
