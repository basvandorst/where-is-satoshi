@_subject: [tor-talk] change /etc/hosts? 
I have a server in a country where tor is not allowed
I have changed the resolv.conf file so the server points to the tunnell nameserver
the tunnel has a ptr record
but here is the log message
May 28 13:30:39.000 [notice] Now checking whether ORPort 123.123.123.123:443 is reachable... (this may take up to 20 minutes -- look for log messages indicating success)
May 28 13:50:17.000 [warn] Your server (123.123.123.123:443) has not managed to confirm that its ORPort is reachable. Please check your firewalls, ports, address, /etc/hosts file, etc.
should i change the /etc/hosts to tunnel name and IP address?
