@_subject: [tor-talk] Evening Standard Article - Invisible Web 
Hello all,
I'm a journalist writing a long feature for the Evening Standard magazine,
about the Invisible Web. As part of this, I'd like to speak to Tor users
about how and why they use the service. The more interesting the use case,
the better, and if you're based in London that's an added bonus.
If you'd like to talk, please drop me an email ? t
cheshire at gmail.com. I'm happy to keep names anonymous and out of print if
you'd prefer.
My deadline is May 8.
Many thanks,
Tom Cheshire
