Personally I think that you would find alot of mostly related information at
under tools they have some programs that allow you to interrogate hacked comps.
The thing that might be most interesting is to look in the
"whitepapers" section and see how they respond to their hacked
computers. I realize that this isn't a how-to or a step by step, but I
am pretty certain that the information will be useful to you.
Good luck

OK... I am a big one for admitting when I was wrong. I was wrong. The Hosts file, while a good Idea, will not help with the tor -> google issue. Google will serve up whichever version of google you need based on your IP from any of their servers that you request it from.  test
 a ping of   with an unmodified hosts file reveals the IP:64.233.161.147 a ping of   (Ireland) shows the IP:

I then realized that they are handling the web page change on their end of the connection ( so changing the IP address of

On the other hand I now have a much better handle on the hosts file and the DNS service in windows. I now have to endorse   as probably the only solution to this problem.

Well you have the people in place that are constantly mirroring
(wgetting) the files. since they are wgettting the files you have some
control over the file names. While I say that the problem would be in
having people host torrent files for you. I was about to launch into a
lengthy explanation on how it could be done, but i realized that you
are pretty smart and prolly figured it out allready. Leave it at it
can be done, but two things you need to take into account are need for
this kind of service, as in people who want torrents, and the
possiblility of someone else including a virus into your software and
serving it up like it came from you. Althought I guess you could do a
MD5 hash of the final product to verify results. I have heard recently
that MD5 isn't the most secure anymore... I will look more into that

most of the censoring, in china at least, is done automatically with
no human intervention. In my statement I ment that having an exit node
behind the firewall would give us the same restrictions that they are
having to deal with right now. for most people that really wouldn't
impact their lives that much, except that there would be some pages
that you counldn't view, and some messages that you couldn't send.
           BUT.
there is always a but,
We, for the most part, are from countires that don't have restrictions
on speach, so we would set off all of the flags that the censoring
software was looking for, and the ISP would be ordered to cut the
connection pretty quickly. Personally I don't think that an exit or
entry server would last more than 5 minutes on china's web.

To the government of china those servers would look like really active

knew what tor was, having an entry or exit node behind the wall would
probably "force their hand" if they are just stalling on having an
official policy on TOR as a government.
honestly thought the classes of people who would most likely be using
TOR are the educated people. the educated people are the ones who hate
censorship the most.
that would be the students, college kids, professionals and minor

the two configurations. Not to nock tor but right now I think that the
choke point of the equation is in the tor network, and that we won't
really be able to test the operational speed of the torpark vs

to help with the overall usefullness of the service. Plus from the 5 or so
minutes that I have been thinking about it there are some very interesting
optimizations that could be done to the process to make it work better for
torrents over strait p2p. if they built it in to the client, and didn't give
people the option of being just a middleman then they would probably
completely solve the exit server problem. I would also be willing to bet
that the service of said hypothetical network would be pretty decent.
already they only allow downloading equal to uploading, so if they made it
into a three way balance between up, down, and onion then there would not be
any desparity between users on the network and the networks ability to serve
up files.

Mirroring is something that I really don't know that much about.
 Now that I am sitting here Brain storming i wonder if there is a way to
mirror one of Tor's Hidden services. that would be kinda neat. as a Concept
it sounds cool, But I feel like in reality it probably isn't possable. I say
this only because I think it sounds like a good idea and the universe is to
perverse to let something like that happen. So those who know more than I...
Is that kind of thing possible?
 (Sorry arrakis BTW, I don't know)

@_subject: Mirroring a Hidden Service 
I meant more for Mirroring my own site while having the creation and owner
of the site invisible. I could create and edit the page on my local machine,
host it as a hidden service, send a command to an external computer that
causes it to update to the hidden-service ans load it as a web page. as the
author I would remain anonymous even if "The Man" ever got the box that the
webpage was actually sitting on.

for normal consumption I don't know. but What happens when yea old chinese

@_subject: Slashdot banning Tor? 
correct me if I am wrong, but Dos attacks would require quite a bit of bandwidth, and usually follow some very distinct modus operandi. probably noticeable by the tor client. Is there a way to build some kind of Dos and DDos protection into the tor network or maybe even the client. if only to keep it from being abused in this fashion?
 As I said earlier, I dont know.

good news as of:
 in the second post they say that they have already used DPA2 with the portable file thumb system. the posts also said that while it worked, there was a slightly noticable lag with the DPA release over the standard stable release while using the portable thumb drive. (something about it not being compressed the same I will try it out my self later on tonight and let you know what I find.

@_subject: Call for help to the smart people 
Only slightly off TOR topic, but only slightly since it is for that portable firefox thumb drive thingie
I am working on creating *(read: have created)* a batch file to check for the existance of the tor folder in:
  %userprofile%\application data\  and if it doesn't find it to make that dir and copy my torrc and cached-directory files to that dir.
 I have gotten the batch file to work consistantly in command, but cannot get it to work in cmd or windows.  (oddly enough showing how dos is more dynamic than windows... SUPRISE :-)  has anyone else encountered these kinds of problems before?
 yes I know that this prolly isn't the best forum for this kind of question, but you guys are the most open minded smart people I know, and yes I did check the tor wiki first. no I didn't find anything in the wiki about this.  Thanks

@_subject: Anonymity on mobile devices 
Mobile comunication anonymity is good, and probably something that is needful as well. I don't personally think that I would be comfortable broadcasting wirelessly any information that I was trying to keep personal. Not to knock SSL and TOR or any other encryption scheems, but any code can be broken given time. (Maybe not easily, but in theory it can be done) Overall the scheme is probably secure, but the biggest potential weakness probably lies in the wireless broadcast of information. At the very least it makes it much easier for "the man" to watch both ends of the connection.
 but this is all theoretical, odds are that you are more than secure with this scheme.

@_subject: Anonymity on mobile devices 
I like the idea of the gateway further not knowing the final product, but more useful would be if you could find some way to reverse the process or add a link so that the gateway wouldn 't know who the origin was. I know that this is just adding more trouble to the processing plate. I would be interested in hearing what kind of hand shake you are thinking about doing if not public key. I know that there are some good other one's, but none that are quite on the same level of security. Or perhaps the device could handle just the one public key exchange with out overloading. If you don't have any good idea's, I have some ideas that could be usefull to you. kind of depends on what specifically you are guarding against though. In effect: What are you trying to hide? Your actions, Your Identity/Location, or some combination of both?
As to your question:
Wireless is always going to be a security risk because we have yet to invent perfect encryption. It makes it almost imposible to get rid of risk and there is always risk while your enemies are able to freely collect your private information at will and without your knowledge.
curiosity, what costs the user more than 1 euro each time?....
or in other words
what does this  sentence mean...
<2. the OR list is quite big and cost the user more than 1 euro each time>

this sounds virusish, but could insert a daemon into the running webserver
that would redirect your packets to the correct tor port? the same kind of
idea that root kits use to hide themselves?

I hadn't noticed, but I am seeing the same thing. Personally I beleive it to
be coincidence... Unless others have noticed this to be a growing trend tor

@_subject: TOR Park Exit Node Question 
I created something like 10 circuts through torpark, one after the other,
over the space of 5 minutes. the ip:
195.169.149.213 was the only exit that I connected to more than once, but that one only came
up twice (and not in a row either) Since all of the other connections were
all different, I have to assume that this server is just -=*coincidentally*=-
getting alot of traffic from tor.

@_subject: TOR Park Exit Node Question 
while hard to believe, I have to ask what method does the tor app use to
generate "randomness"?
is it at all based on hardware configurations? or maybe dependent upon
timing of events?

@_subject: What happened with the Tor USB Keychain idea? 
after some basic looking around this is what I have come up with.
 firefox portable works fine on a thumbdrive.
 Trillian Anywere also works fine on thumb/zip
 a basic listing of other programs that work well on thumb is here:
 I don't know how well tor and privoxy would work from a thumb drive. I have some vauge idea about using a autorun.ini file to install them and then some how setting up a uninstall program on the thumbdrive... but then you would loose the functionality of just pulling out the thumbdrive... I just don't know.

@_subject: What happened with the Tor USB Keychain idea? 
well that kind of does wrap it up dosn't it. I already have a thumbdrive though. I wonder if I can just buy the software sans thumbdrive. I will email them and tell you their responce.

I would be more than happy to help test/design this... although how good I would be at designing i don't know.
I am good at breaking things reliably... not at making them work.

@_subject: Torpark writes to system temp folder 
I beleive, although I am not certain, that this is because the
temporary folder is relative to the base drive letter that the torpark
folder rests in. so you are probably correct in that it is because you
aren't using a thumbdrive.
I will attempt to confirm this and get back to the group.

@_date: 2006-02-24 17:35:18
@_author: Matt Thorne 
@_subject: Torpark writes to system temp folder 
I can also confirm that in all cases that I have run on the new
torpark, there are files that are created and erased when the program
closes. This happens when you use a thumb drive or a folder on the
       Impeding further research into what exactly is causing this
though, is the fact that PortableApps.com seems to be having web page
problems. given though, that the temporary files are erased upon
closure, I think that the security risk is minimal for the moment. it
appears that when the program closes, it cleans up after it self, and
in the process leaves one file behind.
the file, called  is 6k in size consistently. I checked
out what I could with a hex editor and couldn't find anything that
changed from file to file in the six different times I examined it.
each time I peered at it was after putting Torpark through its paces,
eg: navigating the net. So I don't personally think that there is any
session information stored in the file.
        For a better opinion on this file you will probably have to
ask John or Steve.
        There won't be much evidence to go on unless you are caught in
the act, at which point there will be better evidence than a small
hard to notice file buried in the computer.
so there you have it, alot of words not to say much about anything.

@_subject: Suggestion to beat the bandwidth abuse 
If I am not mistaken, alot of the p2p traffic that is flying over Tor
is BitTorrent. I am not personally aware of a way to regulate the use
of bittorrent in the way that you describe, since it breaks every file
in to small manageable chunks. Plus the whole consept would require
monitoring what Tor is used for, which I think is counter to what they
are trying to do at the moment.
A worthy concept, IMO, but possibly not the best Implimentation/Solution.
Just thoughts
