@_subject: [tor-talk] Blur screen in TBB with fractional scaling 
I recently installed Kali with Wayland support.
I enabled fractional scaling because of hidpi monitor, using 150% scale.
Im trying to setup TBB, but the screen is blur.
The only firefox version i can setup properly is nightly.
Do i missed something, or TBB dont support fractional scaling?
I tried the Alpha version and the repo's version. None of them working.

Hi Georg!
I know that TBB based on firefox-esr, but as is see ff 68 has Wayland
Seems like fractional scaling is pain to firefox.
