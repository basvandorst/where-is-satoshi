@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Bridges No Longer Work 
The oddest thing. Tor bridges no longer work on my system.
Has something changed with regards to how bridges are used?
I have a Windows SP3 system, fully updated and patched, with Tor 0.2.1.30.
Within the last 14 days, Tor will no longer connect when I have Vidalia
set to use bridges. Won't connect at all.
The logs show the error message, "No known bridges."
That's odd, as my bridge definitions are completely up to date.
As soon as I untick the option not to use bridges Tor connects instantly.
Perhaps I should not be using bridges? Has something in the code base
I'm at a loss to explain this, as my current configuration has worked
for several years.
Thanks for the help.

My bridges are completely updated.
That I would receive an error stating "No known working bridges found"
(my wording)
puzzled me. To this day, I am unable to connect using bridges at all.
Nothing has changed on my box so I'm at a total loss to explain this.
Recently, someone posted a question to the effect that how does a user
know which bridges are active and which are not?
I'd love to know that myself. And bridges don't work from here.

I, too have never found a recipe for success with Countermail.
Indeed, the Countermail Engine requires Java in order to work.
I have seen web traffic from the Countermail Team regarding
Java security issues. You may want to write to them directly
and ask. They will respond. They'll explain to you why they feel
it's not an issue.
I actually wound up accessing Countermail through Google Chrome
and a Tor connection with JanusVPN. That works well, but then
with Tor you run into the issue where you can login, but then you go
to access your mail, or reply and you have to login again due to
Tor's constantly shifting IP's.  Countermail was supposed to be
working on this issue,but I've yet to see a resolution.
Bottom line, without Java CM won't work and with Tor it doesn't
play nicely either.

Actually, one CAN use Countermail in an email client such as Thunderbird
, with the appropriate
settings, and  with Tor. I just set that up. No real need to access
Countermail through
a browser.

I wish I could be of more assistance here.
I use JanusVPN. As a VPN it routes all TCP traffic on my machine through
Tor. Thus, I don't need any special settings in Thunderbird to proxy
Countermail through Tor. I use the standard Countermail server
settings. I did not have to change them.
Perhaps a note to the Countermail Team would help. I'm sure they
can help with the recommended settings.
Sorry I could not be of more help.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Good email services? 
I like both Securenym and also Countermail.
Countermail is based in Sweden.
Both services, however, are subscription based.
Each has their own set of advantages.
Countermail is very good.
For free services, I've always liked Privatdemail.
Clearly, these guys seem to be on Our Team.
I do not know whether or not they are affiliated with the German
Privacy Foundation, but they are strong philosophical
opponents of data retention.
Their data storage is encrypted. I believe their servers are in Egypt.
They use SSL on Port 995.
No web mail.
Yes, the one downside, is that they will require a registration email.
That was no problem for me, as I maintain several anonymous accounts.
I think they're definitely worth checking out.
