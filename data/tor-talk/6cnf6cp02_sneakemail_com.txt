@_subject: Tutorials for providing Hidden Services? 
I want to provide basic free anonymous blogging services using Tor's hidden services. Are there any tutorials for this, apart from the basic setup information on Torproject.org? More specifically, how can I stop my users from identifying my server? What do I have to pay attention to?
How can I block connection attempts by Apache using my external network interface, eg. if the users execute scripts that contact external addresses? What information is exposed by environment variables, and how can I stop the user from reading them? For example, can I modify timezone/timestamps to obfuscate my server location?
What settings do I have to change to fully remove Apache's IP logging to protect my users?

@_subject: Performance optimizations for high-bandwidth Tor exit 
I've been running a Tor exit node on one of my machines (Intel Dual E2160 (1.8GHz), 2GB RAM, Xen domU for Tor, encrypted HDD) for some months. It is on a shared 100MBit/s line (500GB in/out daily). I have not configured any bandwidth limits within Tor.
Most of the time, the Tor process maxes out the CPU (85-100%), while memory consumption stays at ~10%; until today, this didn't pose much of a problem as log files show no errors and the machine
has been used exclusively for Tor.
I now want to play around with hidden services, and noticed that
Apache takes a very long time to reply, even to local requests.
As I am already using Xen, I thought it might be possible to
share CPU and memory intelligently between two domUs (with the
Tor domU having lower priority), but I didn't find any useful
information how to do that.
Are there any performance tweaks to limit Tor's CPU consumption? NumCPUs is set to 2, other than that I didn't modify the default configuration much. Also, niceness is set to +15 for the tor
process. I want to avoid setting a fixed bandwidth limit, Tor should use "as much as it gets". Will upgrading the CPU help?
