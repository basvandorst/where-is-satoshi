@_subject: [tor-talk] myproxy.dyndns.org instead of IP? 
Dear experts, my question concerns the IP/fingerprint combination to pass to other users in order to reach the relay network:
My IP is changed every day by my DSL provider. However, I have a dyndns.org web address. Does it work and does it make sense to pass the myproxy.dyndns.org / fingerprint combination? How to enter it in torrc?
any ideas, suggestions, comments?
I'm running tor on opensuse 11.3 Linux 64bit
Thanks for your help
