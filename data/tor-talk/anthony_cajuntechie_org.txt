Hello, A friend is hell bent on running Tor on a Linux VM hosted on Windows 8. this doesn't seem like the best idea to me but I thought I'd ask the experts.  What are the security implications of doing so? Are there any mitigations that can make things more secure? Any 'gotchas'? For what it's worth,  the have chosen to use VirtualBox over VMware.

A friend of mine needs an anonymous Reddit account. So I fired up Tor

what username he chooses, he is told "care to try these again?" and
cannot register an account. The password and username boxes all have
green checkmarks by the, so that isn't the problem.
Anyone else have this problem? Has Reddit banned Tor connections from
registering new accounts?

Sorry, but this is crap. The Tor project has a lot of problems that they

You're not punishing the Tor project by shutting your relay down. You're
putting peoples lives in danger because of a political issue you have

kerfuffle with Jacob worth someone's life?  I suppose only you can

@_subject: [tor-talk] sadly have to shut down my tor relay after less then 
It's actually pretty easy and you definitely don't have to be a coder:
1. Find your torrc file and open it in a text editor
2. Search for 'ExitPolicy' (all one word) to find the right section
3. Enter a list of the ports you want to allow. Example:
  	ExitPolicy accept *:443
Make sure all of the other ExitPolicy statements are either deleted or
commended out. The exit policy above allows ports 80 and 443 (for web
access), and ports 110, 143, 465, 587 for email access. It rejects
anything else.
This should stop your copyright infringement problem or at least reduce
it to almost nothing since the users would be restricted to stuff they
can get on regular websites (no torrents, USENET groups, etc).
Hope this helps!

Additionally, the crypto of BM has never been properly verified as I

all we can really say is that BM is a great idea that may or may not
protect users but could go further.

Never? If we never hear from him again should we simply assume he's

I see a lot of people talking about how Tor is pwned by the US
Government and is insecure 'by design'. I'm assuming that they know
this from a thorough analysis of the source code, which I freely admit
I haven't done. So, since you guys actually have taken the time to
audit the source and find the vulnerabilities that would allow Tor to
be so easily pwned, could you explain it to me and, preferable, post
relevant sections (or links to sections) of the source you're basing
your statements on?
I'd really like to investigate these vulnerabilities myself but the
code is too massive for one person to realistically audit by
themselves so links would be very helpful.

@_author: Anthony Papillion 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Question for those who say "Tor is pwned" 
Hash: SHA512
True. However, I'm not sure how that's a 'pwned by design' thing
(which ascribes malicious intent to the Tor Project). You know who is
to blame for the 'owning the route' problem? We are. How many people
use Tor but won't run a node of their own? And. yes, I realize that a
lot of people might not be technical enough to run one but there are
places you can pay to do it for you.
But, if you are the US military and you were designing a network to be
'insecure by design', using route owning is a really crappy way to do
it. Essentially, anyone can deanonymize anyone. Even the mighty US
Government isn't safe because, what's stopping China from deploying
even more nodes than the US and thus being able to deanonymize US
spooks using the network? It would be a never-ending game of
one-upsmanship that would, essentially, result in greater security for
users. And, if they're doing that, why aren't more US spies being
busted by China or Chinese spies being busted by the US? Oh, I know!
They are just keeping /really/ quiet about it so we don't suspect that
Tor is compromised, right?
Don't get me wrong, I don't believe there are no problems with Tor.
But I think we need to look at how such ownership would work in
practice. Ultimately, it would end up in a major international
competition that would benefit users.

I couldn't agree more. I understand that the decision to hire any

hiding it from the community calls into question the vaunted
'transparancy' the project constantly talks about. If they weren't
forthcoming about this, a major development that could absolutely
effect community trust, one has to wonder what else they aren't being
completely forthcoming about with the community?
OTOH, I think the leak about DaveC should also strengthen our trust in
the integrity of the people who run the Tor Project. They didn't just
say 'let's lie about it and hide it from the community'. There was
great debate, a lot of discussion, and a bit of agonizing how to best
handle this. They didn't take this lightly by any means. Still, in the
end, we have what we have and that's not good.
Tor Project definitely needs to address this publicly. This misstep
