@_subject: Tor Browser Bundle for Mac OS X released 
Thanks for providing a Browser Bundle for Mac OS X!
Extension Security is not enabled by default in the Bundle. I suggest it beeing turned on by default.
I would like to suggest for discussion to include the following Firefox extensions:
SSL Blacklist:
Checks for SSL Certificates with weak keys and MD5 signed certificates.
IIRC this is DNS based which is likely to be very slow due to high DNS latency with tor.
Only loads Flash content after user interaction, or from whitelist.
(I am aware that Torbutton should deactivate all Plug-Ins including Flash.)
Certificate Patrol:
Alerts the user when sites present a new/unknown SSL certificate.

ToS require everything to be in a single binary. If one could just run a shell binary of Tor (like Sid77 showed for jailbroken iDevices) in an AppStore savvy way I?m pretty sure there already would be a Tor-Browser for iOS.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Run Multiple Mac Vidalia/Tor Bundle Apps? 
Just out of curiosity: Why would you need multiple instances running simultanously?
You can run as may tor instances from the command line and pass each one a separate config file to use as you like. (Or as your machine can handle.) You do have to use a distinct listener Port for each service of each instance of course.
Same goes for polipo.
This has nothing to do with Mac OS X in particular.

I?d like to emphasize that this only works on _jailbroken_ devices at all and when using WiFi (since you cannot (easily) add a SOCKS proxy for GSM/CDMA connections). I still appreciate all the work Marco hat put into making this possible.
Stephan?s CovertBrowser works on normal iOS devices and over GSM/CDMA which clearly is an improvement. I agree that CovertBrowser should be audited properly to meet tor standards.
Both ways are a definite improvement for iOS users who had no way to use tor before.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Does obfsproxy make any sense for relays 
I was wondering if building tor with obfsproxy would make any sense for a relay. The documentation suggests that obfsproxy is rather exclusive for bridges yet isn?t absolutely clear about that.
The only scenario I can fabricate is someone blocking tor by DPI, being confident that they can block any tor traffic and subsequently doesn?t bother to explicitly block relay IPs anymore. Doesn?t seem too realistic to me.
Would it hurt to implement obfsproxy into a relay?
Thanks in advance!

May I draw the following conclusion from that or have I fallen for a misunderstanding?
Implementing obfsproxy as instructed here
but not setting "BridgeRelay 1" does actually make sense to potentially help people reach tor? (Given the way Iran currently handles tor traffic.)
This is what I meant with ?implementation?. I guess it was bad wording on my part (since I?m not native english speaking). I did net actually mean to incorporate obfsproxy functionality into the tor binary (at the moment).

I?m actually thinking about real hardware, like quad Xeon 19" server hardware. If I could boot those from a USB stick or other tiny flash module I could totally skip any mass storage, reducing price and energy consumption. Only question would be support for hardware acceleration like AES-NI for current intel i-series of processors.
While I cannot send you ALIX hardware to test with, I?m happy to test for you as I?ve got two of those boards here for testing. (They can boot from compact flash or USB.) The AMD Geode sports a 128bit AES hardware accelerator and it?s a very good idea to support that. Under nanoBSD (FreeBSD for embedded systems) tor performance rose from about 1Mbit/s to 8Mbit/s.

You can simply visit  to get a cookie that will tell YT to always use HTML5 video instead of Flash. If you're reasonably averse to cookies from Google/YouTube you can add &html5=True to any YT URL to directly link to the HTML5 version like so.
This may or may not work in TorBrowser depending on your platform and Plug-Ins you have activated since Mozilla is allergic to playing MPEG4/H.264 video even if handing off playback to the OS would perfectly be possible. (But that is a totally different kind of discussion.)

The meeting was planned way before the recent rulings in Austria became known but they will be discussed for certain.
The actual purpose of the meeting shall be to finally found a Torservers.at organisation (German word: Verein) in Austria that works on running nodes in the public interest as well as exchange know-how and best practice on running relays, bridges and exits.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Exit Operator convicted in Austrian lower court 
I totally agree. It contradicts Austrian legislation of the so called ?Provider's privilege? which states that the operator or provider of a service is not liable for the data transmitted over said service.
Following that mis-ruling the Austrian Post Office would be liable for the goods they deliver (as well as any other delivery service, like packages, food, Amazon, or basically any ISP as well.)
We'll see how that continues.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Exit Operator convicted in Austrian lower court 
No, absolutely NOT. Actually, the opposite is the reality. Austria has something commonly called the ?Provider's Privilege? (non-legalese term) which states that a service provider is not liable for the data transported over said services. No matter if the service is a free or paid one.
There is no law that I have ever heard of that prohibits running a proxy server or a Tor node in general or in particular. Providing an online service in Austria is mostly regulated by the Telecommunications law, E-Commerce law and data-protection law.
German language Austrian Legalese background:
Austrian E-Commerce Law ?15: Ausschluss der Verantwortlichkeit bei Zwischenspeicherungen ? 15. Ein Diensteanbieter, der von einem Nutzer eingegebene Informationen in einem Kommunikationsnetz ?bermittelt, ist f?r eine automatische, zeitlich begrenzte Zwischenspeicherung, die nur der effizienteren Gestaltung der auf Abruf anderer Nutzer erfolgenden Informations?bermittlung dient, nicht verantwortlich, sofern er
IANAL Paraphrased:
A service provider who transmits user-input over a communications-network is not liable for a automated, time restricted caching which only purpose is to more effectively provide information requested by a user given that:
Austrian E-Commerce Law ?3.1: Begriffsdefinitionen: Diensteanbieter
1. Dienst der Informationsgesellschaft: ein in der Regel gegen Entgelt elektronisch im Fernabsatz auf individuellen Abruf des Empf?ngers bereitgestellter Dienst (? 1 Abs. 1 Z 2 Notifikationsgesetz 1999), insbesondere der Online-Vertrieb von Waren und Dienstleistungen, Online-Informationsangebote, die Online-Werbung, elektronische Suchmaschinen und Datenabfragem?glichkeiten sowie Dienste, die Informationen ?ber ein elektronisches Netz ?bermitteln, die den Zugang zu einem solchen vermitteln oder die Informationen eines Nutzers speichern;
IANAL paraphrased:
Definition of Information-Service: A __commonly__ _paid-for_ provided service for individual use by the recipient, especially online-sales of goods and services, online information, onilne advertising, electronic search-engines and data-query as well as ___services that transport information over an electronic network or that provide access to such a network or that store a user's information__. (Emphasis mine)
First instance courts in Austria have been traditionally problematic with highly technical cases since they usually lack technical expertise. Austria does not have case-law, so the danger of this becoming precedent should be rather low.
The latter is very likely the case and I hope to have better (first or second hand) information in the next few days. I won't speculate more until I have talked to a few people who have actual information.
Similarly ridiculous parallels have been drawn. Why not close the postal system and every parcel delivery service as well. :-)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Exit Operator convicted in Austrian lower court 
I've talked to William's lawyer in person as well as the ISPA jurist (Austrian Inter Service Provider's Association) who both joined our Tor-ops meeting in Vienna yesterday (2014-07-03).
What I can sum up:
It is not illegal to run a Tor relay/exit/bridge in Austria.
We can not take William's case any further.
William's lawyer said he personally considers the court judgement to be wrong.
The Austrian Tor-Community is working to form an official association (Verein) to get a better standing. Goals shall be education about anonymity, better communication with law enforcement, better communication with ISPs as well as the usual technical mumble to build secure and high bandwidth relays.
Building up a legal defense fund and getting a clear statement on whether Tor-networks fall under the legal term of ?communications network? as defined in ECG ?13 is also part of that.
So if you're in Austria and run a relay/exit/bridge, please get in touch, join our Mailinglist (yes another one) at torservers.at to see if you can help and to stay in the loop.

This is a cross posting tor-talk/tor-relays (Due to the current attention on the recent events in Austria. Thanks for understanding.)
Niko Alm (of Austrian political party NEOS) has made an official parliamentary inquiry to the Austrian ministry of justice about the legal status of Tor.
Blog posting:  (in german language)
Inquiry:  (in german language)
In theory running a relay/exit _should_ be covered by Austrian E-Commerce law ?13. It's just not legally proven that Tor also falls under the definition of a ?communications network? from a legal point of view. Technically everyone would certainly agree that this is the case.
From what I understand the goal is to get an official statement by the Austrian ministry of justice that Tor falls under the legal definition of a communications network. Which would mean, that Relay-Ops are not liable for the traffic passing through their relays given they

@_subject: [tor-talk] Dropping Tor Browser support for Mac OSX 10.6? 
That would first mean to provide 64-bit binaries for OS X at all. At the moment all OS X TorBrowser Bundles' Firefox and tor binary are 32bit only.
$ file /Applications/TorBrowser.app/Contents/MacOS/TorBrowser.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox
firefox: Mach-O executable i386
$ file /Applications/TorBrowser.app/Tor/tor.real
tor.real: Mach-O executable i386
So before TBB is available as 64bit binaries, there is little benefit in moving to 10.7+ only.
Are there OS metrics for TBB? Couldn't find any on Also, OS X 10.10 Yosemite is just around the corner which will EOL 10.7. Further given the fact that all Macs that support 10.8 als do support 10.9 and 10.10 this may be the better point to move to a 10.8+ build and drop 10.7 (which is a terrible release almost nobody uses) in the same process.
There are only 2 Mac models that are intel and 32bit only. So I guess the percentage of TBB users among these is mostly negligible. But a stated above, everthing is i386 atm anyway.
Creating a Tails USB-Stick _on OS X_ is basically impossible for the general public, and a helluva process for the technically inclined. (It's not just dd the image and reboot.) So I'd say, no, at the moment, absolutely not. At least not before Tails Sticks are easy to create and stable to boot on that hardware.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Load Balancing/High Availability Hidden Services 
I'm looking into ideas for creating ?load balanced? or ?high availability? hidden services. Mostly pertaining to web servers serving large-ish static files. (Let's say 5-100MB each.)
Load balanced as in not all requests end up at the same box to speed up downloads.
High availability as in the service is still available if one box goes down or is taken offline for maintenance.
So, not exactly your usual distributed-cluster setup.
From what I understand it would not make sense to run the same HS Key on multiple boxes since the descriptors would overwrite each other every few minutes.
I don't think one can do something like Round-Robin DNS with HS.
So the only way I can imagine this to work is a central redirection node that know about all the nodes and more or less intelligently/randomly 302 redirects each file request to a known-to-it server.
This still leaves a single-point-of-failure in form of the redirection server but would at least distribute the traffic load across multiple servers and cope for nodes coming and going.
Has anyone done something like this?
Thanks a bunch!

This cannot be a real onion address because it contains the character "1" which is impossible for real onions. "1" is specifically not a character used by Base32 encoding used by onion addresses.
Since the domain name is obviously incorrect for the .onion TLD it's questionable if a tool should even try to connect to it. Likewise you'd refuse any .onion domain that isn't of exactly 16 (v2 onion) or 54 characters (v3 onion) in length.
Maybe some systems that usually resolve hostnames through tor, fall back to a local or another resolver when they receive an NX as a fallback.
