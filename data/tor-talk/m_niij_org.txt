@_subject: [tor-talk] Implement JSONP interface for check.torproject.org 
Excerpts from Jim's message of 2011-11-06 06:06:39 +0100:
While I do like the idea, I agree with Jim here. How about this: Instead of serving JavaScript/JSONP, serving an image directly would make it
more compatible with some users' browser settings. A plain link to check.tp.o
or something similiar (geared more towards explaining what this is about
perhaps, instead of a simple check) could deal with the rest.
I just woke up but I'll submit a patch in a bit.

A cautionary tale:  at around 7:18 a
spec'd Acrobat feature is "launch arbitrary applications and commands". Neat
isn't it?
