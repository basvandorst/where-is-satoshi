This is a dealbreaker.  It has to have this.
I wish some trusted entity who has a bit of money and, um, gusto for a
fight, would set up an email service with a .onion entry point.  The
EFF comes to mind, but they have plenty to do.  I'm not sure what
other groups I'd trust.  I never had any idea who was running Tormail.
Don't forget Norway.
This isn't gonna cut it.  A Tormail replacement that's any good,
that's reliable, that's censorship-resistant, that's hardened, that
doesn't leak information in any of the myriad ways email can which
could serve to unmask a Tor user ... that will require professionals
to set it up.  It's not going to fly on $random_email_provider +
hidden service and a tunnel, or whatever.

* The mail system will be used for many things, including some

* The mail system will inevitably be a high-value target for

* The operators will need to install or invent controls to limit or

Here's my one teensy thing that bothers me, this bit of speculation
from Ars Technica:
"The Tor Project, whose software enabled the Silk Road, noticed a
significant spike in usage in late August and was unable to explain
it. It remains possible that the FBI or another federal agency may
have suddenly flooded Tor with its own bots or other computers under
its control as a way of conducting surveillance on the Silk Road."[1]
Can we fairly definitively say these two things are entirely
unrelated?  Do we *know* (for pretty sure) the usage spike is a greedy
botnet and not some kind of attack?

March 16 at 8:39 in the morning, the account was used to post a

the user name from Ross Ulbricht to "frosty." Several weeks later, the

I *think* people are mistaking VPN for VPS here - I can't find the

Juan Garofalo:
"As the NSA scoops up phone records and other forms of electronic
evidence while investigating national security and terrorism leads,
they turn over "tips" to a division of the Drug Enforcement Agency
("DEA") known as the Special Operations Division ("SOD"). FISA
surveillance was originally supposed to be used only in certain
specific, authorized national security investigations, but information
sharing rules implemented after 9/11 allows the NSA to hand over
information to traditional domestic law-enforcement agencies, without
any connection to terrorism or national security investigations.
But instead of being truthful with criminal defendants, judges, and
even prosecutors about where the information came from, DEA agents are
reportedly obscuring the source of these tips. For example, a law
enforcement agent could receive a tip from SOD?which SOD, in turn, got
from the NSA?to look for a specific car certain place. But
instead of relying solely on that tip, the agent would be instructed
to find his or her own reason to stop and search the car. Agents are
directed to keep SOD under wraps and not mention it in "investigative
reports, affidavits, discussions with prosecutors and courtroom
testimony," according to Reuters." [1]
"U.S. directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans
(Reuters) - A secretive U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration unit is
funneling information from intelligence intercepts, wiretaps,
informants and a massive database of telephone records to authorities
across the nation to help them launch criminal investigations of
Americans. [...]
But two senior DEA officials defended the program, and said trying to
"recreate" an investigative trail is not only legal but a technique
that is used almost daily.
A former federal agent in the northeastern United States who received
such tips from SOD described the process. "You'd be told only, ?Be at
a certain truck stop at a certain time and look for a certain
vehicle.' And so we'd alert the state police to find an excuse to stop
that vehicle, and then have a drug dog search it," the agent said.
"PARALLEL CONSTRUCTION"
After an arrest was made, agents then pretended that their
investigation began with the traffic stop, not with the SOD tip, the
former agent said. The training document reviewed by Reuters refers to
this process as "parallel construction."" [2]

@_subject: [tor-talk] Many more Tor users in the past week? 
Hash: SHA512
Meanwhile, my Tor *relay* is DOSing its own router.  If anybody from
the Raspberry Pi thread is reading (and I'll post it there later if
not when I've observed it more), on 0.2.4.x, the Pi can handle most
circuit storms without crashing (though it still does, quite rarely),
but somehow it's causing my NAT router to partially/completely fail
and I still haven't figured out exactly how.  It starts happening
*before* the ip_conntrack table is full, and it's considerably smaller
than the point at which ip_conntrack entries can trigger the OOM
killer, so I don't know yet what's causing it.  The router has also
handled plenty more simultaneous in/out bandwidth in the past.
Regardless, the router starts dropping packets, and killing Tor stops
it, and restarting Tor soon enough (so most connected clients are
still in their retry period before giving up) starts it again immediately.
In fact, I've just woken up - started my Tor node a few hours ago
before going to sleep - and it appears to be starting to beat my
router down now.  Router load isn't high, it doesn't seem out of
memory - when you can hit the status page - but ping times start to
climb or time out, and the first canary to fall over is DNS resolution
(the router "does" DNS via DNSmasq).
They're DDOSing *you*?  How so?

As Asa mentioned earlier[1], there's no corresponding traffic on
social media.  This is something people (like me) would get yelly
about on Twitter and such.
Tor connections are easy to find without searching, no?
If the botnet's purpose is to damage Tor, it may be less likely to be
caught with honey, so to speak.  If this is a feature rollout using
Tor for C&C to an existing or rapidly-growing botnet, I'd expect to
hear about it soon from security researchers.
I have a bad feeling that this is aimed at Tor itself, given other
recent developments e.g. in the NSA scandal, plus less recent
developments in nationalist "cyberwarfare."  Just a hunch, though.

Hi there,
I have been doing some testing of sending email over Tor and today ran
into a definite BadExit (but not flagged, clearly) because there was a
blatant MitM attempt on three separate occasions when I initiated a

the usual warnings, etc.  The trouble is, I don't know how to quickly
find out what exit was being used so I can tattle on it; in this case,
I'm using an old laptop with limited resources, so I just run tor at
boot and don't have the fancy Vidalia map thingy or any of that, and
I'm unfamiliar with the CLI invocations which could help me figure out
who's playing dirty tricks with their exit node.
Any advice?

Hi s7r, I can't answer most of your questions offhand, but this may
have something useful:
It's a bug I opened about the setting on low-memory machines.
s7r at sky-ip.org:
- From the above bug, I know the early minimum was 500MB.  I do not know
if or how the default was calculated.  It should now be 384MB in Tor
0.2.5.x so that relays with ~512MB of physical RAM can function (e.g.
Raspberry Pi and other little ARM boards, and doorstop Pentiums, etc.)
It is my understanding, which may be incorrect, that once this feature
- - or more accurately its immediate predecessor discussed in the bug
above - was introduced, that it was turned on by default.
Hope this is helpful.

Based on my experiences with the (terrible) Craigslist spam ghosting
algo, attempting to get help for that over the random junk I was
legitimately trying to sell which got me ghosted, and then doing a lot
of research on similar problems had by other users...
...which led me to reading about Craigslist's history of "litigation
over innovation" and the (inevitable and correct) complaining about
how terrible every /other/ part of the site is...
...and the attempts to talk to Craigslist about such problems by users
and litigation targets, all lead me to believe that attempting to
communicate with Craigslist in any way is like talking to a
particularly recalcitrant wall.  They do not care.  Sadly their US
monopoly position makes it easy for them to act like bad netizens, and
they do.  Since the classified market is basically free under them,
they're like the Windows monopoly.  Nobody else can get a fair shake
to take them down, even though a lot of people dream of it.
