If I draft an email and set the sending time as some time later, say 1
month later. Everything done by Tor web, 1 month later, if the email has
been sent, the IP address would be anonymous or not?

Thanks for the reply. I meant doing everything through "Tor browser"----
write an email but set the sending date as 1 month later. Then closed the
Tor browser.
Just wonder if the email send automatically by itself 1 month later, the IP
is still anonymous? or it's shows the IP / Location/ Machine? As by the
time the email sent, the tor browser closed although everything had been
set within Tor Browser 1 month earlier.

No software to compose email, as you mentioned, just normal email account
such as yahoo.
The reason i wonder is even the email was composed within tor browser, but
the email was actually sent 1 month later, will that show the actual IP
