I don't know if that's recommendable, but I changed the torrc,
vidalia.conf and Aurora (in the TorButton ext.) for testing purpose.
That works under windows at least.
ControlPort 9052 // One higher that usual
SocksPort 9060 // 9050 is the default, any unused should do
ControlPort 9052 // has to match the one in torrc

change the proxy port to the Socks Port in torrc, otherwise the other
Tor instance might be used, in the case it allows local access.
Any concerns or additions?

Joe Btfsplk, 26.04.2012 17:57:
Only the source has been released. 0.2.3.13-alpha has been released as
source only, too. Sometimes there are no pre-compiled versions. While I
don't know why that's the case, I know (at least I got told that, for
another project) that compiling takes up some time.
While Windows does not ship with compilers, many Linux distributions do
so. Back in 2011 there was an "source-only" release and while I was
waiting for a binary (which never came), I checked how many relays
updated to that version and was surprised that the number was increasing
rapidly over a few days.
I don't know if that's still true, since the platform strings are no
longer available on the metrics page. I was not interested in knowing
how many did. It's still possible to do so.

@_subject: [tor-talk] how does Tor generate IP Address 
anu nivas:
I hope I understand you correctly.
Tor doesn't generate IP addresses. You, the client, connect to an entry
node, which sees your IP address (but does not know where you want to
connect to), from there you connect to another node, which does not know
where the traffic is originally coming from and where it's going to;
from there you connect to an exit, which extends the circuit to the
destination. (The exit knows where the traffic goes to, but not know who
you are, it does know you IP).
The destination will see the IP address of the exit node instead of your
IP address. The exit IP address has been assigned by the ISP.
When you run Tor as a client only, the answer is no. "Run as a client
only." (default for the TorBrowserBundle, at least)
You can, however, relay traffic.
"Relay traffic inside the Tor network (non-exit relay)" would make you
an entry node and a middle node. Other clients connect to you and you
relay traffic to middle nodes. You relay traffic from entry nodes to
exit-nodes. Your IP address never "appears" on a destination, you never
connect to anything else as the Tor network itself. Please note that
your IP address will be listed in public. (That's how Tor works.)
Would require you to be online for a very long time.
"Relay traffic for the Tor network (exit relay)" would make you relay
traffic within the Tor network and connect to destinations. Then your IP
address "appears" on such destination.
Would require uptime and high bandwidth. It's not recommended to run an
exit node on an residential connection. Plus it's not recommended unless
you understand the consequences.
"Help censored users reach the Tor network" (aka Bridge) would make you
run a "hidden" entry node which IP address is not public. (Censored)
users request access to the Tor network and get your bridge address,
which contains your IP address to reach the network. Your IP address is
revealed to such users and of course the node you relay the traffic to
sees your IP address as well, but it could think you are a client,
because your IP address is not listed in public. You don't make
connections, outside the Tor network, for clients.
This relaying mode (Bridge mode) requires being online for a couple of
hours. Bandwidth is not important.
I hope I could help you.

You can use the TorBrowserBundle (TBB), it contains Tor and Vidalia. The
downside is you would have to launch the TorBrowser (Firefox with some
patches and addons) although you don't plan to use it as browser.
At the current state you have to start the browser and if you close it
Tor and Vidalia will exit. That was supposed to be changed so that Tor
and Vidalia would keep running and Tor could be used for other traffic
or just for (re-)starting the TorBrowser only when needed without
bootstrapping again.
All the other Vidalia Bundles (Bridge/Relay/Exit) contain Tor and
Vidalia. So you could download the Vidalia Bridge Bundle, install it and
change the settings in Vidalia* to be a client only. (If you aren't
comfortable with helping censored people or your system isn't up long
enough, or for what ever reason)
*Settings > [Sharing] > "Run as a client only"
Polipo was removed from the bundles. If your software requires a proxy
because it can't speak socks you can install it on your own. People
should be knowing what they are doing or use it for their special cases...
It can be started when Vidalia starts

You can pass arguments to the proxy if required.

@_subject: [tor-talk] about tor entry node 
esolve esolve:
A tor client picks three entry guards from the list of relays which got
the guard flag. The client sets an expiry time from 30-60 days; after
which it picks again. (It may do that earlier if Guards go down)
Around 900 entry guards out of 3000 relays.
See this graph:
Yes entry guards can be at any position in a circuit (if it also got the
exit flag). (Middle relays are just relays without guard and exit flags)
As much as I hope that they would be wrong... they are not. At least not
to my understanding. If someone, that might be the relay operator that
controls both entry and exit of a given circuit, or an adversary that
can look at the traffic of them, can see both ends he can correlate the
traffic. Based on timing information and traffic volume, for example.
Low latency networks such as Tor suffer from traffic correlation, which
has not been defeated yet. As far as I know this would be very hard to
accomplish, if at all.. (I'm not experienced enough with this topic.)
Entry Guards are one attempt to minimize the risk of being exposed to
traffic correlation. If the client picks three guards that are honest
(good guards), an attacker won't be able to correlate traffic, while it
would be more likely to pick a bad entry point if entry guards wouldn't
have been invented/introduced. (While there still is the case that a
client can pick bad guards)
To avoid building circuits over nodes that are controlled by the same
operator, operators can set a "Family" for their nodes, so the Tor
client would not pick them for the same circuit (also everything in the
same /16 IP block). Obviously the relay operators have to be honest as
this is an optional torrc setting and if your are a bad guy I guess you
wouldn't set it. (The other way around is not true; if it is not set
although it would be correct doesn't mean the relay operator is a bad guy)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Bandwidth in TOR 
Maimun Rizal:
A quote form the manual[1]:
"BandwidthRate N bytes|KB|MB|GB
A token bucket limits the average incoming bandwidth usage on this node
to the specified number of bytes per second, and the average outgoing
bandwidth usage to that same value. If you want to run a relay in the
public network, this needs to be at the very least 30 KB (that is, 30720
bytes). (Default: 5 MB)"
"BandwidthBurst N bytes|KB|MB|GB
Limit the maximum token bucket size (also known as the burst) to the
given number of bytes in each direction. (Default: 10 MB)"
"MaxAdvertisedBandwidth N bytes|KB|MB|GB
If set, we will not advertise more than this amount of bandwidth for our
BandwidthRate. Server operators who want to reduce the number of clients
who ask to build circuits through them (since this is proportional to
advertised bandwidth rate) can thus reduce the CPU demands on their
server without impacting network performance."
Relays observe peak bandwidth and store it in their state file.
A relay can advertise bandwidth it doesn't even have, therefor some
authorities measure the bandwidth of relays (bandwidth scanner)
I hope I could help you.

Don't have to be exact numbers, could be different colors or shades.

Compass can show all relays (can be restricted to exits) with the

Those metrics don't have to appear on the metrics page (although I

On Burningsilicon FF doesn't respond for 1-2 seconds (with the full list
of relays) while FF operates just fine on Google Maps. Google Maps loads
the list and displays the results a little faster, too. (at least for me).
Any map (yours on OSM, Google Maps; George's Tormap) is useful, detailed
and interactive. Each relay got it's icon and clicking it tells one
something about the relay.
I thought it would be too heavy (on resources) for torproject.org and
has dependencies like Google Maps or OSM, which I wouldn't like to include.
Having world map with icons per relay group (All, exit, maybe more)
followed by a number of relays fitting into the category. Clicking a
category (in a country) shows the list of relays fitting into that
category. From there one can click on any relay and see its stats (like
Atlas already does).
(or what ever is more useful, usable, lightweight on resources)
Pointing to [2] from Atlas for a more detailed map would be fine.
(Metrics points to some other domain for interactive graphs)
Sounds like Atlas would have the data to fulfill this request.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Safer Logging (by default) ? 
Hi there,
a the current state what can be logged by Tor could be called unsafe.
What I'm concerned about isn't the fact that one can tell Tor to log,
it's the safety that's unbalanced.
I never thought Tor logs should be appending as that could lead to
privacy issues whenever a relay gets raised. One turns on logging and
forgets about it. I never came up with it, but it's along the line.
- Make logs overwrite each other by default
(The node runs and starts logging, then stops running, when it starts
again it overwrites the old logs)
- Introduce an option to make logs appending (whenever this is reasonable)
Tor tells: [Notice] Tor can't help you if you use it wrong! Learn how to
be safe at Whenever logging is enabled Tor could tell: [Notice] Please log to an
safe place. Don't log unless it's serves an important reason.
Assign flags to nodes that log, maybe based on the level they do.
- log_warn
- log_error
- log_info
- log_debug
The TorProject and users could notice if a node is logging in a
suspicious way.
Maybe you can go as far as giving (long term or critical) logging nodes
less traffic. When equally good nodes exists they could be picked over
the logging ones.
I'm fully aware that one can log things without Tor, capture traffic and
all that stuff. The operators have to be honest.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is setting family an improvement to user safety? 
I guess there has been a design decision to implement bridges.
In the first place setting family reduces the amount of combinations
that could be picked for a circuit.
Outline: The Tor network has 6 nodes, they are all exits (entry, middle
and exit at the same time), there are no guards. All 6 nodes run on
different networks. 3 are run by the same person. 3 are run by an adversary.
Example one: no family has been set.
In the best case one uses only "good" nodes.
In the worst case one uses only "bad" nodes.
There's the chance one uses 2 "good" and 1 "bad".
There's the chance one uses 2 "bad" and 1 "good".
Example two: Family has been set by the honest guy (good nodes)
Now it's impossible to use only "good" nodes.
It's still possible to use only "bad" nodes. (Worst case)
In the best case one uses 2 "good" and 1 "bad".
It's still possible ones uses 2 "bad" and 1 "good".
Example three: Family has been set by both.
There's the chance one uses 2 "good" and 1 "bad".
There's the chance one uses 2 "bad" and 1 "good".
The bad case can't happen anymore. (The attacker plays to the rules)
Maybe it's an implementation that makes sense, as my example contains
only 6 nodes and 50 percent where controlled by an adversary.
Maybe it scales very well. And reduces the risk of hitting three bad
relays (of course there exist guards too). While it seems possible to
hit (the only) three bad ones even with 3000 good relays, that might be
just me. Also good and evil (bad) can't be told apart that easily.
Any comments about it? (I guess there's a reason for implementing it)
Please don't waste your time, you can point me somewhere or explain in
short sentences. "no it isn't because of the scaling there's no risk at

Chris Wheeler, 25.02.2012 18:06:
IMO not, since the first and last hop don't need to be compromised. An
attacker just needs to watch the traffic without being part of the
network. e.g. an ISP that hosts a bridge (or any other first hop) and
the exit. It's most likely that government will seek assistance from ISPs.
When I connect to a bridge an attacker could still see the traffic going
from my client through the exit. The only point is that bridges are not
listed so an attacker would need to know that I use a bridge.
A normal entry node is listed so an anyone could simply look if that IP
I'm connecting to is related to the Tor network. With bridges one needs
to know or guess that I'm using Tor.
I'm not sure how obfsproxy will affect the traffic flow.
Please note that I'm not involved in the Tor development process nor a
Tor official. You shall treat this as opinion/pov of a random dude.
Anyone with better knowledge should speak up and correct me.

Hi, there.
I got an idea on how bridge operators of "part-time bridges" could help
to make the experience of bridge users a little better.
It seemed like a good idea, until I thought that there might not be so
many bridges that could be called unstable.
However, I wrote it down anyway. Maybe it's not as useless as I think,
after "finishing" it. I thought about it longer, but put it together in
10 minutes. It's still rough, but more thinking doesn't seem to improve it.
Below I've pasted the Overview and Motivation. The full version is attached.
   This is about setting the estimated shutdown time of bridges,
   which could be set by bridge operators that don't have
   their bridges run 24/7
   It's an rough idea.
   Relays should run 24/7, while bridges don't have to.
   Unstable bridges can be a problem in terms of reachability.
   The user experience is bad when two of three bridges go offline.
   This should make disappearing bridges more predictable.
   It should prevent that one gets bridges that power of 5 minutes
   later.
BTW: Ideas dropped on the way (I thought about it and decided not to
write stuff down):
- Encrypt local data created by Tor
Good idea in the first place, but as I started to think about it I saw
more problems then benefit. (where to store the key or keys)
However I wanted to include this anyway. I guess there where thoughts on

I don't understand what works and what has to be done exactly. I'm not

needed to predict my changes to the specs.
It's written in the form of a proposal, but it should not be treated as
such. I just used this from to have something that helps to make it
cleaner compared to free form. It's an idea.
I started writing it down yesterday.
Below I've pasted the Overview and Motivation. The full version is attached.
   This is about compressing traffic at the exit, where it's passed from
   outside the network through other relays to the client where it
   gets decompressed.
   The compression should happen on the fly.
   This is NOT about which compression is actually used.
   It's an idea. It outlines what has to be done, but not how.
   The network has a high bandwidth usage due to it massive user-base.
   This idea should reduce the outgoing traffic of the exit and take
   much load from the mid-relay and the entry point.
   The relays (exit or not) have certain bandwidth limitations which may
   could be circumvented by compressing the traffic they have to handle,
   which would mean that they could handle more users.
   The main motivation is to improve the performance of the network,
   e.g. to serve more users and remove bottlenecks.

According to Andrew Lewmann lot's of stuff is already compressed. He

That would add CPU load to the exit, which hurts the network because the
exit can't handle that much onion-skins.
That could indeed save bandwidth, but only for popular sites. The cache
would have to be refreshed from time to time. Also this would require
space for the cached files. I'm sure that this would work.
This has nothing to do with compression IMO, just saving bandwidth.
You could post it as separate idea.
Keep in mind that the torproject knows it's requirements and that
bandwidth doesn't seem to be the problem.
I'm not sure if that would be used. When I'd use Tor for anonymity I
wouldn't want something to store anything on my behalf. ON the other
hand, when the website doesn't need to be fetched from it's original
server it might be harder to monitor for an adversary.
Yes, in my case the user requested compression if he could handle the
decompression, the sever could opt in or out.
The problem is that it causes that extra CPU load the exit can't afford.
That's included in mine as well, but the majority of exit are already
overloaded, so they would have to opt out, which makes compression
requests useless, because those won't be honored.
That was what I had in mind, but to quote Andrew:
"What tor does in the middle is irrelevant." (in terms of compression,
because it's already compressed)

Andrew Lewman, 26.03.2012 01:16:
The windows version of TBB ships with NoScript which is set to allow
scripts globally, but
"Forbid AUDIO/VIDEO"
"Apply these restrictions to whitelisted sites too"
are both enabled.
This means one has to click the object (this time a video) and answer

Elena Johnson, 10.05.2012 01:56:
The TorBrowserBundle (TBB) should allow scripting by default. It uses an
modified (aka patched) Firefox, which is re-branded to Tor Browser, and
ships with NoScript, which is set to allow JavaScript globally.
This has been done to avoid the problems you mentioned. TBB is modified
so that JavaScript shouldn't hurt anonymity.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Basic questions from new user but... 
Elena Johnson, 13.05.2012 00:38:
NoScript has a different goal, then Tor and therefore the TBB.
While NoScript aims to prevent malicious scripts from running by
disallowing scripts globally and only whitelist trusted sources; Tor
aims to give you control over your privacy/anonymity. TBB users share a
set of anonymity because they "look" similar.
Some sites require JavaScript to work, so it's expected that TBB users
would allow it. That's bad for their anonymity as an exit can
distinguish users that allow JS on particular site and those who don't.
An attacker that wants to track users that use TBB can set up a site and
load JavaScript from various resources, to see which users allow and
disallow a combination of them. That's the case for all filtering addons.
Also NoScript doesn't seem to be easily understood by non-technical
users. TBB should work out-of-the-box to be usable by anyone.
NoScript is still useful even when it's set to allow scripts globally.
So long story short
NoScript: Prevent an attacker from running JavaScript.
TBB: Make it possible to browse the web anonymously.
I haven't seen that you respond the Andrew's question so I just repeat
it here. Which version of TBB do you have? (Andrew's question) Also what
platform are you on? (me)

I used to be able to (mis)use the TorBrowserBundle's Tor to connect to
OFTC with PChat (Xchat fork). Note: I don't use the hidden-service.
It's some time since I visited the IRC channels, I don't know which TBB
It fails with "tor-browser-2.2.35-12_en-US" and with
"tor-browser-2.2.35-7.1_en-US". I also tried 0.2.3.15 alpha.
I always get:
* Connected. Now logging in...
* *** Looking up your hostname...
* *** Checking Ident
* *** No Ident response
* *** Found your hostname
That's not related to OFTC, since I get "No Ident response" on other IRC
services as well. Some even let me in.
OFTC however does not:
* Closing Link: [any exit name] (No more connections permitted from your
* Disconnected (Remote host closed socket).
I got and tried different exits as well.
Without Tor (any proxy) I can connect and get an Ident response.
Therefor I guess it is not the firewall.
I'm on Windows 7 (64bit) and PChat has not changed since I was able to
connect. tor-browser-2.2.35-7.1_en-US is from February 2012 and I was
only after that date. I use SSL but did so before.

Thank you for replying. It shouldn't be related to OFTC.
I get "No Ident response" from any IRC service I tried when I use Tor,
but without Tor I do.
I later checked if the reduced exit policy could be responsible for
that. Ident uses port 113 and it's not included in the reduced exit
policy, but that might be not the problem.
I don't know since when the reduced exit policy is in place, but I
edited the config (torrc) to use only "wau" as exit. It allows almost
any port, according to Atlas.

something the like. Since its bug tracker lives on torproject.org I ask
it here. Feel free to point me elsewhere.
According to the paper:
"... the badge is highly con?gurable for di?erent scenarios:
? Opt-in vs. opt-out: [...] The Flash object will only be served to
users who check the box. [...] Moreover, the badge itself can be
con?gured to only begin proxying after the visitor clicks on the badge.
? Geographic limitations: The badge can be con?gured to only serve
clients in certain geographies."
(I consider opt-out a bad idea, because it happens without being
expected, plus it is not recommended for TBB users so you never know if
one visit a website containing such a badge.)
How can it be achieved that the badge is only active after it has been
How can it be restricted to some geographies? (I'm just curious, don't
think it's something one would want)
Now I'm curios what happens if...? Most can be attributed to the lack of
knowledge of WebSockets.
What happens if I visit two websites that have the badge on them? (I'm
trying to be a proxy twice?, It breaks something?)
Does it affect the proxy state when I open a website with the badge on
it, open a link to the same website (but different page while every page
has the badge on it) in a new tab (or window) and close the original tab
(or window)?
(Does it break connections? Fetches [polling] requests again?)
What if I open multiple windows with multiple tabs? (or huge amount of
tabs in one window)
(Are too many connections to crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/embed bad?)
What happens if one opens multiple browsers (FF, TBB, FF Portable,
Opera, Chrome, Safari, IE, or any other) and visits a website containing
such a badge (or multiple websites with such a badge)?
The last question is mostly out of curiosity, but this may happen in
real life situations.
Be aware answering these questions could lead to more questions.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Flashproxy questions. (Badge config, 
David Fifield:
Thank you for the detailed information.
My question wasn't precise enough. As far as I understand it now, a
website owner (admin) can't choose between opt-in and opt-out, right?
I assumed that
iframe ="//crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/embed.html" width="80"
height="15" frameborder="0" scrolling="no">
will be a badge that is running on the users end (opt-out).
My question was how an admin can achieve to have be opt-in? (Now I
understand that doesn't seem possible.)
Couldn't you have
to make it possible to choose between them?
My concern about opt-out was that someone else decides for anybody else.
An admin decides for the visitors. Although the proxy might be idle most
of the time and a visitor is not affected I would find it problematic to
have it opt-out by default.
For crypto.stanford.edu it did not concern me as I read.
"If your browser runs JavaScript and has support for WebSockets then
while you are viewing this page your browser is a potential proxy
available to help censored Internet users."
For some people it may be suspicious that there browser is doing
something without their consent. I expect a browser to display web pages
and not to relay traffic.
It's also hard to figure out how many people would care to click the
badge when it's opt-in. I hadn't any good idea to make people aware of
the proxy and that the could help, without annoying them.
It's also hard to figure out how admins will react to opt-out. Users may
overlook the badge or don't care at all so the admin assumes it would be
a good idea to do it that way.
I saw the update to exclude Tor exits from being served. And think this
is a good idea. Mostly because it catches Tor + any browser (not
recommended) and TBB.
TBB users should look all the same, but how they look changes from TBB
release to TBB release I assume. Would be not so good to have something
to fingerprint it on.
Once the flashproxy is not relaying Tor over Tor, the anonymity attacks
shouldn't be a problem to have opt-out from that point of view.
Knowledge is power. I didn't know what would happen so I asked.
It's easier to explain it to both sides (admins and visitors) if you
know how it works.
I don't seem to have questions for now, but I will come back and ask for
more. Thank you for explaining so nicely.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Porn make the world more free: Tor Porn Bundle? 
Fabio Pietrosanti (naif):
Since the current TBB can display images I assume that watching videos
is the goal of the Porn-TBB.
There was the (unanswered?) question (on tor-talk) if not all users
should consume their porn through Tor to avoid people sticking out,
because they have to use Tor to access it or if this would be bad for
the network.[1]
I assume that the load (no pun intended) would lead to congestion which
could hurt anonymity of other users. Well still better than
bulk-downloading. I also assumed that if all Facebook users suddenly
start using Tor to access Facebook the network would suffer from the
amount of traffic. (I have not validated any of my assumptions)
Tor might be already very unwanted in the "Arab World" because it allows
access to information that are also unwanted. Porn is one step further
and might them try to ban or block Tor even harder. ("Protect our
children from porn!")
They probably have something called imagination which could serve to
satisfy the need. Pictures (of naked ankles and naked angles[*]) should
be in reach with the current TBB.
(I'm not arguing against PTBB)
Are there any websites distributing their porn via HTML5 video? (A,
"Yes, there are!" would be enough, no links) Otherwise Flash will be
used and if they use the Porn TBB to access other information
anonymously Flash could shoot them in the foot.
On Youtube you have to opt-in for HTML5-video. They deliver Flash by
default. So I assume it's not wide-spread enough.
Maybe convincing porn websites to distribute their content via HTML5 (if
not already the case) would be helpful to this goal.
Some exit nodes run by the "porn industry" would be nice.
[*] To some both is equally bad from their religious point of view.

I wanted to learn what consensus methods are. Below the desired

"Before generating a consensus, an authority must decide which consensus
method to use. To do this, it looks for the highest version number
supported by more than 2/3 of the authorities voting. If it supports
this method, then it uses it. Otherwise, it falls back to method 1."
Let's say more than 2/3 support "14" and one supports "13". The last one
wouldn't use "14" because it does not support it, but why would it fall
back to "1"?
Well it makes sense that some don't use "14" if more than 2/3 only
support "13". Therefor "falling back" on "13" is fine.
In other words. Why doesn't the one that supports "13" use "13"? The
authority could decide that "14" > "13" and safely use "13".

I don't know if they appear in the correct order. (I just never looked

Circuits change over time (usually 10 minutes) so the information (IP
address) could be older.
It also can happen that exits have multiple IP addresses and the circuit
connects to one IP while the exit itself is configured to use another IP
for outbound connections.
I don't know that. If anything you'll see the middle relay and where the
traffic is flowing to. I don't know if Tor is providing these
information so Vidalia could show them.
However it's indeed possible to see which relay connects to you and
where your computer is connecting to. Some firewalls may show it.
Exits aren't supposed to know much. (I'd hope the wouldn't care much)
Please note that it's not recommended to run an exit on an connection
that carries your own traffic, because you could be accused for stuff
you didn't do.

Made me think that if one declares family for the entire network except
his/her own nodes he would see the full path. At least he/she would be
in an excellent position for end-to-end correlation, provided his/her
nodes got the Guard and Exit flag(s).
Quote from dir-specification (2.1)
""family" [...]
If two ORs list one another in their "family" entries, then OPs should
treat them as a single OR for the purpose of path selection.
For example, if node A's descriptor contains "family B", and node B's
descriptor contains "family A", then node A and node B should never be
used on the same circuit."
Seems to explain it better; like I would expect it to work. Only if two
relays declare family with each other they will be excluded from being
in the same path.
I hope that my understanding is correct. Please tell me if it is NOT.
(Thank you in advance)
Would it make sense to clarify it in the path-specification?
I mean I assumed it would work in the way that "A" AND "B" declare
family with each other and if they do they get excluded form the same
path, rather than just "A" declaring family with "B" leading to the same
result. I looked into the path-specification, but didn't get
enlightened. A, for me, understandable explanation was "hidden" in the
dir-specification as I didn't expect to find something about families in it.
It could be just me since I'm not a native speaker. For a native speaker
it might be most likely clear that "same family" implies both relays
agreeing on that, while for me it can say that, but doesn't have to.

I'd like to see a different approach, a different design. Most preferred
would be a well documented public timeline. Even if it fails there might
be good things coming out of it and who says it is going to fail.
I currently don't buy into "The solution is to not publicize relay
servers.", but the Tor people state:
"Requiring every client to know about every router won't scale forever."
"Requiring every directory cache to know every router won't scale forever."
The above are quotes from the dir-spec (0.3)
so there might be something the Tor people could learn from you,

About assassinating (double ass) the (core?) Tor people....
I have read that you can hire assassins on hidden-services. Wouldn't it
be ironic if one hires an assassin (or many of them) via hidden-services
to take the lives or Tor people?
They tend to pile up on something they call developers meeting (aka
DevMeeting). It's kind of public when and where such a meetings will
take place and who will attend to them.
The US owns drones (and they love to use them), European states buy also
drones so if someone gets accused for treason, which is probably Mr.
Jacob Appelbaum because of his relation to wikileaks, while Tor is also
a threat such a meeting would be a juicy target. With someone killed for
treason or terrorism (or supporting it) the other dead bodies are just
collateral damage.
That doesn't scare me. I'd never want that to happen.
If it doesn't look like an accident (in this case or any other) people
will notice about them missing or being killed. I hope that people will
fight murders.
Tor might be dead, but people will be upset about the death of innocent
What's more concerning is that they could back-door Tor, all it takes is
to turn one developer around, let anyone know about the back-door and
people will loose trust. That could kill Tor as well.

Querying Onionoo isn't that user friendly. The summary is understandable
to me, the bandwidth document is not. Well it was never made for

It can handle nickname, but doesn't like "nickname" (with quotes "").
Indeed it would be awesome to have support for bridges. Wanting and
being able to are to different animals (two different pairs of shoes,
for the Germans).
JavaScript and CSS are code, too. There might be the possibility that I
understand what it does in general, but it appears to be unlikely that I
understand what it does in detail or that I could reproduce it. It is
also another step from reproducing something to successfully changing
something or building something new.
When I'm providing a patch Atlas might even show the real IP addresses
of bridges even if Onionoo doesn't have them. ;)

Hello list/George,
one runs a "normal" bridge and wants to turn it into an (py)obfsproxy

By using the file from the alpha Pluggable Transports Bundle (\Data\)
one can do that.
I copied the content of \Data\ to another folder and removed the files
that are already provided by the bridge bundle as well as the Flash
proxy files. The question is: which files are required to run Obfsproxy?
I attach a list of files that remain in the folder. The list has a
trailing space in front of each line. I marked the files I know to be
required with an "x" in front.
My assumption is that .pyd belong to Obfsproxy, but they also could be
related to Flash proxy.
The reason for this question is that there's no bridge bundle for
Windows that would let you run Obfsproxy (and Flash Proxy) out of the
box as far as I know. See  And it seems rather easy to run an
Obfsproxy bridge on Windows, when you just copy the required files over

How is it possible to use a publicly unknown exit, which should have no

by unmodified clients?
(I'm assuming that a client would only use exits if they are exits in
the consensus.)
Well, a bridge with an exit-policy won't be used as exit, even if
SingleHop is allowed. Or am I wrong?
(I remember that this is the case, since a bridge would see what a
client uses Tor for and is not bound by the Guard implementation)

Note quite global, but at important places. Not sure how fine-grained it is.
As it seems this was not the fault of the 'hidden service system', most
likely one hidden-service failed due to the software that was used,
which lead to the takedown of all hidden-services affiliated with the

David Fifield:
Have not tested it, yet.
How does the Tor client know which transport it should use?
"If two plugins support the same method, Tor should use whichever one is
listed first"
They don't support the *same* method. So does it build circuits with
both at the same time? (Different circuits for different transports)
The bundle extractor is 32bit software, but flash proxy and obfsproxy
are indeed 64bit software. The bundle will not work on 32bit builds of
Windows. Windows XP (although dated) is still very far spread and mostly
32bit (There's a 64 build of it). Vista was 32bit and 64bit as well as
Windows 7. I believe there are 32bit builds for Windows 8.
Many people won't be able to use it.
On Windows you can run 32bit software with an 64bit operating system,
until Microsoft changes this. (Like they did with 16bit software)
Windows 8 64bit runs 32bit software if I'm not mistaking.
So if it's a resource (time) thing, it's probably better to have a 32bit
Do you plan to create a 32bit bundle?
I don't know much about the platform and its underlying architecture.
Are there many 32bit operating systems? Does 32bit software run on 64bit
OS Xs? Maybe it be nicer to have a 32bit bundle for that platform as well.

If you talk about DHT (distributed hash tables) to bootstrap rather than
fetching the consensus from a central place or a mirror... I remember
that it wasn't safe enough back at that time. I don't know if anyone is
working on it.
If that's for the relay list, probably not so useful. Censors could
still put them back together. Every client has to know about the
network. All an attacker would have to do is run a client and block
every IP:PORT it finds in the consensus.
And the list of relays is available. Projects of the Tor Project show
currently running relays.
If that's for unlisted relays aka bridges, it exists to some degree. The
pool of bridges is split and different addresses are given out via
email, website and manually.
If I'm not mistaking Torservers.net operates bridges that don't publish
themselves to the BridgeDB.
The are bundles containing obfsproxy and flash proxy to work around
It separates the user base. It is also a malware problem. I haven't seen

As far as my understanding goes this could hinder website fingerprinting

Obviously only if it is applied, which might be not the case since it
tries to be adaptive and would create a second{ary} circuit only if

("With the introduction of bridges ? unadvertised Tor routers that
provide Tor access to users within censored regimes like China ?
low-bandwidth Tor routers are becoming more common and essential to
Tor?s ability to resist censorship.")
(The logic appeared flawed to me. Bridge relays are a problem of people
that use them. Since bridge relays don't take any other position as the
first hop ? for bridge users only ? they don't affect the rest of the
network. Low-bandwidth routers would exist without bridges, unless the
authorities enforce a certain amount of bandwidth. The commonness of
low-bandwidth routers in the network does not depend on bridges.
Low-bandwidth bridges may become more common or are already more common,
what likely depends on the fact that it's easier to contribute a bridge
than a relay from home, due to different requirements. Also bridges are
needed in high quantities since this is part of the censorship evasion,
which is also why the bridges are there in the first place.)
(Those bridges get more common and are essential to the diversity of the
user-base Tor has.)

Tor's partial slowness.)

14.07.2013 20:28, Mike Perry:
Would it be possible to measure bridges without making an observer know
it's a bridge? A central server connecting to bridges to measure their
bandwidth would reveal - by looking at a single server - that they are
bridges, not just clients, wouldn't it?
A decentralized approach would require multiple trusted members and
would still reveal the location of bridges, right?
Bridges could perform self-tests including measuring their own bandwidth
and include the results in their descriptors. What does the bridge
download and upload to test the bandwidth? Where are those files
located? Clients don't do this, so seeing it would let me conclude
there's a bridge running.
Bridge distribution is in general pretty difficult. (It appears to be
the case to me.)
Users don't get that many bridges, they are not in the position to base
their paths on the bandwidth of bridges. BridgeDB handing out faster
bridges more often could mean that those get blocked faster, what makes
it far from ideal, I guess.
Pluggable Transports would require measurement as well and handing out
their information would face the same problems. (Getting out fast enough
ones that also work).

15.07.2013 08:39, Gabrielle DiFonzo:
When you download a PDF document over Tor you get the properties you
expect from Tor (e.g. being anonymous to the server hosting the PDF). If
you then open the PDF document, while still being Online, with Adobe
Acrobat Reader (or any other reader), while not having the reader
configured to use Tor it could be the case that the PDF document
contains a resource that is located on a server (maybe the server you
downloaded it from, maybe another) and Tor gets bypassed.
The server logs show someone downloads 'cryptonite.pdf' and the IP
address tells the server operator that it belongs to a Tor Exit (public
information). Ten seconds later the server logs show a request for a
picture embedded in above PDF document, this time with another IP
address, which is ultimately yours. The server operator can tell that
the IP address does not belong to Tor and conclude it is yours.
This broke your anonymity.
This can affect a lot of files. I can affect PDFs, but you can't tell if
it is safe or not. Word documents can contain external resources as
well. WMA and WMV (WindowsMediaAudio) (WindowsMediaVideo) can contain
DRM information which are checked against a server. I'm not sure if this
applies to MP3s, but I guess that this is possible.
For whatever you download over Tor and open while being Online you face
the risk of your anonymity being broken.
Files that are present because you create them or downloaded them
without Tor are not safe to upload somewhere as they could contain
information about you.
For opening them while using Tor you could face identity correlations.

it allows more fine grained timing information)

If one redirects all traffic through Tor and software contacts its
companies server to ask for updates it may include information that
reveal the system or the individual that purchased/registered this software.
The printer itself is not asking for updates unless you look for new
drivers, which is not part of the printers responsibility, but the OS.
Regarding firmware updates I think its unlikely that a printer will
check, since users are not supposed to do firmware upgrades.
Printer software (scan tool, PDF-converter, etc. is just software and
may checks for updates as well.
Probably not. If your AV product comes with an cloud-scanning service,
it may upload the files or information about them to the vendors server.
If you download files over Tor your AV vendor could get knowledge about it.
Firefox and TorBrowser have a setting to invoke the system AV solution
to scan a downloaded file. This option is currently turned on in both,
this will be disabled in TorBrowser. However most AV solutions scan new
files anyway. (They hook into the system and scan what's written.)
Obviously it is software again, and since everything on Windows has to
use its custom solution to retrieve updates it will connect to the
Internet and tell its update server what signature version it got.
Suppose you use a special software that is very uncommon and it updates
over Tor. This would allow a malicious exit to know when you use Tor.
(Only you use this software over Tor, so only your software makes Tor
exit nodes communicate with the update server)
The TorBrowserBundle is designed to leave less traces. However the
TorBrowserBundle is not cleaning up anything. You might be interested in
Runa's analysis [1][PDF]. It covers Windows, Linux and Mac.
It does not hurt to run a software that cleans up traces and clear the
logs. It depends on your threat model. If it is critical to hide the
fact that you ran TorBrowserBundle (or just Tor) then it is an option.
Please note that if someone who inspects your machine will most likely
notice that you cleared the logs and erased traces. Also he could alter
your system and backdoor it.
Tor is a low latency anonymity network. Remailers like Mixminion are
high latency. Tor has to be low latency in order to be useful for most
people. Browsing the web is more painful as latency becomes higher. You
would probably not want to wait minutes for your website to appear.
Real-time communication requires low latency as well. Checking mails
however is not that time critical and works with higher latency.

With Tor you can visit the website, preferably with the

A torrent site usually offers only .torrent files, which are tiny and
can be downloaded over Tor (with TBB), your specific example does not
even do that. There are no files to download (beside the website itself

Using a torrent client with Tor is not recommended as the client
probably leaks. Also it would add a constant, massive load to the Tor

to participate early. The earliest questions set the tone and topic of

Twitter, blogs, and email far and wide. If the site does not get used,
it will be deleted." ~ FAQ excerpt
It gets deleted if it doesn't get used. Although I know this is in an
early state and I don't think it's likely to get kicked there is the
possibility for this to happen.
Now to the Guidelines for Beta (and leaving beta).
I had asked this on stackexchange already. [2]
- Questions per day
"15 questions per day on average is a healthy beta, 5 questions or fewer
per day needs some work. A healthy site generates lots of good content
to make sure users keep coming back."
I think most relevant questions will be asked at some point. I also
think it's better to have answers before the questions get even asked.
It appears to be more healthy if all questions of a user are answered
and he/she hasn't to come back.
- Answered questions in percent
"90% answered is a healthy beta, 80% answered needs some work. In the
beta it's especially important that when new visitors ask questions they
usually get a good answer."
No objection to this point from my side.
- Avid users vs. total users
"Every site needs a solid group of core users to assist in moderating
the site. We recommend:
    150 users with 200+ rep
    10 users with 2,000+ rep
    5 users with 3,000+ rep"
Maybe doable, but there are probably more new users asking, than "older"
sticking around and answering them.
Beside the Tor Support team and some community members there might be a
fresh supply of new users that don't stick around.
- Answer ratio
"2.5 answers per question is good, only 1 answer per question needs some
work. In a healthy site, questions receive multiple answers and the best
answer is voted to the top."
I think questions answered by Tor Assistants or people close to Tor wont
need another answer. In general, for many questions regarding any topic,
I think answers should be given in such a way to create the maximum
possible outcome.
For example, related to Tor, a question about the supported
OS/device/platform could be answered with all platforms supported by Tor
and forks/alternatives for, let us say, Android etc..
Is it desirable to fit to a metric that prefers multiple answers instead
of a solid answer whenever possible? I understand that not every
question will be satisfied with one answer, but why put it in numbers?
I also understand that this is the risk/nature of Q&A where the peers
up-vote the answer they most like or think is correct, which might not
be the case. Ending up with the up-voted answer that the Earth is flat
is a risk for any Q&A system, but telling the highest answer is the best
is quite dangerous as many people can be wrong.
The majority can be wrong. "Read through all answers given and decide
which one(s) appear plausible to you and if you can validate them."
- visits per day
"1,500 visits per day is good, 500 visits per day needs some work. A
great site benefits people outside the community. Eventually, 90% of a
site's traffic should come from search engines."
I don't know how many visits there will be in the end. (It's far to
early). I don't object to the point.
Might be a reason to delete the Q&A, I don't know.
The concern I tried to raise is that the Q&A sticks in Beta forever,
which is like having the "Sword of Damocles" hanging above ones head (or
cupboard in my case). It could be deleted.
Maybe this is not too concerning, but needs to be considered. They who
pay the bills get to say what to do, I guess.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Third-party Q&As 
I'd like to raise concerns about third-party Q&As and discuss them.
This is independent from stackexchange. (I don't mind using stackexchange)
Points regarding third-party operated and/or hosted Q&As
- No server costs
- No bandwidth costs
- No installing or updating software
- Little or no set-up time
- Censors might not block the Q&A while TPO is blocked
- Q&A staff helps out (might or might not be the case)
- Fees (might or might not be the case)
- No encryption (might or might not be the case)
- No control about personal data
- No control about advertising
- No control about data-mining, tracking
- Could be gone
 -> Deleted, because of $reason
 -> Filed for bankruptcy
 -> Bought by Google, then shut down
- Tor could be banned by the service
- Rules can change
 -> No anonymous questions allowed anymore
 -> If you search more than two question you have to register
Maybe there's more, but this is probably enough to discuss about and
raise general awareness.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Plans about Askbot? 
to get this nice and clean a third topic.
No further topic regarding Q&A will follow today.
You had ask.TPO with Askbot already running and it is still running. All
it seems to take is an active community that feeds it with questions and
answers them.
Do you plan to use Stackexchange instead?
Why did no one ask to make a Q&A happen with Askbot?
Was the decision for stackexchange made in a rush?
Askbot is live for a couple of months, while the proposal at
Stackexchange is 3-4 days old.
If it was rushed, why was it rushed?
Why is Stackexchanged favored? / Why is Askbot dismissed?
Why wasn't there a discussion?
The reason I ask these questions is that you have Askbot and all it
needs are people. All of a sudden Stackexchange comes around and is
"pushed". Stackexchange is complicated as there's a process you have to
go through and it's a third-party and... It just doesn't make any sense
to me.
Additionally this is about "transparency". The Tor Project should be all
about "transparency" if it doesn't endanger anyone or is of private or
internal nature. It affects the community and if you want people
participating you probably should be more informative.
Not to say that this is a community decision, the Tor Project has to
make the final decision, but some statements to inform the community and
let the community discuss the decision(s) or statement(s) would have
been appropriate, I think.

Hi Moritz,
I'm not sure what you disagree with.
That there are not enough resources?
That it is better to have some Q&A than none?
I share adrelanos's opinion that it is better to have some Q&A then none.
Assuming it is actually helpful to people, of course.
I'm not in the position to argue about the resources necessary or
available, because I have no clue of both.
Call me naive, but the same people will answer the questions regardless
of the service that is used. In theory the Q&A should be self-governing
and only software updates should be required.
I agree that the Tor devs shouldn't have to worry. They should care
about producing working code and designs for the future.
I don't know how much the community could contribute.
Let's hope the comment [1] turns out to be wrong.
"I doubt the Tor Q&A page will take off,(...)."

23.03.2013 19:31, Christian Sturm:
thank you for creating an addon for this.
There's a spelling mistake for the German description.
"Warhscheinlich hilfe ein Neustart von Firefox."
should be
"Wahrscheinlich hilft ein Neustart von Firefox."
I don't know if it's Mozilla or Firefox, but XPIs are meant to be
installed. Right click and "Save as.." doesn't work. You have to use
another browser to download the xpi in order to inspect it.
Nothing personal. I can't read code and would not notice anything
strange, although I wouldn't expect anything nasty inside.
Do you know if the folder "addon-sdk" is required? It's the largest part
of the addon.
I gave it a try and it works fine I guess.
The addon appears to set a cookie for the path
while the options page set a cookie for the path
This makes it impossible to disable the proxy on its option page. Since
your cookie contains a "1" all the time. The cookie from the option page
might be "1" or "0", while "0" gets ignored if your cookie is also present.
According to the addon "addons memory" it takes around 5.60 MB of
memory. Can this be optimized?
I loaded the website of flashproxy into a tab and turned it into an "App
Tab". It's there all the time an "survives" restarting, just the cookie
is missing. I find this approach appealing, but guess that an addon is
more appealing to most people. Might be even more appealing than the
standalone-flashproxy that is being worked on, since I'd forget about
starting it after some time and I'm not a fan of starting everything on
It's strange that I'm the only one that replied so far.

example, if none of the exits you list allows traffic on port 80 or 443,
you won?t be able to browse the web.
Note also that not every circuit is used to deliver traffic outside of
the Tor network. It is normal to see non-exit circuits (such as those
used to connect to hidden services, those that do directory fetches,
those used for relay reachability self-tests, and so on) that end at a
non-exit node. To keep a node from being used entirely, see ExcludeNodes

The ExcludeNodes option overrides this option: any node listed in both

17.11.2013 14:01, SimBlip at aol.com:
Order changed
If you download the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) for your system and
"install" it, then just the traffic from the contained browser goes
trough Tor.
The "old" way of installing Tor for the browser on the system is no
longer recommended as it is somewhat unsafe. The browser in TBB is a
patched and modified Firefox.
BTW: It's spelled Tor rather than TOR.
Some websites or services have policies that disallow circumvention of
bans. If they find out, this can result in another ban.
If the service allows Tor (which can be blocked by those that run the
service) and checks if your IP is banned which could be case if it is a
static one, (For some people they are, I think for most they are
dynamic.) the circumvention would work. With Tor the usage of Tor itself
if not hidden to the location you are connecting to, the location can
not tell where the traffic is actually coming from.
With the use of TBB (strongly recommended) you avoid that they placed a
cookie, that marks you as banned. (Some services set a cookie for a
banned account, so that someone with the same browser does not create a
new account without removing the cookie; aka cookie_of_death). It also
avoids that they might have fingerprinted your browser, what might not
be common, but would be possible.
Using a new identity would require you to use a new email address, as
well. It might look suspicious if someone got banned and a new user
appears, that uses Tor, while no-one else does and that does the same
things, like asking questions about how to feed cats properly (assuming
it's a forum about animal care).
Tor gets you location anonymity. Someone watching your connection does
not learn where you are going to, someone watching the endpoint doesn't
know who is connecting to it, if the new account does not link to you
personally. What you do with your gained anonymity is yours, I guess.

This reply is made without having read (at least recently, if ever) any
article or paper linked by any one participating on this topic, but I
will do that at some later point. (Usually the weekend)
Let me say that I think that the world need a distributed voting system
deployed and proven in practice. (Sealed envelope, commit-reveal)
Below you said you'd have A (distributed voting) or B (external string),
right below this text, here, you say 'dependency'.
I wouldn't consider it a good idea to depend on something that may goes
away. I considered it as addition. (more down below)
I tend to introduce complexity by thinking to complex at times.
I'm agnostic about the source of the string if it's provable, that it is
not predictable, not modifiable or only at high cost.
In the case of bitcoin, which was used as an example because nothing
else popped into my head, I didn't consider to include bitcoin into Tor.
I considered the authorities building circuits to one or more
websites/public resources to fetch the hash for a given time. Nothing
that would require huge amounts of code.
Beside bitcoin, space-weather data might be published by multiple
sources. Unpredictable, unchangeable fluctuations in the brightness of
the sun...
All those questions, wherever the 'numbers' are coming from would have
to be answered for each one of the sources. Indeed, something for
experts, in their individual filed, to think about, I guess.
As you've noticed (second email) it's related to the mining.
Good question. Beside cosmological events nothing else I could come up
with so far.
I intended to walk you though my mind to show you why I wanted to
combine them, but that doesn't seem to be required.
If you have a "random global external secure string" and you pick that
before you get the "distributed voting/number generation* going the
subverted parties might be able to game this. So from that perspective
you are right, I think.
Let's consider the bitcoin hash as "random global secure string", just
as example. If you'd include that into the consensus and for some reason
bitcoin starves suddenly, because no ones is mining (or any other
reason), you are were you started. Therefore I'm not for including
something that might go away.
I considered a basic voting scheme (public voting), where each party
votes (oversimplified) for either 1 or 0 and if there's a tie it's
always 1 (or 2). The last voting party can possibly decide if it prefers
1 or 0. In this case adding a number that is unknown to any voting party
after they voted would prevent that. It appears to be correct that
voting is unnecessary if the number can not be influenced or predicted.
I can't come up with a case, right now, where it would make sense to
have "commit-and-reveal" and "external string". I just thought there
would be a case, but I guess there's not, unless it is unclear how much
influence a modified "external string" actually has on the final result.
(So where an adversary can't tell what the string has to be and what the
authorities do commit.)

I think the tricky part is to prove that such a string would be secure.
It's broken when the string is broken. In our case if bitcoin has a
cryptographic weakness the resulting hash might be unsuitable.
I would have to start reading the protocol and had no intention in doing
so. (I don't think this would be helpful)
I think this is the case, but it's about math so there's the possibility
that I got/get it wrong.

It's kind of both. You can "install" the bundle. The .exe can be
executed and asks for where to extract to and can optionally start the
bundle after extracting it.
It's also possible to extract the "installer" using 7zip (or another
extractor) and access it that way. (This applies to the relay bundle and
bridge bundle, too. They are installers and can be extracted using 7zip
or something else.)
Apparently users are confused all the time. They were confused about
simple archives one had to extract. They extracted it and did not know
what to do. Now it is an executable that unpacks the bundle and can
launch it.
This should be a lot easier to handle for most people.
They had, but users seemed confused.
Indeed, some security mechanism filer attachments based on extension.
I would get confused if something that can't be executed would have the
extension .exe and if that would be the case with TBB releases I would
also prefer to have a .zip file as it doesn't require third-party
software on modern windows, which as far as I can tell still does not
know how to handle .7z

just archives or version for 64bit Windows, maybe one can do that anyway

@_subject: [tor-talk] Regarding #8244; 
beside having each authority call in for their vote about the random
string, how about including a string in the consensus not under control
by any authority?
For example a hash from the bitcoin blockchain (its popular and I had no
other source in mind). The authorities get together at some point, lets
say 10 minutes before each full hour. They all take the hash from
hh:45:00 or the closest to that result, where the newest wins. (hh:46:00
wins over hh:44:00)
Clients and hidden-services use both the hash and the random string.
If for whatever reason an authority picks a different hash than the
others there is no error. Like with all(?) other votes the majority
wins, so the majority would need to be buggy or compromised in order to
vote for the 'desired' hash.
The bitcoin blockchain is observable and so it is known where the hash
in the consensus comes from. Anyone could see which hash is included
look it up in the blockchain and see if it matches the criteria that
were specified for selecting the hash.
I'm unsure if that solves the case where a single authority can
influence the result to a desired outcome. I think a non-voting
authority will have an influence on the random string, but to what
degree could it benefit a malicious authority not to vote? Authorities
that drop out of the consensus seem to happen every now and then.
I'm not sure how many time an authority has to calculate the outcome it
desired. It can know the hash 5 minutes before it gets picked, wait for
all the other authorities to vote for their part on the random string
and then compute what it has to vote for to get a string that has the
desired properties and vote.
If the time for an authority to game this is too high, how about voting
for the random string as soon as possible, then after all authorities
voted in time, those that didn't are ignored, the next (upcoming) hash
of the bitcoin blockchain is included, unless there is none within a
given timeframe (as one can not guarantee that there will be a new block
while voting) in which case the latest available hash will be used.
So instead of picking the hash first, then vote doing it the other way
I'm not sure if that's too complex, although to me it sounds easy. I
mean I could think of it so it shouldn't give anyone with a
cryptographic background headache to think this one through.
I've read the thesis and tried to understand the text parts. Having a
temporary secret so that each authority doesn't know what any other
authority voted for until the time for voting is up sounds very safe to me.

03.09.2013 17:35, adrelanos:
Beside an existing botnet that now makes use of Tor (rising clients due
to updates) or a new botnet (new infections increase the number of the
clients) that includes Tor thoughtlessly, this is a valid concern.
What if that is an attempt to use (or create) a botnet to stress the
network to a level that makes it useless?
It may start slowly to see what the network can handle. I guessed that
an adversary would have an interest in making bridges unusable, which
could be accomplished by the new clients.
Due to the fact the Tor Project itself showed how well or not so well
the bridge distribution scales [1] it surprised me that adversaries that
are just bothered by bridges did not ran an attack, yet.
If it's really someone trying to shut it down they'll might test how
many bootstrapping users the network can handle, before turning them
into bridges (thus making BridgeDB very upset [1]) and make them push
some traffic, which results in totally overused relays.
Let's hope that it's just another botnet that happens to use Tor.
It looks unnatural to me, too. The clients came overnight and are still
increasing. Apparently all around the world, with the exception of one
I would expect new users, because of events that either force them to
use Tor or makes them willing to use Tor. The NSA spying would have been

leaked out. It looks like all around the world people decided to use Tor

I created ticket  [2] to have something to open the log, at least
and you picked "TorBrowserButton" as component (I left it empty).
Your ticket description [1] says:
"TBB 3.0 currently has a button to copy Tor logs to the clipboard"
Since your ticket summary asks for what thought would be a good idea and
mine was about doing something to be able to access the log, did mine
become obsolete?
With other words should I close my ticket [2]?
I was unaware of this function.
I even thought: Where is the button? "TorBrowserButton" has it under
"Open Network settings".
Do you think it should be accessible in the browser (that was what I
asked for and hoped for being able to copy it), rather than having to
paste it somewhere to read it?

@_subject: [tor-talk] NIST approved crypto in Tor? 
Tor switches over to ECC what's a reasonable step.
I'm unable to find the blog post (or maybe it was an official comment on
the blog) [With DDG and StartPage] where someone said that if the NIST
(I guess) is not lying ECC is safe.
Is the ECC used by Tor in some way certified by NIST?
Are other parts of Tor certified by NIST?
Recent leaks revealed that the NSA spends many resources in influencing
standards to make their lives easier (or not too hard). NIST could be
either participating or tricked into preferring standards that are weak
in some regard. Note that I'm not saying that this is the case, but it
could be.
I was able (it was not a blog post, it was an essay) to find what Bruce
Schneier wrote about the NSA preferring a weak random-number-generator. [1]
Quotes [my comments, notes]:
"The U.S. government released a new official standard for random-number
generators this year [essay from 2007], and it will likely be followed
by software and hardware developers around the world."
"(...) the 130-page document contains four different approved
techniques, called (...) "Deterministic Random Bit Generators." All four
are based on existing cryptographic primitives. One is based on hash
functions, one on HMAC, one on block ciphers and one on elliptic curves."
" (...) one of those generators (...) Dual_EC_DRBG [elliptic], (...)
three orders of magnitude slower than its peers."
" It's in the standard only because it's been championed by the NSA,
which first proposed it years ago in a related standardization project
at the American National Standards Institute."
"The math is complicated, but the general point is that the random
numbers it produces have a small bias. [2006 knowledge]"
"But today [2007] there's an even bigger stink brewing around
Dual_EC_DRBG" (...) Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson showed that the
algorithm contains a weakness that can only be described as a backdoor."
"There are a bunch of constants -- fixed numbers -- in the standard used
to define the algorithm's elliptic curve. These constants are listed in
Appendix A of the NIST publication, but nowhere is it explained where
they came from."
" (...) these numbers have a relationship with a second, secret set of
numbers (...). If you know the secret numbers, you can predict the
output of the random-number generator after collecting just 32 bytes of
its output. (...) you only need to monitor one TLS internet encryption
connection in order to crack the security of that protocol. If you know
the secret numbers, you can completely break any instantiation of
"The researchers don't know what the secret numbers are. (...) the way
the algorithm works, the person who produced the constants might know;
he had the mathematical opportunity to produce the constants and the
secret numbers in tandem."
" (...) we have no way of knowing whether the NSA knows the secret
numbers that break Dual_EC-DRBG [or not, we can't know]"
Read the full essay which contains links to papers if you are interested.
And the NSA work on standards repeatedly.
"The NSA has always been intimately involved in U.S. cryptography
standards -- it is, after all, expert in making and breaking secret codes."
That's also what comes out of the Snowden leaks.
I understand that ECC used for Tor is different from what the essay is
However the NSA may found something it can exploit in ECC and made NIST
(maybe unknowingly) standardize the curve (or whatever) that is most
vulnerable or recommends for a weak one, or for too short keys.
Does Tor use stuff certified or recommended by NIST?
If so would it be reasonable to move to international standards
(whatsoever) without the involvement of NIST and NSA 'consultation'?
(Completely unrelated to what might be going on, just as defense-in-depth.)
The NSA likes playing around. [2][3] (found while searching)
Oh and I'm not trying fear-mongering here or try to conspire whenever or
not the NSA has subverted cryptographic functions (in one way or another).

Do not dare to reply again before your weekend is over. Probably don't
even read it.
That sounds good to me. (Knew that you use 25519, but not if NIST
certified it.
I thought so.
I knew that and did not worry back then.
I remembered that and wondered why the winner is the winner.
That would be the case, then.
Thanks, I'll yet have to read them.
It has been said before that the implementation has to be done
correctly, which is obviously harder if there's more room for failures.
What seems to be quite difficult. I'm not a cryptographer so I can
hardly know.
Is that true for signatures of emails as well?
If so, is this weakness the reason that no-one involved in Tor* got a
DSA key for signing?
For example Erinn got an RSA for signing the bundles.
*those I checked.
(DSA = Deep[fried] Sh*t Algorithm)
No authority is to blame for a poor implementation, just the one(s)
implementing it. One can not proof (without leaked material) that a
certifying or consulting party or even an implementing party had an
malicious intend.
It would be hard to believe that they all collaborating with an
malicious intend. Soooo many people.
(Well I had not believed the scale and depth of the NSA spying, although
I assumed they would spy.)
I could have imagined that.
TLS 1.0 had (well it should still have it) problems.
I remembered BEAST and CRIME and just looked at it again to confirm my
believe that 1.1 (at least somewhat) and 1.2 resolved those problems,
which is not completely true.
Reading the security section of its Wikipedia entry does not give my
much confidence either.
I see RC4 for encryption on websites. (https hooray)
If just everything had perfect forward secrecy (PFS) built-in, some
situations of the NSA spying would not be as bad as they are.
Bureaucracy has to be spelled bureaucrazy as it is crazy at least at times.
At times you may ask what's the lowest possible common ground and it may
has to be the lowest of all you ask.
But who can say if that is actually always true?!
Where are the sun-rays that penetrate the cloud(s)?! (Everything looks
bad, there doesn't appear to be something to look forward to, or is
there something to look forward to?)
(I knew I included the question twice.)
I'll added 'everything' after 'nearly' (correct me if I'm wrong). Yes
they recommend a lot of things (to me it seems they would).
(Everything is linked. I knew it. ;) )
They are all stupid, then. ;) Well not sure what they are. I see that
just replacing US standards (or whatever) with international standards
(or whatever) does not magically help.
You use 25519, so I'm confident that others, when they trust you ("we
know where the money comes from"), use it, too.
So far I have nothing to make me hope for the EU about anything.
Commercial lobbying is something the EU is influenced by.
When it involves politics the department for fishing (yes, actual
fishes) might decide what cipher is used. (I'm over-saturating here, am I?)
For actual cryptographers I have no clue if your hopes are justified.
Well I hope they are.
Could be good.
Could be good, too. Well aren't more people better as more brains know
more things and more eyes see more things or "too many people making too
many problems? (and there's not much love to go around. Tell me why this
is a land of confusion")
I'll write a proposal to improve Tor's random number generator. ;)
(consisting of three dice and Schr?dinger's cat with a few mice)
I on the other hand have to stay focused, (Firefox: cared, but could not
do anything useful, hate the changes being made and the process, don't
care about it, still use and complain about it. The closer I get, beside
just using the stuff the worser it gets) don't get mad, pissed off or
There have been times where I thought to not care about Tor anymore to
not go insane about the issues you have to deal with. Well I'm still
reading most threads on the mailing-list (excluding those dealing with
ARM or exceeding my knowledge), following the timeline and file tickets,
read papers. I have not been on IRC for quite some time to maintain my
distance, though I have no idea if that's sane.
If I can do something to keep you focused (for example not writing too
long emails) let me know. Or the community in general.
Happy weekend to all and everyone (including NSA agents)

The performance graph for 50KiB pieces [2] shows also a decline in

I can't make TracBrowser show me anything in any repository, beside
folders. (not that I really need it).
For example selecting 'Tor' gives me five folders. Even if I select
'master branch' or '0.2.4.17-rc' they are all empty. Screen shot [1].
In Gitweb however (I have no deep relation to it and merely know what I
can do with it) shows me all the files in that repository. Screen shot [2].
If once is supposed to hit 'View changes', I'm confused. It presents a
diff generate (as it seems) and shows two paths and two revision
numbers, where both are the same. I guess one has to change the 'from'
revision to some previous revision, but I don't know any, not even the
current. Screen shot [3].
Gitweb on the other hand shows me the files and would allow me to see
diffs between its versions. I can see the commits and what has been
changed. (Not that this makes me more clueful, but I can do it)
Am I doing something wrong? (Sure I do, but most of the time there is an
outcome anyway) or doesn't the TracBrowser work yet? [yet another

Thank you for operating gabelmoo, thank you for your support, thank you
That appears to be logical. This is also in line with what I believed to
know about how the consensus is formed.
It was indeed the wording of the notice line(s) that made me believe a
consensus of an authority would somehow be bound to that authority.
Attention Damian Johnson ;)
How about "Consensus fetched from ..." or "Consensus downloaded from..."?
(If that requires discussion I happily open a ticket)
I don't see any benefit (at first glance) to change (and most likely
increase complexity) the voting/signing process. Especially since the
consensus is valid and it is expected to be fetchable from any authority.
When it is what it appears to be then I agree.

It has to be ensured that those are not accessed without the users
The remote operator claim would require evidence of some sort.
Considerably attackers want to get into systems worth getting into.

Without being able to evaluate the risk:
It also depends on where and who your adversary is. If all account are
at the same provider, the provider should be able to know after some
repeated e-mail retrievals that always happened at the same time for all
these accounts.
If your adversary could watch all email providers and can tell that
there are always three accounts that have their emails checked at always
the same time then he knows that they are linked.
I'm unaware of how a local (at your end) adversary would be able to tell
that you check multiple account at the same time.

16.07.2014 20:10, Griffin Boyce:
I'm not agreeing with what pinkmeth does. For the case that they do what
the media has told me, it's all about "revenge" porn.
Assuming most of the content was created with the consent of every
person involved, the created porn was consensual porn. Eventually and in
most cases very likely the produced porn was only created for private
entertainment and not expected to be made public by either side.
For cases involving pictures and videos taken against someones consent
or without knowledge I would find it acceptable to call it nonconsensual
It just might mislead people to believe the sexual actions also happened
without consent, but that is just a guess on my side.
Anyway, improving hidden-services for the purpose of hosting revenge
porn, that has actually been published with ill intent is distasteful.
Sure, there is much worser stuff on and off Tor as far as the media report.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Spoofing a browser profile to prevent fingerprinting 
Am 26.07.2014 um 20:14 Craw:
you may want to read the design document of the TorBrowser [1].
I think it has been suggested before.
The idea of the TorBrowser is to make all users look alike.
For the user-agent the design doc [1] has the goal:
"Design Goal: All Tor Browser users MUST provide websites with an
identical user agent and HTTP header set for a given request type. We
omit the Firefox minor revision, and report a popular Windows platform.
If the software is kept up to date, these headers should remain
identical across the population even when updated."
I think "4.6. Cross-Origin Fingerprinting Unlinkability" covers it, for
the most part, if not for everything.
I would think a random user-agent doesn't add anything to it. If I see a
Tor Browser user-agent with a Tor IP address now and 30 minutes later
another (the same) Tor Browser user-agent with a Tor IP address (either
the same or another) it doesn't help me to determine if the request
comes from the same user. On the other hand if I see a random user-agent
with a Tor IP address now and 30 minutes later another random
(different) user-agent with a Tor IP address (either the same or
another) I would guess that this isn't any better than the former case.
With enough requests it might be that statistical differences occur and
one could guess that the random user-agents belong to different users or
that they a just one user.
That appears to be true for two users accessing the same website over
the same exit node at the same time. If they both have different
user-agents, they can be easily told apart.
Does anyone think I missed something?
See "4.6. Cross-Origin Fingerprinting Unlinkability", specifically
"Fingerprinting defenses in the Tor Browser" Point 2.
Tor Browser returns empty canvas data, so it is not possible to be
fingerprinted on them. Tor Browser prompts the user, along with a
message about just having returned empty canvas data, for allowing or
disallowing access to canvas data.
"Fingerprinting defenses in the Tor Browser" Point 4.
"[...] we limit both the number of font queries from CSS, as well as the
total number of fonts that can be used in a document with a Firefox
patch. We create two prefs, browser.display.max_font_attempts and
browser.display.max_font_count for this purpose. Once these limits are
reached, the browser behaves as if browser.display.use_document_fonts
was set. We are still working to determine optimal values for these prefs."
I'm not involved with development, but I'd opt for being able disable
The design document [1] says at "A.1. Deprecation Wishlist"
"The Referer Header
We haven't disabled or restricted the Referer ourselves because of the
non-trivial number of sites that rely on the Referer header to
"authenticate" image requests and deep-link navigation on their sites.
Furthermore, there seems to be no real privacy benefit to taking this
action by itself in a vacuum, because many sites have begun encoding
Referer URL information into GET parameters when they need it to cross
http to https scheme transitions. Google's +1 buttons are the best
example of this activity.
Because of the availability of these other explicit vectors, we believe
the main risk of the Referer header is through inadvertent and/or covert
data leakage. In fact, a great deal of personal data is inadvertently
leaked to third parties through the source URL parameters.
We believe the Referer header should be made explicit. If a site wishes
to transmit its URL to third party content elements during load or
during link-click, it should have to specify this as a property of the
associated HTML tag. With an explicit property, it would then be
possible for the user agent to inform the user if they are about to
click on a link that will transmit Referer information (perhaps through
something as subtle as a different color in the lower toolbar for the
destination URL). This same UI notification can also be used for links
with the "ping" attribute."
Thank you for your thoughts and your input on how to improve the Tor
I hope you get some more feedback. Especially from people working on the
Tor Browser.

Am 27.07.2014 um 04:14 Virgil Griffith:
Youtube gets blocked in some countries, too.
Videos are generally a problem if the website doesn't make use of HTML5
video and the user uses the Tor Browser as recommended. Most often it
will require Flash.
Streaming any video/movie over Tor would be slow, I guess.
* Large images  -- cameras make high resolution pictures these days.
That's true for day to day pictures. Those take longer to load over Tor.
Viewing high resolution photos of naked angles or ankles is probably
another use case, since those might be blocked for normal browsing.
There are (professional) photos of the night sky, the fauna, the flora,
buildings and so on. They tend to have a high resolution.
* Uploading files to someplace -- be it photo sharing sites, social
media websites, video hosting platforms. Either because they are blocked
or because what you upload should not be connected with you and your IP
address. Photos, videos or documents of crimes or other wrong-doings,
come to mind.
There are probably still other use cases that suffer from the speed of Tor.

That has to be a violation of your rights.
Whatever country gives you money in form of an donation should be
perfectly fine. You are not doing business with them, they give you the
money an that's it. (Otherwise it wouldn't be a donation. If I demand
something specific for the money it is no longer a donation, it becomes
sponsorship or a business relationship.)
Money is speech, isn't it? It's just a promise.* If that is true, then
preventing you from taking money is a violation of your first amendment.
Couldn't this country pay coders, working under their guidance? Code is
speech as well. I understand that this is difficult, because money does
nothing. You take money from the US government and that itself won't try
anything stupid, however some payed coders working for some government
(or company) might attempt such thing.
Money is money; independent from the source.
If payed contribution is ruled out for that donor (whoever that is),
because of its country how could the money get to you? Maybe the donor
gives it to some middle-man that is not on the blacklist. The middle-man
then transfers the money to you. (This has to be legal, because that is
done with weapons as well. Countries not allowed to sell weapons to some
country, sell it to their friendly surrounding countries and the weapons
end up where they were wanted in the first place.)
I'm not living in your country, but would it help to write some
congressman? It truly has to be handled in a different way for
non-profit organizations. (Especially for those that physically help
people, e.g. medical help.)

08.03.2014 00:39, Hongyi Zhao:
Interesting. The description can be interpreted as you did and I'm not
sure how to phrase it to avoid confusion.
Atlas and Globe (both using data from Onionoo) present details about the
network. E.g. what relays exist and what flags they have. This includes
their public IP address. You will find bridges, but their listed IP
address is not their real IP address. Bridge IP addresses got sanitized
to avoid adversaries querying and blocking them.
Only the default ways for getting bridges can be used, where you can
request obfs2/3 bridges as well. This tool is not what you are looking for.
I'm curious if this is a mistake that occurs more often, in which case
Atlas and Globe should probably do something to not confuse users.

Done, I did not know that Onionoo does not know the contact lines. I knew that
they are contained in the descriptors.
A mail to the relay list should be a good start for those that operate

Usually I ignore the lines that inform about turtles, because they

Either turtles reports a different IP address each time, and when the
doctor tries to access it it fails because the IP address is not up to
date or the doctor tries different IPs which don't work because the are
not turtles IP address.
According to globe 76.73.17.194 is turtles IP address. DirPort is 9030.
Can anyone explain what is causing this?

I appear to lack imagination on how Tor helps abuse victims. Since some
of you are involved with some organizations working in that field, I
hope you give some insight.
Personally I see no benefit in using Tor from the point of view of an
abuse victim. Beside the properties why anyone could use Tor.
Quite the opposite, the abuser seems to gain more by using Tor, if
he/she (mostly he) is anonymous in the first place.

I hadn't imagined that victims keep in contact with their abusers or
have their communication data exposed to their abusers.
01.10.2014, 19:49 Derric Atzrott:
Unfortunately that appears to be true in some cases, for whatever amount
of 'some'.
I see that this holds a higher risk of being exposed than just visiting
a website dealing with abuse.
Indeed, I think it is.
Up to this point there is nothing I would have not claimed to be Tor not
being useful for, it's just that I'd recommend people to look up or
discuss their medical conditions for the same reasons.
That is something I had not imagined for abuse cases. I'm familiar with
this being useful for dissidents or leaking of documents about war
crimes, environmental issues, corruption and such things.
Thank you both. To avoid overloading tor-talk, I consider myself
satisfied with the replies I got (because I am), if however others want
to add something, because it is good to have success stories of Tor on
tor-talk, then please add what you think.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Merging all languages (locales) into one Tor Browser 
by how much would the file size of the Tor Browser package or
"installer" be increased if it would contain all languages?
Currently every locale got its own package or "installer", why not just
having one?
- Less space required to store Tor Browser packages, overall. (For the
servers of Tor and the mirrors)
- User's don't have to download two or more packages if they speak
multiple languages. (Includes not to have to download another package
for a friend that is more comfortable with its native language.)
- Less "searching" for the right package. ("Where is my language.")
- Maybe less bandwidth used.
- Maybe less time for packing. (Depends on how the process actually
works to get reproducible packages per locale.)
- Less hashing and signing required (although I assume it is done in a
batch process).
Upcoming upsides (by or for stuff that is planned, but not ready):
- Less voting on correct hashes for including them in the consensus.
- Less entries in the consensus, therefore lesser in size, therefore
lower bandwidth usage required.
- Higher file size for the package.
- Higher bandwidth requirement for single package users.
- Users have to select their language during "install". (UI problem?)
- Maybe more bandwidth used from the servers of Tor POV and their mirrors.
I verify the package I use, but no other package. Assuming that
signatures are not checked by every user, having more packages increases
the blind spot, especially for languages with fewer users.
Are there any reasons to distribute the Tor Browser in packages per
locale? With other words. Why is it done how it is done?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Updating TIMB with Tor Browser's update mechanism? 
since TIMB is (unfortunately) not ready, yet, this is something you may
want to try.
The updater doesn't seem to be able to write outside its own directory,
unless there is a directory traversal feature built-in. (That would be a
bug.) This makes it necessary to have all folders of TIMB within the
folder "Browser" (with capitalized B).
I assume TIMB is going to be "installed" via an "installer". It would be
trivial to prompt the user to extract it to where Tor Browser was
extracted to.
Mostly my question is about using the mechanism, Tor Browser does not
have to be around. If the updater for Tor Browser turns out to be what
you are looking for, make it work for TIMB as well. Ship the same
mechanism with TIMB.

14.09.2014, 08:16 John Pinkman:
For data belonging to users who signed up it includes their consent.
Facebook or any other company, tracking people who have not agreed to it
is violating their privacy.
I'm sure you can provide some evidence for that assertion.
The intention of PinkMeth is different and the usecase. Whereas people
share private information among each other with each others consent on
Facebook, somebody betrays someone's trust and uploads it to PinkMeth,
without or against the explicit consent.
To me it is unreasonable to share intimate information over Facebook or
ICQ or unencrypted email, because I am aware of the fact that parties
along the wires can read it.
Nothing seems to prevent my communication parter from betraying me.
I'm sure you have evidence that the user can not disable cloud storage.
It is unreasonable for them to encrypt stuff they would like to work
with. I agree that they are not interested in someone's privacy, if it
collides with their business.
If we talk about sending nudes over snapchat and assume that they will
never be shared, then this assumption will crumble pretty fast. The
statement that this pictures are taken for sending them away is not true
for all cases. Couples may take pictures or videotape themselves and it
ends up on PinkMeth as the relationship falls apart.
If someone believes in Santa Claus or is religious with the believe in
an omnipresent being... nothing.
Attempting to remove them doesn't seem to be reasonable. It just pulls
attraction to those pictures. If PinkMeth wouldn't have been in the
news, almost no one would no about it. So it is better to not talk about
BlackMath, because if no one talks about it no one will be dragged to it.
It is unreasonable to assume that third-parties handle private
information reasonable. I agree that it is stupid to give them more
information as they need to.
Your medical advisor needs to know certain things, you most likely
consider private, and you can not prevent your advisor from leaking
them. Tor can't help you here. There is no technology that can do.

Quote Point 3:
External App Blocking and Drag Event Filtering
External apps can be induced to load files that perform network
activity. Unfortunately, there are cases where such apps can be launched
automatically with little to no user input. In order to prevent this,
Torbutton installs a component to provide the user with a popup whenever
the browser attempts to launch a helper app.
Additionally, modern desktops now pre-emptively fetch any URLs in Drag
and Drop events as soon as the drag is initiated. This download happens
independent of the browser's Tor settings, and can be triggered by
something as simple as holding the mouse button down for slightly too
long while clicking on an image link. We filter drag and drop events
events from Torbutton before the OS downloads the URLs the events contained.
The workaround I see is to create shortcuts manually. Obliviously it has
to be ensured TorBrowser handles those shortcut if that is supposed to
be the case. Maybe other's can find better ways.

02.01.2015, 22:23 Michael Fitzpatrick:
Hi Michael,
what I was suggesting was to craft the shortcut file on the desktop
manually or semi-manually.
I'm lacking the knowledge of how OSes (Linux, Mac, most Windows
versions) handle this.
On Windows 7 you can create a link by right-clicking on the desktop and
select shortcut. It allows to input a URL. Either by typing or by copying.
If OSes inspect drag-and-drop operations I guess they could inspect copy
operations maybe for the purpose of checking if a link is "safe", so
typing would be safer.
Anyway, if I create such a shortcut and double click it afterwards, the
system default browser is opened.
Because of this not seeming to be helpful I was hoping for others to
come up with better ways.

09.01.2015, 13:00 Michal Zuber:
that's not a problem if you think it is.
TBB just connects to some entry relay and this particular one listens on
port 21. You can see it on Globe [1] or Atlas.
Tor relays can accept connections on any port they like.
There are people behind restrictive firewalls that just allow to connect
to certain ports. It might be that port 5500 is blocked, but a user can
connect to port 21. Since relays are public, it's not too useful against
adversaries that actually block connections to the Tor network.

First, I am unaware how this dance takes place. It seems to be the case
that 'Faravahar' has a different understanding of who is a authority and

Second, since there will be a number of authorities that is divisible by
two it seems that there could be situations where ties would occur
during the voting process. IIRC you've always preferred to avoid that,
so either 'urras' gets replaced or another authority gets nocked down.
(E.g. less people that have to be trusted.) What's your plan? Is there a
ticket where this is tracked?
Poor 'urras' seemed to have and seems to have trouble:
This is likely one of the reasons why you are migrating away from it.
I saw
authorities are more than one hour old and therefore not fresh anymore:
an awful lot, so it could be a candidate for an authority to get rid of,
