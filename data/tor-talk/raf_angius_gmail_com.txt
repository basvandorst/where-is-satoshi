I just discovered that the same day a DDoS attack against Saudi Arabia had
place. Can these events be related somehow in your opinion?

Hi, Faffa here.
Trying so hard to understand the problem with those spikes. Since I have
the impression that it's not a human activity, one option I was discussing
with some friends is that it could be a strategy to force connections into
a specific node, by saturating the others. Does it make any sense to you?

That's what I've been thinking 'till now, it took a while to reach you
here. But if it is a botnet activity, who did this? It's in two
different countries, so would sound like a third party....
