I'd like to announce the availability of Tortilla, a free open-source tool
that allows users to securely, anonymously, and transparently route all
TCP/IP and DNS traffic through Tor.
Though the Tor client natively supports transparent proxying on Linux-based
systems, Tortilla allows Tor users to use Windows for transparent proxying.
Unlike other similar solutions, Tortilla does not rely on API hooks (and as
such does not allow malware to circumvent the Tor tunnel) and does not
require extra hardware, a VPN, or an extra Tor gateway virtual machine.
The whitepaper for Tortilla which describes the design goals, architecture,
and usage instructions is available at
The source code is available at A pre-built distribution (compatible with 32-bit and 64-bit versions of
Windows XP through Windows 8) is available at
Tortilla is still in beta, but I'd be pleased to answer any questions you
may have about it.
Please note that Tortilla is produced independently from the Tor(r)
anonymity software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about
quality, suitability or anything else.

Interested in learning more about Tortilla? I recently presented a webcast
in which I covered Tortilla's purpose and architecture, and showed some live
demos of Tortilla in use.
You can check out the video here:
If you have any questions about Tortilla, don't hesitate to email me.
