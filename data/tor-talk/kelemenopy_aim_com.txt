@_subject: [tor-talk] Hotmail with Tor 
In my experience, Hotmail simply stopped working with Tor (and the Tor browser) about a month ago. I can view mailboxes, but can't open messages. Not long afterwards, Hotmail also stopped working with Outlook. Presumably the cause is some change to Hotmail. Any thoughts on a work-around?

my problem is only with junk messages....
i can open mails and send ....
it was not like that before....
I cannot seem to properly use Hotmail and Tor.
I have disabled NoScript and HTTPS-Everywhere but to no avail.
I can login with no problems and see the inbox but when I click on a message then one of two things happens.? Either I get sent back to the "Home" page which shows me the "Hotmail Highlights" or else the page seems to load itself but the message does not get opened.
I have tried with multiple Tor exit nodes.? Same problems.
Has anyone else experienced the same issue?? Is their a solution??

@_subject: [tor-talk] NSA PRISM implications for Tor 
No Such Agency has probably had its hooks in Tor all along and used it to concentrate dissidents and others for convenience.

The report mentions that they have direct access to ISP's servers as
well as service providers such as Microsoft, Google and Yahoo.  Since
most US users end up going to US websites, does this imply that NSA now
has end-to-end correlation available on most US internet users?  I.e. is
Tor's usefulness finished for Americans?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Elementary question 
Since I installed TBB 3.5, I've been unable to use AOL mail. A search of the Tor Project Web site (perhaps too cursory) failed to yield clues that might lead to a solution. Any thoughts on what to do or where to look for more information?
