I'm having a hard time understanding a lot of what you're saying but I
think I understand the goal which is specifically to root out
terrorists in this case to help investigators find terrorists. You can
refer to Roger's link above as to why Tor will never do that.
So, if you decide that an investigation is illegal, are you knowingly
going to withhold the information to grant them access to the server?
In most jurisdictions [especially those that would be most likely be
in this situation], it is illegal to do this and you would be forced
to provide access to the server either way.
Even so, from a larger view, you would not want a tor administrator to
be put in the situation of choosing when he or she should allow an
investigator to access their server.  For example, I decide to grant
police access when they are searching for a pedophile and not when
searching for an oppressed citizen in china but what about a person
that is in the grey like a white hat hacker or PETA activist that are
doing things illegal but not unethical in the eyes of the admin?
As was previously said, the investigators coming in will confiscate
all information and are not interested in having a conversation about
your "Onion router" in the corner.
I just wanted to point out that the guys at Tor are doing a great job
at trying to educate government officials about Tor so that in the
case of a tor server being confiscated they realize that there is not
much they can do. Link below:
I think the idea of zero-knowlege protocol being inserted into Tor is
interesting but your idea adds functionality contrary to where Tor
wants to go but I may be mis-understanding your whole message because
of a language barrier.
There's always the suggestion of forking off into your own version.

@_subject: The "de-Tor-iorate Anonymity" talk by Nathan Evans at DEFCON 16 
I'll comment on that but I know Roger and others were there that might be
able to explain it better.
The idea is that Tor _used to_ allow a user to define an infinite path when
creating circuits so an attacker could generate circular circuits causing
the queue on those circuits to go up, using up processing power, causing
latency etc.  This was done using a what he define as "DoS Client" and "DoS
Server".  So he would attempt to DoS partitions of the Tor network causing
slow downs for all Tor servers involved.
At the same time an attacker would run a malicious Tor exit node that would
inject a  into the traffic which would connect back to a
server which then records how often that ping is received which effectively
measured the latency on that circuit.  So if a client was not using one of
the relays that was affected by the circular circuit, the latency would be
normal.  If the client _did_ use one of the nodes that were being DoS'd, the
latency would suddenly spike thus proving that the entry node was a member
of the DoS'd circuit.
The DoS attack would be done on different circuits until they finally found
one that would slow down the latency of the attacked client which would show
1) the exit node (since it was owned by the attacker), 2) the relay node
that was used,(again because the attacker owned the exit), and 3) the entry
node (because it was affected by the DoS) turning Tor into the single proxy
as it proposed to do.
If anyone is intersted in the presentation - it lacks the technical details
but has a good overview - I don't think I can post it here so email me
Nathan Evans recommended not using fixed path lengths (>3 nodes in a
circuit), don't allow infinite path lengths which is fixed in the newest
version of Tor, induce delays which is not going to happen, and then the
rest we know - disable javascript, use SSL, and monitor exit nodes (see
The presentation was kind of crappy and it's a complicated attack so correct
any of this if I"m wrong.

generated a certificate for mozilla.com from a reseller of the Comodo

It all depends on how you setup your system and what you're using Tor for

Interesting ideas but a few thoughts come to mind that don't look adequately

* payments turn it into a service with an expected outcome.  Assumably
(among others) that is 1) your anonymity is maintained and 2) your payment
is completed successfully.  What happens _when_ something goes wrong? As of
now, the first thing that Tor says is "This is experimental software. Do not
rely on it for strong anonymity. " It would have to add, "Do not rely on
this to successfully route your financial transactions" and while the first
is a warning most can accept, the second may really scare us.
* Mr. Anticapitalism says, "money corrupts!" This could be worked on but I
just imagine server admins taking advantage of the venture.

This is not exactly on topic but because it involves Tor I was hoping
someone else may know some more informationI'll give you my question
first and you can read the details after if it's something you might
be able to help with.
If a person misconfigures their firewall so that their NAT policy
forwards to an internal IP and then makes a firewall rule to allow all
traffic inbound, would it be possible for an attacker to hijack that
connection and use it to connect to a Tor server?
I have a client running pFSense for their firewall and they
misconfigured it so that a NAT policy was created to setup port
forwarding of port 443 to an internal server.  He then made a firewall
rule to allow any protocol from any source to connect to anything
inbound or outbound. Obviously wrong.
He noticed a lot of traffic involving TCP 9001 and reverse look ups
showed connections to Tor exit nodes.  We fixed the firewall issue as
soon as we found it and the Tor connections stopped.
There are two computers on the network and neither are running Tor and
netstat didn't show any attempts to connect out.  (I know this isn't
indepth but it's at least an attempt)  Would it be possible that an
attacker could be hijacking the firewall to make outbound connections
thereby creating a proxy server before he joins a Tor server?

@_subject: 27C3 on Tor 
Not sure if anyone else watched the video but of course there is a
different story than the Wired article.
If you don't want to sit through the whole hour, here's how I would sum it up:
The talk in general was about modern tactics for profiling web users.
They actually had some interesting stuff to say about how easily and
accurately they were able to correlate a user to his or her web
traffic but that's off topic.  My take away from the entire thing is
that there are new technologies to apply machine learning for
automated statistical analysis of traffic.  In other words, the
attacks Nick referenced of 2002 are more feasible.  (They do admit
that this is nothing new) The same rules apply though and that is you
can only be profiled if you are performing the activities that they
have in their database and it seems to me that this is more difficult
than they make it sound.  Profiling a website that has streaming
content would be difficult to nail down into a set profile.  They
conclude by saying that the easiest way to protect yourself is to do
multiple things at the same time which increases the likliness that
they can profile your activity to their database. I seem to remember a
Google Code project that generated random data to obfuscate your
fingerprint.  Anyone remember?
You can see in the video at 31:48 when they start specifically talking
about Tor.  The specifics of their version of the attack look like
1) The attack starts out where the attacker sets up a Tor client
running the same OS version and browser and uses tools to profile a
website like slashdot.org.
2) their "website profiling tool of doom" makes connections to the
website they want to profile.  They say that after 2000 requests over
a 2 week period, they are able to accurately profile a website no
matter what specific content is on the page.  This is metadata
profiling like packet size, direction, etc.
3) After they have a database of sites, they intercept a Tor client's
traffic locally and correlate it with their data.
They make a comment that Andriy Panchenko is one of the people that
increased the accuracy of this attack by a lot but they don't give the
details of what he added. His website is here but I didn't find any
details:   Prior to his involvement, the
attack was at a 3% accuracy.
They really don't have any suggestions for the Tor network.  They did
say that padding, as I originally thought would help, doesn't affect
this attack so that wouldn't prevent the attack.  Roger, it sounds
like you had some specific ideas as to where to put the padding
compared to a global value so maybe that's different than what they
were talking about.  They do comment that TCP fragmentation over the
Tor network causes size variation of packets over which makes things
easier.  Not sure how much value there is in working on that aspect.

Hey, it's been a while so I'm sorry if this has already been
discussed. Hadn't seen it in the archives
I wanted to bring up the subject of Convergence.io as it fits in with
Tor. Details here: The short version of it is that it's a replacement to the current CA
system. Instead of relying on a single entity for validation, it
applies a web-of-trust style validation process. For example, you
would install a bunch of trusted notaries into your browser so that
when you visit an SSL enabled site, the certificate is validated
between all of them so that you hopefully come to a consensus (or at
least a majority) about the authenticity of that cert. There's a lot
more to it but you can read about it yourself.
My thought is that if implemented correctly (which it's currently
not), this could get more people to enable SSL on their sites with
their own self signed certificate thereby making Tor browsing more
secure. Secondly, hosting notaries as hidden services may be a good
way to implement this on the Tor network.
Also it seems like Moxie is attempting to implement some of the same
infrastructure paradigms that Tor has already so I wonder if anything
can be applied that Tor already has learned.

It's just really bugging me and I couldn't figure it out. :) Thanks.
I'm speaking in reference to section 5.1 of the control spec.

Thanks for pointing that out. Am I reading that correctly that the
hashedcontrolpassword value in the config file can also be in base64?

Can anyone tell me what mechanisms we (or the Tor Project members)
have in scanning for malicious exit nodes. Such as nodes that are
manipulating DNS requests, stripping SSL, etc. I know of the SOAT
project from Mike Perry but the last I heard there was a GSOC dev
working on the project. Is that still being used?

Actually, I might be a good fit. Feel free to ping me off-list to discuss.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Bad Exit Node Control 
I'm working on an updated version of SnakesOnATor (SOAT) that was used
to monitor the Tor network for bad exit nodes. This is a similar
function to InspectTor hosted on a .onion site but that page owner has
not been reachable and has not reached out to other Tor folk.
The main problem with InspecTor is that he/she is recommending that
because a bad exit node has been detected, users should change their
Tor configs to never use those nodes. This would eventually negatively
affect a user's anonymity as they would create a network fingerprint
unlike any others.
But this is, AFAIK, going to be the same problem that SOAT or any
future solution would have. Namely, that there is no official
mechanism to kick off a bad exit. If I understand correctly, this was
a manual process in the past that entailed emailing the op and
eventually kicking them off?
I'm looking for feedback on the above statements. Maybe I'm missing
something or do not know about the underlyings of the process.
If I do understand it correctly, I wonder if a solution is necessary
that integrates monitoring and removing bad exit nodes and malicious
activity, If we agree that users should not change their routes, then
routes should be changed on a global level to remove bad exits by an
authoritative party. Such a solution would be a challenge to say the
least because what stops a bad Op from spinning up a new node. Maybe
this is the reason we haven't done this in the past.

Yeah the plan is to do a complete rerwrite of SoaT. That guy was a
beast and almost did its job too well. I talked a little about this on
the tor-dev side but I'm definitely using Stem. I didn't know about
the other project though so thank you. There was also some discussion
about interfacing with Onionoo but now we're talking too far down the
Exactly. I think Mike Perry's proposal that Aaron linked to is still
spot on in terms of what we want from a solution. In the deployment
section it notes three phases where the final one is an automatic
communication between the scanning engine and the Tor Network so that
it alerts Directory Authorities. This interface in itself requires
some thought. It's threat model includes accidentally causing a DoS on
all hosts on the network if something goes wrong, or inappropriately
flag a good node, or the fact that knowing how to tool works, a
malicious node could change it's activities to avoid detection.
The other issue that is stuck in my head is that I think exit scanning
is always going to be a losing battle and this is a best-effort game.
I see it in the same way that Android has tried to keep track of
malware on the Play market. It will be days in even the best case
scenario before we find out an exit node is malicious and properly
report them. It's high effort for little return.
In an ideal - not-Tor world - there could be some kind of activation
process for exit nodes that validate configurations and performs
simple checks before they join the network, and contact information is
confirmed (or at least attempted). This assuredly will never happen
for a variety of reasons one of which is that it's a deterrent for
those volunteer operators that we need lots and lots of. I wonder if
this has already been discussed or if it's worth at least documenting
the design decision somewhere. It's valid to say "We won't do this
because of X Y and Z" but I would like to see how the debate would go
against a realistic solution (that has yet to be proposed).

I took another look at the OONI project. Although it's oriented towards
ISPs etc, isn't this almost exactly what's needed - or at least a start?
The tests for many of the items that Mike Perry identified in the spec are
already there.

I wanted to make some of us aware that Recorded Future is a threat intel
service that is doing a webinar in how to run exit nodes that sniff
traffic. In the webinar they will show how to "Visualize malicious cyber
activity from Tor exit nodes."
