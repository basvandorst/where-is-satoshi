@_subject: [tor-talk] Thunderbird, GMail and Tor - is it safe? 
My question is about the safety of using Thunderbird to send e-mail
through Tor.
A little background: I run a moderate capacity (~500-600 kb/s) Tor
relay. I've configured my Thunderbird client to use the Tor network, as
well as to not leak DNS resolves, and I've verified through test e-mails
that they are being sent to the GMail server through a Tor exit node. My
accounts are configured to use SSL/TLS for both IMAP and SMTP.
I understand that once e-mail leaves the GMail servers, it's about as
secure as sending an open post card.
My question is whether the SSL/TLS connections between my e-mail client
and the GMail server are being made through the Tor network, and whether
using Tor in such a way exposes my otherwise unencrypted e-mail to a
greater risk of being skimmed by, say, a potentially hostile Tor exit node?
My goal is simply to anonymise my IP, which gets leaked gratuitously by
Thunderbird, and to ensure that the e-mail gets to the GMail server as
securely as if I was using the https web mail.
Thanks in advance for any assistance!

Thanks a lot for the info!
I do use Enigmail quite often, but the problem is the usual, a
relatively small proportion of my contacts (read friends and family)
care about privacy and encryption... what can I say, it's a work in
It's reassuring to know that the SSL is working through TOR. Then the
only thing I have to worry about is how sensitive the message is for the
rest of the Internet!
   I remembered that I forgot to paste the headers after I
sent the original e-mail, but I got a similar output. I assumed that
"(version=SSLv3 cipher=AES128-SHA)" meant that that was the encryption
used between my computer and the GMail server.
Truth be told, GMail has become a lot more bitchy recently with newly
created accounts, especially through Tor, demanding everything from
Captchas to mobile phone confirmation... so the last few burner accounts
I've created through Tor were on Yahoo. All of the Gmail addresses I use
were created years back, and they still bug me occasionally when I use
the webmail (after accessing it through VPNs and Tor). But I haven't had
any problems at all accessing both GMail and Yahoo through IMAP,
regardless of the location, VPN or Tor...
Might sound redundant, but all of my GMail accounts run on
imap.googlemail.com:993 and smtp.gmail.com:465; Yahoo runs perfectly
through imap.mail.yahoo.com:993 and smtp.mail.yahoo.com:465. I used the
configuration instructions for Thunderbird from here

@_subject: [tor-talk] Any problem installing TBB & Vidalia bundle on same 
I'm still sticking to Torbutton - I prefer the flexibility of being able
to switch it on and off when I need, rather than launching a new
browser. That being said, I frequently run Tor with Firefox at the same
time as my e-mail client (all of which is routed through Tor). As long
as Vidalia's opened, you should be able to use multiple programs with
Tor simultaneously.
With Thunderbird, you can check by sending a test e-mail, even to
yourself, then looking at the source. It's working if you get something
that looks like this:
Received: from [0.0.0.0] (tor-exit-router45-readme.formlessnetworking.net [199.48.147.45])
        by mx.google.com with ESMTPS id v16sm1593516ibf.42.2011.08.11.09.06.31
        (version=SSLv3 cipher=AES128-SHA);
Not sure about other apps like Pidgin etc.

Hash: SHA256
Would this apply if you are running a Tor relay? i.e. impossible to
correlate the time of the incoming packet??
Perhaps the solution is to make it as easy as possible for anyone to
be a low bandwidth tor relay (with speeds of say 32-64 kb/s), which
would increase the size of the network and also the person's
anonymity? I'm thinking as close to possible as 2 clicks and voila...
as it is, it's still a relatively complicated endeavour!

Hi Rhona,
I've been thinking about a similar possibility, but lack the technical
know-how to run a server at a distance. Any idea how to go about it
(i.e. finding servers with providers that are not opposed to Tor, or
DDoS attacks (if it's an exit node)?
Also, there's the issue of bandwidth - running a Tor node on my
connection at ~500kb/s easily goes through 10-20 gb/day for both
uploads and downloads, so the monthly costs can built up quite quickly...
Would love to hear your thoughts!

Sounds about right Curious Kid! The quickest way I use to check
whether everything is OK with tor is to go to If Tor is working, the Google map will be centred on some city that is
not in your country, and the IP will probably mention tor (i.e. the
tor exit node).
Also, if it seems painfully slow, it's a good sign that Tor's working! :)

@_subject: [tor-talk]  Tor on two computers, one IP? 
I'm trying to set up tor on two separate computers using one net
I have a spare computer, which I want to set up as a relay, permanently
using about 1/3 of my bandwidth. On my main computer, I'd like to run a
bridge, or at least as a node (for the enhanced anonymity). I've got it
running on both at the moment, but it seems that only one ever works at
a time.
The other reason I don't just run the relay off my main computer is that
I sometimes need to run a VPN, or reboot my computer, or whatever...tor
prefers stability :)
I don't particularly want to go through the hassle of networking them,
or using the spare as a central tor server, if it can be avoided... btw,
both run Ubuntu and Vidalia.
Any suggestions?
Thanks in advance!

Ah, I think you may have hit the nail on the head with the last
sentence... would it not matter to the tor network that there is one IP
address, but six different sets of ports being forwarded?
(I'm assuming I have to give alternatives to 9001, 9030 and 9050 on the
second laptop)?
I'm also assuming that I have to open the firewall (gufw) on the second
computer to allow these new ports, as well as on the router?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor banned in Pakistan. 
Hi Orionjur,
Sorry to burst your bubble, but Russia is one of the last places I can
imagine banning VPN's and Tor, especially from what I gather from my
contacts in Russia... the FSB already has direct access to all Internet
connection hubs (i.e. in an apartment building), completely by-passing
ISPs and legal requirements!
Have you seen the Russian net? The amount of piracy (as well as Tor
traffic!) that goes through there is staggering! Regardless of all of
the capabilities, authorities are simply not interested in you unless
you *really* step on some toes (and, hint hint, running a Tor relay or
exit node hasn't drawn their wrath so far)... And if you do happen to be
such a person, it is much easier to break your door down using existing
laws (using the crackdown on pirate copies of Windows as an excuse, for
example) than amending the laws to include VPNs!
But you're definitely right about the danger of the capability to block
VPN's - I thought it was restricted to China and other such extreme
regimes. If they can break your door down *just* because they're seeing
encrypted traffic, there's definitely a problem!
Which, of course, doesn't eliminate false positives, like running
Facebook with the https always option turned on, or gmail, or any other
SSL-encrypted site...

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor banned in Pakistan. 
I've heard about these laws, and agree that they're quite idiotic, but
they're no different to a lot of other countries (try getting a drink
somewhere in London after 11-12 PM, even on a Friday/Saturday night -
clubs only)!
If you have any links for this, even in Russian, I'd be very curious! A
lot of governments are not happy with Skype, because it does use very
strong point-to-point encryption (i.e. you can intercept the traffic
between two people, but not decode it unless you have access to the
company's backdoor). Even worse with BlackBerry.
Not sure if they're trying to ban Tor, but I think they'd have a tough
time banning VPNs and encryption (like in Pakistan) - a lot of Russia's
Internet service providers work on Ethernet connections to the home, and
the log-in is done via VPN...
Yep, the SORM -  It's similar to ECHELON, but on a more local level - ECHELON is truly
global, and will no doubt scan this e-mail before it gets to the mail
list ;)
I think SORM can sniff the traffic going through a connection, but I
don't think it can decode Tor traffic - it would need access to your
computer, the private keys etc. I'm no expert on Tor encryption, but I
don't think they could get to it that easily, even if they can send a
virus to your computer (someone, help? :)) They would see an encrypted
stream flowing through, that's all.
It would be even better if you run as a node on the Tor network, even if
you use a small part of your connection - that way it's much much more
difficult to correlate traffic!

I agree only to a certain extent. Paypal and Western Union are easily
traceable. If it was that easy to track down Tor and BitCoin users, Silk
Road would have fallen as well.
However, even with BitCoin, it may be possible to pin down transactions,
or at least narrow the list down considerably. Once you get a foothold,
it can be relatively straight forward to trace the origins (or
destination) of the BitCoins to an exchange...
Interesting and scary read in any case!

/Undercover law enforcement agents infiltrated the group in a sting
    dubbed ?Operation Adam Bomb.? According to the indictment, between
    April and August 2011 one of the defendants received more than
    $261,000 in PayPal transfers for the purchase of drugs, including
    $2,160 that an undercover agent with the Drug Enforcement
    Administration sent him to buy about 30 grams of LSD./
Seriously, how do you expect to remove $261,000 or even $2,000 from
PayPal without it somehow being traced back to you?!
    /...the document /[indictment] /is filled with evidence gathered
    from e-mail communications that took place between 2007 and 2009,
    while the defendants were using Hushmail./
So the lesson of the day is that they used easily-trackable e-mail and
financial transactions to nail the network. It seems like TOR and
BitCoin are safe for now...

@_subject: [tor-talk] Retroactive traffic confirmation attacks on Tor 
Just a quick question, might be stupid: if you were to run all of your
traffic through a VPN, including tor, would the same considerations apply?
Or would they only apply to your VPN provider (provided that they keep
records at all)...?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor to VPN to Internet = Bad. Why? 
It's possible to sign up for VPNs anonymously, as well as finding VPN
providers that keep no logs. Mullvad is a good example of one which you
can sign up for using bitcoin or even cash in the mail. Here's a list of
some more privacay-aware VPNs:
Otherwise, I think it would be a better idea to run your whole
connection through a VPN first, then connect to Tor. That way your ISP
has absolutely no idea what's going on on your connection, plus you have
the additional benefit of obscuring your location.
With a good anonymous VPN + Tor, performance wouldn't be degraded much
at all, and you get double the privacy and security ;)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Where's Torbutton? 
It's been (perhaps unfortunately) superseded by the Tor Browser Bundle,
which includes a version of Torbutton built into a custom Firefox
browser... all due to security issues.
I find it kind of annoying as well, especially since I run a separate
instance of Vidalia for all of my applications... :S

No installation necessary. You download it from here:
And then click on the start-tor-browser script. It should do the rest!
You can run the Bundle at the same time as running a relay...
unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way around this (or at least
one that I've managed to get to work on mine). It opens a new instance
of Vidalia and a new browser window.

I'd love to be able to start the Tor Browser without Vidalia, since I

I use the VPN from riseup.net, it's free with their e-mail service but
you need to 'apply' for an account and wait a few days... The best
commercial VPN service I've found is on  it's based in
Sweden with no IP logging, unlimited bandwidth and you can even pay
anonymously with BitCoin. They have a simple installer for every
operating system, including Linux. Free to try for three hours, 5
euros/$7 per month thereafter, and worth every cent! ;)

It's the other way round, as you said, me -> vpn -> tor. That way my tor
node runs through a VPN (slightly degraded performance), and all of my
regular non-tor traffic also runs through the VPN.
And with a plugin like HTTPS Everywhere, most of the sites I visit are
encrypted all the way. Therefore double encryption.
I live in a country with unfiltered and very fast Internet access, but
where the authorities have a very easy way to tap into your connection
directly if they choose to, without all those annoying judicial
niceties... I just choose to make their job slightly more difficult ;))

@_subject: [tor-talk] A "paranoid" question 
It wouldn't really matter even if they are, would it? I mean, the whole
idea of Tor is that the communication gets encrypted at every hop, so
even if an intermediate computer is CIA, it would (theoretically) not be
able to crack the encryption from the previous hops, as well as not
knowing who is requesting the content (or even what the content is)...
