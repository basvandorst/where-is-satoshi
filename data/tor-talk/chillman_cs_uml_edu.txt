Andre, what you are doing reading my Tor log file?  Explain yourself, sir!
Just kidding.  I think I know the answer to your question (someone please correct me if I am wrong):
Did you modify the default Tor configuration to exclude some nodes?  If you excluded a node which advertises itself as a directory server, then you will see that message whenever your Tor client tries to connect to the excluded node.  The big number is the fingerprint (safer than logging the fully qualified domain name).
If you temporarily comment out the ExcludeNodes line and restart Tor, and then don't see these lines, this would be consistent with my guess.

Luis, did you upgrade tor just before you noticed this problem?  Do you use privoxy or vidalia?
Immediately after an upgrade to tor some time ago, I began experiencing a similar problem.  I noticed that I seem to no longer have the option to choose socks 4a but must use socks5 which last I knew is not really compatible with privoxy, which might explain my problem.
I'd like to troubleshoot this by encrypted email if anyone is willing.
