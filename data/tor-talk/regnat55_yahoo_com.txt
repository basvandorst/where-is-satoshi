@_subject: [tor-talk] gmail no longer usable with tor? 
hi, i use the vidalia + firefox bundle on Windows 7 to access gmail
about 2 weeks ago logging into gmail became impossible
the error message says "cookie mismatch"
i get this no matter which computer i use (with the same set up) or which internet service
any idea what's wrong?
many thanks
