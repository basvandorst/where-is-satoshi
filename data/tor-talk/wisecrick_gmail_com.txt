@_subject: [tor-talk] Run pyobfsproxy standalone 
I want to run pyobfsproxy standalone on my server to obfuscate ssh
traffic. It works without --ext-cookie-file, but it'll also be visible
to the supervisor.
So I want --ext-cookie-file to be enabled, it works on the server
side, but how to config it on the client side?
In my opinion, ext-cookie-file is a 64 bytes random data, am I right?
