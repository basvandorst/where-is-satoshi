@_subject: [tor-talk] Keep ip in tor 
Dear Miss/Sir,
I am a new user of Torproject, so I don't have many experience with it..
But I have a question. My tor browser gives every 3-5 minutes a new IP adress. And I'm playing a online game on the internet wich is based on text. So if my account is logging off every 3 a 5 minutes. I don't want that tor changes it by himself every couple of minutes, but that I can choose when I want for a new identity.
I would like to keep a ip-adress for a few hours or till I choose for a new ip. So my account don't log off.
Could you help me with setting it ?
Hope for a fast reaction and thanking u,
Your sincerely,

Hi, thanks for the help!
I've got a one last question, and that's; does the TrackHostExistExpire a limit for the max. seconds, or can I put just 9999999 behind it ?
Thanking you!

I've downloaded the profile manager, selected the TBB firefox.exe, he opened the TBB, but! But, he said The proxy server is refusing connections.. And it's like firefox, without the button to choose new identity.
So this is not working, I wan't different profiles, so I can open different TBB's with each a own IP-adress..

No, I don't want to run 1 instance of TBB. I wan't to run a few instances of TBB, but all with an other IP-adress. Like you can make profiles in firefox. So you can log in with different accounts at a site. But all the accounts must own an own IP.
