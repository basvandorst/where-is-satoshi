well I'm sorry to say the upstream admin started receiving quite a few complaints regarding the node.  I have had to shutdown the zorton node indefinitely.  Perhaps i'll be able to bring another one up on another server, but until then the Zorton node is dead.
Sorry about that, kinda fun while it lasted.

@_subject: New Tor server 
Hash: SHA1
As of this morning tor ran with a average resident memory usage of about 80 megs and then shutdown at 16:00 UTC when it reached 5 gigs of usage.  At hibernate is was using about 45 megs resident, very usable I think.  I'm going to crank it up a bit more to 10 gigs and see how goes tomorrow.  I think the hosting company this server is on allows 1Terabtye of transfers a month.  However I need to check with the other users and see how much is getting used typically before going too high.
Also I'm thinking of setting the Bandwidthrate to something a little lower (currently not set), any suggestions?
