you probably can access port 8443 fine as there are at least a few
servers allowing exit traffic from there.  my guess is that privoxy may
be causing a problem with javascript in addition to the fact that your
ip keeps changing when using tor (so plesk will keep logging you out
every time your ip changes). -- you can get privoxy to trust your plesk
site's ip/hostname, but you will still have plesk problems when using
tor because of your apparent ip changing.
(i also found bugs when using firefox "deer park" with plesk, so if you
are using that [for the no-dns leakage abilities] then that will be an
issue when trying to do some things in plesk.)

sorry, privoxy probably has nothing to do with it, actually, as it can't
see any of the source with https sites, afaik, because it sits between
the browser and the destination.
but i meant what i said about the ip-changing issue (i had a problem
with plesk, before, too)

for the IP changing/logout issue, you could set your tor client config
to use a specific exit node.

here is the man info:
ExitNodes nickname,nickname,...
      A list of preferred nodes to use for the last hop in the circuit,
if possible.
StrictExitNodes 0|1
      If 1, Tor will never use any nodes besides those listed in
"exitnodes" for the last hop of a circuit.
So you would probably want this in your config:
ExitNodes aSingleTorNodeNameHere
StrictExitNodes 1
to find out which exit notes will exit traffic on 8443 (so you can find
one to use for your exit node, probably changing this to a different one
before any session in plesk you want to start, and for better tor
security the rest of your web surfing time removing this exit node
strictness when you don't need to be using plesk), try any directory
listing like:
and look until you find one whose exit traffic settings allow 8443 to go
out from them. (there may be a better way to find one that meets this
criteria, but i don't know it).
let me know if you get stuck on that.

@_subject: onion wiki(pedia) humor: defacement kills WikiConstitution 
sorry in advance for interjecting humor.  here is an example of a wiki
that died from its own democratic ideals:
From this week's Onion:
Congress Abandons WikiConstitution
September 28, 2005 | Issue 41?39 WASHINGTON, DC?Congress scrapped the open-source, open-edit, online
version of the Constitution Monday, only two months after it went live.
"The idea seemed to dovetail perfectly with our tradition of democratic
participation," Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said. "But when so-
called 'contributors' began loading it down with profanity, pornography,
ASCII art, and mandatory-assault-rifle-ownership amendments, we thought
it might be best to cancel the project." Congress intends to restore the
Constitution to its pre-Wiki format as soon as an unadulterated copy of
the document can be found.
(peter p.: feel free to reply with an impolite statement of mailing list
protocol.  just teasing! =)
