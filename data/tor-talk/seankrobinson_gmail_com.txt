@_subject: [tor-talk] Python TorCtl development 
I am working on a client using the Python TorCtl package.  In the
process, I have begun making (what I consider) improvements to the
TorCtl package.  If I want to discuss development of just the Python
package and not the TOR daemon or network, which is the preferred
mailing list?  Is tor-talk appropriate?  Or would tor-dev be better?
