Thats a Postfix question.
You need to set it up to only accept authenticated connections (at least from outside your LAN).
It could. For example you could give a group of dissidents in another country access to your mail relayer.
But they would have to trust you to not spy on them and you would have to trust them not to send spam mail.
Full anonymity is harder because of spam.

In the Danish IT-Political Association have worked on a CD to promote our rights to privacy, anonymity, fair use, etc. It comes with TOR, Twinkle (with ZRTP), GnuPG, macchanger, libdcss, vlc, etc.
We call it Polippix or the Political CD.
This week we released a version in cooperation with PROSA-bladet
 (the front page is a member of parliament holding the Polippix CD in front of parliament)
published by the PROSA, Association of Computer Professionals. Each of the 12000 subscribers got a CD with TOR, twinkle and a lot of other nice stuff.

I agree.
And I object to assuming that someone running an old version is necessarily uninformed.
There can be circumstances where a user have to choose between and old TOR client or no
anonymity at all, or even no internet.
E.g. We do try to make up-to-date versions of the Polippix CD. But someone may be stuck in
a hotel room somewhere, wanting to be anonymous and remembering putting a Polippix CD in
the suitcase years ago, or an USB-stick with TBB. Yes, it is possible to upgrade TOR
through TOR given a lot of time and RAM, but then again we do not know if there is enough
time and RAM.
I run an TOR-access-point. Users have no way of upgrading TOR on it. They probably do not
even know that they are using TOR. If I fail to upgrade the access-point at we lock it
out, the users loose the internet connection. And the users are not that anonymous anyway.
The wireless traffic is not through TOR.
Why should a client even provide its version? (of the code, not versions of protocols it
If someone ship 100000 CD's/USB-keys to eg Iran they will all have the same version, which
in a year could be almost unique. You can already trach IP-numbers to e.g. Iran, but why
make it easy to detect when e.g. a new shipment arrives or how people move around.

@_subject: How to set time. 
How do you set the system time anonymiously?
I am interested because we make the Polippix live CD. But there could be other circumstances, in which you just do not know the time.
When booting from a live-cd, the time is often wrong, because the hardware clock is off or because the timezone for the hardware clock is unknown (ufortunately not everyone use UTC).
TOR does not work until the time is set correctly. (after TOR is running NTP will not work as it uses UDP, but it would be possible to use some TCP service)
I would prefer to not start each session with making a cleartext time sync, as it opens for denial of service attacks and makes it easier to spot TOR-users.
How about getting the time from TOR nodes, maybe just to figure out the timezone (i,e., change the clock a multiple number of hours)?

@_date: 2009-07-23 12:03:48
@_author: Niels Elgaard Larsen 
@_subject: How to set time. 
Yes, the timing could be tricky. A cron job that check the tor log file (if configuration logs it) for time offset and set the system time could work because TOR should work even if the clock is set some time after it starts. But it is not a very elegant solution.
On the other hand it would work better for eg. TOR browser bundle.

@_date: 2009-07-23 17:32:27
@_author: Niels Elgaard Larsen 
@_subject: How to set time. 
Yes, that was why i suggested only using it to set the time zone by changing the clock a number of hours.
Using an average of three entry-nodes could also work. Maybe add a little random time.
Because what is the alternatives for setting time?
GPS or DCF77 would be good, but requires hardware.
Having users setting it from other sources would work, but not is very user friendly. Especially on a live-cd where we do not even know the local timezone, we would have to let the user also input the timezone or   ask what time it is in London now.
NTP is an option, but if used without authentification it also opens up for the attack you described. For an organization or a country controlling an entire network it would be easy to change timestamps in flight. NTP is even worse because you could change the clock many times during a session. And which NTP-servers with authentification would you use?

@_date: 2009-07-23 18:58:49
@_author: Niels Elgaard Larsen 
@_subject: How to set time. 
No, but what i meant was that if the system time is wrong, there is a good chance that it is a time-zone mismatch in which case adjusting a clock a multiple number of ours should be safe.
Well, if done right it could be a good way for the client to set it time.
But GPS might be an option on e.g. Android platforms in the future.
No, but maybe a hidden node

Yes, but this gives us a better chance to do it right: end-to-end encrytion.
we use twinkle on the Polippix live-CD.
Of course you will not be really anonymous because the recipient will recognize your voice (you can try to disguise it).
Using Twinkle with zrtp on a laptop with macchanger on a public wifi network seems to be the best alternative to TOR. Maybe TOR voip will be possible when TOR get UDP support.
Calling POTS is anonymously is difficult because of payment. But as prices go down it makes it possible that we all share one account financed by donations.

Not if their alternative is to use the same open wireless AP without TOR.
The main reason is to protect the AP owner, not just the AP users.
The AP owner can wish not to run a non-TOR open AP for the same reasons as not to run a
TOR exit-node, e.g., because many users would suffer if the internet connection was
terminated even temporarily.
Yes, but no longer by the ISP of the AP owner or government (unless they bug the AP).
If someone uses an open access-points run by someone he does not know and put personal
info and identity in cleartext, the info will not be personal for long anyway and using a
TOR AP is probably better than e.g., an AP in cafe or school.
I have absolutely no problem sending my name in cleartext through TOR,  when I do not need
to be anonymous. Of course I could already be on Danish Government watch list :-)

When there is a new development in e.g., Iran and new free-speech blogs appearing every

Google, ISP's are not responsible for the actions of their users.
But they _are_ responsible for implementing all kinds of restrictions, policies,
practices, etc.
Google removes content according to the DCMA and filter searches. ISP's implement data
retention, internet filters, etc.
This is a trend that is about controlling the infrastructure of the internet.
They want to control our servers, accesspoints, etc in just the same way as they control
ISP's. Ie. we can run servers and open accesspoints as long as we log everything, require
authentification, etc.
It is not really about making common users responsible for the actions of others. It is
about preventing anonymity.
The lack of anonymity will then deter users from committing crimes, and make it possible
to punish the guilty.

I come from a meeting in the Danish ministry of Justice this afternoon,
They plan to reintroduce the data retention of Internet sessions.
It was scrapped in 2014 after the European Data Retention Directive was
declared invalid by the Court of Justice of the European Union.
But now Denmark plans to require data retention much more invasive than
both the old directive and the pre 2014 danish implementation of.
The most technical interestion points are:
* Logging of session (e.g. a TCP connection), IP addresses and ports in
boths ends.
* Timestamps
* NAT mapping
* Session volume (number of bytes)
* Geo position of mobile data sessions
The volume logging is a new idea.
So for TOR:
1. Tor would kill this right at the entry-node? Even a user fired up
TorBrowser, typed in  watched the video and
closed the brower, there would be enough negoitiation to obfuscate the
2. If a Tor user in Denmark, even using all non-Danish Tor nodes post
something using HTTP POST to a public blog, even one outside Denmark:
could the TOR user be identified given that probably what he posted is
public as well as the timestamp and that the size of POST can be
trivially calculated?

Not so likely. This is a proposed law that the ISP's are fighting. They

my ISP but the ISP behind the site I am connected to. And one or two
