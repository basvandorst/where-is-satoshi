@_subject: [tor-talk] Browser want UNIX sys_admin capability 
Dear Friends,
it happen to see Firefox and tor bundle browser (linux64) both demand for sys_admin capabilities, see man 7 capabilitites.
Why exactly they need the sys_admin caps?
What happens if denied the requested capabilities for example with SE_Linux you can deny. Would that deny harm tor browser? Does run withouth sys_admin?
Thank you very much
Mr. Dobalina

That is very interesting.
could that mean, the Linux distributor is adding this requirement!?
