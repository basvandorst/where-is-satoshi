Fwiw vista has bitlocker, which encrypts partitions or the whole hard disk.
Unfortunately it requires a trusted-platform-module to work, in its default
configuration. It is however possible to also use bitlocker with just a usb
drive (to store the key) by simply changing a group policy rule.
I would like to add utimaco safeguard easy to that list.
