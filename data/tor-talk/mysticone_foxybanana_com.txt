You might want to also add 5222 and 5223 for Jabber and 1863 for MSN if
you're trying to allow your node to be an exit for IM clients.

They won't necessarily use your node to launch DoS attacks.  They'll
annoy the heck out of people on IRC, abuse channels and users, etc., and
then in frustration the people they've annoyed will then launch a DoS
attack against you.  Either that, or they complain to your ISP and you
run the risk of being shut down.
