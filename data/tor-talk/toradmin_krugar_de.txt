@_subject: [tor-talk] Unsafe for Tor? 
unless you are somewhere where you can connect to tor, but not to your
vpn provider, why would you tunnel your VPN through tor? hiding the fact
you are using a vpn? traffic shape obfuscation? i'm curious.
you always end up with the same unencrypted/ssl/tls stream from your vpn
endpoint to the destination.
you -> vpn -> tor = makes sense to me
you -> tor -> vpn = not so much

@_subject: [tor-talk] Help users in Iran reach the internet 
thanks for asking and answering this, i was wondering about it as well.
going to keep stillhavenoipinfo running as is then.
two more questions:
- is it possible to run obfusproxy on an EC2 instance? (never played
with EC2, but given the ready made bridge img...)
- if i run an obfus-bridge node at home (ADSL, NAT'd), can
tor-assistants deal with a dyndns name (IP is changed every 24h by our
beloved Deutsche Telekom)?
useful info

@_subject: [tor-talk] Adblock Plus and Ghostery should be included in Tor 
i tend to agree, but i guess theres several things to keep in mind:
- Usability. Ghostery is _very_ user friendly, but still it can break
widget based sites, e.g. iGoogle.
- Endorsement. If a Plugin is included into the TBB, that may be
considered as "the Tor guys think this is very safe!"
i run NoScript, RequestPolicy, Convergence.io and Ghostery together, and
that breaks like 90% of sites to some degree. i know what is going on
and i want it like this. someone who gets the same browsing experience
from TBB fresh out of the box might just assume the browser to be broken
and abandon it. thats not what we want.
just imagine you switch out the default browser of
$elderly_person_you_know... if they notice anything besides "the
internet is slower lately", they might freak out. thats the kind of user
that wont install AdBlock and Ghostery themselves and may benefit from a
default installation. it has to work smoothly for all their use cases.
i'm not sure how to adress the second concern i raised above, but if
thats a non-issue, maybe a little text on the TBB default homepage
educating users about those plugins might do the trick as well?
all the best

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hiding stuff 
the way the TBB creates anonymity may not be very intuitive, but it does
work. at least as long as you do not identify yourself to a website that
will link your voluntarily given identity to the series of throw-away
cookies TBB leaves with trackers (ohai facebook, i guess).
popular securtiy/privacy addons like RequestPolicy or Ghostery may
simply suppress loading of scripts (and cookies) from 3rd party websites
(which may speed up pageload). if those are not owned by a real 3rd
party, but e.g. used to serve static content, the request footprint of
your pageview is noticeably different, which cannot be hidden and
reduces your anonymity set.
also, those plugins uh... change the web experience and may even render
some pages unusable for less tech-savvy users, which i guess is one
reason they don't come bundled with TBB.
all that being said, if you want to work on this, you could look at
 and for code that lists installed firefox addons.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is Tor still valid? 
this may be a bit of a tangent to your firefox/TBB exploit question, but
it is an answer regarding the validity of TOR:
TOR is not designed to withstand global passive attackers. it tries to
select relays from different AS to create circuits that leave the area
of influence/surveillance of local passive attackers like ISPs or
(smaller) countries.
if you look at the distribution of guard and exit nodes around the globe
(  ), you will notice that quite a lot of
them are positioned inside "western" countries, like the US, Sweden,
Germany or the UK. this means that there is a good chance for systems
that sit at the crossroads (TEMPORA comes to mind) to see all
connections that make up a tor circuit, elevating the scope of said
surveillance system from a local passive attack to a global one. whether
GCHQ and friends have figured out how to stitch TOR connections together
is another question, but they should have access to enough data to
deanonymize a large percentage of all tor traffic.
in regards to evading western surveillance, TOR seems pretty much fucked
unless there was an influx of relays in places that do not cooperate
with the western snooping systems AND that do have secure direct
sea-cables between them. if places like that even exist anymore.
cheers :S

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and Financial Transparency 
Juan Garofalo:
i have to disagree here. TOR is an anonymity network, and those require
a diverse and big user base as what is commonly referred to as the
anonymity set. only if that set cannot be targeted as a group (for
whatever reason), the whole thing makes sense and actually protects
anyone using it.
TOR is in an arms race on the obfuscation front, hence all the hassle
with bridges and so on. if/when using tor is outright outlawed (ohai,
russia?) in your jurisdiction, that is a problem.
right now, the general idea is that if lets say, lawyers, doctors and
priests made a point of using TOR, these "bona fide" groups would
protect the rest of the user base from action against all users since
they are "legally protected", "part of the establishment" or "too much
of a PR disaster as targets".
that being said, yea, there is a problem with the global passive
adversary that we have to assume NSA and "friends" to be. and i don't
really see a viable technical solution so far. not saying there aren't
any, mind you.
beyond the technical realm however, and aside from reigning in the
security deep state that has metastasized throughout the west (which
needs to be done, but it will take a lot of time), what a system like
TOR needs to become more robust in the passive adversary context is
political hacking that makes it possible to run exit nodes in really
diverse places, away from networks owned by corporations with offices in
the Five Eyes member states, because the design does hold merit against
local passive adversaries.

@_subject: [tor-talk] VPS Suggestions for Middle Relay 
if you can at all, try to get a hoster outside of USA, UK and Germany.
those are the countries with the most nodes right now, iirc, and the
further we spread this around, the better for everyone.
my small middle relay is hosted at colorhost.de, they have very cheap
VPS slices (starting at 2?/month), but theres a gentleman's agreement to
not do more than 1TB of traffic per month on those over the long haul.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hiding IP address from my ISP 
basically, what happens is this:
there are firms (or even government entities) that play along in the
bittorrent filesharing of copyrighted material on behalf of the
copyright owners to learn the other participants of the torrent swarm
(since bittorrent is a peer-to-peer file transfer protocol, you can
learn the IP addresses of other people that up/download the torrent as
well). then they look up which ISP owns that IP address and then,
depending on the country/legislation, they either subpoena the ISP for
your email/postal address, or they notify the ISP and the ISP is legally
bound to send you nasty emails and/or cut your connection on repeat
offenses ("three-strikes").
sidenote: those firms likely have to upload the copyrighted material to
the bittorrent swarm as well, they just do not send nasty letters to
if you somehow managed to participate in a bittorrent filesharing swarm
via a VPN, those firms would only see the IP of your VPN server (at
least if everything actually works as intended/advertised). if that
server happens to be in another country were the copyright holder has no
legal standing, they cannot get back at you because the legal system of
that other country allows your VPN provider to not disclose your real IP
address (at least in theory),
there are very few VPN providers that accept actually protect their
customers in that way, even though all of them will claim that they do.
you should look for ones that accept anonymous payments and offer
service from interesting countries (if there are any interesting
countries left, that 3-strikes stuff has been spreading over europe like
a bushfire), but at least the former might change since the
visa/mastercard cartel has started to deny service to VPN providers.
at this point i would love to end with a recommendation for a service,
but sadly, i do not know any. if you find any VPN providers that aren't
running on insecure MSCHAP2, accept "anonymous" money (e.g.
cash-in-a-letter, bitcoin, paysafecard, whatever) and offer service from
jurisdictions that aren't beholden to hollywood, i guess there might be
some people on this list that are interested in that info.
