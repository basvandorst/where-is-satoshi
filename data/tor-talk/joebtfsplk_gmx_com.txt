Not sure what was meant, but would it make * any * sense to include NoScript & then disable most functionality of it?
Huh?  It's early in AM, but which are you advocating - or both?
Others can weigh in on this:  In past, I've had conflicts running QuickJava & Torbutton.  One prob was once toggled Torbutton off, & shut down Tor, QuickJava didn't properly toggle plugins unless restarted Firefox - * at minimum. *  Been a while, but may have had to uninstall / reinstall QuickJava to restore functions.  Plan on trying it again.
How do you get pages to work correctly - such as clicking links to d/l files, if only allow JS on "very few" pages?  Seems to me, more trusted sites than not require some JS to use the sites.  I'm curious, since you said "very few," not "on trusted sites."
Back to QuickJava & NoScript:  Aren't they overlapping - possibly conflicts of using both?

@_subject: Tor network connections constantly building / failing 
Recently noticed Tor being slower than usual & network map shows MANY new connections building, then failing VERY quickly. (within a sec or so).  Does this constantly - one connection after another.  Using Vidalia 0.2.1.26-0.2.9;  Torbutton 1.2.5.
Sometimes there are at least 3 connections open - sometimes not.  1st time I've seen this.
Did close Vidalia / Tor, Polipo, Firefox 3.6.10 & Torbutton, the restart - couple of times - no change.
During the connection, for brief times, D/L speeds may get up to "normal" for me - but not for long.
Anyone noticed this or have suggestions?  Thanks.

@_subject: Tor network connections constantly building / failing 
What I'm seeing is completely ABnormal from what I've seen for 1 - 2 yrs, over several Tor / Vidalia versions.  I often looked at network maps - was never like this.
1)  What I described about connections constantly (RAPID fire - dozens, one after another) building, then immediately after 90% of connections 1st pop up - showing "building" - they immediately fail.  Problem is, so many fail so quickly (in seconds), fair amount of time, there aren't 3 good (open, stable) connections.  Therefore, d/l seems to drop to zero during that time.
2) ** Currently, this behavior does NOT "level off."  It continues as long a Tor / Polipo are running (even a day or more).  Regardless, in past if I ran Tor for 1 hr, I NEVER saw anything close to this.  I don't leave Tor running (for normal browsing) for days at a time.  Never have.
3) Now, my speeds never pick up (for any length of time).

Which address should I send ORIGINAL posts to & which for REPLIES to others' replies?
Q2:  For * current * topics, is there way or site to view discussions - before they show on the archives site?  Not sure if all discussions wind up on archives site & how long takes.
Re: Your questions:  Have home ADSL conn (non static IP). Direct / dry loop DSL w/ AT&T - U.S. - TX.  Unless they JUST changed how they treat Tor connections, probably not the ISP (tho not out of question).
Just d/l & installed Vidalia 0.2.2.17a.  Have VERY limited testing w/ it so far, but the constant, RAPID building / failing of new connections seems to have stopped - for the moment.  Will do further testing.  I haven't tried other connections / open wifi.
Could just be temporary Tor network conditions, but before AND after installing Vidalia 0.2.2.17a, many pages now loading quite slowly vs same pgs in past months (comparing loading same pages on many diff days of wk & time of day).  Only diff on computer is upgrading to Firefox 3.6.10.  My non Tor DSL speeds are still good.

Seems some w/ earlier dates are higher on list than some w/ later dates - even looking at the most recent reply date to that OP.  Maybe I'm not seeing something showing a date really is later than another post's.  Dunno.

The Vidalia 0.2.2.17a pkg seems to be working OK for me ( in & of itself).  Don't think any better speed-wise (for some things) than * when prev. ver. was working correctly * - but will have added security / bug fixes.  Maybe the older ver on my PC had a corrupted file.
I tested d/l speed of * a * file w/ Vidalia 0.2.2.17a - seems fine.  But - for now - some pages seem to load much slower than before (approx same time as d/l speed of test file showed OK).  Not sure why.  Will continue to monitor.

Thanks Justin,
Good info for the future.  Right now, really busy (job search) so went back to stable ver of Vidalia bundle - for now.  Your suggestions may well have solved probs w/ current alpha ver, but from my exper w/ vidalia / tor for couple yrs, this was a new development crashing (multiple times - same apparent reason).  Does suggest alpha ver needs some tweaking (that's why it's "alpha").  If get more time to test, will try your suggestions.  Hopefully, others will find the post useful.

Don't know the answer to most of your questions, but you raise some important ones.  I'm not sure how, even if records of some sites you mention are seized, they could trace directly back to you (a Tor user) - IF using it properly, because all the seized records would show is the exit node's address.

Google / Gmail requires cookies to login. I use a cookie manager addon in Firefox 4. I allowed Google to set temporary cookies, & didn't get "cookies are disabled" message. But, when open the Gmail page in Tor mode, try to login - it gives me the following message (which seems like an idiotic privacy invasion & bad security idea - from user's stand point):
If click on link "learn more about your support options," get this screen:
This problem has been discussed before, but I don't know the real solution, if there is one. Because the Tor exit node (in my case) appears to be in a diff country than one given to Gmail when opened the acct (or the assumed country from my orig IP address), Google thinks it may be someone trying to hack the acct. There may be settings users can change in their acct to have Google (or other providers) to contact in a case like this, other than sending your phone  to verify your identity. Don't think I'll be sending them my phone  I've never seen this or heard of them (or any site) asking users to send their phone  Yes, I'm sure I was on the real Gmail login page - When I set up my acct, I chose "security questions" for verification (or at least if forget my password), but in this case, seems Google isn't using that to verify I'm the real acct owner.
It might be possible to limit relays Tor uses to your country, but never dealt w/ that. Others will know more than me.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Google disable web-access to gmail for Tor-users? 
After the OP's question about Gmail & cookies, I tried logging w/ Tor.  At 1st, I got "cookies disabled" msg.  Then, I used the addon "Cookie Monster" to allow a temporary cookie.
NOTE:  Whether using a cookie mgr addon or Firefox's cookie mgr, I disallow all cookies globally, then allow sites as needed.  Don't know how, if this affects Torbutton's function (assume it shouldn't - but Torbutton obviously wasn't letting Google set a cookie).  Maybe a cookie exception for a site already has to be in firefox permissions file for Torbutton to allow site to set cookies?
I am using Torbutton 1.3.2a.  AFAIK, when active, Torbutton is handling my cookies  (obviously not, or not to Google's liking).  I'm using default settings in Torbutton >Cookies tab.  Is there a specific non default option that needs to be checked?
My about:config entry for extensions.torbutton.xfer_google_cookies is set to true.
I'll show my ignorance - where would the entries for Strict Exit Nodes be entered / stored?
Google has really changed it's login / security login / PW recovery policies & acct settings.  Good, I guess.  But the last issue I encountered appeared specifically related to Tor using a non US exit node (I'm guessing).  May be (new) settings in a Gmail acct that would allow verifying acct (if get the kind of error I did w/ Tor), other than giving them your phone # or resetting PW.

1st I've heard they REQUIRE a phone # to use Gmail over Tor.  Anyone else aware this is the only way?
I'd bet, from the Google message about "unusual activity," it was because the exit node wasn't in the  same country I used when created acct.
Can you expand a little of Torbutton's cookie handling being fixed?  Again, I'm using TB 1.3.2a.
What are the criteria for TB to allow a site to set cookies?

Since I don't retrieve email by phone (certainly not from Google), I'm not going to give them my cell / home   I'm not aware that I have another option for the phone contact, available to me, personally.
Actually, you can also fill out a form online, giving info about the acct that only the acct holder would likely know (though this "form" is several layers deep, to get to). In my experiment, after entering required info, their official statement is, it may take "up to 24 hrs for them to investigate & reply." Must also have previously set up an alternate email address, where they'll send an authorization link. In my 1st attempt at this, took about 10 min to get an email, which would then allow resetting PW.
This whole process is WAY too cumbersome for frequent use - just a learning exercise for me.  It might be easier to find another mail provider that works better w/ Tor.
Yes, & thus my question about where the "StrictExitNodes" commands would be input / stored (maybe for specific country) ?
 From diff options presented (aside from giving google a phone  if one wanted to use Tor w/ Gmail, maybe specifying specific country exit nodes would be fastest way to get into a Gmail acct.  Though won't know if that prevents the "unusual activity" msg from Gmail till try it.  I'll try Tor w/ other email providers to see if works better.  Others can do same & post results.
I am assuming (please correct) that if Firefox's "accept cookies from sites" option is UN checked (cookies denied globally), then for Torbutton to allow a site to set cookies during Tor mode, there MUST already be an exception to allow that site to set cookies, stored in Re: Matthew's comment:
It appears I didn't have an exception to allow google.com to set cookies.  I seldom login to Gmail.  Then, only allow temp / session cookies.   However (for others' info), about cookies.sqlite - appears only persistent cookies are stored in it.  Session cookies are not.  I believe session / temp cookies are stored in memory, unless that's changed in FX 4.
IMHO, if users are worried about privacy in email, they probably should another provider than Gmail.

I've had this Gmail acct since 2007 (that I tried w/ Tor the other day after OP's question).  I've not tried to create any new ones lately via Tor, so you may be right.
What if you don't have a phone # to give them (or don't want to) - they just don't let you create an acct?
In the past, I could use Tor w/ Gmail - assumed they changed policies.
It's pretty nervy (& savvy) of them  to attach a phone # w/ email acct.  Obviously, people are eating it up w/ a spoon.  Their google st. view had a pic of my house w/ car in front - showing license plate.  Had them remove my house.
FYI - I tried GMX w/ Tor couple days ago - worked just fine.
What do you mean by "I just hit dismiss?"  When I tried Gmail thru Tor from a PC, there was no way to "dismiss" the screen.  The only way (I found) around giving a phone, was fill out their "investigation" form, w/ a 2nd email, info about your Gmail acct, then wait for reply.  I didn't follow the link they sent, but assume it'd require resetting PW.  Not a good solution to this prob.
Are you talking about using Tor & Gmail - recently, w/o SMS or other Was this a permanent lift of ban while using Tor?  As in, you never had to ask them again or had problems logging in w/ Tor?

No, it wasn't answered - that I saw.  Thanks.  I know there's a lot on the Tor proj. site about editing torrc file.  I thought it probably went there, but wasn't sure.
I mentioned earlier in another reply, that might be easier to use another mail provider besides Gmail that works w/ Tor, w/o the hassle.  IMHO, if one is concerned about privacy, the last mail provider on my list to use would be Gmail.  Some others aren't much better, but google's straight forward about how they're going to scan your email (and everyone that replies to a Gmail email).  If you have something you want to keep private, don't send it thru Gmail, for sure.  Probably good advice, in general.  Or use encryption.
Some providers claim they don't ever scan mail - but I wouldn't stake my life on them keeping their word.

If there's something diff about logging in w/ Tor that requires 3rd party cookies, I'd be surprised.  Anything's possible, but I'd double check that.  Google's already getting enough w/o requiring 3rd party cookies.

There's a comparison of different webmail providers:  I'm sure there are others.  Many have all the features you mention.  When I started looking for alternatives, was quite surprised how many are avail besides "big 3."
The domain shown for my gmx acct is just gmx.com.  I think even in full header, shows a US origin.  I don't know if there's any stopping an 800 pound gorilla like Gmail / Google.  My guess is Tor users are a tiny % of accts.  Vast majority of most of internet users are clueless about dangers & privacy invasion / data collection - not just w/ Gmail.  Even w/ ongoing publicity of google's privacy violations (some they had to back down on), people still use it.  That's not gonna change.  I'm the world's worst "must beat them (any entity) at their own game" type person.
But Tor users are usually more enlightened compared to gen. pop.  Don't understand clinging to Gmail for dear life.  Point taken about recipients being familiar w/ gmail, yahoo & other familiar names.  If more started using others - even on trial basis - they'd become more familiar names.
Looks like diff users get diff screens, at times, about the SMS  verification and ability to bypass notices.  I / others could try it diff times / ways, but just seems like (for Tor use) might be easier to use another provider.
Even though it's none of their business (there aren't laws requiring them to gather very personal data), for a reason why I was asking to remove my  house from street view, just stated I was law enforcement & was worried about privacy / security of my family.  I need to check if it's still removed.
I'm not pushing any mail provider, but I found creating / deleting accts on GMX very quick.  If using Tor w/ email is a goal, massive storage space w/ a provider probably isn't a concern.  Neither is social networking features, etc.

If I understand some Tor users' reasoning, they want to use Tor w/ email for various privacy reasons AND they want to use "really good services & tie-ins" at the same time?
Plus, some are concerned about having huge email storage while using Tor?  Uh, not sure I understand that.  I must be missing something.  You do know anything stored on their servers isn't private?  My questions here are sincere - trying to learn - why use Tor & email (? on everyday basis ?) AND Gmail?
Presumably, the email contents would only be hidden from ISPs - or perhaps prevented from being intercepted.  The weakest link in chain is everything is exposed to Google.  Maybe I'll learn something about privacy / security by meaningful input why Tor + Gmail are so important.  No offense, but I don't consider "really good services"  or storage, etc., priorities when using Tor (if I was going to use it w/ In some respects, if using Gmail, you may as well take out a front page ad on NY Times.
So why the concern for certain features (vs basic email service) AND Tor compatibility?  Why not use another provider w/ Tor, and a diff one (Gmail, if you insist) for everyday email?
What are a few of the reasons for using Tor w/ email, where it's not just as easy to use another Tor friendly provider?  IMHO, the "brand recognition" issue, especially when using Tor, doesn't make sense.  If you want privacy, Gmail or anything remotely connected to Google isn't the place to be.  Not an opinion - well documented over yrs.  It's like saying, how can I stick my head in a lion's mouth w/o getting bitten?  How about not sticking it in at all?

Point taken.  If I understand, the reason many want to use Tor w/ Gmail isn't for email - other services / options?  Because if they are using it for email, it's not private on Gmail (or a lot of others) - other than your IP address, if can successfully login w/ Tor.
I get "trying to beat the system" - as I often do, but I try to take the path of least resistance.  Aren't most / all of the options, or even better ones (except ones dealing w/ gmail) available directly, instead of going thru Gmail?  Is it just a matter of convenience of having many options / links in ONE place?  Maybe some of those sites won't allow Tor either?  I'm trying to see what I'm missing that can't be found anywhere except through google.
If I wanted to blog  *anonymously *, I wouldn't do it on Google.
Maybe there are SOME just not available anywhere except Google / Gmail???  If I wanted to use google search, I'd use Scroogle SSL.
If wanted to look at youtube, I'd go to youtube.
If I suddenly lost most brain function & wanted to "organize my medical records online," google is the last place on God's green Earth I'd choose - via Tor or not.

Much slower than I've ever seen it unless there was something wrong w/ internet conn in general.  Seems like it started when upgraded (actually did clean install) of latest Vidalia bundle.  Not a one time thing - have tried it on diff days at diff times - always slow.
Software seems to be loading OK - Tor, vidalia, polipo are all running.  Tor chk sites confirm using  Tor exit node.
There's an endless, constantly increasing list of scrubbed circuits - like below.  It just keeps going thru them like a ticker tape.
"Apr 08 14:36:37.277 [Notice] We tried for 15 seconds to connect to '[scrubbed]' using exit 'politkovskaja'. Retrying on a new circuit."
NOTE:  I CAN connect to some sites using Tor - so it IS working, it's just so slow, apparently because of all the scrubbed circuits, it's of no use for anything.
Any ideas what's causing this behavior?  I did uninstall / reinstall tor bundle.  Have closed Tor & browser, then restarted - no joy.

Edit:  I uninstalled / reinstalled Vidalia bundle (once more).  This time I del all files in (Vista) C:\users\\App Data\Roaming\Tor\
Now as soon as start Tor & enable Tor button 1.3.2, pages load fairly I don't think it should be necessary to install / uninstall / reinstall 3 times to get it to work.  I always shut all other prgms before installing.  Though never have problems installing prgms w/ Kaspersky IS 2011 running (it notifies whether it trusts the prgm or not), I shut it down & disconn. from web.
After doing all the above, seems to finally work.  Maybe this will help

Are you saying a "bad" guards can cause an ENDLESS, rapid stream of log entries:   "We tried for 15 seconds to connect to '[scrubbed]' using exit 'xxxxxxxxx'. Retrying on a new circuit"?
When it is doing this (it seems) the listed speed of the 3 nodes in the 1st hop are often listed as high.  Listed speed may mean nothing.  If it * does * mean anything, then that isn't the only problem in my case, because they often show higher speeds. But I digress.
If we're talking about same thing, the entry guard - in Tor Network Map, 1st entry under "connection" column in L pane?  When select that 1st connection, shows 3 nodes in R pane, w/ their IP address, bandwidth, etc.
Early last evening, after reinstalling Vidalia bundle again, I was able to load pages * almost as fast as w/o Tor. *  (yes, I'm sure Tor was working)  I tried a # of pages - all worked well.  Looked at the Vidalia log - didn't see constant stream scrubbed circuits.  It was still quite early & would've been lots of traffic.
Regardless of what the 1st 3 nodes look like, it  *seems * when I'm able to connect to a site - at all - the behavior of an endless stream of scrubbed circuits in the log is NOT happening.
When it IS happening, connecting to any  site (not high traffic ones, or very slow servers) either fails or takes well > 1 min (usually more, IF at all).  Usually, by then it times out.  It's not the site's servers, because can stop Tor & same sites load instantly.
I've tried this on numerous sites, days & times, that I know to usually be fast w/o Tor - or w/o it.  If this was the typical state / function of Tor network, no one would be using it, so I know it can't be happening to everyone on a regular basis.  This is now the norm rather than exception, for me.  As it is, Tor is useless for me > 90% of time (I mean it won't load pages - at ALL).
Today, checked it again & basically can't load pages at all - even though (at times) the 3 nodes in entry guard all show fairly high speeds, while still unable ot load pages.  Again, at times, entry guard changes frequently.  I stopped Tor, wiped the Tor state file (the "lock" file - what ever it can contain - is empty now).  It did cause pages to load much faster - for now.  If "bad" entry guards are the problem AND if happening to most users MOST of the time, like me, I'll need a "clear Tor state file" button addon. :-(
By design, how often does the entry guard (and the 3 nodes in it) change I've noticed at times, mine seems to change quite often - sometimes every 30 - 60 sec or so.  When I AM able to load pages normally (by Tor standards), I don't think the entry guard is constantly changing, but the log definitely does not show a constant stream of scrubbed entries.

Have no particular problem w/ doing away w/ Torbutton - per se.  Two Avg &  users will have to be educated in an * easily understandable * way why they must install a 2nd instance of Firefox (browser bundle).
Have noticed the current & past Tor browser bundles are a Firefox ver or 2 behind the most current release from Mozilla.  How does / will that affect safety of Tor browser bundle users, in case of serious security updates in latest FX vers, which haven't been incorporated into latest Tor?

In the last week, * SOME * of the tor-talk msgs started getting filtered as spam.  I changed nothing, so GMX must've changed their filters / software.  Never happened before now & never when list was at seul.org.
I can't see any diff in msgs that get filtered & ones it still lets through.  One that gets filtered may be by same person on follow up to same topic, where earlier msg didn't get filtered.
I was told creating custom filters to allow msgs to come through in email settings, do NOT work on the Spam folder, once messages are already marked.  Although, when I log into web mail & MANUALLY run the filters on the spam folder, it'll move all that fit the filters to inbox.  But, it keeps filtering some & only delivers a notice thru POP3 that there are new spam messages.  So, filters aren't working consistently on their own.
I'm not sure how to get around it.  Not feasible to add actual email addresses to white list.  Any ideas?

Not sure I understand your question.  Do you mean how can you have installed / run 2 instances of Firefox on same machine?  That, as well as having each use a separate profile, is relatively simple (if you create separate ones & specify which to use).  There are instructions all over the web how to do it.

Don't know if you were replying to the earlier post (that I wasn't sure if he wanted to install 2 versions of FX on his machine).
Why would you want to run several instances of Firefox - SIMULTANEOUSLY?  When I said it was easy to install multiple versions, or multiple instances of same version, didn't expect users would be running them at the same time.  If you are short on RAM / CPU & want different VERSIONS, of course have to install them in diff folders, & set them to use diff profiles (if desired).  But, other than needing to switch between running installations for a specific purpose, no need to have them running simultaneously.  Run one & when thru w/it, shut it down & start the other.
I believe you can also run simultaneous instances of same FX version (most likely using different specified profiles).  Typically, one install will be the default.  Others can be started using specific profiles by adding the profile name (or full path incl profile name) in the shortcut target box, after the path & executable.  Like after C:\......\firefox.exe" -p myprofile4-21-11 -no-remote
This assumes the profile name is already entered properly (or created) in Firefox's profile.ini file.  You can create a new profile name using the profile manager.  The firefox 4 [beta profile mgr] (not yet incl w/ the setup) has more options than one w/ FX v3.x.  I've used it - had a couple minor issues, but over all, allows specifying which installed version will use which profile.

The 2nd one (or 3rd, 4th...) doesn't have to be portable.  I just replied to another user, who I * think * may have been dealing w/ issue of running more than one version, or multiples of same version (though he was concerned w/ RAM).  See that reply & whether it answers some questions.  After you read it, then you'll need to read up on using the Firefox Profile Manager (search that in their knowledge base).
You can read some about the stand alone profile mgr 1.0b1 that replaces the one built into Firefox here:  You can d/l the beta profile mgr here:  I would suggest backing up a copy of the current profiles.ini file before making changes.  Sometimes, I've had to manually add a profile name / path to it, because the profile mgr wouldn't do it correctly.  I copied a previous profile entry from the profiles.ini file & pasted it below.  Then changed the path & profile name accordingly, following the original examples.
Name=FX 3.6.8 test 8-6-10
Path=Profiles/f3pnryzk.FX 3.6.8 test 8-6-10
Path=F:\Mozilla Shared Profiles\Firefox 4\mwfte1rr.FX4-shrd-3-25-11
The "IsRelative" value = 1 means the profile is in the default location;  0 means it's in a non default location (as my Profile 2 is on F:\ drive).
Which ever one you want to be the default will have "Default=1" as last However, if running multiple instances, for the other installs using different profiles than the default one, you'll either have to use the newer standalone beta profile mgr 1.0, or you'll have to add the profile you want each installation to use, in the startup icons Target box, along w/ the command "-no-remote" (no quotes) after the name of the profile name specified.

Been there before w/ older machines, short on resources.  However, situations like yours aren't limited to running multiple instances of any specific prgm - it prevents running several apps at once, not just multiple browsers.  In your situation, only thing is to limit # of apps that auto start in background, & if you need different browser configurations, run one instance at a time.  Kind of a pain to close one browser / profile then start another.  If you haven't already (& do so regularly), stop all unnecessary prgms from auto starting at boot up.  These can eat up precious resources on older machines.
An addon, "Tab Mix Plus" gives more options about saving sessions / open tabs, history, etc., than Firefox's native session restore.  May make it a bit less hassle to close browser, use another profile, close it, & go back to origninal.
Most of the configurations you're concerned about (incl the addons installed) are stored in the profile.  Except for those that have resources & want to run multiple browser instances - at once - one installation of Firefox will suffice, & creating different profiles (then either using Profile Mgr to chose which profile to use at startup, or adding commands which profile to use, after each separate start icon).

The operative word for * low resource * machines is "Simultaneously," as in 2 or more apps running at the same time (any, not just Firefox).  Not whether 2 instances (same version or not) CAN be installed.  I was mainly aiming at low resource machines, how to use diff Firefox versions or diff profiles w/ diff configurations (but only *running* one at a time).
Of course it's possible - that's what I said.  I run 2 diff versions (sometimes at once) - but it's a new machine.  Yes, if one has sufficient system resources, can run multiple instances simultaneously.  For older machine, users will either have to use one Firefox instance at a time, or find & stop enough non essential prgms from auto starting w/ the OS (good idea, anyway).  That still may not free up enough resources to run 2 Firefoxes at once.  Still a good idea & often speeds up older systems considerably.
There are lots of detailed articles on how to create & use multiple profiles, & how to install / use multiple instances of Firefox.  Can find them in Mozillazine forum, in Mozilla knowledge base and 3rd party

Where most users have problems is if they just install a new (or 2nd version) of Firefox (not Tor Browser Bundle, including a modified Firefox), it will use the "default" profile, specified in the profiles.ini file.  I've never installed the TBB, so don't know how it handles profiles.  From what you say, it creates a separate one automatically.  Installing Firefox d/l from Mozilla doesn't create a new profile, if one already exists.  It uses the old one by default, unless you create a new profile (using Profile Manager) & specify that profile will be used by the new FX version (or 2nd install of same vers.).
This is where many avg users become confused.  If they're trying to use 2 instances of the "official" releases of Firefox from Mozilla & have them use diff profiles (for what ever reason).

@_subject: [tor-talk] no country flags in Vidalia 2.10 
Never really payed much attention to country flags in Tor Network map - in Vidalia 2.10 or earlier versions.  But, they don't show up when running Tor under my limited (Vista) acct.
I figured out by looking at the error / message log, that Tor / Vidalia * "couldn't find the "geoip" file" * in the path C:\users\\app data\roaming\tor
because it didn't CREATE the geoip file in the limited user's ...\roaming\tor folder.  It DID create the geoip file in the admin acct, in the path mentioned, but that doesn't help unless you run Tor from the admin acct (generally not a good idea to user admin accts for internet).
Is this a bug in Tor installer?  If I copy the geoip file from admin acct to user acct path, the country flags show just fine, running Tor in a user acct.  But, it shouldn't have to be done manually.
I'm using bundle 2.1.29 / 2.10 - don't know if this issue is fixed in latest Vidalia bundle.
When installing Tor (any prgm) from a limited user acct, Vista of course asks for an admin PW.  But, most prgms install the necessary files to function in the user's acct, so the prgm can access them when later running the prgm from that user acct.  Windows / the prgm installer recognizes which limited user acct is being used when prgm is installed.  Many ask is you want to install the prgm for this (limited) user, or all users.  Tor doesn't ask, AFAIK.

Answer:  No, installing bundle 2.1.30 / 2.12 doesn't install the geoip file in the user's acct - tor data folder path, for the user acct being used when Tor was installed.  It still has to be copied there manually (for me, anyway).

I'm grateful for the work done to create TBB, but the mantra of security experts has always been, "ALWAYS keep your browser / OS updated w/ security patches."
As said, it may be unavoidable (currently) for TBB developers to integrate new FF versions quickly, but surely I'm not the 1st to wonder about security issues of using old browser versions.
The testing bundles Andrew mentioned are fine for, well... testing, but not for general users.  It's a long way & many fixes, from Firefox 3.6 to 5.0 / 5.0.1.

I think their concept is that the "friendly" ISPs will not know the true destination, therefore would not be complicit in allowing users to access forbidden sites. Apparently, after passing through the ISP to the "apparent" destination, Telex diverts the traffic to the "real" destination, based on tags inserted into the request on user's computer. In concept.

Nor for I.  I may be way off, but perhaps they should have used the term "unwitting ISPs," vs friendly.  Workable or not, their concept seems to be that friendly ISPs are any that would rout users' traffic to *any* allowed (non forbidden) site / service.  If I understood, a friendly ISP would think the Telex user was going to Disney.com, but after passing the ISP, on the way to Disney, Telex diverts the traffic to "Death To (your dictator's name here).com" - the Telex user's real destination.  It is a variation on how Tor works.  The ISP only sees you're connecting to a Tor node.
I don't pretend to be an expert on Telex - just the opposite.  But, it seems their concept is similar, except w/ Telex, the ISP thinks you're going to an acceptable site, like "Long Live (your dictator's name here).com", but after leaving the ISP, the traffic is diverted to another site, of which the ISP is unaware.

How so - other than not wanting their corporation to be censored?  Do they have a record of refusing to give data to gov'ts?
Privacy, anonymity & anti-censorship seem interrelated.  Anonymity implies privacy.  Google is in business to make money, not promote anti-censorship or free speech.  Censoring them cuts into their earnings, so yes, they are against censorship - * involving their corporation. *  IMO, if I lived in a country where my life or possible imprisonment depended on internet anonymity / security, I wouldn't trust Google to keep me safe.  I'm quite sure other entities eventually could provide some service / method to access banned sites, w/o $ being the main objective.
Forget Telex or Tor for the moment.  Eventually, individuals or groups have always found an "underground" way around censorship (if they wanted to) during wars, etc., sans the internet.  The answer to avoid censorship may not involve the internet at all.  Ultimately, passing or accessing censored or what gov'ts consider subversive info * through any ISP,* that keeps records & is legally bound to cooperate w/ govt's doesn't seem like the best idea.  I wouldn't go to the NSA's office to have a secret phone conversation.  Just my opinion.

Jimmy, though you have some valid points, I think you missed my point entirely (possibly some other posters').
1.  I wasn't speaking about the US, or any particular country.  I was really thinking of more repressed countries.  And yes, in some of those, people would / might go to jail (or worse) if they were caught accessing or disseminating "subversive" info.
2.  If in a repressed country, one wants to access information / sites that is forbidden by the gov't, one better have ANONYMITY when accessing these.  There may be ways to get around sites (for instance) being blocked.  If so, one better have anonymity when doing so, or they may find themselves at the local police station.  IOW, if one is circumventing a gov'ts' censorship, they better have anonymity.  In those instances, censorship & anonymity are linked.  Often in the really repressed, dictatorship countries, people suspected of subversive behavior just "disappear."  It happens all the time.
Pure anti-censorship (or lifting censorship) assumes that bans on information will be lifted.  That still doesn't mean a gov't isn't watching / logging who's accessing what info, to be used later.

As I understand it, just sending unencrypted mail to an email provider thru Tor, only masks your true IP address.  This assumes you've set up an acct w/ provider, WHILE USING TOR.
Once it hits (Gmail & many others') servers, they're going to scan unencrypted mail, as well as mail sent to you.  If your received mail is unencrypted, providers will scan that.
You can use HTTPS connection & Tor to Gmail, which will hide your IP, provide protection * between you & Gmail,*  but if unencrypted, won't keep them from scanning it.
Yes, I believe an exit node could scan unencrypted mail.  I'm not sure about when you use SSL between you & final destination.  Others can chime in (please correct any mistakes here).
Generally, it's not suggested to send sensitive, unencrypted info thru Tor when using plain HTTP connection w/ a site.
One solution for you might be to use the popular "Enigmail" Tbird addon (from AMO's site) to encrypt mail.  You can read up on it at AMO & Enigmail's home page - what's involved for you & recipients of your mail.  It's not that difficult.

I think we're beating a dead horse & maybe talking about 2 diff things.  I'm not bashing Google - just stating instances of their record.  Yes, they provide lots of free services - including email.  But before one sends unencrypted email to Gmail & quite a few other "free" providers (& also persons replying to email sent thru the "scanning" providers), it'd better be info they don't mind * possibly * the entire world knowing.
I just don't think Google is a good choice to count on to protect your identity (& stake your freedom on, * if living in a highly repressed nation *), even if they do offer valuable services for "free."
I hope other entities will step up to offer the kinds of services you mention, for users in repressed nations - if none exist.  Google's & some other providers' privacy policies are quite dismal from a privacy In the US & some other nations, for now, loosing your freedom isn't an issue - unless breaking some laws.  I was speaking about very repressed nations, where people can be jailed simply on suspicion.  In THAT kind of society, I wouldn't trust Google (OR a lot of others), if offering services you refer to.  In the US & other "free" democracies, invasion of privacy & failure to protect identity are probably the only drawbacks to using Google - & other provider w/ similar privacy policies - for services you mention - unless violating laws.

Zaher, the purpose of Tor (& Telex's model) IS primarily anonymity.  And in opinion of many, anonymity implies privacy.
One issue is Tor or any other anonymity software isn't 100% foolproof.
Yes, many sites are censored by nations.  The purpose of software like Tor & presumably Telex are to keep ISPs (thus gov'ts) from knowing which sites your visiting.  The draw back to that, is some nations have banned accessing Tor nodes.  Whether Telex get off the ground or not, as I mentioned earlier, their concept is (* as I understand *), a censoring nation / ISP would think users were accessing "acceptable" sites (vs accessing a Tor node), & Telex would divert users traffic from the destination (that the ISP sees / logs), after it leaves the ISP to users' real destinations.  The ISP has no idea the traffic was diverted by Telex, or that Telex was involved at all - as I understand.
Thus, making ISPs (& gov'ts) THINK users' are going to acceptable sites.  This is diff than ISPs logging that users are connecting to Tor nodes (if they can), which some nations see as trying to circumvent their censorship.  Whether ISPs would eventually be able to detect traffic is using Telex software is another matter.  I'm not any sort of expert on Telex or Tor.

You will have to either create an acct while using Tor, or when using Tor to access an existing acct (not sure of the value in that - if the acct wasn't created using Tor), or almost certainly have to use an exit node in the same country that you created the gmail acct from (by editing your torrc file to use country specific exit nodes).  Gmail doesn't like it when you try to access an acct from an  address in another country than the one they saw / recorded when the acct was created.  I think they believe it may be a hacking attempt.

IOW, it's not distinguished from any previous post at all, so doesn't appear to be a NEW post or reply.  * Don't know how it appears to others. *  I'm assuming if you wanted to insert comments at specific point, in the middle of previous post(s), you hit enter to start new text that isn't part of previous quoted replies?  Your post / reply is 1st I've seen this on - not sure why.
Since I don't know which email client you have (or using some webmail), can't give specific suggestions.  Usually w/ Tbird, if you place cursor in quoted text, where want to insert reply (& have it show up distinctly from earlier posts), hit enter - it "breaks" the earlier quoted post & makes new text entered very distinct from quoted text.
This is just FYI - if have any questions, please ask.  Maybe I or others can make suggestions.
Another FYI - a Tbird addon I use to help reading msgs w/ multiple quotes is "QUOTE COLORS."  It makes it much easier to keep up w/ what text went w/ which author.  I'm sure other email clients * may * have similar addons.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Any problem installing TBB & Vidalia bundle on same 
My question involves 2 scenarios.
1.  Installing both TBB & Vidalia bundle, so other apps could be torrified if need to close Tor browser.
2.  Install & run TBB & Vidalia bundle simultaneously, so if close TBB, don't have to wait for Vidalia startup to torrify other apps.
Not sure which of these would be more common, at present.
Tor Project is moving away from Torbutton, which is fine - urging use of TBB.  Sometimes I may not want Firefox in TBB open, or may need to close it, which closes Tor.
But, may either already have other apps running, using Tor, or want to start them quickly.
Is there a problem using both - either separately (one active at a time), or simultaneously?
Last, for non browser apps, is there a standard way to check if they're using Tor (say, Thunderbird or other apps), as the check for browsers?

Thanks Phillip.  I'll try that w/ Tbird.  But, still like to know if can install both vidalia bundle & Tor browser bundle at same time (even if not running at same time).
Like you, I might have other apps I want to run thru Tor, but don't necessarily want Tor browser open.  Or if TBB hangs & have to close, then any other apps running thru Tor lose their connection / anonymity.
According to what I've read here, development / security of Tor button is not high priority anymore & trying to phase it out.
However, not having ability to run Tor w/o a browser open has some drawbacks.  You don't need Tor button to user Tor for another app, as long as you can verify it's using Tor.
That's why I asked about installing both.

something like an option / preference "don't close TBB when Firefox closes" sounds like a solution.  Technically, it'd be "don't close Tor / Vidalia" wouldn't it, because "TBB" includes Tor?
Firefox in TBB is dependent on Tor, but Tor (in TBB) doesn't necessarily have to be dependent on Firefox running.
Installing both, & running one, shutting it down, starting the other is doable, but kinda pain.

Thanks.  How "experimental" are they?  They are alpha releases, after all.  For most software, alpha releases are only intended for testing (most developers stress that point).  For something involving privacy / anonymity (depending on where you live), is using an alpha version for every day use advisable?  Yes, Firefox 6 fixes security issues, but TBB is alpha.
I've always wondered about Tor Project's (perceived) different opinion that users should switch to a , b versions - vs. other developers' caution about using them.

Thanks.  In this case, I understand about FF 6 & Tor Project wanting to move to it.  Re:  Tor w/ FF 6.  Firefox 6 fixes known issues.  The main purpose of Tor is anonymity, not protecting against browser attacks - yes?  (though using the latest browser is good, for browser safety).  But, isn't using an in thoroughly tested Tor version more risky from an anonymity point - ?  (the risk level depending on where you live, i.e., "what's the worst that could happen if I get found out").  For people living in highly repressive countries, would the bigger concern be relatively assured anonymity, visiting an anti gov't site or preventing  a browser attack?  For me, it might not be a big issue - not so sure about some other countries.

I didn't read the entire article yet, but have read of some similar claims like
Even if partly true, this is one reason I don't understand why TBB has default settings to allow all cookies, seeing as how its main goal is anonymity.  Devs are very concerned about not writing anything to cache, but not concerned about cookies.
Tor wasn't developed for constant, everyday use by millions w/ the idea that anonymity could be provided for the masses.  It probably never will achieve that.  Authorities & hackers will always be looking for holes.  People much smarter than me say if you're that concerned about true anonymity, you'd better encrypt everything.  Cookies & browsing history are another matter.
Under current US & other nations' laws, it's possible that gov'ts have already forced developers of any software -  incl. Tor - to put in backdoors.  And in fact, say it's illegal for the devs of any software to outright disclose such.  In general, most gov'ts aren't going to allow devising ways that criminals can easily & completely avoid detection.  (No, Tor isn't only used by criminals - but gov'ts don't care).  And if they determine such software / networks could provide 99.9% anonymity, w/ no way for them to crack it or no backdoors, they'd probably outlaw it.
I don't know that it has happened w/ Tor, but it certainly has in other cases.  If you want true anonymity, don't use the internet, unless you're very well educated in all things related to internet anonymity (hard for one person to do), and taking extreme, well founded measures to thwart those seeking to identify you or your location, gather info, etc.  Plus, it would be a full time job constantly testing your methods & keeping up w/ newest ways others could crack your system.  A handful of people might have the ability (& almost none the time) to do this.
Could you clarify the question?  As Phillip mentioned, Tbird can be Torrified, but I've never been impressed or convinced that the methods are fool proof by any means.
Web beacons (web bugs) can be stopped in a few ways, that is probably more reliable than any overall anonymity on the web.

I applaud this concept.  I'm sure that would be the intent of those working w/ Tor Project.  Unfortunately, the state of affairs in world gov'ts security "laws" is such that many gov'ts simply have to claim that something is "vital to national security," & it immediately becomes very secretive.  We are already there, Andrew.  Don't need "no stinking warrant" or a reason.  Yes, someone could blow the whistle on a forced backdoor, or anything else - BUT they likely could face prosecution, trumped up charges or plain old governmental personal sabotage.  Just read news stories.  For ANY organization facing pressure from a gov't, it'd come down to whether they were willing to sacrifice their freedom (or at least sanity) for themselves & family.  Think this is conspiracy theory?  This type of behavior of diff gov'ts world wide is well documented ALL throughout recorded history.
I'm not sure why the doubt about gov'ts forcing backdoors.  It's already happened in other cases.
Agreed.  But, it's a LONG, uphill battle.  Correct - people w/ damaging knowledge often disappear, "commit suicide" or are completely discredited by intense propaganda.  Also, it's a fact that any advanced gov't is going to take every step to prevent its real or perceived enemies from being able to freely & anonymously plot & exchange information.  Isn't that part of their function?  Gov'ts around the world already monitor a huge amt of open internet activity & email.  Most people & "dumber" state enemies have become oblivious to this fact.  I can't imagine gov'ts being so stupid & negligent to just leave  *anything * like Tor alone, whether anyone outside of a gov't knows about it or not.

Using addon Better Privacy can eliminate Flash info after session or anytime you choose.  One thing - these settings are stored in a cookie - not config file - on your computer.  Craftily, that cookie also stores list of sites you've visited.  AFAIK, if del the default LSO (settings.sol) cookie, the settings are deleted along w/ sites visited.

Good point.  I think you're right.  They may have to go WAY underground.  Everyone knows several countries have already outlawed Tor & other internet uses / sites.
Julian Assange was way to visible to carry out his mission, whether one agrees w/ his agenda or not.  If gov'ts can't stop persons / organizations they deem embarrassing or threats because of free speech rights, they'll invent other charges against them.
Again, I just can't see many gov'ts leaving Tor alone, when (unfortunately) it * presumably *allows "combatant enemies" to easily communicate anonymously.  Democratic nations may not ban it, but they have to protect their national security & they won't sit idly by while terrorist groups thumb their noses at security agencies.  It's unfortunate that the use of Tor for true, non-violent free speech & access to info & it's use for more sinister purposes get mixed together.
It was once unthinkable that US & other free countries would listen in on potentially all citizens' conversations or read private mail (electronic or paper) w/o court warrants, but it's here & so far, people pretty much accept it.

Using latest stable Vidalia / Tor bundle for Win (Vista x64).
Never really had this prob before installing latest ver, but could be coincidence.  When using Tor/ Torbutton, only one site gave message (to the effect) "the IP address you're using has been determined to be abusing this site ? / server ?.  Access denied."
Then it showed the full IP address.  I could never get that site to stop showing that same, blocked address, no matter what I did.
Tried closing the tab in Firefox.
Then tried closing Tor & Firefox, restarting.  Same msg from site, w/ same IP address shown.  Also, tried refreshing the Tor network, so all new nodes.  Made no diff.
After doing the above (& site still showing old IP address when I opened a new browser tab, then tried site again) I checked my ACTUAL current exit IP address by going to a Tor check site.  As I figured, it showed a diff IP address than the blocked site was still showing, at the very same time as I checked at Tor check site.
Somehow that old IP address was being stored somewhere, even though it was no longer the exit address being used in Tor network.  How / why did the site keep showing the old address after doing all those steps?
Is there an easier way to deal w/ this problem than the many steps I took?  Thanks.

I am using Torbutton.  It is supposed to Torrify Firefox - yes?
1) Sorry, should've mentioned clearing cache.  It couldn't have been (in this case) Firefox cache, because on one 'test,' I closed the site's tab AND _cleared Fx cache_.  Were no cookies involved.  Still same denial.
2) Using Torbutton, in Preferences>Security Settings>Cache, "_block Tor disk cache & clear all cache on Tor toggle_" is checked by default.  Implies Tor is ?? using memory cache?
There is a 2nd setting, "block disk and memory cache during Tor"
The Torbutton Design Documentation says Opt. 1 - above,
I confirmed Torbutton enabled does set "browser.cache.disk.enable" to false.  So when Torbutton is enabled, no cache in Fx.  Therefore, the "clear all cache on Tor toggle" must be talking about Tor mem cache (I Torbutton Preferences description (for the 2 above ):
3) I'm sure I closed Fx, so that would've closed Torbutton & (since mine is set to default) cleared all cache.  Even though don't have Torbutton's "Block disk & mem cache during Tor" check, when I closed Fx & manually cleared it's cache, all disk & mem cache should ? have been cleared.  At the time, was trying to clear every cache I could think of Why, after getting all new nodes & especially new exit node IP address (I confirmed was a new address), would Tor send an _old IP address_ (? from memory) to the site?  Doesn't make sense.  If Tor WAS sending an old address (to any site) after getting new exit address, something's really wrong.  Doubt that's the case.
Further, for Torbutton FAQs:
Not sure about the referrer spoofing - don't think it's relevant here.  Torbutton default is to disable sending referrer header - has nothing to do w/ an "old" IP address.
SafeCache:  Don't know what this Torbutton FAQ is implying.  If Torbutton disables Fx from disk caching, & if Torbutton "block Tor disk cache..." option is checked - what's left -memory?
I don't know that SafeCache does anything w/ memory cache in any manner.  So, I'm confused why Torbutton page is recommending it.  Is the _Torbutton_ page assuming _only_ using Tor w/o Torbutton (which, by default, disables disk caching)?

Thanks.  I can see turning off Polipo as a test, but IF it turns out to be the problem, wouldn't that warrant opening a bug ticket?  After all, it really shouldn't be sending addresses no longer valid (or allowing sites to access the old info) - yes?  I'd rather not have to stop using Polipo completely.  It has a lot of useful functions.
I'm not aware of "hidden" cache in Polipo - others may know more - please chime in.  Given it's only happened on one site (this was a free, completely open site), maybe it's a fluke.  I really thought others would've seen a lot of same problem.  Apparently not.  I'll try to recreate problem & make notes as go thru ea step of trying to clear caches, closing apps / processes, etc.

Good point.  Don't know if Fx is fixed on that.  Can check.  But, that's not only benefit of using Polipo.
This just in!  I discovered Polipo wasn't configured to start w/ Tor, as of today.  Don't know what happened.  When install the bundle, usually sets up Polipo up automatically (did in past Vidalia bundle vers.).  So, set it up thru Vidalia UI "Settings."  Restarted Tor, & Polipo did start.  Went to the trouble site - got the same msg again:
Any idea what this really means?  Searched web for above string - found nothing.  Don't think the msg has anything to do the the specific address, but fact it's coming ? from Tor, or some other info being w/held from the site, that they won't allow access unless missing info is given?

I tried again & this time got on the site.
Shut down Tor.
  "        "     Firefox - cleared cache.
Restarted Fx & Tor w/o Polipo or Torbutton enabled - accessed site OK.
Shut all down again, as above, & restarted FX, Tor w/ Polipo but Torbutton disabled - accessed site OK.
Repeated shut down & clearing cache,
Restarted Fx, Tor, Polipo & Torbutton - accessed site OK.  Checked what IP address Tor exit node was using - diff, of course, from one shown above that was blocked.
Seems site blocking access is related to _specific IP addresses_?  There ARE no differences in setup of my Tor / Pol. / Torbutton today (when site access successful) as other day when blocked.  One GOOD thing learned is by following all shutdown steps above, seemed to be able to stop same (old, incorrect) IP address being accessed / given to site.  Other day, must've been something about sequence of shutdown / clearing cache that didn't clear the old IP address.
UNKNOWN:  When installed latest Vidalia bundle few days ago, did NOT check to see if Polipo was installed / running.  My guess is it WAS, because today the reason I checked on Polipo is Fx would NOT connect w/o it.  Common problem for many - get msg to effect, "firefox is refusing to connect... blah, blah."

Hide your IP address from recipients or from your ISP?  Possibly if you give some info about specifically why you want to hide your IP address in email, someone could make suggestions based on your goals.  Are you trying to hide your IP address, or communicate securely (not the same).  Latter can be achieved by many methods - some quite simple, like encrypting a text doc & attaching to email, or using some email service that uses encryption - like Hush Mail.
on any internet communication that's private / secure, both parties (or a user & a website) both need to use the same technology or "privacy software," if both want to have same security / privacy.
I'm really not sure about the hiding IP address when using email over Tor, (others more experienced should know), but if there is a need for your correspondents to also hide their IP's, they'd also have to use some service or software.  They wouldn't HAVE to use Tor, but if they don't use something, their real address will be visible to email servers Check out Tor article   It doesn't cover evolution, but would give some tips.

@_subject: [tor-talk] When to use and not to use tor. 
I'm not a guru in this dept - only what I've read.  Reason usually given not to use Tor for Banking is because the Tor exit node has to send unencrypted data to your target site (like bank PWs).  Unless your communication w/ that site was somehow encrypted (& a login PW wouldn't be).  A malicious exit node operator could sniff the packets coming thru the relay.
Just visiting a site where you're not required to enter private data doesn't allow a malicious exit node operator (or anyone else) to capture private data.  In the case of banking, instead of just making a direct connection between you & the bank https (using SSL / TLS), using Tor is introducing an "unknown" 3rd party.  That's basically  why.
Same thing w/ unencrypted email.  An exit node could intercept it (though by far, most don't), but if it's really confidential info, don't send unencrypted email thru Tor.  If it's that confidential, you might out to encrypt email anyway.  There are services (like Hush Mail) - for max privacy, I'd opt to install their software vs doing everything on their servers.
Also a Firefox addon, Enigmail that allows using open PGP (GNU PG) encryption in a client like Thunderbird.  Haven't used it, but been thinking of checking it out.

@_subject: [tor-talk] When to use and not to use tor. 
You are correct Seth.  I misspoke when I said login info on an encrypted site would not be encrypted - it would be.
I'm not sure of the answers to questions I'm posing - but they are good Note, there are significant differences of the cipher strength of encryption used on different HTTPS site - even financial institutions.
How hard would it be for a exit node operator to crack your (captured) encrypted PW?  Depends.  If a Tor exit node can capture a packet (and they can), what prevents them from using sophisticated software, available to any 14 yr old, to try & crack the encryption?  They do know the packet was headed to SomeBank.com.
If Fernan's goal is anonymous online banking, I guess he'll need to use some proxy.  What does anonymous banking mean - not wanting your ISP to know which bank sites you use (even if they can't see encrypted data)?  Once logged in, the bank pretty much knows it's you.
Just a thought - what if one logged directly into their bank's encrypted site - using no proxy & their site was hacked (their site, not your computer).  Or something goes wrong using a 3rd party of any kind to log into bank's site, and you tell them / they find out, "I was using Tor (or other) to login & the 3rd party intercepted my info."
In which case is the bank likely to be more sympathetic?  I don't know that using Tor or other proxies enhance security of  logging into secure sites at all.  AFAIK, Tor is intended to increase anonymity, not security.  There are regularly many, many new posts & articles about ongoing experiments on capturing & evaluating Tor traffic (and I'm sure other proxies).  What was impossible yesterday is often common tomorrow.
HTTPS would protect it from an exit node, but not from from the email provider or from gov'ts of most technologically developed countries.  If you want to be sure others besides the recipient aren't reading your email, use encryption.  Even then, unless you're sure what the recipient will do w/ it, or their level of computer security, don't send anything in email you might not want others to read.

Thanks.  I'll plead (somewhat) ignorant.  What's the diff - if any - between "using the STARTTLS" command & choosing "use TLS/SSL" under Server Settings>Connection Security in email client (i.e., Thunderbird).  That's assuming _email server(s) use this & instruct to set up email client w/ these settings_?
When you say, "you can use the STARTTLS command," it indicates manually entering the command - thus, my orig question - where would it be used if simply using an email client?
Is the command necessary or just redundant if email client and email servers you're are using TLS / SSL for POP3 / SMTP?

Don't know if this is your problem, but bet it's a prob for many.  I've noticed when installing Tor / Polipo / Vidalia bundle (not browser bundle) that installer does NOT add ANY info in the Vidalia settings screen, under General Tab for the  "Proxy Application (optional)" boxes, if I'm using Polipo.  My experience is, if I'm using Polipo, entering proper info in these 2 boxes is MANDATORY, not optional.
The installer left these boxes blank for several versions now, for me.  Even when Tor bundle is installed to default C:\ location.  Tor / Firefox will NOT make a connection for me, when they are blank.  Many versions ago, installer auto - filled in the boxes - now, it doesn't even for full install to default location.
I must manually enter this string in "Start a proxy application when Tor C:\Program Files (x86)\Vidalia Bundle\Polipo\polipo.exe
Also must enter this in "Proxy Application  Arguments:" box:
-c "C:\Program Files (x86)\Vidalia Bundle\Polipo\polipo.conf
W/O the 2 strings above, Firefox will not make a connection for me.  Don't know if others (using Polipo) have had same problem.  If so, may be a bug.

You've GOT to be kidding.  Tell me that's a mistake.  Tor Project, dedicated to privacy & anonymity, takes $ from DoD & Sam?  While the US spies on it's citizens, unconstitutionally?  That's rich.
Honestly, this enlightenment will make me reconsider ever using Tor for anything I don't want sent directly to DC.  It's like trusting car magazines' reviews that get their advertising $ from car manufacturers.  There is no way the fed is going to give $ to any "privacy" organization w/o wanting something (cough, back door) in return.  Every ISP has been forced into violating users' privacy.  Why would Tor project, after taking $ from Sam, be any different?  OK users, go ahead & stick your head in the sand.
EVEN if it's not true, for me, Tor project has lost a good deal of its credibility through its associations.  Of course, no government would ever lie & neither would a company (AT&T, Ford, Google, R.J. Reynolds...).

1st, thanks for the refresher, Paul.  I'll bet most users didn't know Tor was started by the NRL.  Unfortunately, for many, that won't ease their minds much.
I don't have the knowledge & skills to check Tor's source code & bet well > 90% of users don't either.
I know (knew) my comments on Tor being funded (or started) by any Fed organization would not be well received.  Neither were the handful of people w/ inside knowledge after 9-11 attacks, shouting there was no justification in attacking Iraq.  They were shouted down & quickly labeled as unpatriotic.  Even today, surveys show a significant percent of people still believe Iraq was responsible for 9-11 attacks.  "Don't confuse me w/ facts - I've already made up my mind."
Again, WHY would Sam develop or fund technology that would make it possible for * their enemies *  to communicate anonymously and privately, possibly allowing them to plot against him, with ABSOLUTELY no way to decipher that communication?
It's a serious question.  Please save the "check the source code yourself" comments.  Open source code means literally nothing.  Did it mean anything when Iraq cracked down on Tor users?  Researchers often show that.  What makes this project different than other govt funded projects?  (This seems like the, "It'll never happen here / to us" It * IS * happening to us in pretty much every aspect of citizens' privacy.  That's no secret.  What makes Tor any different?   If one govt can figure out how to identify Tor traffic, so can others.  Above ALL else, govts NEVER reveal the full extent of their intelligence capability.  That would be foolish.
I've never known Sam to get involved in, or fund something - especially like this - * w/o wanting something in return.*  Ever.  WHETHER or not they make known, to anyone, what they want or intend to do.  It's been shown for over 50 - 60 yrs (probably much longer) that even people in charge of entire govt projects (or govt funded ones), often don't know the  *full* extent of what's being done w/ the research, technology, info, etc.  If you want to ignore history, go ahead.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Iran cracks down on web dissident technology 
1st, a note.  I appreciate everyone's reply.  If some want to be a bit insulting or sarcastic, that's OK.  I'm not highly technically savvy in source code, but I've lived a long time & know a lot about typical modus operandi of many govts.   I've read all up thru Klaus Layer's post.
2nd, my reference to a TRUE back door in open source software was fairly tongue in cheek.  However, * software is only part of the the Tor system.*  Responders are assuming I meant the ONLY way * any * govt could "crack" Tor is thru the software itself (or a back door, etc.).  That's not what I meant at all - sorry if I gave that impression.  There are lots of exit nodes, for * one * instance.  There's lots of eaves dropping on exit nodes.  There are probably ways inconceivable to most, how govts could get info from Tor communication.  Tell me this:  what other form of communication is off limits anymore in many counties, that govts monitor (constitutionally or not)?  I am NOT anti-govt, nor am I completely blind.
Axiom (or should be):  advanced governments have far more technological ability & capability than 1) anyone knows; 2) the govtS (not just ONE ) will EVER reveal; 3) than any university, institution or other very smart individual or group will necessarily be able to detect, or certainly prove.  Most of these are probably in the best interest of However, I feel comfortable saying, those thinking they know exactly what govts are / are not technologically capable of, are deceiving themselves.  They call them "Top Secrets" for a reason.
Fact:  Even if someone discovered any govt successfully monitoring something like Tor, if they CHOOSE to, most any govt can shut down "whistle blowers," university / private research, etc., on anything they consider of national security, in an instant.
Maybe, but I'm asking why any govt would create a system that it can't control, that could be used by its enemies to do as much or more damage, as the good the govt gets from it?  That's one HUGE problem w/ the concept that DoD / NRL created or continues funding anything * like * Tor (not JUST Tor).  If they truly have no way of figuring out who's using a communication method, what users are saying or any other means of identifying something about (Tor) users , they have created & still funding a WEAPON for the enemy to use against them.  Can't help wondering about that.
You can't have it both ways.  Either they can't & enemies are using it (or similar) to plot against MANY govts, or they can & users in "free" countries don't have nearly the privacy they think.  Is the DoD / NRL that stupid?  Possibly - don't know.  But if those saying it is basically impossible for any govt to get useful info from Tor communication are indeed correct, it defies logic any govt would do such a thing.  Or is it that they shortsightedly created something they thought would only benefit them, & now the enemy is using it against us?  Pandora's box is open?
One or 2... poorly researched?  Over several yrs, I think there're numerous reputable instances of serious flaws discovered in Tor.  Sure, they're patched when announced & confirmed.  I'm also sure it will be an ongoing problem, hence part of my concern.
Paul, it's NOT just the software - I'm sure that's regularly, independently examined.  ONE thing no one knows, for instance, is what capability govts have once communication leaves exit nodes.  Advanced govts aren't prone to shooting themselves in the foot.  What some are indicating or at least intimating here, is the US created something (maybe unintentionally) the enemy can NOW use against many countries AND they are still funding it.  Does that make sense?  Not to me - w/o some reasonable facts, such as why enemies can't use it against govts.

I appreciate your comments & the work of all involved w/ Tor.  I read the papers you linked, though I've seen most of the material in various Perhaps you should, because at least one govt seems to be steering the boat.  Therein lies the problem (not you, specifically).  My comments & MAINLY questions, weren't about typical or even very sophisticated adversaries.  They concern WHY any govt would continue funding an anonymous communication project that in today's world, very real enemies can use against said govt, in a very real way, if the govt has no way to monitor it?  One should ask, "Why would they do that?"  It doesn't make sense unless there's more to the story.  Also, in terms of adversaries against something like Tor, any advanced, well funded govt dwarfs the most sophisticated adversaries.  Many govts have unimaginable technology & resources as well as legal (or not so legal) authority to demand info (from ISPs, etc.) that no typical adversary would.
The threat models, discussion of thwarting various attacks, safety in numbers, etc., are all based on assumptions like, 1) the adversaries don't have unlimited time, resources & $.  That assumption is out the window if an adversary is a large govt.
2) The adversary doesn't have access to (some) info going IN and OUT of a network like Tor.  Not valid for a govt.  They can get what they want from ISPs - and have.  The info may be encrypted going in, but they can see you're accessing a Tor node.  A large govt could ALSO monitor every single exit node (& may).
There's NO comparison between people looking at open code, universities or organizations doing small studies on flaws in Tor, etc., and capabilities of a large, advanced govt.  So please, I'm not talking about how many people or universities look at Tor.
Advanced govts no doubt have incredible technology regarding breaking encryption.  Not a typical adversary.  Since Tor was developed BY a govt, and since many talk about one of its greatest values is to allow people in "repressed" societies to communicate freely, the adversary those users need to be most concerned about, is probably the one MOST likely to breach Tor's anonymity.  I doubt most people think Tor's main purpose is to hide communication between two cheating spouses.
A govt helped develop Tor for SPECIFIC reasons (we probably don't know all of them) & still funds it.  Then for users around the world counting on Tor for protection from their govts, the govts would have to be considered as one of the main adversaries to Tor.  Either the US is really dumb for developing a system, perfect for enemies to use against them (kinda doubt that) or there's more to the story.
I don't pretend to know the answers, but know when to ask questions.  For all I know, the US wants the enemy to use Tor for plotting, thinking they're anonymous, when they're not.  No one's answering my specific questions, possibly because if they knew them, they'd be in top level govt positions, sworn to secrecy.  For those doubting any of this has any merit, are you still waiting for them to find WMDs in Iraq?

Please, please - everyone (probably including me) is making the topic  way more complicated than my main question.  No one's addressed the main question.  If there's no answer, that's fine.  Forget conspiracy theories.  If you have a plausible, possible explanation to one question, great.
Why would any govt create something their enemies can easily use against them, then continue funding it once they know it helps the enemy, if a govt has absolutely no control over it?  It's that simple.  It would seem a very bad idea.  Stop looking at it from a conspiracy standpoint & consider it as a common sense question.
Number 1 & 3 on your list are either fact or common knowledge.
# 2 - I didn't say govts ONLY act out of self interest.
# 4 is very likely for large govts - espec. for something like  (electronically) monitoring internet traffic / email, listening to phone calls.  These actions are well documented in several countries.  It's not conspiracy - was well documented & investigated by US Congress & covered in documentaries.  Fact, not conspiracy.  How does that behavior relate to Tor?  Don't know - that's the question.

No idea why funding from one source is an issue.  Not a requirement for an organization or project to do well or go south.
Some of Watson's, Gregory's & Kasimir's possible explanations are at least plausible.  They may not be correct, but who's to say - & they didn't require conspiracy.
I'm not quite as naive as some seem to think.  When I refer to "govt(s)", I mean which ever dept(s) are involved in a specific endeavor.  Even diff depts involved in same project may not agree.  That's weakly related to my question.
The point about supporting the Taliban is well taken.  That's happened many times.  So are several others - like govts in general, making bad One of my main questions was about, if Tor is * indeed * anonymous to govts in general, it is one of the most powerful tools for terrorist groups (not nations).  Now, if one wants to argue that govt agencies being able to communicate w/ whomever outweighs terrorist groups being able to communicate openly, constantly, w/o fear of intercepted info - how can I argue?   I'm not sure  most advanced countries are that stupid.  Don't know the answer, but know there's usually more than meets the eye.
Doesn't matter who ALL funds Tor (or any project); what matters is who is / can do what w/ the technology or info.  It's great lots of people fund it, but doesn't prove anything one way or other.
Saying that there's a possibility govtS know (or can do) more about intercepting ANY kind of anonymous communications than the developers, universities, private researchers THINK that govts know, is no more a conspiracy theory than the (now) fact that individuals or depts working on the A bomb did not know what the other depts were doing, or how it would all fit together.  That was for the purpose of national security.  They would be the same w/ Tor or anything other technology - protect the national security.
To say the same thing as in WWII hasn't repeatedly happened or won't continue to, is naive - for Tor or anything else.  I DON'T KNOW if ANY govt, anywhere can intercept Tor communications.  *If*  they could, I know no govt(s) agencies or developers would be allowed to say so.  Like I said, it's a hard sell.  People are still waiting for WMDs to be found "over there," because that's what they were told.

Very interesting, Michael.  You were a part of it (or knew of it) & it was because govt intelligence (you are aware many - not me - call that an oxy moron:)) wanted a system they could use for various purposes, where the source & destination can't be determined by one of the mid points?
That does make sense.  BTW, I never said conspiracy - others did.  Besides, many use the word or concept incorrectly.  A govt developing technology to use in defending the country isn't a conspiracy.  Covering up illegal activities, for instance, would be a conspiracy (like Watergate).  If some govt has figured out how to "decode" Tor traffic (or use it to great advantage) to thwart terrorists, that's not conspiracy.
I'm going out on a limb to say that US intelligence does not believe Tor gives terrorists a great advantage - for what ever reason(s), or else they'd shut it down, or at least stop funding it.  But then, we & other countries continue supplying arms to groups in various conflicts, which they often shoot back at us.   That said, it may be an earlier poster's comment about lack of foresight may apply.  It would seem that enemies *might* benefit from it as much as govts, unless govts are capable of more than many think they are.  No one, except people w/ high level clearance (perhaps various countries) knows the full answer to that, and they're not talking.
They thought the A-bomb was a good idea & no other country would get the technology.  Huh.  I was on the fence on that one.
It *may* be much like other ideas, such as the famous introduction of cats to an island, where they had no natural enemies.  It almost destroyed the island's eco system.
For "what did you think might happen" sorts of things that individuals & govts do, I now reference them as "Introducing Cats to an Island" principles.  Ideas that sound good at 1st, except for forgetting to ask (and seriously ponder) the most important question of all, "What's the worst that can happen if we..."

That's great.  At the same time many govts allow mobile providers to track users, even by longitude / latitude.  If mobile providers have the technology or are allowed to, so can govts.

I am a little concerned though, about the US violating the constitution in numerous ways to spy on citizens in numerous ways.  (remember the congressional hearings on telephone & internet?)

A week or 2 ago, several had quite a discussion on accessing gmail accts (I could not - at the time), creating new accts, verification requests, etc.
I believe Erin said (she ?) could login successfully by limiting exit nodes to same country as used when acct was created.
I can confirm that worked for me - at least a couple of times, so far.  Once I set the ExitNodes {cc} (where "cc" is your country code) & used the "StrictExitNodes 1" commands in torrc file, I could login to an existing gmail acct.  Of course, aside from keeping a local ISP from intercepting ? something from goggle acct packets (or hackers intercepting in transit), there's no secrecy in accessing any acct w/ Tor (ESPECIALLY involved w/ google), unless it was CREATED via Tor.  Unless one managed to completely hide their true IP address / country, etc. when creating the acct.
So, logging in isn't the true privacy issue - creating an acct - via Tor - W/O providing a cell / phone # is the issue.  I never read any definitive conclusions in the discussion whether new Google, Gmail, YouTube acct could be created (in U.S.) w/o SMS authentication.  If you don't have a cell phone, or don't want to give them your cell / landline # (who wouldn't want to???), I never read a consensus of if & how it could be done.
It seemed diff people got diff screens / menus when they were going thru the whole process.   Some said they just "by passed" the authentication request screen.  Others (like me) weren't given an option to bypass such screens, if trying to create a new acct (w/ or w/o Tor).

or:  ExitNodes {cc},{cc},{cc}  (no spaces after commas and next entry)
By default, if you d/l a CSV list from a Tor status site (or other), when data is copied to most text editors (even like Notepad++), there is a space automatically added *AFTER an entry* and BEFORE the comma in front of next entry.
In other words, the default formatting is "entry, space, comma, entry..."
NOT, "entry, comma, space, entry.

There's no such thing as a free lunch.  FYI - for the all - trusting users of "free" email providers, don't give your real information.  There's no upside & lots of potential very bad down side.  As far as the relatively new practice of Goggle & ? others ? asking for a cell # in some cases to verify your identity, any data they ask for as backup security measures (like security questions), or a phone # is stored in a data base.  Other than them getting a phone # for marketing purposes, having additional security questions would probably provide sufficient security if they suspect "suspicious behavior" before one actually logs in.  If someone actually gains access to your acct, then a provider having a phone # is irrelevant (unless they show it in your acct).  If the phone # is shown in acct settings (don't know - never gave them one), hackers gaining access now have that.
If hackers get in your acct, security is out the window.  If they're trying, but being asked for backup ID info, many types of info would provide sufficient security.  Their argument is probably, "the user has to physically possess the (cell) phone to receive security related correspondence from the provider."  Maybe, but I imagine the real reason is to get around the telemarketing "no call" laws.  Once you have an established "business relationship" w/ a company (by signing up for their service & giving an address, valid phone  technically they are exempt from no - call telemarketing laws.
Security questions provide no marketing advantages for them.  Note:  I never give "normal" answers to security questions.

If users give Yahoo, Google (or services marketing through them) an SSN, good luck.  There's probably no end to amount of junk mail you'll receive based on your credit scores.
Don't write anything in email that you wouldn't want the world to know, unless 1st compose it outside of their websites & then encrypting the file, before sending by email.
Companies w/ these types of policies scan your friends' correspondence with you, as well as yours.  Don't write anything in "normal" email that you wouldn't want the world to know.  Why this practice is deemed legal in some countries, don't know.  By contrast, persons have been prosecuted for "hacking" into their spouse's email.
A lot of people correspond w/ doctors, lawyers by email.  Do you really want that type of info being "analyzed" (& info stored "for future use")?  There should be some "expectation of privacy" for email, but there isn't.  Unless you want to catch a cheating spouse - then you might be prosecuted.

If many, make sure settings in Polipo are correct  - & Polipo is running.  Also, if using Firefox, d/l latest Torbutton alpha ver from Tor Project site.  It will set the Tor proxy settings correctly in FX.
If using IE... don't.  Seriously, you can configure IE to work, but using Firefox is safer.  Or, just d/ l the Tor Browser bundle, w/ pre config'd Firefox included.
Can install it to a separate folder than other Fx installs.  to be able to run  a 2nd instance of Fx, create a separate profile for the Tor Browser.  Then in Properties of desktop icon, in the Target box, after the executable file, add the profile name & no remote command:   \firefox.exe" -p fx-shrd-7-22-10 -no-remote

I don't have a facebook acct, so not positive.  Often, pages won't let you log into acct if your Tor exit node is coming from a diff country than one you signed up with.
Some have success by using the ExitNodes command in Vidalia torrc file & using the same country code as when acct was created.  If want to be sure it only uses exit node from the country specified, use the StrictExitNodes 1 command after the ExitNodes.  See the "manual" link on Tor projects documentation page.

Yes, as stated before, you can edit the torrc file in you user's profile, Vidalia folder, to use only countries specified by you, using the "ExitNodes {cc}" command, where {cc} is the country code you want.  To make sure it uses exit nodes in that country, use the "StrictExitNodes 1" command in torrc file after the ExitNodes command.
You should back up the original torrc file before making changes.
 - help w/ torrc commands.
Search the web or go to to get list of country codes.

Tor Vidalia bundle 0.2.1.30 - 0.2.12, Torbutton 1.33a in Vista x64 - GUI keeps locking up after Tor is active for a while (maybe 30 min - 1hr).  Happening several weeks - at least - most every time I use it longer than a few min.
After 1st starting Vidalia bundle, I can look at the Viadalia UI, Network status page (and logs) w/ no problems or delays.   Icons for both (if each has been opened once) are minimized to tray.  After a while, can no longer reopen / maximize either one - Vidalia or Network Status.  I can click the Vidalia icon group & it pops up both, but when click on them, nothing happens.  Also clicking "Restore" or "maximize" option either icon after clicking the group icon, does nothing.
Tor continues to work - unless I continue messing w/ the Vidalia UI, trying to get it opened.  Usually, after repeated attempts to get the UI opened, message pops that Vidalia has stopped working.  Then must close all 3 prgms thru task mgr.

I'll wholeheartedly agree w/ Andrew.  I'm not sure what the CCC is in Austria, but I would strongly suggest being VERY careful of what you say to the police w/o an attorney present.  I can't give legal advice, but I probably would NOT agree to questioning or interrogation by police without an attorney.
If the CCC Andrew mentioned is some group that provides free legal representation for certain cases, that's great.  In the US, some advocacy groups - particularly ones dealing w/ free speech / civil rights - might be interested in taking a case like this pro bono (for free) - or not.  That's assuming the person had been charged w/ a crime (or being investigated), or believed their civil rights had been violated.
Since YOU haven't been charged w/ anything - * yet * - it may be harder to find free legal help.  I would NOT let that stop me from speaking to an attorney before talking to the police, even if I had to pay a consultation fee.  I once got into a potential legal scrape, where I wasn't charged w/ anything, but it COULD have turned very nasty & costly, even though I would have eventually been cleared of wrong doing.  Hiring a (costly) attorney was a bitter pill to swallow, but fighting a case in court would have been much worse.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Don't use Google as default search in Tor Browser? 
Of course, you can always del the Google search plugin from TBB folder "Tor Browser\FirefoxPortable\App\Firefox\searchplugins."
When I type in search term in w/ Google selected as current search engine in TBB, ON THE * 1ST SEARCH ATTEMPT * w/ Google selected in search engine box, it pops up a msg saying, "Torbutton has detected a Google captcha.  Would you like to be redirected to another search engine for this query?" - as has been Tor behavior for long time.   There's also a box to make this action permanent.
*** BUT, on a 2nd SEARCH, w/ Google still selected as search engine, TBB does NOT show the screen, asking if you'd like to redirect to another search engine.  SEEMS like a BUG.  I tried various ways to get TBB to present the "do you want to redirect to another search engine" again, after the 1st search in a session, but couldn't get it to (if didn't check "make this permanent").  Not sure why developers leave Google search in, but the search plugins listed below are default ones in Firefox.
In my version of TBB, chooses to redirect from a Google captcha, automatically offers duckduckgo, when in about:config, because the DEFAULT setting for redirect engine to use is:  extensions.torbutton.google_redir_url * 5,* meaning the DEFAULT selection for redirection is # 5 url (duckduckgo, in my case), not url 1 (Ixquick).   Other than developers choice, no idea why # 5 url (duckduckgo) is selected by default.  The pop up screen to redirect should really give users options to choose from the several alternate search engines.  AFAIK, only way now is to alter about:config entry:  extensions.torbutton.google_redir_url  5 to a values corresponding to the search engine desired.
I'd rather they not make Google the default selected search engine.  Make Google searches an opt in vs opt out.
In TBB about: config,  browser.default.searchenginename is set = Google.  Not sure why.
Looking at included search plugins in TBB 2.2.34, search plugins included by default are Amazon, Ebay, Bing, Google, Wikipedia, Yahoo.  You can del them from the searchplugins folder, or just not use them.  Ixquick (which for a while was the one Tor redirected Google searches to) is another that doesn't log users' searches.  Ixquick, Scroogle, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia are all available in SSL / HTTPS plugins from Mozilla.

No, I didn't.  I told it * TO * redirect (which it did), I just didn't click the "make it permanent" box.  By my thinking, the only way that notice should NOT have appeared again, during same session, is if I DID check the "make it permanent" box.  Then it would automatically redirect each time.
I told it to redirect once, w/o checking the make it permanent box.  The next search thru Google, no pop up asking to redirect or not.

Thanks Tim - no, didn't see a captcha on 2nd, 3rd query.  Perhaps I don't understand some of Google's "process" when they get search requests coming from Tor network.  True, I don't know which exit node was in use on subsequent queries (I repeated this > once).
Each of several times I typed searches from Aurora search bar, w/ GOOGLE SELECTED as search engine (not from some site's search box), the 1st time it always presented a captcha.  I clicked "redirect" - but not the "make this permanent" box.
On subsequent searches in same session, w/ Google still selected as search engine, it never presented a captcha / "do you want to redirect" pop up.  Maybe ?? Aurora / TBB stores the choice from the 1st attempt & assumes you want to redirect each time, after clicking it once (but if so, be no need for the "make this permanent" box)?  Maybe a diff exit node was in use & Google security didn't trigger a captcha screen?

If you use Torbutton w/ regular Firefox, Torbutton has a setting which state it will start in - disabled or enabled.  You can change / save the preference.  I haven't used the latest stand alone Tor / Vidalia bundle w/ Firefox, so don't know what the default setting for Torbutton is.  It used to be set = disabled by default.
If you use TBB, Tor is automatically enabled when the Browser (Aurora (Firefox) ) is launched.

I have no concrete knowledge if it would violate any Mozilla agreements.
I was just thinking out loud. But (all Firefox / Aurora users) can make
other search engines the default just by moving another to the top of
the list via Manage Search Engines.
It's odd (to me) that the TBB developers take actions to avoid using
Google for searches, but leave Google search engine in Aurora at all,
unless there's good reason. Even if left out, users might add it back
(why, I don't know). If they did, that would still require the redirect
option to avoid Google. None of the developers have weighed in, so no
telling. Maybe they never thought about removing it? Developers?
Nothing's 100%, but detectives / investigative reporters often say,
"Follow the money," to get to the truth. Mozilla's very lucrative
involvement with Google is no secret. It wasn't widely publicized for a
good while. How or if that affects others modifying Firefox, no idea.
I'm not accusing anyone of anything, but one thought is, if Tor Project
isn't forbidden from taking Google search out & they're receiving no
revenue / consideration for leaving it in (even if they provide a way
around using Google), what's the point of leaving it in, when so many
other things that can compromise anonymity are excluded or disabled in
I would guess a fair # of less informed Tor / TBB users don't choose the
"redirect me" option on Tor's Google captcha pop up, or don't fully
understand why it appears. After all, they're used to seeing Google as
the search engine on virtually every Windows machine they've used.

Thanks Julian,
That may  be true.   Still leaves Advrk's question why Google search is left in Aurora.  My earlier posings are still unanswered (I certainly don't know the answers).
A lot of effort is put into helping Tor / TBB users avoid compromising anonymity by using Google searches.  Yet, the Google search engine is left in Aurora.  It's a pretty simple question - why?
No developers have commented - could be busy now.  They do often comment on issues that possibly don't have as much impact on anonymity as this If no one w/ * real * knowledge, comments on the reason(s) - (meaning, not just someone w/ a good theory) - then some would say, "you have your answer."

Christian, I'm not sure I understand your viewpoint, but... Assuming you mean (& / or for others' benefit), simply installing Tor or using Tor Browser gives complete anonymity, it in no way guarantees or even promises complete anonymity.  Tor Project is very clear about this.  Here's * one * page to start users to understand what's involved.  Maybe you already knew this.  But, no - there are many ways to * possibly * compromise anonymity while using Tor.  Google searches are ONLY one, because they record search terms & * any * possible info they can possibly squeeze out of your browser.  If Google searches, when using Tor, weren't ANY kind of anonymity threat, the developers wouldn't have gone to substantial trouble to offer users a way to avoid them, when encountered.
Google search engine records all search terms & ANY other possible info about your browser, etc., they can possibly squeeze out.  At the VERY least, some wouldn't want recorded their search terms & certainly not the pages they visit after the search, whether using Tor or not.  This is especially true if living in a repressive country.
Why can't Tor be a complete solution to all anonymity problems?  Because it's impossible for ANY one or entity to idiot proof anything, 100%.  No matter what you're dealing w/, or how safe it's been made, someone will always find a way to shoot themselves in the foot.

You are correct - not from Tor Project anyway.  They also don't say avoid robbing banks; don't stare at the sun, etc.  About all I can advise is, read Google's (lack of) privacy policy.  If you like it, use them.  If you'd rather not have your search terms recorded & also used for targeted advertising, then use another search engine that doesn't use those practices.  Your choice.  Aurora in it's default state doesn't prevent pop up advertising, in my experience.
Correct.  If you like Google's privacy policy & general business practices, use them.
You can use Google search if you want.  The captchas are presented by Google.  See this Tor FAQ   Tor provides a way around not having to enter the captcha (sometimes several times, if difficult to read), by offering a redirect.  In latest TBB 2.2.34, I don't know where alternate search engines for Google captchas are located in the bundle files.  I haven't yet been presented a Google captcha while using 2.2.34 - so don't know which default alternate search engine will be presented.  If you want to use Google when a captcha appears, don't click "redirect" & just enter the captcha.
FYI for others interested in changing the default alternate search engine on a google captcha redirect, in about:config, type 'redir' in search box.
The string:  extensions.torbutton.google_redir_url   will have a value like 5 (which is default for DuckDuckGo in mine).  Below this string are the other search engines w/ the numeric "url" values shown for each.  You can change the value from 5 (or what ever it shows) to a numeric value corresponding to other search engines.
Mine shows the value '1' for Ixquick, etc.:  extensions.torbutton.redir_url.1

@_subject: [tor-talk] Aurora tab loading status 
Since Firefox took any meaningful tab / page loading progress bar or indicator of any kind out, several versions ago, I rely on addons in Firefox to give some indication of how fast & how much is left to load.  If a page is slow / hung, I just cancel.  Can't tell that in stock Aurora.
Swirling dots don't tell anything.  Does anyone else use addon like Tab Mix Plus (that has tab loading progress options), or Status-4-Evar, etc?
There's so much about Firefox & thus Aurora, that is almost a necessity, IMO - esp. if using slower Tor network.  Not just tab progress bars.
On one hand, I don't want to load up Aurora w/ all kinds of addons that may interfere w/ Aurora's primary function.  On the other, unless just going to one or 2 sites & staying there, using stock Aurora is irritating at best, when comes to knowing how page loading is progressing.

I'm not sure I understand you - or vice versa.  I was speaking of a "monitor" for a * single page (tab) * being loaded, not total thru put.  AFAICT, the Vidalia bandwidth monitor would only be useful for my purpose, if the one page loading was the ONLY thing using bandwidth (will never be the case).  AFAIK, it also can't show a monitor in addon bar, menu bar, etc., to see individual page loading progress at a glance.
  I'm just looking for an indicator (green bar, numbers - what ever) that shows at least a relative speed, i.e., or the bar's even moving or not (if not actual values), and a rough % of how much is left to load.  So I know if the page is stalled, taking way longer than I'm willing to wait or almost thru loading.
Tab Mix Plus can show horiz. progress bars on each tab.  I've found they're pretty accurate & give a good idea if page is going to load or not.  I've not used the other progress bar addons from MAO, but some have several choices of type indicator you'd like to see.  If I remember, older Firefox versions had optional page loading status indicator - in lower L corner.  Opera had (has?) very similar, that showed speed & % transferred.

I upgraded to latest TBB 2.2.34-3 in Vista.  I usually copy my profile from previous version of TBB / Aurora into new version, so as not to have to redo some custom settings or reinstall a few extensions I have in TBB.
This time, after copying the profile from older TBB & replacing the default profile in 2.2.34-3 (in path E:\Temp\Tor Browser\TBB 2.2.34-3\Tor Browser\FirefoxPortable\Data\profile), none of the extensions show up as installed when launching TBB.

But the extensions that don't show as installed in latest TBB Addons Mgr - when it starts, ARE listed in the proper place in Explorer - as in the previous TBB version.

@_subject: [tor-talk] copying old profile to new Aurora not working 
1st, I guess some default settings in Aurora are actually stored in prefs.js (as in USER set prefs)?  If so, meaning the user prefs file isn't only user prefs - it has prefs set by Aurora devs?
Re:  shooting myself in the foot.  Maybe there's an issue w/ the prefs.js file - as mentioned - by copying the old prefs.js file into the new Aurora, which would be a valid concern.
There may be a good reason to extract newer versions the way you suggest because of prefs changes, but answering your question, most prefs I want to preserve are ones made by extensions.  I also don't use NoScript default settings, exactly as they come in Aurora.  There could be a white list of sites in NoScript, (for ex.), which might get wiped out if I just extract the new TBB over old one???  A few other similar situations.  This is an issue for me because stock Aurora doesn't block ads, or web trackers, block referrer headers or a # of other things.
I'm willing to try it your way, if it's not going to wipe out all extensions prefs / settings.   Ignoring the prefs issue you mentioned for the moment, I still don't see why copying the old profile into the new TBB profile folder shouldn't work (has in the past).  Again, maybe it's not a good idea because of what you mentioned.
I take it you're saying if users extract a new TBB into the earlier TBB version's folder, it WON'T wipe out extensions, their prefs, search plugins, etc., that you've already custom installed?  I think what it'll do is completely replace the previous prefs.js w/ all custom settings from extension.  If it overwrites any extensions' prefs, they'd have to be uninstalled / reinstalled.
But, as far as copying / restoring an older profile into a new Firefox (or just setting an older profile as default to use in new FF ver), that is an acceptable practice - even w/ Mozilla KBs how to do it (ignoring for the moment any issue w/ Aurora's prefs.js file).  It may be easier to allow a new ver to overwrite the old program files (assuming it doesn't mess them up as it sometimes does).
Since Aurora is just extracting vs installing, I didn't know how it would affect extensions, plugins (and user prefs) that were already installed in the previous TBB version.  An upgrade of Firefox automatically uses the old profile (even if installed to new folder), unless told otherwise.  It doesn't (normally) even touch the old profile.  In Firefox, it's easy just to tell it which profile (an older one) to use.  In Aurora, the profile is self contained w/ prgm files.

@_subject: [tor-talk] copying old profile to new Aurora not working 
I tried extracting the newer TBB 2.2.34-3 into the folder of the older version.  It didn't wipe out extensions completely, but as I expected, it over wrote all the extensions' preferences stored in prefs.js.  So, all would need setting their preferences again.  On some, this is a requirement - not personal choice.  You must set the prefs - often from a home page, before using the extensions.
Not sure what all prefs the TBB devs are putting in the prefs.js file, but I don't really want to reconfigure my / the extensions' prefs every few weeks, as Mozilla releases new versions, leading to new TBB versions.  I'm not sure why in NoScript, scripts are allowed globally by default or accept cookies for all sites would be enabled by default, but those & a few customizations in the browser are * some * other prefs I want to save.  Also don't want to look at ads / waste bandwidth w/ Tor or have trackers following me around, websites tracking me from one to another, which is why I install the extensions.   I guess TBB devs never expected anyone to use extensions other than the ones they install in It may be a standoff between needs of developers & a great deal of inconvenience, reconfiguring extensions after every TBB release. Seems maybe there needs to be another file to control the users' actual prefs & one for TBB devs' prefs to control Aurora to preserve anonymity / make it work correctly.
BTW, copying an old profile into new TBB profile folder does work, if you don't accidentally copy it to wrong folder.  That doesn't solve the issue Mike brought up earlier about developers changes being made in the prefs.js file.

@_subject: [tor-talk] observation:  Browser bundle & secure files deletion 
I've thought about TBB & it insecurely deleting files such as cache when closing TBB Firefox.  I assume this is what happens - I've investigated - a BIT - & seems that's what it does.  *Is this correct?*
If true, there's no opportunity to securely wipe the files, rather than them being insecurely deleted - unless I'm mistaken.  AFAIK, Tor has no secure wiping capability built in.
Don't remember reading in documentation, either that users should be  aware of this & take appropriate action, or that TBB already handles it securely.  Also, no mention of a list of files TBB deletes on shut down, that users might consider the possibility of data being recoverable.
If true, the only way to wipe any sensitive info (Ex.:  so a repressive gov't can't recover info from HDD), would be use a prgm to wipe free space on the partition containing TBB.  If it is installed on a flash drive, that could be wiped, but principal is still the same.
Since many users install most everything to C:\ - esp. in Windows  (in TBB case, unzip to a folder), then wiping free space process on the OS partition - which MAY be the whole HDD for some users, ALWAYS involves some risk to file(s) corruption.  I've never had a disaster wiping free space, but forums like Eraser, CCleaner & others are full of posts about the process (apparently) severely damaging the OS.
If my assumptions are correct,
1) Have TBB developers considered the issue of some deleted info from sessions, being recoverable?
2) Other than wiping free space, (which takes time) are there other suggestions for avg users to realistically deal w/ this?  It doesn't affect me so much, but in repressive countries, it may warrant I'd think for users wanting to securely wipe free space, it'd be best to use TBB on flash drive or a small partition on HDD.  It's possible ? w/ a proper list of files, the files in question MIGHT be securely deleted BEFORE closing TBB, but many wiping prgms would have problems wiping active files.

Thanks to both.
Advrk - Good point.  I'm no pure expert, but seems I've read if computer is POWERED off for ? several minutes, most RAM will be cleared.  Even if true, it's a bit inconvenient.  IMO, the RAM issue doesn't have as much widespread potential impact as things like cache & other files not being securely deleted.  ** I see that default Cache Space in Aurora is set = 0.  What about people w/ slower machines that REALLY need cache?  Of those needing it, I'd guess a good number * need * to securely delete it, whether they're aware or not.
Julian - TAILS handles what?  Clearing RAM or securely deleting files in FF containing personal data?  TAILS may be GREAT, but TBB users probably shouldn't have to rely on 3rd party apps to be secure (esp. in countries where using TBB, that the whole point of using it is (close to) complete anonymity & therefore security.  They probably shouldn't have to use a 3rd party wiping prgm.  Leaving files behind w/ incriminating info (from a repressive gov'ts view) isn't secure or anonymous.
Regarding deciding on your threat model - one of my points is, even many Tor / TBB users don't KNOW anything about secure / insecure deletion of certain files when TBB is closed.
This could also involve Vidalia / Tor files in TBB.  Some don't know what a threat model is.  If we're assuming only advanced users should be using Tor / TBB, then everything's fine.  I'm almost positive that's NOT the developers' assumption / position.
I haven't investigated far enough yet to know what TBB / Aurora will do if under Options > Privacy, you check the box:  "Clear history when Aurora closes," then UNcheck most of the items under the settings.  Then after closing TBB, use a wiping prgm w/ pre configured task to wipe the files / folders you want.  Again, avg users would have to be instructed -  in plain language - not computer speak.  A lot of users would *  need help * knowing which files to delete that might contain personal / private data.
Perhaps a list of all files potentially containing personal / private / browsing data could be listed - VERY PROMINENTLY - where all users would see it & some instructions on how to securely delete them.  Firefox no longer shows the "Delete Private Data" box at shutdown, but an addon "Ask For Sanitize" brings back that box, so one can see / change what's being (insecurely) deleted at shutdown.  Or choose not to delete anything, then use a wiping prgm to del files.

@_subject: [tor-talk] observation: Browser bundle & secure files deletion 
Robert, your points are well taken [repeatedly :) ].  You overlooked some possibilities or I wasn't clear.
  *One * example:  Using TBB, if no sites one wants to visit require cookies to operate correctly - or at all, that's fine.  But lots of sites won't work correctly w/o cookies.  The assumption is perhaps cookies from sites that might get someone in trouble, but is just as important to some users simply for privacy / anonymity.  If cookies must be allowed - even if only for a site - w/ default settings of "NOT to clear history when Aurora closes," in Aurora, then deleting those cookies - either thru Aurora "delete history" settings / UI or manually deleting the cookies file in the profile, won't securely delete them.
You're assuming users will never have to change (any) default setting in TBB to make sites  *work.*  If that were true, things would be much simpler.  I agree, using default settings is best, if possible.  Another assumption seems that all machines have enough RAM & CPU speed / power, to navigate / access some sites using Tor / TBB, and it not be excruciatingly slow (or impossible), w/o using cache.  Not everyone in the U.S., much less Iraq / Iran can afford a newer, faster machine.  It would be better if TBB users don't allow caching.  For older, slower machines, streaming political videos would be difficult w/o caching.  If they just "clear cache," it will be insecurely deleted.  Maybe they could d/l the file, but if they want to securely del it after (that doesn't concern TBB, per se), they need to use secure wiping.
I'm assuming the comment about infeasibility of securely erasing files on modern OSs, is based partly on 1) TBB being on same partition as the OS; 2) volume shadow service (Win) or similar is in use on the partition where TBB is running or files being stored (if any are).  Many users have only 1 partition - many don't.
I haven't read that that securely wiping * files or free space * on ANY partitions (meaning, none) can ever be effective, IF simple precautions are taken & simple instructions are followed  (esp. ones not involving the OS partition).  If you know of credible documentation that under NO circumstances, can data be securely & permanently deleted from any location on machines, I truly want to read it, because it will change some of my practices.  Like for certain financial files, medical records, letters to doctors, etc.
I think ? what you mentioned is one reason not to install TBB (or any other apps or store files) on OS partition, if want to securely & permanently del info.  Another option is to run apps in sandboxed environment.  That's why I don't store my vanilla Firefox profiles on C:\ w/ Windows.  Otherwise, if VSS is enabled, private data gets stored in it.

Fabio, I understand your idea is well intentioned & perhaps has some merit.  But, when it comes to anonymity & security (especially if live in a country where finding out you accessed banned sites -or used banned Tor software could get you jailed or worse), if a user is "too dumb" to read at least SOME instructions or have minimal computer skills & a tiny bit of common sense, I think it may be hopeless.  If they were  really as dumb as you say (some) may be, they'll likely find a way to compromise their anonymity, no matter how simple it is to install TBB.
Not that it couldn't be offered as an option [but that would hopelessly confuse the really "dumb" ones :) ], but software needs to offer option to install to locations of users' choice.

Follow that link - for Windows - & it says: /Version 2.2.33-3/.  So, what is the latest TBB version?
My apologies, but I've thought for a while that news about new releases for many Tor Project apps was a bit disorganized.  I see diff things about releases, in diff places on the Tor site.
This isn't a big deal - I just think it could be better organized.  At times, sort of appears the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing.  I understand developers are in a rush, but Tor is confusing enough for less savvy users w/o posting conflicting info.  I don't consider myself (severely) "less savvy," but I know how they feel.

I believe others said it's fixed now (thanks) - but w/ the orig details of problem, there shouldn't be any need  to install a new ver & immediately RESTART it to stop false warnings.  That makes no sense.  It wasn't just that it DID a ver check on 1st start, but said a new ver was avail, when it wasn't.

Using addons, plugins, etc. of ALL sorts is a touchy subject regarding Tor & anonymity.  I'm wondering about use of Firefox themes & addons like Tab Mix Plus?  Any thoughts on the topic?
I give the native theme in Aurora / Firefox (7) low marks for usability, including overall tabs functions / features - (nothing to do w/ Tor developers).  It's difficult going back & forth from Aurora to Firefox once I am used to a theme in vanilla FF providing better usability & visibility - esp. if you don't have 25 yr old eyes.
AFAIK, themes & addons that simply change the GUI & don't send / receive any info or contact sites, aren't a threat to Tor's anonymity?  Tor controls to allow / don't allow updates, anyway.
So, I'm guessing themes / addons that don't "phone home" aren't a problem w/ Tor, but need to verify this.  Thanks.

No, I didn't make it clear.  I was asking which FILE that TBB used, to cue off of to check for NEW versions (as SOON as TBB starts), & I'm assuming (but, in this case, maybe just a bug) - then checks a site - which I guess you listed above.  Maybe some setting got set to "Latest Ver? = No", and is stuck.
Yes, it's a fresh d/l - don't know how many times I have to d/l & do the same thing, the same way & expect diff results, before I'm pronounced insane. :)
When TBB starts, goes to Tor check site, it also has notice on same startup page that an update is avail.  Maybe it actually checked, or that's just a msg that "got stuck."  No matter how many times (so far) TBB is restarted, it still gives same msg about update avail.
BUT..... if I manually check for updates, it says TBB is UP TO DATE.  So there's something wrong in a file, or the auto version checking / startup process, etc.

What type of info & by what mechanism would you be looking for, that's sent to MAO site?
There was long discussion in the recent past about updating addons / FF in a Tor or TBB session.  FWIW, looks like the DEFAULT setting in Aurora (TBB 2.2.33-3) under Options>Network>Update, is to automatically check for addons updates (by design or mistake), but NOT to check Firefox updates.  Now, whether NoScript in later TBB versions over rides all that, don't know.  Either way, checking for themes & addons updates is same Mozilla site.
I don't think info sent to MAO site for themes would be diff than other addons.  Except for a very few addons that take you to external pages, once addon is installed / updated.  But, "auto check for addons" can be manually DESELECTED, once an addon / theme is installed.

Yes, you sent this while I was typing reply to Andrew.  See that post.
I restarted it - several times&  cold booted machine.  With a 2nd fresh d/l of 2.2.33-3.  The STARTUP / tor check screen has - EVERY time, in big orange letters,
"There is an update available for the Tor Browser Bundle"  It's obviously a false report, because there isn't a new version.

There's the problem.  The line in about:config is:  torbrowser.version;  user set  2.2.32-4-Windows-
Also, in prefs.js, has this line:
"user_pref("torbrowser.version", "2.2.32-4-Windows-");"
Only thing is, "user" didn't set it.  What I discovered from extracting another fresh 2.2.33-3 to a diff folder, is it is already a pre configured "user pref" that names the version.  If it's pre configured, it's not a user set pref.  And what does the browser ver # have to do w/ a * user * pref?
Should it be called a default string value, rather than a user pref ?  Maybe there was a reason, but I don't see why it couldn't / shouldn't be a default value in about:config.  After all, there's not really an "upgrade" mechanism - you just d/l the new TBB & extract into a folder.
The problem w/ the startup page showing there was a new version, was I copied my old profile (say from 2.2.32-4) into the latest TBB ver profile folder.  Something perfectly normal & acceptable in Firefox.  Why would I want to reconfig the Aurora UI ( things like not show suggestions when typing in address bar, font size, etc.), or reinstall & reconfigure the few extensions used in TBB - every time a new version comes out?
Because TBB calls the string for "torbrowser.version" a USER pref, it got stored in my BU profile from earlier version & copied into latest TBB.
When I * manually " check for updates thru options / help, it does NOT notify of a later avail ver.  So, process of * manually * checking updates must be different than one used at startup.  Or maybe they're checking 2 diff things?
Unless for each new TBB ver, where I want to use my * existing * profile,  I manually edit the torbrowser.version string to match latest ver just installed, I'd always get the erroneous startup screen msg.  Doesn't seem like it's set up for users to use their last profile (even from one minor ver ago).
If this is something that can be altered & you'd like me to file a ticket, let me know.

Thanks.  Good to know there's a bug already filed on my problem.  Anyway, changing the torbrowser.version value to correct new version, temporarily fixed the new version notification.
For tonight, I'll only answer this one of your stmts.  You were probably thinking only of users w/ a single profile & probably in the default location & install in the same folder as previous ver.  I have / do none of those.
When installing a new Firefox version, if you have multiple profiles & want to use a specific one, you often must either specify thru profile mgr which to use, copy (or restore from a BU) a profile over to the new install or copy / restore selected files the user chooses.  In the latter case, there's no choice except copying / restoring.
Firefox doesn't copy any files - it just uses the last active profile, AFAIK.  One reason to BU / restore the old profile, is if updating, some files in the existing profile can get corrupted.  I've had it happen a few times & thousands on Mozillazine forums have.  In the case of TBB, UNLESS you're extracting over the top of the existing version (I don't), I don't see how it will pick up the previous profile.  I haven't tried it w/ TBB - not sure what it'd do.
Maybe TBB is configured that way, but you're not "installing" anything - just extracting files.  TBB comes w/ a pre configured prefs.js file - as I discovered.  Which prefs.js would win, if extracted a new ver to the old folder?  I imagine for duplicate files, 7Zip would ask to confirm which file to keep.

If you're thinking the police might break down your door, I'd either stop doing anything remotely illegal where you are, or invest in REALLY strong, steel doors, & look into prgms specifically designed to overwrite / clear RAM.

The security issue about themes & TBB would be (some ?) themes altering some function(s) of Aurora that would interfere w/ normal Tor / Aurora settings or functions, compromising anonymity.  I doubt that is the case, but have nothing to prove it.

Thanks for all replies on this.  I read over several linked articles.  Honestly, many avg users won't / can't take time to read it all & may not understand it.
Question - obviously, Tor isn't the only software or site that could be targeted.  What's to prevent necessity of verifying signatures on every d/l software, even mainstream, major developers (if they made it possible)?  And if they don't, why wouldn't users of other software be at same risk?  Just because we haven't heard about XYZ software & fake certificates, does that mean anything?  Sure, verifying Tor may be prudent, but what if users have to verify signatures on all software (if available)?  Unless it becomes a more automated process, avg users wouldn't devote that kind of time.
I'm just asking here - other than entities (gov'ts?) targeting anonymity software (for now) what prevents this issue from becoming widespread?  If I download an update from MS - how do I know it's the authentic pkg from the real MS?  There's no authentication (or even check sums) for d/l Firefox, IE.  Only a small % of all developers offer these capabilities.

Thanks Netizio & others.  Clarification - check sums & verifying signatures are completely different animals - yes?  I'm getting more educated on signature verification, but more questions are popping up as well.  Netizio, when you're right, you're right.  I had never seen the page for mozilla w/ a "key", MD5s, SHA1s.  You don't see it on their main d/l page - least I never have.
I'm asking these questions, because others that don't know are afraid to raise their hands.  What you don't know CAN hurt you.  I haven't used signature verification before, but my education field is about as technical as it gets.  My 1st impression w/ the process (& instructions on Tor page - verifying signatures) is, it will be over the avg users' heads, or more trouble / effort than they're willing to exert (possibly to their detriment).  I haven't tried the steps listed on Tor site, but seems pretty straight forward.
Q-1:  on the Mozilla link above, the "Key" says
Obviously, they assume anyone looking at that page & info will know exactly what to do w/ it.   I don't.  Would the process of using the data on their "Key" page be same as described on Tor Project's "Verifying Signatures" page?
Jeroen, thanks for links, but I was talking about more automated signature verification.  I think those were more for check sums - yes?  Still, good info.
No.  I understand Tor Project's main concern is Tor / TBB.  I fail to understand why the issue / problem being discussed is in any way limited to Tor or a few softwares.  It seems like if it is, or could be a serious concern for Tor users, it could be for users of any software.  My contention was, few are going to go to the trouble to verify signatures, by the  process that currently exists  (if signatures for everything existed - & it appears they SHOULD - but don't).
So, either it's a major concern & a LOT of people are going to get "infected" because they can't follow the procedures to verify signatures , or they won't take the time; OR it's not that big a risk for avg users.

Lee, you bring up an interesting point about certificate warnings & ignoring them.
Sometimes I get from Firefox 5, 6 - the warnings, "We can't verify the authenticity of the certificate."  It may give a reason - like it's expired.  Quite often these are bank / investment / insurance sites.
Sometimes, the warning comes from Kaspersky IS.  Either way, it sometimes turns out - if I call CS, they "are aware of the problem" - like expired certificate.  I guess they don't really keep up w/ it.
But, it could just as easily be someone faking it.  AFAIK, an avg user has no way to tell if it's a fake or if a site let certificate expire, except call CS.  My guess is most "avg" users think, "I know I typed the correct address, & it says "HTTPS" at the top, so I'm safe."  Wrong.   From the very beginning of HTTPS & certificates, I wondered what will prevent people from eventually faking some part or another of the "system."  I guess it's statistically safer than plain HTTP, but not foolproof by any stretch.  Yet, sites promote it as being totally safe.  I can't even convince several financial sites to allow more than 10 PW chars, & to allow special characters.
It doesn't happen every wk, but often enough to be a PITA.  It also seems to happen when I really need to transact business - Murphy's law.
For these warnings (esp. about expired certs) - I don't know if there's a way for users to verify / resolve questions, except talking to IT dept of the company - if avail.

Respectfully, I think some may have missed the point of (part of) my earlier comments & Julian's about PWs.  Admittedly, we got off topic.  It has nothing to do w/ Tor or fake certificates.
So, for me, feel free to drop the topic about lack of PW security.  But, the WHOLE point of my comments was (certificates, PWs, whatever), corporations say they are using highly secure methods & technology online, when in fact they often aren't.  And yes, I have complained & gotten the canned replies, "we take customers' security & online safety very seriously & use high security standards..."
My point was (& I think Julian's) was, aside from certificate issues, various practices of many sites where security is vitally important, their WORDS "~ we take customers' security & online safety very seriously & use high security standards...," and their ACTIONS don't match.  It's not a matter of if one * could * "cover their screen" when typing an exposed PW, it's that it's generally a bad idea, that could be easily corrected.  Limiting PWs to 10 alpha numeric chars (w/ NO spec. chars) is a bad idea & AFAIK, there's no reason a multi bill. corp. like Vanguard invstmts couldn't allow more chars & special chars.
I also asked a question about options for users, when they are confronted w/ a warning that the site's certificate authenticity can't be verified?  If it's your bank & you need to transact business - THAT day - what can you do except call & * maybe * talk to IT?  If they can confirm they're aware of problem, one could probably feel safe in accessing the site anyway.  What if you can't reach IT?

Hi, I don't believe so.  I asked the same thing a few wks ago, because of running other apps thru Tor, when didn't necessarily want / need TBB open.  Or, if TBB hangs / crashes, & don't want to lose Tor connection on the other app(s).
Answer I was given - Tor/ Vidalia & TBB can be installed on same machine, because TBB runs out of it's own folder (or off a USB drive) & uses separate Firefox profile.  Running both at SAME time could be a problem (don't remember that part of answer), but haven't tried it out yet.
I've slept since then, & forgot exactly what one of the gurus said - ** if TBB & Tor - Vidalia bundle could be RUN at same time (perhaps w/ some mods)? **  I'd appreciate a refresher on that.:)

@_subject: [tor-talk] question about socks 4, 5 
was playing w/ latest TBB & seeing how other apps (like email - Tbird, or other apps) behaved, just to experiment.
1) Question about changes in proxy settings of late(er) TBB (Aurora - FF 6) use.  Notice that ONLY things filled in on network > settings page is:
- Manual Proxy Config is checked,
- under SOCKS host, 127.0.0.1 is used, and PORT 9050 used.
- SOCKS 5 is checked.
Obviously, changes from past Tor.  I saw msgs in TBB / Vidalia log (which unfortunately, I didn't figure out how to save - it's gone once TBB shuts down), to effect of (pardon my poor memory): "An (or some) applic. is trying to do.... on SOCKS 5... which ~ may compromise anonymity... "Consider using SOCKS 4 instead, ... or use Polipo (Privoxy?)"
Question isn't about ONE app, but in general.  If trying to torrify other apps, how do you know (now) WHICH settings to use in connection settings for that app(s)?
HTTP, SSL, SOCKS 4 / 5?  Or some combo of one or more of these settings & which Proxy or Port for each?
By that, mean by CURRENT ways that Tor / TBB work, not outdated help / FAQ articles (sorry).  Some help files & articles are out of date & no longer apply for some settings.
Could be wrong, but don't think instructions on   have changed in * long * time.

I'm sorry, but don't really follow all the article & don't know when it was updated - no date!!!
Haven't gotten around to trying to install both latest TBB AND Tor bundle or run * at same time, * on diff ports - but need to.  Life doesn't stop because TBB is open.

@_subject: [tor-talk] question about socks 4, 5 
Thanks for detailed reply.  It answered some questions, but I think for most users (perhaps technical, but not *extremely* advanced), it raises just as many more.  I'm glad I don't live in Pakistan.
1)  Most apps I've looked at w/ ability to select connection mode don't specify SOCKS 4 / 4a, or 5 / "5 w/ hostnames."  MAYBE info could be found from developer or forums.  Like you said,
"For example Privoxy only supports the "SOCKS5 with hostnames" flavour but simply refers to it as SOCKS5"
Even Tbird 6 doesn't specify anything except simply SOCKS 4 / 5.
2)  If using Tor / Vidalia / Polipo bundle, & it's enabled, AND applications are config'd to use the port that Polipo uses, aren't the applications using the correct SOCKS type & port  to prevent DNS leaks, or do many apps just ignore the Polipo settings?
I suppose ? if apps don't support SOCKS 4a / 5 w/ hostnames, they'll just do what ever they're able & doesn't really matter if using Polipo & app is config'd to use same proxy / port?
Info on this general issue is scattered out like debris field of a crashing space shuttle.  It appears that "torrifying non browser apps" isn't a big concern for Tor developers, because instructions to do so & how (or even if) can be verified are far beyond avg users' ability.  Not a criticism - just observation.  The FAQ quoted below illustrates the point - not enough details for most users & incomplete.  * Most Tor users are probably somewhat above avg, anyway, but do we really think the instructions below are sufficient for avg Tor users? *
 From the FAQ:  "I keep seeing these warnings about SOCKS and DNS and information leaks. Should I worry?"*
[IMHO, these instructions fall into the category, "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing."  Besides, no where near complete enough for avg - sl. above avg users to torrify apps safely]
"Where SOCKS comes in.* Your application uses the SOCKS protocol to connect to your local Tor client. There are 3 versions of SOCKS you are likely to run into: SOCKS 4 (which only uses IP addresses), SOCKS 5 (which usually uses IP addresses in practice), and SOCKS 4a (which uses When your application uses SOCKS 4 or SOCKS 5 to give Tor an IP address, Tor guesses that it 'probably' got the IP address non-anonymously from a DNS server. That's why it gives you a warning message: you probably aren't as anonymous as you think.
*So what can I do?* We describe a few solutions below.
  * If your application speaks SOCKS 4a, use it. [caveat:  most apps
    don't say 4 / 4a, etc.]
  * For HTTP (web browsing), either configure your browser to perform
    remote DNS lookups (see the Torify HOWTO
     how
    to do this for some versions of Firefox) ** or use a socks4a-capable
    HTTP proxy, such as Polipo.** [again, from your comment & what I
    gather, using this may mean nothing] See the Tor documentation for
    more information. For instant messaging or IRC, use Gaim or XChat.
    For other programs, consider using freecap (on Win32) or dsocks (on
    BSD).
  * If you only need one or two hosts, or you are good at programming,
    you may be able to get a socks-based port-forwarder like socatg to
    work for you; see the Torify HOWTO
     for
    examples.
  * Tor ships with a program called tor-resolveg that can use the Tor
    network to look up hostnames remotely; if you resolve hostnames to
    IPs with tor-resolve, then pass the IPs to your applications, you'll
    be fine. (Tor will still give the warning, but now you know what it
    means.) [and instructions for config'g apps to use tor-resolve are
    where?]
  * You can use TorDNS as a local DNS server to rectify the DNS leakage.
    See the Torify HOWTO
     for
    info on how to run particular applications anonymously.
If you think that you applied one of the solutions properly but still experience DNS leaks please verify there is no third-party application using DNS independently of Tor. Please see the FAQ entry on whether you're really absolutely anonymous using Tor for some examples.
      How do I check if my application
      that uses SOCKS is leaking DNS requests?
These are two steps you need to take here. The first is to make sure that it's using the correct variant of the SOCKS protocol, and the second is to make sure that there aren't other leaks.
Step one: add "TestgSocks 1" to your torrc  file, and then watch your logs as you use your application. Tor will then log, for each SOCKS connection, whether it was using a 'good' variant or a 'bad' one. (If you want to automatically disable all 'bad' variants, set "SafeSocks 1" in your torrc file.)
Step two: even if your application is using the correct variant of the SOCKS protocol, there is still a risk that it could be leaking DNS queries. This problem happens most commonly in Firefox extensions that resolve the destination hostname themselves?, for example to show you its IP address, what country it's in, etc. These applications may use a safe SOCKS variant when actually making connections, but they still do DNS resolves locally. If you suspect your application might behave like this, you should use a network sniffer like Wireshark and look for suspicious outbound DNS requests. I'm afraid the details of how to look for these problems are beyond the scope of a FAQ entry though * [& those details are where?] * -- * find a friend to help * if you have problems

I don't use Hotmail, but it may / may not be related to javascript.  Either way, make sure that (at least) session cookies are allowed to be set for HM.
For grins, after disabling NOScript, look in about:config, type "javascript" in search, & see if any are still set to deny javascript, even though may have disabled / uninstalled an addon.  Uninstalling them (assume disabling, too) does NOT always reset the preferences they changed back to default.  It should, but doesn't always.
Are you using the same install & same profile of FF w/ Tor, as used for everyday use w/o Tor?  Or is it a separate FF / profile, w/ diff addons or plugins, that you're running w/ Tor?
Look at the error console to see what, if any, errors show when trying to load the pages that show basically blank.  AFAIK, if FF has problems w/ a page, it will log errors in error console.
If given option, try changing the viewing mode of msgs to text only.
Either way, try starting FF in safe mode to disable all addons / plugins, then start Tor & check.
Since you CAN login, it's not a problem of using exit nodes in a diff country than when HM acct was setup, which some email providers don't like.

William, as suggested, not sure if js purely by itself is the problem.  What's IN the error / warnings is important.  I do NOT claim to be an expert on the warning msgs in FF error console.  By any chance, have you tried the latest Tor browser bundle, to see if this problem is related something like Torbutton or some thing to do w/ Tor pkg vs TBB?  You don't have to install TBB -unzip to folder or USB drive, etc.  Just (for now) don't run TBB & Tor pkg at same time.  See if TBB allows viewing the email msgs.
You didn't say if started FF in safe mode (disable all addons / plugins), then started Tor?  Maybe not here, but addons can cause lots of problems.
It's been a while since I played w/ settings in Torbutton, but many have run into pages occasionally that don't work w/ Tor.  Sometimes error is discovered - sometimes not.

I'm curious (& forgive my ignorance), but what kind / situation of whistle blower do you mean that would use this application?
One kind of whistle blower would HAVE  to make their identity known (like some corporate settings), unless they were reporting it to entities outside the corp (media).
If reporting to outside entities, can't you just write an anonymous letter?  If really paranoid, wear gloves while doing it.
And perhaps it's to report some gov't misconduct.  If reporting TO a gov't, write letter, wad paper, throw in trash & save a stamp.  If reporting to some media they probably don't care if it's this type communication, anonymous email or anonymous letter / phone call.

Do you have any other addons installed (like Fasterfox) or something that might be over riding the changed settings?
After you make the changes in about:config, close the window then close FF.  Open the file prefs.js in the main profile folder, where you extracted the TBB files (it the Profile under "Firefox Portable\....).
Search for the strings you changed & see if they exist.
The only other thing I can think of is TBB devs put instructions somewhere else to set the options you mention to the values you see, each time it starts.
Memory cache is ENABLED by default in my latest ver of TBB.
I can see browser.cache.disk.enable being False (not writing anything to disk, for privacy), but I don't see why using memory cache is a threat & not sure you should disable it.  Maybe someone else can answer that.

Juan / Jed, I tried running Tor through several well known web proxies.  Even though proxies had options to allow / disable scripts," when I allowed scripts, GMX still showed message, "Please enable JS & try again."  NOTE:  I've used Tor / TBB & some of same proxies directly w/ Firefox, & never gotten a "Please enable javascript" message from any site, AFAIK.
Tried a few proxies - some SSL, some not.  Some proxies showed (or allowed choosing) a U.S. location, so that wasn't the issue.  Tor is also using US exits.
Also entered GMX.com & the proxy's domain on NoScript white list.  No change after reloading GMX / proxy page in TBB.  GMX still gave "enable Then as test, tried just Firefox 14 thru the proxies, that HAD options to enable JS (I did).  Same result - GMX still thinks JS is disabled.

Gotten several suggestions - thanks for all.  Point:  Being ABLE to sign up w/ an email provider via Tor * & * that provider being trustworthy (not selling your address, scanning contents to sell for advertising [if don't encrypt messages] are 2 entirely different things.  Like doctor, mechanic recommendations, I always prefer them from actual clients / users (preferably > 1) that have used them > 1x & been satisfied.
Jed:  ** "What am I looking for?" **  Mostly anonymity & untraceability - for all * practical * purposes. Not to evade LEAs. But... if need to send whistle blower type email - or - some (polite) ones to neighbor w/ car up on blocks, I want NO way they can trace it, short of LEA becoming involved.  Though sending truthful whistle blower messages isn't unlawful, people w/ power have powerful connections.  Both examples are real scenarios for me.
If those requirements help anyone w/ suggestions of providers they've personally used - or read enough unbiased, technical reviews to be reasonably sure a provider has a very good reputation, that's better than, "I've heard of these - give them a look."
GMX may not be even close to a good choice for these purposes. However, was NEVER able to get past them claiming JS was off, using Tor, Tor & a proxy, just a proxy - even though proxies had option to allow JS - & even if whitelisted their site in NoScript.  However, some of other suggested providers may be better choices, assuming they're not spammers in sheep's clothing.
Thanks Praedor, adrelnos, antispam06 - for other email provider names.  Will check out.  Heard of safe-mail a long time - don't know anyone personally that's used it.

I'm no expert, but seems this would require Tor becoming a P2P network, which requires in some manner, transmitting IP addresses to each other.  However, Tor IP addresses aren't exclusive to any one user at any given time.   Your idea is that Tor network would cloak the true identity of one user from another?
Since Tor users often have enough trouble accessing some sites now, how would using others addresses provide any more success or anonymity?  Besides, now one can get a new IP address w/ a click, or specify exit nodes in specific countries.  As I see it, the problem is some sites don't like TOR EXITS, which they can identify & that multiple users are coming from the same address.

If you mean, a chance that your REAL ISP - assigned address; assigned to your router / acct, when you're computer is connected to your ISP's network - then answer is no.
Your real ISP would never be assigned by a Tor node (server) because they use ranges of IP addresses of their own.

Thanks.  Riseup says they don't store IP addresses or log emails. If (for a company in U.S.) the gov't will even ALLOW that, then that's good - as almost all provider say they log to some extent. BUT... considering ISPs, wireless providers, Skype - on & on - are being "forced" into either keeping records, that can be demanded w/ very little reason from an LEA, or are being strong armed into providing backdoors, I at least * question * whether one mail provider (onshore, in U.S.) can resist the long arm of the law.
I may be wrong.  But, as most know, just because a company makes claims, doesn't mean they're true.
2nd, I can't find anywhere - w/o signing up - what Riseup's general "starting" storage quota or max message and / or attachment size limits are, even using search engines.
I understand IF they don't make $ off advertising, they need it from other sources (donations).  But, their suggested "individual" donation of $5 - 15 / mo & for businesses, 1% of annual budget (Ex.:  $100 for $10K budget) seems lopsided.  A business / organization will generate way more traffic than (especially) me. But, I don't know what I'd get for $5 / mo, even if I liked them, unless I sign up or another user tells me.
Re:  GMX & Tor address problem.  GMX responded to request I sent about not being able to sign up w/ Tor - at my organization (wink). They request on their site to include the IP you're having problems registering with, so I gave the (current) Tor IP.  They said,

(not sure exactly what he meant)  What would that accomplish, for anonymity?  If you didn't create the acct w/ Tor (or proxy), they know the real IP address of the owner.  Thanks.

Thanks Douglas, very helpful.  The approx. 92 MB storage isn't much problem.  Yes, 2 MB is tiny.  I suppose IF they really don't log IPs or data, that's what you're paying for (if that's important), rather than free providers that gather data & sell it.  I just have a health suspicion of a TINY % of companies in *any* industry that say, "/we're different than all the rest/."  Riseup may be, but usually in sum total, most companies in an industry are similar. One will cut a little here, but add it back somewhere else.
If the U.S. gov't allowed them not to keep ANY records, _every terrorist_ in this country & many others would be flocking to Riseup.  Or maybe that's the plan.  Since it's unlikely they'll allow that... anymore than they'd allow 1 or 2 phone Co's. NOT to keep records or build phone systems that couldn't be wire tapped.
BTW, did send Riseup support a question about their limits.

Thanks for all replies.  I'm responding to antispam06's reply, only because it was last of several.  Because the issue is more complex than I thought, GMX is no longer the sole focus.  Overall, the info should benefit *lots* of users, IMHO.
Absolutely - never said or hinted Tor was only network or service being abused.  But I'm talking about using Tor to sign up for email.
GMX probably blacklisted (many?) Tor IP addresses simply because several users tried signing up w/ same IP over time.  I tried several - hrs / days apart, after clearing everything in latest TBB, AFAIK; getting new identity / IP address.  RE-jected!
Good to know, but how?  How'd you create Gmail acct w/ Tor & not give mobile   How did you get GMX to accept a Tor address (got lucky?).  I'm not arguing. Obviously, I'm not as experienced / crafty / lucky as some, so looking for HOW folks *recently* created email accts w/ various providers, using Tor - or other "anonymous" ways.  I haven't tried - every - provider w/ Tor & would prefer not to spend days.  I've learned a lot from responses (as will others, not so experienced using Tor for How long ago did you (or others) create them; have providers since changed methods;  how long / how much effort did it take; what techniques were used?  Did some just get lucky on a couple of tries w/ NON blacklisted Tor IPs, or did it take days & dozens of Tor addresses, using all techniques you mentioned?
I suppose WiFi is a possibility, but I don't frequent WiFi spots. Correct me if wrong, but if logging on in the "clear" *vs* using Tor, they can get more info about your machine, that can possibly identify it You mention using ANOTHER machine & so did GMX "support," after they replied, that (one) Tor address I used was blacklisted.
Does that - possibly - mean that for any user in this scenario, even using *Tor* for registering (& failing 1st few attempts), a provider collected enough info to ID my PC again, even if use another address (Tor or not)?  This topic is no longer JUST about GMX.
Using others computers to create an acct that might be used for whistle blowing (w/o Tor or proxy - or what DID you mean?) ... not sure about that one.
I understand most providers will (certainly can) scan unencrypted email.  But, if sending whistle blower or msgs to neighbors w/ junk cars, won't be sending encrypted ones.
I just don't want them to trace me.  Not trying to outwit LEA here, even though it'd be nice not to have mail scanned.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Creating email accounts via Tor was: Re: anyone created 
Haha???  :(
It sounds like you did get "lucky" if the 1st exit IPs used worked the 1st time on most accounts you set up.
EITHER - in GMX case, I happened to randomly get multiple IP addresses, over hrs & days, ALL blacklisted by GMX (& you *didn't*), or GMX has a way to tell it's the same computer using a diff Tor address.  It's one or the other, or both.  Somehow, I doubt that they have that ability - not sure.
At this point, GMX is only an example.  I won't be using this acct often.  Other than some other providers have much shorter acct deactivation period if no login, which I WILL forget & then have to create another "anonymous" acct.  I don't blow whistles everyday & *definitely* won't be storing those emails on server.
They said "another computer."  Why they said it, or exactly what they meant, don't know.  I replied & asked to clarify.
By "going _through_ another place," you mean like WiFi w/o Tor, or somewhere that they (email provider) can't link to ME (real ISP) & I also don't have to use Tor to register?
You said, "_How about going through another computer._"
I meant, I question the wisdom, using another person's computer (_w/o Tor or *some* anonymizing means_) to create email acct to be used for whistle blowing.  Don't want anything coming back on friends / family.
And if you meant, use another computer AND Tor, don't see the point.  My computer isn't the problem (unless sites like GMX, others can ID it), even after clearing & closing TBB & getting new address.  Maybe I should check for super cookies. :D
Yes, Gmail does actively *scan* email, to deliver targeted ads. Says exactly that in TOS and / or PP (least, it did short time ago).  Probably others as well, if read their docs carefully.

It'd be hard to avg user to create anonymous Gmail acct.  Maybe use a throw away cell phone; use WiFi that's near pay phone?  Google SAYS they won't do anything w/ the phone # or SMS device, except to verify the acct.  But then, Google says a lot of things.  It only deters "honest" people from setting up anonymous accts - criminal types will use throw away phones, etc.
In my search for providers to create accts using Tor, Safe-mail was one.  Yes - based in Israel.  Don't know it's a big concern, except some servers might filter email from foreign countries - but many don't.  They have long, 6 mo period before inactivating accts w/o login; Storage of 3 MB is very low.  Send a msg, then del, I guess.
Privatdemail.net is in Egypt & don't allow sending email to Israel.  SAY they don't log *any* files or IP addresses.  Have decent 500 MB storage; 10 MB max message size; support POP / IMAP; 90 day deactivation if no login.  No idea how many servers would filter mail from Egypt.

That's a very interesting question / comment.  Also points out, Tor users from many countries are reading the U.S. list.  I've no idea of google policies / practices (or any other providers') for different countries.  It's hard enough to pin point what they are in US, as different US users report different Google / Gmail experiences.  Google may "switch it up" to keep potential spammers off balance.  Or, due to differences in users' browser / OS / FW / privacy software, etc., that diff users have / don't have, Google believes it already has enough info on a machine / location, that they don't need to ask for a phone   Don't know.
Different countries have diff regulations for email providers, ISPs, etc.  That's fairly well documented.  Some countries have more "pro user privacy" laws or regulations than others.
And as others point out, it - seems - might be a big difference in using Firefox /w several privacy addons vs using Android OS.  I don't have Android, but is it possible Google can already get enough info from an Android device, that there's no need to ask for verifying phone   Google *funded* Android development - correct? Given Google's - proven - privacy violation record, is it safe to assume they *may* be getting more info than Android users would like, or are aware of?
Recent replies to the original topic have nothing to do w/ GMX, per se, which is why another user & I changed the subject, but others accidentally replied to an older post w/ original GMX subject.  Still, overall info of keeping anonymous when using various services is obviously of great interest.  Might take a team of people (or be impossible), but given the constant interest in how to sign up / protect anonymity using Tor w/ specific services, would be extremely helpful to have reasonably *updated* documentation on how to sign up or use Tor w/ specific services.
Have the info posted on one web page (w/ links to specific topics), rather than get lost in this list's archives.  I appreciate earlier efforts on torrifying apps, etc., but much is outdated.  AFAIK, there's not much in a central location on topics like, "how to sign up w/ ABC, XYZ using Tor."  Then instructions on how to *use* Tor & a service (like webmail provider) w/o compromising anonymity.   Yes, it would require constant updating as providers' methods changed.  I KNOW it's difficult to write or compile such info, but I see lack of documentation for avg users, as a huge limiting factor for getting more Tor users (thus, more anonymity).  Problem: if Tor / TBB become hugely popular, even many "democratic" countries may ban it?

@_subject: [tor-talk] effect of Tor exit IP addresses listed on a few 
1st, this isn't a "GMX" thing, although their (canned, I believe) replies to support questions, got me to wondering in a much broader way - what are overall effects of any exit node IP address being on even 3 or 4 blacklists out of ~ 75 blacklist sites? Generally, I don't have problems w/ sites saying Tor addresses are on some blacklist (or denying access), but I don't sign up for dozens of sites w/ Tor, either.
I checked several (not dozens) Tor exit addresses on the "list of blacklists" page above.  Ones checked (U.S.), most showed blacklisted on a few  of the ~ 75 blacklist sites shown.
Many showed up on the same few blacklist sites, again & again (as if those sites blacklist all Tor relays??).  Don't attack me on this, because I know little about it & definitely didn't do extensive research.   Just curious.
But blacklist sites below & a scattering of some OTHERS kept showing Tor exit IPs  repeatedly, while vast majority didn't.
xbl.spamhaus.org; zen.spamhaus.org cbl.abuseat.org Perhaps if I'd checked DE exit addresses, they'd show up on mostly US blacklist sites, if at all?
I wonder how many (at once) of blacklist sites are monitored by forums, email providers, etc., when try to register / login w/ Tor?
Several of the ones shown seem to be German (perhaps coincidence) for US exit addresses.  If a signup site monitors any of these, then...?
Depending on a site's policy, if 70 / 75 blacklists DON'T blacklist an address, that'd seem like a good bet to allow.  Then, I know little about various sites' decision process to ban addresses.

@_subject: [tor-talk] effect of Tor exit IP addresses listed on a few 
Well, after ~ 6 emails w/ GMX support (I'm QUITE sure applies to many other sites), they finally responded HOW they monitor blacklisted addresses.  Probably many sites use the same resource in deciding to block (Tor) addresses.
Since there are sites on "whatismyipaddress.com's blacklist-check" that seem totally dedicated to tracking / listing Tor addresses, seems a good bet _any sites using this list_ will block many / ? most ? Tor addresses.  So far, I checked ~ 12 exit addresses from US, DE - all showed up on *a few* sites on whatismyipaddress.com's "list."
Some blacklisting sites (JUST examples): tor.dnsbl.sectoor.de, torexit.dan.me.uk apparently list (blacklist) all Tor addresses.
According to one site,  they use sites that specifically list Tor addresses, such as shown below.  I'm sure many other sites use similar, explaining why many Tor users can't login to various sites.
_DNS blacklist_....................._short description_
exitnodes.tor.dnsbl.sectoor.de 	"A list containing clients where Tor runs on."
torexit.dan.me.uk 	"A list of tor nodes online in the tor network. This list is updated hourly with the tor network."
Since tor.dnsbl.sectoor.de (one example) is *always* listed on whatismyipaddress.com, AND appears to blacklist many / all Tor addresses, it's a foregone conclusion, _any site using it_ will block most / all Tor addresses.  I'd guess Tor users that were able to register on *any* site (like GMX) that use whatismyipaddress.com/blacklist-check, just got "lucky."

I forgot - did someone say they keep cash & extra phone in a safe deposit box (pre paid or contract?  Contract phone is no use in a police crack down)?
If a deposit box, judge could freeze that too, so better hide it in someone else's house.  And what are they gonna say about that?  "I need to hide a phone, money, gun, etc. in your basement."
Even though I might think some of it's vaguely similar to preparing for a hurricane, most of my family would have me committed.
Though I empathize w/ him (read below), if William hasn't been charged w/ ANY thing, there's not much need for a full legal team - just yet.  Sure, he's sweating bullets - innocent or not.  But that doesn't translate into spending huge $ right now.  An attorney can't do anything (if he's truly innocent) unless there are at least some charges to start thinking about a defense; they arrest him, etc.
Unless William's goal is to get his equip back quickly.  A lawyer could file motions, but probably wouldn't do much good - at least for now.  It does appear that one in his situation would be building a defense fund before there is anything to defend against.  Now, if he could promise to pay everyone back, proportionally, for what wasn't used for defense... but how could one do that?  How would we make them, if they decided not to?
What if the defense fund is needed because he actually did something illegal (not necessarily porn)?  I agree, that in these VERY beginning stages, a guy w/ the credentials he's presented, should have the means to pay an attorney for an hr or 2, to tell him what to do / not to do, until such time that he's arrested, charges are filed, etc., (if ever).  Right now, that's all  he needs.
*How do I know?*  Cause I was put in a similar situation - of the *possibility* I might have to defend myself against false charges - unrelated to issues in this case.  I got basic advice on what to do / not do for now; have cash for bail bond, in unlikely event I was arrested.  (Believe me, they could've arrested me & asked questions later).  Then, nothing to do but wait... and wait.  Nerve racking.  Lost bunch of weight when needed to gain some.  But, didn't need bunch of money.
I didn't have equipment or belongings seized, but police never "told" me anything later on, like, "We're not filing charges;" "the DA isn't referring this to a Grand Jury."  Nothing, nada.  No, "Sorry we came to your house w/ no justification & threatened you."  No arresting the other person that made false accusations, even though there were witnesses.  Even then, I only needed a lawyer to advise me of basic rights, of prudent behavior till something did / did not develop, etc.  No giant defense fund needed.  The whole thing just... disappeared.
How much is 10,000 EU anyway - $100 USD?
There's a reason I'd never run a Tor exit or probably relay.  I'd like to.  If raided, I could never take the stress.  Too old now, w/ chronic health issues.  Plus I wouldn't want to spend my retirement savings hiring lawyers, if things got really ugly.
And people call me paranoid...
I should get started on my dooms day supplies & cash.  I don't know where to keep it.  We live in hurricane territory & you have to prepare way in advance of knowing whether the storm will hit nearby, or it's too

I think I understand your point, but if Tor (or anything else) isn't really anonymous, there's no point in advertising it as anonymous. Unless you're selling snake oil.  If gov'ts (or other groups) can get what they want, when they want, out of an ISP, exit relays, etc., then it's only anonymous as long as no one's interested in what you're saying or doing.  Meaning, it's not really anonymous at all.
If being anonymous, or more specifically, having anonymous communication is outlawed (& it almost is, in practice), then there will be no Tor.
The conundrum:  if every thing that has some useful purpose is outlawed because someone can also use it maliciously, or LEAs make so no one wants to touch it, then most everything could be be banned - by that line of thinking.
gasoline - gone.
2" x 4" lumber - can be used as weapon - gone.
baby diapers - can be used to smother someone - gone.
kitchen or butcher knives injure / kill thousands around the world each year?  They're not trying to outlaw knives over 5 inches, because they pose no threat to a gov't.
Bottom line is, no gov'ts want their law abiding or criminal citizens to communicate anonymously, because it takes away power. Yes, they want to catch criminals (& we want them to).  No, they're not concerned in the least if 90 - 99% (or what ever) of Tor users don't break the law.  If they catch criminals AND stop people from using Tor, running exits - out of fear, they killed 2 birds w/ one stone.
The internet is really the best thing invented to allow gov'ts of the world to keep tabs on all citizens ( though they say they're only after criminals).  When people still wrote letters, (most) gov'ts couldn't scan EVERY letter, just to see what popped up.

Thanks Anne.  Laws in virtually every state (U.S.) & country are different - yes?
I think I understand what you said, but not sure why it'd be so (in U.S.)  In a situation that LEAs SAY they suspect a crime, one's personal data (say, credit card info / transactions) stored on "3rd party servers" - (say, Amazon.com) is not protected in any shape form or fashion, from Boss Hogg (aka, an LEA) saying, Amazon - I want Daisy Duke's credit card info.  I don't have a warrant, but give it to me, anyway.  And Amazon has to say, "Sure,"... because of why??
Any business like that storing info would be a 3rd party server - yes?  So no LEA would ever need warrants to get financial / purchase transactions, email, ISP browsing records - ad nauseum,  Habeas Corpus, defacto, oreo.  Because it's your info, NOT stored on your personal equipment.  Is that correct?
Doctors storing patients' medical info, for back up purposes, off site, would be storing it on a 3rd party server.  So, does it become public Or at least Deputy Fife could walk into the back up storage facility & say, I want medical records on a guy that's been sniffing around Thelma Lou, cause he ran a stop sign.  And they must give it to him w/o a warrant?  I think we must have skipped over a few details.

If this is Windows (or another OS- browser bookmarks work similarly), if the bookmarks weren't saved to default location, you'll have to BROWSE to the location in the import bookmark screen.  It doesn't seem to remember any location other than default.  You can easily browse to the correct location.
You * can * also just copy / paste the latest bookmark file (probably the .json format) from the old location / old version into new one.  I've done this many times in FF.  Works same in Aurora.
If you COPY, just make sure it the latest date file (or date you want) & paste it into new version.  You DEFINITELY want to backup existing bookmarks from the version you're working with (if there are any), before copying or importing old bookmark file to replace existing one.  If something goes wrong, you can start all over.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to use Tor Browser without TBB Bundle? 
Don't know about "a script."  Normally, if you want to run more than one version of Firefox (or maybe Aurora), you add the "- no-remote" command after the Target box string (command path), that is found by R clicking the start icon > Properties.  As an example, for Firefox icon, you'd see something like:
"D:\ProgramFiles (x86)\Mozilla\Firefox 9\firefox.exe"
This is the path where the executable file is installed (or in Aurora's case, extracted [not installed] ).  NOTE:  the quote marks are necessary.
So adding the -no-remote command would result in something like:  "D:\ProgramFiles (x86)\Mozilla\Firefox 9\firefox.exe" -no-remote
note:  in the example above, there is a space after ...firefox.exe" and the -no-remote command.  Type it just as shown (substituting the path where the 2nd instance (version) of AURORA you want to run is located).  IOW, put a space between the quote mark after firefox (aurora) and the 1st hyphen, in front of -no-remote
If you were using this in a script, I suppose the use of -no-remote would be the same as described.

I think we're talking about same thing.  Unless you change the TBB profile location, each extracted version (or different instances of same version) uses the profile in that instance's program folder, unless you specify another - as you indicated.  If using the default profile in default location, don't have to specify the profile name (I'm sure most know that - just clarifying).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Adblock Plus and Ghostery should be included in Tor 
Good point.  Originally, at least part of the Tor design was users couldn't be tracked from end to end - period.  Nothing about profiling based on customization.  Now things have changed - obviously.
A lot of users (apparently) don't want to use TBB in its current default state.  That may / may not be good for the crowd and / or them.  I don't have enough deep, technical knowledge to say.
One thing I do know, is the internet, trackers, hackers, gov'ts, etc., keep discovering new tools & refining ways to track Tor & NON - Tor users.  Tor devs constantly have to keep up & try to stay even, if not ahead of "the adversaries."  Overall, they do a good job & I'm pretty sure all but experienced software devs w/ an excellent knowledge of security issues, have no idea how hard this is for Tor devs.
That still leaves the question, should TBB users install addons that haven't been explicitly tested & proclaimed "safe" to use w/ TBB (as safe as the internet or TBB can reasonably be - NOTHING  is or ever will be 100%).  I don't know, but topic probably deserves more "official" Now that Tor / TBB has become internationally well known, to extent some countries already ban it & U.S. (& others) has considered legislation that would affect its overall use, the big problem for users may soon be, "are you using Tor _at all_," not just, could someone profile you from browser / addon settings?
One big question - is it a necessity (no way around it) for sites or traffic monitors to see what extensions are installed or other non - default TBB settings (other than bare minimum, like browser ver., OS, etc.).  I don't understand the problems involved, so I'm asking the "stupid" questions on others' behalf.  Why is it necessary that data like Ghostery (or many other) extensions are installed, be made available to sites from TBB?  Why is it necessary (or is it?) for extension devs to write them so that the extension(s) installed are made known to sites?
[I'm basing the question on many posts to the list about "if users use xyz addon, or change TBB default settings, it's possible to "fingerprint" them].
Why does a site have to know WHAT is blocking a tracker beacon or an ad, rather than just they ARE blocked?  NoScript is included in TBB w/ all scripts allowed in default settings.  So every user has it enabled (by default).  There must be an extraordinary # of customization possibilities w/ that one extension.  If users blacklist one site in NoScript, they're automatically "different."  Cookies are globally enabled by default in TBB, so those blocking them are automatically different.  Is there more risk to users being profiled as unique, by blacklisting ONE site in NoScript (or any other routine changes) than there is by installing Ghostery, AdBlock Plus, etc?
Admittedly, I may not  fully understand the problems here.  When any of many cookie managers / blockers (aside from native Firefox / Aurora) blocks cookies, I don't think the site knows "Cookie Monster is blocking cookies," does it?  It just says, "Your browser isn't accepting cookies."  Maybe I'm wrong & sites DO know it's Cookie Monster??  But if not, seems the same principle would (often) apply to blocking beacons, ads & many other things using extensions, would it not?  Using TBB, sites don't have your true IP address, true geographical location, etc.  Why do they need to know which extensions are installed or the settings of them?
Don't shoot the messenger - I'm just asking some questions that I haven't seen discussed - here - in detail.

Good point, but that would result in another "project" for Tor Project to develop & maintain.  Many would agree w/ you & some of Tor devs * might * (in theory), but I wonder how realistic that undertaking is currently?  Perhaps if funding for Tor Project were much larger & there were many more developers.
Right now, many AdBlock users are upset because it's developers have decided to "allow some non intrusive" advertising, by default (though users can opt out).  If Tor Project DID develop something like this, it'd probably be better for Tor users than installing untested addons.
I have no idea if this is feasible, but could someone from Tor Project approach (any) appropriate developers about developing (or allowing branches of) these or any other addons that Tor Project thinks are truly useful?  It's true these 2 aren't open source.
The issue of these 2 addons needing to update lists (during an anonymous TBB session) can be solved by turning off automatic updates in the addons' options - yes?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Adblock Plus and Ghostery should be included in Tor 
There may be some overlap of functions, but they each perform (at least some) very diff functions.  That becomes clear when read the basic description of each extension.
I honestly DON'T know if NoScript, appropriately configured, can do everything that AdBlock and / or Ghostery can, because it is a very complex extension, even for above avg users.  If one is a "No Script Guru," they may know the answer.
One question is, even if NoScript can be configured to "do" everything AdBlock & Ghostery can, would those be appropriate settings for Tor users?  Even though NoScript is included in TBB, users changing all sorts of default settings isn't necessarily a good idea, w/o knowing (through accurate testing) all implications to anonymity of TBB.  That's just for NoScript.  We have no idea of ALL implications of using AdBlock Plus & Ghostery, much less all 3 together.  Unfortunately, I've seen very little documentation from Tor Project about changing default settings in NoScript.
I'd personally like to see some "official" Tor Project documentation on configuring * some * NoScript settings in TBB.  Even if it said something like, "Except for options XYZ, leave everything else in NoScript the hell alone."

Neither have I gotten a msg about "you may be using a privacy-oriented browser extension..."  That's a generic error msg & could mean anything.  Why not contact Ixquick?  I did once (not about your type error) - the support person that replied by email was quite knowledgeable & helpful.  Try that w/ Google.  I have no affiliation / connection to Ixquick / Start Page at all.
I've used Ixquick & Start Page w/ Firefox & TBB.  There must be some particular combo of extensions you're using.  It's unfortunate, but some extensions interfere w/ some sites.
Now, if you're using several "untested / unapproved" extensions in TBB, they may not work together.  Many extensions state upfront that they conflict w/ other.

Again, the msg you are seeing may not accurately describe the problem.  Question:  are you using their https address?  Try that - besides, it's more private, as explained in the * verification of Ixquick's privacy policy *:
Their privacy policy has also been certified by Certified Secure.
Before calling them an abomination, you can't know what the problem is at this point.  I've used "privacy oriented browser extensions" & Ixquick for years.  It may be a simple problem or something they're not aware of.
If trying to use their Advanced Search & save settings, it requires a cookie (or instead of a cookie, can create your own persona URL, containing your advanced search settings).
Until users actually know what the problem is w/ any software, website, they probably shouldn't bash it (just general observation) w/o even trying to figure out what the problem is.
I'm pretty confident that Ixquick doesn't care about users hiding private info from them.  They don't require cookies (for basic search), no java, don't use web beacons / trackers, don't log IP addresses (at all) or keep search terms.  That's pretty private.

@_subject: [tor-talk] on the topic of tor's weaknesses 
Thanks for the link, Xinwen.  I have a more basic question regarding the original question of adversaries somehow getting access to BOTH entry & exit nodes, that lots of users probably are curious about.  Re:  getting enough data (even if they could break encryption, if using * SSL *) to do any good.  Since Tor / Vidalia changes nodes often (is it at least every 10 min, at most? - & more often if a circuit fails), could an adversary get enough data about ONE user to do any good?
In this case, is the threat that the adversary will ONLY be able to identify that one is USING Tor network (not capture the actual data transferred), assuming they have access to the * originating IP address,* going to the entry node AND also to the exit node?  I suppose (for now), adversaries in repressive countries determining that one is USING Tor is a big problem.  Not so much in "free" societies, but that could change.
What effect, if any, would Tor changing relays more frequently than the current default time, have on ability of adversaries tracking users (in a meaningful manner) from entry to exit nodes?
In Tor network, does the data packet size & order, in & out of entry or exit nodes necessarily HAVE to be the same?  Would it be possible to make the  in & out packet sizes different sizes, or mix the order of packets at an exit vs entry node?  (I don't know the technicality of how this would work).  If you d/l a torrent (as an example), you don't receive the file pieces in order.  Is it theoretically possible  the Tor network could develop a way to mix up the packets (of a file), within the network, so that even if an adversary had complete access to a given entry & exit node(s), the data going in one end could never be matched w/ data coming out?  (don't answer too quickly!  Never say never)
This is also somewhat similar in concept to the old data correction process, where pieces of a file might be re transferred (due to corruption), much later in the d/l process, after most of the file was already downloaded.
The theoretical concept I'm pondering is, could all pieces of data transmission through Tor be scrambled (the order and / or size) on purpose?  Adversaries generally can't read the actual data because of encryption (if I understand).  If there was also no correlation of packets (to an outside observer) at one end vs the other, how could they ever track a user by traffic analysis?  Adversaries would theoretically have to monitor ALL relays, ALL of the time.
Even then, how would they track a user, end to end, if the packet order is purposefully & randomly jumbled within the network?  It seems that the current Tor network model will come under ever increasing attacks / monitoring & needs to change the fundamental way it operates.
To some avg users, it might seem there is no way around a determined adversary determining they are using Tor (with current Tor network If an ISP sets up an entry relay or bridge & exit relay, you could be If a user goes through a proxy to Tor, and an adversary runs the proxy (how do we really know?), you could be screwed.
I could go on & on w/ scenarios.  Lots of people throw around the phrase, "Users have to determine their threat model..."  Quite honestly, most people wouldn't know how.  For avg users, advanced users may as well say, "We have no idea.  You're own your own.  Don't assume you'll be anonymous, even if you follow directions exactly for using Tor / TBB."
OK, so instead of everyone shooting down my ideas, modify them so they might work, or come up w/ other better ideas, instead of continuing to put band aids on the current technology that seems to be fraught w/

@_subject: [tor-talk] on the topic of tor's weaknesses 
1st, thanks for reply.  You misunderstood (I think).  I didn't mean the order packets are sent / received to & from the EXIT node (from final destination site).  I meant the order of packets being switched BETWEEN the exit node (receiving pkts back from destination site) AND the original entry node (now delivering pkts back to Tor user's ISP.  I meant mixing order of pkts INSIDE the Tor network.  Perhaps also adding enough junk pkts to make it impossible to correlate pkts returning from destination site to exit relay, with those leaving the entry node, back to user's ISP.
Now, router firewalls know what data was requested & typically deny anything - inbound - that wasn't requested.  But, could there be a way around the pkts being in the exact same order when they left the website as when they leave the entry node back to the ISP?  TCP?  We don't need no stinking TCP.
This is where looking at changing the fundamental way Tor network handles the pkts comes in.
Your reply is the type of beginning to look at completely different ways the Tor network would handle data.  It will take a lot of people thinking outside the box.

What are others' opinions of these setting in NoScript in TBB (latest TBB 2.2.35-4)?
1) In Options > HTTPS>Behavior, the "forbid active web content unless comes from an HTTPS connection.  Default is "never," but there is a choice of  "when using proxy (recommended w/ Tor)."
What are some lesser known issues of keeping the Never default setting?
What ALL active web content is it allowing by default setting of "Never" What are some of *desirable* sites or content that could break if set it to "when using a proxy" ?  That could vary depending on a user's geographical location.
2) Under "General" tab, default is "scripts globally allowed".  I suppose Tor devs chose to leave this as default, as many sites won't work well w/o JS.
But, to allow scripts globally - in an anonymity software like Tor?  No mention, AFAIK, in Tor documentation of what things users should consider about various settings in NoScript.
NoScript has many other security functions besides allowing / disallowing scripts, that most users know little about.
Yes, you can white list sites you want to allow, then disable "allow globally," but you'd better back that list up regularly because of frequent TBB releases & any NoScript updates.

Re:  Get $.  Probably.  Just like a lot of other free software get funding from installing search engines or toolbars.  But no one has to use Google search or even keep their search engine plugin installed (in TBB, Firefox, etc.).  Just install & use the other "privacy respectful" search engines.  "Non-Profit" orgs have to get funds from somewhere.  Some don't like Mozilla's business deals w/ Google - others don't care or even know there IS a relationship.  A lot of people don't like Google, in general, because of their past privacy invasions (some of which they still do, per Privacy Policy).  Many obviously don't care.
Bottom line:  in any business, if people don't like a certain company or product & want other competing companies to succeed, that conduct their business in ways that's more palatable to the customer, then customers must support / use those other, often smaller companies.  Else, there won't be much competition to choose from.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Google as default search engine revisited 
1st, there's no such thing as a free lunch.
Adware isn't the same as getting funding for including something that can easily be (1) avoided totally by users, or (2) removed completely from the software by users.
Or, if including a search engine in browsers makes them adware, then most browsers are adware, by that definition.  In TBB & other browsers, users have complete control whether to use any search engine or not.
I personally don't like Google, but I'm not forced to use it in Tor nor Firefox.  I have NO idea if Tor Project is bound by any legal ? requirements to leave Google's search engine in Aurora, since they are just using Firefox & modifying it.
Others can correct me, but I'm guessing that IF users "follow directions" of using TBB, the data that Google searches would be able to mine is not the same as if using stock Firefox, IE, etc.  They certainly wouldn't get your real IP address, therefore not be able to tie searches (say, under court order - or lack there of) to users' real IP account / name.  Again, if users don't like Google, just don't use it in Tor or anywhere else.
It won't make you any "safer," but if you wish, del the Google search engine plugin, completely.  That'll fix 'em! :D
In latest Windows TBB, google search plugin is located:  \Tor

It might be a stretch that the "majority" of [TBB] users want google.  I don't really care what search engine others use - whatever they want.  I've not found a huge difference in quality of search results from engines like Ixquick vs google.  Maybe it depends on WHAT your searching for.  Many don't know if other search engines are suitable, because they've never tried them.  Folks use google or bing for exact same reason vast majority of people use Windows - because that's mostly the only OS that non Apple mfgs put on machines, not because Windows is inherently better than other OSs.  McDonalds is the largest restaurant chain in the world, but not because they have better food than any other.
An earlier comment, "because it's the default engine in Firefox" holds no water, if Tor Project gets no funding from leaving it the default engine.  Many users (even for TBB) will just use default settings & default search engine.  Maybe other easier to use (no "captchas"), more privacy conscious engines could be made the default but still include google in the list.  If Tor users that want google can't figure out how to select it from a list...

The difference, I believe, is when there is an option of either opening the file w/ some application(s) or d/l it, Tor browser / Torbutton warns that not all applications will preserve anonymity, if launched inside Tor / TBB.  Whether you get the pop up could depend on how you have set the browser (& perhaps certain applications) to handle diff file types.
Like in Firefox, under Options>Applications, you can set PDF files to "Always ask," "Save," or "Use ".  If a file type is set to always save it to disk, you probably won't get the pop up you mention, because no application is going to try to open it vs saving to Most files COULD be opened, instead of saving to disk.  What info might be leaked to compromise (in some way) anonymity, depends on the app & how it's configured, if it is configured to use the Tor network as a proxy, how well it handles using it, etc.  I think most would agree, while using Tor, it's safer to save the file to disk, then open it.  Depending on WHAT type file, maybe opening / running it after closing Tor.  Especially if not d/l from a known, trusted site & you're not absolutely sure what the file is & does.  Others may have more insight on specifics of this.

Thanks for all replies.  It doesn't change the (sort of) tongue in cheek comment about being a brilliant move on Google's part.  ESPECIALLY  in light of Google's new (non) privacy policy, where they can / will / intend to? track users across all their services.  In & of itself this isn't * solely * related to html5 content, but it's certainly a big draw to get users to set Google cookies.
My question to those more knowledgeable about these cookies that google sets, & their NEW privacy policy, is how it affects Tor users?  Among other issues, once Google sets a cookie, I don't believe there'd be any difference in Tor / non Tor users, how Google is able to track you across their different sites / domains.  The only diff is they'd not see your real IP address.
Since "traffic analysis" seems to be a huge issue for Tor / Tor users, how is being able to track Tor users across multiple sites not an issue?  Seems it'd be fairly easy to use this to identify individuals, if someone wanted to.  Unless using settings / addons to prevent it, they will have a lot of info about you Users really need to read the ENTIRE Google privacy policy.  If not taking steps to prevent (Google) from gaining details about your machine, etc., even if users delete a cookie once they leave youtube, etc., then go to another google site that requires cookies, couldn't they probably identify the same computer?  Many Tor users will forget to del cookies, since TBB default settings are to accept cookies.
The bigger issue is, today it's Google doing this, tomorrow... who knows?

Thanks for the input.  My point exactly.  Most users aren't going to completely close TBB after visiting google sites.  I imagine even a very large % of Tor users, much less avg internet users, have ever read Google's new privacy policy, have any idea of their capability to track users, etc.  Your point is well taken, but I doubt a majority of TBB users will close the browser, after they leave a google site & make sure that all google cookies are deleted (ALL google pages & probably sites linked from google pages).
One could use some cookie mgr addon that allows for temporary cookies, that are deleted when a web PAGE is closed, but most won't do that either.
Of course, this may be the least of worries for users of TBB or any other anonymity software / methods.  I assume at this point, TBB devs aren't concerned about google (or any other) tracking cookies, or else TBB wouldn't come w/ cookies enabled by default.  I'm not sure why they wouldn't be concerned - maybe there's good reason.  I don't know the answer to that.

Many other list subscribers & I hounded on dropping Google as default search engine in Tor Browser. Some didn't get why, were opposed or had no opinion. Mike Perry announced in the Trac change request that now StartPage will be the default search engine. Some won't agree w/ dropping Google as default search & that's understandable - UP TO a point.
Whether the following info about Google's "activities" could OR ever did * affect TBB * & esp. since it has nothing to do w/ the search engines, per se, ISN'T the point. It's Google's overall, complete disregard for any kind of privacy & violating its OWN & OTHER companies' privacy policies, TOS & violating agreements between companies & Google. In short, they & others like them will stop at nothing. It's not opinion; it's track record & records of lawsuits they've lost.
That's why Google search engine shouldn't be supported or endorsed by organizations dedicated to internet privacy & anonymity - because of Google - the company's - long standing, complete disregard for privacy of users' & companies they do business with. It's not JUST a matter of whether Google's (& others') practices - in any manner - can affect TBB.
Some of these links / articles aren't brand new - but if one searches, more & more new revelations are coming out what Google AND others were & are still up to. Again, not directly related to search engines. But, if doing business w/ the Devil in any manner, all bets are off. TBB or any other browser users can easily add Google search engine plugin or make it their default, if desired.
NOTE: TBB default settings are to accept all 1st party cookies, w/ 3rd party cookies disabled. Some report that disabling 3rd party cookies (in Firefox) will stop Google from setting its tracking cookies associated w/ its "Safe Browsing" feature. ** Safe Browsing is ALSO disabled by default in TBB. However, in the other linked articles, Google & other companies were circumventing the browsers' rules or settings & presumably they could / would do the same in FF, if at all possible. NOTE that vanilla FF enables 1st / 3rd party cookies by default.
If you have trouble falling asleep, there are many, many other articles - some very recent - about Google & similar companies using "super cookies" * & using special (fake) code * in cookies in order to trick browsers into accepting them, when browsers would otherwise reject them.

A lot of mail providers seem to require js, but maybe others can suggest some (or methods) that don't require it.  I'm quite sure some providers don't require js.
2) AFAIK just for that session.  But, if it's for an email acct that you tried to create anonymously thru Tor - IF - say Gmail, tied you to a real IP address & provider, then you don't have much anonymity for that acct from then on.  That's assuming anyone, including Gmail cares to pursue it.  I'm assuming it warning you about accessing help at rt.torproject.org means using your mail client.  In their default state, email clients CAN leak info about you.
Which external content (type) & which application is it trying to use?  It does make a difference.  Yes, some can leak certain data.  Some apps can be "torrified," to lesser or greater extents.  Instructions used to be on the Tor documentation site for diff apps, but may have been removed.  May also be wiki articles.
3) See ans. # 2.  It's an "it all depends" question that comes up often.  It's not so much the site (unless they use advanced tracking techniques & you have js enabled, etc.), as the external app being used.  In general, heed the warning about loading external content, if true anonymity is desired.   The application could matter because it dictates the type of application needed.  Part of it depends on what you're trying to conceal from whom.    NSA?  You may be screwed.  You'll have to research IF the apps needed (& specific one you use) can be torrified or leaks worse than another.  Probably look into Tails or I've probably created more questions, but the upshot is, you have to educate yourself when it comes to using external apps & Tor.

I'm guessing a large # of above avg to advanced TBB users are turning off js in No Script - at least some times.  Problem is, Tor Project has no way of knowing the  so no way to quantify (even theoretically) how much it increases their browser uniqueness.
I don't know if your answers are totally / partly / not correct, but they are similar to my limited understanding & gut feeling.  PERHAPS if the adversary is a hostile nation w/ complete monitoring of entire internet traffic, ability to search ALL ISP's records / logs AND resources & inclination to track down one user that has js turned off, because he accessed a "forbidden" web site, the previously posed scenarios might be a threat.  I don't know & certainly don't know how hard it would be, even for a nation, devoting those kinds of resources & time.  I'm NOT saying it's next to impossible - I'm asking.
Due to the ever increasing electronic internet monitoring activities of LEOs in the U.S., I'm sure most would be surprised at their capabilities.
If * * * making changes to TBB settings, addons, etc, poses a REAL risk, it might be a good idea for Tor devs to put a warning in big, red letters on the browser start page & on the Tor Project TBB main & d/l pages.  Perhaps links to, in laymans' terms how making any changes from default TBB settings, what so ever, could lead authorities to your door.  I'm sincere - if it's that much of a risk, the current info / docs aren't nearly prominent or clear enough.  If it's not that much of a REAL risk, that should be explained also - how / when it MIGHT become a real risk.

Thanks Maxim.  You may be 100% correct.  No disrespect, but these questions - esp. one about changing TBB setting(s) like js or using an addon not included in the package (assuming an addon doesn't "leak") seem like PRETTY important questions.
I think one of the devs w/ expertise in that area of Tor should answer the * real world explanation & chances * how those actions would realistically allow someone / entity to positively identify a PERSON, or lead them to that person's door, so users can understand.  Explanation should also probably be in FAQs.

The most recent versions of TBB & No Script's default settings under Advanced>External filters, is not to block hulu.com, .youtube.com.  The content type (I think) refers to shockwave|futuresplash.  How - OR IF - No Script's blocking ability of "evercookies" w/ its settings as it ships w/ TBB & sites like * Hulu * that (at least in recent past) were * confirmed * by several privacy investigation projects to be using evercookie / Kissmetrics.com tracking cookie technology.  These cookies are NOT blocked by disabling all cookies / all 3rd party cookies in Firefox.  Even if they were, TBB ships w/ allow all cookies enabled.
One of the many ways / places (up to 12 - 15) that the js loaded evercookies can be placed is as an LSO / flash cookie.  There are many other traditional & non traditional places these cookies are stored.  AFAICT from reading research, these cookies CAN transmit data that could compromise Tor users' anonymity - as they certainly can in Firefox.  They are also very difficult to del & "stay" deleted (thus, sometimes called Zombie cookies).  Deleting cookies by "normal" means does NOT delete them.
Numerous research reports that I've read say one of the only ways to block these is disable js for most sites (as in, using No Script), but that supposedly makes users more susceptible to fingerprinting, by only allowing certain sites to load js content.  Yet Hulu was one of the worst offenders for using evercookies (I don't use Hulu, BTW), but is whitelisted in NoScript.
Have Tor devs looked into THESE special types of cookies & if they potentially compromising anonymity or even increasing chances of fingerprinting, due to information they transmit about every site you visit?

I think one of the issue (may) be that even though evercookies wouldn't see you "real" IP address, they would be able to track you across multiple websites, incl. all URLs, pages / links you click on, what you d/l, etc.  They are able to transmit that data back to the mother ship.  I'll leave it to Tor "experts" EXACTLY how that could be used by either the companies gathering the info, the sites (where the evercookie was set) that were paying them to gather data, or adversaries trying to fingerprint Tor users (if that's possible using evercookie data).
I would think - certainly in countries hostile to Tor (or ones that aren't) - they could set up fake websites in order to set evercookies just for tracking purposes.  That might or might not lead them directly to a person (again, experts can weigh in), but it would give them info on how many users are accessing certain sites & what they're looking at.  There may be other things I haven't thought of.

Maybe there should be more discussion about these types of cookies (most aren't even aware of them or their capabilities), how to PREVENT them - to extent possible & how to clean them up.  They are NOT easy to get rid of if they've been placed in many / most of the known locations they can Also, FAQ on them.  I read the design links for New Identity &  the bug links, but I didn't see how that handles ALL the known locations where evercookies can be placed.
Another view is, "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."  I think educating users how to avoid them, to the extent possible, would be good.  They're often easier to avoid than eradicate.
I can't vouch for these clean up utilities effectiveness on evercookies.  I use them, but haven't tested much on evercookies.
BleachBit claims it will clean evercookies (recent versions).

@_subject: [tor-talk] google analytics says it can track across separate 
A few months ago, someone raised the question of TBB or any included addon not blocking web beacons / trackers and perhaps something like Ghostery should be included in TBB (I think).  I asked about beacons (web bugs) compromising anonymity (not to mention privacy).  Can't find the post, but I believe either Mike or Roger replied that it shouldn't be an issue because web beacons, like Google Analytics, can't track from site to site.  Hope I've got the essence of the reply correct.
That didn't sound quite right, so eventually looked a bit more.  I'm not quite sure what to make of this, but doesn't sound good.
 From this Google Analytics site And from the later version of Google Analytics, There are other independent articles I've read about ability of web beacons to track across sites.  Here from the horse's mouth, * seems * to be verifying in a matter of fact, ho - hum way, they can & do track across completely separate domains.  Unless I've completely misread it.
I don't know what this means to Tor users, but as a Firefox user, I don't want them - & always suspected they were capable of doing more than gathering data ONLY on the site where they were 1st loaded.  BTW, have many read the new Google "unified" privacy policy?

Thanks.  Then thinking about the cross domain tracking ability of web beacons (or that they could) must have changed since this was last discussed.  At that time, as memory serves, regarding beacons in general & idea of using Ghostery or something similar in function, it was said to be a non issue for Tor users.:-)
The design document draft, dated Dec 28, 2011 doesn't seem to mention web beacons.  Other than in a non specific way, the document doesn't seem to address how to handle them.   They aren't cookies, so don't fall under cookie control (in current or future browser designs).  Yet, they can track across domains.  A lot of users (Tor & non Tor) don't understand this nor are even aware of them.
Presumably, as they are loaded w/ pages, even w/ disk cache turned off, they can still be stored in memory cache & still track users, unless memory cache is disabled.  True?
Is there a reason that using Ghostery, or similar technology, couldn't or shouldn't be used until / if a design change in Tor / TBB prevents web beacons from being loaded w/ pages?
Perhaps the downside of using an addon like Ghostery out weighs the benefits for TBB users?  I'm not married to it, but haven't seen many other similar solutions for beacons.  Disable ALL image loading...
It does have options not to auto update blocking elements, if updating during * critical * Tor sessions was an issue.  Other than that, I'm not an expert.  I think the concept of web beacons is extremely deceitful for any browser & should under consideration by Congress to be banned, as are evercookies.  In the mean time... what about looking into Ghostery, etc., at least w/ suggested settings until something better is devised by Tor Project?
Re:  Flash LSO cookies in Windows.  The Dec 28, 2011 design document If you can't get Flash to use a settings file - for now - maybe next best thing is education.  I'm thinking there should be a prominent file in TBB, containing a number of IMPORTANT changes that users should make; name it something like "you better make these changes or you may die.html," that opens w/ a new browser install.  The storage settings for Flash are fairly straight forward, w/ a little explanation, even though users must go to Adobe's site to change them (tricky, huh?).  Even I could write / "borrow" instructions on how to change settings in Windows Flash manager, for better privacy.  Cookies & disk storage can be prevented totally, but if you del the "settings" cookie, all Flash settings revert to default.

Browser "companies" are in business to make money.  Even as a NFP, Mozilla still has to make $.  How do browsers make $?  From deals w/ companies involved w/ advertising.  If browsers made it impossible to track users, negating the targeted ads concept, advertising companies wouldn't pay browsers or web sites for the right to track their users.
Maybe, but for now, TBB has NO way to block cross site tracking web beacons, AFAIK.  Some protection seems better than none.  In addition to disabled disk cache, we could turn off memory cache & disable all images - not likely.

I used the term "web beacon" too loosely, rather than as specifically 1x1 GIFs.  Similar to how "trackers" is often used to describe a single beast, regardless of their function.
There are of course, several types of technology that are often loosely referred to under the general "tracker" term.  I didn't do a good job, but in my original question a month or so ago & again today, I meant to include java script trackers as well.  Many of the "true" trackers - w/ cross domain tracking ability - are java script.  Google Analytics is only one of many.
I think that those voicing a concern w/ these & TBB, were concerned w/ the trackers most difficult to stop.  Are you saying that * tracking scripts * are ALSO isolated per URL domain in the cache (see quote below)?  So that cross domain tracking isn't possible in TBB?  If that's not correct, then there's still a big problem for now.
When you speak of sandboxing:
If running an app in something like Sandboxie, (maybe you mean a diff scenario), it is protecting the OS / machine from the APP.  It doesn't stop a browser (or, I assume, trackers; Flash) from connecting to the internet.  Maybe it would have value once the browser is closed, Flash proxy bypass has already occurred.

I may be confused about TBB's ability to either stop * ALL * trackers or render them harmless for Tor users' purposes, but I'm not confused about your rudeness.  I resent the hell out of that.
Some vectors I might be concerned about are the many bug reports you've pointed out; Flash isn't controllable.... no need to list all unresolved issues - you pointed out several.
Maybe you smell like a money grubbing hack trying to tout semi anonymous software, for * some *  $ & the attention it brings you. :D  How do you like being disparaged w/o any basis?

Time wasting troll?  I'm not a mindless drone that accepts everything at face value.  I contribute a lot to this list & I've come up w/ some ideas (or co-ideas) that were incorporated.  I contribute a lot more to the list than I get out of occasionally using Tor.
I think the problem may lie, not in the student, but in the teacher's explanations.  I used to have some professors that got mad when students didn't understand or if they questioned the professors' logic or calculations.  Who's fault was that?  And no, we haven't covered ALL the different types of tracking cookies (as if they all behave the same), in any detail, "a few dozen times" - not in this list.  Not even a few times.
Professional programmers sometimes talk over the heads of very educated, but non - programmer users.  Most of Tor's user base probably aren't programmers & if it grows like it needs to, most will definitely not be programmers.  Now, if * some * of the programming crowd wants to talk down to & even insult non-programmer users (many, if not most are very patient & helpful), that are trying to understand how or if Tor works, go ahead.   It won't help build the user base.
As far as me questioning how or if TBB handles something, you act as though there isn't a constant stream of bug fixes.  Just because * anyone * says something (ANYthing) works - w/o question, doesn't make it so.  What we think works today, turns out to have  bugs (or someone found a hole) tomorrow.

Most everyone's read the advice about not using extra addons / plugins in TBB, due to possible anonymity leaks.  I understand.
TBB is already slow, which is understandable.  Using "stock" TBB that allows ads & possibly other items increasing bandwidth is far slower on many sites - even news sites - than same TBB version w/ just AdBlock Plus.
Sometimes so slow, it's not worth using it.  In tests - _at the same time_ - using another TBB install w/ - only - AdBlock Plus, vast majority of those slow sites w/ big or multiple ads load much faster.
Since addons are a no - no, & since TBB often loads sites w/ ads at a snail's pace, might it be possible to modify TBB or verify / modify some addon, so most ads will be blocked & anonymity will be safe?
It already uses addons for other purposes, that checked for any info leaks.  Blocking ads isn't Tor devs' main concern, but they should be concerned about usability.
Some say, those sites need revenue to keep running.  Fine.  But they don't have to have multiple *extremely* _graphic & script laden_ ads, that slow TBB page loading to a crawl, sometimes making it unusable.
There must be some reasonable middle ground somewhere.

@_subject: [tor-talk] ads slow Tor Browser dramatically 
I wasn't suggesting that TBB absolutely try to use AdBlock Plus or any specific Fx extension.  I'm suggesting the concept of somehow limiting ads that by their size, design & content, dramatically increase page loading time.
Who would "maintain" this new function?  I guess the same people (or additional ones) that maintain Tor Project & try to attract new users.  I've done many side by side tests, w/ & w/o AdBlock. Often, pages time out before loading, w/ all ads enabled & load fairly fast w/ ads blocked.  Again, I don't care about AdBlock, per se.  Tor Project could develop their own extension or functionality.
One of the most repeated concepts is, the more users on Tor network, the more anonymous users are.  By TBB's very design & lack of any control over ads,  it keeps droves of potential users away, reducing overall Yes, it's expected Tor network will be slower than regular internet.
No, pages shouldn't fail to load because of far too many or "over the top" ads, on an already slow network.  TBB devs design it, Vidalia, Torbutton, etc., so whatever they deem necessary is blocked or limited.  Everyone talks about needing more Tor users to increase anonymity, but part of TBB's design & all the ads / scripts, sometimes making it one of _Earth's slowest creatures,_ discourages millions / 100's of millions of potential users.  Ads aren't inherently bad.  I'm suggesting that too many ads on a page, or ones so large or of a design that slow page loading to a crawl & greatly increase Tor network data load, limits growth of  new Tor users.

Using Win TBB 2.2.39-5.  Noticed a popup from Tor, saying a particular port was being used by an application that could leak info.  Besides that SAME port  that many pop ups repeatedly mentioned, noticed many similar warnings in the Tor log.
Investigated several "warning" addresses in my FW / network log & none were showing up for in or out activity - for any application.  Thought, "That's strange."
I'm looking in Kaspersky's network monitor, that shows every open port for every active app.  Even ones shown for Tor didn't match the warnings in Tor log file.
Then opened Tor network map & the message log, side by side & saw the warning addresses / ports were relay addresses, showing up in the relay map.
The warning addresses in the log, as they rolled by, were identical to the various relay addresses - repeatedly, not just one or 2.  I looked at dozens of addresses in the log warnings & they were all relay addresses.

For the last relay in the network map list, the addresses building, then immediately closing, were flying by like a stock ticker.  I refreshed the network & waited till it stabilized.  That *somewhat* slowed the # of addresses building / opening, then immediately
closing.  Result was the same.  All addresses being listed, where "one of your applications [apparently Tor]  established a connection through Tor (then lists address), using a protocol that may leak information.... "

Sure, I could.  If a Tor dev w/ "the power to make changes" says blocking ads would definitely be considered, if data were provided showing increase in data downloaded & longer page load times. Otherwise, would be an exercise in futility.
Forget speed for now - the additional data load of all ads on the entire Tor network has to be large.  No tests needed to figure that out.  Whether it's a good idea to block ALL ads is another subject.
Even in regular Fx, the difference is often many sec longer to load w/ all ads allowed.  Don't have to do scientific tests to know it's way slower.  But, for the times I had a status addon showing page load time, could be anywhere from 3 - 60 sec longer w/ all ads allowed, depending on the page & the actual content & # of ads.  Repeating the process many times on diff days / time, clearing caches between each reload gave a pretty decent avg, eliminating ISPs / servers being overloaded, etc.
Though not a valid, scientific test - loading Mozillazine Forums Index page in regular Fx (don't have a monitoring addon in TBB right now):
W/ AdBlock Plus:  81 KB loaded; 2.59 sec
W/O AdBlock Plus:  86 KB loaded; 3.96 sec
Again, consider the additional data load on ENTIRE Tor network.
The "w/ ads values" on given site will change, as the ads delivered change, by the min / hr / day.  Mozillazine isn't particularly overloaded w/ ads.  Time & data difference between ads / no ads can be negligible or dramatic, depending on the ads.
In TBB, the "proof" is in identical instances of TBB, except one had AdBlock Plus.  Again, I'd rather Tor project develop something on their own, or at least monitor / verify that any addon used is "safe," as they do w/ HTTPS Everywhere, NoScript.  Though I'm not sure how often & thoroughly Tor devs "test" an EXTREMELY complicated addon like NoScript - yet, they use it.  There's a reason an addon (_like_ AdBlock Plus) is most popular addon from MAO.
Pages in TBB can time out before loading, w/ all ads allowed, in addition to Tor network slowness.  Same pages w/ ads blocked usually load faster (if they have many ads).  How much faster depends on the site, # & type of ads, relays used in Tor network, etc.  Doing same general comparisons over weeks, months, gives a better representation.  If ads significantly affect regular Fx, why would TBB be different?  If anything, ads might affect TBB more - mainly pages timing out & also making a slow network even slower.

@_subject: [tor-talk] ads slow Tor Browser dramatically 
Thanks Mike.  I'd probably agree w/ that & was aware of that potential issue.  The ad servers don't care if their ads are delivered to an anonymous user, as long as they're delivered.
But individually, many users don't want them - for the reasons you stated & speed issue.  Unfortunately, some sites have such large, pop up, flashing ads, you can't see the page.  And some are very persistent.
Sometimes, even respected sites have them on "special" occasions.
Regardless of political issues, I stand by my statement that *some* pages have too many / too large of ads, causing TBB to time out, at times.  I suppose the time out period could be adjusted.
But, it's a long time to wait.  Political & finger printing issues aside, same pages w/ ads blocked usually load much quicker.
I never said it'd be an easy or good decision, but I suspect the extra load on Tor network from ads is much larger than most would think.  If pages in TBB or Fx often take 3 - 5 sec longer to load, that's substantial.
I'm only using AdBlock as an example.  But in reality, if 90% of all TBB - English users had [something like] AdBlock & they all used [something like] either "Easy List" or "Fanboy's List," how easy would it be to fingerprint one among all TBB - English users?
I'd guess it'd be more of a problem for small groups of other languages.
Which safe browsing filters are those?  Not Google's?  Because they're disabled in TBB (fine w/ me).  NoScript?

This is off topic, but your comment made me think of a battle a few yrs back between corporations / offices & "fax marketers" sending out advertising to company fax machines.
The idea (& objection) was the marketers were using the companies' machines, electricity, paper for free, to advertise.  Not sure what became of that or if it's a non issue now, w/ email being dominant.
It's the same concept of why ISPs & even gov't cracks down on email spammers.  Clogging up the system & using others' resources for free, when the spam isn't welcome.

I've seen some forums recently saying they've decided to deny registration w/ any free email service, including Gmail, etc.
Reason usually given is too much spam is generated from those free accts (using the forums' bandwidth / increased data use).
So far, I haven't seen a lot of forums going this route, but it seems more common than a few yrs ago.
That sort of ties in w/ my post about ads slowing down TBB page loading.  But, advertisers (& on some sites, if you check, there are TONS of ads) are using every users bandwidth & increasing their data usage.
Every home user pays their ISP & usually has a data limit / day or / mo.  Ads cause more transferred data - for home users & Tor network.  It might not be in Tor Project's best interest to block all ads, but in non Tor use, I block them because of slow down, some are obnoxious, increasing my data usage & the possibility of some being malicious.
I'd be happy to allow a couple of small ads on most sites (ignoring safety issue, for now), but most don't stop at one or two.  And they have to be LARGE & shiny to grab your attention, meaning larger & larger data size.

All that may be true.  But you don't have to use any addon to run into same situation.  If you're in a small enough sample (say using Spanish TBB) & Win XP on a site where you're the only one w/ those characteristics, it shouldn't be hard to pick you out of a crowd.
Anytime sites or ads set image tags - or anything else, that the same (real or "fake") advertisers / adversaries can follow, all bets are off.  It's my understanding that TBB prevents sites / advertisers, etc., from tracking users, site to site.
I believe referer.header is enabled by default in TBB.  I don't see how there's ever any complete anonymity as long  information in the browser header is sent.  By no means is everyone's machine / system / TBB exactly the same.  Win, Mac, Linux - different ver.  different languages.  TBB would have to fake everyone's info about OS, language, etc.,  the same, but then returned page results would often not be correct.  If an adversary has the resources & willing to spend the time, I expect they could "identify" many Tor users.  But, I'm no expert.

I don't know.  I just know the reason(s) stated.  Since I don't see tons of forums banning free email accts, I wonder why the sites that aren't banning them?  Unless somehow their servers, software, etc., don't even let most spam hit their server.
Once it hits the server, even if filtered out, it's already increased data load (if they have a limit that would conceivably be approached) & takes up bandwidth.  Maybe some sites banning free email don't want to deal w/ spam in any shape, form or fashion.
Or maybe they have some economic arrangement, if all their users have "big ISP" email, who are also possibly tied closely to big advertising companies?  As they say, "Follow the money."
Sure.  But it ties right back into one of the reason forums have given (that I've seen) & a plausible reason WHY they're banning free email.  Excessive spam for forums (which is comparable to excessive ads for users), increases data load, eats bandwidth.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is using JavaScript with Tor browser safe? 
Short answer is no, if you don't change a bunch of default settings in TBB, or don't use addons / plugins (that just happen) to be ones that COULD leak your identity.  ONE of the ways that MIGHT happen is if an addon you install doesn't use the Tor network / proxy (port that Tor uses) & bypasses Tor to connect to internet.
The NoScript addon included in TBB (w/ settings that Tor devs believe are "safe") - does allow JS, because many pages would partly or totally not work w/o it.  But NS has many other safety features that prevent MISuse of JS, and many other features.

That article mentions OS X / Linux, but I don't know that the issue of Tor using other random ports (in the FAQ) does NOT apply also to Windows?
Is there any security / anonymity difference, if Tor or TBB uses ports other than 9050?  e.g., 127.0.0.1:6xxxx
If I have say, Thunderbird configured to use the Tor (TBB) proxy - 127.0.0.1:9050, then that's what my FW - network monitor shows it's using.  But shows TBB / Tor are using other ports.
Mostly still on local 127.0.0.1, but not port 9050.  With another application configured to use Tor (or no other apps using Tor), Tor also uses a few "regular" IP addresses, in ADDITION to 127.0.0.1:xxxxx addresses; probably DNS lookup, or similar.

Yes, you CAN run unmodified Fx & the Tor proxy, but NO, it won't have the settings & modifications of TBB, that provide extra anonymity.  TBB is modified & Flash content (Flash Player) disabled for a reason.  It can leak your identity or make it easier to identify you.  If you don't care so much about that, maybe Tor isn't needed at all.
Don't know if there are apps / addons that allow d/l a flash video to disk, w/o playing the video - at same time capturing it.  Even if, extra apps / addons can present anonymity problems.  NoScript also blocks Flash, by default - for a reason.
The purpose of TBB isn't really to watch flash vids anonymously.

Chris, I agree in principal - about all sorts of illegal activity. But how could that be done w/o *someone*  overseeing all the internet & deciding what should / shouldn't be accessible, becoming judge & jury?  I don't know a good solution to this old question.
Sure, pedophilia is illegal in most countries & rightly so.  But in many countries, accessing Youtube, Twitter, or political info sites is also VERY illegal.  Tor doesn't operate only in the U.S.
Even if Tor Project decided your idea is worthy, isn't that a bit like car mfgs enforcing speed limits?  A large % of internet users say they don't want censorship, but if anyone's going to shut down sites or stop access to them, that *violate laws* of a given country, shouldn't it be the government of that country?
Ironically, many gov'ts today, including the U.S., were founded by violating current laws or defying the gov't in power.  In the U.S., we celebrate that every July 4th.  Citizens all over the world applaud their founding fathers for ignoring existing laws or existing gov'ts in power, to promote freedom.

Off topic reminder - for anyone - posting on mailing lists.
Unlike email, where replies are often place at the top, above quoted material, the general convention on mailing lists (AFAIK) is either to put replies inline, right after a statement / passage you want to reply to, or at the end of the quoted material.  Unlike email where usually only one person is reading the material (& likely wrote some / most of it), potentially hundreds are reading mailing lists. Sometimes they pick up in the middle of discussions.  Replying after the quote lets others more easily read what you're replying to.

Is it a huge issue to avoid these sites, or is it just the idea that some using Tor can access these sites?
There are plenty of other anonymous proxies, even daisy chaining them, or first using another site that masks IPs, before using proxies; using public hotspots while wearing a ski mask, that could be used to access illegal sites / material.  Tor isn't the only anonymity game in town.

Often sites I try to access w/ TBB time out almost instantly, where in Fx (23) same page, at same time - loads OK.
The pages aren't "Tor aphobics" - as they will sometimes load in TBB.  Part could be THE IP address being used in TBB, to access a page, at specific time.  Some IPs could be on a / their black lists.
I'm not sure when using Tor proxy, the about:config *"network.http.proxy.keep-alive"* applies in TBB, but it's not present in TBB, by default.
But it's in Fx.  1st, in Fx for the similar *network.http.keep-alive.timeout* to work, *network.http.keep-alive*  must be true.
In TBB, there's no *network.http.keep-alive* entry (or "...proxy.keep-alive", if it exists) and no I'm guessing? this results in sometimes almost instantaneous timeouts?  In some cases, could be the sites timing out Tor Network connections or specific IPs from Tor?
May be coincidence - not tested it extensively, but when I add "network.http.proxy.keep-alive" entry & set True - in TBB, same few pages I have problems loading in TBB, seem to load more consistently and Anyone have insight on this topic?

I've forgotten the specifics of your OP.  Exactly how much are they demanding (Eu / $US)?
Other BIG factor (others familiar w/ European / German laws can comment):  Do they have any SUBSTANTIAL proof, that a judge / jury would accept as reasonable proof, that YOU did something under your country's laws, to make you financially liable to the plaintiffs (for anywhere near what they're demanding)?  And is the amount enough to make it worth the lawyers' time to go to court (how much would the LAWYERS make on a per hr basis, from their cut of the awarded amount)?
I'm no expert on legalities in other countries, but ONLY as a general rule, in U.S., it's not worth a law firm's time to actually go to court over fairly small amts, if working for % of awarded judgment.
In U.S., I've failed several times to get lawyers to take my cases against others on CONTINGENCY, even when I'd likely win, because - as numerous lawyers put it, "There simply isn't enough $ involved."
If a law firm is working on a per hour basis (which I'd doubt for this type action), then lawyers get paid for time spent, but plaintiffs may well owe more than they are awarded.  Most plaintiffs aren't that stupid.

There are people associated with Tor / very knowledgeable about problems of exit relays & to some extent, laws in certain countries.  If you haven't gotten in touch w/ them, I suggest doing so.
But Simon is correct - send any correspondence to the via certified, return receipt mail (U.S. postal terms, for mail w/ a record of sending & record of recipient's signature for receipt).  They also tend to know "you're serious" when the letter is sent certified, return receipt.
In many US cities, there are free legal services / advice on civil matters, available once or twice / mo, depending on the city.
I have OFTEN talked my way into getting a few min of free time for short consultation w/ lawyers, by just calling their office. Sometimes, I've paid a small amount for 30 min consultation (that often ran over 30 min, but wasn't charged any more).
(please seek others experiences on this same matter in your country; or legal advice - if you feel the need.  I know NOTHING about German law, but I know a great deal about U.S. / my state's laws)  Do what you wish w/ my writing here - or nothing at all.  You may be able to take some of it, adapt it to LOCAL laws, plus info from Tor Project's "form letters" & then compose a very convincing letter.  Or write a draft letter, then have a lawyer revise it. That would probably cost much less than walking into a lawyer's office w/ absolutely nothing for him to start with.
When my spouse sued an employer, she had a "free" lawyer, board certified in Employment Law, through a type of "Union."  I drafted and / or edited / amended many of the letters that went back / forth during the long grievance process, which the lawyer sometimes revised (sometimes sent as I'd written them).  Many times, I pointed out things he failed to include in the letters and final settlement agreement, that he conceded were good ideas.
My take is they are acting more like a bill collection agency (in the US), hoping to scare people into paying up.  They likely know from experience, some will pay out of fear.  Some won't - but it costs very little to send threatening letters.  If it's that kind of a fishing expedition, my experience is once they find out a person is aware of the legalities of a situation, they back off.  It's not uncommon for them to offer a "reduced settlement" amount, as a last ditch effort to get something.  A lot of people then jump at that, to get them off their backs.
One thing I can say w/ certainty - 506 Euros is probably NO where near enough for an attorney to agree to actually go to court.  Which is exactly what they'd have to do, to get money, if you refuse to voluntarily pay.
In the US, NO, NO, NO lawyer would agree to actually take a case to court for ~ $679 US.  For that amount, ALL they will do is write some letters.  To take a case to court, they'd require $2000 US - probably more - from their client, unless they were taking it on contingency & TRULY believed they could win a judgement of many thousands.  Then, in U.S., they would get (by contract) 33 - 40% of the judgement.  What's 40% of 450 Euro?
Believe me, I've tried to get lawyers to take cases on contingency, but none were interested because they said either there wasn't enough $ that would be awarded (even if we won) and / or they weren't confident that the case could be won, based on laws & circumstances.  Unless I was willing to pay a hefty, non refundable retainer ($2000 - $5000 US), they said "no way" on cases that didn't involve 10's of 1000's of $.
BUT... it depends on laws in YOUR jurisdiction.  _Is it *ILLEGAL* to RUN a Tor exit relay in (Germany?)??_  That's 1st & foremost. Legally, what would be the difference (or liability, if any existed) in running an exit vs. entry or middle relay?
If anyone, anywhere (democratic society) were to d/l copy righted material through a mainstream, commercial ISP, would the copy right owner sue the ISP (or be able to), because the file was downloaded through their server?  I doubt it.  I personally never heard of such a case.  The ISP may warn or even terminate the user's service if they are notified about d/l copy righted material, but they're never sued (AFAIK).  Yet, copy righted material is downloaded 24 / 7 / 365 through mainstream ISPs.  They MIGHT even be able to stop some of those transfers, if they wanted to; but still, no one ever sues an ISP for this.
It's true, a large ISP may have more $ to fend off any lawsuits, but I've only heard of music / video industries suing the PERSON(S) that downloaded the file, presumably for their use - NOT sue the downloader's ISP.  By that analogy, any ISP could be legally liable for any & all copy righted / protected material downloaded through them.  They would go bankrupt in a few weeks.
Did you touch, see or even KNOW about the file(s) in question, until they notified you?  Did you use it; benefit from it in ANY way; entice the person to d/l it; show them where / how to d/l it?
You certainly didn't host the files or even have links to them.
*Tor experts:*  Could exit relay operators realistically monitor & STOP transfer of such files, even if they wanted to?  How would they know, at a moments notice, if a file was copy righted, & stop the transfer - any more than an ISP does ?  ISPs don't, do they? :)
These are all (likely... depending on local laws) factors that establish any sort of liability.  They can ask for $10,000.  That doesn't mean you legally owe anything.  That depends on local laws.
Other than exit relay operators are often "little fish" w/ few resources to defend themselves, (others more experienced w/ exit relay legalities can chime in), how is a Tor exit relay any more liable for what is transferred through their server than a regular ISP?  Other than exit relay operators are probably easier to scare than ISPs.
In the US, anyone can sue anyone else or threaten to sue / ask for out of court settlement, for ANYTHING.  That doesn't mean they'd win anything or the case wouldn't be thrown out by a judge.
The law or some legal precedent (in most countries) has to state that a party is legally liable for a particular action.  Even then, (I assume in most democratic countries), it has to be shown that a person's action meets one or more of CERTAIN criteria, that varies by jurisdiction:
The alleged action IS illegal.  (If that's not clear, no lawyer will take a case & try to establish new precedent for 506 Euros).
The person actually knew about, should have known about and/ or was LEGALLY responsible for the alleged activity; and that they had some reasonable way to stop the activity.  Or that in a GIVEN situation, you are legally responsible TO BE aware of what is transpiring and LEGALLY responsible for stopping a given action.
Do Tor exit operators (in Germany) monitor the contents of ALL data & have the ability to check if it's copy righted / illegal, & have ability to stop the transfer of such data?  Are they legally required to do so?
Perhaps it's time for Tor Project, as a non - profit organization, to look into developing some legal strategy, language, agreement - similar to what ISPs have (or other non profits), in order to use their service ISPs have TOS warning users against many things, including the user will not use their service for any illegal activities.  And they put all of the legal liability on the user.  And apparently, laws of most countries allow them to do so.
Unless relays are only run by persons or corp's. w/ deep pockets, the Tor project can't keep letting relay operators take all the legal responsibility by themselves & expect the organization to prosper.  This isn't some underground organization.  In actuality, ISPs are no better / worse than a Tor relay operator.  Except ISPs get paid.
Knowledge is power.

Other providers "rarely keep backup logs," & some like Lavabit, "usually delete logs of incoming mail within 7 days.  Records of outgoing mail are deleted as soon as they are delivered."
Like you said, (true) privacy is the users responsibility.

How difficult is it to get an acct w/ risup if you "apply," rather than have 2 recommendations from members?  I don't know any  riseup members & forgot how you get the recommendations from members, to riseup.
I don't have a problem w/ their political & social stance - it's a free country.  I'm not sure what they look for in the "application" to approve or reject an acct.
How well do they handle support issues?  Only by email?  Typical response time for serious issues?
Due to their low storage limit, I guess you just immediately delete msgs when d/l w/ a client?  Attachment size limit is very small.

I went & read a LOT on their site.  One problem is, they say it may take 1 day or 10 to answer a support request.  "They're all volunteers."  That's fine.  Except if the support issue is your acct is locked, not because of your actions, 10 days is a long time to wait.
I didn't see if they offer aliases (or disposable addresses).  I assume not?  I've never had an email acct get hacked (yet).  Either lucky or because use strong PWs & nonsensical security answers (if used) that no one could guess or even friends would know.  But, I've read a good way to increase security (as hackers ramp up their game) is w/ provider that offers alias addresses, open an acct w/ a "real" address.
Immediately, create an alias address (maybe a name you wanted, anyway) - that links to the real (main) address.  Don't ever use the real address,  so no one ever sees it.  Would make it much harder to hack when no one has the *real address*, that's needed to login to the acct to make acct changes, or even request by phone to reset the PW.

Sure - there's nothing private about it.  Most data I took right off the provider's TOS & Privacy Policy (or verified The Simple Computer site's data).  I didn't fill in all "items" on all the providers.  Some policy specs weren't mentioned by some providers. You can ask CS if they don't have some "privacy" issue in writing, but a verbal / email reply probably doesn't mean much (legally, at least), if it's not in their official TOS / Privacy Policy.
One item is how long providers retain mail, after you delete it. Some don't store at all; - to hrs / days / months / indefinitely. VFEmail's storage falls into indefinitely category (though not on my chart).
I've never had a need to u/l a file to a free server, so if someone could give suggestion of a simple, free one (file's only 100 KB).  I see no need to encrypt it - unless I'm overlooking a reason. Nothing private, sensitive.
Had an interesting response from VFEmail CS.  Though I've researched "more privacy conscious" email providers a while, I'd over looked one thing.
Unless you encrypt the email - yourself - BEFORE it hits their server, ANY provider can & does read (scan) the email, *at least for spam checking* - at minimum.  Many of you know this & probably many don't.
What else they say they do / don't do with scanning results (or anything to do w/ privacy), like any other agreement / contract, is only as good as the company that wrote it.  And if they violate an agreement, only recourse is to ask them to stop or sue them.
I asked about this one sentence, out of VFEmail's - ONE - paragraph privacy policy:
VFEmail responded:
As I said, wrote that before thinking, all providers scan unencrypted mail for spam, at minimum.  That may not violate privacy, if that's ALL they do.  If you really want privacy, use encryption.  BUT... you have to convince a lot of people to do the same.  Not easy, in my experience - outside of a crowd like this list.
I suppose even providers offering encryption of files while on their server (like Lavabit), could read the mail just before it was encrypted offer "end to end" encryption.

Sorry, but when I tried the download from Bayfiles, clicking on the big, orange download button, it tries to d/l "iLividSetupV1.exe" instead (& I can't seem to get around it).  It actually transferred me to another site - for the "free download manager." Here:
I had no idea it would do that, as I was just using the suggestion from someone here, to use Bayfiles as a free u/l site.  I apologize.  Don't know if it does this all the time.
When I clicked on the MUCH smaller gray d/l button, near middle of page, it starts the d/l count down, but when waiting time's up & click d/l - it goes back into another 120 sec count down (using Tor, for me).
So, maybe I'll use another site, if someone has a better suggestion.  Again, sorry.

That concept of "feds" forcing Hushmail send targeted users a modified Java applet, (that does the encrypting on client side), so their pass phrase could be captured, is discussed here:
I don't know if Hushmail still offers a method to encrypt email locally, before sent to Hushmail servers.  But for any that do offer such a feature, it's possible w/ a court order, or something such as a National Security Letter - NSL  - they could be forced / coerced into doing something like that.  That wouldn't affect majority of users, who aren't direct targets of investigation.
That said, BEFORE the Patriot Act in U.S. (& now similar acts / laws in other countries), no one would've dreamed it would be so easy for LEAs to get "private" email - even encrypted ones.  So what's next?
Interesting fact:  I've read documented correspondence (issued by an ISP) that ISPs & probably email providers, get paid QUITE a bit, to gather & turn over data requested in NSLs & maybe ? for other LEA requests.  We're not just talking chump change.  Big providers get LOTS of requests to turn over data each yr.

Nick, you could be right about a scam - at least warrants some consideration.  But in many countries, if one breaks an actual LAW, there's no *requirement* for anyone to give the accused any "warning" or Cease & Desist Letter, before filing civil or criminal charges.  In civil law issues, they MIGHT give a warning (like to take down copyrighted material from a website), but they certainly wouldn't be required to, if they can prove you broke laws & if the damages allowed by local law / courts for a given offense, make it worthwhile to file a law suit.  If it's legit, they either have enough evidence or they don't.

Thanks Nick.  I "translated" the 1st page you linked.  It's a bit rough, but the main theme seems to reference downloading, P2P sharing, etc., of the file(s) and possibly ? hosting the file for d/l.
A Tor relay does none of those things, unless Hendrik also did some d/l'g from the same Tor IP.  Assuming he did NOT:
The lawyers may / may not know how a Tor relay works.  They may not care.  They may just cast as wide a net as possible & see what they can haul in.  They likely don't care if persons are actually guilty, as long as they make money.  They know / hope a certain # of people will pay out of fear / ignorance or because they actually d/l a copy righted movie /  game.  Lawyers regularly try to get money out of persons having no legal liability to pay anything.
The lawyers are either ignorant how a Tor relay works or just on a fishing expedition.  They may / may not know Hendrick hosts some torrents & figure he had a hand in torrenting this movie. Again, they probably don't care if he's guilty of anything, as long as he pays.  If I were to run an exit relay (which I probably wouldn't - for this type reason - until things change), I would not host torrents on the same server, even though they may not be copy righted.  It could create appearance you're also in both the torrent hosting & Tor relay business.
If Hendrik hasn't left any details out (intentionally or not), he doesn't seem to fit into the type persons they're targeting (based on the translated web page).  He didn't share the file, didn't d/l it, didn't host it.  I would put those details & some other facts / explanations, I mentioned in earlier post (or have a lawyer do it) & send a certified, return receipt letter to them.  I'm guessing in Germany, they have the burden of proving he ACTUALLY did something illegal.  Other than explaining the facts, as a good faith act, he doesn't have the burden of proving he's innocent (AFAIK). Certainly not in response to what's basically a form letter.
Unless in Germany, you're responsible for anything someone d/l's through your server.  But then, as I said, the ISPs would quickly go bankrupt.  Unless they have "special immunity" from such liability.

Will the real Mysteriousflyer please stand up?  Maybe the list admins can trace the 1st mysteriousflyer & your emails, back to the origin & gain some knowledge.
I don't know about the dual use / acct hacking, but if you send unencrypted data through a Tor exit, a malicious relay operator could capture it.  This is & has been well documented for ages. "DON'T send any critical data, if not using secure connection (or encrypted file) through Tor."  Treat it like you would dealing w/ your bank - you wouldn't do business on a non secure connection (with the destination site).
Do you use gmail's https connection - both w/ Tor & w/out?  You should.  If you don't, they could have gotten your PW, if using a regular browser or Tor Browser.
If you use gmail's (or any) https connection, it's no easier for an exit relay to steal your PW than anyone else, AFAIK.  It's still an encrypted But, as news stories point out, there are many ways for hackers / con men to get your PW other than running a Tor relay.  If your PW wasn't that strong, they could easily hack it using software.  I assume they didn't have your PW reset, but that's another way hackers do it - if they can guess security question answers, or they know you or something about you (or can look it up).
How would they make a copy of a debit card through Tor or your Gmail acct?  Do you keep a picture or all data of the card, unencrypted in your email acct?
Also, using a credit card is generally safer than debit cards. You're better protected by the contract of most CC companies.

All the replies make good points.  Question - how do we know which is the real Mysteriousflyer, or if there are even 2?
The latest one hasn't responded how or w/ what he was accessing his Gmail acct.  Sometimes from public wifi?  There are too many unanswered questions & variables.
Has he checked for key loggers or trojans, that could capture his PW?  One simple way hackers get a PW.
He didn't answer if always used encrypted connection to Gmail, or - as mentioned - if ever got a security warning & ignored it. Don't know about Gmail, but some providers still allow clients to use unencrypted If uses a laptop / phone, has he ever left it alone, while logged into Gmail, or PWs are unsecured?  If uses an email client, are stored login unprotected?  Many other factors.

OK, much of this has nothing to do w/ Tor or Tor browser, per se.  I don't run "this joint," so I can't tell you what / what not to discuss here.  Much of the situation would perhaps be better discussed on a privacy forum. Wilder's Security forum has a good section.  Another is on Neowin - the internet security forum.
But, several things you describe *could* be the root of some of your 1) As mentioned, Tor Mail isn't associated w/ Tor Project.  Beside, JUST using tor mail, by itself, has little to do w/ anonymity, AFAIK - from reading about them.
2) From what you describe, Tor probably isn't your problem.  It's your security practices (or lack there of). :(
It also sounds like you might open an email attachment (when NOT expecting it), click on links in email - even just to "unsubscribe."  All those can load malware on your system. Sometimes, it's very difficult to detect, once on your system.
To be anonymous w/ email, you must open an acct using Tor & NEVER use anything else to access it.  You can use their webmail & it should be fine, if you're not doing stupid things w/ Tor / TBB.
If you used a BU email acct (for PW reset or what ever) w/ the Tor - Yahoo acct, & if you EVER accessed the BU (tor mail) acct from your real IP address, then the anonymity of the Tor Yahoo acct was blown.
No one can get lazy w/ PWs & not have problems, sooner or later (I assume you meant: not strong, not completely random, not very long).  Especially on high traffic / high target sites like google or email providers.  If that's the case, your former hacker probably knew things about you.  That & good PW cracking software is likely how he got your PW.  Use a PW manager & generate STRONG, random PWs, not something that involves any of your personal data, email acct names, etc.
I get the feeling that there's more to "your hater" story than you let on (& more than ANYone here wants to hear). ;)
Unless you're using a GOOD method to replace all characters.  All the simple, easy ways to replace say, letters of your email acct, are used in PW cracking software.  If you feel you MUST memorize it, use methods endorsed by security experts.  Just best NOT to start w/ personal data, that someone could know / guess / search for.  It still needs to be > or = 15 chars: upper / lower case letter,  special characters.  Twenty to 25 chars is MUCH better, for safety from PW cracking software.  Use a PW mgr that autotypes - like Password Safe or Keepass - both free, open source.  Have portable versions.  Get them on Sourceforge.net
3) NO!  If using an https connection, that security / encryption has NOTHING to do w/ Tor.  TOR ENCRYPTION ends at the exit relay.  HTTPS (SSL / TLS) encryption does not.  Unless, someone / some site imitates or hacks the site you were trying to reach, & then usually you'd see a "Security Warning" from the browser, about being unable to verify the security certificate.  Most people just ignore those, w/o checking out the situation.
Even if someone stole an email provider's cookie, it wouldn't do them any good because they're not using it on the same machine (AFAIK).  That's the least of your worries.
If someone hacked you before & knows something about you (or knows you), you need to COMPLETELY beef up your security methods on ALL online accts.
Now, if you have more questions about email safety, PWs, general security, I suggest going to sites like I mentioned, or others. Most of your questions / issues have already been answered there.

Did you extract the latest TBB into a new location or over the top of old one?
Either way, when you're sure the version you're using is x.x.x, & if you look in about:config for an entry that lists the tor browser version (& it's different), that's where it's getting the version  & why it's still prompting for an update.
That may not be YOUR case, but it can happen if you copy part / all of the old pref.js file into a new version profile.  Then it copies over the old version   There could be other reasons.
If you did something like that & you KNOW you're using the latest version, you can either try extracting it again, or just change the about:config value.

FWIW, I logged into my Tor Yahoo email acct using TBB.  I got in fairly easily, but it didn't like the 1st captcha, even though it was easily read.
It gave another easy one & after entering, it said "you're logging in from a computer we don't recognize."  (duh).  So it asked me a security Then it let me in -  in German language.  So, I guess the exit relay was in Germany.  But, they had an American flag icon.  So, they haven't deactivated my acct, yet.
It's entirely possible if you don't log in the time period before they inactivate an acct (I have gotten a regular, inactive acct re activated on Yahoo), they might not reactivate it, if they know you're using Tor.
Even if I wasn't using Tor or a German IP address, how do they know if your a traveling sales person?  I guess that's good security effort on their part, but a poorly worded, canned reason to ask for the security Yahoo.de front page seemed a little racier than U.S.  My Deutch is a bit rusty, but the picture was a young woman (clothed) laying on a young man.

I know what most of the words mean.  I understand much of the context.  Some things I don't understand:
In more simple terms, what do
*"an HSTS token indicating the proper cert for the site is set"*... [set where, & how is it stored, for how long?]
  *"because you must catch the very first connection on an _empty browser store_."* mean?
This paragraph is confusing, in relation to its preceding paragraph:
"That said, it's still basically effortless for an exit node to exploit it clients by injecting fingerprint-based iframe-style attacks into whatever lowsec http pages you've requested, which gives abu al-badguy, *as an inherent consequence of his fresh root*, access to the *plaintext of your https* connections. Basically, trojaning your box and snagging your un/pw fields clientside *is much more reliable _for HSTS_ sites*."

His subj. said java script, but in the message he said Java.  Not many, if any web mails REQUIRE java.  But many sites, incl. many web mails need js - at least to login.  You might be able to get around w/o js, once logged in.
There's no way around not using js, on some sites, if you want it to work, be able to d/l files, etc.  In TBB, NoScript comes set default to allow js globally.
Never say never - but I don't know that the real risk of js is leaking identity so much as someone running malicious code on sites you don't know or shouldn't trust.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Mail service requires "java script enabled" 
Something to check into:  A LONG time ago, some email providers had a "simple" or "basic" view / page, to login.  It was a separate URL, that may or may not have required js, IIRC.  For gmail, the "basic" login page didn't require html, either.  That may be no more, but at least you could ask - perhaps on Yahoo's forum or in help pages.
I may be way off here, but Tor devs know js is required on most webmail login pages (& many, if not most site logins).
I'm guessing if it is a huge problem / risk of leaking identity, there would've been strong warnings and /or they'd possibly come up w/ a solution.
More generally speaking, things that are warned about are separate prgms, plugins, addons, etc.  Programs & apps vs. a computer language (java script).  Not that it can't be abused - it can & is the source of many infections, problems.  But a site like Yahoo is a trusted, safe site.  As for a 99.9% guarantee that using js to login to a trusted site expert will have to answer.
Another consideration:  There are email providers that don't log IP addresses (or don't keep them long) - at least, per their Privacy Policies.
Some have low storage allowance / smaller attachment size than giants like Gmail, Yahoo.  But, if using it for your more "private" mail (not everyday stuff), that isn't a problem.  Or just d/l the email to HDD & del from their server.
Free accts, that are super privacy conscious and allow much storage are pretty rare.  There are good ones w/ good privacy / data retention policies or don't even record IP address when logging in. Some may have free accts w/ very limited storage.  If they require an alternate address to open an acct, one can create an anonymous acct using Tor on another provider - that allows using Tor (see review from The Simple Computer).  Could then close the acct, or keep - in case need to reset a PW.  On most, w/o alternate email address on file, no way to reset PW if lost (or even if something goes wrong on their end).
One review / list of providers I saw & recently started looking into for just such a purpose is:  which was linked from well known Windows freeware review site, under section "3. Use A Privacy Oriented Email Service": Article on The Simple Computer has good bit of info, including whether some (webmail) require js, which is only a concern if using a browser w/ webmail.  If using Thunderbird & POP / IMAP, js isn't an issue, as it doesn't allow js in messages & you're not retrieving email through a web page anyway.
If you PAY / donate for an acct by MOST methods, someone will likely always be able to track you, if determined.  Here's Riseup.net's take on that issue: TIP:  I've read if you "apply" for risup.net acct, don't go into your political stance, when filling out their form, as they are openly very left minded on political / social issues.  Author of the article on The Simple Computer mentions that.
Other providers that have been mentioned on this list (but each user should thoroughly investigate) any provider's CURRENT Privacy Policy, TOS & other "fine print" on what they will / won't do:
* secure-mail.biz (free version without SMTP support, premium version
full featured)
* VFEmail needs a temporary mail address for account creation.
* Vekja.net offers anonymous e-mail accounts for 100 Bitcoins per month.
Here is also the SAME question you asked in 2011, w/ some suggestions others had for providers.  I guess you didn't find one that suited you?

No, don't think so.  It's a secure site.  Any insecurity would likely be in your browser; presence of  *possibly* insecure plugins (you mention java) and / or extensions (addons); or lack of some security enhancing addons (NoScript & others).
Don't know what this means.
1st, if looking for privacy & a provider not data mining; using mined data or sharing, selling it, etc., Google / Gmail & many other large providers aren't the places for you.
Some details possibly missing.  Were you running a business email acct w/ lots of traffic under a free, individual user acct?
Though I don't really care for Gmail (I have a "junk" acct), their spam filters are generally pretty good (in my *free* acct).
Did you read Google's TOS?   It's straight forward that they'll take / use almost everything except your 1st born child.  Most businesses don't use Gmail, Yahoo, etc., email accts - for the reasons you mention.
But you have to, if you want your data, transactions & business to be reasonably safe.  Every technology requires some knowledge & expertise to use it properly & safely.  Internet's no different.

Don't know if this will always work, for all providers, but I have set torrc to use only exit nodes in my country or same country where I signed up for the acct.
For some providers, that may work.  I tried it once w/ Yahoo, not specifying exit node country & they gave the msg mentioned.
Reset exit nodes, got a *NEW* IP & dialed again.  This time no problem.  THAT time, appeared they were only looking at the country - not city, state, province, etc.
It may not work in all cases, but worth a shot.  If a provider had any sense, they'd allow the traveling user to answer secret questions, etc.
For the less security informed:  Don't choose secret questions like, "What make was your 1st car" or "What is your favorite color," w/ answers like "Ford" or "Blue."  That's like shooting fish in a barrel to a hacker.
Don't choose those type questions, if given an option.  If no choice for questions, answer it w/ a nonsensical answer.  "First car:" = "bug guts

No, I don't think it's the best way.  For some providers, it may be the only way to use Tor.  I think Gmail may do same thing, if try to login w/ exit node from a different country than used to sign up for the acct (not sure).
If truly concerned about attacks / profiling, using a provider that allows Tor would be better.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is using player like VLC safe alternative to Flash? 
Question of playing Flash vids comes up constantly & explanation given of why it can compromise anonymity in Tor Browser.
Anyone done real investigation if using some media players, that handle playing Flash content directly from a URL, are any better at protecting anonymity than Flash Player?
VLC player & SMPlayer (front end for MPlayer) - both open source, free - can directly load the video URL from the page you're viewing (assuming have Flash Player disabled or not installed).
You may / may not have to click the page / video address, then it's automatically copied into the media player & it handles the rest.
Question is, regarding TBB & anonymity, are these safe enough to protect Tor anonymity?
The only circumstance I know of where these 2 players (can't speak for others) would be contacting their servers is to check for updates, which can be disabled by simple settings.

If I understand, TBB disables disk cache & has memory cache enabled.  This is the way I do it w/ Fx, because I've got lots of RAM & it's much faster than disk.  Normally, going back to a page already visited in Fx is almost instantaneous.  Definitely NOT the case in latest stable TBB - or ever.
In TBB, browser.cache.memory.enable is set True.  I've got 8 GB, so by default I believe Fx would allow ~ 32,000 KB.   I even added the entry in TBB about:config, browser.cache.memory.capacity & set it higher than 32,000 KB.  That entry may be deprecated - dunno. It's still slow reloading pages - ones I  looked at 5 sec ago.
What is TBB doing or what is the difference that makes it so slow in reloading cached pages compared to regular Fx?  Should have nothing to do w/ slow Tor network or relays.  On a machine like this w/ very fast CPU, plenty of free RAM & a good graphics card, why should reloading recent pages be any slower in TBB than Fx?

I'm no expert on that.  I'm fairly sure SOME of the info has to be accurate in order for the video to play correctly (that's where my other question about using standalone players comes in).
But some of the info Moritz mentioned & other, could possibly be faked.  Just like they used to do w/ Fx & Opera, when they wouldn't work correctly because websites recognized they weren't IE.
But, a simpler (if less convenient for some) solution might be to use something that doesn't require sending or exposing that info. Which means, not a built in web player.

Thanks - I'll check those out ASAP.  Good while ago, I compared about:config of TBB & Fx - not lately.  This could be some? design issue, a bug or something specific to my install.  Though I've noticed it in several TBB versions.  I don't extract a new version over top of old ones.  I start w/ fresh profile, prefs.js, etc.  What ever it is carries across versions.  Tor is slow enough, but this makes it almost unbearable & I'm pretty sure it shouldn't be happening.  I've GOT to find the answer.
Question for other Windows users:  If you load *pages in TBB* w/ links (almost no graphics), click a link that opens on the SAME domain - in the SAME tab, if you hit Back after a few sec (where original page had virtually NO chance of changing, forcing a reload), does the original page (that should be in memory cache) reload *almost instantly* - or at least in < 2 or 3 sec - or does it take a while - *like 5, 10 or more sec?*
BTW, this isn't on https, where you may get a msg saying the browser will have to resend the request...
If I waited 5 - 15 min to go back in history to the original page, it might have changed & possibly force refreshing the page, but not in 10 - 30 sec.  I see this repeatedly.  If very few others see this, it must be something w/ my setup or system.  Perhaps my AV (Kaspersky IS - 2013).  But, AFAIK it wouldn't be scanning pages stored in RAM, just because they're reloaded.
HOWEVER, on same box, same AV, same browser (Fx 20) setting of using *ONLY Memory Cache*, hitting back button one page, happens *almost

@_subject: [tor-talk] memory cached pages should reload instantly-but DON'T 
Good question.  What do YOU see, when hitting the back button, after having left the original page only 5, 15 or 30 sec ago?  Does it take 30 - 60 sec to reload the original page?
What if a page has ads (whether hidden, blocked or not), that changed every few sec?  Would that force (dupe) TBB into completely reloading the page?  Many pages have ads that change constantly.  I use AdBlock Plus (yeah, I know) - but I'm not in a critical, "my life depends on it" anonymity situation.   *Ads + Tor = VERY slow.* I brought this up a while ago & we discussed it on this list, ad nauseam.  Even EFF has ads, trackers, etc.
Even though the ads are blocked, the scripts on page source have changed.  But that means others NOT blocking ads, would STILL be forced to reload pages in TBB when hitting back button, because the page's *ads changed.*  And it'd seem reloading the page WITH ads displayed would be *as slow or slower* than reloading it w/ ads blocked?
But, reloading a TBB page from < 30 sec ago is also mind numbingly slow.  Those SAME pages with SAME ads (possibly blocked, that may be changing every few sec), still reload almost instantly in Fx.  But... that's not going over Tor network.
Back to square one. Do other Windows users w/ fast machines & plenty of free bandwidth, if reloading TBB pages from < 1 min ago, with or without ads displayed, see it taking 10, 20, 30 sec to reload?  On a VERY consistent basis?
Maybe there's an about:config entry - even if must manually add it -  telling TBB not to reload pages when going back in history, unless... (it's > certain age; or some other requirements)?

For NON gov't entities, in a NON repressed society, does the "adversary" having my "unique browser identity," automatically get them anything?  My "anonymity is broken."  Are they able to just call up my ISP & demand to know who I am and / or that my ISP discontinue my service? (we didn't discuss if having my browser fingerprint means having my name, real location (home address), my ISP, my real IP address, etc.).  I'm guessing no.
If I lived in China or Iran, things would be much different.
There should be REAL WORLD distinctions made on what an adversary can DO w/ the browser fingerprint, based on who the adversary is (that specific is always a "black hole" in Tor documents), where you live & what, if anything, you've done that's illegal in your legal jurisdiction.

Fair enough.  Thanks for your perspective.  I'm just posing questions.
I am a bit surprised that the issue of playing vids in Tor or TBB or Tor developed plugin, no matter their original format (or converting them), hasn't been addressed by Tor Project.  I know... they're limited on Here's an idea:  take one of the well respected, open source, cross platform video players & MAKE IT safe to use in TBB as a plugin, or as a stand alone?  They're already developed, & for the most part - already as safe as anything else.  Why re invent the wheel?
Lots of people in repressed societies would like to watch some political speech vids, for example.  Not that big of an issue in the U.S., unless you're watching militia group vids.  Unless the entire mission of Tor Project is to provide semi anonymous access to written word & exclude video; that may well be the case & have solid reasoning behind it.
Also seems to me that there are PLENTY of talented Tor users that could & would be willing to write patches or entire sections of code for this or anything else - for free, if they were allowed to. They do it ALL THE TIME for other open source apps.  Tor is a non profit, but sometimes seems to be so tightly controlled, that progress moves at a snail's pace.

Thanks for your input, but this thread has gotten way off original spirit of the question.  Has anyone / group (incl. Tor Project) researched using, or perhaps modifying, some open source media player to use in or with TBB.
Or, maybe it should be a consideration for the future.
For NON Tor use, playing flash content in a respected player is probably safer than using Flash Player.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is using player like VLC safe alternative to Flash? 
That is true & I don't pretend to be an expert on vid formats, video players or much of anything.  It is the player(s) that historically were mostly the problem (or usually been the case, in NON Tor use).  Sure, a vid could contain something bad & you really should scan them just like any file, or have a real time scanner to do it automatically.  But it's the security holes / bugs, or even built in privacy violating behavior in some players (Flash) that is most of the concern.
Besides the anonymity thing w/ Flash Player & TBB, it attracts hackers like flies to manure.  [Manure - that's an interesting word that puts together 2 words that have positive meaning: Ma & newer!]
Flash Player CONSTANTLY has to issue patches, meaning it usually has security / privacy holes at any given time.
Compare the # of security updates Flash issues vs MPLayer, VLC or any in their league.  Yes, all apps issue security patches - but few even approach the number or frequency of Flash Player.

I looked at torbrowser.git from link above.  One interesting thing. They show on line 16  pref("browser.cache.disk.enable", false); - but in my brand new extraction of TBB 2.3.25-6, in about:config, it has that as user set ENABLED.  But, I didn't enable it.  The last thing I'd want to do if looking for speed, is use disk cache. Didn't touch the setting in Options nor reset it in about:config; used a clean profile.  Others might check their setting in about:config.  This is kind of a big deal for not retaining TBB sessions on the machine.
In my TBB about:config, browser.cache.memory.enable is also = true (by default).  Only it has a much smaller max entry size than disk cache (which should be disabled): browser.cache.memory.max_entry_size;5120.
So default memory max entry size is apparently 5.1 MB (kinda small if you have 8 or more GB RAM).
I don't know what TBB is REALLY doing when I go back one page in history, but unless that page has expired, been purged from cache, etc., it shouldn't be reloading it.
Maybe it has to do w/ how long I use TBB in a session - I only just opened it today.  But today, going back a page or 2 in history is almost instant - as it should be.  Yet I've seen the slow issue I've described over many versions.  I hope it continues to make a liar out of me.
I'm not an expert on pipelining.  TBB sets network.http.pipelining.maxrequests = 12, though most documentation says  higher than 8 will be treated as 8.
Later TBB versions have network.http.pipelining.aggressive =true, while it's disabled by default in Fx 20.  Some don't agree that it helps at all; in fact, just the opposite on some sites.

Simma'... Do-uwn... a-now, Mike.:)  I think you misunderstood the OPs intent.  He wasn't talking just about WebGL.
If I understood (they can correct me), Tor documents & Tor and / or security gurus keep talking about "don't install a single additional extension, change browser fonts... or you'll be subject to browser finger printing."
OK.  His point was (I think), why MUST TBB users be subject to "someone" being able to get *ALL* of that info from TBB, that allows fingerprinting, upon the slightest changes?
I'm guessing he wants to know why TBB would give a real time zone or a lot of the other data mentioned, that don't SERIOUSLY impact page display, but makes fingerprinting easier?  Why not give out fake data or none, if it doesn't completely break pages?  Why not to the *extent possible*, all TBB users "show" the same data, or none - if it won't break pages?  And if it breaks a couple of pages out of many 1000's, so Why is it necessary at all for TBB to divulge ALL installed plugins or extensions?  And many of the other data that were mentioned regarding fingerprinting?  Surely, all of these don't make or break whether a page If it's script related, why not block scripts that mine data non critical data, that doesn't affect page display?

As Mike Perry pointed out in the link  many of these things ARE either NOT allowed to be accessed by sites or certain info is faked, in all TBBs.  Like time zone:
Reading the entire doc, it appears many of the data that might be available for fingerprinting in normal Fx are either blocked, faked or obfuscated in some way.

I wonder if _instead_ of using addons for certain things in TBB, if the same effect can be achieved by using code in *userChrome.css file*, would that in any way allow pages to gather info on the UI changes, to use for fingerprinting?  I know a lot can be detected, but I don't know that a tab progress bar, or tabs text color can be detected by sites.
Say, adding a progress bar in the tabs (because many pages are slow to load using Tor - not sure if hung or still loading).  It functions like the tab progress bar in addons like TabMixPlus or Informational Tab, but *w/o using an addon.*
If there's no risk in making changes via userChrome.css, I came across simple code that will add a thin progress line across tabs, as loading progresses.  If anyone's interested.
The "throbber" is of no use to me.  It often keeps spinning when pages are hopelessly stalled (until they time out).

Weeks ago I reported problems accessing https Ixquick / Startpage search sites in TBB 2.3.25-12, then *-13 and 2.4.x; then saw it was most (or all) sites using port 443.
Traced it to some issue with Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 (KIS) & its "scan encrypted connections" feature, though never found exact problem.
My KIS settings do NOT cause problems in *Fx 24.x,*  or any versions on secure URLs.  It used to not cause problems in TBB.
Now I've narrowed it to EVERY time TBB is opened, if KIS is closed then immediately reopened, the "blocking" port 443 problem *disappears*.
Blocking is in quotes, cause I really don't know why port 443 is immediately closed, just that KIS is involved.
No special messages from TBB (now 2.4.17b2) when SSL pages won't load, other than generic "xyz.com has timed out...may be busy..."
In the Tor Network map, I can see port 443 try to open, then immediately close when accessing sites using that port.  Until I close / reopen KIS - then problem solved.
The issue seemingly has something to do w/ *differences* between TBB or processes & *regular Fx,* as the KIS factory default settings for "scan encrypted connections" work fine in Fx & port 443 - or any others.
Besides, I temporarily disabled all KIS port monitoring for 443. Didn't change the TBB problem.
AFAIK, the *default* KIS settings are that it's NOT scanning encrypted connections, unless you have KIS *parental control* enabled (I don't).
For some reason, it affects TBB, but seems unlikely the "real" KIS default settings are the problem, as just closing / reopening KIS solves the TBB issue.
If... TBB had a problem w/ the Kaspersky certificate, closing / reopening KIS wouldn't fix that.
I could add TBB, vidalia and Tor.exe to KIS's "do not monitor application's activity" and / or "do not scan (this application's) network activity"  list, but that defeats purpose of having the protection.
Could be a weird KIS bug affecting TBB, that stopping / restarting KIS somehow fixes it temporarily (consistently).  That'd be fairly unusual.

No - least, don't think so.  Not sure what you mean - manual - in this context.  *Could* be some screw up w/ certificate, but as said, w/ current settings, KIS doesn't (shouldn't) scan ANY encrypted connections.  But KIS could have a problem, that it's not correctly using settings that are shown in GUI.  It happens.
Thanks, but no idea.  "Normally," stopping / starting KIS - or anything like it, wouldn't load or reload a new certificate.
If it's doing that, I'd guess it's a bug.  I posted on Kaspersky forum & even long time mods have no idea on this one.
Haven't filed support req w/ Kaspersky - yet, because doubt they support KIS & TBB issues; but I'll try.

Thought I was taking the high road; trying to "defuse" what seemed like a pretty flippant, "looking down your nose" reply.
If not your intent, I apologize.  If it was, may want to dial back a notch.  I'm sure lots of Tor users have closed source AV software.
But, see here - I'm still smiling:  :D, :), ;)
"Why no one responded...?"  Kinda amusing.  Could well be same reason KIS "gurus" / long time mods are stumped.
Or same reason hundreds of software devs have been stumped by my questions / observations, over decades.
Millions of users post intelligent questions on forums / lists *ALL* the time & no one has an answer.  Means nothing.
It'd be very hard for me & many to *entirely* avoid closed source software.  I try to use open source if at all possible.
I'll try the sniffer - if don't discover something else (soon), or if KIS support doesn't have a solution.  I'm not sure Kaspersky cares about KIS /  TBB issues.
Yes, it seems like a (possible) bug.  Stopping / restarting KIS *shouldn't* have an effect on certificates, whether it is / isn't scanning encrypted connections, etc.
No (visible) settings are changed, by stopping / restarting it. That's why I said it was unusual.

But, in those cases, they're looking for ANY info.  They want DATA from exit nodes, even if they don't think the operator is complicit.  Just as they wanted data from ALL Lavabit customer accts.
If intent is simply to intimidate (as is sometimes the case in other endeavors), then being inefficient matter at all.
When that's the purpose, educating them won't help, either.  That's not ALWAYS their purpose, but LONG history  has shown that it can be.
Some gov'ts, LEAs just don't want Tor & the "bad element" they perceive it brings, operating in their jurisdiction.

Thanks.  Correct.  Knew I should've waited till more awake.

This page gets you there - if you know what to click. The line at top of that page, "description Scripts to build the Tor Browser Bundles" - confusing for users?
Don't remember a link to TBB changes page, on any main Tor / TBB info pages.  May be wrong (happens).
On that page, under "Tags" have to click the TBB version, then "shortlog" or "log."
Info there is useful, but not same format as for Tor, on - - if that's what users are looking for.  Some will have trouble finding concise change logs for TBB.
Shouldn't there be quite visible link(s) for all TBB versions changes / change logs, right on several MAIN pages - main download, main Help, etc?
Here:   - has link to "source code," but none for changes.
Wouldn't that be most logical place for link(s) *directly* to TBB change logs, like most software sites?

Maybe others have direct experience w/ it.  The general problem w/ many extensions, plugins, even clients - is they don't "follow the rules" of staying w/in the Tor network AND not revealing data that may leak your identity / location.
It's a case by case basis, but for Tor, most don't use extensions / plugins - for email - like you're talking.  They're not developed w/ extreme anonymity in mind.  Not that they don't work for general, non anonymous use.
You want what everyone does - ultimate convenience & high anonymity.  They rarely exist together.

Anyone noticed since starting to use Windows - TBB 2.4.x series, it using more CPU when loading pages than it used to?
Even more than regular Fx.  I've noticed this across 2 of the 2.4.x series versions.  Haven't updated to latest - released couple days ago, yet.
TBB 2.4 also seems to load pages considerably slower (over weeks of trial), than earlier versions - WHEN they worked correctly.  I mean, before 2.3.x versions started having so many problems.
It seems to use 25 - 30% CPU, on an Intel quad 2.66 MHz, & uses that much for a long period.  Maybe the length is because it generally takes all pages longer to load in TBB vs. Fx.
Doesn't explain why it'd use so much MORE than regular FX.  It's actually quite a bit more than Fx, percent wise.
On my box, Fx (v 23 - 25) generally only uses in 8 -  12% (sometimes up to 17%) of CPU.  Although, I have no shortage of CPU resources, so that may not be the reason for the significant slowness of 2.4.x versions vs. earlier ones, when they worked "correctly."

No expert, but I'm guessing the problem most have creating a Gmail acct w/o a phone  is not when they:
- already have a google acct (& have cookies from previous session);
- have browser cookies and?, so they'd automatically be logged into a google acct;
- use Chrome.
With all those, there's may be little question in google's mind, who / where / when you are or have been?
Yes, using Tor - you're a "mystery" to them, or at least they can't track you, so probably will ask for a phone.
You probably knew, but others should be aware that using google & expecting anonymity isn't the best idea.

@_subject: [tor-talk] panopticlick data 
There's something quite odd about the EFF / Panopticlick browser fingerprinting site.  All (I) have to do to drastically lower the uniqueness of my browser, is revisit the site several time, clearing cache between visits.
No cookies are set, so that doesn't affect outcome.  In fact, the "bits of identifying information" shown in results chart largely remain identical (except screen size sometimes changes), but their estimate of "One in X browsers have the  same fingerprint as yours," keeps going down dramatically - each time I re run the test.
There's something wrong w/ their "result analysis."  Same browser, showing same bits of identifying data, can't go from uniqueness of 1 in 3 mil, to 1 in 1.7 mil, to 1 in 700 K, to 1 in 500 K, when nothing's changed in the parameters that it is recording to arrive at the analysis.

@_subject: [tor-talk] panopticlick data 
Not sure I understand the question in this context.  Without cookies, I don't expect them to identify repeat visitors.  I read their full paper on how they use the data collected Me visiting 2 - 4 more times, or even the other site visitors - *in the same 2 - 4 min. span*, wouldn't (actually) affect the statistics & lower their reported uniqueness estimate by factors of 2, 3 or more.
Repeating the test 4 times, almost immediately (clearing cache between), out of an existing data base of millions of other site visitors, wouldn't lower my uniqueness from 1 in 1.7 million, then to 1 in 700,000, to 1 in 500,000.
I checked regular Fx again today & my uniqueness just keeps dropping w/ each test.  If I'd kept going, it may have gotten to, "One in 100 browsers have the same fingerprint."
Nothing changed about my browser between "tests," so those huge decreases in my uniqueness would be statistically impossible, unless they had MANY millions of other visitors in the same few minutes I was testing - which they didn't.
Just now (10/1/2013), I checked both TBB 2.3.25-12 (& Firefox 23 - showing it's true useragent info).  Panopticlick showed TBB was over 3 times LESS unique than regular Fx.  TBB:  1 in 689,000 vs Fx 23:  1 in 203,000, at least in one test.  That may not be statistically meaningful, but it's a concern.
Most of the difference came from TBB reported screen size (which showed the correct screen width of my monitor), where Panopticlick shows regular Fx 23 screen width as 256 px LESS than TBB.  Not sure how that's possible for width.
The bigger point is, uniqueness values for either browser keep dropping *dramatically*, repeating the test a few times in just 2 - 3 minutes, when  browser characteristics didn't change.  Making the value of their estimates questionable.  I may contact them to see if they have an explanation for this.
Possible solution to make fingerprinting more difficult:  An extension or TBB design that regularly or randomly changes / spoofs values for some of the data used to "calculate" uniqueness.  There are extensions that change some (like useragent), but don't change it repeatedly.  To avoid tracking Tor users from entry to exit, some browser characteristics would have to change rapidly & often.
I have no idea if the current consensus is that trackers could identify a user from ONE request or a SINGLE entry / exit in the Tor network (making it hard, but not impossible to intentionally change browser characteristics during that short time).  Or... if they'd need to observe several entries / exits (or several requests & receipts involving same relays)  to conclude with high confidence that it is the same browser.

@_subject: [tor-talk] panopticlick data 
Thanks.  I'm not a statistics major, so you may have to explain, but are you saying that the 1st time I visit w/ a given set of browser characteristics, and they've only seen 1:3,444,000 browsers w/ exactly the same traits, then on my 2nd visit, they've now seen 2 identical browsers in 3,444,001  = 1: 1,722,000.5?
All that seems to mean is, they've not seen many browsers like mine (poor distribution), IF... it started out as 1 in 3.44 mil, or anything close - as mine would be a VERY common setup.
All the individual characteristics tested were very common, per their results.  Most are < 1:10 & none > 1:100, except the screen size (which seems incorrect).  Seems unlikely my 1920 width monitor only has 1664 "usable" browser pane width (what they show). When they show *1920* width for TBB, but the 2 browser panes are the same in width.  Only thing taking up horizontal space on either browser is the vertical scroll bar, which are pretty much identical.
*NOTE:*  The *"bits of identifying information"* for individual browser characteristics (useragent, cookies enabled, etc.) & uniqueness (1 in X have this) of the INDIVIDUAL characteristics do NOT change, as you run the test repeatedly.
Those values must be calculated from a set data base & don't seem to be affected by your current visit.
Assuming trackers had a large enough sample space to have a high confidence level, for fingerprinting purposes, would it matter if only 1 in 10,953, or 1 in 10,953,000 browsers were like yours?  As long as they could identify A browser w/ the same uniqueness (EXACT same characteristics - entering & exiting).  Even w/o Flash or Java enabled & revealing system fonts, etc.
Only way I see that's not true is if 100's of users w/ EXACT same browser characteristics (right down to same screen characteristics), used the same entry / exit relays at the SAME time.  That's unlikely, unless TBB starts spoofing screen size, the same for everyone.
I believe in same TBB version (maybe the same in many versions) they spoof the useragent & time zone, but wouldn't differences in screen sizes & color bit ALONE, among a few users on one entry / exit combination, at a given moment be enough to fingerprint one user?

I can't say if that is / isn't true.  If it is, goes back to my question extension, Tor Button) would make it much more difficult to conclusively say, "This is the same person / browser."
Seems unlikely that all TBB users having the exact same browser characteristics is going to happen.  It's good in theory, but may be unrealistic.  Perhaps approaching the issue from a more realistic standpoint is worth looking into?
Chaos is easier to achieve than perfection.  Wondering:  in practice, which would be easier to achieve and / or be more successful at preventing fingerprinting:
Trying to make all TBB users look identical or constantly changing (spoofing) some browser characteristics (ones that DON'T break functionality), so that every TBB browser is "constantly" changing it's Perhaps call it SSTBB - shape shifter TBB.  There may be drawbacks to *regularly* changing ANY characteristics used for fingerprinting.  Just a thought.  Definitely problems w/ the current method of trying to make everyone look identical.
Does the issue of other ways to  find the actual screen size value, apply to other browser traits as well (some / many)?  If so, possibly ONLY turning of java script would prevent much of that. Unfortunately, that breaks at least part of many sites.

Why not randomize certain other data or browser characteristics (that wouldn't break functionality)?  This goes back to my post containing the concept of it being easier to achieve chaos than perfection.
I'm not sure what would / wouldn't surely break some functionality; but things like user agent (or parts of it); time zone; randomly spoofing system fonts, even w/ Flash & Java disabled, etc.  Or other things that are easy to randomize & aren't likely to break functionality.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Adblock for everyone 
Thanks for your insight.
These white lists can easily be disabled, but then that conflicts w/ Tor's concept of damaging sites' acceptance of Tor (interesting point).
However, fingerprinting NOT with standing, millions? of Firefox & other browser users, having Adblock Plus, Ghostery, etc., enabled, are never turned away from websites, AFAIK.
Just curious - by that analogy, should Fx, Chrome & others maybe disallow using extensions that block ads or other things, as it may cause some sites' non acceptance of browsers that allow such extensions?
Could be wrong, but I'd bet if sites "reject" TBB, it might be because of several other reasons that come before blocking ads. But...
That brings up a good question.  I assume that TBB freely gives up info to sites that use the query:  "navigator.plugins" - where sites can query whether specific plugins are installed:
install any plugins.
Since TBB doesn't ship with plugins, why does TBB honor requests for plugin info, at all?
Would TBB ignoring requests for "navigator.plugins" from sites break too many browser functions or ?
As I understand, in Fx there's no equivalent method to find out all installed EXTENSIONS (distinguished from plugins; collectively called "addons").  But presence of SOME extensions are detectable by their effect on a web site's function, such as ads or trackers being blocked.  Correct?  But, not all extensions in Fx (TBB) are detectable - correct?

No comments from more experienced users about the possibility of TBB ignoring sites' requests for *most* plugins?
The word "will" means no exceptions.  Is it true that for extensions (not plugins), how they change TBB's fingerprint (if at all) may depend on their function?  Specifically, their effect, if any, on the web page and if that effect could be detected by the web page (or an adversary)?  And then, only if the extension's (not plugins') specific effect on a web page is actually being monitored?
What site or adversary would or could monitor if an extension was installed, that only shows the download status / progress of a page, etc.?
If an extension doesn't alter sites' functions - at all (not talking about AdBlock here), doesn't send / receive data, no pinging, etc., how would its presence be detected, thus changing TBB's fingerprint?

Yes, the pages are timing out - immediately, repeatedly, spread out dozenS of times over a week.  Also happening on DDG.  I would've used dozens of circuits & new identities.

It could be a Windows  TBB issue, or I could be incredibly unlucky that many dozens of exit relays, all happen to be blacklisted by Ixquick, Startpage & DDG.  Not likely.
Now, CAN'T connect to Google search (most of time; not tried that much), nor Wikipedia.  Connections on all "fail" in 1 or 2 seconds. I CAN connect to all other TBB included search engines.  No problem w/ most other sites.
Just now, it used a U.S. exit, but wouldn't connect (didn't copy the address, but one of MANY dozens over last week or so), .
Since it STARTED happening - suddenly, in WINDOWS TBB 2.3.25-12 - where it worked fine for weeks, haven't connected to Startpage / Ixquick a single time.  It "times out" IMMEDIATELY.

I'm sure Tor developers have considered the real possibility that some or all of what different agencies release, about their capabilities & successes (or lack of) against Tor - or anything else, is misinformation, designed to make the Tor Project AND  users more comfortable in continuing to use TBB.
Logically, if any agency or adversary divulged they can somewhat successfully track users or "infiltrate the system," then most would stop using it and a valuable method to gather information or catch "criminals" would cease to exist.  Good poker players and gov'ts NEVER reveal their hands.
I wouldn't take seriously anything that ANY gov't publicly reveals about their technology or intelligence capability (or lack there or).  Over a long history, it's been repeatedly shown that advanced gov'ts always know more & have more technology capability, than is revealed.  That is, often until decades later, when the real truth comes out.  It's no different now.

I didn't mention ES.  I'm speaking in general terms.  HISTORICALLY, what I said in *general* has proven to be true, time & again. If others think for some reason, it's now going to be different, they're entitled.
I'm speaking of various agencies making statements of how "difficult it is for them" to track / crack / infiltrate the Tor network & other similar topics or propaganda.
Theories?  Denial isn't just a river in Egypt.   There's no theory involved in my statement.  It's simply based on historical facts. It's based on hundreds, if not thousands of years of gov'ts' behaviors,  the world over.  If you want to take the last 75 yrs, there's still more than enough historical documentation that advanced gov'ts always know more & can do more than they let on.  In fact, they'd be insane NOT to do it this way.
All Gov'ts' would be derelict in their duties if in general, they let the public & other states know all their technology & intelligence capabilities.  That is the ONLY point I was making.
Historically (not theoretically), what the public knows at the  time is often the tip of the ice berg.  In reverse, many believe the Holocaust & moon landing were some gov't's scams.
Is it a "conspiracy theory" that many (an undetermined %) of email, internet activity, phone calls, skype, VOIP communications, etc., of persons that aren't suspected of any criminal activity, are being monitored?

@_subject: [tor-talk] still unable to reach StartPage or Ixquick 
I never install TBB over the top of old versions or use an old profile.
Since it's done the same thing (starting > a wk ago in 2.3.25-12), now same exact thing in 2.3.25-13 & 3.0a4.
I can connect to Bing & Yahoo - in any TBB version I'm now trying.
I even have tabs open w/ the URLs already entered for Startpage, Ixquick, Google & say Bing, Yahoo AND any usual site. Google doesn't fail as much, but never had a problem w/ any of them before.
So when Startpage, et al. fail, I instantly load another site (Mozilla.org, etc.) - which succeeds - using the same relay circuit.  I checked w/ the network map open to make sure circuits weren't changing between the failures & successes.
One or 2x wouldn't mean anything, but I've repeated it dozens of times over many days w/ very consistent results.
I also have Firefox open w/ the same site as TBB - say Startpage. When they fail in TBB, I instantly load it in regular Fx & loads every time.  So the search sites' servers aren't overloaded - at least for normal internet traffic.
For a bit, I wondered if my ISP was slowing connections to Tor relays, but I don't  have the TBB connection problem w/ most other sites, so that can't be it.  I'm just brain storming.
Thinking outside the box - what if I look at the problem from opposite direction.  Instead of thinking as a problem of "Startpage, et al. not accepting Tor / TBB," look at it from a "Tor / TBB having problems with these sites" stance (Startpage, et al.).
There's obviously SOME reason, but not typical - given all the methods & versions I've used to rule out possibilities.  Yahoo, Bing, Amazon, Ebay searches - together w/ the nsa, *must* be blocking me from other searches engines, forcing me to use them. Yeah, that must be it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Failed Startpage connection problem found_need 
HOLY CRAP, TOR MAN.  I discovered it's some change (update?) in Kaspersky Internet Security 2014, blocking access to certain sites, like the Tor checkpage, Ixquick, Startpage.  But it doesn't affect vast majority of sites in TBB.
SPECIFICALLY, it seems KIS's "monitoring" of HTTPS port 443 that blocks certain sites using HTTPS, in TBB -ONLY-, NOT in Fx.  Just because it monitors certain ports, (normally) it wouldn't block *EVERYTHING* using those ports, unless there's a "setting" in TBB causing a problem, that's NOT in Fx.  Both have HTTPS everywhere (UNchecking "force HTTPS on Startpage" made no change); both browsers have NoScript.
In regular Fx 24, KIS is still monitoring HTTPS port 443 & Startpage, et al., load just fine.
So it's a *TBB / Tor connection* & port 443 that KIS has a problem with.
Guessing here - seems like a problem w/ TBB "triggering" KIS to block it on port 443.  Fx 24 is NOT blocked on port 443.
I can / will go on the Kaspersky forum on this, but some here may have good solutions.
* Tor / TBB is already in KIS's "Trusted Group," so no problem there.
* Don't (think I) want to turn off ALL port 443 monitoring; causes no problem in Fx & probably should be monitored??
* Don't want to whitelist (not monitor) *ALL*  TBB activity in KIS - takes away all protection.
Must be something specific on -HOW- TBB accesses port 443 VS. regular Fx, that KIS sees as a problem.

OK, thanks.   I never see troubleshooting threads go on forever on the  list. :D
But wait - I found the problem & I'm sure lots of users here know the best, safest way to handle TBB & various AV prgms monitoring port 443.
Not sure need to create a ticket for that.
Perhaps just turn off monitoring encrypted connections in the AV/ soft FW.  Not sure about the safety aspect.
Any AV that does updates, already has your IP address, I'd guess.
I doubt there'd be any way for them to correlate an IP used for updates w/ Tor network addresses, or that it's any concern.
If there is, the whole Tor Project is remiss in not warning users about the threat.
KIS & others log network activity, but you can turn it off completely, or limit retention to a day.
If in a "hostile environment," could clear the log (if turned on) & erase free space on that partition, if worried about the MIB showing up.

Voting w/ your feet / wallet sometimes works, when consumers have choices.
In some locales, there are very few affordable alternatives & ISPs know this, when that's the case.
Another unknown or forgotten fact is, these ISPs & communications co's get paid BIG bucks for their "research & report preparation time," to hand over requested records (logs) of particular individuals.
This is to comply w/ general warrants, nsl's, etc.  The ISP's / mobile communications co's even showed how many requests they got / yr & how much revenue it generated.
An ordinary co. or citizen with "info they were interested in," wouldn't get a dime for gathering & preparing the data to hand over.
In fact, they'd say, "hand it over NOW or we'll throw you in jail & fine I've seen actual invoices from several large communications providers.  They didn't show the targets of requested info, just dates of the requests, how much the gov't was billed, etc.
It apparently was public info (or released, somehow).  You can find these in general searches.  It was astonishing what they charged for such little info.
That may?? be ONE reason (are probably many) that certain "agencies" claimed they needed to ignore the constitution & just listen in w/ their own equip.
Although, it's hard to believe they'd ever recoup the huge capital outlay, for the equip necessary to monitor many millions of users, by not having to pay ISPs' - "research & report preparation fees."
But, they're not paying for it (in any country) - the taxpayers are.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Final report (maybe) on problems connecting to SSL 
For the possible benefit of others, I'm reporting what I finally discovered.  It's a strange one.
I reported I'd finally narrowed it to some change (update?) in Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 (KIS), seemed to block access to certain sites in TBB, like the Tor checkpage, Ixquick, Startpage.
All appeared to be using HTTPS port 443.  I think it affected ANY site in TBB using port 443.  But didn't seem to affect regular Fx 23 / 24 on port 443.
* Seems * port 443 was treated differently in TBB VS. Fx.  Don't know whose "fault" it was.
BEFORE the KIS "fix," on the Tor network map, I watched port 443 open, then immediately close, each time an SSL connection was initiated.
The "solution" involved TOGGLING settings in KIS for scanning (or not) encrypted / SSL ports.  Then closing KIS completely & restarting.
Then changing "Scan encrypted connections" settings BACK to original defaults, closing & restarting KIS (again).
In the end, I wound up w/ the EXACT KIS 2014 settings (for this area), as the original defaults.  It's just that THESE original default settings broke TBB, when using port 443.
Other than KIS settings actually stored were different than the GUI showed, have no explanation.  Hope I don't have to repeat this type process anytime soon.

@_subject: [tor-talk] fingerprinting implications_changing TBB font or font 
I'm not a national whistle blower or spy (for now - gov't shut down), but I'm interested in the implication of changing font or size in TBB, in Options > Fonts & Colors > Advanced.
The default in my language package is Times New Roman.  The default (serif) size for that font (16?), plus NO "minimum font size," is too small on many pages to read, w/o using Ctrl + mouse scroll, or something One named font at "size 16" can vary a lot in displayed size, from another font - at same stated size.
I'm not sure if named font & size used in TBB is "faked," or if sites can query the browser for it?  If they can, changing them would likely make me more unique than those using default font settings.
There are extensions that change browser font size, but those may be detectable as well??
A quick test on Panopticlick showed when I used Ctrl + scroll to zoom the screen, it DID change their perceived screen size (a lot) - to 11nn x 5nn. Default reported by TBB is 1920 x 970?
Changing the TBB font SIZES in Options didn't change Panopticlick's perceived screen size - but that's THEIR TEST.  Doesn't mean other sites couldn't detect the changesVS. other Tor browsers.
Anyone have knowledge of real data on this?

You can encrypt your more private messages, or attach encrypted files.
Yahoo may still let you create an acct w/ TBB.  In the US, you may have to use a US exit relay & may have to use one each time you log in - or face the security questions, or complete login denial. Not the best, but...

Thanks for the info.  As always (& as Bitmessage site points out), if you send unencrypted email outside to "regular" email servers, sensitive or personal info faces exposure & scanning by the receiving server.
You can encrypt messages, but that's still not accepted by average users.
I'm guessing that using Bitmessage w/ Tor, that perhaps the receiving server or the recipient, can't determine the sender's actual IP address?
Has there been much of a problem w/ other email providers rejecting messages from Bitmessage servers?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Using non U.S. email providers_ allows 'legal' data 
The reference to risup.net in Tor Weekly News isn't in context for this, but raises a question.
I've not read a lot on the 'LEAs' gathering data - even email address books? (assume getting them from web mail?), but several articles I did read indicated one of the ways "LEAs" got around U.S. illegalities of spying on citizens that weren't under suspect, is "grab" data from servers OUTSIDE the U.S.
DON'T know how large a % of all data gathered is by this method - servers outside U.S.
If the articles are accurate, if worried about snooping, is it smarter / dumber / makes no difference, to use one of the many "more private / secure" providers, often located outside the U.S. (like Riseup.net), or just use one in the U.S.?
Of course, the shut down of Lavabit because of demand for access to all users' accounts doesn't instill confidence in having a U.S. based acct., but there was one user among them on the "(Top) most wanted list."  They wanted to make sure no stone was unturned.
1) Articles indicated LEAs could 'legally' capture data when mail is sent from U.S. to foreign recipient / server (the LEAs aren't limited by laws / constitution in other countries, or don't care).
2) Could capture data if U.S. citizens had email accts in foreign countries.
3) Could capture data originating in the U.S., routed though foreign servers, before final delivery to another U.S. server.
4) Could capture data originating from foreign servers, destined for U.S. servers.
Or... it may not matter what you do, or where, if not encrypting your email?

I read the paper - good job. Some of it will be over the heads of some, but that's unavoidable unless make it 10+ pages, in newbie language, then few would read it all, so...
I'm not bashing Tor here, so leave your pitchforks in the barn. Just asking questions, making observations that may / may not have an answer or even be useful.
One thing jumps out, Tor doesn't know for sure who's running Guard or exit nodes - & can't unless they start doing (regular, repeated) extensive personal interviews, background checks, giving polygraph tests, injecting sodium pentathol  to those wanting to run nodes.  I guess more so for Guards.
Since apparently now LEAs from (some) countries are teaming up, sharing info, etc., seems possible the problem of LEAs (or any adversaries) running a higher % of nodes could get worse, not better.  If adversary nodes as a % of all nodes doesn't increase (new good guy nodes keeps up w/ increase of adversarial ones), then overall risk hasn't changed.  But how can Tor (or any group) determine the risk if they have no reasonably reliable way to determine the REAL intention / identity of node operators (spies infiltrating Tor Network)?
Governments, crooks have proven themselves VERY resourceful over decades, or 100's of yrs.  The U.S., let alone other industrialized nations partnering together, has a lot more manpower, resources & money than Tor Project.  I don't think we can out spend "them," for setting up nodes.  How many full / part time programmers or "idea people" does Tor have (as good as they are) VS. one agency of one industrialized nation?
Is there any way - in the future, that Tor could run a much larger % of nodes or at least, instead of constantly trying to figure how to "beat / drastically improve the odds" that an adversary won't accidentally control the entry / exit nodes on circuits?  Perhaps a noble, but losing game, if gov'ts band together & decide Tor, or the entire internet, IS worth serious monitoring.  Perhaps reasonable anonymity on a world wide party line is too ambitious? (Those that don't know what a "telephone party line" was, can "Startpage it."  [stop saying "Google it"] :)
What about somehow getting a better handle on who actually runs the nodes?  With its current policies & design, Tor is in a very tough position to "ensure quality" (anonymity).  Tor isn't supposed to see any real data on the network - for one, so they can't be forced to give anything up (again, noble), but that prevents some (a lot of?) capability for quality control.  No company would / could handle its own security that way.  It's a Catch 22 situation for Tor, because of legal threats that many gov'ts impose, that many corporations don't face.  And if they had some REALLY secret stuff to send abroad, they'd fly it in their own jet.
What about a COMPLETELY different approach, rather than trying to develop methods to "beat the odds," *ad infinitum,* against what COULD become an ever increasingly larger PERCENTAGE of gov't / adversary run nodes?  Surely, it'd be worthwhile to look way down the road & see where Gov'ts / LEAs may be going w/ this & whether they can be "bested," by following the same course that Tor is on (even with improvements along the way)?  I have no idea - I'm just saying, sometimes the only way businesses, technologies, gov'ts survive & thrive is to completely change course.   For all of history, gov'ts have gone to GREAT lengths to spy on citizens & adversaries & have often done pretty well at it.
Well liked corporations can often be as secretive as they want - they're "protecting corporate data & assets."  Tor is looked at in part (*by gov'ts & LEAs*), as a tool for terrorists, criminals - of all sorts.  They couldn't care less if honest people, whistle blowers swim near schools of criminals & terrorists, whether some will get caught in the same net.  Maybe, like Corporations that get away w/ figurative murder, Tor Project should start contributing heavily to key political figures, to ensure they'll "be left alone?"  :D
You laugh, but that's exactly why big business, who by current STATUTES, break JUST AS MANY OR MORE laws, as Gov'ts / LEAs *ASSUME* that Tor users do?   Big Business is left alone & entities like Tor are on the hit list.

I'm not knocking Finland.  I know nothing of their privacy / citizens' rights laws.  Even if "A / The / Another Country" has the BEST internet user, or any other privacy, citizens' rights laws in the WORLD, it doesn't mean all (or any) OTHER countries respect their laws.  It doesn't mean other countries' LEAs aren't sniffing all the communications they can, that passes through those great countries (possibly even their "allies").
It doesn't mean some advanced countries don't have the ability to sniff communications.  Maybe none, a little or a lot - who knows? Maybe someone will leak some documents that sheds light on those activities.
IIRC, there are a number of countries "upset" right now, by indications of LEAs from another country(ies) doing communications data gathering in their country.  Brazil - one that is upset.  And others.
If you're a citizen of Finland or a super privacy conscious land, that's great.  If you live in a country w/ not so good privacy laws (or ones that aren't enforced), & are just using internet / email service in those great lands, your info might not be a private / protected as you (anyone) thought.  From a privacy standpoint, it may? be somewhat better to use email servers somewhere like Finland, but it now seems apparent that it doesn't put you completely out of the "long arm of the law" of your own country.  Depending on where you live.
AFAIK, it's not illegal in most countries for its OWN agencies to spy on (in), gather data in other countries, in any manner they can possibly dream up.  Quite the opposite.  Which is what many countries do to each other - now, 365 days / yr.

May be mistaken, but I thought the 1st pref below (included in TBB by default) was to bring back the old Fx 3.x, "clear private data" prefs, much like using the extension, "AskForSanitize" does.
These are default values in TBB (I think):
user_pref("privacy.sanitize.migrateFx3Prefs", true);
user_pref("privacy.sanitize.sanitizeOnShutdown", true);
I believe the 2nd pref automatically clears any private data.
Thought the pref BELOW was so Fx / TBB would SHOW the prompt, to clear private data when close TBB / Fx?  No?  If so, adding it to TBB prefs doesn't cause it to show the prompt to show on closing TBB.
user_pref("privacy.sanitize.promptOnSanitize", true);
If allow some site an exception to make it work (& trust the site), I'd still like to SEE the prompt to clear data.
MOST times in TBB, there will be no private data to clear.    Maybe this is a non issue for most & maybe it's by TBB design not to show the prompt.  Or maybe TBB doesn't show it because modern Fx doesn't show it?

I read the paper -  slept since then.
Would someone please clarify this general statement & that part of the design concept?
The statement in  is a bit confusing.
they want to do something often without an attacker noticing, and the attacker noticing once is as bad as the attacker noticing more often."/
How is being "noticed" once, perhaps for 15 seconds,  visiting one website - that yields very little info, better than being noticed many times, over a long period?
Is it that once an adversary correlates your machine (fingerprint) w/ an originating IP & a Tor entry / exit, they could theoretically ID you?
If so, doesn't that beg the question of why does TBB keep the same browser fingerprint from entry to exit?
Why (have or allow TBB to) keep the same fingerprint over long periods, even if some of that data is spoofed, rather than TBB randomly change (spoof) the fingerprint, from end to end on one circuit and / or over time?
One big problem as I understand, is a Tor user (specific browser on specific machine) is potentially identifiable from entry to exit, by having the same fingerprint.
Why not change the fingerprint?  Put on a "hat & glasses" or "different colored coat" part way through the circuit?  TBB already spoofs SOME browser data - it just remains constant.  Maybe other tracking issues completely over shadow this.
Even if having TBB change fingerprints along a circuit and / or at other times doesn't solve all problems, could it be a *part* of reducing fingerprinting and / or tracking?

Thanks.  I moved your top post to underneath my post.
Request header is only one of many things that would (may?) make up browser fingerprints (IIRC).  Many other data could be changed. Whether they could be changed in transit on one circuit & if it would be *any* benefit, is the question.  I'm not talking about changing browser fingerprint data that would "mess up" the returned content (for mobile device, etc.).  Maybe this isn't possible, but worth asking.
IF... the request header can NOT be changed, or requested & returned data won't work AND if the request header *alone* is enough for very sophisticated adversaries to track users end to end, then all bets may be off.
If request header is all adversaries need, then the constant talk of (more) unique,"/ is pointless.  So, I assume that request headers aren't everything, for tracking / fingerprinting.
If TBB users allow 3rd party cookies (& some other actions), they probably have other concerns & fingerprinting may be a moot point for them.  One assumes there's a certain point that preventing TBB users from shooting themselves in the foot is impossible.

Thanks for the details.  Of course you're correct about being noticed once, posting or d/l _certain data_ from certain sites (being watched).  Question - for average users in "free" societies, if you're "noticed" once visiting a  site like wikileaks (legal in most countries) by a formidable adversary (just visit - not post, download, etc.), & they reasonably confirmed the entry traffic & exit traffic are the same  (volume & timing), the assumption is they put all visitors on a watch list?
I'm asking - for everyone that mistypes, is curious about a news story or chooses the wrong URL address (Tor & non Tor users), they'll then gather all data for all accounts, of any type, of those people from then If they saw the IP address you came from to the entry node & you did something they were *really* interested in AND had the authority, I guess they could "request" from your ISP, who used that address on that date & time.
That is of utmost concern if you're Assange or Snowden; such use is the primary concern of Tor Project.
For avg users, is it a huge concern (unless things change a lot - & they Probably 99+ % of Tor users don't post on wikileaks or release stolen, classified documents.  For those that do, I'd guess they really should use something with / in addition to TBB (or instead of;  their own strong encryption, carrier pigeon).
I hope if you're in life or freedom threatening use of Tor (with its current limitations / weaknesses), that you *don't* access the network straight from your main, commercial ISP.
Even for a one time whistle blower of a small co., is it likely someone would 1) be watching the exact entry / exits you used, AND 2) have the authority to track you down and care enough to do so?
Do most gov'ts care about reporting sexual harassment at Bob's Broom Factory or who wishes to remain anonymous when data searching on male I don't grossly :) misunderstand how Tor network works, though I'm no expert, like most users.

I assume the color depth is bit value.  Panopticlick shows 24 (bit?), but there's not even a CHOICE of 24 bit in my display settings, for my monitor / graphics card combination.  Maybe I misunderstand how Panopticlick arrives at that value.
It surprised me that it estimated 1 in 76 browsers had the USERAGENT data given by TBB, of Windows 7 w/ Fx 17.  Other than possibly mostly TBB users going to Panopticlick (skewing the data) to check browser uniqueness, I doubt 1 in every 76 users in the U.S. or world wide, truly have Fx 17 in Windows 7.  Maybe I'm wrong.
I just wondered if others have checked their regular Firefox & TBB uniqueness on eff's site, to see if the data shown seems accurate for their system?

If the number of sites potentially affected is as large as indicated on heartbleed.com, changing PW on even 60% of sites I use could take a long time - even to do it once.
It would do little good to change a password on a site that hasn't patched this.
Or perhaps it would do some good, to change the password before logging out of a site?  Then when a site must be accessed again, change the password again.

Indicating to many users, it will download & automatically install an update over the top of existing version, as regular Fx does?
True, that takes one to the bundle download page (vs. automatically starting an upgrade process), which may further confuse users.
Also, if a recent TorBrowser version exists, when the installer runs, if an installation path w/ a previous version present, should the installers really be saying,
"The destination directory already exists.  You can try ot upgrade Tor Browser, but if you run into any problems, use a new directory instead." ?
That clearly sends the msg that upgrading over the top can be done. If that should not ever be done under any circumstances, the installer probably shouldn't allow it.
For TorBrowser, the phrase "installed" is used, but it's not technically installed, according to Windows definition.

Well, one website sorta has.  They seem to have more extensive testing for overall security procedures, not just the heartbleed bug.
They give a rating for sites in areas like
- following best practices for server security (based on their own published guide)
- heartbleed vulnerability
- type ciphers used
- whether they use forward secrecy
They list a few of most recent sites tested, under several categories; certainly not extensive.
It would be interesting to see how long it took sites to fix this issue, but wouldn't the process have needed to start very early after it was I too think avg consumers could benefit from seeing websites "safety ratings," but that's a moving target.  Seems it'd need updating constantly.  Which I guess could be done.
Using SSLlabs.com & some others to confirm findings, I was quickly able to determine that most banks - large & small - already installed the openSSL patch, much earlier on Tues. - possibly on Mon.
Where this smaller bank w/ a fair number of regional branches that I use, still had not upgraded OpenSSL as of midday on Wed 4/9.
The manager / VP in charge of their computer operations didn't reply to my email informing him of the continued problem, until... I sent a follow up to the bank COO, that the problem was still unresolved as of 4/9/14.  Funny how that works.
The followup reminding them both that they were putting themselves & customers at risk; from being so slow to implement the patch compared to comparable businesses, from not warning customers of the issue & by not stopping customers from logging in (potentially exposing passwords & critical data), until sufficient fixes were in place.
This may be a good thing to find out general practices.  They've been slow about past, immediate security issues, which I brought to their attention & they never said, "Sorry," "Get bent," or anything.
Only made excuses for being out of the office.  This could be the final straw for me using them for primary online banking.

Some providers might not allow access at all, if using exit relays in *specific* countries.
Sometimes providers will present captchas or ask you to answer your security question, if the exit relay is different than when creating the acct.  Sometimes, it just seems to fail.

In short term, email links can be R clicked, copied, then pasted into TBB (or browser of choice).
That's pretty good advice, no matter the browser.
The larger point being, links can be / are spoofed all the time to have almost identical spelling as the "real" site and the site they link to can be a clone of the real site (my bank, etc.).
One thing that's constantly warned against, is just clicking email links & opening in a browser w/o even looking at the name / spelling of the URL entered in the browser.
Aside from links in email being spoofed, other issues / concerns over opening email links has been discussed here before.
One of those issues was, for a small number of "specially crafted" email links, they can be crafted to open in Tbird (rather than the default browser - IF just clicked, not R-clicked).
"Normally," links don't open in Tbird.

Re:  dealing with blacklisted Tor IP addresses:
To all those replying, I should have said, who deals w/ blacklisted Tor addresses that were blocked simply because spam or malicious activity came from those addresses?
That is, when there's no intent by websites to block Tor, per se. They're just addresses that spammers used, which happen to be Tor IPa's.
In that context, they're no different than any other site or email address that gets blacklisted.
When that is the case, explaining to someone that "it's just a Tor address" won't matter, because that may not be why it was blocked.
It's just one more IPa that was abused, then placed on a blacklist(s).  In many cases, they weren't blocked *because* they were Tor addresses.
But in all cases, someone must appeal to the blacklists (or site, organization) to remove the address from blacklists or unblock it.
When IPa's from email providers get abused, and when mail you send that happens to use that same IPa gets rejected, it's usually up to the email provider to get the IPa(s) off the blacklists.
I don't know there's anyone responsible for doing this for blocked Tor

It doesn't sound right to me, but I'm no expert on newer TBB versions.  I'm (sort of) seeing same thing as you.
In my v3.5.1, if I change from default "never remember history" to "use custom history" then check something else - like "remember my browsing & download history,"
it prompts for restart - like you said.
After it restarts & I change back to "never remember history" & check "always use private browsing," it retains those settings until I close Options, then reopen it (no messages, doesn't complain).
After reopening Options again, it's set on "use custom settings for history."  But "always use private browsing" is still checked & NOTHING else on that screen.
After that, in Torbutton > Security tab, the 3rd option -"restrict 3rd party cookies & other tracking data," is NOT checked.
It probably should be.  AND when then look in about:config (while Options still show "always use private browsing" - checked, & "accept cookies" - UNchecked),
then about:config shows:   "extensions.torbutton.restrict_thirdparty = false.  Obviously, it should be True.
Other than checking some sites & looking at the cookies file (using an editor) to see if it is / isn't allowing any cookies - of any type, we have no way of knowing if this is just a UI bug, or if settings really get messed up internally.

As someone mentioned, seems in order to "convince" some sites to stop denying Tor, some TBB users and / or Tor Project personnel need at least *some* supporting data.  Hopefully showing that the number of abusers on given sites aren't disproportionately coming through Tor.  Might be a 1st step?
If data doesn't back that up (where would typical users *get* such data?), then the sites blocking Tor could have a point (regarding their OWN site).
How do we know if the blocking sites are / aren't getting lots of abuse via Tor (or at least think they are), OR... if that's *just an excuse.*
An excuse because TBB users can't be fingerprinted the same nor have the same amt of data extracted, as normal browsers.
After all, some sites (what % ?) are reportedly selling their users' email addresses, other data - to companies building user profiles; which in turn sell the profiles for advertising or possibly "other" purposes (NS*, etc.).
Even combining *real names & addresses w/ email addresses,* along w/ profiled personal interests, buying habits; interests in politics, religion - & so on.
So it wouldn't be surprising for some sites to use "we get abuse through Tor" as an excuse to block it.  Theoretically, they'd be losing money by not having as much data to sell.
TWO of many detailed article on this practice, that seems to be gaining "Race Is On to 'Fingerprint' Phones, PCs" -  "RapLeaf Inc. Profiles Users by Name" - I also remember a time when a fairly large # of sites refused access, unless you accepted cookies.  That practice was eventually relaxed.
Maybe? in part, because other ways were developed to gather data from visitors (beacons, etc.) and /or get money from 3rd parties, without needing cookies?

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB 3.5 starts w/ size buttons hidden 
TBB 3.5 for Win is starting in half screen & the UI sizing buttons are hidden because the TBB UI is shifted where the size buttons are off the So is most of the title bar, making it hard to drag the UI down to reach buttons.  Once maximized, it fits fine on the monitor.
Finally got it pulled down so could maximize TBB, then closed it. Thinking it'd reopen maximized.  On reopening, same thing - the UI size buttons are hidden off top of monitor.
This is the 1st TBB version I've seen this problem.  Not a problem w/ any other apps.

>"You can use the windows key + an arrow key to resize and move windows."
DOESN'T work on my machine in Vista x64 (for any app).  No effect. Maybe some Windows option turned off?
Thanks.  Good point.  Starting in reduced size isn't the issue - hidden title bar is.  Starting w/ the title bar & buttons hidden on a common 1920x1080 native (21.5 in.) monitor is odd.  Nothing unusual about the monitor & no issue w/ other apps.  I'd think many would complain about TBB 3.5 if it's widespread.  This began *ONLY* in TBB 3.5 - 1st launch & has persisted (erratically). Checked this again in TBB 2.4.17 & no issue w/ opening size or position.
Further "testing" - TBB 3.5 opening UI alignment is erratic. Sometimes after maximizing, then closing - it reopens w/ title bar aligned - but often NOT.
* Title bar being hidden on TBB start happens most often when I maximize its UI, then minimize, then close.  That seems the MOST common scenario, when title bar's completely hidden on restart.  But NOT ONLY time.
Not using any extensions, plugins - except default.  Tried it enough to see, even w/ no other changes between restarts, proper title bar alignment is erratic.
* If title bar IS aligned, TBB sometimes starts w/ bottom border hidden well below the Windows task bar (I've only 1 task bar row & "small" icons).  Not a huge issue, as I can then maximize UI - but still odd.
Tested a bunch of apps & Firefox - none have these issues.
Further, I've (always) had checked -  "keep *task bar* on top," but NOT "locked" or "auto hide."  No changes on task bar properties in ages.
* With TBB 3.5 started in part-screen mode & with (if) its bottom border hidden (that actually aligns w/ monitor's bottom IF... I hide task bar), when I hide, then UNhide task bar, TBB instantly adjusts its bottom border to just touch the task bar  - for that session.  But doesn't always remember ANY positions / alignment on next restart.  When I think I've figured out sequence, it surprises me again.
* Sometimes, if click maximize UI button, then reduce, it'll immediately change UI position, so all but ~ the LOWER 1/4 of resizing buttons are hidden off the monitor.  Sometimes NOT.  But doing that, buttons *may* display OK.
* Still common for TBB 3.5 to start w/ title bar completely off monitor.  If so, only way I've found to maximize TBB UI is IF... the bottom border is showing above task bar, drag it UP a bit, then PART of title bar instantly displays (showing small part of buttons). Then click maximize button.
(Why would dragging TBB's bottom border make the title bar SUDDENLY jump Whatever my Windows / display "settings" are, haven't changed & work OK w/ other apps & previous TBB versions.
That's why I asked -  so not to file a bug if I'm the only one. Other than bug / Vista incompatibility, can't imagine why ONLY TBB 3.5 would do this.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB 3.5 starts w/ size buttons hidden 
Read the bug & comments.  On mine, the title bar isn't missing - it's hidden (menu bar isn't checked to be displayed, by default) .
Hard to tell from the bug report attached screen, if their title and / or menu bar is missing or just hidden.  On mine, UI display - sometimes - stops in middle of tabs, showing it's not hidden or cut off JUST at their border.
As I said, if / when it's hidden AND if TBB bottom border is visible / draggable, moving bottom border up an inch or so, causes UI to change size and / or re-position, so title bar & sizing buttons are at least partially visible.
So, doesn't seem truly "missing."  Neither does part of the bottom of UI (border) seem "missing" - on start up, when bottom border *sometimes* appears cut off.
When bottom border is NOT visible, if I hide task bar, the bottom UI border "seems" aligned w/ monitor's bottom.  "Seems aligned" - because don't know if it was ALREADY aligned (w/ monitor bottom, but hidden by task bar), or if hiding task bar causes TBB UI to *then change size / position,* just as  when title bar is hidden & dragging the bottom border UP, causes the UI to *re-position* - revealing *part* of title bar & buttons.
Just tested again w/ *menu bar displayed.*  Still started w/ title bar & sizing buttons *ALMOST* hidden ("title bar" - just above menu bar).  In that scenario, "almost" hidden because can see only the *bottom, black border* of the sizing buttons.  BARELY enough to click & re-size UI (sometimes).  Again, if drag the bottom border UP ~ an inch, more of the sizing buttons (but not all) become visible.
With menu bar turned off, AND if / when it starts w/ title bar hidden, *(often) none* of sizing buttons is initially visible. Until I drag bottom border up, then the top of UI shifts down about 1/4 inch.
Other times, just enough of buttons are visible to click.  Erratic. I've identified at least 3 - 4 sequences / steps, when title bar (and / or menu) MAY be partially or totally hidden.  But not 100% for any scenario, AFAIK.
Title bar & size buttons being hidden on startup is ERRATIC, but happens *probably 50% of startups.*  Most often happens if I maximize UI, then reduce again, close TBB & restart (reduce UI, not minimize to task bar).
But, not 100% reproducible.  Sometimes, UI opens (in partial screen) w/ title bar & buttons fully displayed.  Next restart (immediately, w/o accessing any pages), title bar & buttons may be hidden again - *w/ OR W/O touching anything except close button.*
Since this doesn't happen w/ any other TBB versions before 3.5, AND doesn't happen w/ any apps, seems the problem began w/ some v3.5 change.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB font size concern for many users 
People having excellent sight naturally don't think about reading small print books or web pages.
But a lot of the general population has a problem with this.
Because of possible browser fingerprinting issues & / or anonymity leaks, TBB users are discouraged from
- changing default settings in TBB (like font name or the Default Font size / minimum size).
- using addons / extensions - (here, to enlarge fonts) that might compromise anonymity.
Points taken.  Where does that leave users NEEDING larger than default  My guess - people w/ these problems just change fonts / sizes by various means, unaware of implications, or just no other choice.
For instance, using default font settings - TBB 3.5 - English, Windows - apparent font size on  is approx. equivalent to 9 pt (I think).
Even w/ Windows DPI increased to 110 vs. default 96.  For many, the equivalent of 9 pt is pretty small - even for a book.
Some pages use *very* small or hard to read font, if users keep the default TBB setting, "allow pages to use their own fonts...."
For some, the default font STYLE - Times New Roman - (in TBB - English), may be less readable than others.
Fonts other than Times New Roman are often recommended for better general readability & for sight or other "reading problems."
Other reading problems exist besides eyesight / small font; I don't have them, but they exist.
This general issue is problematic for many non-Tor users & overcoming it is a *technical* issue; in TBB, it involves anonymity - even security / freedom (get caught using Tor in the wrong place, for instance).
What are the *recommended* options for users w/ these issues, that won't increase browser uniqueness or possibly compromise anonymity?
For web sites (or others) looking at font style / sizes in TBB, what effect does using the keyboard & mouse to increase font size (e.g., Ctrl + scroll)  have on fingerprinting?
Using THAT or similar method, can they still see the font size is different than default?
Just a question - I don't have a perfect answer:  what if default font size was increased (some) - or *possibly* other changes - would it put hardship on normally sighted users?  Would it cause them equivalent problems that small or harder to read font causes users w/ sight or reading problems?
If changing default font or size, by ANY known method may still cause concern, then developing an extension that plays nice w/ TBB isn't the

Playing devil's advocate - is it a good or not so good idea for users
1) not to be able to see their current (exit) node?  For Tor users in certain countries, would it be the best choice to use nodes located in their own countries or in ones suspected of being "cooperative" with their countries?  Or nodes in specific other countries, depending on your country & its working relationship with those other countries?
Or is using exit nodes in your own country or in countries that regularly trade info with your country (many countries do), not considered an issue - at all?
2) not to know the result of a new identity?  Given 1) - (can't see nodes)..., then 2) seems a moot point.

Like certain mobile providers were geographically tracking some users. That way, if you get lost, just call your mobile provider's CS & say, "Where am I?"
Or, is it Google saying to Mozilla, "If you want the $ we pay you (for making Google the default search engine), then we need to be able to physically track Fx users.  So, make it happen."
Or, maybe it's a 3 letter agency telling Mozilla & Google to add ability in their browsers / searches, to physically track users?

 >Can sites determine the (selected) browser font name & size & thus,  >changes from default setting?
 >For fingerprinting?
Using  - without Flash or Java enabled, they apparently can't see any font list or size selected, in
TBB or Fx.
Nor do they indicate an ability (at all) to detect the font styles / sizes selected in either browser's options.
Am I correct, that sites can't detect changes from default _TBB settings for font NAME, size & "minimum font size_", found under Options > Content?
browserspy.dk DOES reflect a change in *screen width & height* ("Resolution") *when screen is enlarged (zoomed) using Ctrl + mouse scroll.*
That may / may not be very useful for fingerprinting?
For me, their reported screen width & height is incorrect - both @ 100% zoom AND w/ zoom increased.
That could be because the detected DPI is *also incorrect.*  They show: "DPI detected via JavaScript = 96x96, when it's actually 110 DPI.
Is it known that sites CAN detect selected TBB *browser* font names & sizes?  And perhaps other browser test sites would show that.
If not, it appears that changing font name & size under Options > Content to increase small text, provides LESS browser characteristics than using Ctrl + mouse scroll to zoom screen size.

Thanks for the link.  I've read the design document before, but good to review.  I read what little browserspy.dk had about fonts.  I've also read most of what EFF has on Panopticlick site, about everything.  Several times. Didn't see the topic / statement on Panopticlick's site, referenced in Tor's design document > fingerprinting-linkability - about "enumerable list in filesystem order..." :
 My question is NOT about sites querying which fonts are installed on my system (their "existence").
The design document talks about measures taken  to limit font info that sites might get (quote below).  But, either I don't understand some details in the document (likely), or it doesn't address my actual Which is, _can sites can detect the actual fonts & font sizes, *currently used by* the browser._
If they CAN, & I *change TBB's default font NAME and / or SIZES * (in Options > Content), then I'd be "different" from many TBB users.
I've looked for the answer for several years.  I've never seen *that question* / issue discussed - anywhere.  If someone has seen it discussed, please point it out.
That's assuming the setting is UNchecked:  "Allow pages to use their own fonts."  If I allow using their own fonts, some text on some pages will still be very small / difficult to read.
As I determined, zooming pages with Ctrl + mouse scroll, DOES change the reported screen size on Panopticlick & Browserspy.dk - even in TBB.
Disregarding Flash & Java (disabled or not installed), every thing I've seen about sites getting font info (as I understand), discusses them querying which fonts are on your system  - NOT the actual fonts & font sizes *currently used by* the browser.

Again, no discussion of sites detecting TBB's currently selected fonts &

Except, comparing apples to apples, what typical Tor operators do is no different than what ISPs do.
Comparing handing out weapons to passing internet traffic through servers - while having no knowledge of its content, is an apples to oranges comparison.
Except that Tor operators (or any others like them) are "little guys" that a lot of LEAs don't like.
To be fair in applying the law, Austrian courts would *have to convict* the Austrian equivalent of say, AT&T (ISP), if they were EVER found to have unknowingly transmitted illegal material through their servers.
Of course every huge ISP has transmitted illegal / stolen material, or plans to commit crimes through their servers - but not w/ their knowledge or blessing.
I've never heard of a single ISP being indicted, much less convicted over a case like this.

Unless your "conviction" or settlement (what ever the legal term in Austria)  for this situation is unusual in the Austrian legal system, the fact of it not showing up on your permanent record, so it won't affect getting work in the future, etc., is QUITE different than in the U.S., for similar "crimes convictions."  Of course, every legal matter & decision is different.
Perhaps it was part of the probation that if you behave, it will be expunged (removed) from your record?
But for *adults* convicted of crimes (certainly ANY thing to do w/ child porn or abuse), it would remain on your record until death.
Sorry, I couldn't load the linked page for "official statement part 1, so didn't get the exact crime they eventually convicted you of.
Maybe your conviction wasn't "child prOn trafficking, but if convicted of the *least* possible crime involving that (or sexual abuse of a minor) in the U.S., it probably will remain on your record.
Unless due to circumstances, a U.S. judge feels your record should be expunged, once probation is fulfilled.  If the law even gives a judge that leeway, for a specific crime.

Playing Devils' Advocate:  If Austria's laws are so protective of ISPs in general, why was this gentleman convicted?
Unless he ignored the advice I've seen so many times, not to commingle your own internet traffic w/ the Tor relay traffic.
Even then, I wonder about a conviction, unless he had the worst lawyer in the world (which he may have).
There also could be other info which wasn't divulged.  I'm not saying there is - just could be.
Unless there was a REALLY bad ruling, in which case an appeal might have a good chance? of over turning it.
But I know nothing of Austrian law.
However, it seems strange that if he only was running a server & neither he / a roommate / house guest did anything illegal on a computer, using the same relay, how it ever got to a conviction.
If he nor anyone using the physical computer running the relay did nothing illegal, and he was still convicted (not just questioned or charged), that would seem to spell doom to other operators.
If that's what can happen, people should think twice & a 3rd time before ever risk running one.

Definitely!  /"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."/ - Ben Perhaps out of fear of legal liability, Tor Project doesn't seem to have what would be very helpful for relay operators - guides, documents - even access to basic legal advice,  of how to best avoid legal issues to begin with.
I know nothing of legalities surrounding that, but people starting a relay w/o proper guidance on how to avoid legal problems as much as possible, *doesn't quite seem right.*
In a worst case scenario, running relays can be truly *life destroying.*  It seems volunteers need better preparation & education about potential ramifications.  If after being educated, they still choose to run relays (especially exit), that's fine.
However, it would seem wrong to not make reasonably complete education materials available to potential relay operators, to prepare them & warn them of potential downside.
Without relay operators, there won't be much left (unless independent volunteers no longer handle that function).
Accused persons dealing w/ problems like this after the fact, is far, far worse than even an extraordinary amount of time spent on preventing If LEAs / judicial system actively investigates someone (throwing around terms like child porn), or indicts a person, the mental stress alone is enough to ruin one's life.

Holy... "they may not have a clue what danger lies ahead," Batman.
We're going to have to agree to disagree, that at least some basic info on potential dangers be supplied, if only links.
We've all seen several people conversing on tor-talk now, that were run through the ringer, for running Tor relays.
I don't think any of them thought they'd be fighting for their freedom; spending a huge part of savings to defend themselves or going through extended, true mental anguish of wondering if they'd lose their freedom & family.
Maybe Tor Project itself isn't the one that should be doing the educating in this case - dunno.
Though I don't like the thought of people going through hell on Earth, because they didn't understand the dangers, I also understand it's not in Tor Project's best interest to scare off relay operators.
One issue is, every Tor user is encouraged to run a relay.  Kind of like the US Army commercials promoting adventure & visiting foreign lands, instead of bullets & grenades coming at you.
I'm not sure if the 1st FAQ at the link portrays an accurate picture of potential dangers:
       >"Has anyone ever been sued or prosecuted for running Tor?"
*>"No*, we aren't aware of anyone being sued or prosecuted in the United States just for running a Tor relay. Further, we believe that running a Tor relay --- including an exit relay that allows people to anonymously send and >receive traffic --- is legal under U.S. law."
That may need a bit of revision. :D  Maybe no one has been prosecuted in the US (I don't know), but people in other countries sure have.
And being investigated or going through court hearings & trials - maybe for months or yrs, can destroy a person.
It can be devastating, even if you're never formally charged.
Many people who've never gone through something like that can't fully understand the incredible stress of being investigated & threatened.
The concept of, "No one's been *prosecuted* in the US, therefore running Tor relays has no potentially serious legal ramifications," is glossing over the dangers.
Running a relay may not be *the* most dangerous activity, but it sure carries significant risk.  Many that get tor-talk regularly have read that.
But some potential relay operators might not read tor-talk every day for months, to read about someone that got in serious legal trouble, before they decide to / not to run a relay.

Interesting.  Taking that account at face value, then apparently at times, the "rule of law" is as subjective in Austria as it is in many What do we take away from Weber's conviction?  That it's illegal (or at least punishable) to speak your mind in Austria?
Unless there's more to the story, I would think that judge believed he pulled a fast one, by "giving" Mr. Weber probation for something that's not against the law.
"Answered in an interview ... that he didn't give a ...?"  Was that an interview with the Pope or something?
There's no freedom of speech in Austria?  Or is cursing during interviews a possible felony?
If attitude or personal opinion were against the law, half the people in the world would be in jail.
I understand (completely) Mr. Weber's decision - right now - not to want to go through an appeal, but I'm concerned that after he's had some much needed rest & time to reflect, that he may regret accepting a guilty plea for something that apparently isn't against the law, even in Austria.

Thank you.  These links may be the only type of new(er) info available at this time, but unfortunately, none are legal documents or opinion.
At least from the legal system's view, they are just personal opinion.
Perhaps useful, but not the official documentation on the court's justification for the sentence (if I understand).
Which is what many people wanted to see - the court's legal opinion (right or wrong).
Regardless of the court's opinion or whether or not it's legal to run Tor relays, it won't change the fact that in certain circumstances, running Tor relays (especially exits) could cause significant stress, In the US after 1865 through the 1930's or '40's, it wasn't illegal to be a black person, but many were hanged & thousands more incarcerated for "other" crimes, that no white person would ever have been tried on.
In most cases, those black people weren't jailed or executed for the stated offense of "being black."
Yet, records show that many would never have been charged with crimes or approached by angry mobs, if they had not been black.
They committed no other real crimes but the courts & mobs found other reasons besides being black.
This is the way many societies have operated.  If the legal system, zealous prosecutors or judges *really*don't like what you're doing, they may just find something else to charge you with.
So, it's not *technically* illegal to do a lot of things, that under the right circumstances can still bring your world crashing down.
Even if it involves trumped up charges.
Which may be exactly one of the things that Tor operators need to be educated on.  How to avoid trouble, even if running a relay is technically legal.
How to protect themselves - *proactively*; how to stay under the radar, even if not doing anything "illegal."
Perhaps educate them on how not to make mistakes similar to those William Weber apparently did.

That may be true (from public perception).  But are a few sites like that on Tor worse than what's on the internet?
And the tons of crap (offensive stuff, to many people) on the net doesn't stop anyone from using it.
There's no uprising to shut the entire internet down.
I like Tor, but it's possible that if one priority is boosting general public opinion / approval for Tor, maybe not being mainly funded by the military would be a good step; when one of Tor's stated purposes is to provide people everywhere a means to avoid governments listening in.  That has *only* to do with average, John Q. Public's impression of Tor from a distance (which is much of what John Q. will ever see / understand).
Average people or even Congress persons don't care about *or understand* that "_Tor is open source & its code can be & is examined by Universities & software experts.  And if there was any funny business, one or more experts would discover it_."
To average people, those types of statements are a foreign language.
All they see is software intended for anonymity - largely from gov'ts - that itself is largely funded... by the gov't.  That is all they see.

Should TBB always start in partial window size?
Vanilla Firefox starts in maximized mode, if that was the state when closed (I think).
TBB always starts in partial screen mode, even if last closed while in full screen.  Many apps remember the last screen size.
Is there an anonymity reason to have TBB  start in partial screen?
It's a problem (in Windows) if I change the system DPI setting from default (96 DPI) to anything larger.  Even 105 - 110 DPI causes TBB's screen size buttons to be off the monitor.
Then the only way to maximize the UI is grab TBB's bottom border & drag it up.
That makes enough of TBB's title bar visible, to drag the window down & see the size buttons.
The method that works to make some apps start in full screen, of R-clicking the app's shortcut > Properties, then from the "Run" box select "maximized" has no effect on TBB starting size.

Thanks Georg,
Clearly I've forgotten or never knew why (partial) TBB window sizes can be spoofed, but standard multiples for maximized TBB windows *can't* be spoofed, instead.
? Don't a "majority" of users maximize something like browsers, for general use?  I've never seen it mentioned that most users leave TBB in partial screen.
I wouldn't think TBB (window size) would be used differently than regular browsers (a result of human habit).
I rarely see people using browsers in partial size, unless doing some between app operation / comparison.  I'm talking about what the masses do.
I don't understand your last statement in relation to the bug you linked:
There, Mike P. is clearly saying that maximizing TBB window poses a threat (under the right circumstances).  Am I misunderstanding it?
But, I'm unclear on which sentence (current TBB behavior) causes potential info leak, *IF users maximize* TBB:
The 1st sentence, "... content area is a 200x100...", or the 2nd one, "We also lie...."  Or, both?

Thanks.  Again, Mike Perry commented in "/...this potentially leaks information for users who maximize their browser windows.../"
Which raises the question, what % of users DON'T maximize (most) browsers they use, a good part of the time?
This all seems to ignore how a large % of users actually use a browser.
But, Mike says maximizing browser window potentially leaks info (as if ? most users don't maximize?); you say, "not per se."
I read # 7256 several times & other related bugs.  Many have reported in several bugs, their TBB testing results under various scenarios at different browser testing sites.
Using TBB maximized - significantly - increases fingerprinting entropy for screen and / or window size, for me & others reporting on it.
Enabling JS for the current page's domain - only - increases total bits of identifying info (bits ii) for TBB way, *way over* the threshold of 33 bits ii, that EFF.org says is needed to accurately identify a user (their browser, device) at different websites.
Yet, unless only visiting sites like blogs, most sites now perform poorly w/o JS enabled in NoScript, at least for their own domain (no 3rd So, you can turn off JS & be much more anonymous, but not be able to use a huge part of sites.

@_subject: [tor-talk] User views on lesser of 2 evils_Tor FAQ on using java 
How do some more advanced Tor users feel about pros & cons of leaving java script constantly enabled or selectively enabling it?
The overall java script issue & advice given at different times in different places can get confusing.
 From "There's a tradeoff here. On the one hand, we should *leave JavaScript enabled* by default so websites work the way users expect. On the other hand, we should *disable JavaScript* by default to better protect against browser vulnerabilities ( not just a theoretical concern!). But there's a *third issue*: websites can easily determine whether you have allowed JavaScript for them, and if you disable JavaScript by default but then allow a few websites to run scripts (the way most people use NoScript), then your choice of whitelisted websites acts as a sort of cookie that makes you recognizable (and distinguishable), thus harming your anonymity. "
Unless you're seriously hard core in how you use TBB (visit only sites KNOWN not to use JS), you're effectively forced into either
* disabling js completely & not being able to use / see a lot of the net (even hard core news sites, etc.) - that's bad.
* selectively enabling js - which the FAQ says is also bad.
* leaving js on 100%.  Which is also said to be bad.
Yes, I understand what happens with & w/o JS, as to sites detecting info (if interested).  The issue is being "...between a rock & a hard place."
Seems we must make a choice:  Whether more concerned about "some" sites detecting JS is DISabled, while others detect it's ENabled (& presumably, these sites are jointly owned, or all share info or 3rd party trackers are advanced enough to ID even a "stock" Torbrowser, from one site to another).
If one or more of the latter 3 scenarios isn't true (or something similar), then one site detecting JS is off & another detecting it's on, isn't an issue.
Seems the advice given in different areas may conflict.  There are a good many advanced users not in favor of having JS enabled by default in Unless they *only* visit JS free sites, they're forced to selectively enable it, unless don't care about broken sites.
But, enabling JS allows sites (that try) to get FAR more browser / system info than if it's disabled.
So, is it, "damned if I do, damned if I don't?"

My unprofessional reaction is, there's some discussion on this, but no scientific data / explanation why one way is the least worst.
Getting to that point may be difficult, but as is, seems Tor Project raises numerous questions but provides no real answers.
We have a product "to protect your anonymity."
"Oh, by the way... using JS may compromise it,
and not using it may compromise it (because it's enabled by default),
and using it intermittently may compromise it."
OK, that clears it up.  Even for fairly advanced users, that's not much There seem to be very strict Tor / TBB design rules, down to the tiniest Then, the issue of java script is pretty much left wide open.
Many ignore it, like the elephant in the room.
Since a chain (or security / anonymity method) is only as strong as its weakest link, where does that leave TBB, considering the range of views & facts about java script?
Sometimes, seems this little detail (that might break the entire chain) is simply glossed over.  It's a tough subject, so we just won't dwell on it.
Obviously, Tor Project decided to leave it enabled.  But there's ongoing discussion about limiting exposure due to js.

How do we know for a fact that observing exits (even several or many, operated by one entity) or multiple sites operated by one entity are "fringe cases?"
They may not be the gov't or NSA / GHCQ, but plenty of large, 3rd party trackers monitor 1000's of sites.
And if they have certain information, then for sure it's available to gov'ts (if only by theft) & possibly to others, especially at the right This type thing is no longer conspiracy theory.
Assuming that all works & doesn't have as many pitfalls as java script itself, the overall methods are likely beyond most users.
Beyond their ability & available time.  Beyond their ability to do all of what you mention and not make a mistake.
Unless Tor Project just sadly accepts that most users can't accurately carry out such practices (so don't bring it up at all), they don't seem to think it's important.

This is all interesting, but I'm still concerned that the use / non use And it seems like the family secret no one wants to discuss.
As outlined in the TBB FAQ, there are distinct drawbacks - no matter how js is approached.
Whether it's always allowed, (almost) never allowed, or configured per site - all 3 have distinct cons.
One problem is, there's no "ruling" from Tor devs.  One reason for that is disabling it breaks lots of sites.
But unless the MUCH greater amount of fingerprinting data that's available when JS * IS * enabled is not enough to be concerned about (I can't imagine that), then it may not matter how well * some *other data are concealed.
Plus, unless you go to only a few sites that require no JS, you have to turn it on - at least some.
But, enabling JS allows sites to get FAR more info & allows trackers to compare that fingerprint to other sites you visit (unless you change the fingerprint between each site).
And supposedly leaving JS off (if possible) distinguishes you from other TBB users that leave NoScript at the default setting.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What are use cases made unpleasant by Tor's speed? 
General question (to anyone):  Most users have noticed at times, TBB slowing to a halt.
Sometimes it might be the site's server - sometimes the relays in the built circuit & other times, something else.
How is Tor designed to handle when individual circuits are built, containing say, a relay current with throughput that's already at or near its capacity?
Does Tor detect that specific relays are already near capacity & drop it (them), for others that have significant, unused bandwidth?
As a test, when the speed of multiple sites is quite low, I've sometimes forced closing circuits.  Over time, I've noticed it often rebuilds the next circuit reusing 1 or 2 of the previous relays.
Often, the ones it reuses are very low bandwidth, but there's no way to instantly know if those reused relays are near their capacity. You just know that something is causing extreme slowness on multiple sites.
Then, TBB / Tor may speed up to where it's not half bad.  It's like a box of chocolates.
As many have said, it's not that TBB / Tor is slower than clear browsing.  But that it's so unpredictable, even unreliable at times, regarding speed.
Sometimes, "speed" isn't the right word.  It can be, "is it still alive, at all?  Do I still have a connection?"
No, it may never have generally consistent speeds, but sometimes it reminds me of the earliest internet days where at times, usability could be a problem on given days.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Spoofing a browser profile to prevent fingerprinting 
[Emphasis Added].  Don't know about enabling JS not being "big."
This isn't a "feeling" topic or discussion (general statement, not aimed at anyone).
Either we use facts (as best understood) to make decisions on this, or we don't.
I'm no expert on fine details of this, but over a long time of checking TBB, Firefox, JonDo Fox, etc., on multiple test sites, it's always clear that far more info is available when JS is enabled.
The EFF says ~ 33 bits of identifying info (ii) are needed to accurately identify the same browser / machine at multiple sites.
Even if that's just a ball park figure, when I visit Panopticlick, BrowserSpy.dk & others (many times, many browser versions, spread out over a yr +) , the difference in bits ii when JS is enabled or disabled, goes from well below 33 bits (in mid 20's) to well over 40 bits.
It's the same in vanilla Fx.
In vanilla Fx & NoScript - JS disabled, test sites might show * 24  bits of ii *.  Nearly as good as TBB w/ JS disabled.  Well under EFF's threshold to accurately identify a browser / device.
Enable JS in vanilla Fx & it shoots to * > 43 bits ii * (again, essentially the same as TBB under same scenario).
That appears to mean that vanilla Fx & NoScript w/ JS disabled, is no more * identifiable * as "the same browser" than TBB w/ JS disabled.
So either EFF's (& others) estimation on what's needed to identify a browser is considerably off, or enabling JS is a * BIG * deal.
Yes, in a smaller subset.  But, what good is being in a larger set of Tor users (that leave JS enabled), if doing so allows sites / trackers to clearly identify the same browser at multiple sites, or even end to end of Tor circuits, for advanced adversaries?
"Hiding" in a crowd, where you're still clearly identifiable doesn't make much sense.
Back to one main school of thought:  * an adversary needs X bits of identifying info * to accurately identify the same browser at multiple sites, or end to end in Tor circuits.
Do you want to be in a large crowd, where everyone reveals well over the required bits ii needed to accurately identify each one?
Or be in a smaller crowd, but users can't be individually identified - end to end, or site to site?
Unless this business of "necessary bits of identifying info to identify the same browser" is inaccurate & blown out of proportion.
That's where I have to rely on * real * experts.  Not on feelings or Either the results from repeated tests I've done, separated by many months, are meaningful or they're not.
Either ~ 33 bits of info (or anything close) will allow identifying a browser, or it won't.
If Tails, or any other means is needed to provide anonymity (while still being able to actually use the web), then those should be a part of Tor Unless the only goal is to hide destinations from ones ISP, then providing only part of what's needed in TBB for reasonable anonymity is...
*"Here's a browser / network that'll hide your IPa.  BTW, if you use it w/ JS, you can be identified at each end of a circuit and at each website."*

Thanks.  I won't reply to all your additional comments (too much to read at once).
If you don't mind, send me a screen / copy of your test results from Panopticlick (I guess that's where it was).
I've *never* gotten values as low as you show & they're able to read very little, if JS is disabled.
See my comments after your Panopticlick results.
I think I know what you meant, but this can't be a "thought" experiment.
Even the TBB FAQ approaches this from a reporter's view - covering all sides of an argument, but not reaching any conclusion.
That's fine for blogs & newspapers - not for anonymity software.  Java script is the topic we just ignore, because much of the web is useless w/o it & fingerprinting is tremendously increased with it.
Those among others.  This isn't a completely new concept.
Eventually, if everything goes right for trackers, profiling companies, NSA, etc., the 2 become 1.
It's been discussed that EFF (for instance) can be biased, because perhaps more Tor users & certainly those more privacy conscious visit Panopticlick, etc., than avg users.
Many may go repeatedly.
But, the data that test sites actually get / report from any one browser isn't biased.
Reporting, "your browser appears unique in X browsers," and "this is exactly what we can read" - are 2 different things.
The 1st one has some unknowns.
Ascertaining browser characteristics & reporting entropy isn't influenced by prior visitors.  Your 22 bits entropy is close to what I saw - if JS was disabled (TBB or Firefox).
With JS disabled, Firefox wasn't more fingerprintable than TBB (but theoretically should be).  That's a bit troubling in itself.
Yes, but blended with what?  A group of users that all can be fingerprinted well enough to be identified?
I know what Tor devs say about leaving JS on - in one breath, then seem to contradict (or warn about) in the next.
I'm not bad mouthing Tor Project, but the JS issue is confusing (by their own admission).
They raise more concerns / issue more warnings about JS than they ever I've *never* seen values that low with JS enabled or disabled, in TBB.
It's not as though I've changed the userAgent or other TBB spoofed values, that would change what they read from me vs. other TBB users.
One thing:  they still show *1.75 bits* entropy on things they can't read, or are spoofed the same for all TBB users.
Are you adding up all items w/ 1.75 bits (or what ever)?  There are 6 parameters in that category, alone.
*How do you get totals* of < 10 bits, when the "_can't read anything" items alone total > 10_ (when disable JS)?
That alone makes me wonder about your results (not saying wrong - just There's never a value of "0 bits entropy," even when they can't read anything for that parameter.
Unless, things like my screen size make that much difference.  But, with JS disabled, they can't read most parameters at ALL.
My 1st (2) values in the report are 6.5, 5.0 (rounded a tiny bit).
All the rest are 1.75 bits - because "no java script," & they can't read anything.  Except for cookies (turned off) - which is just under 2.0.
With JS disabled, most things they report reading in my TTB installs are the exact values that design documents say are spoofed by TBB & Torbutton.

Thanks to all for your input.
OK, I slept & revisited Panopticlick fingerprinting results   Silly me - I was looking at the values listed for each parameter, then assessing the total entropy for all parameters shown.
Yes, if I look at the value they report *in a sentence* above the results table, that total is far < than the sum of "bits of identifying information" for all browser characteristics measured, as shown in their results table.
For those that haven't looked at the site (or anything similar), the total entropy that Panopticlick arrives at is far < than the sum of individual values.
("The total is less than the sum of its parts" ??)
Like when it says,
"_Currently, we estimate that your browser has a fingerprint that conveys *13.72 bits* of identifying information_*,*" but the sum of all parameters in that same test is *far* > than 13.72 bits.
Maybe someone more familiar w/ their algorithm to arrive at the grand total "*bits of identifying information," *(that they state in a sentence, above the results table) can explain why their stated total entropy for the browser tested is *so much lower* than the total of all parameters shown in the table of test results.

Wow, I'm surprised no one has questioned this before or has a reasonable Why Panopticlick's total estimated entropy, *reported in the sentence _above_ their results table,* is much less than the sum of individual parameters' entropies - shown in the table:
"_Currently, we estimate that your browser has a fingerprint that conveys *nn.nn bits* of identifying information_."
To arrive at a total *"bits of identifying information"*, do they ignore characteristics with entopies < certain values?
Because, in a typical test - w/ JS ENabled, the sentence may show total entropy of *13.xx bits.*
In the same test,  the sum of entropies from their included table may be *34.xx* bits identifying information.
Why is there such a huge difference?  To arrive at their "total," what do they ignore - and WHY?

Is there anything *absolutely* preventing an operator from reading cookies between sites he owns?  At least, be able to recognize cookies he set on other sites?

Good question.  I've never sniffed ABP activities to see what it does when installed in TBB.  From memory, it shouldn't be phoning home, except to get updates.  Don't hold me to that.
It may / may not follow the rules & always use the Tor proxy, or transmit reveal your real IP, in unencrypted form, that someone could capture.  It really depends on who one is hiding from & for what purpose.
BTW, not a big deal, but most users on mailing lists add comments just below quoted material, or insert comments below each pertinent passage.  (or that's the way I was taught)  Opposite from how many do it in email.
Typically, only relevant previous comments are carried forward on mailing lists, especially for longer posts.

The reason given in the past by Tor Project leaders, was basically, they don't want Tor to be perceived as being unfriendly towards sites trying to make a bit of money to support their sites.
Some users don't disagree so much with sites presenting modest number of "non-intrusive" ads, but it's hard(er) to pick & choose which ads will be allowed, on which sites.
Ad Block Plus makes an attempt at that w/ its hotly debated, opt out method of "allow some non-intrusive advertising."
 >"I think one objection against manually installing AdBlock (or other similar > extensions) was that you make your TBB stand out from most other TBB..."
I haven't seen the "browser fingerprint testing sites" being able to detect all addons installed, as standard practice.  If java script is enabled, sites may be able to guess that specific addons are installed, by their actions - like preventing ads from loading. Even if JS isn't enabled, they might be able to see that ads aren't loaded & guess that ABP or something is installed.  But detecting / guessing all addons - never heard that.
But if only 25% of TBB users have ABP & IF... sites (or adversaries) "guess" that it's installed by its action, then in their estimation, they've narrowed that particular browser characteristic down to 25% of TBB users.
If one lives in a free society & is doing nothing illegal under local laws, nor particularly interesting to internet tapping agencies, that might not be terribly important.
On the other hand, what's legal  or "not a concern" to LEAs today, could change in the future.

It totally depends on how laws are worded, concerning any & all interactions with embargoed countries.  Maybe there's a clause that covers actions like this.
I'm not a legal or embargo rules expert, but I wonder if an embargoed country or individuals in it, giving money to a non-profit for which they receive nothing valuable, or that benefits the country financially, militarily or politically, actually violates the spirit of embargo laws.
I'm not sure the intent of embargo laws is to stifle free speech or access to information outside of a repressive gov't.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Sending email from Tor browser 
If you mean 1) setting up a completely anonymous email acct using TBB, then 2) always using TBB & only TBB to connect to that email (server), then it shouldn't matter when the email message is composed or sent.
It also depends to an extent on the email provider.  Some don't include your IPa in email headers, nor log it.  Even if they do, if all communication w/ the email server (or webmail) is through TBB, they only see the Tor exit relay address.
One possible exception might be if one uses an email client (possibly including addons, plugins) rather than the provider's webmail, that isn't configured correctly to use Tor network, or doesn't strictly follow settings to use Tor.  There are other possible ways that anonymity could be compromised.
Using webmail vs. an email client (like Thunderbird) may not be as convenient, but eliminating the client means one less thing that could possibly compromise anonymity.  TBB is *highly configured* to protect anonymity, where email clients generally are not.  When using email clients, it's largely up to users to configure them (vs. TBB ), then a matter of whether the clients will follow the configurations and / or have security issues or information leaks.
Torbirdy -  - "configures Thunderbird to make connections over the Tor anonymity network" - can be used, but it's still BETA.
The author also states, "This is an experimental add-on and it requires that a user has Tor installed.
It currently contains known leaks and until we have something feature complete without *known* leaks, we consider it experimental."

1st, it would be much better to use a more "private" & security conscious provider than the likes of Gmail or Yahoo.
Like Unseen.is or some others.  I wouldn't depend on claims by any, that they "can secure email from all security / law enforcement agencies."
Was the IPa shown in the email header the same as your Tor exit IPa, or your ISP's assigned address?
If using TBB & no addons or plugins that could possibly reveal your IPa, it shouldn't be possible for even Gmail to see your real IPa.
If you did use TBB (correcly) & your *real* IPa showed up in the email header, something's wrong.
Some email providers don't even include your IPa in the header - like Unseen.is, VFEmail & several others.
Unseen.is or any others aren't necessarily the magical answer to all email security & privacy issues.  For instance, at one time, Unseen claimed "end to end" strong encryption *between* Unseen users - if using their webmail.  You can read their disclosure on the latest "modified" PGP encryption they provide.
I pointed out to them that the encryption, while *on their servers* may be very good, there was still a hole in that strong encryption, in between their server & users' computers.  That part of the communication was "only" SSL / TLS encryption - which some Snowden documents indicated the NSA *had broken* (I believe - my head is killing me today).  That one gap essentially made their encryption process no better than many other providers, (a chain is only as strong as its weakest link).    Except mail on their servers was stored encrypted, which kept them from reading it.
Since then, they developed their own desktop client, allowing users to encrypt msgs locally before sending.  I haven't used it yet, so can't comment on that client, or whether retrieving messages with the client maintains "strong" encryption between their server & users' computers (stronger than SSL / TLS).  I assume that now w/ the local client & users encrypting messages before sending, that the private keys are generated & stored on users' computer rather than on their server.
For free accounts - using webmail, the private keys were stored on their server (may still be, if using webmail).  Now there's an alternative to webmail.  But that also requires trusting their client & the encryption software / algorithm.
Here is a comparison of some of the more "privacy conscious" providers:
When considering Simple Computer's information (or any other), *check with the providers* for final details.  Providers' policies & technology used can change at any time.
For instance, Simple Computer's comment:  "Unseen does not plan to support Internet Explorer for chat & video, and the current Tor Browser Bundle (3.6.1) is built on Firefox 24 ESR which lacks features in its JavaScript engine to work properly with Unseen," is *not true* anymore (AFAIK).  I use TBB w/ Unseen's webmail.  Months ago, there were some temporary problems in using their site with TBB, but after I reported them, Unseen made changes on their side that seem to have fixed it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Sending email from Tor browser 
Yes, just note the address shown on the Tor Check site, then send a msg using TBB - *right away.*
The IPa assigned to the msg (if the provider includes it) is based *on the address being used when it's sent.*  Whether that's a Tor address or if not using Tor, your real ISP assigned address.
Assuming the Tor exit didn't change from the time you looked at it, until you sent the msg - a few seconds later, the IPa in email header & on Tor Check (or in Vidalia, if used) should be the same.
One possibility why it would fail is if the browser failed to connect to Tor network.  But, if that happened, you should see a huge warning about that on the TBB startup page.
Reminder to newer users of email & Tor (and to me) - depending on WHAT you're trying to keep private AND from whom (from an ISP?... or from the NSA?), when you send a "test" message from a Tor created email acct, to another acct of yours, theoretically those 2 accts could be tied together.  Especially if the provider for the non-Tor acct had your real IPa, real mobile phone  or real name (as for an email acct w/ your paid ISP).
No - Gmail or such isn't going to tie the Tor acct to the other email address you sent a msg to (at least, not for now), but some more powerful entities could do that, if they were interested.
Whether one is talking about any "illegal" or highly interesting things in Tor email or not, it should probably be assumed that many / most electronic communications are being stored.
If msgs are NOT encrypted w/ something strong like PGP, it probably should be assumed that they could be decrypted (if "they" were so inclined).  And if the msgs are just stored today, it's a distinct possibility even strong encryption could be broken in the not too distant future.

I was speaking of using TBB (not any old browser), so for *average* users, TBB is more highly & professionally modified for anonymity than most email clients would be (for average users).
If you disagree w/ that, then why use TBB at all?
Yes, some clients like Tbird can supposedly be configured to behave anonymously - but perhaps not by average or below average users.
Torbirdy is still beta - & the dev warns about bugs.  What ever email client one uses over Tor, research it well & test all the possible ways  it can mess up, that you come across while doing research - IF... anonymity is critical.
That's partly why I said (using TBB) on an email provider's webmail, that outwardly respects users privacy, may be (not "will be") easier to maintain anonymity than configuring Tbird and / or using beta software like Torbirdy - for average users.  If it were me & I was truly concerned about anonymity, I wouldn't use TBB w/ Gmail, Yahoo, LiveMail, etc.  They are the *antithesis* of respecting privacy.
Why would anyone complain about bad behavior of Gmail & their ilk?  That's like trying to make your tent safe in a lion's den. Just don't pitch a tent in a lion's den.  There are lots of other choices.
Pick a provider off the Simple Computer list or others that have good reputations for privacy.  Again, anyone considering a privacy respecting or security enhancing email provider, read their TOS & Privacy Policy - well - to get the latest, accurate policies, then ask them questions, if need be.  Many allow using clients for POP or IMAP, but average users will have to research a lot to make it anonymous through Tor.

Nah, that would make too much sense.
When politicians want to take illegal contributions or gifts, they find a way around rules & have done so for 1000's of yrs.
According to some reports, Google has been the 2nd largest "spender" on Capitol Hill, for the last 2? yrs.  They get what they want & (usually) do what they want, because of handing out "free pens" to Congress.
It's OK for an organization dedicated to providing anonymity to protect users - everywhere, in no small part from various gov't agencies, to take major funding from... a gov't agency.  Yet, that organization can't take *private* donations from a country w/ embargo restrictions.  Don't make no sense, Jethro.

I wouldn't expect any one or small group to just jump in & defy the current interpretation of embargo laws - without serious research & I haven't read the statutes covering any sort of transaction between a US non-profit & a private citizen in an embargoed country & I may not - Where such a transaction would not benefit the country,  or even the private donor, in any financial, military, political manner, etc.; only promoting access to free speech & information, which in all likely hood, could lead to citizens *forcing change* on the very policies / actions, that lead to the country being embargoed in the first place.
Forbiding this specific transaction, given the specific circumstances, would seem to be the definition of cutting off one's nose to spite their In the world & US history, there are 1000's of cases where something was once entrenched as being illegal, but became legal, often because someone stood up & fought to change it.

No, the law is often temporary, until someone has the guts to stand up (100's, maybe 1000's of times, in the last 150 yrs, in U.S. alone).
This & many countries were founded entirely on standing up against repression; by "revolutionists."
Hell, in the U.S., we celebrate & honor revolutionists - of the most extreme kind - every 4th of July.  Politicians give speeches all over the U.S., about how great the revolutionary militants were.
But then somehow, if in current day, people talk about changing the status quo - for really important issues, like civil rights, they're branded militants that need to be silenced by any means necessary.
"It was OK for the founding fathers to be extreme militants, but no one can do it after that, or they'll go to jail."
I'm not saying Tor Project (by themselves) should start a revolution over embargo laws.  But that scenario is similar to historical cases (in some respects).  Women couldn't vote; black people had to use different restrooms, water fountains.  I personally saw that growing up in the South.  On all those things & hundreds more, someone / some group had to stand up - & do more than send an email, that can be deleted by a flunkie, for anything to change.
Very true - more so w/ people already using Tor or those that would never look at how Tor is funded.
But if some sayings were ever true, it's, "Perception is reality," and "You're judged by the company you keep."
People on the outside looking in, see an organization, whose primary purpose is to provide means to protect privacy, *especially* from gov't agencies, but the major portion of their funding comes FROM a gov't agency.
I'm sorry - but no matter how much I or anyone else loves Tor, to many "thinking" outsiders, it would appear quite fishy (if they know that funding fact).  "It just don't look right."
I think it's fishy - _& I like Tor_.  If I'd actually known that fact before I used it, I'd have thought something wasn't right.
It may be, if they really want to grow the Tor user base (continually), it may have to appeal to a broader audience, for many of whom the funding source issue may well be a stumbling block.

I'm not accusing Tor Project of anything underhanded.  And you are correct (it funds a lot of research).
I'm saying, to the public & many potential users, perception is reality, and you're judged by the company you keep.
In general, those human behaviors / concepts are inescapable.
In regards to the code being open for inspection, apparently that doesn't mean a whole lot.
Though most of the "hidden" backdoors, etc., associated w/ gov't action have been proprietary, there have been a few cases where "strange" things in open source code were hidden well enough, that no one discovered them for a long time.  If I'm wrong, I stand corrected.
Seriously, how many people that don't work on Tor / TBB code every day, could just "look" at the code & understand every single thing it does, down to the tiniest detail?
Or how many people actually have the time to examine every single line of code, that also have the expertise to understand everything, to the smallest detail?  Not many.
If that's not significant, the NSA has spent billions (w/ a 'B') - to encourage companies & countries to do what they want.
They also developed skills & a network, that most people thought unimaginable.  Like science fiction.  That's now a fact.  When I mentioned that potential capability a few yrs ago, that idea was shot down by Mr. Perry.  In his defense, he was in good company - most people couldn't imagine they could ever do the things that actually became true.
That said, if NSA & who knows who else, will pay tens or hundreds of millions to companies & countries to get what they want, they *certainly* would spend whatever it took to set up enough of their own relays to capture a significant % of Tor traffic. Still think that's impossible?  Read ALL of the released Snowden document.   I heard Snowden say in recent interview, there are more documents coming - probably this Summer - that are just as mind blowing, or more, than any so far.
OK - but what about Tor's encryption?  Well, it may be uncrackable today, but what about in a month?  The NSA & many other gov'ts have literally the best computer minds in the world, working around the clock on breaking encryption. No, a lot of others (much more informed than me) don't think the gov't is going to sit around & do nothing, while terrorists or other heinous criminals use encrypted communication.
And some (naive) people may not know this, but gov'ts *don't announce* when they develop technology that revolutionizes spying or catching terrorists, etc.  It would be shooting themselves in the foot.  The Snowden papers were almost a once in several lifetimes event.  And if we think the NSA (or any gov't agency in the world) will stop illegal activities, just because some papers were released, we probably also believe in Santa Clause.  Heads of the NSA were caught straight up, telling bald-faced lies under oath to Congress, but all are still employed.  Happy as pigs in the mud.  If I had done that, I'd be *under* the jail right now.
Yes, I believe the NSA & other agencies have a job to do.  The question, how far do they actually have to go?

In at least the last couple TBB versions, or longer, I've found FlashPlayerPlugin_x.x.exe (latest *13_0_0_214.exe) running in background - numerous times.
Actually, 2 instances of flash exe files are always shown running.
Biggest question is, what is Flash doing to Tor anonymity in these cases.  Just because Flash isn't playing doesn't mean it's not contacting someone, somewhere.
I rarely use Flash - I assume TBB *now comes w/ it installed?*  The only time I would use it, is for something there appeared to be no other way possible AND on a site I wasn't concerned about.  Then immediately get a new identity.
Flash is NOT activated in TBB (always set to *"never activate"*) & I've never played any Flash content the times I've found the flash files I'm not sure that when the flash files are found running, that I had played ANY video content at all.
By contrast, when I rarely play youtube vids in TBB, if it can't / won't play in HTML5, it always shows Flash as disabled or missing, & prompts to d/l it.
I'm not sure why that event would start these files running in background, if it does.
In Process Explorer, one flash*.exe instance has command line: The other has command line:  \...\flash\NPSWF32_13_0_0_214.dll" --host-npapi-version=27 --type=renderer
Both of those are shown under the process:  G:\Program Files\*Tor Browser\Browser\browser" - 7344 plugin* - (where TBB is installed).
Of all the times I've caught it, I don't believe Flash ever started uninvited under Firefox.
Activity history for the 2 files show they do write & read to disk, but I haven't sniffed them to see if they try to contact a server.
Has anyone ever looked in task manager or a process explorer & noticed these running?
Other than uninstalling Flash, how can I keep them from silently starting in background?

No, I think it's more likely that if Flash plugin is installed for one version of Fx, it gets installed for all versions of Fx.
That may explain how it gets there, but not why it starts 2 flash executables in background, when the plugin in TBB has always been, & still is set at "Never Activate."
It's not like I'm temporarily activating the plugin, playing some Flash vids, then forgetting to disable it.
As said, I never see the Flash files that run in background, being *associated w/ regular Fx* - only TBB.  They're always listed under Tor Browser - in Process Explorer window.
Has to be a bug?  If I catch the files running in background (as process under TBB), then immediately check TBB plugins status - & it's still disabled, how could that be?
Again, the same version Flash plugin is installed in regular Fx & those 2 Flash files *never start in background, under it.*
I (maybe) can just remove the plugin from TBB - I rarely use Flash. But if I keep it in regular Fx - for emergencies - I'll have to keep removing it in TBB.  Sometimes, I'll forget, cause I don't think of plugins being installed in TBB.

Even though _no Flash vids are ever played_.  Below - Some additional replies to previous comments.
OK, it probably gets installed in TBB, at same time as for regular Fx, but it's always automatically set to disabled in both.
I can deal w/ that, or just remove it? each time Flash is updated. But *figuring out what's going on may lead to bug report for TBB.*

Are you saying you have Flash processes running under Fx (not TBB)?
1) Did you use Flash player in Fx, that would have started them, or do you not know what started them?
2) Updating Flash: this has existed _over many Flash & TBB versions_. Each Flash ver. is completely uninstalled, before installing new one.
Each TBB version is installed to new folder. An infection is very low probability. No other signs & AV doesn't detect anything.
Besides, AFAIK, the Flash files just sit there. They show a very few I/O bytes after starting, then nothing - for hours after the starting time 3) Yeah, I'd be happy to upload a Process Explorer screen - not sure I can do that, unless the list *will allow jpg attachments?* Will it?
4) It's been very hard to predict or catch the Flash files starting. When I try visiting sites w/ Flash content that might start them, they don't start (short of playing Flash content, which I never do in TBB).
It hasn't happened in last several days of using TBB.
5) >"/Do not run any software. Run only tor-browser/"
That would mean a *long time* w/o use of my computer - possibly days, weeks. It's not like it happens within 30 min. (or at all), every time I use TBB.
It does not happen every TBB session. When I catch the files running, I've tried re-visiting pages I may have visited recently, w/o success at reproducing it.
But, sometimes the files have been running a good while & revisiting every single page PLUS *repeating exact navigation / clicks* on all pages may be nearly impossible.
That's why I'm here. If it was easily & quickly reproducible, I probably wouldn't need to ask for help.
I have no proof yet, but one theory is some websites could have java script, or 3rd parties - that NoScript somehow doesn't block.
I generally don't leave "Scripts globally allowed" enabled. That doesn't mean something can't slip by.
Occasionally, sites require js from their base domain to even load or navigate a page. If you enable it, there could? be code, that tries to start Flash player, to automatically load or play some content.
I'm just guessing.

OK, but that's completely different than what I'm doing or have experienced.  I guess... haven't been able to pin down exactly what causes the flash files to start.
*Maybe if I could save a log* of which sites were visited w/ timestamps & compare that w/ starting times of the flash files, I would know which site I was on.
At the moment, I'm not sure if I have anything that'll log even IP addresses w/ time stamps.
When I TRY to catch it - go to sites w/ Flash.  Only blank screens load saying, "Flash is not installed.  Please download it so we may sniff your system."
Then I've tried clicking or R clicking on the area where the player screen would be (but NOT on download Flash, nor on any play button - if one existed).
But I can't make the flash files start when I'm watching for them.
No, the 2 flash executables are definitely listed as descendants under the Tor Browser process.  Process Explorer GUI / its tree & icons shown are crystal clear on that.
In fact, a COUPLE of times when I was watching the 2 files, then at same time closed Tor Browser, the files immediately disappeared. Seemingly proof they were running as part of the Tor Browser (or Tor) process.

Checking vanilla Fx, I don't see it's *storing anything* in webappsstore.sqlite either, even though the default about:config entry "dom.storage.enabled" = true.
Maybe? that's because I have all disk cache disabled in vanilla Fx, as is Torbrowers' default?
Unless youtube doesn't attempt to use DOM storage, with 1st party cookies & java script allowed for both youtube.com & ytimg.com, in vanilla Fx.
It's good nothing's being stored (even in Fx), except you can't verify which delete history / cache / storage method removes DOM data.
Something else must be going on.
BTW, the "Design Document - DRAFT" (dated March 15, 2013 ) that's linked from TorProject's main page, has non-functioning link for the patch in the line below about DOM storage.
It says "404 - Cannot find file"
 1. /DOM Storage
    DOM storage for third party domains MUST be isolated to the url bar
    origin, to prevent linkability between sites. This functionality is
    provided through a patch to Firefox

EDIT:  There is data stored in webappsstore.sqlite in vanilla Fx, if it's allowed.
The sqlite viewer I was using -  - doesn't display the contents of  copy of that file.
It apparently displays some other Fx sqlite files OK.  Dunno.
I know Mozilla has an addon sqlite viewer & I've used it, but would prefer a stand alone, as it's seldom used.
Don't need another addon, potentially causing probs, used once in 3, 6 or...? months.
If anyone has a better suggestion for a free viewer, preferably portable, I'd appreciate it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Importance of individual useragent items 
I noticed there are at least 2 different references in Torbrowser for useragent over ride strings.
The Panopticlick site picks up this one: "/Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0/," though there's another shown in about:config: extensions.torbutton.useragent_override;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:17.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/17.0.
Aside from the fact there are 2 strings shown in about:config, the string that Panopticlick detects shows Windows 7 (32 bit - I assume).
Several Windows usage by version sites show Win 7 64 bit as much more common.  If true, why doesn't Torbrowser use that in its useragent?
The string in Torbrowser may be one of the most common setups? Some "useragent info" sites show 64 bit OSes are more common in the string.   In my 1st visit to Panopticlick in a long time, using Torbrowser - it Browser Characteristic:  User Agent
bits of identifying information:  6.73
one in x browsers have this value:  105.86
value: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0
For the useragent string alone, 1 in 106 is pretty low.
A "test" for one of THE currently most common useragents shown on some updated lists of common useragents   - in vanilla Fx:
general.useragent.override;  Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:29.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/29.0
showed on Panopticlick that ~ 1 in 350 or 360 browsers had that useragent.  Still not bad, but 3.5 x the estimate for Torbrowser's *That value could be skewed* by fewer or more Tor users visiting Panopticlick than Vanilla Fx users.  Still interesting.
One statistics site,  shows Win 7 64 bit usage far exceeds the 32 bit, by 4.22 : 1.
Note: must allow js for steampowered.com; to expand the statistics line items (shown below), must allow js for steamstatic.com.
The values are for "usage" as of May 2014;  Unsure where they get statistics.  The +/- values are change in percentage, since???
Another "pretty" site, for all kinds of computer hardware / OSes / browser share, is   I'm not affiliated w/ either site in any way.

Other than the fact that accessing sites comes from Tor exit nodes, they could easily spoof the useragent the same as one of the most popular That may / may not be of any value, depending on how many sites check for Tor exits.  Creating a set of only Tor users definitely limits the number of users to get lost among, especially at sites w/o many Tor users.
Maybe Tor devs aren't able to blend w/ general internet users, so the selected Torbrowser useragent isn't that important.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Downloading Programs with TBB - dangerous??? 
That used to be the norm, but I believe the message was changed in later TB versions.  Which version are you using?
I'm not sure I've seen that warning lately, for just saving a PDF.
Pretty much the same precautions as regular surfing, as far as "dangerous" files - whether inside Tor / Torbrowser or not.
The advice is generally, don't open downloaded files while online. Certainly not in or using Torbrowser (like a PDF, using built PDF viewer).
But that viewer isn't AS big of an anonymity breaking threat as using 3rd party software over the Tor network.  They don't always follow the Tor proxy rules.
For some (like Thunderbird) people have gone to great lengths to create software / plugins, etc., to make sure it stays inside the Tor network.  Even those methods aren't 100% foolproof, 100% of the time.
Much depends on whether using 3rd party software for the downloading, or even Fx addons used in Torbrowser.  If just d/l a PDF or txt file, etc., saving it to disk / DVD - from the browser save window isn't a problem.
Of course, most any file could be malicious or its extension be intentionally mislabeled.
The addons may be OK, or they may leak data like real IPa, or something else.  One shouldn't assume because they're listed on Mozilla AMO, that they maintain anonymity over Tor.  They might - but they might not.

Even for a summer intern?  I'm not a software engineer, but I don't get what's so difficult about grabbing the basic data (already available) for relays in use & displaying in text format.
Yes, "we have other things to do."  I'd think some 2nd & 3rd yr students could do this job, or a number of viewers out in Tor-land.
Even the most basic browser shows which URL you're using - if not the IPa.  I'd think for persons in extremely repressed countries & other situations, seeing the countries in the circuits might be important.
It wouldn't have to have all the bells & whistles of Vidalia - not right away.  *Some* of those old features would be nice for the future.
Don't need a world map, or pretty flags of every country represented, or the ability to click on any listed relay (not in a current circuit) & get its info.
Just bare bones:  here's your current circuit & others built, but not used, along w/ the basic info for any relays.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Bruce Schneier's Guardian Article about N_S_A and 
Yes, and then it may become a partly theoretical / partly real world discussion of (the "real world," mind-blowing part being based on Snowden releases):
* It has to be assumed that the major world gov'ts will not sit idly by, while enemies of their states use (any) communication method right under their noses and say, "Oh well, the bad guys are too smart for us."
* to what lengths of time & (our) money are world gov't agencies willing to go to break encryption - of anything? (the U.S. isn't the only one)
* what else have gov'ts developed to identify users thru fingerprinting or methods we haven't dreamed of yet?  Remember how blown away everyone was about the Snowden documents.  It would be totally wrong to assume that Snowden was able to gather & release *all* methods in use or being developed, to "crack the internet."  Likely, for every thing he disclosed, there were *many other earth-shattering ones left undisclosed.*
* In many countries, the gov't doesn't care about proving you're an enemy of the state, beyond a reasonable doubt.  That's a whole other conversation.  In "kinder, gentler," advanced democracies, gov'ts are now so powerful (as shown by Snowden documents), that if they have good suspicion you're threatening national security or running drug / sex slave operations, they may eventually get you, even if you don't use the internet at all.
They are willing to spend as much of our money as it takes to infiltrate any & every thing, that they perceive to be a real threat or a significant tool of powerful enemies.  And up to a point, that may be a good thing.  But when has  gov't shown wisdom of knowing when some action is going too far?
And while Tor or any great organization or company you choose, has incredibly talented people, the major world gov'ts have 1000's of people *just as talented - working round the clock.*  Long term, it's going to be hard to outwit them & completely impossible to outspend them.  That doesn't mean people shouldn't try.

You can't click the arrow beside the Torbutton icon in toolbar (green onion) & select "new identity?"
That should ? build a new circuit.
Vidalia is / was? available for d/l as a *stand alone* app, on Tor Project's site.  (NOT the exact same as old Vidalia).
Extract it to a folder you create inside the Torbrowser folder.
Can create a shortcut on desktop, etc., for "Start Vidalia.exe."
Always start TB, *before* launching Vidalia (different from the past, where Vidalia was integrated in TB).
At least, it was offered for d/l not long ago, to use as stand alone w/ TB 3.x series.
When I've used this Vidalia in TB for Windows (for testing), after starting it, takes maybe 60 sec for it to populate its listings.
Can't speak to the safety of using the stand alone Vidalia, but I guess if it's found unsafe, they'll remove its d/l link (if any advanced users actually look for security / privacy problems in using this Vidalia).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Bruce Schneier's Guardian Article about N_S_A and 
I'm not addressing whether Tor or anything else, or the people involved are good, bad, bullet proof or riddled with holes.  Simply pointing out what was widely believed / accepted as fact - before & after Snowden.
Most of what you & others (mentioning same points) about the last 2 paragraphs is true.  Even some of what various gov'ts say may be true - to a point (the U.S. isn't the only one involved) .
But, the *exact* wording of laws, contracts & lies... uh..., speaking points of politicians is critical. ~  /"They have never attacked / used any gathered email or electronic communication against [fill in country name here]."/
Maybe *they* haven't directly used any gathered data against citizens  (which before Snowden, or B.S., they absolutely denied before Congress, any gathering of data on general population, at all).
But that wording, or the questions asked of them, doesn't seem to preclude them giving the data to "someone" else, who then might use it.  Nor rule out retaining the data, for future use.
Or... perhaps everyone should immediately ignore anything they say, if it's assumed that, if... they (any gov't agency) _*told bald faced lies before_ to the public & respective countries' legislative bodies,* about them violating the Constitution & numerous laws (at least, in the U.S.), then they certainly *might* lie again... & again...  Which scenario is more likely?
And just assume, based on past behavior, that anything they say, whether under oath or not, is worthless & meaningless.  That's why James Bond was called a *"secret agent," * not a "full public disclosure agent."
Based on the secretive operation & capabilities of various gov't agencies (by design), is it even reasonable to say w/ any certainty, that they are likely only monitoring the exit traffic?  That in some fashion, they don't have the ability to monitor "enough" entering / exiting Tor traffic, that they can't identify one person at both ends?  Not that they're interested in "average" users.
Not that they may NOT be able to do this (yet). But based on revelations in Snowden's documents, of mind-blowing operations, abilities that are 30+ yrs ahead of industry or the public AND staggering monies spent, that a real possibility exists that almost nothing developed by humans is out of their reach - by any one of many methods, including bribery?
All of that - & more - is exactly what the Snowden documents showed, at least for _what those documents covered_.
How can it be ruled out of the realm of realistic possibility,  that very likely the Snowden's documents revealed only a fraction of what the U.S. (& probably other gov'ts) are doing or their capabilities (or what may soon be a capability)?
Those documents showed, that much of what some persons had believed (who were previously labeled as serious conspiracy nuts) about many countries' gov't programs & capabilities, which had always been written off by the general public as futuristic science fiction, *was indeed true. *
There is no arguing with that one fact.  What ELSE the "gov't" can / can't do, or may soon be able to do, that the documents don't cover (given their budget is astronomical), is another topic.

On  the page(s) that would normally come after entering user name & PW is blocked.
Instead, submitting login data & page "refreshes",  I just see a blank web page w/ a "throbber" in middle of page.
Same thing happens when creating a free acct - at top of page at address in above link.
After submitting data for new acct, browser refreshes, new page loads & the blank page w/ throbber just sits.  But (for me), the acct was actually created.
I found that out from their support.
FYI:  to create an acct, don't actually need a *valid* "Primary Email Acct."*  You have to enter an address in the form, but I don't think it has to be working, or it can be a disposable address.
After submit login data, even though the page is now blank, the URL in address bar has changed (from orig. Unseen.is), to reflect (I believe) the next page that's normally displayed after login.
*Login works* - using a standard Fx profile (even w/ NoScript & some other addons).  In a regular profile, after submitting the login data, the SAME blank page w/ a throbber appears for a few seconds, then Difference being, in a regular profile, the blank page w/ throbber disappears after a few sec & brings up next page.  In TBB, the blank page never disappears.
Even after the URL in address bar has changed, I also can't just delete the "node" for the blank page (overlay), to reveal the 1st page inside my account.
I was unable to tell from Fx web console, what causes the blank page to permanently hang.  Someone else might be able to see it.
I've noticed the exact same problem in regular Fx... IF... I use the "JonDoFox" profile -  created by the extension of same name.
The profile that JonDoFox creates, makes many of the same changes to prevent browser fingerprinting that TBB and / or Torbutton make.
Javascript is enabled for Unseen.is domain in all cases.  In NoScript, I tried both whitelisting it & allowing scripts globally - no difference.
Login on this siteSince in a regular Fx profile works, but not in TBB or a JonDoFox profile.
The "regular" Fx profile can contain NoScript, Ghostery, Adblock Plus, CookieMonster, HTTPS Everywhere, etc., & still allow login.  So, guessing? it's not those extensions causing the problem.
I even disabled and / or uninstalled potential problem extensions (NoScript, etc.) in both TBB & the JonDoFox profile - no change.
I conclude the issue is a change made by *both* TBB (or Torbutton) and JonDoFox extension.
Either it's some - other - change made (assuming in about:config) by both TBB & JonDoFox, that is NOT directly related to their included OR... the problem is some change(s) that *IS associated* w/ their included addons (NoScript, etc.) but *disabling or uninstalling* the extensions installed by TBB & JonDoFox, doesn't correctly reset all about:config changes they made.
Unseen's support dept was clueless.   They definitely don't block TBB / Tor.
If anyone has an Unseen acct or wants to look / try creating a free acct, be aware they're upgrading part of their system "for couple hrs" as of Sun. 3/2 @ approx. 2 PM, Pacific Std. Time.
So it may not be available for a while.

Further, guessing ?? after some recent change the site made, now that URL / page won't display in TBB 3.5.2 - at all.  Just see the blank page w/ a throbber / star.
But, another address CAN be accessed & log in to an acct, using TBB:    Even WITH private browsing mode enabled.
Unclear to me the exact reason one address fails & other succeeds - I'm sure there is one.
Not sure of all code differences of the 2 addresses.

But *blocking* that tracker in *regular Fx* doesn't prevent correctly loading  or logging into an acct from it.
The issue in TBB doesn't seem only related to javascript, NoScript, private browsing.  Of course, you're going to have to enable cookies (at least for that site) to login.
Cookies (session or temp) - per site, can be allowed in TBB thru a cookie manager, like CookieMonster.
Even w/ "Private Browsing" still enabled.
I'm not saying it's the best choice, just as a test, it makes an acct accessible via TBB w/o disabling other private browsing function.

I'm sure I recently checked what screen size TBB (Windows) was giving out.  Which ever version I checked it in, test sites did NOT show my actual monitor size.
Now, in TBB 3.5.2, my actual screen size seems to show on several browser test sites.
Even extracted TBB again, into clean folder & re-checked.  Still shows my *actual* screen size on test sites.
I thought decision was made / implemented to report same screen size for This is a problem - for couple reasons, for me.
IF... I set Windows system DPI slightly > default of 96 (else it's too damn small), then w/o TBB properly spoofing screen size, sites will detect a size that's NEITHER the same as other TBB users, nor a "standard" size.
Changing Windows' DPI setting will make my detected screen size an "oddball" size - that almost no one has.
Anyone else notice TBB isn't spoofing a "default" screen size anymore, or have ideas why it isn't spoofing mine correctly?

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBrowser spoofed screen size? 
Yes, that's screen "resolution," or just resolution.  It's of some significance, but it's not the same as "screen (or monitor) size."
Screen size is what I meant (like 1280 x 720, etc.).  That's the value I'm asking what TBB is now supposed to spoof (what IS that value).
Note:  it may? be working correctly for me (dunno)... except, since neither I nor millions, keep their system DPI set at default (in Windows, often 96), then the TBB spoofed screen size, modified by the DPI adjustment, gives a VERY weird number (sort of like:  1657 x 841, 1920 x 892 etc.).  So weird, it's probably FAR more noticeable / unique, than just showing my real screen size, or somehow? spoofing my own (believable) value.
But, EVEN WHEN  I reset my system to 96 DPI, reboot - TBB still shows a weird value - like 1920 x *933* (just an example).
NO one has a screen size w/ those odd numbers.  That's the issue.
Try checking your screen size at these sites (they do thorough jobs, in varying degrees).
They're quite well known.   At BrowserSpy.dk, must click each test separately.  There, the test is "screen."
You may have to enable javascript (if turned off) in NoScript, for some sites to detect certain browser or system values (a lesson unto itself about JS giving up info).
But, at least *parts* of many sites won't work w/o java script - a double edged sword.
Browser check sites:
 From JonDoFox group: IP check Panopticlick-EFF.org_Browser.Uniqueness BrowserSpy.dk_Browser Privacy Tests I can't remember what TBB was reporting, the last time I checked on one of those sites.
For those using system default DPI values, TBB may be correctly spoofing a fairly common is size (or not).
If others would, please check to see if it's spoofing a "common" screen size, or a weird one.
If you report a "sort of" size back here, please state if you use default OS DPI value, or higher / lower.
I read a bunch on Trac, but *never found* the final draft for what size(s) they'd show.  I'm pretty sure none of the choices were 1920 x 869.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBrowser spoofed screen size? 
Thanks Georg, but I think? we're talking about different things.
The bug  is about the size of TBB window when it's launched (whether it fits on monitor, etc.).
The issue in THIS post, is the "screen size" (monitor size), that can be detected by sites for fingerprinting purposes as opposed to how well the TBB UI fits on the monitor when it's 1st launched.  Not the same things - though possibly ? related.
On the browser test sites mentioned, I'm not running the tests w/ TBB window partially enlarged (as when 1st launches).
But to clarify / add to your comment here, IF... one DOES run the browser tests w/ TBB UI in "non-full screen mode," the test sites will show *different* detected screen size than when it's maximized.
And, if you zoom the TBB screen (Ctrl + scroll), the test sites detect a different "screen size," as well.
Different issues than my original question on this post, but worth noting.

Following up on inconsistency of spoofed TBB screen sizes, shown on test I did more testing / checking.  Then posted comments on Trac  & comment For me, with each browser fully maximized, there's a *fundamental difference* in what the test sites see for "screen size" of regular Firefox (27), VS. TBB 3.5.2.
Same monitor, same displayed toolbars (of nearly identical heights) in both browsers - but vastly different "screen size" detected.
This would SEEM to make TBB users stick out like a sore thumb!?  It seems to be a large problem, *regardless* of the system DPI setting (default, or custom value).

I need to control the country for exit relays - temporarily, while set up an email acct w/ TBB - then remove the restriction. Vidalia's not required to force exit relays in Tor, but makes it easier to see counties actually used.
Anyway, I've not found many details on how to edit Vidalia settings now so it will detect that Tor is already running (it is). Especially when TBB is not on C:\.
As opposed to what the Vidalia settings file still shows as a check box (the *old* way of how Vidalia / Tor worked):  "Start Tor software when Vidalia starts;"
instead of... how the FAQ instructions  seem to indicate?, just put Vidalia anywhere & start it anytime after TBB is running... (~ no mods needed & they'll find each other).

It's true (sort of) - Vidalia stand alone doesn't seem to need any modifications for it to work w/ TBB 3.5.x.
Except, seems you need to extract Vidalia to its own folder, inside the main TorBrowser folder??
Then, Vidalia (sometimes) shows the relays, if you start it after TBB is already running / connected to Tor network.
But, it's buggy for me.  At least a couple times already, I had to delete all Vidalia files from its folder, then extract it again.
It would work for a couple of TBB starts (then start Vidalia). After a few successful restarts of TBB & Vidalia, on another restart, Vidalia may suddenly report "Tor isn't running."  But it is.
It did this even when I didn't touch anything in TBB or Vidalia, between the restarts when it worked & when it suddenly stopped working.
Couple times, it even prevented TBB from connecting to the network. Deleting Vidalia files & re-extracting them seemed to fix that (couple of times).
So far, I didn't notice anything odd in Vidalia config file, or in the torrc file at: \Tor Browser\Data\Tor.
I could easily have overlooked something.

I can't help much w/ determining if it was a "bad exit," but I can offer one way to see the exits in use.
That's one complaint about TBB 3.5 series - took away the ability to see a map of relays.
Though I personally had what seemed like "bugginess" w/ Vidalia, you can still get the stand alone version to use w/ TBB 3.5.
Vidalia-standalone-bundles_Index of /~erinn/ Best I can tell from sparse instructions, you just extract Vidalia files to a separate folder - created as sub-folder of TorBrowser folder.
You must Start Vidalia AFTER TBB (Tor) is already connected.  I didn't need to modify anything, anywhere to make Vidalia detect Tor & display the network map.
But, it also tends to crash (mess up), after a few TBB restarts (exiting Vidalia each time, before exiting TBB).
So it may not work flawlessly, long term.
Another option is copy the IPA shown on the Tor connection screen in TBB, then enter it into any IPA checking site - get the location, perhaps server name?
Also check if that IPA is on blacklists What Is My IP Address Blacklist Check

It probably won't allow 2 instances of Firefox (TBB) running at once.
You may be able to use the stand alone profile mgr for Firefox You'd have to add an entry in the profile mgr, to the location of TBB (firefox.exe).   So you can specify which Fx version to use w/ which Also have to create a new profile for TBB (in a location you choose), then launch TBB using that profile & do any modifications.
To use different TBB profiles, you'd have to launch the profile mgr each time (not a big deal).
Or, you could use the TBB / firefox ESR's native profile mgr, to create a 2nd, 3rd profile - perhaps? in same general location, but different Then you'd have to use one of the profile mgrs to select the profile to start each time.  Unless, most times you only use one - then it can be the default profile & only when needing a non-default profile would you need to start profile mgr to select that profile.
On any of these, it's a possibility you may have to manually edit profiles.ini (in Windows path:  Tor Browser\Data\Browser\profiles.ini.)

Please go to the MDN (mozilla) link I gave.  Like anything, there's some reading on how to use the profile manager, but it's child's play compared to using a browser.
They have online help section to use the utility (which doesn't need There's also an article in Mozillazine knowledge base on creating profiles.  If one can't read & master the steps needed to do this, maybe they might shouldn't be creating multiple profiles, esp. to use in TBB.  Just sayin'.
You use the menu options in the profile manager to create new profiles.  About a 10 sec. operation, once you know basic menu options.  In the same way the native Fx profile manager does.
The native manager would also work, it's just that the stand alone manager from MDN has more features, flexibility.  It's not difficult (unless one refuses to read simple instructions).
One thing:  The MDN profile manager (or Firefox) has a known bug - which doesn't really bother anything.
When the manager is used to open a profile that's previously been *opened* (but is now closed), it will show a message that the profile you selected appears to be in use & starting Fx with it could damage Unless Firefox IS running, with the profile SELECTED,  the profiles aren't open & starting them doesn't damage anything.
The only time that might be the case, is if you actually had a running instance of Fx / TBB; in which case you'd see it running in Task Manager or equivalent running processes monitor in other OSes.
As long as [the profile you've selected] isn't started / running, the warnings about it in Profile Manager can be ignored.

1) I doubt you'll be able to run > 1 instance of TBB - at once - if that's part of what you want.
Others can correct me, if wrong.
WARNING:  Be careful about what you modify in a TBB profile.  You could compromise your anonymity.
Making changes in about:config, etc., w/o *really knowing* how they might affect TBB's ability to preserve anonymity, could be risky.
If you tell us your main objectives are for multiple TBB profiles, maybe someone can make suggestions.  Possibly, "don't do it."  It depends.
Same for installing plugins, extensions.  They may not observe instructions to use only the Tor network / port. Or may affect anonymity in other ways.
Generally, the fewer modifications to TBB preferences / default options & the fewer extensions installed, the better.
2) "proxy server is refusing connections" probably has nothing to do w/ (any) profile manager.  It doesn't choose how to connect - it only opens a profile you select (either from existing ones, or new one(s) you create), and uses the file & path you specify, to which ever version of Fx you want to use.
It's possible that using profile mgr to start TBB, it bypassing the "start Tor Browser.exe" (or other files) & is causing some problem in That might be fixable, but I don't have time to play w/ it.
3) If you just want multiple TBB profiles, you could install TBB to a few different folders, then customize each one.
Start each TBB installation (w/ its own profile) by creating shortcuts for Start Tor Browser.exe, from each installation folder.
Again, some TBB modifications (say, to the UI) can make your copy of TBB look different than TBB with default settings, to sites that query, log & compare browser characteristics.  For purposes of developing a browser fingerprint so you can be identified later on the same site, or at other sites run by the same people, or that are monitored by tracking companies / "profile builders."

Yes, I discovered 2 (or more?) instances of Fx can be run.  Even for the same Fx .exe file / version, I can start one;
either clicking a shortcut or thru profile manager.  It allows me to start a 2nd instance, where I've mostly used profile manager.
The "-no-remote" command can also be used from Run (Windows) or command line / prompt.
This article explains different scenarios pretty well. NOTE:  under all scenarios, a different profile must be used for the 2nd, 3rd Firefox instance.  Or, you'll get a "Profile is already in use" In this case, the warning is valid - as the same profile is trying to be used by 2 instances.  That wouldn't work, as possible changes from each instance might try to make conflicting changes for the same prefs in same profile.  Thus, the warning.  That same error message in stand alone Profile Mgr (*when the selected profile is NOT already in use*) is a bug.  But if a selected profile WAS already in use, you wouldn't want to use it in another Fx instance.

@_subject: [tor-talk] General questions about Tor proxy 
I'm not avidly pro list or forum for something like Tor.  There are pros & cons, no matter what format is used.
Mailing lists aren't as user friendly to search old topics.  Yes, there's an archive.
It's not a friendly / easy to search as forums with (good) software.
Mailing lists (& email) are harder to follow on longer topics - where one wants to actually follow the entire thread.
On forums or similar layout, it's all laid out on one page (often can specify # of comments to a page).
In email, even in "conversation view," have to move from one response to next to next.
Sometimes, people top post or bottom post in mailing lists (no amt of reminders will ever change this).
In forums, the posting format is fixed.
It's much more difficult to quotes & use certain other formatting for the plain text mailing list messages (and keep the formatting easy to read).  Attachments or images aren't possible in plain text mailing lists (except thru links).
I know nothing about *difficulty of maintaining* mailing lists vs. forums.  I'd assume mailing list is easier.
However, many small (one man), open source freeware devs choose forums over mailing lists.
Probably because they think it's easier / more useful for many users - for various reasons.
Some small devs may make a little $ off adds on their sites (an incentive to set up forum), but many of them have few trackers on their sites, to deliver the ads;
many like that may barely break even.  But, I guess ? they think a forum is important enough to warrant it?  Not sure.
My guess is, a properly run, well-supported forum would attract more "avg" users to Tor.  It's a more familiar way for them to get help & self help.  One question is, w/ the current complexity* of the browser / network & support from a mailing list, will numbers of Tor users keep growing at fast enough pace to grow the network, so it will become easier to get lost in the crowd?
Continually adding large numbers of users likely means attracting avg technical capability users?
*IF* ... the decision is, Tor doesn't want / need avg users (for various reasons), so be it.
*Complexity:  Not in the installation or connecting to Tor network, but in correct browser use, so anonymity isn't blown.
Complexity of torrifying other apps, etc.  All the things that require more technical ability than most avg users have.
Yes, these things are easy to regulars here, or to programmers, etc.  Those types of things are Greek to avg users & the lack of a single, well laid out, up to date user / help manual will likely stop the vast majority of avg users from ever trying it.  Not belittling anyone - just observations, from having worked w/ many "avg users."
If ever there was a "seriously complicated, difficult & vitally important" software, that probably needs more support than a mailing list typically gives, it has to be Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] EFF "Who Has Your Back" report 
"Google looking good for privacy" is hilarious (comment not aimed at the Thanks for the links.  PBS' Frontline recently aired a very in depth, 2-part show on the NSA's general surveillance activities (&  other related issues) since the 9/11 attacks.  Best I remember, they didn't contain much new, ground shaking news (beyond what's been reported, over a long, drawn out period), but did a pretty good job at creating a timeline for who knew / said what, when.  It did show several powerful people, incl. NSA officials & U.S. president, lying like dogs to Congress & the press / American public.  Shows aired on PBS are often available online, for free.
A seldom mentioned fact is, even if companies aren't regularly "selling" user data to a gov't (they *absolutely* are selling it to other, non-gov't entities),  they often charge requesting LEAs large sums to gather & assemble the requested data (make reports). Some of the actual invoices for fees charged for these services are public (were released by the companies) & available for inspection.  I've seen invoices from say, major mobile phone providers, like Verizon, Sprint.  They aren't just getting "a few bucks to cover costs" when they gather the requested data & prepare reports; it is quite costly.
That income (from data requested in criminal proceedings or "National Security Letters", etc.) may be a small portion of their bottom line.
As Krishna mentioned, no one knows (yet) what other transactions may be occurring.  Some of Snowden's released NSA documents show that sometimes the NSA just takes (hacks, acquires, monitors... steals) what it wants for the Googles, Yahoos - so why pay large sums?  It would only make sense if paying the companies was far less expensive & faster, than secretly "borrowing" the data.  But if companies have an agreement to sell data, an agency like NSA must worry about secrecy (even if only a couple people at each company know about it).
If after the Snowden released documents, anyone thinks that the wildest imaginable "conspiracy theory" about any gov't activity isn't completely possible, there's something wrong.  (Some diehard "W" supporters still believed there were WMDs in Iraq, yrs into the Iraq war, despite massive intelligence to the contrary.  *"I've made up my mind, don't confuse me with facts."*
Soon, the public will forget(1) that Snowden exposed - as absolute truth, the formerly "crazy, conspiracy theories" about gov't surveillance (gov'ts all over the world possibly do the same things at varying levels).   Things previously thought to be *so impossible* w/ current technology, ...or so illegal / impossible to do under current laws & the constitution, that anyone suggesting them was immediately labeled a nut.  But everything imagined about secret gov't activities - & more - *beyond our wildest dreams, turned out to be fact.*
And, as incredible as everything that Snowden obtained is, it very likely only scratches the surface of all the surveillance & data gathering activies (same goes for other gov'ts).
Even so, any new theories about (any) gov'ts activities or capabilities will once again be labeled as conspiracy theories.
(1) Just as the illegal collection of internet data *did not stop* after the exposure - many yrs ago - of AT&T sharing it's internet traffic w/ NSA, the release of Snowden's documents won't stop most of the exposed programs & activities.  But avg citizens & a fair number of intelligent, suspicious citizens will believe (assume) that just because the activities & programs were exposed - using the gov'ts own documentation - that the activities will largely stop.
Why would anyone assume that the general internet surveillance stopped after Mark Klein, a former AT&T technician, 1st exposed it in 2004 - later confirmed by journalists & others?  Is it because that's what always happens when illegal gov't activities are exposed?  It shouldn't be, because their tactics often don't change, just because they were exposed.  Being exposed is a mere bump in the road, to a 500 lb gorilla, that "sleeps anywhere it wants."
Articles from *way back* in 2005 - 2006, on the initial claim of AT&T sharing internet users' data w/ the NSA.
  _Is the NSA spying on U.S. Internet traffic?_
  _SAN FRANCISCO AT&T OFFICE OPENED TO NSA SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM, former AT&T technician this week tells Washington DC lawmakers_
Note:  dozens of articles are available on internet, by reputable journalists reporting on this incident; and an official Congressional investigation into it.  All that was soon forgotten & *? SOMEHOW ?* Congress & the public were surprised at revelations of Snowden's documents.  Given the historical record of many world gov'ts in similar situations (in principle), *why was anyone surprised by the information in the Snowden documents?*

I haven't done testing to see what identifying data might be revealed (if any) by this, but for Youtube (& some others), if you copy the vid URL, even though Flash isn't active, then paste into VLC, SMPlayer, they usually play.
For Flash content, success of Flash vids on non-Youtube sites playing in VLC / SMPlayer  varies.  It often works for non-Flash or HTML5 content from other sites.
You can also play many vids right in TBB by editing the URL - replacing most everything between the base URL & the vid's ID string - with *"embed."*

Thanks.  1st trying to use HTML5 in TBB is easier, when it works. Except, there's not nearly the same amount of playback control & options as in decent, open source players.
VLC has option to set Socks & http / https ports plus many other network settings.  As many or more network settings as most any app.
Not sure if SMPlayer has such network settings - devs could answer that on their forum.
I assume those settings would keep VLC inside Tor network, but haven't confirmed it.  VLC devs would know.  If it doesn't, it's probably a bug & VLC devs would likely fix.
You can turn off other contact between VLC & home.  After all that, it's unlikely there's "there are tons of tracking stuff," but that still needs confirming, if absolute anonymity is needed when playing vids.

Thanks.  No, VLC probably shouldn't be doing that w/ YT.  When I have time, can post a question on their forum / file bug.
For others info:  Many / most vids seem to now play w/ HTML5 in TBB 3.6.
I do NOT know why, because don't use it that much, but a few times when I played vids on YT, using what I thought was HTML5 (flash set to "never activate" in addons mgr), I later found the flash executable running in background in Windows task mgr.  Even though I don't think these files are playing in Flash (w/o me realizing it), I'm concerned that the Flash files starting up could leak info.
Task Mgr shows 2 flash .exe files running in background, actually. AFAIK, none of the vids played used Flash.  I gave no permission to use Flash on YT, nor had to do anything other than click the link to vids' URL.  Once the vid URLs load, play starts automatically - don't have to click anything.
Flash is installed for rare use in regular Fx, but plugin is disabled there.  I assume Flash being installed in Windows (but not active in any browser) is how it shows up in TBB plugins.
Whatever causes the Flash files to start running in background after playing some YT vids, I don't think it's me.

So the ABP filter is to block cookie notifications?  Meaning, users have to already have cookie permissions set?  And for new sites, they must remember when sites don't load or work correctly (notices are blocked), it may be because cookies are required?   I guess that's OK, if users remember right away that blocked cookies are causing sites not to work.  Unless, they allow all 1st party cookies, by default?
Good idea - self destruct cookies.  But another addon... in TBB, no less?  I might try it in Fx - but I've already got enough (far fewer than many users).  Maybe some cookie mgr dev could add that (or has).  It's not in Cookie Monster.

Since a lot of sites need / want to make money off of advertising, it will surprise me if more sites don't start blocking Tor - for economic Probably "targeted advertising" - where the more info they have about you, your location, individual browser & system characteristics - the more that ad companies are willing to pay.
I imagine that advertisers don't consider TBB users as very "targeted" (where we're all *supposed* to look like each other) & they have no IPa, no geo location - not much of anything, really.
Some site owners are also "sharing" their registered users info, according to articles by various outlets - Wall St. Journal, being one.  Or, they just let the tracking / data gather companies put trackers on their site, then allow trackers to gather the data.
Sometimes a site may share only meta data & according to several articles I've seen, including direct comments or quotes from the "data mining" companies employees, they eventually want to be able to tie a person's browser / computer online with a real name & physical address & email address, along w/ any other interests, associations they can dig up.  I DON'T know what this Daniel guy is / isn't doing - maybe nothing But, you can apply the general data gathering, ad delivering, revenue generating process to other sites & see why some of them don't want any anonymous users - Tor or other.
Tor / TBB doesn't exactly lend itself to that business model.  Maybe some have heard, gathering personal data on internet users is now big business.  No?
Tor thwarts that objective.  The trackers (who pay many site owners) say, "We don't need no stinking Tor Browsers."

Never deviating.
There may not be any current, known exploits of this in Tor, but many things in Tor are built around randomness - for a specific reason.
On the other hand, what about destination sites that have only a few active Tor users at a given time.
Of course, their 10 minute circuits wouldn't have all begun at the same But of the Tor users on that site, if only one users circuits change at a specific time & continue to do so every 10 minutes, does that make them harder or easier to pick out of that specific crowd?

@_subject: [tor-talk] more sites requiring captchas from Cloudfare (using 
Using TBB, I've noticed a LOT more captchas in the last couple months - just to view the front page, or see the page linked from a search through StartPage or Ixquick.
Some of the same sites presenting captchas in TBB, I tested in Firefox (31, 32) & did not get a captcha.  But, I didn't repeat that test on hundreds of sites.
These captchas recently started appearing (more often) on all kinds of sites.   By far the most common name that pops up associated with this security is "Cloudfare," but also some others.
Aside from being forced to allow scripts in NoScript from Cloudfare for the captcha to work (or which ever one it is), it also seems to require allowing scripts from... Google.com.
No messages pop up on the captcha pages (which completely block seeing any content from original target site) that say Google must be allowed.
There aren't even messages saying "scripts must be allowed from Cloudfare" (or which ever one it is).
But if you don't allow scripts from the main "security" provider (such as Cloudfare), entering the captcha doesn't work.
If "Google.com" isn't also allowed, the captcha process usually isn't successful.  I don't routinely allow these - just as a test to see what was required.
Based partly on the Page Source, I assume the security company is using one of Google's APIs as part of the overall captcha process.
But, once you've allowed Google.com in NoScript (if you do), then it's "no holds barred."  I would think Google could then do pretty much anything.
Entering a captcha isn't the biggest issue (to me).  It's that you're forced to allow scripts from 3rd parties, which in addition to providing captcha service, could easily do lots of other things.
Most people (in any browser) don't allow 3rd party *cookies*, but on more & more sites we're forced to allow scripts from 3rd parties - which are potentially much worse than 3rd party cookies.
Some of the worst sites for requiring to allow scripts "from everyone & his brother" are many of the legitimate news sites.

So far, other than more & more sites are in the "information gathering business," I can't imagine that most sites where I've seen Cloudfare captchas would be anti-Tor.
Unless, information gathering has now become too profitable to let it slide by.  Since they don't get much info from Tor users, perhaps they just make the process irritatingly difficult.
Perhaps outside forces (read:  3 letter agencies) are putting pressure on some sites to discourage TBB use.
Yes, I've experienced most of the problems you mention.  Like (but not limited to), after I've done the captcha & successfully gained site access, sometimes (not always?) it'll ask me to repeat the captcha process.
That seems to often happen when changing pages (on the same base domain of the site).   Even with 1st party cookies enabled.
But it asking to repeat the captcha could also be from TBB's IP address changing??  Not sure.
Like oyvinds, usually as soon as I see the Cloudfare captcha page, I just close the tab & move on.  And that's what I'll continue to do.
If the sites using this have that much problem w/ spam, I do feel for them, but I also wish them luck in not driving most users away.
I suspect they (or 3rd parties) are getting more out of it than just preventing spam / bots.
I don't care if the site or captcha process is broken or not.  Aside from seeming to also require GOOGLE (which is enough to make me leave immediately), the process is too time consuming & doesn't work consistently - even when 1st arriving at the site & necessary js is enabled for required parties.
Sometime the captcha image is truly unreadable.  Sometimes refreshing the image results in equally unreadable ones.  Sum total:  Far too much hassle, even if it worked.

@_subject: [tor-talk] more sites requiring captchas from Cloudfare (using 
I know nothing about Cloudfare's "business model."  But, the old saying, "There's no such thing as a free lunch," is still true. Unless they're a philanthropic org., that gets all funding from donations & grants, they are making money somehow.  Leaving the most likely explanation for them providing a "free" service (similar to):  *Cloudfare makes money from user data on the site(s).*
They may / may not be able to get enough data from Tor users to make it worthwhile.  Thus, possibly the captchas for TBB, that often don't work, or requiring Tor users to repeat captchas, on the same site during SAME session.  Even when JS & cookies are enabled.
Cloudfare's captcha process could be buggy - accounting for some of the issues, but
(1)  They still can't operate w/o generating income.  They're not Santa (2) Captchas don't seem to be presented to Firefox users (definitely not EVERY time, as with TBB).
(3) They're also requiring that scripts be allowed from Google.com. And Google is NOT a philanthropic organization.
(4) A fact that must be accepted is, a lot of people & malicious "groups" do use TBB for spamming & all sorts of undesirable things.  Which sites must protect themselves against.
(5) Comments from Cloudfare's Nick Sullivan (or heads of any company or LEA) are basically worthless.  These people get paid to lie to protect their organization's interest.  They all *regularly lie* at Congressional hearings & in courts of law.  That's a fact. Sometimes they're caught telling bald faced lies, but usually nothing happens to Now, if Cloudfare *changes* how their captchas work & stop requiring JS then, it's just a lot of hot air.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Torrentfreak and Cloudflare 
Whether captchas provided by any company on any site are working or not is one matter.
To many users, the bigger issue (& getting bigger every day) is the large number of sites now requiring captchas when using Tor / TBB.
But from my limited testing (for the same sites), I rarely receive captchas in Firefox.  I can't remember the last time I got one using regular Fx.
All the captchas with TBB could be because the  IPa is often from a non-U.S. country - for those that are accessing U.S. sites.
It could be because many Tor IP ranges get blacklisted (temporarily) because of spam / unwanted activity.
And some sites may just not like Tor - for various reasons.
One thing is clear to me.  If the trend continues where a significant percent of sites require captchas for most Tor users, I'll stop using TBB for most browsing, where anonymity isn't absolutely critical.
Unless the captcha process becomes nearly flawless and also does NOT require allowing scripts or cookies from Google or the like (known It will become way too much hassle to deal w/ frequent captchas. Which is a shame, because Tor needs more users, doing general browsing to increase anonymity from a larger crowd.
One guess why captchas are increasing for TBB is after the Snowden documents, the number of TBB users obviously increased.  Many of those were good citizens just wanting better privacy & some were people that realized TBB was a way to hide their identity for undesirable activity (from websites' points of view).  There could be lots of other reasons.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB not caching ahead on Youtube 
Using TBB 3.6.5 in Vista x64.  Also have Fx 32.0.2 on same machine.
In regular Fx, a vid like J. Timberlake -  will cache WAY ahead of play.
In TBB, caching many videos barely keeps up, so videos often stutter.  Both TBB & Firefox are playing in HTML5.
There are default about:config cache differences in TBB & Firefox (no I have lots of free RAM, fast processor & plenty fast connection.
In Firefox, I usually disable disk cache completely & allow a fair amt of memory cache - due to speed difference.  It seems to work well.
I'm not so sure that the buffer lagging in TBB has to do w/ disk cache - as it should be plenty fast to play a vid on this machine w/ as much *free* RAM & CPU resources as I have.
As for Network buffer prefs, they seem to be the same default values in TBB & Firefox.  Firefox has 2 more "buffer" prefs than TBB.
Also streamed the same vid in SMPlayer w/ no lagging, but it's not using Tor relays.
Changing circuits (that showed high capacities) made no difference in video lagging.
Anyway, in TBB - BOTH disk cache & memory cache are enabled.
But TBB has no *"browser.cache.memory.capacity"* value, as Firefox has.   I  could add it, if necessary.
I temporarily disabled disk cache in *TBB* - no change in video buffer lagging, but then notice in about:cache, there is NO memory cache in use while a vid plays (& stutters).  The TBB memory cache size (allowed) shown under about:cache = 32,768 KiB.   I have more memory cache than that allotted in Firefox, but the fact that TBB shows no memory cache in use - even when disk cache is DISabled, is odd.
I don't think the following has anything to do with this, but to stop *TBB from crashing* repeatedly & showing "Fault Module Name:   d2d1.dll,"  I had to disable both:
gfx.direct2d.disabled = true
layers.acceleration.disabled = true
as mentioned in several places, like Those 2 prefs are NOT disabled in Firefox.
I can post the disk / memory cache & buffer prefs - for TBB & Firefox, if someone wants to check them.
Any suggestions what to check?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor browser won't become the standard one... 
Pardon me if I missed some comments & I'm rehashing.
I'm not too familiar w/ how W10 has changed doing some things.
But, sounds like you have 2 (really separate) issues / needs:
1) setting * some * browser as default in Windows
2) setting which application will auto open specific types of files, if you double click a file, or R-click - then "Open" - from context menu.
In TBB (and Firefox), there's an about:config entry:
In TBB, it appears to be  - False, by default.
If false, it appears to prevent TBB / Firefox from asking at startup, if you want to make it your default browser.
When I toggled "browser.shell.checkDefaultBrowser" to True, in TBB' next restart, it prompted me if I wanted to make it my default browser.
I didn't take action, so don't know if it'd work (worth a try). There are other ways to do this (for firefox), if this method fails.
Regular Fx has a setting in Options>General, if you want to make it default browser.  I don't see that setting in TBB 4.5.3 Options.
Setting which programs will handle specific type files:  Windows (at least, *before* W10) - you set this in:
Control Panel > Default Programs > then the link: "Associate a file type or protocol with a program."
Basically, once that link's clicked, you scroll the list of file types ( say, HTML).  Then chose the program to always open it - IF... it exists in the list.
Fairly straight forward, but you can use Windows Help or 100's of sites w/ instructions on how to do this, if you get stuck.
I imagine the reason when you create an HTML doc, it immediately gets a Chrome logo, is because in
Control Panel > Default Programs > "Associate a file type or protocol with a program," - Chrome is set to open HTML files.
You can try hilighting that  file type, then use the Change Program button on that screen.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB visited links color 
Visited links in TBB (4.0.3 and up).
Sorry, didn't find anything in or FAQs or in any filed bugs, about how TBB handles visited links turning colors.
Should TBB visited links turn color, or not - by design?
At 1st, no visited links were turning colors in TBB 4.0.3 - Win.
Checked & the pref: browser.visited_color;  was at default value.
I assumed links didn't turn colors either because of private browsing mode, or TBB modified to prevent links from turning colors.
To see if it was private browsing, I disabled that in Torbutton & restarted.
They still didn't change.   I re-enabled private browsing AND all 4 boxes are checked under Torbutton > Privacy tab (as is the default).
When restarted TBB again, links *did* change color (to default dark purple).
Re-checked Torbutton Privacy tab - all 4 options still checked.
After still another restart, links no longer turned color (private browsing still enabled in Torbutton).
Not sure what happened - wanted to make sure TBB is behaving as designed - if they should / should not turn color?
Side question:  I assume if TBB allows them to turn color, that it may not be wise to choose a non-default visited link color?
Not sure if sites could detect / query the color specified & see that it isn't the default purple?

Yes, default is purple.  That was a side question - not the main one.
I think problem you mention was an old one in Firefox.  For years, Mozilla disabled visited links from changing color due to a bug.
I think that was fixed, but doesn't mean that TBB design wants them to change color (for highest anonymity / least fingerprinting).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fox News bans my Tor Browser 
For me, TBB is sometimes blocked on sites where it generally is not.
My description here has worked on *some* sites, but fails on others.
Like,   & Startpage.  When they "block,"  those 2 sites usually give a captcha.
On those 2 sites (& a fair # of others) just clicking the "new identity" on tor button often removes the captcha, or other site access issues, if no captcha.
New identity sometimes fails to allow access - even on sites it normally works.  Maybe ? because of the geo-location of  new identity is near the old one; or new identity's IPa is also on a spam list, etc?
I still (sometimes) use Vidalia [1], - allows more quickly choosing a new identity w/ exit relays far from the one getting blocked.
Often, if clicking New Identity on TorButton doesn't solve a site access issue, selecting a exit in a much different geo-location solves it.
[1] I don't know that Vidalia is still considered "anonymity safe", in later TBB versions - like 4.02, 4.03.
COMMENTS on that?
On Cloudfront supplied captchas on sites, I still find that entering captchas or changing identities to be mostly unsuccessful.
Can someone explain about using the following methods -  mentioned earlier?

@_date: 2015-01-16 19:33:06
@_author: Joe Btfsplk 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Fox News bans my Tor Browser 
Yes, I'm sure Torbuttons' New Identity is more anonymous (safer) than And I use it.  But what I find happens - more than a few times, when a site doesn't like an Tor exit (it's IP, or it's location), using New Identity often selects another circuit *very* similar to the previous; often definitely in the same country & similar IPa to previous one.  When that happens, site still block Tor (fairly often).
UPSHOT:  When sites block or require captcha (captchas often don't work) from a geo-location or from a range of IPa's, clicking the New Identity button often doesn't fix anything.  But, I've found dozens or hundreds of times, it's not because the sites "block all Tor." It's because they block specific countries, IPs - or ranges of them.  Torbutton "New Identity" doesn't handle this very well, - from the aspect - of getting you connected to a site that blocked exits from specific countries.
I'm not sure of a better solution for this.
Just one example:  Say,   (or Startpage), requires a captcha.  Getting a new identity *often* doesn't remove the captcha requirement - but sometimes does.
I started looking at possible reasons why.  Using Vidalia (*ONLY* so I could see the circuit locations, IPa's, etc.).
It became clear, at times, that simply closing the existing circuit, then watching (in Vidalia)  the new circuit & exits - OFTEN in the same country, or had similar IPa,  still caused Ixquick (and MANY other sites) to still block or require captcha.  Captchas that may / may not work.
I notice the same thing using  "New Identity" button (while observing countries, relay names, IPs, etc. of the old & New Identity).
Repeatedly getting a New Identity often doesn't fix the blocking or presenting captchas.  On many sites.  I'm guessing it's often because the exit relay locations (countries) and / or IPa ranges, etc., are too close to the last one.
Often, if I Torbutton  new identities enough times in a row, that through ? luck of the draw?,  the exit relay geo-location and / or IPa range changes significantly, the sites then work fine.  Five successive, new identities - all w/ exits in "XYZ-stan(s)" countries may never allow access to a site.  Then work  immediately on getting an exit in Germany, US.  (Note:  I'm not biased against relays base on their country - but the sites blocking them are.)
Thanks for link / info on TrackHostExits & AllowDotExit.
Reading those command descriptions, sounds like they're useful mainly if you "must" access a site w/ Tor, but don't care so much about anonymity?
Which may be acceptable, depending on one's reason for Tor - on a given site.  Just as long as a user knows the risks.

@_date: 2015-01-18 20:38:26
@_author: Joe Btfsplk 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Fox News bans my Tor Browser 
From what I've seen on many sites, including Ixquick / Startpage, is their presentation of captchas is VERY much related to the specific IP and / or the specific exit relay country.  Once those are changed (manually - by me) to say,
1) an IPa (or range) that isn't on some black list - or ones they've just had more than usual problems with, in the past, or
2) a country they don't have a lot of problems from,
they don't present captchas.  Those captchas *require* JS, so you must enable, even if want to solve the captcha.
On MANY sites, even w/ JS enabled, the *captchas don't work.*
Upshot?  By waiting around for Tor / TBB to change the circuit by itself, you may wait a hell of a long time, to get on a site, that (often) works fine w/ TBB, if you use the "right" country & a clean IPa.
So what do you do, especially when the captcha doesn't work (assuming you don't mind enabling JS)?  Wait for 10, 30, 50 min., for Tor to - maybe - build a circuit, using a country (or IP range) that a site hasn't "blacklisted?"  But, there's no guarantee (I've seen) that Tor will ever build a circuit any time soon, that doesn't use a country that's objectionable to the site.
Again, unless I just decide to wait hours, days to connect to a site that's balking at a specific exit relay country (or IP range), I just manually close the circuit, until it stops using eastern european exits, etc.  Then the sites usually connect fine.  I really don't want to have to do that, but unless I want to wait forever to connect to some sites, it's the only way I've found.
Many of the sites don't give captchas, or any message, when they see a country or IP they don't like.

Thanks.  Yes, I've gotten the "house numbers" (4 digits) - many times.
They're very legible, but still don't work (TB 4.5.1 / 4.5.2 - Windows).
When I enter them, Cloudfare doesn't give any message, just a new captcha image.
Sometimes, it shows another 4 digits - still clear.  Then another & another.
After a few times, it may switch to the letters on an acid trip.
Even when I can read all the letters, it still doesn't take.
After the 1st attempt or 2, it also may change the instructions to a non English language.  I assume based on exit relay location.
In Firefox, I can usually get similar looking captchas to work - especially if it's not from Cloudfare.
Which "out of the box browser" do you mean?  I've tried clean installs of TB before w/ default settings.
Don't remember having any better luck w/ Cloudfare.
To get it to work, are you allowing 1st and / or 3rd party cookies - for both the target site & whatever the URL is for the Cloudfare captcha page?
I wonder if the OS makes a difference to Cloudfare?
I think it may be (or used to be so).
IIRC, in Firefox, if NoScript wasn't set to allow all scripts (possibly 1st & 3rd party), sometimes I couldn't see all elements on the captcha page.

Just to clarify (to all that replied) - I have JS enabled.  At least, when trying to get captchas to work.
Then, I'm using Tor Browser's default settings for NoScript.
I just tried a couple of sites w/ Cloudfare.
Today, it worked, but not on the 1st try - even with legible house numbers.
But today I also checked the exit relay country, when it worked.  It was in a "well behaved" European country.
Other times when Cloudfare didn't work, I didn't always think to check, to see if there's any pattern to Cloudfare not working & specific exit relay countries.
FYI - for others, when using _vanilla Firefox_ & AdBlock Plus (or similar), Cloudfare doesn't like it.  Even if NoScript is set to allow all scripts.
Maybe because of blocking ads, but also maybe because ABP blocks some scripts.  Depending on the target site, some of those may be 3rd party scripts (for CDNs, or....) that Cloudfare requires to be allowed, before they'll allow the captcha to work.

Thanks for the helpful replies.
Is that actually true?  (they can track you over various exits)
Is that what the design document says? But, many Tor Browser users  seem to question allowing all scripts by default - including 3rd party.
For browser / computer security, as much as anything.
As I understand (roughly paraphrasing), the thinking on allowing JS is,
- many sites won't work fully (or at all) without JS.  Certainly, captchas won't.
- if all users have JS enabled, no one stands out.
- Tor Browser design protects against privacy (possibly anonymity) issues like cross domain tracking.
On the _latter point_, I'm not as technically advanced as many on this list, to fully understand ALL subtleties in the design document.

OK, but how is that a "business" for an exit relay?  Business implies profit or gaining some benefit.
You're saying that some exit relay operator would form business partnerships with sites, to provide captcha services?
Wouldn't that be detectable to the Tor Project - or not?
Does it make sense that an operator would limit their captcha service (for sale), to sites - only if site users / customers came thru the few relays they control?  Not much of a market.
Isn't that like Cloudfare only offering their services to a few sites out of the entire web?

Thanks ?a??l,
I'll have to ponder some of your comments.
On other points, some highly advanced users may have to jump in & comment.
On certain points you made (it seems), it's absolutely trivial for Cloudfare or any entity operating on a large number of sites, to track Tor / TBB users - across domains - on every site visited, that the tracking entity also monitors?
That assumes and / or implies several things (in Tor Browser).
1. You allow cookies AND 3rd party cookies, on many / most sites visited.
2. You rarely clear those cookies.
3. You never clear browser cache, except at shutdown.
4. You rarely, if ever, use the TBB new identity feature, during a single session.
5. TBB allows other non-cookie tracking methods (beacons, what ever) to be set AND allows them to be read *across all domains visited.*
On  did I misunderstand the TBB design document, and misunderstand the discussion that Mike Perry (I believe) had on this list, about cross domain tracking not being allowed?
6. A multi site tracker (CDN, Google, NSA) can read TBB all cached content.  Or, perhaps only the cached content that they set in TBB (but across all domains)?
If everything you say is true (if I understand), then any major tracker can know most of the sites you've been to & exactly what you did at each one (because of the cross domain tracking that TBB allows - by design)?
They *only* thing they don't know (yet) may be  your real IPa?
It sounds like you're not just saying there are *some* possible ways for cross origin tracking, but that much of the Tor Browser design document regarding this has no validity?

I don't have the answer.
Just thinking out loud.  e.g.,  when less experienced users don't understand a warning.
Guessing if users haven't read how making certain changes to TBB can make them stand out, they may think that message doesn't apply to them.
The Tor documentation page that says, " Be sure to read the list of warnings  about ways you can screw up your anonymity," (  I don't see mention of dangers in changing certain TBB default settings.  Nor do I see it in the Yes, at bottom of the list of warnings page, it says, "This list of pitfalls isn't complete."
AFAIK, there's not a concise list of most pitfalls, that new users could quickly scan.
Many other TBB changes to Firefox are much harder to change back, than clicking a still a functional part of the main TBB interface.
Maybe info should be added on the warning / FAQ or other pages - concisely listing changes that users generally don't want to make, then a link added to the TBB window resizing warning message?

1.  AFAIK, Startpage has always "been Google" - just private.  And SP / Ixquick don't try to present the results at top of list - they think you'd be most likely to buy from.
Google's been accused many times of showing results _they_ want you to see, not necessarily what you want to see.
What type results Google "gives" to SP or Ixquick when they query Google - don't know.
One could do tests - same search in Google, then immediately in SP - or any other that scrapes Google.  This has been done many times.
2.  Ixquick.com *(USA servers)* is now exactly same as Startpage.com or vice versa - both scrape Google.
* Neither reports anything to Google, _nor which links you follow_ - if "Post" method is selected - by default in SP / IxQ settings.
* Both also offer proxy browsing of search hits thru their servers. If using regular browsers & don't want sites or ISP to see searches "impotence treatment" from your IPa.
* Both offer option for SP / IxQ to search only European servers - or others - exclude US servers.
* Neither logs anything, including IPa, search terms or followed links;
* Neither requires java script or cookies (for default settings searches);
3.  The address - Ixquick.eu - they say *still uses meta search.* Still same privacy policy.
Oddly (kind of), Ixquick.eu only gives choices of searching EU AND N. American servers, or including engines outside those areas.
You can customize search & results *Settings*  prefs for all these -  clicking the 3 horizontal line icon - in top, left page corner - looks like Fx Menu / Customize icon.  Then save those settings by:
- a cookie
- a URL (plain or obfuscated) - use as bookmark
- create & install an obfuscated custom search plugin (shows like all others in Firefox search mgr), AFTER the URL's been created.  Shows up as "Ixquick (or Startpage) Custom Search".
Ixquick says it makes $ by users clicking on a few "sponsored" search results - at the top or bottom of search results.

Yes., what about it?  Sounds similar to other privacy conscious search engines, but most documentation on their site is in German. Very little I saw was in English.
They do say, "IP addresses are neither recorded nor stored, and user information is not passed on to other search engines."  But that's about it.
"MetaGer does not operate any servers outside of Germany and so falls exclusively under the privacy of the famously tough German data protection laws."
Are German data protection laws famous or tough?  Tough on whom - protecting individuals' privacy, or tough on catching criminals?
"The goals of SUMA-EV are also described in the statutes (currently available in German only), and in the 22 Theses of SUMA-EV. "
To me, the "22 Theses" read a bit like idealized philosophy vs. any legal Privacy Policy or Terms of Service.
Maybe  someone could find their privacy policy or TOS in English - or an accurate translation that some users might have to bet their freedom on.
I tried a search on MetaGer's English page - 'mozilla* firefox profile contents'.  It returned only 15 hits.

Are you saying using TBB, cloudflare sets cookies withOUT either
checking "accept cookies from sites;"
or entering an exception for their domain in TBB's cookie exceptions;
or when in Options > Privacy - "Accept 3rd party cookies" = Never?
If I don't set "accept cookies" & select "never allow 3rd party cookies", and don't enter a domain in cookie exceptions, I don't get (seems the "Exceptions" Privacy option should be called "Permissions," same as the profile file containing them - "permissions.sqlite."  They didn't consult me on the UI.
You don't have a cookie manager addon installed, do you?  Maybe changing TBB default behavior.
Even if I check TBB - "Accept cookies from sites", on restarting TBB, it unchecks that box (by design).
For TBB (Firefox) - Tools > Options > Privacy - what I don't understand is why TBB allows "Accept 3rd party cookies" to be reset to "Always," when you check "Accept cookies?"
Then it also *unchecks* / *over rides* the Torbutton Privacy & Security Settings - "Restrict 3rd party cookies & other tracking data" - and then definitely allows 3rd party cookies.
It probably shouldn't.  Doesn't this allows tracking _during_ the session?  True, 1st & 3rd party cookies & exceptions are deleted on restarting TBB.
If users check allow cookies in TBB - Firefox Options, TBB probably should prevent 3rd party cookies from automatically resetting from "Never" to "Always."
Especially when Torbutton's Privacy setting is checked to restrict 3rd party cookies.
Seems the only way Torbutton settings should be allowed to change is from Torbutton UI.

If it gets to the point where it's common knowledge to every hacker how to even partially misuse the ME, then Intel will have made a grave business decision.  At that point, they'd have to discontinue it, perhaps give refunds for unusable computers or issue permanent fixes - to close the holes.

It may show some 3rd party domains under Untrusted (but not MARKED as untrusted), that don't show in the main list.

Never mind.  The last NoScript 2.9.5.2 update included in TBB 6.08 over rode some of my settings.
It changed the option "Allow HTTPS scripts globally on https documents" from unchecked to checked.
Normally, updating addons in Firefox doesn't change previous users' custom settings.  Nor does updating Firefox change users' previous custom settings.
I had probably already updated NS to 2.9.5.2 before TBB 6.08 came out and that setting wasn't enabled.  A BU of NS settings before TBB 6.08 confirmed this.
I suppose we have to export settings for all addons *included* in TBB, before upgrading TBB.  Then restore each addon's backed up settings - if they have that option.
Caveat to this - there may be new or modified options in TBB included addons, where restoring settings from previous addon versions may mess things up.
The other choice (like here) after every TBB update is, spend hrs going thru every option page of every included addon - verify every setting - until you find the change that's causing you issues.  I don't have time for that.
In this case, when it enables "Allow HTTPS scripts globally..." it allows every 3rd party script known to man.  Even ones with bad reps, if they're on an HTTPS site - with or w/o a site's permission or knowledge.  (sites never get hacked)

Looking at the BU of NS settings just before the TBB 6.08 update, it's clear I had "Allow https scripts globally" disabled.
And I definitely didn't recently change that option manually- no reason to.
But right after updating TBB 6.08 & noticed no scripts blocked on https sites, I did a NS settings BU before uninstalling NS.  That settings BU showed the pref was enabled.
So I don't know how else it got changed, except by NS or TBB update process.
Since the default NS setting for this is disabled, not sure  how. The TBB "extension-overrides.js" file doesn't include this pref to override NS default.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What is "cookie protections"? 
In Windows TBB, there's a selection "Use custom settings for history."
The "Remember my browsing & download history" are handled separately from "Accept cookies" (separate check box).
At shut down, TBB deletes all site preferences (Exceptions) & cookies, regardless if those are unchecked in "Clear history when Tor browser closes" settings.  So that no data is saved across sessions.   If you want to selectively delete cookies mid session, you'd have to do it manually -  (or use various cookie mgr or cache & cookie mgr addons, which isn't recommended by Tor Project). Unless just using TBB for the added safety, not maximum anonymity - then using (certain) addons probably isn't a super bad thing.
I'm not sure (now days) the possibility of some sites sharing data from SESSION cookies.  In the old days, 1st party cookies couldn't be read / used by other sites.  Unless maybe if 2 sites were owned by same people.
In Firefox & TBB, if check "accept cookies," the "accept 3rd party cookies" is automatically checked.
But, TorButton has checked by default, "Restrict 3rd party cookies & other tracking data," so it probably ? overrides 3rd party cookies being enabled in the TBB Options > Privacy screen.
Then I'm not sure why TBB automatically check the 3rd party cookie box, if "Accept Cookies" under Privacy tab is checked, if the TorButton is set to prevent 3rd party cookies.  It's confusing (I don't think it Short of using addons to save cookie exceptions or cookies between sessions, one could store cookie exceptions in a separate permissions.sqlite file - in another location.  If paranoid, encrypt it -  then decrypt it & copy to the TBB profile before launching TBB.
   In Windows TBB, I don't see settings called "Cookie Protections."

1.  Wasn't this discussed back when it occurred?  As to how they did (or likely did) identify the Tor / Tor Browser users for the porn arrests?
Or am I thinking of bringing down Silk Road & some other sites?
2.  Aren't statements (from anyone) like, "... generally crack the servers hosting the illicit material, not Tor itself," sort of a matter of semantics?
e.g., on clear net, a plain Firefox user browses to a trusted site that's been hacked (& might be detectable, if anyone was checking).  The browser has no defense against the specific attack, though addons (say, NoScript) are aware of the possibility.
So the site / server was attacked 1st, but that's not the goal.  Due to weakness in (any) browser, isn't it as much an attack against the browser as the site?  And just as much the browser devs' faults for not fixing the weakness - if possible, and / or not repeatedly, very visibly warning users in unmistakable language  - if they don't do so.  In many cases, the discussion becomes, "Was it Firefox's fault or Tor Browser's, for not fixing the Firefox weakness?"
Not many realistic people I know would expect the producer or distributor of a product to *continually* point out the shortcomings, if they expected to retain or increase users.  (They might like for this to happen, but don't realistically expect it to).  Especially when the producer & distributor won't be legally liable for anything, if they don't constantly warn users. There's no penalty for software devs - esp. not freeware.   There usually are certain warnings or known issue comments from software devs, but often fairly obscure to average users.  If Tor Project - or any other developer - repeatedly splashes weaknesses on page 1, it could seriously decrease users.
With software, lose-weight-while-you-sleep pills or OTC drugs, not all users necessarily understand the warnings, even if they hear / read them.  Often because they're ambiguous or don't give enough details or aren't worded so that average people understand.  And / or some users have a "it'll never happen to me" mentality.

Thanks Jon.  I agree w/ most that you said.  Again, semantics. Whether they cracked Tor or Tor Browser won't change if the brutal dictator has you shot in the front or back of the head. :)
Unless one is using Tor w/ their own internet browsing application, an exploited weakness in Tor Browser - modified Firefox - has the same effect on users.  They're a package deal.
If claiming, there are no known cases of authorities "cracking Tor" or using its weaknesses to deanonymize users, that may be correct, AFAWK.  But, it's been shown time & again, "we" don't know very far regarding what  gov'ts & their agencies can / can't do, or have / haven't done.  An unfortunate fact for citizens everywhere. "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence," as to their capabilities.  If any government cracks Tor, it'll be of the highest security classification.  Most advanced governments aren't as bungling & clueless as many think they are.
True - if someone cracked Tor, this show is over - for a while.  To Prisoner Number Six, it makes no difference if the chink was in Tor proper, or in the browser.  It matters to Tor Project for ego & bragging rights & it matters regarding whether only a few unlucky freedom fighters got caught, or if Tor needs a complete overhaul.
You're not really suggesting that users under hostile dictatorships or ones trying to expose democratic government unconstitutional actions,  take full responsibility for the ongoing modifying, patching & constant reading about weaknesses of Tor Browser "for their own security?"
That Tor Project is saying Tor is relatively anonymous; as for Tor Browser, everyone's on their own.
If one is in the right (or wrong) situation, anonymity = security. Lack of anonymity may = jail or death.  Not for me & presumably not Tor developers, but for some users that Tor was designed for.

Respectfully, you're dreaming if you think whistle blowers, political activists or citizens under brutal regimes are *necessarily,* or even mostly computer geeks. :)
You may be correct that only very advanced geeks or (sane) persons w/ unlimited access to one, _should_ use TBB in dangerous situations, if they don't understand every detail about what can go wrong & how to fix it themselves.
Very few people meet those criteria.  I don't  & I've been studying Tor & TBB for yrs.   People that might have interests in whistle blowing or activism, *also* having the knowledge & ability to troubleshoot, modify or patch TBB on an ongoing basis are almost nil.  Except for those w/ no concept of the extreme risk they're taking, that leaves very few people to do any blowin' or activatin'.   People under brutal regimes don't need to be activists to have a real need for reliable anonymity (no unpatched browser bugs).  They just need to safely access info besides governmental propaganda or to pass info to similar minded persons.  Do we think they're all going to be coders that can patch browsers?  That's a dream.  :)
If the only people (in dangerous situations) that should use Tor / Tor Browser are geeks, it doesn't have a very wide audience. Regardless of whose job it is to make something like TBB "as secure as possible," there just aren't many people like E. Snowden w/ extreme computer talent - to do what you're suggesting -  & desire (possibly stupidity) to go after top officials or their government.
Many of things mentioned in "what else you need to remain anonymous" type articles - don't use Flash, plugins, file sharing, etc., are easy.  It's all the other things that can go, or are, wrong that most people wouldn't understand.  For years, Tor devs weren't even sure how to report TBB screen size & many other unresolved issues.  I filed various bugs on many things, but had no idea how to fix them.   How can even advanced users be expected to fix these & more problems when it sometimes takes extremely talented Tor devs years to find solutions?  Again, a pipe dream.
The sage advice under "List of Warnings:"  "Ultimately the best protection is a social approach: the more Tor users there are near you and the more diverse  their interests, the less dangerous it will be that you are one of them."  L I'll B.  Unless sites you're visiting  or your exact ISP server are known to have 100's of TBB users - at once, that doesn't help I'm not too sure about trusting one's life to a system based in part on pure guesstimating how many entry & exit relays are enemy controlled.  Calculating statistical odds of being identified, based on unknown of numbers of enemy controlled nodes; the number of times & frequency entry guards change, number of sites visited, etc. :D

Huh?  Did I miss something?  As of late, I haven't noticed CF captchas disappeared, or worked any better in Tor Browser.
Are you talking about a special case?
Sometimes, in Firefox on the same site I may not get any captcha, a few minutes after trying a couple of times in TBB.
If it's a trustworthy site (if there's such a thing) & JS is allowed for all necessary 3rd parties on the site, the captchas will either work in the 1st 1 or 2 tries in TBB, or they won't at all.
And in Firefox, where I have a lot of blocking addons, it almost always works w/ JS allowed on just the base domain.

I'm far from an expert, but is this the best idea, in general?
It's been said, don't run an exit node from your own house / computer / personal server - for safety reasons (I think).
If they / s/he created an exit node "at home" & allowed other traffic thru it, they could be asking for trouble when someone does illegal things thru their node & LEAs come knocking (maybe not even knock - do they have to knock at least once - these days?)
Or were you (TF) suggesting  s/he blocks all traffic thru the node except their own (assuming all they want is encryption)?
I don't think Tor Project would allow that, would they?  Wouldn't think they should - defeats the intent & "spirit" of using Tor network, doesn't it?
And now for everyone's pleasure, I'd like to present a Novella, "The Coder Did / Did Not Do It," based on the fictional character, Bake Jpplebaum.  Any resemblance to any person, place or thing, living or dead, is purely coincidental.
Seriously, have you ever noticed how "media" stories  appealing to more prurient interests generate far more interest & public input than stories about say, someone saving a child from burning building?
And if someone - anyone - is convicted of anything in the media before the trial begins - front page or lead story, if the person is exonerated, rare apologies are often buried deeply or mumbled in the last seconds of broadcasts?
And how (many, not all) people tend to believe the worst about most accused persons, regardless of the lack of or thinness of evidence, much less waiting for any legal process?  An interesting but not necessarily admirable human trait.
If the accused is a different race than ourselves, it's often worse.   Some people see an accused's face on TV (no evidence yet) & say, "Oh yeah, you can tell s/he's guilty, just by looking." Wow!  Really?  I hope they're not on my jury of "peers" if I'm ever accused.
Everyone knows if after the 1st accuser, several people come forward with the sometimes uncannily same story, it must be true - right? If several people - adults or 5 yr old children from a day care, all say the same thing,  it must be true?  That's a definite... maybe & maybe not.  There've been *numerous cases* of "mass eye witness testimonies" turning out to be false, for various reasons. No secret.  Many have been high profile, but again, when the accused were exonerated, there was little fanfare.  Is Jake guilty of anything "criminal?"  DON'T know.  I do know that no one deserves to be tried in the Court of Public Rumors & Unsubstantiated Statements.  Not Bill Cosby, or rock stars or an inner city kid on welfare.
I especially like this quote: "Just because someone says something confidently doesn't mean it's true." - Elizabeth Loftus, Why would several people, gender aside, come out one after another with the same story, if it weren't true?  Several reasons, from what I've read & seen from pretty respectable, unbiased researchers & experts studying this phenomenon.  All of them except one, have nothing to do with the truth.  Sometimes seeking money, fame, notoriety, revenge, a chance to write a book or sell movie rights to their story, being coached, psychologically manipulated / power of suggestion by investigators or police psychologists.  Sure, the publicly accused are often guilty (or found so) & sometimes they're proven not guilty  by hard evidence - not just hung juries or because of technicalities.
One of more notable mass accuser testimony cases that turned out to be false testimony was Kern County, CA child abuse cases. I remember it.  Other "day care hysteria" cases followed this one. Apparently, some 60 small kids testified they'd been abused.  SIXTY WITNESSES.  36 or so people were convicted - most spent years  in prison, before MOST ALL were overturned.  Apparently the kids had been coached (according to appeal courts) & several social workers involved had recently attended training that included a popular book on sex abuse in satanic rituals.
Again, how can a lot of people giving the same testimony be wrong or worse, lying?  Apparently it's not that hard.
The Innocence Project  has exonerated a lot of wrongly convicted people that served time, often using DNA evidence.  Many others have been exonerated w/o the Project's help.  Many of these people were convicted on spoken or eye witness testimony of "absolutely positive" witnesses or air tight evidence.  Yet years later, DNA evidence showed someone else committed the crime.
Here's a short list of well known wrongful convictions - majority exonerated or released after new evidence or trial. In recent years, many studies seem to show that human eyewitnesses are often wrong, even if they sincerely believe they are correct. Many convictions based on "credible" eyewitnesses have been overturned, after new evidence is discovered, DNA is used, others confess to the crime, etc.  Apparently, it's frighteningly easy to be wrongfully convicted, if you don't have money for a really good attorney.

That's true.  Those are colloquialisms, adages - not laws of physics.  The mentality behind those sayings you mentioned are exactly why many  see a mug shot on TV & immediately conclude they're guilty w/ no evidence or hearing a word from the accused. Most developed countries have a legal system to determine guilt / innocence.  Definitely imperfect, but most scholars would say far superior to trial by media or the internet - guilty until proven innocent.
Yet thousands of times, people are arrested, charged - their face & accusations plastered everywhere, even convicted - later found they weren't even in the town / state when crime occurred, or hard evidence proves others committed the crime.  In spite of ALL those documented cases, a large % of population still immediately assumes people are guilty when arrested, or just publicly accused.  We never seem to learn from mistakes.  Once we hear / see something, it sticks.
USA Today poll in 2003 showed, " *Nearly seven in 10 Americans believe it is likely that ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was personally involved in the Sept. 11 attacks*." USATODAY.com - Poll: 70% believe Saddam, 9-11 link A *2014* survey by Fairleigh Dickinson University’s research center, PublicMind, showed, "of the 964 adults who were sampled in the national phone survey, 42 percent said that it was "definitely" or "probably" true that American forces found an active weapons of mass destruction program in Iraq."   Weapuns of mass de-strucshun; nuc-u-lear bombs, huh?
When a prurient or gruesome story breaks, media sensationalizes the undocumented, unproven accusations.  If later found untrue, it's barely mentioned.  Almost never discussed how their reputation was ruined, lost their job / family, used life savings on legal fees, because it doesn't appeal to the "general public's" baser interests.  If the general public WAS interested in it, media would run it.
There are scores of documented cases of persons or groups making extremely serious, false, public claims or filing frivolous lawsuits against individuals or corporations - later proven undeniably false.
The many examples from The Innocence Project & Wikipedia - wrongly convicted persons  - barely scratch the surface.   People that tear themselves away from The Bachelor or Duck Dynasty & have read psychiatrists &  experts discuss this  in detail - understand the trauma, immense burden & often financial ruin that the falsely accused or convicted & their families endure.
I personally knew 2 teachers (separate incidents) accused by *multiple* students of sexual misconduct (so it had to be true, right?).  On nothing but uninvestigated claims, they were arrested, booked, faces & story on TV / papers, one fired.  In both cases -  investigators and / or teachers' lawyers THEN found it was all fabricated & students fully admitted they made it all up. Before ever going to trial.  "Sorry."  One was for revenge for "low grades given."  AFAIK, nothing happened to the students - old enough to know what they were doing.  One teacher said it cost much of their life savings hiring attorneys, because they couldn't risk poor defense by public defenders.  There's no way they could mentally stand teaching again, even if they paid them 4 times their salary.
I've been told (not researched it), in some countries if you file a (civil?) lawsuit against someone & lose, you may be  responsible for their reasonable legal fees?  Perhaps damages, too?  You can't just make any claims you want w/ impunity.  Throw it against the wall & see what sticks (as in the U.S. & some countries).

Thanks.  Very sincere questions arise - is the reason Tor / Tor Browser doesn't / hasn't change(d) yet to counter the worst of threats - often large players or states controlling or monitoring too much of the network, mainly because of difficulty of coding the changes - meshing w/ rest of the code?  I truly appreciate what Tor Project does, but if I lived in a hostile state, I'd be afraid for my life to use Tor Browser.
* Or, are solution(s) deemed "good enough" typically difficult to conceive, much less implement?
* BEcause large nations have massive brain power & almost limitless funds?
* A lack of Tor man power (lack of funds), brain drain to the NSA / FBI; kibosh by the navy on changes?   Or several, or other reasons?
We've read for many years now, how countries - or cooperating countries -  devoting enough time & money may well de-anonymize some or many users, depending.
I posed that question / theory many yrs B.S.  (before Snowden) & I know relatively little about *fine* details on packet timing, etc.  I'm not a coder.  (That idea was shot down __immediately & decisively__ by Tor mgmt). :)
Yrs later, we're still talking about same exact problem(s) - some improvements, several of which many advanced users & "researchers" say may still be woefully inadequate.  That we're "whistling past the Note:  "Just because someone says something repeatedly with conviction, doesn't make it true."  For anyone.

Not that LEAs or pro Big Brother politicians (world wide) care, but is there any difference in mass surveillance of electronic surveillance w/o probably cause, and *mass* listening to citizens in their homes w/o probable cause, using powerful microphones?  They could mount unmanned, directional listening devices on utility poles (where exist), or make new TVs, light fixtures, etc., w/ hidden cameras / microphones & listen to as many as they want "just to be safe."
There's literally no end once any countries start violating their constitutions, which was & is constitutional experts' concern over mass monitoring & logging of internet, email, private voice communications.  People "blame" the NSA & other 3 letter orgs, but w/o any nation's political system's approval of funds, these agencies couldn't exist or do what they're doing.  Many can understand them wanting to decrypt or de-anonymize devices of known criminals' or prime suspects; then  prosecute.  But not gather intel on everyone just because they can.  Some on this list probably never completely read Orwell's __1984__ (futuristic when I 1st read it).  They'd be surprised at its many almost identical similarities to what has transpired.
So really, in democratic / free election countries, it's a majority of officials elected to "do the will of the people" that are allowing these agencies behavior.

Seems that saying "the decision is bad news for privacy" is an historical understatement.  It's more like burning the Constitution & shooting the ashes out of the solar system.
"We don't need no stinking warrant."
I have doubts that sending scolding emails or petitions will in any way change minds of the powers that be, intent on ignoring the Constitution.
It may be the type situation that needs boots on the ground to bring change.  People in significant numbers aren't willing to do that, pure & simple.  Too many good shows on TV or fun computer games.
Questions in general:
1) Is anyone aware of court rulings or scheduled for a vote - in the U.S. or other "free" nations, saying citizens in their homes, not named as suspect in any particular crime & with no warrant issued, have no reasonable right to privacy - _in general_?  (IOW, the Constitution is invalid).   I don't see why it should stop with computers, other than maybe no laws exist that explicitly include personal computers under right to privacy?
2) Does that ruling or any related documents claim no right to privacy, if reading documents on a computer - not transmitted over the internet and / or not using any public network; even electronic book readers; which TV shows are watched, radio stations tuned in? Or is it only if you "go on the public internet?"
3) Meaning for example, authorities could use various technologies to monitor & record *face to face* conversations of persons not named as suspects in any crime (esp. felonies)?
4) What about privacy for communications between *citizens* of free nations & their medical doctors, lawyers, clergymen, etc, whether or not using "encrypted / anonymous" methods; that took place entirely inside your home, in their office or by any form of communication, including postal mail?
Or privacy for computer stored, hand typed notes on doctor / lawyer / clergy conversations (NOT transmitted over the internet)?  In that case, is there any difference between storing it on a computer or in a journal in a desk drawer?
Some of this type data might be excluded in court trials - or not, unless persons are declared "enemies of the state".
5) What about written, photographic or sound recordings - not stored on a computer?
Why not INCLUDE landline / cell telephone, VOIP, postal mail, personal hand written or typed notes, conversations between spouses in the types of records or info not requiring warrants?

There've been plenty of list discussions on legal, security & privacy issues in other countries.

Actually, I just noticed it's in Firefox, also.  Never noticed it. If it's been like this, surely I'd notice part of the address was so light to barely be readable on the standard TBB URL background color?
When 1st paste -or type - an address in URL bar - before hit enter, the whole string is consistently dark & readable.
* Once (any) page loads, then only the base 2nd level domain is "normal" dark text & all else turns very light gray.
So, after loading, only 'stackexchange.com' part is readable unless I For  only 'mozilla.org' is dark after page loads.
If click outside the bar, then click back on it - once (selects entire address - hilights blue), then click the bar again (deselects address - removes blue hilight), then entire address becomes dark again.
But once I click outside the bar again, only 2nd level domain is dark.
I'm not sure if it'd be a good idea in TBB to change the CSS style so the entire URL string is always the same darkness.  If sites can detect style changes in text boxes?
I was once told not to change the default TBB browser font style or size, and don't change "minimum font size" from the default "none," as sites could detect these changes (even though these default settings aren't very readable for many users).

Maybe if looking at a device screen a few inches away, the URL being light gray isn't hard to read.
On a desktop, it's harder - for me.

Users willing to allow anything sites want, just to view them.  Many would probably put in their drivers license  if asked.  I doubt Cloudflare will lose much sleep over Tor users.

The bots couldn't be much worse at solving some sites' captchas than me.
Can't get worse than 0% success (on some sites).
I'm not so sure on some sites, they're not just jacking w/ TBB users.  Sometimes, when the solution is quite clear, it reports entries as wrong - multiple times.
When that happens a couple of tries, I just leave - assume they don't want me (Tor) there.  In TBB or Firefox, if it's not a "must see" site, I often immediately close the tab when cloudflare captcha shows.
While on other sites, I get right in w/ TBB - sometimes when captchas are difficult.  Of course, you have to allow JS & sometimes a few trackers besides the site & Cloudflare (it seems).
Most sites make money off the trackers.  If the trackers can't follow TBB users from site to site (per their business model), what incentive do the sites have for allowing TBB users?
Or why would the trackers pay sites for the traffic due to from TBB, when they can't gather the same valuable data as avg users in unhardened For sites worried about making $, it makes perfect sense to me why they wouldn't want TBB users taking resources.
At times, Cloudflare or some sites may say, "Gee, whiz - we're not blocking TBB intentionally.  We're working on a solution."
But I don't buy that  100%.  It's possibly just a politically correct excuse vs. saying, "We can't track you around the globe / make $, so we don't want you taking up bandwidth or other resources (like site tech support, etc.).
And for all the other sites that don't use Cloudflare (or other unsolvable captchas), but don't block TBB, if _"90+% of all Tor traffic attempts something malicious_," then how in the world do all those sites stay in  business / stay up & running?

Andreas, sorry - don't understand part of your comment.
"It would be quite a lot of effort to do... *what?*... this way... - sorry, it won't work any better."
Are you saying they it's a lot of effort for them to block Tor / TBB?  Or any browser - with any particular addons / plugins, settings, for that matter?  I'm no expert, but IIUC, it'd be very simple.
Just script,  If Browser=TorBrowser, then captcha response = "incorrect."  Or TBB users must enter correct captcha a minimum of X times before accepting, etc.
True.  Neither CloudFlare CEO nor I said it was.  He said, " ... "94% of requests that we see across the Tor network are _per se_ malicious," (what ever he means) w/o backing up the statement.
Again, if what CloudFlare CEO said is true, I don't see how other sites not using thier captchas & blocking Tor, keep running.
I've seen Cloudflare on low value target sites, like wood screw mfg info sites & similar.  Unless other screw mfgs are sabotaging them, I doubt much malicious activity is directed at such sites.
94% is saying essentially ALL Tor traffic / requests are "per se" malicious or use inordinate amt of resources.  That leaves me & 6% of users that aren't.
Maybe ? he's counting crawler *individual* requests - page by page - as malicious?  They might make many more requests than real users, thus the 94% claim?
His statement(s) & reasoning about blocking Tor still seem strange.  As they say, "follow the money trail."  "Money trumps all other reasons / I still say trackers aren't going to pay sites for TBB traffic. Don't say, "You're using Tor - get lost" - bad for public relations.  Instead, play dumb & covertly discourage (some) Tor users  - so they access the site w/ unhardened browsers.
Can't sites tell the difference in actions of crawlers & real users?
I'm sure some use browsers other than TBB for crawling & malicious activity.  Can't sites block / time-out crawlers from continuing to access entire site, once it becomes apparent - regardless of which browser?
I get "time outs" from making 2 very narrow term searches in < 2 min. or so, on some sites I'm registered on & participated - for a long time.
Why can't sites do the same w/ crawlers' rapid, repeated requests?

I don't see how bad guys just wouldn't adapt.  They always do.
Yes - what does that have to do w'/ Cloudflare blocking Tor?
Tor is non-profit.  They also don't use trackers.  It's different with For-profit sites.
Yes & no.  It's the business of the trackers, who pay the sites.  Some sites need / want help rejecting "unprofitable" users / traffic, that trackers won't pay them for. e.g., by using Cloudflare's unsolvable captchas to exclude Tor users.
How did Google became the giant it is?  By NOT collecting data, tracking users - not using it for advertising or selling the data? Tracking users & collecting data, building profiles is huge business.
TBB makes that much harder.  It's not hard to conclude that's why some sites don't want TBB users taking resources, though not the only reason they may have.
Exactly my point.  Maybe you got that & were reinforcing it?  If some sites didn't want to exclude TBB, they wouldn't allow Cloudflare serving unsolvable captchas.
If they're serving the same unsolvable captchas to *all* browsers, they wouldn't have any traffic.
Maybe Tor devs could meet w/ some of the sites and / or Cloudflare, to see actual data showing 94% of Tor traffic malicious.
And see if it's remotely possible to do anything about it.  Or, if it's just a made up number & not the real reason Cloudflare is blocking Tor.  Because I'm not sure the problem will go away anytime soon.
We could file a class action suit for discrimination against "freedom to choose a browser."  I think it's in the constitution.
Yes, but once a site detects crawlers repeatedly trying to access far more content than most any real user, they could put a halt.
But if an exit has 1 crawler & 99 real users, the whole exit gets blocked.  Unless the site / Cloudflare - whom ever - uses finer detection (fingerprinting, etc.) to block only certain requests from an exit - if that's possible.
I doubt they want to go to the trouble, as TBB users hurt their business anyway, from a tracking stand point.

I'm surprised there are no discussions or questions on tor-talk about this issue .
Since any exploits - whether due to "flaws" in Firefox or TBB, or not - potentially have broader implications & applications.

Point(s) accepted.  But... if it's often a better idea not to openly discuss matters involving legal or potential flaws / bugs, possibly directly affecting Tor or Firefox users, we may not follow that strategy very consistently.
"Discussing" an issue doesn't have to & shouldn't involve giving away secret / previously unannounced valuable strategies or counter measures to attacks or hacking methods.  However, seems like once any software, network  or best practices changes are made, the enemies will figure them out soon enough.
Even if nothing of value is given to the enemy, users on this list & elsewhere usually discuss hot topics w/ serious implications - sometimes We discuss general ideas on topics like how to disrupt LEAs & others from identifying users of Tor & other software; how LEAs might have identified users *and* strategies on how it could be prevented or minimized.  And much more.  Maybe some of those discussions are really bad ideas.  It just struck me as odd that this topic was one of very few when most tor-talk subscribers decided to adhere to communication silence.  I haven't checked other related lists or forums.

Umm, I guess that depends on different things.  If you have less than perfect eyesight, it's not any easier.
Besides, I'm not sure I ever finished one using TBB.  If they're the rotating, add new pics / whack-a-mole type, they never stop adding pics.  Or I never cared to keep reaching for the banana long enough.
Even if they display a random string to copy & paste, it always asked to repeat the process.  I wasn't going to solve it 10 - 20 times, unless they were giving away $500 bills.
When the distorted characters were as legible as my writing, it always says there was an error - please repeat.  Especially Google & Cloudflare.  A few others may have been more Tor friendly.
But use Firefox on the same sites - if the right scripts are allowed & not too much blocked, and it's almost always success the 1st time.
I'm not sure if their reasoning is, if it's just impossible to solve, there's  less chance of someone trying crash their site, than if they say right off, "You're using Tor - go away."

Possibly partly true, but I consider other reasons that sites (essentially) block users, sometimes lumped with Tor users.
"You can't use our site unless you allow cookies"  WTH - Really? Why is that?  Could it be that certain tracking - not just on that domain - won't work unless cookies are allowed?
"You're using  ad blocking software.  Our site won't work correctly, if at all."  [see  below]
On many sites, Tor is lumped together with ad and script blocking browsers - unprofitable and often largely untrackable.  We're no longer talking about a tiny % of users.
Are you saying that TBB is the only browser used for malicious purposes? :)  That other browsers can't be or aren't adapted by skilled users for similar malicious or unwanted behavior?
I don't really buy that.  For one thing, it's too slow.  Even using a plain browser with a proxy - which I rarely do - I'm seldom blocked.  Disregarding financial sites.  But Tor is blocked all the time on these same sites.  They don't say you're blocked, you just can't get in or use the site - even with scripts allowed.  I can use many federal govt sites just fine with TBB, but I can't do a Google search?  Talk about scraping!
I can't speak for everyone, but if ads were - still - presented as just ads, and trackers weren't trying to record everything you do across the entire internet, sell that data, provide it to the govt - on request, for a fee, then I wouldn't mind allowing small ads.  WAY back in the day, I'd click on some ads of free sites that I wanted to support.  That was way before things got to present practices. Now, there's no way I'll let them record every move.  My medical issues, political interests, legal matters...

@_subject: [tor-talk] problem reinstalling NoScript 
In TBB 6.0.5 (Win), NoScript 2.9.0.14 it seemed to be misbehaving.
It wasn't showing many trackers in the icon drop list, on sites where there would be plenty.
I UNchecked "Allow Scripts Globally."
I uninstalled it - closed TBB.  Removed  NoScript entries in pref.js & restarted TBB, then reinstalled fresh NS copy - 2 separate times.  Didn't fix it.
TBB has an "extensions-overrides.js" file in Partition (X):\Program Files\Tor Browser 4.5.3\Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Data\Browser\profile.default\preferences, that replaces some of NS default settings.  It also removes default whitelisted sites that Giorgio added (lots of google sites & others - google.com, gstatic.com, etc.).
Removing the whitelisted sites via extensions-overrides.js shouldn't cause them not to show in the NS icon drop list  Besides, it wasn't only the removed NS whitelist trackers not displaying.
In TBB, NS  hardly showed any trackers (Allow Scripts Globally still unchecked).  But did show them under the Untrusted grouping, but none were marked untrusted (that's normal).
On the same pages in Firefox there were many trackers.
I compared TBB's reinstalled NS settings to Firefox - appear almost the same.  I doubt the 2 differences I found  caused the problem?
I got NS in TBB to display all trackers - no real clue.  In TBB, under Advanced>Trusted, the "Cascade Top Document's permissions to 3rd party scripts" was checked... but *none* of the pages I loaded had *base domain* scripts allowed - I checked (so that shouldn't have caused the problem).  I unchecked the "Cascade..." option, anyway.  Maybe there's a bug w/ those 2 settings in NS?
The only other NoScript diff  in Fx & TBB was Appearance tab > "Allow" was checked in one & not the other.  I made them the same.  I can't see that causing this issue either.
Tried some new sites & both browsers show the same trackers - for now.
Anyone seen a similar NoScript problem or any clues what caused trackers not to show up, based on what I found?

@_author: Joe Btfsplk 
@_subject: [tor-talk] problem reinstalling NoScript 
I see what it is now, that was allowing all 3rd party scripts, while scripts for the base domain were blocked.  It's a NoScript setting that Tor devs put in the \Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Data\Browser\profile.default\preference\extension-overrides.js They enable the Pref "NoScript.CascadePermissions" - that corresponds to Options > Advanced > Trusted - *"Cascade top document's permissions to 3rd party scripts."*
In NoScript, it's disabled by default.
Note:  The section title for these options is "Additional permissions for TRUSTED sites."
If you have scripts blocked globally, or just one base domain has scripts *blocked*, AND the option "Cascade...permissions..." is *checked*, scripts from the base domain are blocked but it allows ALL 3rd party scripts, even though the base domain is still blocked.
I doubt this is how most users expect this to work.  I'm not sure Tor devs knew it works this way, when the base domain is blocked.
I hope they didn't know & didn't do this intentionally.
Even though the section says the settings are for "trusted" sites. I think this is a bug of sorts.  Off hand, I can't think of a reason to block base domain scripts but allow all 3rd party.  The main site probably won't work anyway.
If you *block* the base domain, then it's not trusted, in this context.
In that case, all 3rd party scripts below it should also be blocked.  Seems logical that Cascading the permissions should be dependent on base domain being allowed (trusted).  Lots of prefs are dependent on other conditions being met, or else the pref is inactive.

I guess that depends on the provider and exact type of service. AT&T "digital" (Uverse) residential internet hasn't had dynamic IPa's for several yrs.
In many places, they discontinued DSL  service, forced you into Uverse, then jacked up prices.  As did some other providers, in some areas.  Some people  near me say they also have static IPa on other providers.
I don't know if static IPa are now easier / cheaper for them to provide.  Used to be the opposite - static cost more.
Or, if static IPa's make it easier for all concerned to track users long I've tried to change IPa - to see if it's possible.  Didn't work. It may be possible (read quite a bit on it), but not easy.  AFAIK, not something that will happen in a few minutes or hours.
Some say they power down modem / router / computer for days.  When they restart, have the same IPa.
Apparently, the provider reserves that address, until maybe you discontinue service.  I'm sure the company provided (required) modem has, or gets a unique identifier when you register  for the 1st time.
I'm guessing, even if you found how to delete that, then you couldn't access their service, until you called & did the process again.

If users really want anonymity, why start with Android (Google)?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Metrics in Iran and other countries 
I don't know the complete answers, depending on which question, or if they even exist.
Assuming the metric data are being handled correctly & graphs are displaying correctly, if we look at a graph for all users from Jan. 2013 till now, the trend is still the same.  A huge increase - probably right after the Edward Snowden revelations & associated media coverage.  Then a brief, sharp drop.  After that a fairly consistent, moderate, negative Without knowing anything about the specific data generating the Tor usage graphs, they seem to follow expected patterns of human interest in big news stories.
A large, sudden increase, then a sharp decline that levels off. Once the initial shock of  an event is past, many people lose interest.  Plus, media coverage declines - onto the next story.
Going by many forms of current media coverage, some would hardly know the US is still engaged in 2 wars.  At lower levels than several years ago, but still engaged and spending tons of money.
Plus, a lot of negative publicity and anti Tor propaganda, whether accurate or not, probably turns moderately interested users away.
A lot of people are probably surprised and encouraged by the remaining increase in users from the pre-Snowden period until now.
# 2:  Depends partly on how small a number are connecting to Tor and number of users accessing a site at a given time.  And on the laws and government practices in your country.  If you're the only user connecting to Tor network via your ISP @ 8:00 PM and there's only one connection to site XYZ.com from a Tor exit relay at 8:00 PM, it's a good bet it was you.  That assumes an entity w/ the ability and desire is actually gathering the data at both ends, and that they care about the specific activity.  In that scenario, if you're doing something illegal or it's illegal to use Tor *at all* in your country & the government is actively monitoring, could be a problem.
If they're only interested in users accessing what they consider anti-government, illegal or subversive sites, but you only access Disney.com, they may not care.  That's one issue for Tor users in certain countries - you can't be positive how many Tor users are accessing a site at a specific time.  This is a _very simplified, incomplete_ explanation of some concerns about using Tor.
  The Tor Project is pretty clear that Tor Browser by itself is probably not enough to provide reasonably reliable anonymity. Especially against advanced adversaries with large resources, and if you're doing something they are keenly interested in.  If users' lives or freedom would be jeopardized by using Tor - at all or for a specific purpose, they need to study carefully other methods and practices to go along with Tor.  Much is discussed on Tor Project help / documentation / FAQ pages.  There's not a quick, easy to follow recipe to protect all Tor users in all cases, that I know of.

True.  I said they make it clear that Tor Browser probably isn't enough - especially against powerful adversaries.  I didn't say they explain in logical order, what else is required.
Possible the instructions to make it as anonymous as humanly possible is reserved for the people that mostly pay for it.
It's not that surprising since Whonix isn't part of Tor Project. They do mention it in blogs.  But, they mention NoScript, depend on its functionality - and it's not connected with Tor Project.  Lots of things they don't mention.
 From minimal knowledge, Whonix allows Tor to retain entry guard selection across sessions.
But could allow certain things to remain in the OS between sessions that theoretically could identify them.  Probably very low risk compared to other OSes, considering benefits gained.  Still, Tails & Whonix have very small staffs and tiny budgets compared to OS X, mobile OSes or most Linux distros.  If it was life or death situation, it'd be hard to trust Tails or Whonix completely.
Where Tails is amnesic across sessions, but loses the entry guard. They do discuss Tails quite a bit.
I'm not sure about any network that depends almost totally on unknown relay operators & no way to check the operators out.  As if any government couldn't plant agents as relay operators, that could pass the most rigorous, face to face interview, interrogation or background check by Tor Project.
Since it's supposed common knowledge the US Navy or military still uses the network, seems like it'd be very risky for them unless they were *positive* that their enemies - or group - aren't running a substantial number of entry and exit nodes.
One theoretical way they could be sure that aspect is not a huge risk is, if they're positive US agencies are running a substantial number of the relays.  Otherwise, aren't they're taking as big a chance as average users?  Leaving things to chance doesn't sound like modern military tactics of super powers.  I'm sure I missed something.

34. console.log( "OS: " + (os ? os : "unknown") );
35. },function() {
36. console.log( "OS: n/a (not a Firefox)" );
37. });
38. The prefs & values the code is querying appears in about:config, as would many firefox.js settings.
Question for devs / Firefox experts:  many prefs are reported to sites so they can display content, but are they allowed to access every setting in about:config - default or user set?
This can't be correct.  That would make users very unique.
Is this bug somehow supposed to allow only querying firefox.js values & no other files?  Why is that?  If allowed access to firefox.js, why not all firefox files?

They offer end to end encryption - between Unseen users, using their own app loaded on computers.  They'll keep encrypted messages on their server, if you want.  It's proprietary encryption, which some don't like (can't be independently tested).  They claim they intentionally never have the private key, so no LEAs can force them to decrypt or hand over I'm not sure that independent testing of encrypton or software is as relevant today, if - - avoiding state players is a main concern. For protection against _non-government criminals_ (see what I did there?), independent testing is important.  Even the largest universities' or security firms' resources are tiny compared to the time, money, talent and computing power that nations put towards cracking encryption, paying for or coercing back doors, or finding exploitable software bugs.

"No sane reason why they would block Tor," except they want to make money.  The less personal data or real IPa's they get, the less money.
Also, I've seen various sites *seem* to block exit relays from certain I say "seem to" because if I switched exits to different countries, sometimes it works.  Not always.  More often, it's a matter of allowing the right trackers / scripts.
Google almost always wants or needs a lot of scripts enabled for content to work.  Admittedly, sometimes the content or service Google provides is useful.  But more ways to gather extra data is icing on the cake for them.  After all, they're primarily in business to gather data, deliver ads & who knows what else.

I can't say about Gmail today (I hope you're not trying to use it w/ Tor, hoping for anonymity).
But w/ other login sites that balked at Tor, forcing a exit relay in same country that you signed up from, sometimes fixed the messages like, "We've detected unusual behavior...  Give us your home phone & address & we'll call you." :D   Sometimes even Startpage, DDG, etc. will pop a captcha.  I wonder why, until I look at the exit country & it's China or Uzbekistan or such.  After I change that to a country less known for cybercrime, no more capthcas on those sites.
Probably depends on the proxy.  You could try, but I'm guessing that's what a lot of spammers & scammers try.  Gmail has pretty strict rules to try & prevent fraud (keep a good reputation). They don't want to lose many users, or they don't get to scan the email & scrape the private data.  Would be financial loss, so they don't want other ISPs or sites blocking gmail.
It's hard to sign up for gmail w/ Tor.  They want SMS authentication, which is usually going to blow most users' anonymity.
By contrast, if you create an acct w/ non-Tor browser, then access it w/ TBB, that accomplishes nothing - as for anonymity.
Only creating an acct w/ TBB & then *never* accessing it w/ anything else (& not having addons or plugins that might leak IPa) will accomplish anonymity.  For Tor Browser email, it just seems a better idea to start w/ a provider that's both Tor friendly AND privacy / security conscious.  That's not google.
Even then, I'm not sure.  What if you get an email - via TBB, that mentions your real name, or is from someone in your town - using their real IPa - saying, "come on over tonight, to 123 Oak St.," or gives their phone  etc.?  Then the mail provider effectively knows which town you live in, at minimum.  The right agencies can then cross reference that person's contacts - if they want.  And then probably the national security agency know all that.

Thanks Moritz.  Yes, the reply was helpful.  Comments / follow-up inserted below.
Your comments mostly follow what I assumed.  But, seems to leave even advanced users abandoned on timely Tor / Tor Browser & related software tech support.  I get that "tor-project" is intended to discuss  project related issues.
The ideal scenario may be for quality contributors to return to tor-talk.  They may not come back to the same unmoderated list.
It's not happening, now.  As you said, no one can be forced.  If tor-talk remains unmoderated, the ranting will likely continue. *"If nothing changes, nothing changes."*  Same is true for most unmoderated forums or lists I've briefly viewed - they're usually a free-for-all.  Something about hiding behind computers...
This leaves 2 questions.  1) Where is the real technical support for Tor 2) If tor-talk is unmoderated / unstaffed, doesn't that leave users in a Tor-talk exists, but isn't providing consistent support. Apparently, being unmoderated drives away technical users, but allows long rants.
For a *technical support list,* why not moderate tor-talk?  To keep peace, but also provide qualified support?  There's nothing preventing making changes.
If a few just want to insult, they could start their own "Tor Sucks" list.
I know of very few developer run forums allowing endless rants or pointless, crude comments.
_Polite, sincere_ suggestions for features or policies changes are often necessary.  Many forums allow that.  I've made polite, critical suggestions on many forums, that lead to change - though sometimes initially got criticism.  A few got snarky, initial comments from the devs, until the reasoning was clarified or they thought it over.  Then some showed up on change lists.   Very different from ranting.
AFAIK, there are very few major softwares w/o _moderated_, active forums or lists.  Usually with mods' or official reps' technical input, as needed.
Otherwise, users are on their own.  With Tor, lives or freedom could be at stake.   It's unimaginable that Mozilla wouldn't have actively moderated, staffed support forums for each product.
Now, Tor users might get better support on Mozillazine, if mods allowed the question.  There may be more advanced Tor users on Mozilla / Mozillazine forums than on tor-talk.
It seems that's what's happened to Tor users.  For most software or hardware, if users can't get timely support, the user base may decline.
Even one man, open source projects often have active, moderated tech support forums.

Thanks Moritz.  Most of that sounds good, but seems to leave the quality tech support issue in limbo (not your personal responsibility).
I'm not being rude & hope I'm not beating a dead horse - just asking, what's the hold up on such an obvious need, that (apparently) requires relatively little, or else one man operations would never be able to do it.
Upshot:  I don't know why major software project, communicating on a world wide network wouldn't have a company run support forum.
Manned by company employees or their appointees.
I may be stating what many users are thinking.  I think many potential Tor users fear or distrust what they don't fully understand.  Which would seem to slow the increase of users.  Tor Project says it needs to increase users, right?
If that forum is to be stackexchange, shouldn't there should be project  reps / mods - sometimes, qualified to answer many questions, or have tools to find answers?
Many small projects provide excellent support (I use them all the time), on a fraction of Tor Project's resources.  They often give precise, detailed answers in < 24 hrs.
They usually don't answer, "Not sure.  Good luck."  Some years back, I contacted the Tor help desk, which told me to post on stack exchange.  It got no helpful answers, when I was sure one existed. That was long ago, but typical users generally don't like that. Many walk away if they can't get help quickly.  Or lose their freedom if using Tor incorrectly in some countries.
Maybe Tor Project sees the value of a well run support forum, but never act.  Tor-talk or any mailing list may never provide the best support for Tor users.  Mailing lists aren't worthless, but lot's of users find long, technical discussions hard to follow on them - even w/ "conversation or thread view."
Partly, because users reply in different "formats."  Sometimes not quoting enough, for full context (then you have to find / read prior emails?);  sometimes forwarding far too many replies - repeatedly. Sometimes a true pain to find earlier details.  Sometimes they top / bottom post, or insert inline.  Some mail clients don't display other clients' formatting correctly.
Forum software puts everything in order & makes it easy(ier) to find & refer to full, previous comments - even link them.  You just scroll down the entire conversation.  Better search, easier to quote, insert images, code, etc.  Maybe a Tor operated forum would allow including a few, small, unintrusive ads - or not (not from Google, etc.).  For donations, sale of T-shirts - "I hacked the NSA & all I got was this lousy T-shirt," Alien hats, caps that look like aluminum foil??  Maybe most users wouldn't mind, so long as ads didn't come from trackers.
Kind of touchy subject - maybe conduct a survey.  Some might not mind small pay for click ads, when using TBB, if it generated enough revenue to matter - it may not.  I believe? some Tor leaders have said the current funding model needs to change?  There are only so many ways to do that.  It has to start somewhere, or nothing ever changes.  I'm not the 1st to say, a large % of potential users will never trust anonymity software largely funded by any government agency.  That's no secret to Tor Project.   Just a thought.

What is the reason(s) the TBB instructions say do not install (extract) TBB to root?
Is it so the TBB files will be in a location where the user has write permissions, so that TBB updates can automatically  D/L and install?
Other than that, does installing TBB to a location where anyone / anything has full r/w/x permissions (like in /home), weaken the security of Linux, compared to packages installed via a distro's software manager?

@_author: Joe Btfsplk 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Linux_don't extract to root 
Thanks.  I may be missing something here.  Anyone feel free to correct me where I'm wrong.
I'm not "doing" anything with /home permissions - it's Linux defaults.  AFAIK, once a user logs into their 'nix acct, anything that writes to (most) files in /home can do so - w/o any prompting.
For browsers - Firefox - that's full access to most things under .mozilla, but not Firefox program files - installed elsewhere.  In files there - no PW required to change files there (once logged in).  There're some exceptions to that, like .local/keyrings.
For TBB extracted to a folder in /home, on files I checked (tor, cached-certs, torrc, etc.) - the user is owner & has r/w/(x) permissions by default.  No PW required - like any document in /home.  So anything that makes it past basic defenses of the browser, NoScript, etc. - would generally have r/w/x permissions on most TBB files in /home - yes?
Conversely, Firefox installed to /usr & other protected directories that most installed apps use, by default the user or anything making it onto the computer don't have w/x permissions for those "program files."  Yes?  That's part of Linux overall security.
Maybe I'm missing something.  Tor Project goes to great lengths to provide uncompromised TBB copies & ways to verify them, but at least in Linux - advises putting it in the least secure area, so  it can update automatically with one click?  (because TBB wasn't installed via a Linux software manager & therefore automatic updates wouldn't be allowed).  Seems like that's in opposition to all the other TBB security efforts.
When Linux users choose to D/L the latest release from mozilla & install to /opt or /usr/local, it won't update automatically or w/ a  click, AFAIK.  Unless you change ownership / permissions of those directories - which I've read is a bad idea, security wise.  (I'm not sure the D/L Linux Fx ver has "update now" available in about:firefox, anyway).
But, for Fx or Tbird in /opt you can install update files from Mozilla easily enough using sudo.  It takes typing a few characters vs. one click.

@_author: Joe Btfsplk 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Linux_don't extract to root 
Jonathan - thanks.  Other than automatically updating, what are the advantages of installing to /home/user - or somewhere not root owned?
The other main disadvantage is, it makes TBB program files easily accessible to malware, or anyone / thing w/ access to your machine, after the user logs on.
Yes - technically /home/user.  There is a separate "/home" under System Files, but if there's only one user acct, then it contains the same folders as clicking /home/user.  AFAIK, for single user acct setup, the only things under "/home" are user files & settings.  Most  accessible by the acct user w/o a PW.
No, I don't mean "ordinary, non-malicious stuff" D/L through TBB. TBB isn't 100% bullet proof - nor any other app.  I mean malicious things that could slip by, even via zero days.  Zero days - maybe unlikely.  Other methods - apparently not terribly difficult.
That's why I said, "So anything that makes it past basic defenses of the browser, NoScript, etc. - would
generally have r/w/x permissions on most TBB files in /home(/user)."
I assumed that was clear it implied malware, or a malicious sites, or adversary - say, trying to modify TBB program files, etc.  Not ordinary websites, following the rules.
Again, IIUC, "malware" making it past browser & NoScript defenses and AV - if using one,  has far easier access to TBB program files than apps installed to  limited permissions directories.  TBB files are less protected than a normal browser installed from repositories, or even installed manually to say, /opt.
That's the part I don't understand - why TorProject seems to encourage lessening some of Linux security, rather than increasing it.
Perhaps if Tor Project doesn't want to set up a PPA (and guard, monitor it) - so TBB can auto-update, they should include a sort of "Tor / TBB file checker" - to monitor for changed files that shouldn't change, unless from updates.
Seems logical to create a PPA.  They could / should check signatures - automatically - when the updates / installs finish downloading from the PPA, before installing.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Linux_don't extract to root 
You're correct - installing it to a "non-writable" location isn't necessarily the end of days.  The rest of your argument against improving security & anonymity contradicts some long standing practices of Tor Project and some basic concepts of Linux.  If there was / is no value of Linux installing most programs & libraries to root, they wouldn't do it.
100's of changes & methods that Tor Project makes w/ TBB, individually have small impact on overall anonymity or security. Collectively they make a huge difference.  If installing TBB  to root directories adds - some - protection, it seems as valid as 100's of changes & fixes made over the yrs.
   Many  trac feature changes & bug fixes to change minor TBB behaviors have no more impact than installing TBB to more protected Linux directories.  Some had zero impact on anonymity or security.
Tor Project could implement a script allowing auto-updating (or w/ a click or 2), or they could use a PPA to install & update it.
For yrs, there was such an Ubuntu PPA / repo & small script, to allow installing & auto-updating of Mozilla Fx releases, when installed to

What exactly do you mean, "I repeatedly clicked on "Blocked Objects" right after a page was loaded?"

I'm not an expert on meanings of all TBB debug logs.  Someone else may fully understand the following error:

Right now, TBB won't let me into my security settings.  IIRC, for highest level, it says something like some pages may break or have problems.  IIRC, JS is blocked in highest level.  That alone will prevent many pages from loading - at all.
As for TBB closing - it may be a bug (or not) when you repeatedly click on the blocked object place holder.
In general, repeatedly clicking error popups & many other items can cause problems in any browser.  Clicking them 10x won't help.
Does it show you *which* objects were blocked?  Generally, when the blocked scripts or objects UI is displayed, you read it for info purposes & close it by clicking anywhere else on the page.
Most pages - or the browser - don't crash just because fonts aren't allowed to D/L.  Anything's possible.
Does this crashing happen when loading specific site(s), or just at TBB startup & home page (if showing TBB home page)?  If it's only a couple of sites, likely a problem w/ them.
Do you have a 3840x2160 screen? I have no idea if TBB handles this - may be fine?
"Blocked objects," not "blocked scripts?"  There's a difference.
OK, so NoScript showed you what you requested (by clicking) - I guess?  Did it actually show a list of blocked objects or scripts, or did it hang producing that UI?    If NS didn't show it, something's blocking - I assume.  If so, sounds like a question for NoScript support (forum).
Refer to last question.  But, why are you clicking NS menu popup item *so* many times?  I see no point, but maybe you've left something out.
Does blocked objects / scripts UI ever display correctly? (Y / N).
What happens if you wait (say 30 - 60 sec) for blocked objects UI to display?
If "blocked objects UI" isn't displaying or hangs or won't close, I'd post on NoScript forum.
Do you have checked in NS options, Notifications > blocked SCRIPTS to hide notices after x seconds?

Do you have a discrete GPU card, and are you using the mfg's proprietary drivers?  Some (like Nvidia - maybe others) have GPU problems, causing crashes, freezes, black screens - if use Linux open source video drivers.
But, it could be a bug - some graphic function in which ever desktop you're using (you mentioned shadows); possibly NoScript and / or TBB can't handle it.  Have you tried temporarily disabling NS to make sure nothing else can cause the same issue.  Though might take a while to rule out "everything" else.  Folks in NS forum / support may already know about it.  They're usually pretty good at looking into things.  You'll have to give full details of your OS flavor, version, etc.

I just edited the desktop launcher &  re-selected the same icon (was already using - the one you mentioned).  For now it's displaying OK in the panel.
Looks like that icon file was changed in the update to 6.5.2.  Maybe the previous file got damaged, so Linux pulled the standard Fx icon from another place.   I'm not sure the orange Fx icon is included in the Linux TBB package.

Key words are "initial default UI size."
Like many, I've had problems with TBB spoofing the correct screen sizes to sites like browserspy.dk & panopticlick.eff.org.
The  - about TBB screen sizing (rounding, spoofing) says it's closed.
Mike P. commented in  "This bug has drifted. I think we should open new bugs for remaining issues with the rounding code that aren't quite a mismash of ancient issues and dead code. Current related bugs that will remain open are  ,  ."  I don't know where to add my findings.
I read through the other 2 (a lot there).  Most details either don't seem to apply in my case, or described behavior isn't what I'm experiencing (exactly).
Today, D/L clean 6.0.8 (Win).  Installed clean in new folder.
Left all default settings - didn't even change NoScript settings, for screen size testing.
1st time started TBB, the *vertical* ht (total) exceeded my 22" WS monitor - went below Vista's taskbar, by about 27 - 30 px.
My taskbar is "stock" - never resized it - it's ~ 3/8" high.  The very top TBB's border was perfectly aligned w/ top of my monitor.
Browserspy reported screen size as 1000 px W x about 9xx px H (not an even number).
To see how far TBB went below the task bar, I unchecked "keep taskbar on top of applications."
Surprise, when I re-enabled that option, the TBB screen height suddenly "resized" its height to fit perfectly between top of monitor & top edge of task bar.  I restarted TBB - again it went below the task bar.  Disabled / re-enabled the taskbar to stay on top & again TBB's height adjusted to fit between the taskbar & top of monitor.
Then... I restarted TBB again.  This time TBB's bottom border was ~ 7/16" *above* the taskbar, with top border still aligned to top of monitor.  Then Browserspy reported 1000 px W by 729 "available height" (what ever that means).
1) Does anyone using Windows ever see TBB width AND height reported as even numbers - or multiples of 100?  If so, what site or tool is reporting that?
2) For those seeing even H & W multiples, is your TBB usable screen area *actually* square, or is that just what TBB reports to sites?
My TBB *actual* usable screen is 3" wider than tall.  That's between inside of L & R borders; btwn bottom of Nav bar & top of taskbar.
3) Except for amazing coincidence, I'm guessing TBB's total height would never perfectly fill the space between monitor's top & taskbar's top edge (and expect a multiple of 100).
4) What's TBB's spoofed screen W : H ratio *supposed to be* (now)? X by X, in multiples of 100?  So, square?  I can't keep up w/ all the changes.

Then has a line: "Locale String 1/9/2017, x:xx:xx AM (PM)," which was my computer clock's exact time.
Below that there's a string:  "Milliseconds since January 1, 1970" with a 13 digit number - milliseconds since Epoch (Unix).
Finally, it shows "Time on your PC," that was my computer clock's exact date and time.
Browserspy also showed the difference between their server time and my PC, down to a few seconds.
I couldn't find a similar string in TBB files' contents in all its folders (even the string's 1st 6 numbers) w/ a fast search tool, immediately after getting a new time from the site.  But it may not accurately find file content in so many folder levels.

Thanks Georg.  That sounds like it.  Was "ToLocaleString" a recent change in Firefox function (or browser standards) that wasn't caught by Tor devs or users before Mozilla implemented it, or some other scenario?
Possibly another example of how dissidents, sympathizers, whistle blowers connecting TBB directly through an ISP (certain countries) could be more easily identified.  Very difficult to consistently, quickly keep all leaks patched.
When issues like this are 1st discovered, should there be a better notification system for users, explaining risks and suggested workarounds?  Few users have time to read every new Trac report.
Even if they did, many users wouldn't how to avoid risks. Is there any "early warning system" giving *precise* steps to avoid new anonymity threats?  Similar to warnings OS & software developers often issue?
AFAICT, Tor bugs are reported, but often no steps recommended to avoid the danger, until patches can be developed.  (Temporarily stop using TBB for serious activities?)   Does this at times leave some users totally unaware they could be exposed in certain situations?

You're correct.  Browserspy.dk has a lot more Tor exits blacklisted than it used to.  A yr ago, I rarely saw a blacklisted address notice.  Not sure why - maybe hackers are trying to grab data about the site's visitors?
Usually, it only takes me getting 1 - 2 new circuits to connect; rarely 4 - 5 attempts - goes pretty fast for me.
Browserspy.dk detects many more browser characteristics / fingerprinting data than several similar sites.

In TBB 6.08, there's a torbutton pref in about:config - "extensions.torbutton.resize_windows" = false, by default.
I understand it's enabled in TBB 6.5a (maybe not).
The resizing of my screen height in 6.08 is sketchy.  But if I enable the pref above, seems to make height resizing consistent to an even multiple of 100.
I wonder if there are undocumented issues with turning it on in v6.08?  If there's good reason to leave it off in this version, even though it seems to improve resizing for me?
Question 2:  There's tons of discussion on sites detecting *installed fonts* in browsers & TBB's efforts to prevent it, or just present a fixed, short list of fonts.
Has anyone seen reputable data about sites detecting the named *serif font,* its size or the "minimum font size" in TBB?
Whether sites (that care) can detect if you changed the default Times New Roman font - size 16?  I've found almost nothing on that.
Secondly, the default setting in Content> Advanced, for "minimum font size - None" can wreak havoc on me if "Allow pages to choose their own fonts..." is also left checked (default).
I wonder if they can detect that you've changed minimum font size to something reasonable, like 13 - 14?
When pages use very small fonts & there's no lower limit in TBB,  it can be unreadable.   At some point, I may have to concede letting them detect I've made a font size change, or just not read some pages.  But, it's been 2 yrs for many that screen height resizing didn't work correctly & apparently that wasn't a giant concern.

This was a large, national organization that understands people actually needing privacy.  It's one of their main promises to everyone dealing with their organization.
I understand sites having to protect themselves, but there's a lot of mainstream public education to be done about legitimate uses for Tor.
The majority of Tor news coverage from sources that are more likely to reach the general public seems to be negative.
As long as that's true, Tor will continue to be harder to use - attracting fewer new users.  The average citizen or even average CEO doesn't read The Guardian or similar sites that might run positive stories about Tor.

With default settings, TBB 6.5 (Win) doesn't round screen sizes at all.
Browserspy.dk shows 993 x 695.  I see the pref "extensions.torbutton.resize_windows" is still set false by default.
Toggling it to true gives different reported screen size, but not increments of 100 or 200.
The pref "extensions.torbutton.resize_new_windows" = true (default), but I don't find toggling both these prefs in any combo correctly rounds screen size.
In TBB 6.08, when I tested setting "extensions.torbutton.resize_windows" = true, it consistently rounded screens to 1000 x 800 on this monitor.
With that pref at default False in v6.08, reported screen height was odd size - like 72x (x not 0).  But the width was *still 1000.*
In v6.5, neither width or height is rounded correctly, regardless of the pref value.  What happened?  I thought 6.5 was supposed to fix screen size rounding?

OK, thanks - I will.  Others can see if they also notice the following.
When TBB 6.5 (Win) opens, it doesn't align its top border w/ top of monitor / display (if it's supposed to).
It aligned to top of monitor in v6.08, allowed more room for resized screen height.

@_subject: [tor-talk] should minimizing Tor Browser reset screen size? 
In Linux, it's very easy to grab TBB's drag screen bar when reaching for scroll bar.  I've done it several times now.
If you only move it a few px, it's hard to tell if it changed, unless go to a browser check site.
Appears that minimizing TBB to the panel / task bar & restoring it doesn't reset it to the correct spoofed H x W.
Only a new identity or restarting TBB (both restart) reset the screen size.
Shouldn't minimizing it completely, then restoring cause a reset to the default spoofed size?  Maybe an option under Tor button to reset it?

Will TBB for Linux be able to D/L & install updates OK, it's installed (extracted) to a different directory -like /opt?
So far in Mint 18.1, for Firefox - downloaded version - installed to same - right or wrong.
When Fx tar package is D/L & installed, it doesn't even show a "check for updates" in the about:firefox UI - by default.
So I'm not sure if TBB - Linux will automatically install updates (as in Windows), or if you have to D/L the new package each release & extract it?

Apparently, most of the advanced Tor users / devs or highly advanced computer users left.  Your post is about a highly technical aspect that probably needs input of users with a deeper understanding of Tor network & the software.

This involves *at least* Linux (Mint 18.1) Tor Browser 7.04 and 7.05, over at least a couple months.
This seems like a huge privacy / anonymity issue.
Why is there a *"recently-used.xbel"*, file in my Tor Browser installation directory - in path shown and  labeled as file TYPE: "XBEL bookmarks" recording ACTUAL local file names, dates, times - they were accessed AND some DOWNLOADED files (like *.pdf) with dates and times?
~/.torbrowser/torbrowser-7.0/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/.local/share/recently-used.xbel. *TBB is installed in home directory: ~/.torbrowser.*
For instance, Listed is a downloaded *pdf file, about health issues* and many others.
All dates shown in THIS instance of recently-used.xbel seem to be in July and Aug, 2017, but I used the same TBB installation before and after the dates shown in recently-used.xbel .
In Linux, there's also a ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel file - by default, but it is set asimmutable, so nothing written to it.
The TBB recently-used.xbel file even shows date and time I downloaded TBB 7.0.4, and a random 6 digit string added after the "visited" time, with 'Z" at the end, such as (I removed actual times & 6 digit string:
Each file record shown in "recently-used.xbel" show this:

~/.torbrowser/torbrowser-7.0/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/.nv/GLCache/********************************/*******************************1af.bin (very long, random strings, I removed)
  ~/.torbrowser/torbrowser-7.0/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/.nv/GLCache//********************************/*******************************1af.toc
These .bin and .toc files seem ? related to my Nvidia GPU or drivers?  Not sure what's in them.  The same type files are written to the ~/.nv folder, but I don't see why they're written to a Tor Browser folder.
I don't know the meaning of  "bookmark" in this context -  in the TBB recently-used.xbel file.
Tor Browser is supposed to delete / not store any data to disk after it's closed (or not write to disk at all).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Security Settings warning 
Probably around the time of recent changes in Tor Browser / TorButton, I started seeing a warning when I click on Security Settings in Tor Button.
Pop up title: Tor Browser Security Settings
Security Level
"Your custom browser preferences have resulted in unusual security settings.  For security and privacy reasons, we recommend you choose one of the default security levels."
After that, only a "Restore Defaults" button shows in the message - no options to choose from.  That's part of the problem.  If I try to check TBB's security level setting (low, medium, high) it always shows the message above.
I can click Restore Defaults, but next session - w/o me changing anything in between, it shows the same message if I try to check "Security Settings."
As far as I've ever been able to tell, clicking Restore Defaults doesn't change anything under the browser Preferences > Privacy tab or anything in NoScript.
In TBB - Preferences > Privacy, the only non-default setting I know is "Remember my browsing & download history" is checked.
But all data is set to be deleted when browser closes.  TBB does that All other settings in Preferences/Privacy are default.
After several times (sessions), over the last few TBB versions, of clicking "Restore Defaults" (security settings) the next session it shows the same popup if I check security settings again.
Other than that, I don't know what "unusual settings" it means, or if Tor Button security is slightly broken?
The security slider is usually set on low; sometimes medium.  That doesn't affect seeing the popup.

@_subject: [tor-talk] noscript 10.2 default mandatory sites, trusted sites 
Many of these settings aren't brand new (some are fairly new), but I'm not sure how some of these settings are actually used in NoScript.
If they are used "as is," or if settings in one file (say, defaults.js) interacts w/ or is overridden by other NS files.  Has anyone seen official explanations how these sites shown as default or trusted actually work in TBB?
All of these are from TBB 8.4, noscript 10.2.
To see the files / settings, you have to copy or extract the noscript .xpi file to a different location (has an alpha-numeric name: {73a6fe31-595d-460b-a920-fcc0f8843232}.xpi, from These are from the NS /legacy/defaults.js file:

Note sites like google.com, googlevideo.com, hotmail.com, maps.googleapis.com, paypal, yahoo & yahooapis.com and many others.
Are the legacy/default.js sites applied "as is" in TBB?  Where is that If they're allowed as shown, for example, I wouldn't want anything for yahoo & their horrible security record, always enabled by default.
The following are from the noscript /common/Policy.js file. I only scratched the surface:
  function defaultOptions() {
     return {
       sites:{
         trusted: `addons.mozilla.org
           afx.ms ajax.aspnetcdn.com
           ajax.googleapis.com bootstrapcdn.com
           code.jquery.com firstdata.com firstdata.lv gfx.ms
           google.com googlevideo.com gstatic.com
           hotmail.com live.com live.net
           maps.googleapis.com mozilla.net
           netflix.com nflxext.com nflximg.com nflxvideo.net
           noscript.net
           outlook.com passport.com passport.net passportimages.com
           paypal.com paypalobjects.com
           securecode.com securesuite.net sfx.ms tinymce.cachefly.net
           wlxrs.com
           yahoo.com yahooapis.com
           yimg.com youtube.com          untrusted: [],
         custom: {},
       },
       DEFAULT: new Permissions(["frame", "fetch", "other"]),
       TRUSTED: new Permissions(Permissions.ALL),
       UNTRUSTED: new Permissions(),
       enforced: true,
       autoAllowTop: false,
     };
   }
Again, are these used "as is," or is there a reason they're shown here as (always) trusted?
Many users wouldn't want some of them Trusted by default - maybe never.
Note also - Policy.js shows the Default tab permissions are only supposed to be: "frame, fetch & other."
Everytime I start TBB, *ALL permissions* are enabled again under Default tab, not just the 3 shown.  NoScript 10 in Firefox saves custom settings & only has the 3 permissions enabled under Default tab.
This was reported right after NS 10 landed in TBB & still not fixed.  Like users aren't supposed to touch them. NoScript saving settings between sessions - if users choose - should be fairly simple.  Most apps outside of TBB allow it.
In TBB 8.0 - 8.4, backing up NS settings after changes still doesn't work, but works OK in Firefox.
It's one thing if all permissions are enabled by default so non-tech users can browse most sites with no interaction.  It's quite another if NS won't save changed settings or export them.

Thanks Georg.  Thanks for pointing out the noscript-control.js file.  The path in TBB would be easier.  I'm not sure about no worries.
So with NoScript quantum (10.x) in TBB, users that don't want basically everything allowed, will have to put Torbutton slider on Safest, then pick & choose which 1st or 3rd parties they'll allow, and whether it will be temporary or permanent (Trusted).
The NoScript UI is deceiving.  If only the torbutton slider is moved to Standard or Safest, after pages load, the NS UI looks exactly the same,  That is, it shows nothing, either mode.
If TBB / NS is allowing all domains and trackers to load in Torbutton Standard (or however many and which), it should show which 1st or 3rd parties have been allowed in the NS menu.
Now, there's no indication that every domain has been allowed.  If they've been allowed (manually *or automatically*), they should show a check mark.
If they've been blocked, it should show that as well.  As is, the NoScript UI isn't that useful.

According to several sources, it's quite possible the check.torproject.org site is down or malfunctioning.
Other sites,  returned a "No" on the first exit relay entered, but verified "yes, you're using Tor" for a new Tor circuit.
The "go to the download page" is an odd, unhelpful message, especially if there's nothing wrong w/ the TBB install.
New or less technical users may not have a clue what to do based on that *Instead* of an ambiguous answer if check.torproject has temporary problems, why not show a message with *specific alternative sites* to verify TBB & Tor connection, *before* doing the process of download / verify / reinstall TBB?  Surely that would often be faster and reduce usage of the download server?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor check not working or recognize TBB? 
Thanks Tortilla.
I don't see how your reply answers the question - maybe it wasn't intended to.
It appears if the general.useragent.override string isn't the same as what ever / where ever check.torproject.org stores as a valid useragent.override value, it reports that you're not using TBB at all, which is not true.
Torproject of course wants everyone to report the same general.useragent.override sting - that's fine.
To report that it doesn't look like TorBrowser (at all) is misleading to users and not helpful.
Since they must be able to see the useragent string, they probably should report something about the useragent being wrong or not set to default settings.
Downloading & extracting the same version to the same path isn't going to fix the problem of the useragent string being accidentally changed.  AFAIK, it won't over write your prefs, unless you extract it to a different path.
There's nothing helpful in the message, "It does not appear to be Tor If it's smart enough to throw an error for a non-default useragent string, it should be able to tell you why it thinks you're not using ANY TBB version and give a clue about what to do, instead of the current message that doesn't help at all.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Security Settings warning 
Georg (or anyone),
     I D/L TBB 7.5.6 Linux & verified w/ GPG.
Installed to new directory as you suggested.
After the clean install, Torbutton Security didn't show a msg about "unusual security settings."
As most know, TBB ships w/ NoScript set to allow all scripts globally (which NoScript warns as "Dangerous").
I changed NS to deny scripts globally, as many experienced users do (in TBB and other browsers).
Like many, I don't allow NS to "cascade top document's permissions to 3rd party scripts," under Advanced > Trusted.  [for newer users, "top document's permissions" (the target web page's permissions) means what ever scripts or permissions you allowed for your target site, any & all 3rd parties the have the same permissions].  Which could be very dangerous if a site is hacked with malicious scripts & NoScript says, "Come on in!"
Under NoScript Advanced > HTTPS, I UNcheck, "Allow HTTPS scripts globally on HTTPS documents," because there's generally no reason to allow *ALL* 3rd party trackers' or hackers' HTTPS scripts, but plenty of reasons not to.
Now Torbutton > Security Settings shows the "unusual security settings" message, "for security and privacy reasons," as if these settings are more dangerous than the defaults.
When I click Torbutton's Restore Default Settings, the only thing I find it resets is NoScript to allow scripts globally, under the whitelist tab.  AFAIK, it doesn't change any (other) NoScript settings, or about:config prefs & nothing under TBB Preferences > Privacy.
It appears that Torbutton thinks allowing scripts globally is a safer way to go.

In general, Tor Browser doesn't write any history to disk - by design.  If you look in about:config at settings whether to use disk cache, it should be set to false.
If you have enough RAM, you can do the same in regular Firefox. Allow enough memory to handle browsing. browser.cache.memory.max_entry_size;512000  or 1000000.
RAM's a whole lot faster than a disk - even SSDs.
There have been many problems through the yrs on not deleting cache, cookies, history - you name it - the way it was supposed to.
I set the clear history UI to clear everything but site preferences (cookie exceptions).
Mozilla has changed the Privacy & Security area even more in v63, so I wouldn't be surprised if there are more bugs.
I used to use addons to clear cache, history, because Fx didn't do it completely.  Maybe 3 letter agencies are demanding (or paying) that history not be cleared as advertised. There have always been privacy (& security) issues w/ all browsers that dragged on forever.  As far as we know, it's still no where near as bad as IE of old, where they hid at least one history file, as a system, hidden file(s).  But you couldn't search & find it - no matter what.  You had to KNOW the exact, long path to the file & enter that before you could delete it.

The scrollbars & slider / thumb are so narrow in recent TBB  or Firefox versions, on desktop versions there's a fraction of an inch between grabbing the slider or grabbing the window border & moving it, unless you're very careful.

@_subject: [tor-talk] torbrowser login problems, no cookies set, 
If anyone can give insight, or several users each give a useful tip, I'd appreciate it.  I'm burned out on NS v10 issues.
In Linux, TBB 8 with noscript 10.1.9.6 is giving problems, loading content and/ or logging into sites.
There are several sites that haven't worked right since NS 10.x (latest .1.9.6) & TBB v8.  No matter what settings, or if ALL NS settings are I installed SAME version NS in *Firefox 60.1 esr*.  Checked that the "Trusted" mode in NS had same settings checked in TBB & Fx.
In TBB, I can log into trac, but loading another page (e.g. view tickets), trac apparently sees no cookie & tells me I'm not logged in.
Trac displays messages, "Missing or invalid form token. Do you have cookies enabled?"
"SEARCH_VIEW privileges are required to perform this operation. You don't have the required permissions."
In TBB Prefs / Privacy settings, cookies are blocked, BUT exceptions are set to allow session cookies on both  & ...trac.torproject..., and many other sites.
Disabling NS in TBB, restarting & reloading trac site - same problems.
So TBB SHOULD be allowing session cookies - it's not. This has always worked , but we didn't have NS quantum.
Again, it's not JUST torproject site w/ a problem loading content or logging in under TBB 8 & NS 10.xxx.
In Firefox 60.1 esr w/ NS 10.x, I have same NS settings as in TBB. The same "cookies blocked" in preferences.
For sites w/ session cookie exceptions, I can NOT SEE cookies listed in Fx Prefs / Manage Data - just a blank screen.
But in Fx 60, R click on any site's - "page info" - that has session cookie exceptions stored in Fx, then I see the cookies names & content.
issue 1: Those cookies aren't visible in Fx 60 w/ NS 10.x, under Privacy - "manage data", (formerly "show cookies").  But are visible viewing the page info> Security tab.
issue 2: Even on some sites not requiring cookies to "work," TBB v8 & NS v10 are having problems displaying some sites correctly, or at all.
Where the same sites will usually work in Fx 60 w/ NS v10 (same settings as in TBB), whether cookies are needed or not for the site to work.
issue 3: In Fx 60 w/ NS 10, when restart in safe mode w/ (the only) addon disabled, suddenly any set cookies NOW ARE visible in Prefs>Privacy>Cookies> Manage Data.
At least in Fx 60, it appears NS 10 is what's preventing set cookies from being visible under Privacy > Manage Data (but WERE visible under a site's Page Info>Privacy tab - even w/ NS installed). Therefore, likely the same NS issue in TBB.
issue 4: In TBB, I uninstalled (not just disabled) NS and restarted.  No change.  Disabled HTTPS everywhere & restated - logged into trac.
Same message "Missing or invalid form token. Do you have cookies enabled?" But there are NO errors or warnings (now) in web console.
So removing NS 10 in Firefox 60esr FIXED problems of not being able to see cookies in Fx Privacy UI.
** I ALSO compared all cookie prefs in about:config for Fx 60 vs. TBB 8. They were all identical.  I don't think any cookie prefs were present in one browser but not the other.
I've read the several NS 10 tutorials that NoScript's site or AMO page link. I think I understand it - especially if using same settings in both browsers.
I don't think there's ANY NS v10 setting that should *prevent seeing cookies* in both TBB & Firefox.
The most important is, sites that don't work at all in TBB (with or w/o cookies), often do work in Fx 60 w/ SAME settings as TBB 8 and NS.
Personally, NS 10 may be "Not Ready For Prime Time" under TBB 8. TBB - itself moving to Fx quantum may not be ready.

@_subject: [tor-talk] if browser remembers URLs visited before shutdown 
Sorry for this (one) top post - just wanted you & any others new to the Tor Browser & the whole family of software from Tor Project, not to be You cited a cookie or history issue in Firefox.  You expected Firefox history - accumulated during NON-private browsing, to be automatically cleared when (I assume) the private browsing session was ended or Firefox was closed.  That may or may not have anything to do with Tor Firefox in Private Browsing, probably shouldn't pull data from earlier non-private browsing, but you can just uncheck the options under Preferences > Privacy & Security to stop any history from popping up in the address bar.  And you can check desired options to delete when clearing history.  TBB deletes all data in that list (if any exists), if the "clear history" items are checked or not, but the time frame may need to be "everything."  In Firefox, time span needs to be = Everything, or it may not clear all history.
Unless an equivalent bug was filed in Tor Project's bug system and accepted,  and that bug is still "unfixed," it's highly unlikely such a Tor Browser bug exists.  By design, Tor Browser doesn't save data to disk across sessions.  You can *intentionally* protect some cookies.
I've used TBB many times NOT in Private Browsing; entered a few cookie exceptions for sites that I knew required them.  The specific sites set session cookies.  In TBB "Clear History" settings, when time frame is = "Everything," TBB still cleared cookies whether cookies were checked or unchecked to clear after shutdown. Intentionally protecting individual cookies, under Tor Button is an entirely different matter.
Most important: in Tor Browser Bundle *(TBB)* - the "browser" part of the bundle IS absolutely THE Mozilla Firefox browser (TBB uses Firefox "esr" versions).  The Firefox version has been *EXTENSIVELY modified* to increase anonymity, hide real IP addresses, NOT to give up a lot of data (like typical browsers often do) that may / can allow web sites / hackers / and adversaries against privacy, to identify internet users by several different methods. Tor itself, isn't a web browser.  It helps the browser connect to the  Tor network (that's very over simplified).
2) Your comments still sounds like you're trying to use another browser besides Tor Browser with Tor, to access the Tor Network!
Or just asking if TBB behaves the same as Firefox?
TBB does not behave the same as the standard Firefox, in many ways.
Some links to explain TBB design: Torproject.org_FAQ - Noreply Wiki  ; The Design and Implementation of the Tor Browser [DRAFT] * Using any other browser than Tor Browser with Tor, hoping to gain the same anonymity, privacy, reduced fingerprinting as "Tor Browser Bundle" isn't a good idea, nor recommended.  Don't use another browser with Tor, unless for experimenting or testing, when anonymity isn't a concern.  Countless modifications are made to the "base Firefox" to make "Tor Browser."  It's far easier, with better results to use TBB.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question for Roger (or someone): what is going on 
Sometimes NoScript toolbar / navbar icon is on the far left end - you
can move it in "customize mode."
Sometimes it's in the extra icons - shown when you open customize mode.
It could be under the "hidden icons" (the 2 chevrons, pointing right).
If those don't work, try removing the addon & reinstalling.
Scripts were always allowed.  Maybe not WebGl.  The official reason, way
back (I believe) was many sites wouldn't work & new users or less
concerned users might stop using TBB.  Another statement was the more
users alter anything in TBB, the more different they look.
It is true that other changes have been made in Firefox esr / TBB
version that counter act other settings.

NoScript?]
I just updated to TBB 9.0.2 Linux & saw what I guess mimble9 saw -
missing toolbar icons for NoScript.
I'm not sure I can recall the exact way I got the icon back.
Note: after TBB 9.0.2 update, the icons for HTTPS Everywhere & NoScript
were missing in addons manager screen.
Starting TBB in safe mode (w/o addons);
also disabling any addons, then restart normally, then enable addons &
another normal restart.
I believe those were the steps that made addon toolbar icon reappear,
but I'm not positive of the order.
Just disabling addon, restarting TBB & re-enabling addons didn't work
for me.
I assume this is a bug in TBB 9.0.2 installer, as I've not had this
issue in a long time, if ever.

I didn't read it closely, but I thought there was something in the changelog for TBB 8.0.5, that would allow users to save settings.
If it was supposed to be fixed, it's not working for me.  I still can't export settings.
I've played w/ copying the settings from NS Advanced tab - when "Debug" is checked under the Advanced tab.  Make the changes to NS you want, then select all in the window showing settings for the 3 levels.  Name it, date it - add enough info to file name so you'll know when it was taken, from which TBB version.  The NS settings look to be identical to NS in Firefox, if using the same settings.
The settings file "should" be able to export from *Firefox* & import into TBB, but that needs some testing.

If you need to save many custom colors for browser themes, web design, etc., AND save a color sample, it could be done in many word processors by adding a table, or in a spreadsheet.

Create the custom color in regular Fx or apps / websites with custom color generators & copy the hex or RGB color code into the table.
For the color sample of each value, use the word processor or spreadsheet's *background color* option, for the cell beside the color There should be a "select custom background color" option (tool), where a custom color value is entered & shows a small sample.

@_subject: [tor-talk] does tor-browser not use some country exits with some 
I hope I didn't already submit this question & forgot.
I'd been using TBB 8.0.3 a while - now in 8.0.4 (Linux).
A retail site said it couldn't deal with anyone outside the US.
It assumed from my exit node, I wasn't in the US.
So, modified the torrc file - which had a fairly long list of countries for ExitNodes {xx},{yy} (examples) specified to use.
Another 5 or 6 countries were under ExcludeExitNodes {aa},{bb} (examples), but not US.
I commented out all lines of the existing ExitNodes (and moved them near end of the file).
Then, added: ExitNodes {us}
The country {us} wasn't in any other active, non-commented lines.
But after re-reading what I already knew about specifying exit nodes, TBB refused to use exits in the US.
This was the edited torrc file:
It never would use any US exits - not by restarting or get-new-circuit or get-new-identity.
I'm positive the torrc syntax & spacing was correct.
Maybe because of the current Entry Guard's country location (Germany)?
Possibly a problem using an entry & exit - both in the "5 eyes" group? :)
When I reinstalled TBB to a new directory, started TBB once, then closed; added ExitNodes {us} in torrc again - same as before, but didn't have the commented out lines from the previous TBB installation, *then it used US exits.*  But, the guard's country was now different, due to a new TBB installation (no longer Germany).
I'm not sure if the problem was due to some Entry Guard + ExitNode combination, or something in the old torrc file it just didn't like?
This is the new torrc:

I've used the latest stable TBB 8.0.8 (Linux) since released with the
latest NoScript (at that time).
Today is the 1st day I saw that NoScript was disabled by TBB.
I see now that it's not a TBB only issue, but also Firefox.
A comment on Reddit said, "They [Mozilla] let their add-on signing
certificate expire and it invalidated a shitload of add-ons."
I assume it expired today?  When TBB & Fx checked for addon versions, it
saw the expired signing certificate.
There is a script listed on Reddit that supposedly will re-enable the
addons, but until Mozilla fixes the signing certificate bug, they said
the script would need running every 24 hrs.
There is a new NoScript version 10.6.1, but it wouldn't be tweaked for
TBB - downloading it from AMO or NoScript's site, even if it would install.
HTTPS Everywhere isn't tagged as a legacy addon for me, but it can't
update to the new version, either.

Last night I changed the about:config pref,

Last night, the pref change & restarting TBB made no difference in NS

addon was disabled.
This morning - on TBB's 1st start, the addons manager allowed *NS to
load* normally & the message now says: "NoScript could not be verified
for use in Tor Browser.  Proceed with caution."
Guessing Mozilla made a change so when Firefox contacts their addons
server, it doesn't disable addons - just shows a different warning?
The newest "Proceed with Caution" warning will likely confuse or concern
If it's a hard coded message, there may be no alternative. Otherwise,
"better" wording could be used.
Would it be possible when TBB automatically or manually checks for a
newer TBB version, to temporarily show a short explanation & a link to a
Tor Project page for some explanation?
Is HTTPS Everywhere (in TBB) not signed by Mozilla - rather by Tor
Project, thus no warning about it in the addons manager?

In TBB 9.0, should about:config "full-screen-api.enabled" be "true?"
It is =true by default, in my auto-updated TBB 9.0, in Linux Mint.
I also see similar (default value) prefs, that may / may not be involved
full-screen-api.allow-trusted-requests-only = true
(does that refer to "trusted requests" from sites, or something else?)
full-screen-api.transition-duration.enter = 0 0 (zeros separated by a
full-screen-api.unprefix.enabled = true
TBB 9.0 is the first version I remember that loading anything caused TBB
to go full screen - links, images, videos [non-flash, but played using
TBB HTML5 player].  Though apparently some things caused problems years
ago - see old bug.
  Found a several year old trac.torproject bug where some things caused
window resizing.
Is that pref's default value now back to true?
My security level is Safer and java script in NS is disabled.
But even to load text on some sites, at least the first party scripts
must be allowed.
Maybe js being enabled plus changes in Firefox allow scripts for some
content to force the (real) detected full screen size, when js is enabled?
But, I've not seen this problem (since TBB screen size was spoofed)
until upgrading to TBB 9.0.
For several reasons, like accidentally hitting the maximize window
button vs. close browser button, seems like there should be a pref ? or
setting that disables the maximize window icon.  That won't fix the
issue of some content making TBB go full screen.

I've actually seen that for a while.  Fortunately, it usually only takes

Often the new exit circuits countries are the same as the one they
complained about (but obviously not same IPa).
So maybe they are getting a lot of requests from certain exits, at a
given time.
Some days recently, I've stayed on YT for quite a while & they never
complained, so it's certainly not the Tor network.  But I excluded some
countries in torrc that have a worse than avg reputation as bad actors -

No problem.  Thanks for the info.
I haven't yet tried to see checked what screen size is reported, e.g.,
to EFF or browserspy.dk, etc., when a site (or content on it) requests
full screen.  Of course, I had to force full screen, then reload the
sites.  I'm not sure that gives same result as a site / content causing
full screen?
**What all prefs need changing to prevent ever going full screen?
Info Matthew pasted:
In this context, what does "inside a web app's origin" mean?
Instances of going full screen weren't common - but were random.
As far as "grant fullscreen...for a user initiated event," yes, I
clicked on links, but not 3rd party links or showed in status bar it was
from a different domain.  That's a strange way of putting it - "user
Without examining the page source in detail (most won't understand it)
users don't know or expect that clicking a random object on a site they
trust, might go full screen.  If I knew that ahead of time, I wouldn't
click such objects.  "User initiated" - when you ring a doorbell, you
don't expect it to spray toxic gas, though you initiated contact. I'm
not knowingly "giving consent" to anything to force full screen - it's
not the norm.
Testing TBB 9.0.1, when I force full screen (F11), then reverse it, TBB
goes back to the initial "screen size" - at least on Browserspy.dk.  It
displays blank white space / bands around the screen (NOT the same width
on L, R & bottom).  It also uses UP some of the available screen size -
with black bars on L & R of the screen.
The overall screen width detected, INCLUDING wide black bands is a
multiple of 200px, but I'm guessing an interested site could detect the
size that will display content.
After exiting full screen, the width that actually displays content is
an odd w=909 x h=900px, where 2 seconds before going full screen, the
detected size displaying content was 1000px W x 900px H.
So it's not just a matter of detecting real screen size.  It gives them
an odd value in a specific case.
If they can back calculate the vertical scrollbar width by using given
sized images, I don't see why they couldn't calculate the "usable"
screen width (screen width minus black bands).
It might be if users were simply asked / warned *before* screen size change.
It is if you don't want random sites or content - unexpectedly - causing
full screen & on exiting full screen, the usable display area is no
longer even multiples of 200 x 100.
They warn on accidentally changing the screen by 2px, but don't prevent
or warn BEFORE a change happens.  The warning process needs to prevent
size change, until users confirm the change.
My screen size changes are all accidental or from not being warned that
some content is asking for full screen mode.
That ticket's 5+ yrs old.  It's not helping.  Maybe there are much more
important issues (who runs entry / exit nodes).  I will probably disable
"full-screen-api.enabled" and others.
For now, why not add a button / setting in preferences or in... so users
can disable all screen changes (allowed by prefs), until progress is
made on ticket  Users not that worried about fingerprinting can
use default settings.
"full-screen-api.allow-trusted-requests-only" - there are no generally
"trusted requests" to go full screen, if you don't want to give up more
browser info.  Maybe OK for checking function of your own website or such.

function had gone hay wire, but a clean install also creates 2
profile.default folders.
Seems odd to create a 2nd profile w/ same name, so close to each other
in tree view.
The (partial or smaller) profile.default has *only 4* main folders:
cache2, safebrowsing, startupCache, thumbnails. Was there a serious need
to put those in a separate profile, same name, almost next to the
original profile.default?
In Linux, the smaller profile.default is at:

Meaning, verify with something other than checksums?
Another oddity after *auto updating* the existing TBB (10.0.6) to
10.0.7, was several folders & files showed modified dates = 1999-12-31.?
I'm not sure it hurt anything - I didn't test the auto updated v10.0.7
much, but it connected to the web.
Doing a full, clean install to an empty ~/.torbrowser folder with a D/L

modified date.
There are a few other folders or files w/ 1999 modified dates. There's
nothing wrong w/ my system clock or time. I don't see this date issue
with other packages.

after updating (not the startupCache in full profile) - based on file dates.
I updated TBB by clicking "update now" button on the "update is

I'm reporting this issue to see if others saw the same thing in the

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB "Security Level" Question. 
Reading documents like  answers a lot
of questions for newer TBB users.  Also, just as Firefox changes
constantly, TBB has ongoing changes.
I don't think that's true.  If you read the differences in the TBB
safety levels, it's fairly specific.  As for safety levels replacing NS,
there may be *some* overlap.
Forgetting JS for a moment, there are many things NS does that don't
involve JS, that are worth using, even if JS is turned on in NS by default.
Where does the NS icon appear for you?  The icon itself looks much the
same as in the 1st quantum version.  It used to be placed to the left of
URL bar - maybe still is, in a fresh install.  I always move it to the
right of the search bar.
The Safe, Safer or Safest levels have nothing to do with exit nodes used
by TBB.  The addresses of the exit nodes determine the IPa that sites
see, not java scripts.  Choose a different exit node, get a new IPa
(from Tor network exits).
Under "Learn More" or Advanced Security Settings, under Security Levels,
the Safer level says,
"Disables website features that are often dangerous, causing some sites
to lose functionality."
"JavaScript is disabled on non-HTTPS sites.Some fonts and math symbols
are disabled.Audio and video (HTML5 media), and WebGL are click-to-play."
It doesn't say if that's every feature it disables.
True, many sites won't work completely unless at least (some or all,
depending) of the scripts for the 1st level domain are allowed.  For
certain content on a given site, some 3rd party scripts must be enabled.
It depends on what content you want to see & its format, its source -
from 1st or 3rd party, etc. For instance, if you're reading plain text
or HTML, JS is generally not needed.
For one very big thing, TBB (and Tor and how the Tor network functions),
unhardened Firefox gives out much more info than TBB - even if TBB is on
Safe level.
It hides your true IP address, if users don't install certain addons
that sometimes may leak your true IPa.
It spoofs a lot of info given out in normal browswers, so the spoofed
data is the same for all TBB users.  Other data shown by browsers, TBB
may not give out at all.

Problems with TBB & YouTube were recently discussed on tor-talk.  Things
have changed fairly quickly.
Something new has developed for me.  1st, I don't visit YT daily or even
weekly, depending.
Until maybe 10 days ago, the site (often, not always) presented a
message about excessive traffic from the current IPa.
Before, for me, just getting a new circuit - maybe 1 to 3 times, made
things right.
Suddenly, that no longer worked.  Even if I forced using only U.S. exits
via torrc.
It appears the country location of exit being used isn't YT's only issue.
I started requesting new TBB identities & that worked on the 1st attempt
(most times) for 1 or 2 weeks.
Then getting new identities started failing to load the site.  I've also
recently seen a noticeable increase of other sites, large & small, that
refuse to load in TBB.  Allowing 1st party cookies or 1st party scripts
doesn't seem to matter for the majority of sites that won't load.
It's unclear if the exit relay's country was / is a factor - too little
testing by me to be conclusive.
But, I found that manually clearing TBB's cache in about:preferences,
THEN restarting TBB worked a high percentage of attempts.  Just getting
new identities was no longer enough; at least forcing new identities 6+
times, on a number of days.
It could be there are SO many Tor exits, in many countries with lots of
users doing things that YT considers abuse.  If that theory is correct,
YT's "issue" with TBB changed very suddenly - for me.
It makes me wonder if other recent changes in TBB, Tor or NoScript,
etc., is a main factor.
 From a simple probability stance, it's unlikely that for a few yrs, my
TBB was assigned only exits that YT considered good.  Then quite
suddenly, YT has a problem with dozens of exits in dozens of countries,
including U.S.
YT / Google could also have changed their policy - again - how they were
going to treat TBB or changed their definition of "abuse," so now there
are many more sites meeting their criteria of abusive. I also wonder if
Mozilla Fx changes on things like resisting fingerprinting are major
factors in more sites blocking TBB.

@ bo0od, not sure I follow.  Invidious means likely to cause unhappiness
or be unpleasant.
Does that have any relationship to invidio.us or similar sites?
Yes, you can D/L the videos, but you first have to get the URL.  I guess
if you saw a link on another site, your suggestion might make sense.  Or
if you use a proxy or VPN with regular Firefox - if YT worked with them.
Yes, I don't consider YT an adversary or even a site to keep health
information secret, etc.
I'm usually looking for how to "fix something" that I had nothing to do
with breaking. :)
I'm assuming that unless I suddenly started getting an out of proportion
percent of what YT considers bad or suspicious exits, something that
stores in (memory) cache, causes them to continue rejecting new exits,
until I clear the cache.
I haven't tried clearing it manually, then recording how often new
circuits vs. identities are successful.
To see the percent of success that clearing the cache has with a new
circuit or new identity (don't set cookies on YT).
I went a couple of yrs at least, with very few access problems - not
just on YT, but most technical sites I visit.  For me, it's not a huge %
increase of sites now blocking TBB, but a noticeable up tick.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Revisiting youtube blocking TBB, 
This is all very interesting.  I read several of the links (bugs & some
non-tor-talk forum questions on this general subject.
I've now had more time + paying more attention to my procedures &
typical results on youtube.
I can't explain what I'm seeing, since apparently in theory (unless it's
outdated info), getting a new identity should be equivalent to closing /
reopening TBB.
By now, it's seems safe to say that if I've visited any other sites
*before* loading YT in a new tab, the chance of YT *NOT* giving the
"suspicious activity" warning, is very low.
** Which begs the question, why would cached data from other sites
affect whether YT thinks the new exit shows suspicious behavior?
I DID discover just now, that the pref in my user.js file,
user_pref("browser.cache.disk.enable", false); - was NOT observed. In
about:config, browser.cache.disk.enable was True - bigger than Dallas.
Further, when I toggled it to False, that is the default setting.  I
can't 'splain why it wasn't using the user.js value.  It worked for yrs.
I've never seen it happen in any other browser.
In a VERY short trial just now (statistically meaningless), after
changing "browser.cache.disk.enable" = false, I still usually needed a
new identity for YT to load. I don't know what a new identity oc
clearing cache has to do with a site not visited since launching TBB
each day.
But a new identity WITHOUT clearing the cache rarely worked on YT. Can't
say the same about other sites.  I tried it enough times over weeks, to
see clearing cache AND a new identity almost always worked.  Question is
Just luck of getting bad exits when cache wasn't cleared before a new
identity, or getting VERY lucky - with "good" exits when cache WAS
cleared is statistically improbable.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Revisiting youtube blocking TBB, 
Contrary to your experience, I get more "are you human" delays, by
directly entering in a new tab:  than from
redirects or c&p URLs on YT's site.
I get relatively few "are you human" notices, if re-directed from other
site's links to YT.  That part may vary some, but it's far fewer times
than opening YT in new tabs, without FIRST clearing my cache AND getting
a new identity.
I've tried 5 - 10 new circuits, checking that the exit IPa changed. Once
they deny access *the 1st time,* changing circuits is much less
successful than clearing cache & a new identity.  I just don't know why
clearing the cache 1st is important, if YT can't read cache (sometimes
cookies) from other sites.  Maybe they know something we don't.  Won't
be the 1st time.
A new identity *w/o clearing cache* works less often, so it's easier to
do it first.  The exit relay's country doesn't matter too much. They
block lots of U.S. exits for me.
I don't know if it means they've seen lots of spamming, scraping, DoS
from the IPa's or what.  What ever it means, apparently YT now thinks
there's a LOT of it.

That's one way. Not as easy or fast as viewing short videos in a browser.
If I'm researching something technical, I may only watch a few seconds
or a minute till I see it isn't what I expected (from the title /
summary, etc.). Then immediately to the next.
I have had more consistent results w/ youtube & a few other sites by
clearing the cache & new identity.  I'll try 1x - 2x getting a new
circuit, as it's very quick.
Over time - at least for me, if that doesn't immediately fix their
block, I immediately clear cache & get new identity, or close the site,
if other sources exist.  So far, that's had a high success ration.

@_subject: [tor-talk] StartPage becoming Stop Page 
In the last week or 2 - well after TBB 9.0.9 release, StartPage quite
often shows "sorry to interrupt" page, asking if you're doing weird things.
Has a place to send comments, explanation.  An excerpt (emphasis mine):
It's not tied to exit nodes in certain countries, AFAIK.  As with
youtube, quickly trying new circuits 5+ times has mixed results.  I
imagine they've recently had bad experiences or changed policies.

@_subject: [tor-talk] >600 Tor relays without ContactInfo and similar 
Georg, could you explain / expand on your brief reply, if it's relevant
to anything being discussed (or that SHOULD be discussed)?
Is nusenu saying, 254? relays that Microsoft? used to run FOR the Tor
Network, dropped any MS name & re-appeared as nameless relays?? Or can
that be proved?
Where do the other ~ 350 nameless relays come from?
Is it a good idea for 600 relays to pop up in a short time (how short
was it)?
Wouldn't that possibly indicate a single or a few or a consortium of
If MS ran 250+ relays (sometime), is that good?? I don't think it's a
secret that MS was & likely still is sharing their ISP traffic data with
3 letter agencies.? That "fact" is long past conspiracy theory.
Tor Network / Devs has better ways to track, monitor or kick out relays,
than having no name - or random alpha-numeric names - yes?
What about users wanting to exclude nodes - including but not limited
to, relays with NO name or random character names or by other criteria
that users choose?
How hard is excluding select relays?? Excluding countries is easy.

@_subject: [tor-talk] U-tube new-er denial criteria? 
Quite recently, youtube has started showing more messages than in the
past, similar to: "Uh-oh We detected some unusual activity from your
address."? Once that happens, changing clearing all data, a new identity
& changing exit relays to other countries & IPa's (3, 5 or 10x) rarely
Sometimes it mentions "too many requests," but often not.? When it does,
it has to be others assigned the same relay as me, also visiting youtube
within a short period.
The "block" popups often show before I've looked at any or maybe one video.
They aren't age restricted or possibly offensive vids.? I've rarely seen
msgs: "Not available in your locale."
Seems this increased since last TBB update, more than I remember for
years. That could be coincidence, but...
It doesn't seem to matter if I have exits in US, CA, DE, UK - or others.
It's possible that exit relays from well behaved, but higher Tor use
countries or faster, higher use relays are hurting me instead of
helping?? Though I'm not selecting or excluding individual exits.
It's now sometimes happening after I close TBB completely, wait 10+
min., then make sure my exits AREN'T from same countries as when they
blocked me, by using custom torrc files.

@_subject: [tor-talk] One Less Site Blocking Tor (Browser) 
Excellent that the business had a local store & not too far?
Was it by any chance a locally owned store, not a chain or big corp??
I'm not sure that many large co's could or would change their policy
that fast - if it was THEIR policy, not a contract site maintainer's policy.
Now, only about 999,999,999 more sites to go that block TBB.
I've done similar things about TBB, but totally via the web. Mostly, I
don't get replies.
I don't look for TBB being accepted to catch on like wild fire, but any
progress is good.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB-10 cursors, pointers location 
This is in Linux Mint 18.1 - Cinnamon.
I know all cursor themes installed in my Mint installation.
After a fairly recent Tor Browser update - a few months?? ago, the
"default" mouse pointer TBB used and the weird "select live links"
pointer & others all changed to icons I've never seen. For years, it
used to use the Settings/ selected cursor theme -? same as all other apps.
Now, TBB is the ONLY app that doesn't use the selected cursor theme.
The normal pointer / arrow TBB is using, called "left-ptr" in most
cursor themes (e.g., normal arrow pointing up, to the left) is very tiny
& solid black.
On a dark BG, it's like the Halloween costume Mainway Enterprises sold,
"Johnny, Invisible Pedestrian"? (large black plastic bag).? I don't know
any installed themes with normal pointer arrows that small, much less
solid black.
I've searched all of TBB's folders, including extracted omni.ja, using a
search utility that normally finds anything, anywhere - if it exists. I
can't find cursor themes in TBB's package.? Even if TBB has its own
cursor theme, don't know why they're suddenly so small.
I installed a fresh TBB copy in a new directory under /home, but it does
the same thing.
Any ideas?

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB-10 cursors, pointers location 
Yes, Firefox (Mozilla's vers.) is installed & uses all custom cursor
themes I installed.
Edit: I jacked around with the default cursor theme, specified "default"
under */usr/share/icons/default*, where DMZ-Black has a "cursor.theme"
file.? For now, TBB uses the few cursor theme sets that shipped with
Mint. Either mostly white or black.
Seems TBB won't use any custom cursor themes even if they have the same
2 lines, same syntax, inside "cursor.theme" file as the stock cursor
themes.? That's probably a slight bug in TBB, as all apps *except TBB*
will use the 2 custom cursor themes I installed.
If Fx (Mozilla reg. version) uses the custom cursor themes, TBB / Fx esr
should be able to, unless TBB devs blocked it from doing so.
Unless I can figure out why TBB only uses cursor themes that shipped w/
Mint, I'll have to modify a few icons in the stock cursor themes &
replace them (change color; make some a bit thicker).? Now, some cursor
icons are barely visible on some pages or documents (like playing,
Where's Waldo?).? Which is why I installed the extra themes in the 1st

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB-10 cursors, pointers location 
I'll answer my own question, for anyone with this problem in the future.
I think there were several things going on.? There may be slight
differences in some Linux distros, how they want cursor themes installed;
the exact method & syntax of a file(s) specifying the default theme.? I
can only speak confidently how Linux Mint 18 handles cursor themes.
Apparently, one problem was permissions - on the
folder, containing all cursor theme images.? Extracting the theme in
question (from zip file, like many 3rd party cursor themes), didn't make
or set permissions on the "cursors" folder, same as native or repo
installed cursor themes.
Lots of cursor theme tutorials say you MUST add (or edit) a
the default folder, containing:
Even though that line is often found in the "cursor.theme" file in repo
installed & 3rd party cursor themes.
Most of the articles, posts I read were about *Mint v18.x or 19.x, w/
Cinnamon*.? Most were wrong on how to set a default cursor theme / where
Mint 18.x -Cinnamon would look for this value.
In Mint 18.x w/ Cinnamon DE, TBB & all apps I checked (even if running
under Wine) use the cursor theme selected in Settings > Themes > "mouse
pointer," which is stored under "cursor-theme" in dconf path:
*org.cinnamon.desktop.interface.*? Or the same dconf path for Gnome DE, etc.
