Maybe a trust model? Ie like Facebook.. I trust my friends.. they trust
their friends... Removes some anon a bit ... but if you have 3 levels as I
believe TOR does should provide some reasonable level of anonymity and maybe
what is sacrificed could be recompensated by other means.

On face value it does - but I wonder if we might find ways to compensate for
that. More hops maybe. Before TOR existed I gave thoughts to a file sharing
system which otherwise was similar to TOR but worked on a friend basis. My
idea was for politically oppressed, no one had a complete file, but only
pieces and was anonymous anyways.
There are issues - but I think given the status of TOR and where its headed
now it might be worth some research. People could offer to be introducers,
or allow certain "new" people on at a risk..
Actually I think we might gain performance in many cases.
Adding someone would not add all your friends - but instead your friend
relationship would allow your friend to relay through you - and then on to
your friends.  Your friends would never know who your other friends are.
If someone is bad, you simply boot them and revoke their trust. Since you
are their relay, your friends are now protected because you have booted
them. The idea is that each person would have relay access to all of their
friends, would relay to their friends etc.. After 3-5 hops.. the numbers
could be quite big.

Anyone else interested in this? I'm a coder, unfortunately I do not like C
(nor C++) so I can't help out much there... How big is the TOR code?
The idea would be that your trusted friends would not be your endpoint exit
node, just your firstpoint into a TOR network. And your endpoint exit nodes
would be friends of your friends friends. (3 levels, or more). While not
passing back who your friend's friends are, statistics such as how many
friends they have could be passed back to determine how many exit nodes you
eventually would have... thus you may choose 3 hops... and see that maybe
there are not enough endpoint exit nodes for your taste... so then you could
specify more hops.

@_subject: Not using slow circuits (was Re: Tor slow no matter what I do.) 
Does TOR implement QOS or prioritization? That is only use bandwidth when
other traffic is not present?

Ive tried TOR on several computers now. Ive tried it from several locations
(countries) on all sorts of broadband.
Every attempt, it is slow. But I don't mean just slow as in bothersome, as
in unusable. Most web pages time out. I travel to Africa a lot - and dialing
in on a slow modem connection at 9600 bps is way better than I've ever
achieved on TOR with broadband.
Surely it cannot be this bad else no one would use it. What am I missing?

I just did as it says here.. Only basic tests, but wow! TOR is usable so
