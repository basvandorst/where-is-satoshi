If you're comfortable building from source on your PPC machine, I've  just been doing that and copying the four executables into Vidalia.app/ Contents/MacOS. So far it's seemed to work fine, and I get to keep the  nice Vidalia interface and folder structure (ie, you won't have to  dick around moving your torrc or data directories, etc). It's been  holding me over so far.
Because I like to tinker, and since the PPC version of Vidalia is out  of date, I'd thought about building Vidalia itself from source, but    isn't working for me. Is the current source publicly available at  the moment?

Out of curiosity, how long are you letting these tests run for? My  nodes generally take a full 2 or 3 days to get up to full capacity,  and even then, traffic through them has its sporadic highs and lows.  But then, I also run nodes on the lower end of the bandwidth scale, so  I'm not sure how things compare...

I see this as well in the 1.3.13 Browser Bundle on Windows XP. Odd.

@_subject: NoScript, Tor and Firefox 
As per the Browser Bundle's download page: "The Tor Browser Bundle is  under development and not yet complete." Now, I don't have much (any)  experience with the Browser Bundle, but I imagine it doesn't come with  NoScript because it breaks functionality. Blocking JavaScript, Java,  Flash, XSS, etc etc are great for security, but the more of that you  disable, the less functional many websites become. This can break the  "plug and play" nature of the Browser Bundle.
It's my understanding that the Browser Bundle lets you use Firefox  over Tor via Torbutton, without the hassle of having to set up  Firefox, Tor, or Torbutton on the computer you're using. That said, it  only provides those benefits unless you enhance your own security. If  you are doing something that requires extreme privacy, and can't risk  your HTTP or other unencrypted traffic being snooped on at the exit  node (when accessing the "regular" internet), then you'll need to take  measures to encrypt it. Forcing the use of HTTPS was the subject of  the previous discussion you were quoting from, and setting up custom  NoScript rules is one way of doing that. Granted, it often breaks the  functionality of certain websites.
You're correct in thinking that this is somewhat less of an issue when  accessing Tor Hidden Services, as traffic never leaves the (encrypted)  Tor network. I'm sure, depending on the type of service run, that  there are ways of maliciously gathering information about clients, but  historically I don't believe this has been an issue (someone please  correct me if I'm wrong).
I can't comment on this, not having as much experience as I'd like  with Polipo.
Your anonymity is improved in the sense that (theoretically) all  traffic bound for Tor is encrypted, and any traffic that would  normally be unencrypted (without Tor) is now coming out some exit node  that could be anywhere in the world and has no obvious connection to  you. This is called "Speakeasy" security, and it only takes you so  far. For example, sending your bank account details in an unencrypted  (plaintext) email over Tor isn't particularly any safer than doing so  without Tor, as anyone spying on an exit node could pick it up and  have a field day with it. Tor isn't magic. If you're dealing with  sensitive information, act as though you weren't using Tor at all and  take appropriate security measures to protect your information. With  that done, Tor is simply the icing on the cake (delicious, delicious  cake I might add).
Anytime :-)

@_subject: Downloading attachments with Tor - is this secure? 
I believe the answer you're looking for is  here: This depends on where you're downloading from. Tor encrypts everything between you, the clients in your circuit, and the exit node. However, when traffic enters or leaves the exit node, it is *exactly* as if the exit node were visiting that website for itself. So, if you are downloading over standard HTTP, *nothing between the website and the exit node will be encrypted*. This usually isn't a terrible problem with downloads that don't contain any personal information that leads back to you, as it would be extremely difficult to follow the encrypted data over several hops through the network.
*However*, as the documentation says repeatedly, use HTTPS wherever possible, *especially* when communicating sensitive information that could lead back to you. This way, the traffic between the exit node and website is encrypted, and doubly so between you and the exit node. Much less will be gained by examining the traffic coming to/from the exit. Hope that answers your questions.
(Side Note: the above does not pertain to .onion websites or other hidden services, which are contained completely within the network.)

@_subject: Downloading attachments with Tor - is this secure? 
I believe this is the short answer to your question, though everything else Mike said is good to keep in mind as well, especially in situations where paranoia is appropriate.
Watch out for this. Yahoo's *login* page for webmail and other services may be HTTPS, but this reverts to plain HTTP once you're actually viewing your mail and downloading attachments. A simple solution for secure webmail at the moment is using Gmail and the new Firefox addon "HTTPS-Everywhere" available from  . This addon is *NOT* magic, as it only works with the particular list of websites available on its option page, but making sure "Google Services" is checked in it's options will allow all Gmail connections (including downloading attachments) to happen over HTTPS.

Without the community support, I wonder how quickly it could be  adopted. I'm assuming it's going to rely on user-run exits like Tor,  and I wonder how many large contributors would be willing to install  closed-source software that they're not involved in developing on  their servers.
Haters' gonn' hate. I'll admit, though, that using bridges might be a  bit above the "average" user, especially when it comes to finding  them. Not exactly plug-n-play. I also don't see why it would be  terribly difficult for a sufficiently determined government to amass a  large list of bridges and make that option essentially (if not  completely) inviable.
I am a tad unnerved at the number of links to the donation page,  though I appreciate the costs associated with such an endeavor.

@_subject: [OT] another proxy, but not open source :-( 
I'll admit I could be totally off base. But it's 5 in the morning and I honestly can't think of another way they could implement what they're trying to do (effectively, anyway) without an enormous infrastructure. Cheapest way to create one seems to be distributing your free software and having your users act as... oh wait, somebody thought of that already!
Maybe I've been out of the game for too long, but in my experience proprietary software is used either because it works well, or because it comes with support (i.e. insurance). The Windows servers, for example, work well in corporate environments running a large number of Windows machines in a Domain, and often said corporation will purchase support to go with it. It's worth the cost to keep things running (somewhat) smoothly. If you have a free alternative that works just as well and can be maintained by your staff without too much ado, odds are it will be used. Apache on *nix comes to mind as one example, as opposed to IIS.
So if we have two free softwares, one open-source and one closed-source, neither with any *explicit* support, the choice is going to come down to which one works better, and which one looks better. If they put out a crappy product, odds are it'll get uninstalled by the majority of users who just don't want to bother fucking with it. If it's a decent product, however, and it has a decent UI, and their production team can keep up with releases and bugfixes and whatnot, we may be in for some viable competition. We'll see. Somehow I doubt it.
The picture in my head reminds me of this, for some reason: As an aside, they do have a shiny-looking website, and I won't pretend users aren't attracted to that. We could do with a little shininess ourselves. Still though, pandering for donations when you're not even offering any sort of product or service... honeypot indeed.

Maybe it's just me, then. I tend to assume that anything not on the official website isn't sponsored by the official project, unless they make a point of explicitly saying "Sponsored by...". If that's not as general an assumption as I would think, then perhaps it does bear making the point clear.
Fair enough, that is a tad misleading.
This will be a contention point. Most of me hopes this is an honest effort at contributing to the Tor project. Of course, that hope includes the big assumption of things like, all donations being used to cover costs (no profit), and all sponsors getting their donations back if the new relays never get off the ground. Big hopes and big assumptions; time will tell I suppose.
Again, maybe it's just me, but it was clearly visible on my screen when I brought the page up. I haven't seen anything come out of his own mailing list yet, but you can be sure I'll be watching it closely. Cautious optimism is the way to go with any new project like this, methinks.

@_subject: gwget and tor? 
I don't know about gwget, but plain wget supports http proxies, which you can point at Polipo. If you're only going to need to do this every once in a while, I'd pop open a terminal and do the following:
HTTP_PROXY=127.0.0.1:8118 && HTTPS_PROXY=127.0.0.1:8118 && export HTTP_PROXY && export HTTPS_PROXY && export FTP_PROXY
wget your://url.to/download.here
If that doesn't work for you, open your Polipo configuration file and see what port it's set up to run on, and change the bit after the colon in the environmental variables. Wget will pick up on the environmental variables and should route your download through Tor. These settings will only last until you either close the shell, or until you log out (I forget which and can't make it to my linux box to check), so if you'll be doing this a lot you can add the following lines to your .wgetrc file to have them executed automatically:
proxy = on
HTTP_PROXY = 127.0.0.1:8118
HTTPS_PROXY = 127.0.0.1:8118
FTP_PROXY = 127.0.0.1:8118
To resume an interrupted download, just add the -c option, like so:
wget -c your://url.to/download.here

This may be borderline nitpicking, but a nice feature I've noticed when configuring my PPC machines is that Vidalia catches a line from the log starting "Your Tor server's identity key fingerprint is...".

I missed that line in the OP. Since my particular machine runs a  single user and is logged in 24/7, I simply run the Vidalia package as  a relay and set it to start on login. Since this package is the one I  imagine the majority of Tor users on OSX will be running, it would be  nice to see it updated to 2.2.18a/0.2.10. Not to mention that the  switch to Intel processors was a relatively recent one, as far as  computer turnover goes, and there are still plenty of users out there  running PPC machines.
I agree that dropping the expert packages might be a good idea, but I  don't see a reason that the Vidalia bundles should fall behind.

This may also be a given, but did you restart Tor after doing this?  AFAIK (and I may be wrong), Tor does not read changes made to the  torrc after initialization.
Was Vidalia running when you edited the torrc? Vidalia (on Windows, at  least) has a bad habit of overwriting changes to the torrc that it  isn't aware of. Personally I think there should be a "Confirm before  modifying torrc" checkbox in Vidalia.
Try shutting down both Tor and Vidalia, making your edits, restarting  both, and rechecking your torrc/logs. If you've done all this, please  let us know.

@_subject: Tor Bundle vs. Vidalia Bundle 
What they "have" to do depends on what you're trying to do. The Tor  program by itself does the legwork of building circuits and passing  data to/from the network. It has no GUI and acts based on settings in  the torrc text file. Tor is available on its own in the "Expert  Packages" section of the download page, as the only people using Tor  on its own are likely bridge, relay, and exit operators who know what  they're doing. It's not a "bundle" per se.
Vidalia is GUI program that interacts with Tor and makes its settings  easier to handle, along with other nifty features such as viewing the  network, logs, etc. The "Vidalia Bundle" on the download page is  designed to be installed on a computer you'll be using Tor on  regularly. That is, it isn't "portable", can't easily be carried with  you on a USB key or CD, and doesn't come with an internet browser. The  bundle includes Polipo, which makes funneling HTTP and SOCKS proxies  into Tor easier and safer.
The "Tor Browser Bundle" (the bundle I assume you're talking about in  your post) is the same set of programs, together with a locked-down  version of Firefox, that it designed to be completely portable. You  don't have to install it, so it's easy to carry with you on a USB key  or CD. Tor, Vidalia, Polipo, and the customized Firefox are all  seamlessly started with a single button in this package.
All of this information is available on the download pages and in the  documentation, I'd recommend reading through them.

The very first thing I would try is simply getting rid of the files  and allowing Tor to recreate them. Personally I'd shut down Tor and  delete the 'lock' and 'state' files, along with any file or folder  starting with 'cached', and then restart Tor. Make sure not to touch  the 'keys' folder or the 'fingerprint' file.
If the issue shows up again, the next thing I'd try is double-checking  the permissions on the Tor appdata folder, along with *every folder  above it down to the root*. I had a similar issue trying to run Tor as  a system service where I needed to grant the system service user  explicit permissions to every folder leading up to the Tor appdata  folder. I haven't played with Vista permissions, though, so YMMV.

Fair enough. Better one more working node on the network than a broken one you don't have time to play with.
I can only speak of my own experience running the alpha on my WinXP machine, which has been flawless so far, but this is the first time I've seen this particular error mentioned, so I'm not convinced it's a problem inherent in the alpha. That said, alpha builds are listed as unstable for a reason, and I don't keep myself updated on all the bug reports, so a grain of salt is warranted. I'm assuming that you downgraded your Tor bundle by using the packaged uninstall utility, which on Windows deletes all settings directories by default. These would have been recreated when you reinstalled the old version, which *could* have corrected some permissions issues. I'm wondering if reinstalling with the alpha version would have yielded the same results.
Or something else entirely about your setup could be giving Tor indigestion. It's really a "poke it until it works" sort of situation (and I encourage a good and thorough poking if/when you get the time).

My bad. These files only show up when one is running a bridge/relay/exit node. The majority of my work with Tor is setting up and running exit nodes, so I'm in the habit of thinking about installations in that light. These files won't show up if you're only accessing the Tor network as a client.
Based solely on the two errors I've seen from your logs, I can only guess that there is either some sort of permissions issue (which could include a rogue process, possibly Tor itself, changing permissions while Tor is running), or that some process is accessing the lock/state files and preventing Tor from interacting with them properly. I chose the "nuke the unnecessary files" approach first because if it worked, it'd be the quickest and easiest fix. The slightly-more-involved approach would be checking permissions, etc. The pain-in-the-ass approach would be rooting around in your system trying to find out what's going on, filing bug reports, etc etc.
I tend to start with the quick & easy attempt at fixing the problem because I'm exceedingly lazy =)

Perhaps I don't understand what you're going for here. If a user is using https (or another client-server encryption protocol), then a "bad guy" viewing traffic without the onion-layer encryption would simply see more encrypted traffic. Even if the user does not (or cannot) use https-like protocols, because each node does not know where along the circuit it lies, this is no more useful than passively monitoring an exit-node's traffic for information. That said, there are plenty of warnings on the project website about this: tor is not magic, and users need to be careful that any unencrypted traffic does not contain any personally identifiable information.
The volunteer model is exactly what keeps tor afloat: nodes appear and disappear all the time, and traffic to many of them looks innocuous, as if they were connecting to any other computer on the net. See below.
There are many bridges that are only distributed on request via  and via email to bridges at torproject.org. These change dynamically enough to keep most users connected. Where access is blocked, mirrors and relays can be found with a little fenangling about search engines.
See above. As I understand it, as soon as a client can connect to a single bridge, they can then obtain enough information to build circuits without needing to refer to any central authority.
Tor bridges and exits are in no way limited to port 443. My exits currently use port 9001, with directory mirrors on port 9050; this is the purpose of the orport and dirport lines in the torrc. I'm not qualified to comment on why the rest of your proposal would or would not be a good idea.
Again, not qualified. I hope someone will provide a better answer to this.

I've been running "Japnonymous" on a 10.4 ppc machine using this  package for some time now. Haven't run into any issues yet (Full  disclosure, I don't use Polipo at all, only Tor and Vidalia).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Turning off all logging - how? 
I'm not sure if this is supported by default (please correct me if I'm wrong), but it should be fairly easy to hack. I'd add the following line to your torrc:
Log err file /dev/null
which would produce the minimum amount of output (fatal errors only), all of which would be immediately discarded. I'd also add --quiet to whatever command you have starting Tor, which will suppress the console messages that are produced before the torrc is parsed.

@_subject: Per-Tab Torbutton 
So far this is not possible, no. There is an ugly, but workable, solution in using Firefox's profile manager. By creating two separate profiles in the profile manager (by running Firefox with the -profilemanager switch) and creating two shortcuts/links with respective -P "yourprofilename" switches, it is possible to run two separate instances of Firefox, one of which is free to use Torbutton while the other does not.
Until Firefox provides a way to isolate tabs as individual processes, I don't see such a feature being implemented.

I've been meaning to ask about this for awhile. Is it more helpful to the network to have (using this example) a node running at 100KB/s for 12 h/d, or limit it to 50KB/s and have it run 24/7? At what point does speed outweigh uptime (or vice versa)?

@_subject: Excluding exit nodes 
I think it's worth mentioning that as an end-user you might be focusing on the wrong issues here. While there *may* be some nodes (exactly which is perpetually unknown) that record unencrypted traffic, it's more important to make sure that your private data (such as login credentials, text containing your whereabouts, etc) is encrypted end-to-end than to worry about excluding every "possibly bad" exit node. For example, it's much easier to use the https version of a website instead of http to protect a username/password combination than it would be to hunt down anyone who might be trying to record your http connection (as recording the encrypted https traffic would yield them nothing). The same logic applies to other tools as well, examples being using the encrypted ssh and sftp over telnet and ftp, respectively.
See  if you haven't already.
To answer your other question, as I understand it, the traditional definition of "bad" exit nodes has been ones that manipulate (actually change, rather than simply record) data as they pass through the node. These nodes are automatically awarded the "BadExit" flag and are not used as exits, so the end-user need not worry about them. Exactly whether using an asinine exit polixy should cause a node to be considered malicious has been a point of argument over the last week or so here, and relates only to the sniffing of unencrypted traffic. So again, make sure to use encrypted protocols wherever possible, and don't send any personally-identifiable information when forced to use unencrypted protocols, and you should be fine.
Others will be better able to answer the other questions you had. Good luck, and stay safe!

@_subject: Polipo bug reporting 
I may be wrong about this, but I believe it's more of a software issue than a hardware one. The last version of Xcode produced for 10.3 is known to produce some wonky, apparently random errors in some applications when they are run on 10.4 and 10.5. I imagine that 10.4 and above are much more prevalent on current live machines (although I'd love to see some hard data either way on that one), so given one dedicated PPC build machine I imagine the emphasis should be placed on producing stable applications for 10.4 and 10.5 (10.6 being Intel-only). Xcode for 10.5 is known to produce applications that play fairly nice with 10.4, but again, things sometimes get wonky with 10.3 (and then again, sometimes not).
That's not to say, of course, that if you happened to find and old mac and some 10.3 disks laying around, that a donation wouldn't be appreciated =)

@_subject: Is "gatereloaded" a Bad Exit? 
Although I've been keeping out of this argument for the most part, and even though I'm leaning towards seeing things Mike's way, I just wanted to comment that I've actually been in an environment like this several times, once at my previous university, and once working for a local government organization. As asinine as such reasoning is on the part of the network administrator (or the person who signs their checks), I can see why the *ability* to run strange exit policies could be a good thing, and should be preserved in the software.
However, I see no reason why providing an anonymous contact email would be so hard. Certainly if you're going out of your way to avoid [insert conspiracy of choice] in order to run a node, you have the skills to use one of the hundreds of free email services out there? I don't think asking for a tiny bit of responsibility on the part of exit operators is too much to ask, and I'm amazed that "allow them to continue to function as middle nodes until they explain why their node appears broken or malicious" is continually being turned into some kind of human-rights ~Justin Aplin

You're welcome, I'm sure there are plenty more out there.
If you recall, I never suggested a nym, as I have no idea how such a thing would be constructed. The idea, however, was that if one were under this sort of threat, requiring constant vigilance to avoid, don't you think that running an exit node full of unsecured traffic would attract *far more attention* than one would want? We're reaching pretty far into left-field as far as this argument goes, but seeing how exit operators are *asked* (not required) to *volunteer* their time and bandwidth in order to help *others* (and not themselves, except as an incidental increase in obfuscating traffic) who need the network for *exactly* the sort of life/death, jail/freedom situations you're describing, how is it not reasonable to ask that these operators be Just a thought; if you have any interest in being taken seriously and aren't just trolling the list, sarcasm and expletives may not be the way to go.

@_subject: Is "gatereloaded" a Bad Exit? 
I hate to continue a clearly dead-end argument, but have you ever volunteered, well, *anywhere*? If I were, say, volunteering to build houses for the homeless, and I started going off on my own, ignoring all guidelines, and hammering around wherever the fuck I wanted, I'd expect to either be asked what the hell I was doing (and allowed to continue given good reasoning), or be booted off the project. "I have my reasons for doing this, trust me" is not good enough. The same logic applies to nearly any volunteer or community service situation you could get yourself into. You wouldn't be allowed to re-arrange books at a library without explaining yourself, just as you shouldn't expect to run a broken- or malicious-looking Tor node without a heads-up to the community.
Running a node is indeed a community service; however, all community service requires some degree of responsibility. If you're really in a position where such a responsibility would endanger you (or you're simply defiant to the point of rebelling against responsibility when you're told it's expected of you), then yes, I expect you to be limited to the "safe zone" of being a middle node until you explain yourself or grow the hell up.

@_subject: torr file question... 
Simply edit the torrc while both Tor and Vidalia are closed. Vidalia edits the torrc file when changes are made using its interface; upon starting up, however, I believe it gathers its parameters directly from the torrc. In my experience when I write a custom torrc with Tor and Vidalia closed, and then start Vidalia (which in turns starts Tor), my custom torrc is overwritten, but upon careful observation of the new file, it can be seen that each of my settings remains the same, although reordered and with added header comments.
I do wish there was a "do not edit torrc" or "confirm before editing torrc" option in Vidalia, but generally the changes it makes are harmless. C'est la vie.

Before he goes through all that trouble, wouldn't it be worth just SOCKSifying Firefox to use Tor directly, rather than Polipo? If it's some hidden cache issue with Polipo, the issue would disappear then, no? Also he mentions opening a new tab, but never says he cleared the Firefox cache; could Firefox itself simply be fishing the page up from memory? A simple tools > clear everything would be a decent test.

In a roundabout way, yes. Torbutton forwards Firefox traffic to Polipo, which in turn sends the traffic to the SOCKS port of Tor. Disabling Torbutton and entering the Tor SOCKS information into Firefox's network configuration would skip the Polipo part, and eliminate any problems you might be having with some hidden Polipo cache.
Everything else you mentioned points to you using Firefox and Tor properly, I'd try either skipping Polipo (really only a testing solution, as by not using Torbutton, you lose all the other goodies it gives you (beyond simple SOCKS configuration), and would have to change Firefox's network config every time you wanted to use or stop using Tor). If it's indeed a Polipo problem and that fixes it, Geoff's solution seems like it would make a rather nice permanent solution for you. You could skip right to that if it sounds easier than screwing around with Firefox's network configuration.
Simply close the process. The memory cache disappears along with the rest of the rest of the process. No fenangling necessary.

I'm not sure how that's arrogant at all. These nodes aren't exit-flagged, have suspicious (though maybe not damning) "exit" policies, and have no or fake contact information. They're either malicious or horribly configured, and in either case there's no way to get in touch with the operators. Strong odds are they're doing the network (and its goals) more harm than good, so they're removed from it (note that there was no IP ban, so the operators are free to return to the network if they so choose). Honestly, it seems to me that this is the Tor Project equivalent of a slap on the wrist; a much stronger, more irrational decision could certainly have been elicited.
I'm operating under the assumption that we run our nodes to further the goals of the Tor Project and help the community. I'm not sure why removing exits with idiotic or malicious configurations (until the operator either fixes them or explains themselves) is a bad thing.

@_subject: [tor-talk] how to install torrent tor 
It was my impression that his original question was a badly-worded  variation on "Firefox works over Tor, now how do I get torrents to  work over Tor?". The answer depends on which client you're using. To  date, I haven't seen a Bittorrent client specifically designed with  Tor in mind, but then, since I find wasting huge amounts of exit  bandwidth in this way a little distasteful, I haven't exactly been  looking. uTorrent, however, is fairly easy to configure properly, so  I'll use it as an example.
In the "Connection" section of uTorrent's preferences, set the proxy  server options to "HTTP", "127.0.0.1", and "8118" respectively to  bounce traffic through Polipo (Which I'm assuming you installed with  the Vidalia Bundle). If you don't have Polipo installed, you can set  the proxy server options to "SOCKS", "127.0.0.1", and "9050"  respectively to route traffic directly into the Tor client. I'd make  sure "Resolve hostnames through proxy" is checked, and although I  cringe at the thought of using so much of the network's bandwidth, I  suppose "Use proxy server for peer-to-peer connections" is the magic  checkbox you're looking for. (All this assumes you haven't changed any  of the default ports).
But really, a simple Google search of " over Tor"  or similar will yield you much more specific results, with pictures,  even. The question is so general it's really hard for us to answer it  ~Justin Aplin

Odds are, if it's not listed on the page, it hasn't been tested. OpenWRT should support your devices [1], so once that's installed the easiest thing you could do is try to install the package and see what happens. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work; at least, not without a fair bit of tweaking and recompiling on your part.
I've never used DD-WRT, but off the top of my head I would say it's because OpenWRT has a persistent file system and a package manager, whereas DD-WRT doesn't (which makes installation a pain in the ass, and you'd lose your Tor install with every reboot).
