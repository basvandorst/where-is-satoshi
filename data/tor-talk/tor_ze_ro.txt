@_subject: My tor exit node is gone from the node list? 
Hi there,
For several months, we've been running a tor exit node (kyirong/A8BD 32A9 C2F2 0C4F 8ED2 C26C E477 0A24 85E3 CD22). Since a few days, it seems to have vanished from the list of nodes, and I cannot make it reappear. Neither notice.log nor debug.log (when enabled) show any suspicious entries or error messages:
Apr 28 15:22:08.357 [notice] Tor 0.2.1.14-rc (r19307) opening log file.

Nothing else shows up after that, while debug.log is constantly being written to. Also, traffic logs suggest that the node is not used as much as it could be.
Whats up with that?

Yes, they are.
Also, the way to go would probably be a third-party utility that download all required
updates to install them later, offline. One that I can think of is c't Offline Update:

I haven't had the time and sufficient knowledge to work out what's wrong, but for
some reason the node is back online for a 'record' of nearly 48 hours now:

Hi list, hi Lee,
I have again spoken to my ISP and they say routing is fine.
I'm interested in that as well. I still cannot get it to be flagged
'Running' reliably.
Would TOR logging on my side help on this? I guess not?
Appreciate any help, I'm sure you don't mind getting 4MB/s exits back. ;-)

@_subject: My tor exit node is STILL gone from the node list 
Hi list,
I am still struggling to get my server back on the list of Tor nodes. For several months it
was among the top 5 nodes, pumping 15TB a month. I am paying a lot of money for that machine,
and I don't see why it just doesn't work any more.
Let me reiterate what's happening: Since April, the node disappears from the node list after a
few hours of running. I have tried to change exit policies, node name, node keys, ports and IP
(within the same subnet). After the IP change the node was listed (and used) for several hours
before it vanished. There's nothing about in the log file.
It seems as if the node is unreachable from some of the authority servers, but I have no idea
what to do about that. My ISP says that routing is fine and everything should work as
expected. I don't understand why the node stays listed for a few hours before disappearing.
Can someone please help me get this >100EUR/mnth node up again?
Information about the node:
Current IP 89.248.169.109 (previously 89.248.169.108)

It at least shouldn't be a problem for TOR, because it has worked with that setup for months. To avoid further confusion, I have enabled answers to ICMP requests.
The IP has no PTR record.

I have limited experience in running servers. From what I found out, my Xen dom0 is traceable
(89.248.169.106), while the virtual host running TOR is not (89.248.169.109, vif-bridge). I can
still access the web server running on 109 though.
Is this a Xen misconfiguration? I can't think of anything that I have changed.

Hi Lee,
I haven't spoken to them, no. What I did was reconfigure the firewall to allow
ICMP. Could it be momentarily routing problems that cause this? At the moment,
the node seems to be, too.

Hi Timo,
I basically got it from
and slightly modified the template. Feel free to use it.
I don't know of any multilingual approaches, but I guess it would be nice
to have that.

I didn't change anything. The node is "up", eg. moria flags it as "Running",
but as you said it disappeared from the concensus again shortly after being
reported up. I can traceroute the main server (.106), but not the dom0 (.109).
I will contact my ISP now with that information.

I agree that having a central list is highly problematic, because several sites will request
to take them off that list. But I also think that the Tor network will benefit from such a
list in the long term by having more exit nodes that at least allow many po****r sites.
It might even stimulate people to try out running an exit node and turn it into a less restricted node later on.
Sure, and they of course still should be. I don't think the number of "open" exits will drop,
and in theory there's more available bandwidth because other exit nodes take all the
"heavy" traffic (search engines and the like).
I must say that I like the idea behind this.

I am still trying to solve this. Since my last mail, I also let TOR regenerate the keys, so kyirong's fingerprint now is 849D 45A3 2335 5EB3 4F73 2EF5 DB43 0B90 6A21 DAAE (89.248.169.108, DirPort 80, ORPort 8010; uptime 24/7). It is still not listed. The node is reachable from multiple locations (judging from my limited way of testing). If someone can give me hints towards unreachable routes, I can ask my ISP about that.
Any ideas on what to try next?

I have spoken to my ISP, they're not aware of any routing errors and do
not filter. From my limited testing from multiple locations, I can always
reach the server.
Port 443 is already in use by the Apache web server.

Hi Andrew,
Since I posted the message to the mailinglist, I tried with a
different ORPort (8010), which made the node reappear on the list
for a while - but it is again gone now. The process is stilling
running and actively writing to the debug log (the notice log
doesn't change after the self-tests).
