cmeclax-sazri> Should we design a remailer that uses Tor in some way?
I spent a little time over the holidays working out how to get Postfix
to talk on the Tor network for both sending and receiving messages
[1][2]. It seems to work well and was easy enough. This means email
can be exchanged between hidden mailservers. I would imagine this sort
of thing to be useful for, say, NGOs and people in the field to have
a secure decentralised email infrastructure. A similar technique may
well be part of a remailer setup.
I wonder how the nym proposals would figure with this, because whilst
you can send mail to ww at nnfd3wq5uvctzuib.onion and I can reply from
there, it's hardly memorable. I think to be viable it would need the
moral equivalent of an MX lookup on a nym.

Or use the lsof(1) program, as in,
   lsof | grep TCP
