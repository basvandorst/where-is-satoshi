@_subject: [tor-talk] Self-deleting scripts in http connections 
Greetings, all.
Recently, as I was browsing over to coppersurfer dot tk , I on a whim opened up Firefox's Element Inspector (right click -> Inspect Element (Q)) . Imagine my surprise when I find a script before the title tag. (see pastebin HNqsDsq2 for sourcedump).
Given that I have NoScript, I needed to test it. Restarting with addons disabled made the script not appear by the time I managed to open the Element Inspector again. Given that Tor is based on Firefox, the ability for a site to remotely delete a script from a client browser is worrying. Is anyone willing to double check that this happens to more than just myself?
A concerned netizen.

My apologies for lateness, had to life and determine the source of this A) I don't know the exit node I used in Tor, nor does it appear to be relevant, in this case, because
B) I apologize for being unclear before, I was using Firefox, not Tor Browser, and
C) Found the source of the script in question, turns out, it's added by an addon I had downloaded. Location Guard, available here:
And source : I posted this to the tor-talk after someone on ZeroNet recommended I do so.
D) I cannot get this script to reproduce in Tor Browser, using either the Location Guard addon or any of the myriad JS injector addons available from the Firefox repo. Attempting to do so resulted in zero JS on the page.
This sequence of events got me thinking; the exit node queries servers on the behalf of the Tor Browser. Some sites simply cannot be connected to via HTTPS. Thus, the exit node must query the site requested in HTTP, which can be modified in transit. If done, what form of protections could a MitM do between the site and the exit node bypass by, say, inserting a CSS document that references an external JS script to force a query from the browser?
Again, apologies for being insufficiently clear, I was slightly panicking and thought it should be made known, just in case.

Even if he does, a well-entrenched botnet is a prize unto itself. I
wouldn't put it past the govts of the world to try and hijack it for their
own purposes.
