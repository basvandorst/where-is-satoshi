A directory cache is a relay with DirPort set to something else than 0.
(Not mentioning DirPort is the same as setting it to 0.)
My figures again, with more info (and slightly corrected):

4% TLS write overhead (exit     relay dircache non-client) nickname DFRI3

Leaving privoxy aside, it seems like you are trying to make your tor
client listen to the IPv6 localhost address. This is not necessary in
order to access an IPv6 resource on the internet.
I would recommend using the Tor Browser instead.
Leaving privoxy aside, you will have to add the 'IPv6Traffic' flag to
your SocksPort line in torrc in order for your tor client to ask exits
for IPv6 addresses. Note that you will have to talk SOCKS5 to your tor
client in order for this to work. Here is an example of how to do that:
  $ curl -v -A '' -x socks5://127.0.0.1:9050 You might want the 'PreferIPv6' flag too. See the fine manual.

That's one thing, and it happens now and again. In my case, two of the
nine relays I'm part of operating were missing one fingerprint in their
MyFamily setting. That's been fixed now. This is not the whole story
though I'm afraid.
Five of the relays I'm operating are run by DFRI, where I'm a
sysadmin. Other DFRI sysadmins run other relays. Our solution to that
has so far been to list all the relays that _any_ of us run in MyFamily
for DFRI relays while keeping other sysadmins private relays out of the
config of our private relays. Hmm, example:
  person1 runs relays a,b
  person2 runs relay c
  organisation runs relays d,e,f
a and b list a,b,d,e,f as MyFamily
c lists c,d,e,f as MyFamily
d,e,f list a,b,c,d,e,f as MyFamily
This is probably not going to work as intended with how MyFamily
works. I guess we should call a-f a big happy family and be done with
Then again, MyFamily is on its way out I hear. Is that true and when
does it disappear?

You're right. nodelist_add_node_and_family() considers two relays to be
in the same family when they both claim that the other relay is in their
family, regardless of what the set of relays in the two MyFamily
settings look like.
In this particular case, DFRI's relays do have distinct contact info.
If you do take this into account, I don't understand why a line like the
followin would appear in your list. But maybe you didn't for this list?

For reference, [1] is another hopefully useful resource even if it's a

[1] This configuration is only useful when applied on a client.
Not many clients connect over IPv6 yet. Relays never do, yet.
I don't know if 'arm' knows about IPv6.
There's no support for DirPort's on IPv6.
Seems correct.
Your IPv6 address should show up in Atlas [2], under "OR
Addresses". Does it?
[2] Thanks for running a relay on IPv6!
