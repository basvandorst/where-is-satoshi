@_subject: [tor-talk] Correct way to upgrade Tor in Linux 
The following is not recommended, too easy to make mistakes and cause
security problems, but it is possible to copy the "Data" directory
over the top of new browser install, or copy unzipped browser files
over old install, but then you have to update some about:cache
option(s?) so that tor button knows you're in a new browser. I tried
it once and it's much too complicated for sanity's sake.
Apparently TorBrowser 3.6 series (when stable) will provide
upgrade-in-place option.
Whonix or Tails in an encrypted container might be a better approach
for preservation of stuff...

What is the churn-rate of nodes entering and exiting the network?
(This would need to be a rate as compared to total count.)
I'm wondering whether a git-like protocol might make sense,
where, in the context of one or more trusted centralised Directories,
these Directories could simply perform "signature verification" for
something like a "signed git tag", providing a "signed verification"
of the directory at specific points in time (say, each hour).
And then the bulk of directory data could 'simply' be P2P spread.
Sorry if this doesn't make sense - I have not read the papers you

Juan's voice is an important voice, as he is hard-core "BE CAREFUL",
and this is a very good thing for anyone who might genuinely -need-
privacy in their communications, against USA Corp.
In particular, a healthy (very healthy :)  paranoia enema is important
for some people. And if a newcomer comes to this list genuinely
needing privacy, and everyone speaks "TOR is, OMG, like soooo awesome,
it's just the greatest privacy for everyone", then that newcomer is
likely to guarantee themselves a serious problem.
So caution, paranoia, attention to detail, proper assessment of the
risks and technical foundations/ requirements/ possibilities of what
TOR can, and more importantly cannot provide, is (in such
circumstances) of utmost importance.
On the other hand, for those on this list for some time, the old
refrain becomes, well, an old refrain.
If I personally were in a position to need some level of privacy in my
online communications, I would be -very- grateful for Juan's voice of
caution, no matter that I might disagree with some (or even many/most)
of his points in particular.
His message of caution is so much more the important thing here, in my
so very high opinion :)

"Educating new users" must not be allowed to be seen the same as
"hurting tor", I'm sure Juan would agree here.
"Hurting tor" might not be the best term, but perhaps we can say
'scare-mongering' may cause potential users to run away, thereby
reducing our community, and that this is undesirable; I'd hope Juan
would agree with this.
But I have to agree that whenever we see "omg tor is so ponies and
freedom", that Juan's voice of "whoah, slow the fuck down guys, Tor
and TBB cannot save you from nation-state monitoring, and make sure
you're aware of potential problems a b and c" is much better than no
genuine voice of caution.
And I have to say - every newcomer that appears here, must be the
beneficiary of our best efforts in communication, for we simply cannot
know if -this-particular- newbie is in need of the most careful advice
to be cautious or not.
So -because- Tor is the currently most viable "privacy of some level/
some sort" newtwork today, we particularly owe it to be diligent and
-never- fail to impress upon newcomers what they may need to keep in
their minds.
Mirimir, your words in this email might make a good start for a "Quick
educational caution" which newcomers ought be pointed to, say on the
tp.o wiki.
To help those who need it stay as safe as might be needed and/ or
possible, certainly requires helping them, as early as possible,
framing a mindset and certain understandings. Perhaps we can do better
on this front.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Exit Operator convicted in Austrian lower court 
(Thread start:
Agreed, great news.
In hindsight, it is clear that we as a community have an interest to
build a resource of amicus curiae briefs - friend of the court briefs.
So PLEASE make moves in the direction of contributing and collecting
documents which may be relevant to future cases - at the least a
simple collection of legal docs.
We have an interest in protecting our free-speech networks (Tor, I2P
etc), legally as well as technologically and politically. The
Torproject.org website does a good job IMHO of presenting the social
case for free-speech networks.
No matter the circumstances of a particular case (a particular free
speech node operator), we the global free-speech promoting and
free-speech facilitating community, have an interest to advise the
courts regarding matters of technology and free speech, in order to
maximise the sanity of the outcomes brought about by our courts (and
yes, another operators courts are as good as mine, in terms of global
impact). For example a tor-network node operator charged for actual
illegal activity, should not cause legal suppression of free-speech
networks in general.
To kick things off, here's the gist of what I have in mind (this is in
no way directly responsive to the case that started this thread, which
I know nothing about):
In this matter an individual has been charged with a [criminal] offence.
The case of a matter of an individual committing a proven criminal
defamation or incitement must not be used by the court to suppress
free speech generally by way of the court's power of judicial
Similarly in this case the [Defendant] was the operator of a 'digital
communications facility' which facility was a node in a free-speech
network, in particular the [Tor|I2P} free speech network;
where the operator is found by this court to have committed unlawful
acts, then this court must only  target those unlawful acts when it
makes its determinations, by way of this court's power of judicial
sanction exercised according to law;
and this court must not reach beyond those unlawful acts in its
determinations/ rulings/ sanctions;
if the court exercises its power in reaching beyond those unlawful
acts then such exercise of judicial power is likely to undermine
confidence in the court by all other operators of the free-speech
network and by users of the free speech network.
A ruling by this court will be seen by many humans around the world,
both operators of free speech nodes in the free speech networks, as
well as by users and by potential users of free speech networks around
the world.
In this case, the rulings of this court are visible globally, and
shall be watched by many;
there is therefore a great burden upon this court in this case, and
this court therefore has a special duty of care when it makes its
rulings/ determinations, to be conservative and cautious, in
particular regarding any general deterrents this court might
ordinarily be minded to create by its rulings which deterrents might
unintentionally dampen confidence in this court and/ or confidence in
the courts generally to protect our human rights including freedom of
This court must be especially careful in its rulings in this matter,
since the court is in a position to bring about chilling effects upon
the liberties of not only those humans within its immediate
jurisdictions, but also upon the broader global community.
(A glosary, localisation, much enhancement and other legal polishing
would be required of course, along with subroutined/ separate
submissions regarding each relevant law, and regarding each relevant
precedent in the jurisdiction in question and/ or in jurisdictions
relevant (some cases/precedents are so poignant, so timeless, that
they apply all over the world, e.g. the Credit River Decision, as well
as the trial of William Penn).)
Such advice or briefs to the court are ideally tailored to each
particular country/jurisdiction.
However, even a brief prepared for some country other than the country
at issue, is likely to be useful to those attempting to create a brief
for a particular case in another country, and may even be directly
useful as a filing in its own right, at least if the language is the
same :)
Regarding the filing of briefs, we need standing to file; that is, we
need an interest in the matter which interest is seen by the court.
In some countries particular organisations may be ideal for the filing
of such briefs, such as the FSF and EFF (USA) and EFA (Australia).
In other countries, if there is no directly applicable organisation,
then a "designated representative of the Torproject" who is resident
in that country, may have standing to make such a filing.
Alternatively, a local human-rights-friendly politician may be
amenable to making the filing on behalf of their constituent(s)
(that's us).
Finally, in general any individual should have standing to make such a
filing, since we have an interest in our own human rights - free
speech is a fundamental human right - so we should also aim for the
preparation and collection of briefs file-able by ourselves.
Take notice, we HAVE A DUTY OF CARE to each other, and to the broader
community, to contact Torproject and/ or others in this community, if
ever we find ourselves in a court case involving the operation of any
free speech network node (I2P, Tor, exit or relay), in order that
those in the community who have an interest, ie the rest of us (at
least those of us in the same country), are given the opportunity to
make our interest known to the respective court(s) in that
jurisdiction, by way of filing appropriate and standardized briefs.

I'm not sure the TorExitGuidelines provide an adequate
Behaviour FAQ, in the hindsight of recent events.
Here's a draft of some extra FAQs, please jump on in everyone and
- Node operators (relays, entries and exits) are advised to be
especially careful with their exercise of their right to free speech
in all public forums. A healthy paranoia is recommended in such public
- Consider that everything you say in public (and everything on the
internet is public) will most likely be held against you in a court of
law, should you (in the extreme case) find yourself as a Defendant in
a court case where your activities are related to Tor.
Perhaps some one would write up Williams case (with links) for
submission to torproject. Of course having the court's actual ruling
is a pre-requisite.
A collection of pointers to cases/ events (those that have any public
records) would be a good start, regardless of primary language
(translation is merely one step in the collection, sorting and
presentation phases).
Agreed. Thus the almighty disclaimer - as long as you don't step on
the potential profits of (those particular few unethical) lawyers,
then we ought be able to say what we like, and help each other.
The flip side of "lay person giving legal advice" or variations
thereof, is that a "(potential) consumer of legal services", if they
are not properly informed and disclaimed etc, may pursue a path of
action which causes them harm of some sort, when it was/may have been
in their interests to "seek legal advice".
So again, we have a duty of care to each other, and to those who read
the material we publish. Things can go off the rails if/when we are
not careful in considering unforeseen consequences into the future.
Unfortunately "caveat human" is no longer - humans are expected to be
baby sat and treated with provision of a cotton wool society, and
anyone who goes against that is treated ("quasi") criminally (I have
personal experience of this in Australia).
Don't get me wrong: disclaimers and appropriate cautions are good things.
But so the firetruck is self responsibility and common sense; as these
are removed, we have survival of the stupidest.
Sorry, I'm ranting now...
Thank you. That is a very useful thing to say.
The torproject.org site, in the light of this, _ought_ provide some FAQs:
- How to publicize your court case if you need or want assistance.
Guys, let's jump in and formulate appropriate FAQs - paraphrasing
Moritz's words above in a FAQ- and family- friendly and functional
Again, what's a suitable FAQ entry.
We want to mitigate future versions of such events,
in the hindsight of these experiences.
- If you do not want the assistance of torproject.org,
please assist the community by contacting torproject.org
and letting them know that you have your case in hand,
either with lawyers or by yourself, so that the community
knows in advance that you have chosen a pathway for handling
your case.
- If you are able to, please pre-empt negative public discussion
about the free speech networks if and when you blog or otherwise
communicate about your case, whether or not you are receiving
any assistance from torproject.
Of course. Thanks. I agree that there has been what reads as a bit
of negativity about torproject. We ought assume good faith (with
suitable cautiousness and paranoia etc etc).
Is it ok to prompt and suggest and debate potential FAQ/site
enhancements here on tor-talk?

Sure. Just as well I did not start editing my ideas straight into the
wiki then eh?
Sure, that's a good sentence to add. Some things, when written/read
appear as self evident common sense (to some of us), yet it is evident
that some such things are not self evident and are not "just common
sense" to some people. At least not until they read them :)
Agreed. The state of (lack of) self-responsibility within our laws is
a blight upon the human race. Nearly every mug who could "get out of"
a (most often unjust) parking fine or speeding fine or jaywalking or
public incitement or _ _ _ charge, by blaming someone else (the
government, the police, the courts etc), has done so, and so has
contributed to the degeneration of our laws with respect to self
responsibility, of conscience, of inner authority etc... Of course
those unjust laws themselves are also direct contributors to the
ongoing degeneration. We more and more become subservient to the
external authority of an 'almighty' "statute law".
Sad indeed.

It is _so_ easy to give advice that could get you in trouble. You
really need to provide more parameters, eg:
- what is the sensitivity of the site?
- is it a leak - worthy of going to wikileaks.org?
- is the content illegal in any jurisdiction(s)?
- you say "a provider" - have you decided on a provider?

Target package prepared by the National Security Agency prior to the
capture of Abu Hamza in January 2011
By Barton Gellman, Julie Tate and Ashkan Soltani July 5 at 8:46 PM
Follow  Follow Ordinary Internet users, American and non-American alike, far
outnumber legally targeted foreigners in the communications
intercepted by the National Security Agency from U.S. digital
networks, according to a four-month investigation by The Washington
Nine of 10 account holders found in a large cache of intercepted
conversations, which former NSA contractor Edward Snowden provided in
full to The Post, were not the intended surveillance targets but were
caught in a net the agency had cast for somebody else.
Many of them were Americans. Nearly half of the surveillance files, a
strikingly high proportion, contained names, e-mail addresses or other
details that the NSA marked as belonging to U.S. citizens or
residents. NSA analysts masked, or ?minimized,? more than 65,000 such
references to protect Americans? privacy, but The Post found nearly
900 additional e-mail addresses, unmasked in the files, that could be
strongly linked to U.S. citizens or U.S.residents.
The surveillance files highlight a policy dilemma that has been aired
only abstractly in public. There are discoveries of considerable
intelligence value in the intercepted messages ? and collateral harm
to privacy on a scale that the Obama administration has not been
willing to address.
Among the most valuable contents ? which The Post will not describe in
detail, to avoid interfering with ongoing operations ? are fresh
revelations about a secret overseas nuclear project, double-dealing by
an ostensible ally, a military calamity that befell an unfriendly
power, and the identities of aggressive intruders into U.S. computer
A breakdown of the cache of NSA-intercepted communications provided to
the Washington Post by Edward Snowden
Months of tracking communications across more than 50 alias accounts,
the files show, led directly to the 2011 capture in Abbottabad of
Muhammad Tahir Shahzad, a Pakistan-based bomb builder, and Umar Patek,
a suspect in a 2002 terrorist bombing on the Indonesian island of
Bali. At the request of CIA officials, The Post is withholding other
examples that officials said would compromise ongoing operations.
Many other files, described as useless by the analysts but nonetheless
retained, have a startlingly intimate, even voyeuristic quality. They
tell stories of love and heartbreak, illicit sexual liaisons,
mental-health crises, political and religious conversions, financial
anxieties and disappointed hopes. The daily lives of more than 10,000
account holders who were not targeted are catalogued and recorded
In order to allow time for analysis and outside reporting, neither
Snowden nor The Post has disclosed until now that he obtained and
shared the content of intercepted communications. The cache Snowden
provided came from domestic NSA operations under the broad authority
granted by Congress in 2008 with amendments to the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act. FISA content is generally stored in
closely controlled data repositories, and for more than a year, senior
government officials have depicted it as beyond Snowden?s reach.
The Post reviewed roughly 160,000 intercepted e-mail and
instant-message conversations, some of them hundreds of pages long,
and 7,900 documents taken from more than 11,000 online accounts.
The material spans President Obama?s first term, from 2009 to 2012, a
period of exponential growth for the NSA?s domestic collection.
Taken together, the files offer an unprecedented vantage point on the
changes wrought by Section 702 of the FISA amendments, which enabled
the NSA to make freer use of methods that for 30 years had required
probable cause and a warrant from a judge. One program, code-named
PRISM, extracts content stored in user accounts at Yahoo, Microsoft,
Facebook, Google and five other leading Internet companies. Another,
known inside the NSA as Upstream, intercepts data on the move as it
crosses the U.S. junctions of global voice and data networks.
No government oversight body, including the Justice Department, the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, intelligence committees in
Congress or the president?s Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight
Board, has delved into a comparably large sample of what the NSA
actually collects ? not only from its targets but also from people who
may cross a target?s path.
A composite image of two of the more than 5,000 private photos among
data collected by the National Security Agency from online accounts
and network links in the United States. The images were included in a
large cache of NSA intercepts provided by former agency contractor
Edward Snowden. (Images obtained by The Washington Post)
Among the latter are medical records sent from one family member to
another, r?sum?s from job hunters and academic transcripts of
schoolchildren. In one photo, a young girl in religious dress beams at
a camera outside a mosque.
Scores of pictures show infants and toddlers in bathtubs, on swings,
sprawled on their backs and kissed by their mothers. In some photos,
men show off their physiques. In others, women model lingerie, leaning
suggestively into a webcam or striking risque poses in shorts and
bikini tops.
?None of the hits that were received were relevant,? two Navy
cryptologic technicians write in one of many summaries of
nonproductive surveillance. ?No additional information,? writes a
civilian analyst. Another makes fun of a suspected kidnapper, newly
arrived in Syria before the current civil war, who begs for employment
as a janitor and makes wide-eyed observations about the state of
undress displayed by women on local beaches.
By law, the NSA may ?target? only foreign nationals located overseas
unless it obtains a warrant based on probable cause from a special
surveillance court. For collection under PRISM and Upstream rules,
analysts must state a reasonable belief that the target has
information of value about a foreign government, a terrorist
organization or the spread of nonconventional weapons.
Most of the people caught up in those programs are not the targets and
would not lawfully qualify as such. ?Incidental collection? of
third-party communications is inevitable in many forms of
surveillance, but in other contexts the U.S. government works harder
to limit and discard irrelevant data. In criminal wiretaps, for
example, the FBI is supposed to stop listening to a call if a
suspect?s wife or child is using the phone.
There are many ways to be swept up incidentally in surveillance aimed
at a valid foreign target. Some of those in the Snowden archive were
monitored because they interacted directly with a target, but others
had more-tenuous links.
If a target entered an online chat room, the NSA collected the words
and identities of every person who posted there, regardless of
subject, as well as every person who simply ?lurked,? reading
passively what other people wrote.
?1 target, 38 others on there,? one analyst wrote. She collected data
on them all.
In other cases, the NSA designated as its target the Internet
protocol, or IP, address of a computer server used by hundreds of
The NSA treats all content intercepted incidentally from third parties
as permissible to retain, store, search and distribute to its
government customers. Raj De, the agency?s general counsel, has
testified that the NSA does not generally attempt to remove irrelevant
personal content, because it is difficult for one analyst to know what
might become relevant to another.
The Obama administration declines to discuss the scale of incidental
collection. The NSA, backed by Director of National Intelligence James
R. Clapper Jr., has asserted that it is unable to make any estimate,
even in classified form, of the number of Americans swept in. It is
not obvious why the NSA could not offer at least a partial count,
given that its analysts routinely pick out ?U.S. persons? and mask
their identities, in most cases, before distributing intelligence
If Snowden?s sample is representative, the population under scrutiny
in the PRISM and Upstream programs is far larger than the government
has suggested. In a June 26 ?transparency report,? the Office of the
Director of National Intelligence disclosed that 89,138 people were
targets of last year?s collection under FISA Section 702. At the
9-to-1 ratio of incidental collection in Snowden?s sample, the
office?s figure would correspond to nearly 900,000 accounts, targeted
or not, under surveillance.
?He didn?t get this data?
U.S. intelligence officials declined to confirm or deny in general
terms the authenticity of the intercepted content provided by Snowden,
but they made off-the-record requests to withhold specific details
that they said would alert the targets of ongoing surveillance. Some
officials, who declined to be quoted by name, described Snowden?s
handling of the sensitive files as reckless.
In an interview, Snowden said ?primary documents? offered the only
path to a concrete debate about the costs and benefits of Section 702
surveillance. He did not favor public release of the full archive, he
said, but he did not think a reporter could understand the programs
?without being able to review some of that surveillance, both the
justified and unjustified.?
?While people may disagree about where to draw the line on
publication, I know that you and The Post have enough sense of civic
duty to consult with the government to ensure that the reporting on
and handling of this material causes no harm,? he said.
In Snowden?s view, the PRISM and Upstream programs have ?crossed the
line of proportionality.?
?Even if one could conceivably justify the initial, inadvertent
interception of baby pictures and love letters of innocent
bystanders,? he added, ?their continued storage in government
databases is both troubling and dangerous. Who knows how that
information will be used in the future??
For close to a year, NSA and other government officials have appeared
to deny, in congressional testimony and public statements, that
Snowden had any access to the material.
As recently as May, shortly after he retired as NSA director, Gen.
Keith Alexander denied that Snowden could have passed FISA content to
?He didn?t get this data,? Alexander told a New Yorker reporter. ?They
didn?t touch ??
?The operational data?? the reporter asked.
?They didn?t touch the FISA data,? Alexander replied. He added, ?That
database, he didn?t have access to.?
Robert S. Litt, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence, said in a prepared statement that Alexander and
other officials were speaking only about ?raw? intelligence, the term
for intercepted content that has not yet been evaluated, stamped with
classification markings or minimized to mask U.S. identities.
?We have talked about the very strict controls on raw traffic, the
training that people have to have, the technological lockdowns on
access,? Litt said. ?Nothing that you have given us indicates that
Snowden was able to circumvent that in any way.?
In the interview, Snowden said he did not need to circumvent those
controls, because his final position as a contractor for Booz Allen at
the NSA?s Hawaii operations center gave him ?unusually broad,
unescorted access to raw SIGINT [signals intelligence] under a special
?Dual Authorities? role,? a reference to Section 702 for domestic
collection and Executive Order 12333 for collection overseas. Those
credentials, he said, allowed him to search stored content ? and
?task? new collection ? without prior approval of his search terms.
?If I had wanted to pull a copy of a judge?s or a senator?s e-mail,
all I had to do was enter that selector into XKEYSCORE,? one of the
NSA?s main query systems, he said.
The NSA has released an e-mail exchange acknowledging that Snowden
took the required training classes for access to those systems.
?Minimized U.S. president?
At one level, the NSA shows scrupulous care in protecting the privacy
of U.S. nationals and, by policy, those of its four closest
intelligence allies ? Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
More than 1,000 distinct ?minimization? terms appear in the files,
attempting to mask the identities of ?possible,? ?potential? and
?probable? U.S. persons, along with the names of U.S. beverage
companies, universities, fast-food chains and Web-mail hosts.
Some of them border on the absurd, using titles that could apply to
only one man. A ?minimized U.S. president-elect? begins to appear in
the files in early 2009, and references to the current ?minimized U.S.
president? appear 1,227 times in the following four years.
Even so, unmasked identities remain in the NSA?s files, and the
agency?s policy is to hold on to ?incidentally? collected U.S.
content, even if it does not appear to contain foreign intelligence.
In one exchange captured in the files, a young American asks a
Pakistani friend in late 2009 what he thinks of the war in
Afghanistan. The Pakistani replies that it is a religious struggle
against 44 enemy states.
Startled, the American says ?they, ah, they arent heavily

When NSA and allied analysts really want to target an account, their
concern for U.S. privacy diminishes. The rationales they use to judge
foreignness sometimes stretch legal rules or well-known technical
facts to the breaking point.
In their classified internal communications, colleagues and
supervisors often remind the analysts that PRISM and Upstream
collection have a ?lower threshold for foreignness ?standard of proof?
? than a traditional surveillance warrant from a FISA judge, requiring
only a ?reasonable belief? and not probable cause.
One analyst rests her claim that a target is foreign on the fact that
his e-mails are written in a foreign language, a quality shared by
tens of millions of Americans. Others are allowed to presume that
anyone on the chat ?buddy list? of a known foreign national is also
In many other cases, analysts seek and obtain approval to treat an
account as ?foreign? if someone connects to it from a computer address
that seems to be overseas. ?The best foreignness explanations have the
selector being accessed via a foreign IP address,? an NSA supervisor
instructs an allied analyst in Australia.
Apart from the fact that tens of millions of Americans live and travel
overseas, additional millions use simple tools called proxies to
redirect their data traffic around the world, for business or
pleasure. World Cup fans this month have been using a browser
extension called Hola to watch live-streamed games that are
unavailable from their own countries. The same trick is routinely used
by Americans who want to watch BBC video. The NSA also relies
routinely on locations embedded in Yahoo tracking cookies, which are
widely regarded by online advertisers as unreliable.
In an ordinary FISA surveillance application, the judge grants a
warrant and requires a fresh review of probable cause ? and the
content of collected surveillance ? every 90 days. When renewal fails,
NSA and allied analysts sometimes switch to the more lenient standards
of PRISM and Upstream.
?These selectors were previously under FISA warrant but the warrants
have expired,? one analyst writes, requesting that surveillance resume
under the looser standards of Section 702. The request was granted.
?I don?t like people knowing?
She was 29 and shattered by divorce, converting to Islam in search of
comfort and love. He was three years younger, rugged and restless. His
parents had fled Kabul and raised him in Australia, but he dreamed of
returning to Afghanistan.
One day when she was sick in bed, he brought her tea. Their faith
forbade what happened next, and later she recalled it with shame.
?what we did was evil and cursed and may allah swt MOST merciful
forgive us for giving in to our nafs [desires]?
Still, a romance grew. They fought. They spoke of marriage. They fought again.
All of this was in the files because, around the same time, he went
looking for the Taliban.
He found an e-mail address on its English-language Web site and wrote
repeatedly, professing loyalty to the one true faith, offering to
?come help my brothers? and join the fight against the unbelievers.
On May 30, 2012, without a word to her, he boarded a plane to begin a
journey to Kandahar. He left word that he would not see her again.
If that had been the end of it, there would not be more than 800 pages
of anguished correspondence between them in the archives of the NSA
and its counterpart, the Australian Signals Directorate.
He had made himself a target. She was the collateral damage, placed
under a microscope as she tried to adjust to the loss.
Three weeks after he landed in Kandahar, she found him on Facebook.
?Im putting all my pride aside just to say that i will miss you dearly
and your the only person that i really allowed myself to get close to
after losing my ex husband, my dad and my brother.. Im glad it was so
easy for you to move on and put what we had aside and for me well Im
just soo happy i met you. You will always remain in my heart. I know
you left for a purpose it hurts like hell sometimes not because Im
needy but because i wish i could have been with you.?
His replies were cool, then insulting, and gradually became demanding.
He would marry her but there were conditions. She must submit to his
will, move in with his parents and wait for him in Australia. She must
hand him control of her Facebook account ? he did not approve of the
photos posted there.
She refused. He insisted:
?look in islam husband doesnt touch girl financial earnigs unless she
agrees but as far as privacy goes there is no room?.i need to have all
ur details everything u do its what im supposed to know that will
guide u whether its right or wrong got it?
Later, she came to understand the irony of her reply:
?I don?t like people knowing my private life.?
Months of negotiations followed, with each of them declaring an end to
the romance a dozen times or more. He claimed he had found someone
else and planned to marry that day, then admitted it was a lie. She
?No more games. You come home. You won?t last with an afghan girl.?
She begged him to give up his dangerous path. Finally, in September,
she broke off contact for good, informing him that she was engaged to
another man.
?When you come back they will send you to jail,? she warned.
They almost did.
In interviews with The Post, conducted by telephone and Facebook, she
said he flew home to Australia last summer, after failing to find
members of the Taliban who would take him seriously. Australian
National Police met him at the airport and questioned him in custody.
They questioned her, too, politely, in her home. They showed her
transcripts of their failed romance. When a Post reporter called, she
already knew what the two governments had collected about her.
Eventually, she said, Australian authorities decided not to charge her
failed suitor with a crime. Police spokeswoman Emilie Lovatt declined
to comment on the case.
Looking back, the young woman said she understands why her intimate
correspondence was recorded and parsed by men and women she did not
?Do I feel violated?? she asked. ?Yes. I?m not against the fact that
my privacy was violated in this instance, because he was stupid. He
wasn?t thinking straight. I don?t agree with what he was doing.?
What she does not understand, she said, is why after all this time,
with the case long closed and her own job with the Australian
government secure, the NSA does not discard what it no longer needs.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Exit Operator convicted in Austrian lower court 
I think this is a valid point in any jurisdiction, and also speaks to
the difficulty in having a lower court sanction itself - thus superior
Yes, pretty sad.
Although our High Court (equiv. to US Supreme Court) has ruled that we
have a "freedom of communication on political and related matters"
'implied within our constitution' (although it is not explicit).
So some communication (political matters) has been ruled as an implied
freedom. This is the freedom that a lot of our political protest (if
not all) falls under. See for example the case of Levy:
Levy is long sorry - the gist is a duck-hunting protester who
trespassed as part of his protest - it was upheld by our High Court
that he was exercising his implied right to freedom of communciation
on political matters.
See also:
The reasoning of our superior court that we have this implied freedom,
is that our constitution embodies/ proscribes a system of democratic
government, and that this necessarily implies a right of the people to
discuss political and related matters. Sounds pretty straightforward.
So we are also assuming that our superior court would be likely to
similarly rule on the existence of an "implied freedom of
communication on legal and related matters" - the courts are
established by our constitution, the process of legal service, we have
the right to present for ourselves in court, etc, etc, so this "legal
system proscribed by our constitution necessarily implies an implied
freedom to communicate on legal and related matters". This is a
question we are bringing to our High Court.
Interestingly, earlier this year, we brought (for the first time)
before the Magistrate's Court, our lowest court, the following
question: "Is there within our (federal) constitution an implied right
to freedom of communication on legal and related matters?"
We said this was a question which must be brought before our superior
court for determination, and incredibly, the Magistrate not only ruled
that she was "not persuaded that" there was any constitutional
question raised, but she also ruled on the constitutional question
itself, ruling "there is no freedom of communication on legal matters
within our constitution, either implied or explicit".
Some of us were gobsmacked.
Anyway, we have the right to lift the matter to our superior courts,
and lift it we shall.
Stay tuned :)

Excessive popularity/ usage, without measures to 'encourage' or

@_subject: [tor-talk] Putting the "Tor" back in Torrent 
Sounds great to me. Thank you for laying out the thought this clearly.
One OA per:
- client/peer? or
- per torrent? or
- per shard/ sharing block?
It may behoove us to consider privacy implications, and may
be simple to maximise privacy/ frustrate correleation attacks.
The client is operating to some degree as a "sharding" cache
The copyright cartel consider that an illegal thing to do.
It is in our interests to maximise privacy.
Plausible deniability may be increased with:
* Another concept: opportunistic shard caching,
dependent on network demand;
Tor has some infrastructure/ protocol stuff in regards
to this (HSDir nodes).
This client is a Tor relay "serving" anon hidden services
(specifically torrent peers).
Given bandwidth constraints and sharing defaults etc,
this client could _opportunisticly_ cache excessively
popular shards, to provide:
- plausible deniability
- network capacity increases
Infrastructure requirements:
Increases in clients must result in corresponding
increase of "network infrastructure capacity", including:
- network throughput - each client defaults to a relay
- dht capacity - each client participates in torrent dht
- hidden service directory/ lookup capacity - each client
operating immediately as a HSDir, at least for these Torrents;
this might require a separate HSDir namespace for torrents
(please speak with Tor gurus on this one sorry not me),
hopefully not, but who knows - Tor network currently has some
centralised components which must be considered since we are
talking potentially orders of magnitude increase in clients.
- other network scaling pain points to consider ??
In the past I thought that if a particular torrent client
(I am only familiar with the Java-based Vuze/azureus)
provides the ability for plugins to replace all core features
(dht lookups, network access, storage etc),
then all those parts of the puzzle could be more easily
replaced one by one, the modular design (of Vuze say) making
the development of a proper Tor/torrent thing more easy.
All connections must always be to hidden services only.
AIUI, Tor also has some built in mechanisms at its network layer,
to encourage contributory network behaviour.
I disagree. Strongly.
*Abundance is an engineering problem.*
You heard it here :)
We see the proof of this in the success of Bittorrent software.
When the design is appropriate to the problem,
abundance is built in, and _does_ provide the needed results.
It is important however to consider current technical
"potential limitations" in the current Tor network design -
namely, at least some part is centralised.
The directory/ network concensus stuff needs to be decentralised
(ie more torrent like) for this; design possibility:
torrent-share the directory "blobs" and merely get signature/
certification keys from the centralised "Directory" servers to
verify the current directory concensus "blob" that you got
(and verify that it is "recent" enough etc etc).
If these changes can be shown to reduce network privacy,
then it might be that the goals of a bittorrent_tor client
conflict with the goals of the Tor network.
That is, there might be a fundamental conflict between
privacy and _instantaneous_ network joining.
I don't know sorry.
The goal is very laudable.
Yes which is why all such parts of the network need to be fully
decentralised - able to be provided by each tor_torrent client.
No. And yes. The point is, *with the right design*, capacity
will take care of itself.
That implies there may well be a little bit of work to do
on the Tor network layer.
Of course, this tor_torrent client might just be the driver
to speed that process.
Doesn't sound complicated to me, but I am not a Tor developer.
Go for it. I believe it will take our most popular free
speech network (tor) to the next level, and quite possibly
close to the ideal position for free speech networks in
general - ubiquity.

There was Groklaw, but that is no more.
I have presumed in the past that certain "groundwork" work might be
useful for those involved in cases.
However, pre-emptive action is difficult due to the number of
jurisdictions. Groklaw built on the SCO case, which was a) widely
reported, b) struck at the heart of the free/libre software world, c)
involved big budged companies, d) continued for a very long time.
A very valuable literary-legal resource was created by that effort
(other cases were covered to some degrees).
I would discourage self-represented defence in cases surrounding
Tor/I2P etc, due to the potential significance of adverse consequences
to the broader *globabl* free-speech network communities!
Self-represented may be ok in conjunction with support from
pro-liberty lawyers. This might be quite jurisdiction-sensitive, I
don't know.
But first and foremost, we have a duty of care to each other in this
freedom-speech community, to not hide such cases from those who would
be able to support, due to the potential community chilling effects.
SO, such a list might be a very useful thing to set up, so that those
who might "valantly" charge ahead in a case self-representing, might
receive the support and the cautions from supportive lawyers regarding
all possible approaches, etc, etc.

OK. Wide applicability is good.
That sounds like that's  what you/your client is selling, but you
ought be clear on what the guarantees of tor are (what it's threat
model is, and what it provides **1),
But more importantly, the question was what is the *use* *case* - as
in, how are these devices or software 'nodes' going to interact with
the Tor network?
To be precise, the question was broken down:
Will these 'nodes' use the Tor network (like TBB)?
Will these 'nodes' contribute to the Tor network?
If they contribute, do they contribute in configurable way, or fixed way?
In either case, it what ways - as relays, exits, what?
Are you aware of who else will most likely face those challenges?
Sounds like yes, you have some idea - this is good :)
So do you have plans to handle that implosion?
If it's too super secret, ok.
I am no Tor expert, but source-location anonymity is about as much as
you will get from Tor, as far as I understand it; that is, privacy is
dependent on end-user education, as well as the end user using tools
which do not leak personal information, almost a tall ask, but TBB
basically provides that, iff you disable javascript. It is good to
promote freedom of speech through forms of anonymity, but please don't
sell Tor as being something it is not.
I hope you succeed in expanding public awareness and effective (non
melt down) use of free speech networks in particular Tor.

May be so, but I remember reading an NSA slide from Snowden's leaks
showing their intent to break TOR, and some problems they faced in
doing so.
So Tor provides (of necessity I guess, to work to break the great
firewall etc) some level of genuine facility - it is a useful tool for
"dissidents" as much as for grouping dissidents into "use of one

Juan, it's all very well for you to jump in now,
but you are neglecting the OP - as in, the Original
Post(er) - for reference, here it is in all its factual
support and unambiguous and simple assertions
(my comments are from me, I am not a mathematician,
statistician nor Tor programmer):
Statement 1: speaks to an anecdotal, one man,
personal "study"; no facts; no references.
Assertion 2: anecdotal, "tend to be"; no facts;
no references.
Assertion 3: assumption or anecdote, "has been noted",
"across the board"; no facts; no references.
Conclusion 4: conclusion based on personal anecdote;
no facts; no references.
Assertion 5: anecdote, no sites, no research presented;
no facts; no references.
Statement 6: I call this emotionally-laced hand-waving;
no facts; no references.
Conclusion 7: generic conclusion asserting possible ill intention
on part of Tor devs - I call this "fishing by (implied) accusation",
aka "hoping or assuming that [I] might flush out something
devious by making (possibly personal) accusations";
no facts; no references.
And now McCarron calls for meaningful help/ insights/ responses?
Juan, _and_ McCarron, you MUST be kidding me!
So don't get me wrong Juan, I'd love to know whether or not all these
assertions, assumptions and anecdotes by McCarron are either true or
false, or at least founded in some facts arising from something,
anything that I could personally verify or test.
This is NOT the case here by McCarron! McCarron has provided NOTHING
in this regard.
McCarron continued in like fashion throughout this thread.
Someone such as myself is unable to verify, prove or disprove or
otherwise respond intelligently to ANYTHING McCarron has stated.
Someone such as myself is unable to gain ANY meaningful or testable
data, information, conclusion or otherwise from what McCarron has
Due to this all the above, someone such as myself is therefore unable
to meaningfully contribute to McCarron's "DISCUSSION" because either:
A) there is a bunch of assumed (by McCarron) knowledge which I don't
have, and which McCarron has not provided even references for, or
B) McCarron is doing nothing other than fishing by assertion, aka
"hand-waving with a mission"!
Juan, given the challenges and responses brought to McCarron in this
thread, McCarron has persistently failed to provide ANYTHING
whatsoever that is researchable or verifiable or testable, to someone
such as myself, to be able to in any way relate to or verify what he
is saying in any sort of scientific manner.
Juan, the most McCarron put to us was some self-glorification "I am a
contractor on multi-million dollar government security projects,
listen to me I have wonderful anecdotes to share and I KNOW what I'm
saying is true!" Or could be. Or ...
Juan, in the face of all the above, it is, in my personal estimation,
a pretty fair call, at this point, to name McCarron's behaviour as
troll-like. He may be genuine; he may be sincere; he may have
legitimate points; he may have valid personal "intuition".
BUT, he has provided NOTHING in THIS thread, to someone such as
myself, to be able to evaluate ANYTHING of what HE has said.

you are right.
A bit odd.
I guess it's because a repo can have many branches, and the
description I am thinking of (which we see on the website) really
relates to a branch, which is essentially what each git.torproject

man git-clone : has no option to download "description".
Ah - well then, is there a script or 'standard way' of cloning a whole

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB - Correct/proper use of TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1 ? 
we see addition of
command line option to effect start-tor-browser.
My questions all assume using TBB.
Q1) When is it sensible to use the above TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1 option?
For example:
 - when connecting to local always-on relay?
 - when connecting to local sometimes-on relay?
 - when connecting to ones own 'cloud' relay via VPN?
 - when connecting to ones own physical host relay via VPN?
 - when connecting to a friend's home host relay via VPN?
Q2) When connecting to a trusted friend's relay via VPN, what is the
recommended TBB startup config/procedure - I'm thinking of the first
"connection dialog" questions - eg so far I have recommended to my
friends, when starting TBB:
 -> No (isp not block - assuming that's actually true)
 -> No (do not need proxy - unless really needed)
 -> enter relay nickname - in my case gracemissionstor
Is this sensible?
Is it better to figure out the relay key, and write that down or email
etc that to my friends, in place of my relay nickname?
Q3) Does TBB need Tor Control port 9151 in addition to SOCKS port 9150?
Q3b) (similar question) When running through a VPN to trusted host
running a tor relay, must both Tor SOCKS and Control ports be
forwarded, if intending to use this TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH option?
Q4) When running TBB locally, but connecting through a VPN to a
trusted host running a tor relay, what is the recommended connection
setup/settings, eg so you're not running tor over tor (does this make
sense?) - assuming specifying a particular tor relay to connect to?
Or does TBB figure out the right thing to do here?
Q5) When connecting to a trusted friend's relay via the open Internet,
is this what's called using the relay as a "bridge"?
Sorry about all the questions - I have read a lot of the torproject
website, trac tickets and security and other papers in the last few
weeks, trying to get up to speed, but my head is kind of spinning!
On some of these questions I feel unable to advise those I advocate to
on best practice, or even being able to give them or myself certainty
on what is a proper and secure setup, and a not-horribly-inefficient
setup (eg tor over tor) - there are no visual indications by TBB on
these questions except for the big stark "Something went horribly
wrong" warning which TBB displays on some circumstances!
I don't find that helpful to solving these questions/problems above,
although I do acknowledge that such warning is at least a minimally
useful and an entirely necessary thing.
I find the TBB startup dialog/window to be especially "sparse" in
regards to all my questions above!
That is, TBB does not have most of these situations catered for, nor
named, nor even explained when clicking on the "help" button!
So given my local-guru status and the expectations others place on me,
I'm struggling to feel as though I can give _any_ proper advice at the
moment. Perhaps there is some room for an "advanced" TBB startup
If I have simply missed some obvious point of tor documentation,
please let me know and I will gladly spend more time reading.
Thank you very much in advance,

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB - Correct/proper use of TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1 ? 
My proposed "VPN" scenario is similar to the Whonix concept.
High-latency, low-bandwidth dialup and satellite connections for some
of the people I advocate tor to (and libre software in general of
This FAQ entry:
says in part "if you're looking for a trusted entry into the Tor
network, setting up a private Tor server as a bridge is a great
The "private bridge" or rather, "trusted entry" in our case is the
first (so far) tor relay I installed, which is installed at a site
with a low-latency, reasonable-bandwidth ADSL2 connection.
As the website suggests here:
exit relays are most needed. So that's what I set up.
I am assuming that this exit relay is also useful as a "trusted entry
to tor" bridge for those who are not practically able to run their own
private/public bridge/relay (high latency links etc, see above).
Is my assumption correct?
If not, is there a better way? Eg would it make sense to run two
instances of tor at the current exit relay host (one as a "trusted
entry"), rather than just the exit relay?
So I'm not sure any of those 5 questions above make sense. But that's
the context in my mind "trusted entry to tor" at the least for those
with problematic, high-latency and/ or low-bandwidth and/ or censored
(not sure that's the case yet in Australia, but could be?) internet
I am using the term "VPN" since for my joining-tor advocacy, at least
for a few people, I have set up limited ssh logins on our first exit
relay I refer to, which I am assuming is also a useful tor entry point
for problematic internet links. So it is I guess a "limited" VPN which
I am referring to in my questions, which exists for the purposes of
allowing certain users (with problematic links) to connect to the exit
relay which I am assuming is useful as a "trusted entry bridge".
Hope I'm making sense here...
A question I'm not able to answer: is it beneficial to have this VPN
for some of the users, or should I just tell them "customize your
connection and add the name of the relay to the last step - to bypass
your filtering ISP or to use our 'trusted relay'"?
Or is it better that they use the IP address and tor port of the relay
as their "bridge" config, or something else?
I really would like to understand the pros and cons of these
alternatives, and have been studying tp.o in vain to try and find out.
When you say "running tor locally", are you referring only to a "local
always-on relay" - eg one connected to ADSL permanently? Or do you
also include in that term, 'running TBB locally on the spot which
creates its own local tor instance'? As in, are you also including in
the term "running tor locally" a "local sometimes-on relay (or
'private' bridge?)"?
For example, a person has a high-latency low-bandwidth dialup
connection and so cannot run a relay and cannot run it all the time -
they need to make and receive phone calls sometimes, or they only have
one portable computer which they cannot leave on site at all times.
Does a temporary local "tor" satisfy the concept "running tor
I apologise in advance, I am quite a newbie to tor and anonymous
networks and am really struggling with some of the terms and concepts
used. Yes I may well be missing something obvious.
My next question: Does running a "local always-on relay" provide
by simply running it, but completely ignoring it thereafter (as in,
just run TBB with default network config, pretending your own relay
does not exist)?
I've been assuming not, but after your questions back to me, now I'm
beginning to wonder how confused I might really be here... If it is
not recommended to run a relay and connect with TBB to somewhere else
(whatever the 'default' happens to be), then this should certainly be
stated somewhere - and frankly, TBB ought have options in its config
dialog (it this is what is recommended) for "I'm running a tor relay
on my LAN, which I am also connected to right now, and intend to use
it - here's the SOCKS IP and port" as well as "I'm VPN-ing to a relay
I'm running elsewhere and intend to use that, here's my properly
forwarded localhost SOCKS port for my remote tor relay instance".
If 'run a relay but ignore it' is intended by the project, that is not
intuitive from the torproject.org website and documentation that I've
read so far.
I don't understand the anonymity implications for the differences in
these various scenarios which I am trying to comprehend.
And I haven't been able to answer these questions in a fair bit of
reading so far.
And whilst I don't understand, then I am unable to advocate (in good
conscience) in any way other than to say "yeah, TBB should provide
some reasonable anonymity improvements - just download from tp.o and
run". Without understanding, of course I cannot optimize privacy for
those I advocate to.
High-latency, low-bandwidth, only sometimes-on internet connections.
Also, I am struggling to find a proper definition of 'private bridge'
and what that exactly means and how it actually works.
I searched tp.o for a glossary, and only found git showing a terms
list for translators (no definitions). Perhaps the FAQ could be
updated after my mis-understandings are clarified?
For example, I am currently unable to answer the question: What sort
of connections does a private bridge have in and out?
Is it only connections from those who know the name or ip of the
private bridge? Or does it also act as a relay sometimes? BTW, I have
read this (in full, at least twice, as with much of tp.o):
and yet still cannot answer these questions.
I have yet to properly read the Tor design docs, but I was hoping tp.o
would provide enough information for a thorough understanding for a
(advanced?) relay operator. Perhaps up to now no one has faced the
scenarios I am facing - in which case, this will be a great
opportunity for some new docs. I am willing to summarize things once I
realise where I have been not understanding.
that FAQ entry regarding "does running a relay give better anonymity"
concludes with "It is an open research question whether the benefits
outweigh the risks. A lot of that depends on the attacks you are most
worried about. For most users, we think it's a smart move."
This wording ought be a little tighter - as in "for most users"
implies there are "at least some users" for whom running a relay is
not a smart idea - who are those users, even who might they possibly
It might be obvious to others who those "other" tor users might be,
but it's not obvious to me, and I think it would be good to clarify
this point, if possible. If it is not possible to describe such a
"hypothetical user who could benefit from NOT running a relay", then
we should state that, admitting that we do not know for whom not
running a relay is a benefit, or could be a benefit.
The point is: It is good that we be as clear as possible on the
boundaries of our knowledge regarding these issues of tor and privacy
and anonymity (another two terms that would be good to carefully
define in an end-user Glossary page).
Is it advised for or against, for high-latency and/ or low-bandwidth
users (common in rural areas) to connect to a site (vpn or just using
the relay name as a bridge) where that site has its tor running as an
exit relay?
What if the site they VPN to is a normal 'public' bridge relay?
What if it is an un-listed (what I understand to be 'private') bridge (relay?)?
I am expected to advocate/install etc, for a small community of couple
dozen or so people.
I have read this:
Which answers "shouldn't tor default to all tor users being relays".
At the moment, I realise I am making certain assumptions about whether
one setup, or one connection method, is more, or less, 'anonymous',
than some other setup or method.
I have a duty of care towards those I assist. I am bound in my
conscience to assist people only by coming to a full and proper
understanding of the trade-offs of different setups that I could
advocate for.
My point is, the exit relay I installed is a 'public tor relay' - as
in it is not configured as 'private', but is that what you mean? In my
mind 'public tor relay' could mean 'a relay not installed and operated
by you, but instead by someone else in the public and quite possibly
not trusted'.
Thank you for those man page pointers. That clarifies part of the
"how". Hopefully soon I'll have a solid "why" (or why not) :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to make Whonix really user friendly? Looking for 
I haven't yet read about how whonix works, but this has been on my mind:
Have a VM creator driven by debootstrap or similar type script that
depends on debootstrap to do early install.
I believe that a lot of developers and even some non-developers have
local or local-partial mirrors, and so debootstrap is in these cases
very quick.
Also, for those who have a (partial) local mirror, building an image
may well be quicker than downloading an image.
There are also those of us (like me) who live in rural areas and
mostly only have access to slow high-latency and low bandwidth (1GiB
per month) links to the internet - but I do sync a local debian mirror
every week or two.
So for me with a local mirror, if there were a small debootstrap like
package for creating a whonix image, that is certainly what I'd use.
That script or program could also be used to create a Linux
lightweight container too, rather than a full VM (breathes more life
into older hardware).
Now if that script is driven by a YAML configuration file (or .INI or
whatever you guys have chosen already, but I don't like XML), then it
should be easy to build a GUI on top of this Whonix-creator script for
customization of your new image (ie customization of the config file,
before the script is run).
This might be considered 'advanced install' only, but I do believe
that by facilitating the so-called advanced or power users, or
developers, you actually build a far higher loyalty to your project
much more quickly than you would otherwise. You see, we are the ones
who would build such images and install them for our friends and
acquaintances. We are the ones who advocate a particular solution/
option/ set-up, and more often than not do that installation.
So, you want to be pleasing us! Well, I should say, _we_ want to be
pleasing ourselves by making our own lives easier - we should firstly
target ourselves.
And of course, such a simple 'advanced user' design, of course lends
itself to easy image creation for download, for those who find the
'advanced' configuration gui too, daunting shall we say :)
Good luck

I like the idea of using humour.
And I completely disagree that "common vernacular can't be changed".
On the other hand, a "new brand" would be much easier to reposition
than the existing brand ("dark web").
The problem I believe is two-fold:
1) we need a new term - this the easy part
2) we need a good and significant reason for people to use it
When the two happen together, we get the change.
With only one, or the other, the current term will persist. If we are
ready with a great term, then when something big - even possibly the
existing wikileaks - 'we' can start using the new term. If it rings
true, it will catch on.
On the humour front:
Dark net
 -> Light net
 -> Illuminet
 -> so we are the Illuminetti ? :)
On a new brand:
How about the Free Speech Network ?
The term "libre software" (in english, as opposed to 'free software')
is slowly catching on (it's been a few years now since I and others
have been using it, but it is catching on), so I think another term
could catch on for freedom network.
If Freenet design is truly unable to be revived, we could perhaps, at
some point, second that terminology/term - the freenet.

The principle is, without anonymous speech, we have no true freedom of speech.
Just as, without toll-free and anonymous travel, we have no true
freedom of movement throughout our states/jurisdictions.
So we have laws purportedly protecting a journalist's sources, in some
countries, but with wikileaks we see leaks the likes of which we could
barely imagine in the past. Wikileaks, on the backbone of tor,
industrialized anonymous speech.

tolerable to neo-cons. It's sarcastic. And we can look at it as "the
network you should use when you are confronted by those who hate
freedom", in other words, it's not "freedom hater's network" but the
"freedom haters network".

I too seriously doubt that.
Well, I haven't read a lot, but I think there was this history of TOR
where a couple of blokes did what made most sense to them at the time,
and the government (I would attribute "opportunistically") chose to
fund that.
Pro-actively supporting/funding those technologies which are useful to
big-govt-self, in this case TOR, could be attributed as having malice,
but I tend to the "schizophrenic nature/ conflicting interests" side
of the debate.
Notwithstanding, TSOC is a prime opportunity, Juan (hint hint, nudge
nudge) to verify or otherwise disprove your "primary intent is one of
malice" position - if a well-written design document (including an
as-yet-unsolved trust model which you magically solve) for dir-auth
de-centralization gets rejected for a couple years in a row, your
hypothesis is then proven, and we'd all have a wonderful data point on
the evil-ness of the TOR-backers-and-string-pullers.
Until then, I do (hint hint, nudge nudge), encourage you to write up
your TSOC project proposal :) :)
Please. Please do. Please pretty please with cherries on top please?
Unrelated to but prompted by your question, I assert the following:
Google, (and I think TOR) started as a hacker- or uni- sponsored
"let's try this concept" project.
Ie, started by one or a few hackers with a great idea and usually
spouting (and I use the word spouting here intentionally) good and
magnanimous intentions (eg Google's "do no evil" as they used to say).
Concept works, within its parameters.
Concept takes off due to overwhelming (yet relative) effectiveness
(within its parameters) as  compared with existing 'solutions' for the
problem domain.
Funding offers comes in, with prerequisite of diluting ownership, and
most significantly, diluting control.
The hackers (fellow humans I do note), take the money, dilute their
ownership, and (most significantly) dilute their control. The
share-sale contract, at this stage usually private (I'm thinking
google and most startups here), usually carries condition(s) that
further funding be accepted, or at least, more of the same happens, in
particular with the IPO. Now there are shareholders. These
shareholders are superannuation hedge-funds, government bodies
(through proxies) such as the NSA, FBI etc, and more similarly-good
goodness (please note facetious tone at this point in my typing).
If the original developers/ controllers of the new-fangled concept
didn't lose control in the first round(s) of funding, they certainly
do at the IPO stage.
Basically, most humans take the money and run.
I.e., most humans are greedy, and put their personal wealth ahead of principle.
Thus becoming a large company carries with it:
- personal cashing out of the founders;
- the sociopathic nature of companies;
- diluted control;
- control of said company through acts of government;
- control by those with the most money (to buy the shares, or to have
enough group- or individual share-voting control to put in place
chosen sock-puppets (evil doers) at the helm of said companies;
- concentrated control in the hands of those entities which act
sociopathically (shed a tear, I do);
If one or more of the founders continue at the helm of such
sociopathic-by-nature-and-by-founding-constitution entities, then it
can be reasonably inferred that such founders are inherently with that
same nature;
witness the nature of humans; the five passions, the seven deadly
sins, a rose is a rose by any cow pat you see.
So for the thinking man (man in the generic sense, including woman,
but in particular, being s/he who has come of age within themselves,
which is different to actual physical age), what to do?
If we want a better future in 30 years, how can we achieve that?
Public statements of commitment to do no evil (does google even
pretend to say that any more at a corporate slogan level?), evidence
possible underlying good intention.
What is the next step?
Bind oneself (oh ye powerful tech hacker for freedom) to make no
compromise of means, for any purported ends.
Here is one example from which I draw some limited personal inspiration:
That's a tough road to hoe though. I say it's the only road worth
walking. I wish there were more. Often I experience emotional
satisfaction from the enslavement of humans - when so many fall, fail
to act in interests beyond self, I see that the way things are, is the
way they ought to be - humans --ought-- to be enslaved, since they do
not understand their own enslavement, which they appear to willingly
and enthusiastically work diligently and rush towards.
How is to one feel anything but "yeah, enslavement is entirely
appropriate for this lot called humans"??
As I've pointed out above, the cancer is in humans. The corporations,
and those who control and run them, are simply humans, humans lacking
in will to put principle ahead of personal profit.
Is the real problem the problem of we humans?
Frankly, from what I see in the world, the TOR guys are, within
certain parameters, doing reasonably well. I may be seeing a total
illusion, and I can neither prove nor disprove my feelings on the
So what am I left with, with proof of nothing? The existential
question, eh? I am left with myself and my memories of my actions and
feelings. Which memories and feelings would I like to take with me
from this world? (no, I'm not going to debate that which I can neither
prove nor disprove).
May your life experiences be worth remembering, fellow humans.

Exactly. Appropriate non-technical pseudo summarization. Do you want
the whole bloody paper copied and pasted into the email? I don't - I
appreciate the link, specifically addressing your point, thank you
very much! Have you read it?
May be so. And highlighting (your) concerns is a good thing. As I've
pointed out before, if I were actually in need of some level of
anonymity/security on the internet, and I were a newbie, I would be
very appreciative of your vehement notes of caution.
BUT, the TOR guys do have many published papers on many aspects of
TORs design over the years (I've even read a few of them) and they
describe why they've made certain of the technical decisions they've
made - eg centralization vs decentralization (or "a bit less p2p)).
Juan what I would like to see from your passionate desire to
communicate caution and sanity (which I really appreciate) is for you
to temper your passionate communication by, for example taking a key
technical point written about in a paper linked such as in the very
links put to you (us) here and respond in a technically meaningful
I accept your notes of caution, I really do. I even appreciate them. I
think your repetition (to a degree) is acceptable. But I do not accept
-your- handwaving, especially in the light of calling out the TOR
technical foundation design documents as "handwaving". Not cool.
Juan, the "game" goes both ways. You know that as well as anyone here.
No one could dispute that analysing the intent of all players involved
is a good thing to do. In fact, as you rightly point out, an
especially important thing to do in this TOR ('freedom communication
tech') environment.
Likewise, no one can dispute that (and the relevant people agree that)
some technical and other questions simply cannot be answered. We
cannot work in an idealised world, we must work in the world we live
I intuit that your primary point is that the TOR devs ought
acknowledge "we can only do so much, we can only program within the
limitations of the greater environment which includes problems a, b
and c, and there are potential or real conflicts of interest due to
funding sources, etc, etc".
Frankly, I see the TOR guys acknowledge all of this.
Juan, here is a classic statement which says nothing. On the other
hand, it implies "caution is warranted".
Also, the concept of "troll fishing" can be taken as far you choose,
of course - that is, try to expose they who you might  consider to
ultimatly be trolls (individuals with bad intent), by continually
bating and fishing for such.
It gets a little tiresome, but from a cold hard lets do the best we
can by all newbies perspective, I can't really fault you. That is,
putting up with tiresome is better than the alternative.
Getting a TOR dev canary thing happen would, I say, be useful.
Juan's valid point is that black pots and black kettles can be hard to
distinguish. Indeed it may not be possible for us to do so.
In such an environment of uncertainty, all due caution is always warranted.
Let's never self deceive eh?
And in the interests of not self deceiving, simply set the record
straight when you feel something needs to be set straight. That's not
feeding the troll. Feeding the troll is when you get emotional and
defensive, and frankly, in the environment/world in which we live,
testing all doubt and all concerns is a good thing. Juan is robust
enough to do this publicly and for this we owe him a debt of thanks
for being so persistent. So few humans give a shit for others you see.
Indeed. Nice to see we're all so relatively robust around here :)

- how phones are tracked?
- what TOR can and cannot provide, even in the best circumstances?
- how to load custom linux kernel firewall rules?

- what is a mobile phone stingray device?
- what is a virtual machine? how to run one?

At this point in time, there's no I2PBrowser for example, so TOR is
the only ready option for members of the Crackatinny tribe (from
outbak ya c).
For those with a little willingness to learn, I2P and GNUnet are
IMSEHO (in my so extremely high opinion) worthy of investigation.
GNUnet even has an apt-get installable gui - but I do not yet
understand it's design (haven't gone reading), so cannot speak at all
to it's potential, let alone it's usefulness today.
I2P appears to have a design with some benefits over TOR, although
TOR's current size has (I think) some real benefits too.
Nothing is yet ideal. More love is needed everywhere.
Ideally, start building physical (wireless would be most practical)
'run and control your own personal node and talk to others
individually' independent network, and run I2P or etc on top of that;
Happy creating :)

Correction, Azureus Vuze has both TOR and I2P modules built in, and by
some definitions, Vuze is relatively end user friendly, and an older
but functional version can be installed in Debian using your package
installer of choice.
Vuze provides a SOCKS proxy option with it's I2P module, and a wiki
page on how to configure firefox to send all its DNS queries through
the proxy, see:

using Whonix.

The GNS/ alternate distributed DNS thing is the bit I was specifically

I do share your assessment that Gnunet does not provide anything like
adequate anonymity.
GnuNet's GNS could be (I assume) run across TOR or I2P - this is what
might be interesting to explore (for someone who wants to get their

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor -> VPN Clarification 
I agree that the descriptions / ascii arts are probably not up to
scratch at this point.
Let's create some diagrams so we can talk about scenarios (this is
just a rough crack at it, please modify/ fix as needed):
vpn = virtual private network
vps = virtual private server
www = destination website/ public internet service
tor hs = tor hidden service
tbb = tor browser bundle
**) vpn then tor:
 -> vpn proxy -> VPN -> tor proxy -> TOR
 -> www | tor hs
 TOR = tor entry -> tor mid -> tor exit
and where:
 VPN = vpn client -> local isp -> vps/vpn isp
        -> vps/ mixnet -> vpn server/ exit node
The vpn client could be ssh, and vpn server sshd.
Alternatively the JAP client and JAP's backend, etc.
If you run an ssh vpn, say on a vps, then your "tor proxy" can run on that vps.
This is not recommended.
Although it gives some privacy against your local isp, you would need
to trust your vps isp (assuming you are running your own vps, for your
ssh based vpn) - not recommended since the vps isp will generally have
full root access to your vps (at least to the disk image/ files).
(The terminology here might need to be improved - tor proxy might not
be the right term?)
**) tor through vpn:
 -> tor proxy -> vpn proxy -> VPN -> TOR
 -> www | tor hs
This is better, since tor is running "on top of" or "through" the vpn.
The vps (or vpn mixnet) can still see that you are accessing the tor
network, but at least your local isp cannot (you get some local
privacy, only seeing you running ssh).
(BTW, why is ssh "visible" at all - surely there is a protocol to set
up an encrypted link, in full privacy? - should be a separate thread
**) vpn through tor:
 -> vpn proxy -> tor proxy -> TOR
 -> VPN -> www
Here your local isp might know that you're running tor, but not what
you are accessing (a vpn).
The vpn isp/provider will know (if they want to) what website you're
accessing, assuming they know it's your vpn account (or your vps).
So the only way this would be useful for much is if you don't need
much in the way of privacy/ anonymity against your vpn provider (in
which case, why bother), or your vpn is anonymous (ie the talk about
paying for your vpn/vps with bitcoin).
Also in this scenario, any Tor HS access would not get to your vpn at
all (if you're lucky :)
Good luck,

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor -> VPN Clarification 
Indeed they are.
If you don't feel competent setting up sshd and ssh tunneling say, or
managing the security updates for your own virtual private server, or
customizing your firewall and TOR configuration so you are certain
about what's travelling through what and across what, then yes, you
are likely to shoot yourself in the foot and is better to just use TBB
or whonix/ tails etc.
And unfortunately yes, there's no simple way to say "just do this
extra step and get extra privacy or anonymity or safety" - if there
were, it would be in the Tor FAQ, which you have read haven't you?
That FAQ -does- have some hints about next steps you might consider
taking to improve the ecosystem.
I suggest small(ish) steps and getting comfortable with each step as
you go. Just running VirtualBox may be a significant step for you, if
you have not done that before.
Good luck,

@_subject: [tor-talk] surveillance discussion in Finland 
Pesky ethics eh?
What non-technical grounds besides "it's not ethical" result in "we
should not have mass surveillance at all"?
I'd like to see "the people don't consent", but sadly sheeple almost
always tacitly consent, given a gradual enough deployment time frame
and approach.
Where does the will of "we the people" ever prevail? Only where enough
people stand/ oppose/ speak up in ways which are effective, which
rarely occurs.
What about the "it's not ethical" part? Or is "it's not ethical" just
code for "the people would probably object if they had a genuine say/
vote, but they don't so we can ignore the will of the people"?
A technical foundation for why it's not OK is a good start I guess.
But can be overcome with legislation - surely the Finnish Constitution
permits of "national security" against "terrorists"?
Ahem. What they want or what is legislated for now, is just the thin
edge of the wedge, surely?
Slippery slope, the sliding wedge. Why would the medium-term outcome
for Finland be any different to USA/NSA?
These two points don't properly go together - "Facebook" is a corp.,
data retention can be required to be national-local, by legislation,
and legislated MITM. Facebook might respond by officially closing the
door on Finland?
Why illegal?
Well that does sound very good. But that's Finland constitution, not
EU constitution right?
Either way, a good foundation for Finland.
Effective will usually be trumped by "constitutionally lawful
legislation", although as we see with USA, power-hungry entities
legislate regardless of constitutionality over the longer term.
["threads" = "threats" I assume.]
Ahh, so Finnish constitution does permit of violating inviolability of
personal communication in the name of "national security"!
In that case, the proposed legislation should be easy for Finnish
parliament to pass.
You are indeed optimistic.
I don't share your optimism. Problems can easily be legislated away,
and "the people" will nearly always lap it up. E.g. "suitable
administrative processes must be in place to ensure that
non-applicable communications are deleted and forgotten when viewed as
part of an investigation".
Are these three coming together in Finland, in this case?
Good luck Finland!

@_author: Zenaan Harkness 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Historically speaking, 
Easy words definitely +1.
My take on 'controlled opposition' is that TOR effectively collects
most/ many of the "Snowden's" of the world who might be considered
"USA opposition". By collecting them onto one network, the "important
targets", although mixed with not important targets, are collected
into one technology and therefore much easier to identify - correlate
TOR users with ISP sign up accounts.
Years ago a friend coined the term the FOG - the False Oppositional
Group. In many cases of community issues here in Australia, one or two
people "offer" to "lead" a committee to "fix the community problem",
and we have seen time after time, these self-proclaimed leaders get
the large initial group on a tread mill of ineffective tasks and
activities - like writing letters to parliament, like walking down the
main street of their local town, like ringing the radio station, and
endless more tasks which achieve absolutely nothing.
This FOG committee then also belittles ideas which might have traction
(e.g. class action lawsuit, civil disobedience) telling their group
"oh that can't work" and similar. Over time, the people in the
community who are active (but ineffective direction activity set by
"saviour" committee) initially, die away (leave the group, stop
participating), since no progress is ever made.
This is extremely effective tactic by e.g. developers who want to
develop seaside foreshore multi billion $ developments, significantly
blocking the surrounding property owner's significant sea views. In
three years, 500 people is reduced to about 5 "hard core" genuine
people, by the 5 "False Oppositional Group" committee members. More
details available but already probably too much.

Don't sweat on it - the cliff might be better/ more comfort, than
knowing more :)
Some things in onion web bring tears. Some things our governments do
bring tears. The world is sometimes a harsh place.
I described Juan's terminology, my interpretation anyway.
Search e.g. GnuNET, I2P, etc - these are different software stacks,
not forks of TOR stack. TOR fork might not make sense - one of the
security benefits is the large number of people using TOR - then you
become a "needle in the haystack". Same for other networks, more or
The centralized parts of TOR need to be (at least partially)
decentralised, at least for scalability - TOR currently will fall over
if most of Internet tries to use it on one day. So if you are a
programmer have a go - you will be welcomed.
If you trust TOR devs (and centralised TOR network parts) as
"benevolent dictators", then theory says TOR network can be more
secure. Personal opinion's on actual security of a particular web
surfing activity in current actual TOR network, are probably only
relevant to the individual who owns the said opinion :)
I suggest that you try to avoid "are you for me, or against me" - it
is not useful. Sharing ideas is useful. Highlighting blind trust is
useful, highlighting unseen assumptions, and unseen facts (thank you
Juan!) are useful activities. Assisting each other's understanding,
even if we differ in opinions on small things (all things are small ;)
 is more important than saying we do or do not oppose one another.
Juan rowed a tough road for some time - he kept highlighting the USA
government funding at the core of TOR, and highlighted assumptions
some of us made. Some people take his brash manner as though it is
oppositional - yes it is oppositional to institutionalised human
killing, as so we all should be, and his language is sometimes harsh;
but for me, if I actually had need for some level of genuine privacy
and/ or anonymity when using TOR and my mind be sleepy, then Juan's
voice is very much needed by me and my sleepy mind! Juan says "wake
up!" and he also often adds "you fool!" - ignore the second part and
you will enjoy most people :)

popular news sites into a content addressed darknet/ localnet cache,
so that folks can browse the daily news without using exit nodes.
Trust network above that is a separate task entirely.
For bonus points, have the content addressing be in git.
Just as the disadvantages of HFT (high frequency trading) can be
handled with a trade-window model (all trades are batched into a 1s,
or 10s or whatever window to be resolved by the exchange at the end of
each window), "inhibit packet until ready" makes me think this might
be applied to Tor networks - specifying a "relatively high" minimum
latency for new session initiation. But again, it's the type of
problem/solution potential which needs genuine analysis to know if
there's going to be a non-trivial privacy enhancing benefit. I can
only make assumptions sorry.
E.g. your entry point (e.g. ISP) introduces "random peak bandwidth
drops/ latency holes" and when the ISP's incoming networks fail to
keep up their side of this same bargain, the link deteriorates
This implies an ISP who is on the side of the users, at this point a
rare thing (if it exists at all).
This 'feels' like it has potential. Except I think it presumes that at
least your starting node(s) (eg ISP) are not actively adversarial to
you - but are we assuming this anyway with current Tor? (Sorry for my
A thought I've pondered for a couple years now - and now in this
context, let's say my geographic neighbour and I each have an ISP
uplink, and wireless connection between one another.
If my "underlying fill traffic network" (physical/PHY layer, at least
from my perspective as an end user) can somehow include the private
connection between my neighbour and I, and if the ISP actively targets
one of us and crimps the connection, and then the neighbour similarly
("pro-actively") crimps his connection in 'almost parallel', could
this provide some level of plausible deniability of the exit-node
traffic being correlated to either one of us?
(Expand algorithmically to more than one neighbour.)
Is it worth beginning an "ISP end user fill traffic protocols best
practices RFC" for those ISPs who genuinely want to do the right
thing, legally as well as by their customers?
Or is the multiplexing of the last-node-before-the-home (eg the ISP's
DSLAM ADSL modem bank) simply not capable of such things?
I guess what I'm asking: what's the ideal way to roll out
community-/state- wide internet networking infrastructure, from a
respect-the-uesrs-privacy perspective?
Let's keep asking the questions and attempting to answer them, and see
if we can't eliminate the benefit logically (without having to wait
for a high fallutin' acamedic paper).
Eg 1: there are fibre-optic "DSLAMs" (modem banks? - dunno the term
sorry), which simply broadcast all client downlinks to all end-points,
and it's only the end point modems which "do the right thing" and
ignore their neighbour's traffic.
In this scenario, there may only be 2Gbps of bandwidth shared amongst
1000 homes. If all homes jump on the "maximize fill traffic"
bandwagon, each will get at most a fixed 2Mbps link - fast by many
standards, but nowhere near what would be achieved in a
forget-about-privacy scenario.
And then, what should happen at the ISP level?
What sort of protocols would make sense for ISP interconnection - to
other ISPs, to upstream ISP/ national backhaul, to international
(usually expensive) links?
Eg 2: ADSL DSLAM - can this device scale reasonably to all homes
connected to this DSLAM?
In either scenario, do we need to start thinking new equipment, or
just new protocols - since fill-traffic is a type of protocol and as
we've read, proposals have been made for ethernet-level fill traffic.
Clear thinking, ask the hard questions, gather answers, write it up in
an RFC or draft "paper", post for review, and it'll eventually get
archived at the usual places - even if the answers are "we can't do X
and Y for reasons A and B" - these would be very useful answers.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB: "on/offline" button in toolbar 
Hi, I am familiar and very content with the Firefox "toolbar-buttons"
plugin - which provides a couple of key toolbar buttons, such as:
- work on/offline
This allows e.g. for sites which insist on messing with my cache
settings/ sanity and reloading the dang page when I go back and or
forward in tab history, to do the following 3-step:
Work Offline -> Back (prev page in history) -> Work Online
more quickly than navigating through menus - which is quite the
frustrating experience when one does this often.
This is useful as I can get a very quick redisplay of a previous (or
subsequent) web page in my history without the site reloading it
unnecessarily which seems to happen on so many sites these days.
- proxy toggle (3-way)
This button does what it says, cycling through:
no proxy -> auto proxy -> manual proxy
Again, this is a great time saver in certain situations.
I guess we can be confident that others will have their own favourite
time saver buttons from Toolbar Buttons plugin.
Is it possible for some TBB dev to audit Toolbar Buttons firefox
plugin for security/ safety and/ or inclusion in TBB?
I will be very grateful.
Thank you,

I applaud and share your enthusiasm and intention. But.
The assumption that "enough money will solve the problem" is generally false.
What is needed is a supra-tor or supra-"supplied by the govt/ isp"
physical network layer - or at least enough nodes in a 'slightly new
design' network which can use those nodes (assuming there are enough
of them, which might be large number, I have no idea).
That means individuals setting up their own links between them and
their neighbors. Neighbors is a loose concept - wireless links can hop
a fair distance.
The principle is:
- if you don't control it, if you did not physically set it up, it monitors you;
- if you don't install and 'control' the software running on the
hardware, it monitors you;
- if your hardware is backdoored before you receive it (e.g. built in
hidden other-than-wifi radio, keylogging cpu microcode, full hidden
net sniffing computer in your ethernet port), notwithstanding the
software you install on it, it monitors you.
There is so much room for necessary improvement that the situation is
depressingly grim.
TBB/Tor is at least something - just be sure you understand what it
is, and what it is not.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Revolt Against Tor Over Rape Claims, Process, Board, 
0) The processes and actions done and upheld by those carrying seats
   of power in Tor Inc, with respect to Jacob Applebaum, are abhorrent.
   Justice has been denied to all involved.
   Serious problems have been caused to those who are genuine and or
   potentially genuine victims, and these problems continue to be
   perpetuated by those with authority in Tor Inc.
   Lies and deceptions have been ignored, outright denied, or otherwise
   perpetuated under the aegis of Tor Inc.
   Abhorrent behaviour has been ignored, upheld or indeed to a casual
   observer, have resulted in promotions of authority within Tor Inc.
   All these things are an absolute disgrace and those with authority in
   Tor Inc ought be fundamentally ashamed of the approach you have taken
   and continue to uphold:
      - implicitly,
      - tacitly,
      - and explicitly.
1) Tor is on topic for public consciousness around online privacy,
   anonymity, etc. and your question implies a fundamental missing of
   this fundamental point, and our fundamental needs in a democracy,
   and therefore the significance of that which is occurring at
   Tor Inc and within "the Tor community".
   The available options for those seeking a higher discourse are few
   and far between.
   The significance of the fundamental problems that are occurring as we
   speak, within Tor Inc and the Tor community, is deep, of deep
   concern, and is seen by far more than the mere few who take steps to
   highlight the wrongs and or to improve the situation.
2) Wikileaks is much harder to censor, unlike other recent publications
   e.g. the call for a 24 hour boycott of the Tor network was swiftly
   censored.
   There is an evident campaign to censor genuine and sincere, and
   needed actions and communications in regards to this whole affair.
3) Some of those with power in Tor Inc appear, to some of us in
   "the tor community" as being one or more of the following:
   -  fundamentally compromised ( e.g. lawyer, also "victim", also
      "investigator" - are you absofiretrucking serious??!!!??!! )
   -  covering for other compromised Tor Inc power brokers
   -  tacitly consenting to evidently compromised Tor Inc power
      brokers by ignoring, and or focussing on how to "massage" the
      "public message" so as to "minimize damage" (to what? to Tor Inc?
      What about damage to principles? damage to the community? damage
      to the dreams and intentions of hundreds of unspoken folks who
      gave their good intent, their hearts and often their time and
      money to contribute to the Tor network???)
   -  refusing to call a spade a spade
   -  evidently compromised due to covering for other Tor Inc power
      brokers who have demonstrated fundamental sociopathic and/ or
      highly objectionable actions, behaviour and words
4) Wikileaks has public mindshare and visibility.
5) Getting published on Wikileaks makes it much harder for those who
   want to appear clean-faced (Dingledine etc) to ignore the fundamental
   problems which have happened, are continuing to happen, and are, to
   the eye of this not so humble observer:
      - ethically objectionable,
      - compromised
      - and fundamentally problematic in oh so many ways!!!

those individuals who are evidently compromised in ways that can not be
Fail to take these steps and you will forever lose your ability to claim
"we did our best" or "we didn't see what we were doing".
If you cannot see, and you refuse to see when the problems are pointed
out, you will have none but yourselves to blame. Many of us are doing
our best to point out fundamental problems, and we get either banned
from the public discussion (Juan, Afalex and others), booted from the
community or Tor Inc (Jacob Applebaum and implicitly quite a number of
others it has turned out - it's all coming out in the wash in that
grande olde thing called the Internet - you might have heard of that?)
or shouted at to "get off the cross, we got work to do".
Yes, you sure do... plenty of work to clean up this mess - continue to
pretend it does not exist at your peril.
By holding yourselves out as a "leading light" of free speech, dissodent
speech, genuine anonymity and or privacy whilst online, and also a
purportedly fundamentally ethical approach to the activities Tor Inc
purports to champion,
   -  you have been,
   -  are,

held to a high standard. This is not your option. Tor Inc is not a
"normal" company - none of you (employees of Tor Inc) are held by us in
the Tor community as "normal" employees or "regular" folks - we have
been, are, and shall continue to hold you to a higher standard than we
hold "normal" capitalist 'pigs' to.
That also means you suffer a far greater disgrace, and far more
publicly, than most other normal people ever would suffer.
And this is simply how it is - it is not something you have any control
over. It is we, the Tor community, who choose how to hold our so called
and purported (even though self elected) "leaders".
You have no choice in the standard we hold you to.
You have no choice in the consequences in our minds and in our hearts
when you fall from the grace we previously assumed you to be in.
You have absolutely no choice in the long term default consequences in
our respective consciousnesses, each of us individually, of how we hold
each and every one of you in the face of your words, your actions, and
your non-actions.
And take good notice - it is perhaps most often your non-actions, which
demonstrate your tacit support for evils done, which have the greatest
consequences in our consciousness.
Meet our (!!) standard and you shall stand as heroes.
Fail to meet our standard and you and your purported principles shall
forever be "the ones who fell from grace, disgraced themselves and
disgraced the community, spitting on the very principles we all held to
be sacred and inviolable".

This can only partially be achieved at the moment - think "network
shock testing" by a state-level actor (i.e. someone like NSA who has
pervasive network monitoring, and some link-level control) - so you
have say a juicy government leak, whip it up on your local Tor
'anonymous' web server, and the state actor, monitoring the
underground forum you happen to mention your leak on, floods your IP
connection with 100 tor connections, then after only ~3% of the
download each, disconnects those 100 connections simultaneously.
The immediate and corresponding drop in bandwidth consumption by your
particular mobile phone computer is noted, and thereafter you are
specifically targeted in other ways.
Being able to publish, and being able to publish pseudo-anonymously,
are different things, and pseudo-anonymous publishing will not be
removed from Tor, but please be aware of its limitations.

the current devs would lose their credibility, so don't worry about

Perhaps keybase needs to be forked due to some fundamental
limitations? (it is libre source yes? - before this thread, I'd never
heard of either of these projects...). Perhaps the keybase devs are
aware of such fundamental "problems"?
"every site has it's own CA"
That's a burden upon site operators that will never be "widely"
achieved - except perhaps the large blogging platform providers,
facebook etc.
When a site can use HTTPS, users can create identities on the site,
and then users can use perfect forward secrecy with throwaway keys for
"ephemeral" communications, really, what does some new CA per site
actually provide?
I'm just not getting the significant value proposition or even
properly understanding your use case and why most people would bother
with all your proposed infrastructure.
Without a significant "value proposition" for the sites, or for the
users (and implicitly perhaps for the sites as a result of that),
who's going to bother?
But then I'm biased - neither do I understand the value proposition of keybase.
In other words they've delegated part of meta data protection back to
the user "you'll have to use a throwaway email account if you want any
anonymity in your keybase communications".
So you're building a messaging platform?
Or building infrastructure which you expect others to build messaging
platforms on top of?
So what value does it provide (sorry, I'm a slow learner).

After seeding your local cache with peers by doing a torrent download
with something like Red Hat/ Fedora, then afterwards, downloading most
"magnet" links works in relatively short time - i.e., your peers have
a DHT and/ or some built in (hidden to the user) search mechanism to
download the torrent file (torrent meta data file).
That meta data file has enough information to download the pieces of
the full torrent, and your peers all pitch in.

Tor Inc presents itself as a certain type of entity, via its website and
other forums of communication, the statements of its employees and also
the non-refuted statements of the users, volunteers and other supporters
of tor.
This generates certain expectations in the "members of the community",
which align with my comprehension of the terms "freedom", "information
about the entity Tor Inc" and "freedom of information".
How much those in control of Tor Inc release in response to grarpamp's
"FOI" request, beyond that which they statutorily release to the public
already, is a matter for them, their courtesy, their sense of proper
behaviour, their desire to meet the expectations of "the tor community",
their sense of duty to disclose to this community, their personal
principles, their need to manage the fallout from recent events, and
their willingness to demonstrate certain principles which we in the
community clearly expect, including transparency, honesty, and trust.
Let's be generous in our expectations of those directly inside Tor Inc
meeting this simple genuine and frank request, and at the same time
let's be cautious and publicly curious in respect of any "no" responses.
As always, let's assume good faith in general and keep our communication
as constructive as possible.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Project Corporate Document FOI Request 
As follows:
1) The "tor community" as we consider ourselves collectively, are under
the umbrella of Tor Inc.
2) As said many times in the past, and loudly proclaimed on the tpo
website, both Tor Inc, and therefore the community that has arisen under
its aegis, consider certain principles as foundations of our community,
and as reasonable expectations (and frankly, stated intentions) to be
achieved - transparency, privacy, anonymity, trust etc.
3) The term "FOI" hints at this "duty" we project upon Tor Inc, it hints
at our community members' expectations that this particular request be
treated -not- as a flippant "oh by the way, can I get a copy of all
these documents", but a little more seriously, to treat the request as
sincere, genuine, in the interests of the community, and that likely a
lot of us onlookers ("community members") will in fact be treating the
response to this "FOI" request with this level of gravitas.
So, it was not only an entirely appropriate term to use in this request
that grarpamp made, matching what "we" consider a "duty" of a sort, upon
Tor Inc, pursuant to its position in this community, but gave a little
hint to those who actually care about this community, who care about the
fallout happening at the moment, and who care about the truth, to keep
our eyes open and perhaps, respectfully, do our bit to support this
Why that cannot be considered eminently reasonable?

A very good question. Not many have answers, especially those who have
suffered in such situations.
Unfortunately "SJW" has taken on some denigrating meanings, since quite a
few SJW poseurs have popped up here and there and often times ended up
creating problems, which have in some online communities persisted for
An answer?
Fistly, identify if someone is being bullied, and second, if the target of
the bully appears strong enough to handle the "bully".
If not, or if you are unsure, talk with the targetted one offlist and
check in to see if they're ok or would like any offlist ear to talk to.
For the one who is conscientious, such communication comes naturally and
hopefully contributes to a stronger, all around warmer community.
Those who just love to go at it hammer and tong at each other, well,
perhaps sit back and enjoy the view, and if the view is too personally
distressing to you, consider Ye Goode Olde Kille File - it's not that
hard to change the view. I personally find it difficult to restrain myself
from leaping into the fray on one side, then the other, rather than simply
sit back and enjoy the view. I personally really enjoy it when individuals
are strong enough to joust back and forth, and back, and forth, then do it
all again tomorrow. Can't get much better entertainment.
Thirdly, if you feel that you personally are being targetted by a bully
and that you are finding it challenging, or really not coping, I suggest
saying less where possible and reasonable, and identifying one or more
individuals whom you consider would be receptive to you and listen to you
with empathy.
NOW, if you are unable to identify such a receptive, empathetic individual
within your chosen community, you are going to find it tough going and I
don't have much more in the way of suggestions for you, other than to find
a community with like minded individuals. Forums are not so difficult to
create these days, and if ultimately your version of a warm and caring
community requires moderation, you may have to experience that pathway in
your own little online community to discover how that goes...
Good luck

I agree with you. Some say "naming and shaming" is the way - I say naming
bad behaviour, publicly, is not shaming.
Naming simply says "Hang on, that's threatening, are you serious or
letting your words preceed you?" or "That's agressive and likely hurtful
communication, do you care to rephrase or retract?"
These types of public naming are very good, often useful, and I do
recommend them - should be on the list of standard possible responses I
For those who care, I think this discussion you are spearheading is very
In any particular "community", if there's not at least one other person
who 'cares', my default suggestion is move on, find another group.
I agree with you, and in hindsight I can see I failed to state the pathway
of naming the "bad behaviour" publicly - just make sure to not get sucked
in to your own ad-hom or other emotional type attacks, because then its
all over, you're in the gutter and no better than the purported bully.
I completely disagree. It's only a losing game when one of the individuals
involved is repressed. When all parties are not in the slightest repressed
by the vehemence, vitriol or other intesity of the 'conversation', then
the conversation is great entertainment.
Neither you, SJWs, nor anyone, will ever convince me otherwise. There are
actually people in this world who will take verbal blows from any and all,
in order to learn how to joust, in order to cut to the chase, in order to
(try to) identify bullshit as quickly as humanly possible.
It's a very useful skill to be able to go hammer and tong for a few
rounds, then turn around in the few minutes and discuss technical details
of some computer program - with the same person. That's liberating. That's
a sign of being able to handle your emotions.
Sure, some people, perhaps most, are not there yet. And warm cosy
comfortable 'communities' are just what the doctor ordered for those who
are unwilling to stretch such personal boundaries.
I heartily agree - and some people enjoy "vigorous" communication, they
consider vigorous communication not only "does work", but "works very
well, thank you very much, and by god I'll verbally crucify you should
dare to take my entertainment away from me".
And we have these incredible devices called computers and programs where
with the click of a few buttons, a whole new forum with rules, moderators,
mechanisms for joining and giving the boot etc can be had. That's amazing.
Anyone can create whatever genre of online "community" they think will
save the world (or at least meet their personal expectations of a healthy
community). This is an amazing system. It is available to everyone. Make
good use of it if existing "communities" do not satisfy.
And some people are totally ok with that. We cannot have all people on
this earth in one community - there's too many people, and most of them
want things just right --acording to their own idea of right--.
This idea that each "community" should be "comfortable" for everyone who
comes across it by chance or invitation, is a total firetrucking fallacy.
Humans are different, and value different modes of communication. Failure
to recognize this fact will almost certainly lead you into personal
emotional heartache.
Some people are able to find peace in being able to receive an emotional
personal attack tirade, and ignore it as though nothing happened. And even
more still, be able to immediately have a constructive conversation with
that same person who just delivered that tirade - as I said, to reach such
a space is liberating, but it is certainly not for everyone!
Except for those who want the personal lesson of learning how to not react
to overstepped boundaries. Without teachers (those who overstep
boundaries, at least apparently in conversation) how can I ever learn how
to handle such shit?
There are all sorts of people, and all sorts of communities which are
constructive, useful personally, productive and wanted by all sorts of
people. And we have the computer systems in place to make instigation of
such online communities essentially a trivial exercise.
It is so easy to be blinded within myself as to other people's ideas of
justice, appropriate or useful communication, etc.
When a genuinely good intentioned individual is lynch mobbed out of a
community, notwithstanding that individual's personal failings, then we
all suffer a tyranny.
When the "negative" type of "SJW" takes the ousted one's seat of
authority, that community is surely on a death spiral.
Choose wisely how you speak.
Good luck

This is a valid approach. Where you have an individual receptive to your
position that you put privately, it may be "successful". If not, others
may be able to assist. If not, involve the whole community. If there's
unanimity against your view, find another community.
These are valid pathways of course.

Probably. I hope my subtlety precedes me - you know, like the 'Dalai Lama

I have been one to leap in (often to my superficial detriment by the way).

fighting is so yesterday, and can we be robustly firm with a bit of arm
wrestling since blood and bruises really are too personal and
fact-oriented ok so just all you stop now ok and stick to arm wrestling
cause you know that's the type of jousting which is ok.
Good for you! Great to hear your view, position, belief, and even any
vehemence you might have about that. Say, even feel free to throw some
verbal knock outs my way if you wish :)
YOU may have, by the click of a few buttons ANY type of forum and
moderation you choose.
Deal with it, do it, or ignore it, but I suggest you stop pushing your
religion of "warm cozy politically correct communication where even
onlookers feel warm and cozy is the only true way".
You didn't hear me above (I spoke of being an onlooker and the

@_subject: [tor-talk] Graffiti "rapist lives here" at Jacob Appelbaum's 
This is internet bullying, descended into an internet lynch mobbing,
descended further into physical net vigilante crimes.
The mindset allowing for such descent, and such crimes, I believe arises
from the not-handled suppression/ repression from our government organs.
When we don't handle the bully in our face (papers please show your
license, insert this piece of plastic into an orifice of your body so we
can verify your DNA^Bblood alcohol level, your bank account has just been
fleeced for your oustanding $3K of fines since that's all you had stashed
their and we will take the rest next time you pass, etc etc), we repress
ourselves. We have submitted to a bully, we have accepted by default
(tacitly) an injustice. We are leaving the problem to the next guy as
well, and to who knows perhaps our grandchildren. And the problem is, we
are not leaving the same problem, we are leaving a bigger problem because
the bully got a little bit more confident with his/her bullying.
There are state sponsored bullies, and there are individual bullies.
And the sense of powerlessness which arises since we let so many bullies
(mostly the state sponsored ones) prevail in our weekly lives, leving
these bullies "to the next guy", is a foundation which is ripe for YOU
jumping into a lynch mob!
"Oh look, a single non state sponsored individual who REALLY did something
wrong! Yeah let's crucify him! Crucify him now! I know the courts are
fucked and the police are corrupt, so we must crucify him/her NOW so we
can finally FEEL a bit of justice!"
Fact is, the foundation of a lynch mobber is one of intense cowardice.
The public cricifixion is nothing but a release valve, and the weak (non
state sponsored) individual target of the mob, pays a very high and very
public price for the cowardice of the many.
EVERY one must ask themselves, am I a coward? Am I not doing my part to
handle the bullies in my own life? Am I leaving the problems to the next
guy "who I'm so fucking grateful for, my heroes"?
When will I start living my part for the world I want to live in, which
starts in my own home, my own communities, my own country?
Or will I continue to cowardly leave shit to the next guy...

The following may seem cynical, resigned and fatalistic, BUT:
I am Mr ISP.
I run a few boxen and my hosting service, with some hardware level
virtualization, to provide VPSs to inspired individuals.
So my web front end takes a credit card, or some bitcoin, and configures
and spins up a brand spanking new VPS.
The customer must have an initial log in to that VPS. a - I do an initial Debian install, and display the SSH key on the screen
for cut and paste.
b - I offer to receive an initial public key and insert that into the VPS.
c - I somehow provide end customer access to a "lower level" VPS
installer/ console.
Is there any other option?
Assuming option c, where I really go out of my way to maximise customer
trust in my administrative honour.
Now, if I don't actually have administrative honour, the files for the VPS
(e.g. when it's rebooted) or even the current live files (let's assume a
really radical memory-only "live Qubes VPS which dies on any software or
hardware reboot") exist at the very least in memory.
This is a unix system. The VPS files are, or can be mounted somewhere by
Or, I can just write a little memory scanner and look for the appropriate
location for the private keys in memory.
Here's the point: in a VPS situation, you are, absolutely, at the mercy of
the provider of the VPSes, and possibly to the providers of the data
Unless I'm really really missing something obvious about computer
security, your concern is a misunderstanding.

And given that any of the below is true (don't know, never met the guy),
such provocative, bluntly sexual, tacky gutter "humour" as he probably
intended it (and hey, perhaps some of that actually works to pick up
chicks - I wouldn't know, I'm not a chick) and the fact that the initial
email/ story of the "onlooker" which triggered the lynch mob has been
shown to be bluntly in error, we do start to get a clearer picture.
Some people really would get a belly laugh out of the below - just watch
any MSM hollywood "comedy" movie these days for the level of humour which
evidently sells a -lot- of tickets. Perhaps Jake was practicing for his
Hollywood debut? Perhaps Jake a compulsive social boundary pusher? Perhaps
these lines worked to pick up partners in the past and really, as in
really really did not work with ja.talk/ dungeonmaster (strange that a
dungeonmaster would get perturbed with penis jokes but hey, perhaps she's
a dungeonmaster with delicate sensibilities...
What I can say from personal experience is that some folks take such
attempts at humour as a violation of their god given right to ever hear
only swallows and tits (two types of birds btw) singing from the rooftops,
and only rainbows and daisy chains on a sunny Sunday morning to ever
assault their eyes. Mild innuendi shall be regarded with deep suspician
and gutter talk shall be vehemently, violently if necessary, stopped, at
least when I find someone to do it for me, like I dunno, may be a lynch
What is useful is that this particular episode of presumed subtlety (not)
on Jake's presumed part leads us to consider how to provide genuine
processes for actual justice in the face of real or potentially real
crimes (such as rape, property damage or battery of a human by a lynch
mob). I hope some sincere thought continues to be put to this.
Secondly, we are reminded that some cotton wool darlings will and do cross
our paths, and we also need processes to handle the fall out from their
unfortunately tarnished ears. Freedom of speech is definitely not for all,
so for those who desire something different to freedom of speech, we need
ways to handle those types, ways to encourage them in constructive
directions such as creation of forums where they personally are the
moderator, where individuals can feel as though their feelings are
respected and that they are empowered to unleash their perfect world into
a forum with like minded individuals.
And I am reminded that those who push the limits of social sensibility
need a really really thick skin. A thick skin is a good skill to have, but
the pushing part can still have sometimes very serious consequences, as we
may be seeing here.
Looks like ja.talk is knicker knot's needing to be presented as a "clean
look ma I'm only presenting facts" account, where dungeonmaster is her
"damn, the truth that I'm a one disgruntled woman lynch mob instigator is
coming out, and I'm still so reactive I have to try another tack but not
disrupt my first account" account. All postulation of course.
Yes, justice demands accountability. But accountability may be all but
impossible in a lynch mob and so ja.talk come dungeonmaster has possibly
done the most efficient possible exoneration if there was any real
wrongdoing which may now be impossible to properly determine.
I've never met Jake, nor read any of his words that I recall. Until this
thread, Jake Applebaum was just some guy doing a lot of work with the tor
crowd, and someone who Juan probably bitched about (Juan, love you bro,
never stop being you, not that you need to be told :).  But seriously, I
never would have remembered even that.
Now, well, this lynching brouhaha is something I will always remember.
Along with dungeonmaster's knickers (may peace be on them).
 Never knot your nickers 'fore that bad comedic stops,
 For if ya knot your nickers with a public lynching mob
 you may spit a royal dummy losing clarity and the plot!
 But more, listen carefully my ja.talk dungeon dear! No judge nor jury, yet executioner be you,

Bitdefender has discovered that encrypted communications can be decrypted

technique, dubbed TeLeScope, has been developed for research purposes and
proves that a third-party can eavesdrop on communications encrypted with

Bitdefender says the new technique "works to detect the creation of TLS

HelpNetSecurity, this vulnerability "makes it possible for a malicious
cloud provider, or one pressured into giving access to three-letter

Debian is about their operating system/ software distribution and
packaging, and the whims of the developers who are the only ones who get
to vote on anything.
See Debian's Social Contract, which is all about (free libre) software,
its utility and benefits, and even their "3. We will not hide problems"
clause is purely utilitarian and software based, and has nothing to do
about humans, rights, justice nor ethics! :
and Debian's Code of Conduct :
Debian fails to have any of:
   -  due process
   -  separation of powers
   -  right to respond
   -  right to appeal
   -  ethical foundation
   -  principled foundation other than utility
And before you leap in with an excessively quick "oh, you can respond,
just send an email" - take notice, if it is not written into the
foundation rights, there is no such right in operation in Debian!
So take your false beliefs and read Debian's foundation documents again
before embarrassing yourself publicly.
Fundamentally, with only a "be excellent to each other" hippy ethos,
tyranny can (and I say in the long term shall) reign supreme; despots can
hide, well intentioned idiots can pave abundant roads to hell, and all
without realising their mistakes nor the years of damage to their hailed
"community", since that damage is predominantly unseen.
Debian is no friend to ethics nor justice nor fundamental community
building principles - nothing more than the grandiose principle of
Yes, "free libre software" is indeed more useful than proprietary closed
source software. You heard it here first.
Debian? An excellent operating system for a certain category of
individual. Just don't expect your idea of community to remotely prevail
within the "Debian" project.

"all"?!! Please!
Classic dichotomy thinking! "It must be saintliness or abject evil."
Can someone be human, make mistakes yet be constructive in this world,
attempt to crack open some mind prisons for individuals here and there,
and sometimes succeed, sometimes not reach own standards? Have personal
things to handle, learn, improve on?
Is a human who does make a mistake entitled to speak to it, or to remain
silent, or to have a space where genuine communication with aggrieved one
can occur?
Did you read "The Weaponising Of Social Part 2: Stomping On IOError’s
Grave"? If not, perhaps go and read it now...
You apply the rules you choose to apply, in your own mind!
Most of us are mostly in self imposed mind prisons, self censoring,
endlessly bound in dichotomies, failing to bring empathy (a common
Westerner failing these days), failing to bring nuance to our
conversation, just leaping on a black or white lynch mob train.
We HAVE to do better.
If you have facts proving the theft, then I agree with you.
If you only have a feeling, or assumption, or "well he's the most likely
one", then YES, that IS a violation of due process, due care to one
another, due consideration of the types of conversations and society/
community we want to live in, to create by our conversations for our
children to live in.
If you can't live the law, the law is not real for you. If it's not worth
living, then it is not true/ natural law.
You are binding yourself/ your conversation to an unnecessarily extreme
legal think.
How do you --want-- to live? Who do you want to be? How would you want
people to think/ consider/ treat you in conversation in such
circumstances, or are we really wasting our time trying to wear another's
The law should only be a backup for when people -fail- to live the law in
their interactions - "the law" that goes beyond this is mostly artificial,
against our interests, against common sense, and destructive of community.
Please, let's try to lift the conversation. Now is the moment. Now is YOUR
opportunity to live a higher ethic (by your own standard, not mine) - live
the highest you are capable of and it WILL make for a better world.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question for those who say "Tor is pwned" 
It's foundation design issues. And hardware level network issues.
The code is generally (in the public conversation anyway) assumed to be
"best effort, bugs fixed relatively soon after they arise".
Again, you will need more nuance than "has the code been audited" if you
really want a relevant answer.
There's a lot of research out there, and also logic and discussions which
are straightforward to follow.
Next, once you've done some investigation, you start to come across a few
interesting factoids of note such as:
- lack of network chaff is a fundamental limitation, and problem for
  privacy (for those who need it) given current known data collection
  capabilities of the "five eyes" - all network meta data, and there is
  evident (I'm not about to search the lists, but you only need to search
  2.5 years (the time I've been watching)) resistent within "Tor project
  proper" to making this particular fundamental improvement happen;
  - arguments are put such as "oh there are no studies proving the
  benefits of network chaff" and the obvious "we don't have a budget for
  that (yet) but we encourage contributions"
- persistent push back against bittorrent over Tor, including threatening
  offlist email attacks against those who suggest as much;
  BT over Tor would provide some chaff, simply by increase of volume,
  load, unpredictability of end clients, for example.
- just watching TBB's behaviour has been interesting - some days, when I
  open up say 5 tabs for 5 different news websites using the "open all
  bookmarks from this folder as tabs" function, they all essentially start
  to load simultaneously, but other days/times, each tab loads distinctly
  sequentially, which to my mind is a dead giveaway that my current
  on-ramp is part of some sort of profiling (read 'deanonymising')
- configurable latency randomization is another technical improvement
  which has been bandied around for years, and sounds easy to my
  programmer mind in practice, but has yet to see anything like the light
  of day
There is ample room for an alternate dev team. Unfortunately, the US DoD
are the ones providing almost all the funding, so they get to continue to
control Tor development. If you are a big funder, start a whole new dev
team, in a -completely separate jurisdiction (if that's possible). I know
of an apparently well intentioned and productive man who may be close to
ideal to set up and lead such a team :)
Also, fundamentally we need a physical layer network which individual
humans in their homes and offices, actually control - that is, shift the
entire network to a "dark fibre" concept, where suburbs have random
connections to one another, neighbours connect to one another with
ethernet, wireless and more.
If you don't own it, you don't control it.
If you don't control it, it --will-- be used against you.
This is a long term (say 20 year) plan, but it's the only long term option
if we want to achieve anything resembling a genuine network of the people
which honours privacy and anonymity of communication.
By virtue of our capacity and existence and by the blessing of our
cognizance of these things, we humans are with the right to anonymous and
private communication.
We have the right. I encourage you to work towards a world where many can
live the right.

I don't share your aspersions - certain styles of communication, though
brash, may be just what's needed by an individual who actually needs tor
for something, but is a bit too sleepy to realise they need to up their
personal opsec game.
Again, Paul thank you for the time you spent responding here. Really
In situations where great personal angst/ emotional pain are experienced
by one or more individuals, I think we need to show a little tolerance to
the need for the members of a community to talk through their
conversation, to engage with one another - and yes, sometimes this will be
rough and or very distracting to say developement and helping users.
What's happened in recent weeks is about as big as it gets. And is also by
nature pretty rare. I am personally confident that the list will settle
down again soon enough.
If we really want to separate public discussions and offtopic but
hopefully related matters, or to "control" these, the question arises: Is
the Tor project willing to host a genuinely "off topic and unmoderated
(barring statute law in jurisdiction of origin) with firm intention to be
at least in some way related to Tor" type mailing list?
If not, we need to know so that we who want such a thing can have it. For
example I subscribed to tor-talk in the understanding that it is
unmoderated. I would personally like to know if the Tor project find this
list (or perhaps another with a slightly better name to remind people it
is unmoderated and separate it from end user support requests) untenable.
Many individuals seek community, yet some of course have different ideas
of what that means.
And what humans need or find useful is another matter.
Thanks for listening,

----- Forwarded message from carlo von lynX  -----
Performancewise it hardly makes a difference if you have a bit
of IP on top. I would guess TCP/IP buys you more flexibility.
To defy censorship all the systems use TLS to be harder to
distinguish from HTTPS. You can avoid that whenever you're
no longer running over the broken Internet. In that case
you can use UDP or even bake up a new wire protocol. For
Tor it makes no sense, as it depends on the old Internet.
gnunet already supports UDP as one possible transport.
UDP isn't as bad as its reputation. I've been using it for
cross-server notification for years. But when people start
having NATted and firewalled networks, it all starts looking

@_subject: [tor-talk] Reminder to stay on-topic 
And, any individual to be banned, when their posts are not outright in
violation of law or list policy, MUST be given at least ONE chance to
agree to "stop posting offtopic".
How can doing what was done, with no warning other than the general/
public "Careful now, we're discussing whether to start a new moderated
mailing list!" statement.
Seriously? This was an appropriate warning to all those who got banned?
And do those wielding this authority seriously think this will be
conducive to empathy with the tor-project, to a sense of "community" on
tor-talk list etc???
Even then I'd suggest at the least, ONE warning and therefore ONE
opportunity for the poster to comply with the demand thereafter.
When someone brings their heart to a conversation, in this example:
 - a woman
 - who knew intimately the accused
 - who says she found it difficult to stop crying at the allegations
   that kept pouring out from ja.talk postings
 - who spoke from her own experiences
 - who is an actual rape victim
 - who demonstrated a level of inner strength and courage to speak up
   in the face of an avalanche of public opinion (a literal lynch mob,
   whether founded on true facts or not)
And is treated in response with:
 - not even a SINGLE warning or request re her own posts
 - an accusation that she is a rape apologist
 - no right of reply/ response to the ban (the tor-talk list
   administrator personally kill-filed her)
 - no "thanks for your courage and empathy, but this is just too
   offtopic for tor-talk"
She was raped ffs, and she brought genuineness, her own reality/ soul/
truth, and Tor treats her this way?! Are the administrators out of their firetrucking minds?
Seriously, this is really, really messed up.
Except that somehow this tor-talk "community" clean itself up, or I'm
out of here - at the moment, your record is shameful, and damn, it
speaks for itself!
When a Juan brings his brash words, at least he has the heart to shout
When Cecilia brings her words, at least she brought her courage to speak
When Alex spoke out in support of Cecilia, and bared his soul, at least
he had the guts to speak his truth!
The rest of us?
Must of us? Fucking corwards!
Folks can create and run and administrate and moderate as many private,
semi public, and "public" private clubs as they do, with whatever rules
they choose.
Take notice, how you treat those who bring their hearts and bare their
souls, determines the so-called "community" you are creating by your
It is good to have technical forums, where non-technical discussions are
off topic.
But my expectation that Tor Inc was a direct supporter of freedom of
speech, open communication, whistleblowers, tolerance, "community" etc,
is dashed in the face of not even one list supported by Tor Inc, where
those who feel the need to speak their piece, can do so.

Taking out of context an "expressed suspicion" as a fact of name calling,

Classy. List administration at its best there Boyce. Not.
"Arbitrary justice", which you might like to inform yourself regarding,
is where "the rules" are not known in advance, and no concession is made
to those who break the rules, WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW THOSE RULES.
Your choice to allow "three weeks of unbridled posting" created in many
of our minds, a rule which we all thought we were following - ja.talk
kept reposting media crap, we had a right to respond (or so we thought).
Your executive choice to ban certain individuals who "broke" your rule
(because they went three weeks and ONE EXTRA DAY (let's say)), when you
NEVER STATED to us your rule about "three weeks is OK, but three weeks
+ one day and THEN you will be banned with no right to recourse nor even
any right to request me personally to change my mind" is EXTREMELY
You have told us by your actions as well as your words (besides a few
other things about yourself) that you WILL exercise arbitrary power
over real humans attempting to communicate their truth, their soul,
their pain, their attempts to find resultion on at least one of the
normally -most- challenging and difficult conversations we Westerners
have to confront, rape.
Aren't you a bloody hero now?!!
Three claps for Boyce, dispensing justice and facilitating community.
Clap, clap, clap.
"And those who broke my rule in the past, are now kill filed by me, and
even if you genuinely want to join and participate and abide by my
rules, well who gives a flying f*** about you, this is MY list, and I AM
the administrator, and I SET THE RULES!"
Three cheers for Boyce, bringing real empathy and humanity to the Tor
project, making the world a better place, cleaning up unsavoury posters.
"Boyce, doing the Right Thing (cause he said so)."
Of course. As I too have said.
And we are now clear on your choice to exercise your predatorial right
to arbitrary exercise of power. Fascism in action.

I agree. But Tor Inc, and the so-called "volunteers" who run this and

tor-talk is about to be replaced with tor-users.

"Users are dum" in this context is not pejorative!
It means many tor users these days, because it is so easy to use,

Users should be reading such terms extremely conservatively, and with
many "caveats", and the tpo website does not help them to assume these
caveats, so these dum users make all sorts of assumptions based on
intuitive and --common-- understandings of the terms as currently used
on the tpo website.
That can, and should, be named as false marketing.

Common understanding of terms used ("dum users") causes assumptions by
