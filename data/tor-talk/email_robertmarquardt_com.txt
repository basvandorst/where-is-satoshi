You could use a dedicated server which is maybe a good idea in  general, in case you run a exit node. And I mentioned both hosters  (KeyWeb and Strato) cause at least their terms allow Tor which isnt  usual for me.

@_subject: AW: tor exit-node abused, takedown by ISP, 
In fact most IPSs classify DMCA notices as abuse and if you do not respond they will probably disconnect your machine.
Another fact is that the mass of DMCA notices the copyright enforcement companies send to the ISPs could lead to a cancelation of your contract cause of the mass of "abuse". Or lead the ISPs to ideas like to charge extra per DMCA notice or complaint.

We should not forget that the court did not forbid the storage of data but rather criticised the specific legislation. It did not challenge the 2006 EU directive thats the basis of the law.
The only way to get rid of the data retention laws across europe is that the european union repeal the directive.

I recommend Keyweb ( we moved to them after Strato canceled our contract.
Just add a line in the comment field, during the order process, that you like to use the machine for a privacy service and care about abuse by yourself.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Up-to-date Repositories 
The stable version of Tor is currently 0.2.2.38-1 according to the website.
Does someone cares about the deb- and rpm repositories or are they deprecated?
The latest version in the repositories is mainly 0.2.2.35. Or is there another reason (except the lack of time) why 0.2.2.35 is the latest version in the repos?

Hello Andrew,
True. But on the website:  its stated different: "Do not use the packages in the native repositories. They are frequently out of date. That means you'll be missing stability and security fixes.".
And I would really welcome if The Tor Project would maintain the RPMS too.
Because I added the Tor repository on several machines with CentOS (serving as middle- and exit nodes) where Tor is not in the default repositories and outdated in the additional repositories.

Ok, I thought the latest RC is 0.2.2.35.
I removed Tor and updated the torproject.repo:
name=Tor experimental repo
name=Tor experimental source repo
Then I tried to reinstall Tor with the following result:
 [Errno -3] Error performing checksum
It looks like Repositories created using RHEL6's createrepo-0.9.8-4.el6 is not usable in RHEL5 + yum 3.2.27.

Austrian man is latest to be held responsible for traffic passing through Tor
An Austrian operator of Tor servers?that were used to anonymously route huge amounts of traffic over the Internet?has been charged with distributing child pornography. This comes after police detected illegal images traversing one of the nodes he maintains.
William Weber, a 20-year-old IT administrator in Graz, Austria, said nine officers searched his home on Wednesday after presenting him with a court order charging him with distribution and possible production of child pornography. The crimes carry penalties of as many as 10 years in prison. Police from the Styrian Landeskriminalamt, which has jurisdiction over the Austrian state of Styria, confiscated 20 computers as well as a game console, iPads, external hard drives, USB thumb drives, and other electronics. Evidence cited in the document showed that one of sevenTor Project exit nodes he operated transported illegal images.
He already has a lawyer and accepts donations for his legal expenses: PS: He ran ZhangPoland1, ZhangUkraine1, ZhangCzechRepublic1, ZhangAustria1, ?
