@_subject: [tor-talk] Logging on to Tor 
This will be the most naive question to the forum for some time but I
struggle with
accessing Tor.  After I loaded it I don't see an icon or start up on my
program list
so I have to do a search each time, wait for the results and then click on
browser, another wait until it appears.  If it doesn't I click again and am
it is operative do I want to continue whereupon it asks for a password I
have.  I bail out and wait until the system connects, if it doesn't I
restart and
start the whole process over.  I like the program, feel it does the job but
is a struggle I'm sure you can tell me how to avoid.
