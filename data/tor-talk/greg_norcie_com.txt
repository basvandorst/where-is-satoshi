I think (but could be wrong) that you can look at a bitcoin's history
and see who's given to whom and use that data to trace who the person
is, if they weren't careful. (Eg: if they bought from a bitcoin
exchange in the US which could have it's logs subpoenaed)
Anyways, those drugs have to get delivered somehow. I could see them
tracing it that way - old fashioned detective work.
Also there's the comedy option that Silk Road is a giant sting
operation. The FBI has infiltrated other illicit markets (mostly
carding forums).
I saw a talk by the FBI agent who was profiled in Poulsen's book. He's
not the most technical guy in the world, but he's _damn_ good at
undercover work. As in, he convinced a carder forum to change their
hosting to an FBI controlled server, where they then siphoned up IPs
and then went to Eastern Europe and worked with the local authorities
to have the main carders prosecuted.

Compressed sensing techniques?
We should keep in mind the barrier for introducing scientific evidence
in US courts is pretty vast. They still use MD5 hashes on forensic
images, because case law specifically says MD5 is acceptable.
Some crazy new correlation attack might be possible... but using it as
evidence in court would be quite difficult.

The thing about security is you need to understand, well, everything.
Networks, programming, psychology... you name it.
I think Eric S Raymond's essay on "How To Be A Hacker" is pretty useful:
Start making small projects for yourself. Install linux. Set up a web
server. Do some LAMP programming and set up a dynamic site. In the
course of learning basic systems admin skills, you'll pick up a lot of
security knowledge.

As long as the password isn't used elsewhere, it's not a huge deal -
security savvy users probably just use a throwaway password. The main
threat here is if you are reusing passwords.
Preset passwords might be a good idea, but I think in the grand scheme
of things, it's a minor issue.
Is this behavior that is easily changed in Mailman?

@_subject: [tor-talk] TB download improvement 
I did a Tor usability study recently, though admittedly with
participants who were English speakers (though a large chunk were not US
citizens and did not speak English as a first language). We termed a
failure to DL the TBB as "download clarity", and found it was the one of
the least cited usability issues.
I think the current UI is well tested and conveys information well.
However, off the top of my head, two small tweaks could solve the OP's
1.) Include small windows, apple, and tux logos on the download link on
the main tor page... these could serve as a symbolic cue that it is a
download link.
2.) Once on the download page, in the drop down list of languages that
is defaulted to "English" include a US and UK flag. Include flags from
representative countries in each language[1]. This is a common design
pattern on sites being accesed by many people speaking many languages
(eg: transit sites based in Europe)
Personally, I wouldn't go beyond very minor tweaks to the current
interface without a lab study showing that a statistically significant
number of non-English speakers had trouble DLing Tor.

I'd say as long as they didn't actively confuse users, they'd be a good
addition. Users who don't understand them will not be harmed, but those
who do recognize them will be helped.
Could you put a graphic that says "language" in several languages?
(Whatever the top 5/10 most used are). Even if someone isn't in that
set, they've probably seen similar design choices in airports etc
denoting the same phrase in many languages.

Your idea has sound logic - but doesn't the current TBB support this use
case? (Without attracting negative media attention?)
If you are suggesting a Flash-enabled TBB to allow these youths to view
videos, that could end badly - Flash can be used to deanonymize users.
If said users are so oppressed that viewing erotica could get them
arrested, that's a serious problem.

@_subject: [tor-talk] extension works in FF, fails in TBB 
Hi all,
My name is Greg Norcie, I'm a PhD student at Indiana University,
working on a project focusing on improving Tor usability.
This is a follow up to a paper looking at usability issues with the Tor
Browser Bundle.
The research group I'm leading is currently working on tweaking the Tor
Browser Bundle to test solutions to the issues we noted in a formal lab
study. (Our previous paper simply suggested changes, but did not
scientifically validate our suggestions)
One issue we noted was people feeling Tor was slow. Now, this is a
function of how Tor works - traffic passed through a series of nodes
will always have more latency than a direct connection.
So we are experimenting with a custom extension that pops up a message
to TBB users when a delay is detected, to see if reframing the delay
makes users tolerate the latency better.
However, we have hit a snag. While in a normal, run of the mill Firefox
install w/ the same extensions as the TBB, our extension functions -
delays are detected and a pop up box appears.
However, when we install our custom extension in the Tor Browser Bundle,
it fails to work. We initially thought this might be because our
extension was utilizing Javascript, but disabling NoScript doesn't fix
thes issue.
We're at a bit of a loss as to how to solve this issue, and are reaching
out to the Tor developer community to see if anyone might be able to
offer some insight as to what could be causing this failure. Our lead
developer recently left the project, so we're struggling to get things
on track in time for PETS)
The extension in question is available at the following URL
(password is "cryptoparty" - our uni's MegaUpload clone requires a
password for all files):
Any help anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated. (And of
course, it goes without saying we will be making our code available to
the Tor community)
Thanks for reading, have a great day.
