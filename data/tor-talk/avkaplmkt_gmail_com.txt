@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor service can't start with "CPU worker" error 
I've been running a Tor relay for almost 5 days now and it works great!
Unfortunately, I rebooted my server (which is running Tor) today, and
when I do "service tor status", I get the following:
PID file (/var/run/tor/tor.pid) present, but tor (1914) not running
I tried:
(1) Rebooting the server again
(2) running "service tor restart"
But that didn't help. So I looked at the logs (info level), and found
the following on the last lines:
Aug 27 16:53:24.447 [info] choose_good_exit_server_general(): Chose
exit server 'TOR1CINIPAC'
Aug 27 16:53:24.452 [info] circuit_handle_first_hop(): Next router is
[scrubbed]: Connection in progress; waiting.
Aug 27 16:53:24.452 [info] cpuworker_main(): CPU worker exiting
because Tor process closed connection (either rotated keys or died).
There seems to be a problem with the "cpuworker"? But what does that mean?
By the way, the default notice level tor.log did not show any errors,
but always end with 80% bootstrap as its last line...
The Tor I have is version 0.2.1.30 installed via yum from the
"torproject" RPM repository as indicated on the Tor website. Also, my
system is Scientific Linux 6.1 64-bit, which is RHEL without the
Can anyone help with this? I am eager to get my relay up and running
again. Thanks.

I just checked again, there are no "notice", "warn", nor "err" level
log entries...
I also tried the 0.2.2.27 beta, exact same problem. Should I file a
bug report? If so, I am not really should how I should describe it...

@_subject: [tor-talk] Don't use Google as default search in Tor Browser? 
Thanks Joe for the info.
Yes, I *do* know how to remove search engines, including the method you described.
However, I was suggesting that Google (and probably some of the other defaults) be not in the TBB to begin with, or at least not the default.
I believe this would make TBB more consistent in providing a private browsing experience.

Hi Joe, I definitely didn't take offense, and I apologise for sounding that way. In fact I really appreciate how informative this list is. :)
As for the search engine, would it still violate Mozilla/Google agreements if the default search engine is changed by the Tor Browser packagers (and not by Mozilla)? And I thought Aurora is already Firefox minus Mozilla branding anyway?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Don't use Google as default search in Tor Browser? 
I am inclined to consider the lack of privacy friendly default search
engines in TBB as a bug. Yes removing Google as the default should be
a trivial change.
Could any of the developers comment on this? Thanks.

I had the exact same question about secure delete. Also, securing
wiping the computer's memory is important, as sensitive data could be
recovered from RAM even *after* power off...

This looks great, will there be Windoze and Mac OS X binaries
available? Or is there documentation on how to build them?
Thanks for making this! Is there a road map for future features?

It occurred to me that the recent version of the Tor Browser Bundle
uses Google as its default search engine.
However, as we all know very well, Google actively tracks its users.
Despite the fact the the whole point of Tor, and indeed the
functionality the Tor Browser provides, improves anonymity, would it
be better to switch to another default search engine? This may be
DuckDuckGo, Scroogle, or others....

Can you give some pointers on dependencies and other per-requisites
for the software? I would be very interested in trying to get it to
work on Windows, Mac OS X, and other Linux distributions...
Again thanks for making this!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Email through Tor and VPN questions 
I recently setup my own Tor relay, and its exciting!
But I've had the following questions about Tor for a while:
(1) I read in a recent list posting that paid "private" VPN services
provides no anonymity. According to some of those providers, they
don't keep any log of your connections. Is this just a marketing
gimmick, or are there other reasons why a VPN service provides no
anonymity? Is there a side by side comparison between using Tor vs
(2) The Tor network discourages some uses of it like BitTorrent (and
other file sharing?). I can understand that from a bandwidth/speed
perspective, but if I want to share files via BitTorrent (such as a
GNU/Linux distro image), is there a way to make it more private?
(2) I am using the FoxyProxy addon in Thunderbird 6 to use Tor as a
proxy. Is this an effective way to improve my email privacy? The only
other possible issue I can think of is that my email headers are
"real", but I am not sure if that matters so much?
(3) The Tor website is now encouraging the use of the new Tor Browser
Bundle, and it seems that the TorButton Firefox addon will no longer
be supported for much longer. Does that mean the only way for
anonymous browsing via Tor is with the Tor Browser Bundle? Is there a
way I can setup usual Firefox for browsing that is just as good as the
Bundle? Perhaps by using FoxyProxy and other settings?
Answers/explanations for any or all of the above questions would be
great. Many thanks to the developers who made Tor the great service it
is today.

@_subject: [tor-talk] .onion address for SSH no longer works 
I've set up Tor on my server, including a SSH hidden service, replete
with its *.onion address. I've been able to remotely login via the
hidden SSH service.
But last week, after a package update to tor-0.2.2.33 (I installed tor
from official repo), and a tor restart, I get a connection refused
error when trying to access the hidden service. I checked and my tor
service is running normally, no errors in tor logs either...
How do I troubleshoot this issue?

OK. I've tried the above and they seem fine. In fact connecting to the
tor hidden SSH service worked briefly.
Unfortunately, I am getting the same error I got before:
Tor starts fine with:

After a few seconds, I check via "service tor status", and get:
"PID file (/var/run/tor/tor.pid) present, but tor (29865) not running"
I edited torrc to log errors, warnings, and notices, there are no
abnormalities logged... it seems that tor just stopped. This has been
happening in the past, and is still happening now after the recent
update to Tor v0.2.2.33. "service tor restart", nor complete system
reboot helps...
BTW, I am running Scientific Linux 6.1, and used "yum install tor"
from the following repo:
name=Tor and Vidalia
Can anyone help with this? I can't even begin testing the hidden
service before getting tor running first..... and this problem has
been bugging for the past two months... Thanks.

Just tried it. I started tor from where it is installed /usr/bin/tor,
same problem, no change in log entries.
