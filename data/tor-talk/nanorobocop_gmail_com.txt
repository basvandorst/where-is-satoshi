@_subject: Nodes selection algorithm 
Could you tell me please how Tor selects nodes for a route of traffic?
Does he select them really randomly?
As far as I see the only difference is for final route - it should be
from list of exit-nodes.
And also, what's the difference - Is Tor relay a exit-node or not?

Yes, that's true that I misunderstood the meaning of Host header. It's
the name or destination server, but not source. Got it now.
There're 3 options in TorButton about headers:
Set user agent for Tor usage (crucial)
Spoof US English Browser
Don't send referer during Tor usage (may break some sites)
But I see the effect only from first one when my UserAgent header changes:
my real UserAgent:
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.17)
Gecko/2010010604 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.17
changes to:
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US;
rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko/2009021910 Firefox/3.0.7
What exact tasks do you know?
Also, do I think right that it's quite useless to use Tor just as
proxy - it would work just as proxy. And it's much better to use
special plugins like TorButton to Firefox to set some extra settings
about hiding yourself. Am I right?

Oh, I got the meaning of exit-nodes: it's for selection the preferred
country as exit of your route.
But still the question is How Tor choose the route?

@_subject: Wireshark with TOR patch 
My name is Mansur. And I'm working on degree work about TOR network security.
I've seen that there's patch to Wireshark that gives you ability to
watch TOR protocol passing through Wireshark.
In fact, I have a problem compiling Wireshark with that patch -
there're some errors during patching.
And I wanna ask does someone have already patched and compiled version
of Wireshark - it would be very cool if you'll send it to me please!
Thanks in advance!
And here're messages during patching, maybe you know how to eliminate
them and complete patching successfully?

@_subject: TorButton and information disclosure on last OR 
I have a Client machine with TorButton (Tor client + Firefox + Privoxy
+ TorButton) and a Server machine with Apache.
But when I'm trying to connect from Client to Server through TOR
network I see that there's my information on HTTP-headers on Server
side that last OR gives to my Apache.
So, AFAIU last OR has all information about me? Isn't it disclosure of
I think that it would be better if TorButton changes or deletes
HTTP-headers that could disclose me.
For example, at least TorButton could hide my Host header, by it
doesn't.. Is it a bug or what?
