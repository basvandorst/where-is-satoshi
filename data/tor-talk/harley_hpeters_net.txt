Do these settings actually work ?
I ask this because i am running a low bandwith 20 KB server and it is saturating the connection which is currently 32 KB will be increased to 64 KB soon.
I have tested the connection and it is able to deliver the full 32 KB.
In the torrc config file i have tried both:
BandwidthRate 20 KB and
BandwidthRate 20000 and they seem to do nothing.
Tor is saturating the connection so bad that the ntp time server on the
machine can't stay in sync due to not being able to access the internet.
If i can't get these to work i might have to shut down the tor server until i can get qos working on my router.(currently broken).A new firmware is due out soon but soon could be a month.
Also what are you supposed to set BandwithBurst to ?

Ok i have found out that this is due to directory mirroring.
I will have to turn directory mirroring off until i get qos working.

Well i tried 0.1.0.17 and it didn't seem to help me. The problem is when
i turn on directory mirroring i get so many directory requests that it saturates the connection. And since bandwidthrate doesn't check the out bound traffic which is what directory traffic mainly is it just uses all the bandwidth the connection has. The rest of the tor traffic hasn't been anywhere near the the bandwidth limit i have set.

Yes i set the BandwidthBurst to 20 KB as well. But it didn't seem to help.
It's saturating the upload (outbound) side of my connection which is currently 32KB.

I should also point out that i server the dircetory request via apache2 proxy_mod. And according to it's logs the tor server never refused a directory request.

Ok i moved it to 9030 without apache involved and it does appear to be working better.
Need to test longer to be sure.
