@_subject: tor client over HTTP or SSH port forwarding ? 
Oh, so THAT's why FascistFirewall didn't work when I tried it today. Another issue is that the directory needs to be served on port 80 or 443 so the oppressed nodes can get it.

@_subject: (FWD) Tor, Socks bind, and BitTorrent 
Since the tracker protocol is just HTTP, it's the latter.
This isn't strictly necessary, since BT peers don't *have* to accept incoming connections at all. A peer that only makes outgoing connections can still participate in the BT swarm, and that model should work with Tor easily.
This leaves the problem that the peers who *do* listen for connections are exposed.

Google Talk probably won't work over Tor since it probably uses UDP.

@_subject: reconsidering default exit policy 
I can't imagine why a kernel would rewrite destination addresses that way, but it doesn't matter since the kernel sees the packets after they come out of Tor. But I could imagine a case where the DNS resolver returns 127.0.0.1 when a machine looks up its own hostname (even though that doesn't sound like it should happen either).

Sure, but as I said, a 127.0.0.0/8 exit policy won't affect that Wes Felter - wesley at felter.org -

@_subject: a solution on the horizon to counteract detecting temperature 
It's not clear to me that this would help. Power analysis is not the same thing as temperature-induced clock skew. AFAIK, temperature-induced fluctuations would actually be worse in asynchronous logic, although I think it would appear as performance fluctuation, not clock skew. Also, mainstream processors will not adopt asynchronous logic within the next decade, if ever.
