@_subject: [tor-talk] Firefox DNS leak? 
This is a well-known issue in the security community. You need to go to about:config and set network.proxy.socks_remote_dns to true
This is one reason why people recommend the Tor Browser Bundle. It has this feature set.

Hi Mike,
I'm writing a blog post about web of trust. I'm looking for any weaknesses I can find in it because I'm writing a piece of software that would be designed to help grow it. I'd appreciate if you could give me a few points that I can research. I'd be happy to send you my findings so far if you want to read them. This is a fairly important subject because many people rely upon it for software signing, encrypted e-mail, and soon we could use it much more widely.
I've read the previous thread about web of trust (tor-talk 2010 December) but didn't find it to be particularly relevant.
