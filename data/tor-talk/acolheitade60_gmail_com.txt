@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Issue 
My name is Jo?o and I'm in need of guidance with an issue with Tor Browser.
I tried to install it and reinstall it about 5 times now. As soon as I try
to run Tor it opens a window with 2 options "Connect" and "Configure". I
can click on both but that window will crash with no error message nor any
information about the issue.
Sometimes that window doesn't even open, other times I don't get a chance
to click the options.
I have no anti-virus other than Windows defender and I looked online for
answers and found none corresponding to this issue.
Thank you for your attention to this matter,
