Thanks for your quick reply. Tor v0.1.2.13. compiled from source, openssl 0.9.8a
from standard ubuntu distro dapper LTS.
Have been running tor server for several months on
relatively old hardware (Pentium II type). All works
well, but have already seen this warning when running
As said, the server has been running well and
continues to do so. :-) Just curious about the warning
and whether some steps are necessary. Cheers, Sam       ___________________________________________________________ Yahoo! Mail is the world's favourite email. Don't settle for less, sign up for
