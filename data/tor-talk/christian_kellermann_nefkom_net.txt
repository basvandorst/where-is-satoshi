@_subject: Using TOR? get lost! 
* vukki starborn  [060407 09:43]:
This is happening on some IRC networks out there (namely quakenet)
The list of running tor servers is publically accessible just as for
tor clients/servers.
Not on that particular network I am afraid.

That security by obscurity approach won't work. If someone trys to
attack the tor network we should assume that this person knows what
he/she is doing. So keeping the test method a secret will hinder the
good guys from making sure that this old attack does not persist any
In my opinion this also goes for any check at the directory server
level. Checks will get implemented, worked around, refined, etc...
So one should not believe that just implementing one cure for an
attack will make your system secure forever. Mike's investigation
just pointed out that the "race" is already "on". Most of the people
on this list may already know this, but I felt like pointing this
out again at this point in the conversation.
Best regards,

Oh, I've misunderstood your point then. Apologies for that.
I still don't see the difference of this approach compared to the
usual implementation cycle with tor. Maybe there is none after all?
As soon as you implement checks in tor, people will know what to
look out for. I assumed that you indeed do some testing before
incorporating such tests.
In this thread's case, saying "I've found some way to detect man in the
middle attacks" won't make an attacker more alert than a svn checkin
message, would it?
I am sure we both agree, that it is always better to test a method
before publishing it, avoiding confusion about what is possible and
what is just bla bla...
Thanks for clearing things up,

I have had the same problem. This has been fixed in CVS and also
backported to the stable branch. Which version are you using?

* Tor User  [060118 13:41]:
I don't think this is related to tor. It seems someone harvested
your email address from the status page and send you some garbage. I
have seen this form of spam as a part of a multipart message where
the plain text is used to confuse Bayes filters.
Maybe the spammer misconfigured his tool.
Why would anyone send just a couple words? Because they can I

@_subject: False certificates 
* xiando  [061124 10:56]:
This is the same issue with the rest of the internet. You
need to check your certificate on every connection attempt wether
through Tor or not.
Moral issues aside, this is not more outrageous than other
misbehaving routers on the internet. What do you want to
investigate? Some tor operators sniff traffic and say so openly. If
you don't feel right about this exclude those nodes from your
Some people on this list have been discussing an automated check for
such things. I cannot remember the outcome though. Archives will
