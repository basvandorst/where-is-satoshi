I'd like to explore the possibility of hosting the Wikispooks site as
a Hidden service.
I have hosted and webmastered the site through its development on
vps's since 2010. The nature of its content has caused me to
familiarise myself with web anonymity to some extent but I am no
serious techie in the technologies that seek to enable it.
Whilst Wikispooks is no Facebook or Wikipedia, I can think of many
categories of people who would value true end-to-end anonymity in
accessing some of its content - I'm thinking derivatives of the
Wikileaks diplomatic cable leaks, the Snowden documents and other
items whose classification status has become moot.
My preference would be that neither the DOS file content nor the Mysql
database be duplicated but that the Hidden service act as a sort of
proxy to everything that is already there.
Is that a realistic prospect?
Any observations/suggestions most welcome.

I'd say that was a blinkered view of the potential usage of hidden
services. The case cited is one where both parties require anonymity,
the most widely known examples being the 'illegal markets', but there
are at least two other cases:
1. HS provider requires anonymity - eg a publisher of classified or
otherwise forbidden information that needs to avoid the attentions of
those who would suppress such info.
2. HS client requires anonymity - A striking example being US government
employees who want to peruse (for example) the Wikileaks cables but who
run serious risks with career if they do so without solid end-to-end
anonymity and content encryption.
I am currently experimenting with case 2 on a Thomas White-provided HS.
Wikispooks does not seek anonymity, but there are many groups of people
who cannot risk accessing the site regularly unless their anonymity is
well assured. My intent is to remove the risk of a compromised exit node
by providing a tunnel from the HS to the main site - and various other
gizmos as and when experience indicates.

Maybe I was not clear. I'm not arguing against dual-anonymity (ie HS
provider and client). I agree it is good to have available. But that
does not and should not exclude the other two cases I described.
IMO case 2 represents a large untapped potential user pool for Tor.

Does that include 'wackos' from Ireland too? or does geographical
location not really matter?
We have Mr Bean over here too. Look him up:
