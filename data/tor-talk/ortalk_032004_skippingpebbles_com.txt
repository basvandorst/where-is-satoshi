eMacs are/were Apple's olive branch to the education community when the redesigned the iMac and increased its price.  Up until recent months they were the least costly & slowest systems (which can still run circles around my older than dirt Pentium II that still serves me faithfully).  eMac have/had the same design as the original iMac where the CRT and part of the system.
I purchased an eMac for a project (eventually fell through) because few places will lease an Apple system in Central Ohio (most leasing companies didn't know what an "Apple" was...) and those that do lease them think you should pay several hundred dollars per week.  I opted to purchase one rather than flush 75% of the purchase price on leasing a system for a week or so.
I don't think hardware is a problem as I have used it regularly for web browsing, watching video clips, etc. but I will run the diagnostics that someone shared to verify.  I did wipe the system clean and reload/repatch it and the same issue occurs so I am pretty sure the software is okay as well.

I am curious what platform you are using and how long your time line is for this problem to appear???

I updated to 10.3.9 today and in less than 5 hours the system is dead as before.  I have *not *tested the hardware from the CD/DVDs as suggested yet (they seem to be hiding from me this evening).

Ran the diagnostics successfully without any reported defects.
Someone else with a Mac (G5) said they have not had any issues running Tor as a server and speculated that maybe it was a G4 problem (processor) so I would be curious if those who have seen the same issue also have a G4 system?

@_subject: Accounting and Hibernation Features 
I am a bit confused...the documentation that was installed with Tor says to see the FAQ for details on these features, but the FAQ says to see the Tor documentation for details.  Kinda like a who's on first and I don't know is on second...with each document referring you to the other document.  Is there a way to search the mailing list for any posts that would be helpful?

Aha!  As a Windows weenie that would never have occurred to me (I am working towards leaving the platform)! :-)   I was able to use google with this tip and found a man page on the Tor web site that documents everything.  Thanks!

@_subject: (FWD) OS/X Installer 
The installer appears to have been built from a client only perspective (which is what 99% of people need).  The commands I was using to try to see what application was running on the ports (as well as the ps commands) did not show Tor running, but it had to have been operator error. :-)   I confirmed with a a GUI tool (Activity Monitor, included in OS/X) that both Tor and Privoxy were running on the system so that confirms why I could not bring up an instance that had been configured as a server.
I was greatly confused by how the installer does it's thing on OS/X as some of its behavior didn't seem to follow what the torrc file suggested.  Using the OS/X installer things are scattered all over the place and you have to enable the root user to get at certain files/directories.  Part of the confusion is a lack of understanding what is supposed to go where on OS/X, but with Windows the program is under Program Files and data is under the Application Data directory so it is much simpler.  I wish that the default location for everything (torrc, fingerprint, keys, logs, etc.) was in the same folder (or a subfolder) wherever the tor binary is located no matter what platform.

I configured hibernation while I work towards moving the server to another system, but as of 8:00AM local time (13:00 GMT according to  Tor is still hibernating.  Based on the messages on the console I thought Tor would have awakened at 12:34 AM local time? (.9.6 version of Tor)

I misspoke a moment ago...I am still running .9.5 on the Win32 system.

@_subject: Tor 0.1.0.1-rc - Problems with included torrc 
The included torrc file that is included with this build is not readily editable on the Win32 platform.  It's like the "end of line" characters that Windows platforms use are missing.
