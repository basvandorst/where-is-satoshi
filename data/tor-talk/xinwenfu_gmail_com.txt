@_subject: Location privacy preserving location based service with Tor 
Dear All,
We integrated Tor with a location based service to implement a location
privacy preserving location based service.
1. Tor is used to hide the identity (IP) of a user, who sends her location
to a location based service server for points of interest. Hiding IP is also
necessary for hiding the user location since IP may imply the user's
2. Of course, the user's location coordinates are also perturbed to hide her
exact location.
Here is the link of the software:
 The paper is here:
Happy new year!

The problem is: was the violation done through Tor? A bot may do the same
thing. Time to scan your computer?:) Maybe you can run Tor as an entry or a
middle node, not an exit node.

@_subject: Timing attacks from a user's point of view 
I guess the approach will not be quite useful.
1. Delay is a big enemy of Tor. Read
 How much delay is a
problem too.
2. An attack can be dynamic against your mechanism by varying the parameters
of the attack. We already tested the impact of using various batching and
reordering on attacks. Read
 Basically, it is of not
much use.
3. Many people still talk about reordering. Reordering cannot be used for
TCP at all. It kills the performance. Read

@_subject: Timing attacks from a user's point of view 
Most timing attacks require global adversary like a government or ISP since
the attacker wants to find out two parties communicating with each other.
Our attacks have that constraint.
For parameters of the attack in 2, the paper has Lemma 1 for that. That is,
the signal to noise ratio affects the attack result. The random noise you
introduce is one type of noise. We did not enumerate the parameter selection
for different cases. We have some study of introducing noise in a different
context: Hope it helps a bit.

We have implemented the http and email bots, which are working well without
much human labor work.
I'd recommend CATCHA to be implemented on the bridge http server. The email
server should have at least a challenge-response mechanism. However, this
challenge-response mechanism helps only a little bit. Maybe we should not
have the email distribution mechanism if decent CATCHA is used on the http

Sorry. Here is a clarification: our http and email bots "worked" well. We
have stopped those bots for quite a while and have no plan to make them run
again. I also realized email distribution is necessary for some people. So a
challenge-response mechanism can be necessary too against bots. However, the
challenge-response mechanism should be able to tell bots from humans.
Otherwise, the bots can still send email, read email and analyze the email
for bridges.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Legal or not on monitoring traffic at a Tor exit? 
I'm a bit curious about the legal issue on monitoring traffic at a Tor exit?
Is monitoring Tor traffic at an exit legal? Since the traffic passes "my"
computer, seems of course I can monitor it or even change it. When people
set up a Tor exit, is there any policy from Tor governing the behavior of
the operators? Is there any legal liability?

I'm just asking the legal liability of running Tor exits and making it
clear. I don't bother with modifying somebody's traffic.
Basically, you are saying once we run exits, the computers are not our own
computers any more:
Tor exit operators == ISP, from the perspective of laws.
What if somebody attacks my computer running a Tor exit via Tor? I have to
call police since I cannot check the content of the attack traffic?

An attack may only work under its own threat model (capabilities and
resources an adversary has). If entries and exit are all secure, some
correlation attacks may not work. However, if the adversary can still
observe (not need to compromise Tor routers) the traffic into and out of
entries and exits, some attacks may still work, e.g., by correlating the
traffic patterns at the two sides of a circuit. Here is a paper describing
such possibility:
Hope it helps a bit.

That is a lot of thinking. Many of the problems have been discussed before.
If you look at the bibliography on mixes, there are a lot of discussions.
Here is one of my papers on mixes:
 An adversary may
choose different ways for correlation and attacks.
What Tor achieves is phenomenal. It works against many attacks. Tor
performance has been improving. I'm saying this because a workable system
is not easy. For example, changing packet orders may not be a good idea. It
may not help much on security, but will deteriorate the TCP performance Tor
relies on. TCP is very sensitive to packet ordering errors.
Indeed, there are still a lot of things we don't know for sure. However, at
least Tor is over there and you can test it on the real one or a private

Hi Chris,
Are you going to do the reordering link-by-link or end-to-end? TCP over TCP
is believed a good idea in terms of performance. Also what is the benefit
for privacy enhancing if the client itself reorders everything back? What
is the performance overhead?
Tor is, I believe, a result after considering many possible options,
including mixes. It evolves from mixes. Mixes use buffer and shuffling in
various ways.
Traffic padding is also an old topic. Tor has an option of using padding. I
actually did a lot of study on this. The major trouble is the overhead.
Another question is how you set the overall rate of the padded traffic? You
can refer to early papers on padding by my group and Matthew Wright at UT

The problem is what attacks you want to fight against. What is your threat
model? Correlation can be done via different features of a traffic flow.
TCP and Tor protocols try to make the traffic rate stable from the sender
to the receiver. At least, this is the result of these protocols.
Therefore, the rate of a traffic flow into Tor and out of Tor should be
similar, at least more similar to each other than to other traffic flows.
Therefore, traffic rate can be used for correlating flows. Then your
strategy may not work. Many of my papers are on using traffic rate as
features correlating flows. You can refer to them.
Hope it helps a bit.
