Provided your VPN does not disconnect and works fine, it will appear
the exit is located at the VPN's IP address.

I've been following the recent developments in the EU enquiry into mass
surveillance. Naturally, I tried to load "europa.eu" but I was told
"access denied. Denied for security reason".
Was I blocked for using Tor? Considering the efforts by Tor team
members and testimonies, is there any way to contact the EU sysadmins?

I've emailed the contacts listed at  results for
"europa.eu" after your suggestion. Thanks.
With any luck, the situation will be resolved swiftly! :)

By "sysadmins", I meant the guys who manage the EU site for the EU aka
techs, I don't want to involve the ISP. I guess I was unclear..
Ha. I got the error on the same URL too. .eu's WHOIS register gave me
some non-ISPs emails which I have sent a nice email to asking for some
help on the matter. If I see no response via email after a reasonable
period, I'll try the form you linked one way or another.
Thank you for the link!

Fantastic.. sounds like it's working. You may wish to post the log
stating this to verify.
DirPort is not required to be a relay in the network. I'm unsure about
Exit but my guess is that Exits do not require you to be a
"V2Dir" (directory mirror) as it doesn't make much sense to force that.
If you are able to host a DirPort in addition to a relay/exit, go
ahead! You are still tremendously useful and contributing even without
a DirPort.

Woo-hoo! Check out  Search for your
relay's Nickname (if you set one) or the fingerprint/IP and you will be
given its statistics, flags, etc. It's great. Beware, it may take some
hours to update.
Awesome. Thank you. :)

This gives some insight.. maybe it's not hopeless. It does raise
questions as to why they banned it in the first place (and now) though.
No response as of yet but I remain optimistic.
