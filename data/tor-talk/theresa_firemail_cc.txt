@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB as main browser: persistent logins to trusted sites? 
Dear Tor community,
I'm exploring using TBB as my main browser.
However, there's one thing that I'd like to find a solution to - namely being able to use "New Identity" while having a white list of domains where "New Identity" would not erase cookies.
In other words, I'd like to be able to look like a new user to 99,99% of the Internet, while still retain session cookies of 3-5 trusted domains.
I've noticed that there's a Cookie Protections dialog if the "private" browsing mode is disabled (yeah, I know it's risky to change that - but I'm just researching options), and within it one can clear all cookies except "protected" ones - that seemed to be quite close to what I'd However, I have noticed that if "private" browsing mode is disabled, "New Identity" doesn't actually clear any cookies anymore. It seems to depend on "private" browsing mode being enabled in TBB to clear cookies.
So, do you use TBB as your main browser, and if so, what approach(es) do you take regarding "trusted" sites? Do you relogin each time you do a New Identity?

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor-talk Digest, Vol 82, Issue 10 
Dear Duncan,
Thank you for your suggestion. In fact, I use KeePassX already:)
Regarding fingerprints - if I was able to somehow clear all cookies and persistent data _except session cookies for these 2-5 domains_ (rotating exit node is fine), how is that worse in terms of privacy than logging-in to the same domains back immediately after clicking "New Identity"? The result is practically the same, isn't it? I'm still identifying myself to these few domains on the same terms as before - no more info, no less. Or am I wrong?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser safe window width cap 
Currently, the Tor Browser design document [1] mentions that the window
size for new windows is capped at 1000 px in each direction:
I am wondering if the maximum safe width of a TBB window should be
increased to 1200 px at some point. Currently, majority of desktop
screen sizes seem to be 1200+:
This would make people with screen resolutions like 1024x768 stand out,
but may hopefully make those who are on 1200+ use the default size more
often and maximize/resize less.
What do others think?

@_subject: [tor-talk] torsocks dont find curl program 
As a side note, curl supports socks5 proxies, so you could create an alias, say turl:
alias turl='curl --proxy socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050/' # in ~/.bashrc
And then just use turl whenever you need to curl through tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] CloudFlare captchas disappeared? 
Recently I've realized that I'm not seeing the CloudFlare capchas anymore in TBB, or seeing them far less often.
Is it just me, or they have really changed something about their

@_subject: [tor-talk] CloudFlare captchas disappeared? 
That is interesting. Are there any public sources on this with more technical details?
I'd like to understand what exactly has changed.
Actually, I think that if the change they did makes sense technically (at least it has a good effect), we can probably use that as a positive example to show to other CDNs / hosting providers / etc.
Maybe a blog post about this in the tor project's blog would even make Because there's a lot of discussion about how bad CloudFlare was with the captchas, but not really anything that I could find easily about positive changes they did.
I think it's important to highlight improvements when they happen.
