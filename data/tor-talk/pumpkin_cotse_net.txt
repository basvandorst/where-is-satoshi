@_subject: Polipo and dnsUseGethostbyname - what is the best option and does 
The standard Polipo configuration file for Ubuntu located at  should replace the configuration file one downloads when Polipo is installed according to The Polipo configuration from  # Uncomment this to disable Polipo's DNS resolver and use the system's
# default resolver instead. If you do that, Polipo will freeze during
# every DNS query:
dnsUseGethostbyname = yes
However, section 3.9 of the Polipo manual says:
Polipo usually tries to speak the DNS protocol itself rather than using the system re-
solver5 . Its precise behaviour is controlled by the value of dnsUseGethostbyname. If
dnsUseGethostbyname is false, Polipo never uses the system resolver. If it is reluctantly
(the default), Polipo tries to speak DNS and falls back to the system resolver if a name server
could not be contacted. If it is happily, Polipo tries to speak DNS, and falls back to the system
resolver if the host couldn?t be found for any reason (this is not a good idea for shared proxies).
Finally, if dnsUseGethostbyname is true, Polipo never tries to speak DNS itself and uses the
system resolver straight away (this is not recommended).
Three questions:
First, since "yes" is not one of the four options listed in 3.9 what does this mean? I was using "yes" for many months without realizing it was not an option. How does Polipo use "yes"? Why is this in the config Second, surely the best option is "false". That way even if there is a problem with Polipo's DNS it will not use the local DNS as listed in resolv.conf. Some people might say: put OpenDNS in resolv.conf. However, I am on an academic network which does not permit me to modify the DNS; changing resolv.conf means I have no connection. (I know about the dnsNameServer option but let's leave that for now).
Third, I always use Polipo with Tor. Even if dnsUseGethostbyname is set to "yes" or any of the four valid options does this matter? Are DNS requests passed through Polipo to Tor and then Tor does its DNS resolution (after the final exit node if I understand correctly?) so this setting in the configuration file is not important? Or does Polipo do the DNS resolution before traffic is passed on to Tor in which case the configuration file is crucial? In other words, when is DNS resolved when using Tor and Polipo?

@_subject: Polipo and dnsUseGethostbyname - what is the best option and 
Thank you for the confirmation.
So, the option "reluctantly" for dnsUseGethostbyname would mean DNS requests are done by Tor and are only done by Polipo if Tor DNS fails or does it mean DNS requests are now done by Polipo usually and only done by the system resolver if Polipo DNS fails?
The manual says for "reluctantly" - "Polipo tries to speak DNS and falls back to the system resolver if a name server
could not be contacted."  I am unclear where it tries to speak DNS - would this be before Tor or would the DNS still get pushed through Tor even though the configuration file has been modified?
I am still confused regarding what "yes" actually means - does it refer to the default which is "reluctantly" or does it mean nothing to Polipo and is just ignored?  In which case why not just comment this option out?
Thank you for your help!

But if you change it to "false" would that not be the safest option - from what I can gather in this situation Polipo would never do its own DNS.

@_subject: Polipo and dnsUseGethostbyname - what is the best option and 
I'm not sure whether either of these bugs are fixed at present (ugh). So
I'd recommend sticking with yes (or true, I guess it's called now).
If "yes" is the same as "true" then this is a setting the Polipo manual
strongly advises against. "Finally, if dnsUseGethostbyname is true,
Polipo never tries to speak DNS itself and uses the system resolver straight away (this is not recommended)."
----- Given those, and since polipo shouldn't be doing any dns resolves anyway
when it's using a socks5 proxy, I figured I'd go for the choice that
exposed less surface area.
My fundamental question is this:
If the config file says "yes" to dnsUseGethostbyname then Tor does the DNS resolution.
If however the config file says something else e.g. "reluctantly" (The manual says "if it is reluctantly
(the default), Polipo tries to speak DNS and falls back to the system resolver if a name server
could not be contacted.") then does Polipo do its own DNS resolution and then pass this on to Tor therefore leaking?
Or, are you saying, that "since polipo shouldn't be doing any dns resolves anyway when it's using a socks5 proxy" the value of dnsUseGethostbyname is not relevant when using Polipo with Tor since Tor will ALWAYS do DNS resolution because of socksParentProxy = "localhost:9050" and socksProxyType = socks5.
If yes then my first question is moot.
This is what is confusing me the most - whether changing dnsUseGethostbyname means Polipo (not Tor) now does the DNS resolution.

Hello,
I don't understand this.
I go to  and have a look at the exit node "gigatux" called emohawk2.gigatux.com and located at 78.129.201.189.
This appears to be located in the UK according to blutmagie.de.
When I go to  it tells me:
IP Address 	: 	78.129.201.189
Location 	: 	UNITED KINGDOM,
Latitude / Longitude 	: 	54.15 LATITUDE, -4.473 LONGITUDE

However, when I log into Gmail and click the "details" button which provides me with the "Activity Information" I am informed that:
This computer is using IP address 78.129.201.189. (United States (MA)
This is not the first time I have seen Gmail (Google Mail) claim an exit node is from a location which exit node websites (like blutmagie.de) disagree.  Why in this case, for example, is Gmail claiming the exit node IP is in the USA rather than the UK?

@_subject: PayPal is not the only organization that blocks Tor. 
It is also worth noting that Craigslist prevents the use of Tor albeit in a very strange way.
If you try to post using Tor the ad will be permitted at first and people can contact you.  However, after about 15 minutes (and it is always about 15 minutes) the post is "flagged" and disappears.  This happens even if the exit node is in the same location as the section where you are trying to place the ad e.g. using a Californian exit server and the ad is something to do with California.
I can understand that every day or week the Craigslist system has a look at the Tor exit nodes directory and therefore can identify Tor nodes.
What I fail to understand is why the Craigslist policy is to permit the posting then "flag" it after 15 minutes or so?  Is this automatic?  Is it human?  I find it bizarre.  What might be the reasons?

@_subject: The team of PayPal is a band of pigs and cads! 
There are two different issues here: privacy and anonymity.
In terms of privacy (shielding your content from your ISP for example), the danger with using Tor without SSL is that the exit node can sniff your traffic (as can your ISP or any router between you and your destination unless you use SSL  - this is, of course, when you are not using Tor) and the exit node can also inject malicious content.  The solution is to use Tor with SSL.  Go to  when using Tor and it will ask you to use its SSL service because, as it says, an exit node can potentially sniff your traffic.  When using Scroogle with its SSL service, any exit nodes cannot sniff or inject because even though the content is decrypted by the exit node (which is essential since the exit node needs to provide your request to the destination website in a manner than the website can understand), the content is still SSL'd (until it is un-SSL'd at the final The other point of using Tor is to achieve anonymity.  By hiding your real IP you can log into sites without compromising who you are based on your static or NAT'd IP.
In his specific case, however, the anonymity issue would probably be a moot point if he is logging into his actual PayPal account, and therefore I suspect he simply wants to use Tor on principle.

On numerous occasions when using Google with Tor (yes, I know there are other options like Scroogle) it claims I might be sending automated queries and gives me a CAPTCHA.  Sometimes this allows me to search; other times I am caught in a loop and am constantly send back to the CAPTCHA screen.
I am wondering why Google does not deal with this.  I can understand that if dozens of people are using the same IP then some sites think "zombies" are being used.  But if the IP is a Tor node then this is not the case.  Google could surely exclude these Tor IPs.
So my question is: why don't they?  What are the politics behind their decision not to acknowledge Tor exit nodes as bona fide?

I had not read this article before but I had read EPIC's analysis of flash cookies: I had also read the scholarly article here: None of these three articles mention IP addresses.  Am I to assume that it is a given that the flash component of Gmail will automatically grab the IP address (when connecting in a non-Tor state) and then connect that IP to the IP addresses that connected in a Tor state through the flash cookie (providing flash is on when connecting in a Tor state).
In other words do you think IP addresses are not mentioned in these articles because a) it is taken as a given that the flash cookie is used to determine the "real" IP or b) because it is not actually guaranteed that IP addresses will be connected through flash cookies?

Are you sure that JavaScript can give away your IP?  Flash can - but my understanding is that JavaScript cannot.
As another poster noted though: JS is great for providing browser and system information such as the local time zone.
Three suggestions:
a) Use Tor with TorButton and NoScript which will deal with your Flash / JavaScript issues.  It is impractical to turn JavaScript off and a few sites like YouTube demand Flash.
b) Make sure you wipe your cache and your Flash Cookies.  Are you using Windows or Linux?  For Ubuntu you need to wipe the .adobe and .macromedia c) Why not use Tor with a commercial VPN.  The VPN (providing it does DNS resolution) will route all traffic and then you can use specific applications like Firefox or Pidgin to work with Tor.

It will depend on whether you are using Tor (or, for example, a VPN).
If you are using Tor then look at the Message Log (in Vidalia).  It will warn you if there is leakage based on your websurfing.  If you have set-up Tor properly in Firefox the proxy settings box the you should have no problems.  Along with using NoScript and TorButton to prevent Flash problems (as you previously mentioned).
If you are using a VPN then try "nslookup"   For example nslookup yahoo.com Server:        80.254.79.157
Address:    80.254.79.157
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    yahoo.com
Address: 209.191.122.70
Where 80.254.79.157 is my VPN's DNS IP (rather than my ISP's DNS IP or 192.168.2.1 if you are using NAT).

@_subject: Tor and DNS. 
Hello,
This is, I am sure, a simple Tor-DNS question, but I would appreciate it if someone could confirm my understanding of how this system works.
Normally (without Tor) when someone requests a website the URL has to be converted into the IP address.  Therefore, a) the user's cache is checked for this connection between URL and IP b) if the cache does not have the IP then the ISP's DNS is checked c) and if the ISP's DNS does not have the IP then the ISP's DNS requests it from the DNS server where the domain is registered which then directs the user to the hosting location.
However, with Tor and Polipo, then DNS request is routed through Polipo then through Tor's three nodes then the final exit node does the DNS resolution with the DNS server where the domain is registered (bypassing the local cache and ISP).
I ask because I have a direct internet connection (no NAT) and do not own my network.  Therefore, I cannot change the DNS settings in resolv.conf (to OpenDNS for example), nor can I use a VPN (which also requires changing DNS settings).   However, Tor does work and the message log does not show any I just want to confirm that Tor and Polipo are, in fact, bypassing my ISP's DNS, and that what I have written above (however ineptly) seems correct.

@_subject: Torbutton Documentation - Adversary Capabilities. 
Hello,
I have been reading the Torbutton documentation (thanks, guys) and have a question about the adversary capabilities.
The first adversary capability is "inserting javascript".  The document says that "If not properly disabled, Javascript event handlers and timers can cause the browser to perform network activity after Tor has been disabled, thus allowing the adversary to correlate Tor and Non-Tor activity and reveal a user's non-Tor IP address."
The third adversary capability is "inserting CSS".  The document says that "CSS can also be used to correlate Tor and Non-Tor activity and reveal a user's Non-Tor IP address, via the usage of CSS popups - essentially CSS-based event handlers that fetch content via CSS's onmouseover attribute. If these popups are allowed to perform network activity in a different Tor state than they were loaded in, they can easily correlate Tor and Non-Tor activity and reveal a user's IP address."
I understand that Torbutton is useful for protecting privacy in multiple ways.  But I would like to address this specific issue if I may.
Let us imagine that a user surfs the net using Tor (and Polipo or Privoxy).  He has JavaScript installed and uses it for all sites.  He finishes his activities and then closes his browser.  He then wipes the following files and directories (I am using Ubuntu as my example):
Now I assume that these Javascript events and handlers and the CSS handlers were downloaded into the Cache from when the user was browsing using Tor.  They would then be deleted as detailed above. Therefore, when the user loads up Firefox and turns off the Tor proxy settings, presumably the potential for JavaScript or CSS to connect Tor and non-Tor activity and get the users real (non-Tor) IP address is no longer a concern?
Is this correct?  Or am I missing something?  Just to re-state: I am only looking at this one issue - I am well aware of how useful Tor button is in other areas!

Apologies in advance for the basic-ness of this question.   I cannot
find the answer with Google or in the Tor documentation.
When you connect to a website using HTTP or HTTP/S and you want to
download a file (like a .doc or .exe) then Firefox asks you where on the
hard drive the file should be saved, you decide the location, and the
file downloads.
In these cases, how is the file downloaded?  Does the download happen
through HTTP/S?  If I am using Polipo and Tor then I assume the file is
downloaded as HTTP/S and goes through the Tor nodes like any "normal"
HTTP/S traffic.
In other words, can someone confirm that each attachment is not
downloaded in a way that is "outside" the Tor nodes?

This is especially dangerous if you are using Yahoo Mail, because evenif you trust the person who sent you the document, your attachment will be downloaded in plaintext (via http, not https). This means that the exit node you use can replace or alter your document to unmask you (or worse, exploit your document reader and run arbitrary code).
I am curious to know if there is a way of identifying "bad" exit nodes?  Do people who are more technical than me (not hard!) somehow search for exit nodes with interesting configurations?  Or, unless you use StrictExitNodes and are confident of the honesty of the operator, are you simply hoping the exit node owner is benign?

@_subject: SOCKS 4a or SOCKS 5 when using Polipo? 
Hello,
According to the Tor manual ( one should use SOCKS 4a.
AIUI, Polipo or Privoxy are used as HTTP proxies which then allow the client (Firefox) to "speak" to Tor as SOCKS 4a (therefore providing hostnames rather than already resolved IP addresses as with SOCKS 4 or 5).
I therefore do not understand why in the Tor version of the Polipo configuration file ( it says:
# Uncomment this if you want to use a parent SOCKS proxy:
socksParentProxy = "localhost:9050"
socksProxyType = socks5
I am going to assume that the need to use a HTTP proxy no longer exists and Firefox used as a SOCKS 5 client allows Tor to do DNS resolutions remotely?  Could someone please explain or confirm this?
Many thanks.

---I have no idea what this means. I thought the whole point of using https:// was to prevent Tor exit nodes from snooping and / or potentially injecting content.
"This applies especially to websites like the reasonably anonymous whistleblowing website _wikileaks.org _ (based in Sweden) , which offer both  https:/and Tor Hidden Service methods of uploading whistleblower leak documents, but who tend to, mistakenly, insist on using https:// encryption for when someone comments on their wiki discussion pages. When (not if) the wikileaks.org servers, or a blog or a discussion forum like the activist news site _Indymedia UK _ are physically seized (this happened to IndyMedia UK at least 3 times now) , this may, in some circumstances, betray the real IP addresses of commentators with inside knowledge of a whistleblower leak i.e. suspects for a leak investigation."

Hello,
I have yet another question that relates to the effectiveness of Tor.
Gmail (and therefore presumably other webmail operators) knows my computer's time zone.  It does not know the time per se but the "time zone" as set (in Ubuntu) through clicking on the clock, selecting preferences, then choosing location.
Obviously this ignores the time (based on the location) of the Tor exit node.
I do not know how Gmail knows my computer's time zone, and, in which case, what other "local" information it can know.
Does anyone know how Gmail can do this and what other information from the client computer can be viewed.  In other words, why can Gmail not, in theory, also view the real local IP?

AIUI, Gmail uses JavaScript to detect the time zone (but not the time) on the client machine.  When I use NoScript with Gmail as untrusted, Gmail cannot use JavaScript.  Changing the time zone settings (for example to something five hours behind my real time zone) does not then change the time at which e-mail appears to arrive in the Gmail inbox since this requires JavaScript which is not used since Gmail is considered untrusted.
However, since many websites do require JavaScript, whether or not one is using NoScript and / or TorButton, my question was:
If Gmail can get the time zone via JavaScript (when the client is using Tor) then why can it not get the "real" IP also via JavaScript (when the client is using Tor)?  I don't think it can get the real IP since I have used various tests including  and Tor with JavaScript does not reveal the real IP.  But why not?

However, going to ( results in a "not found" error.
In fact it would appear this is a problem with Mozilla:  and nothing to do with the developer.
The developer, Netticat, writes in this thread:
This BetterPrivacy bug is triggered ...
- either by Firefox add-ons which prevent cookie deletion for legal reasons (e.g. Beef Taco)
- or by badly coded web-pages (still opened while quitting the browser).
To fix the issue immediately please choose from the following options:
- install the new BetterPrivacy version 1.66 which can be found here
- keep the previous BetterPrivacy version 1.65, but choose another LSO deletion option than on FireFox exit
- temporarily disable BetterPrivacy 1.65  (until automatically updated)
- disable other possibly conflicting add-ons (yet known: Beef Taco), on FF exit make sure that most web-page tabs are closed
So if you do not want to use 1.66 then you can modify the options in 1.65 to "delete Flash cookies on application start" for example rather than on Firefox exit.

The only about:config entry about Twitter is extensions.https_everywhere.Twitter which is presumably irrelevant if I have removed HTTPS-Everywhere.
Can anyone suggest what modifications are needed to achieve a workaround or if what I am trying to do is not viable.

@_subject: How to use Google Gadgets with Tor? - Is this possible? 
Mike - thanks for your advice.
This is not an issue for me.  I do not get a captcha.
I installed this add-on.
I wiped my cache and cookies and used the headers and generator tabs with just Polipo and Tor running (no TorButton, NoScript, etc).
Then I logged into Gmail and waited until everything fully loaded then clicked the Twitter icon and waited until Twitter fully loaded (although as mentioned one does not see the Twitter screen when using Tor).
There were two "warnings" from the headers that looked like this:
Server: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.1.6
Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=crm7nfld6en7aei64tnhmkif72; path=/
Pragma: no-cache
Age: 1
Connection: keep-alive
Warning: 110 localhost:8118 Object is stale
These warnings did not appear in the headers when doing the same action in a non-Tor state.
I can only find this exact text once and it does not refer to Tor:  The HTTP-headers addon generated 120K of text from the "headers" and "generator" tabs simply from attempting to load Twitter with Tor.  Therefore there may well be other content of interest which I did not notice but the two warnings were the most overt.
Any ideas?  Thanks!

Mike - I'm not sure what happened before.  I now am able to use Twitter inside Gmail with Tor, TorButton, and NoScript.
I have to do considerable accepting of various sites to get NoScript to function (since so much is being loaded from non-Gmail locations) but then it works just as if I was using Gmail without any proxies or add-ons.
Thanks for your help!

@_subject: Question and Confirmation. 
I just want to confirm one thing and ask something else.
My understanding is that Tor encrypts both the content of a data packet and also the header.  It encrypts the packet and header three times on the client (my computer) and then at each node one layer is decrypted until the data packet and header are decrypted to plaintext at the final exit node (except when TLS is used).  Right?
The Tor FAQ says "Tor is not illegal anywhere in the world".  Can that really be the case?  What about North Korea for example?  Tor as a specific tool might not be specifically illegal but surely it would fall under the rubric of some kind of stupid prohibition?  Just wondering.

Sorry....I'm not trying to be dumb but I'm unclear how your answer differs from my assumption.
Tor takes all the data (header and content), encrypts it three times on the client (me), and then at each node one layer is unencrypted OR is it all of it unencrypted at the exit node?

I'm still not getting this.  My understanding is that you have the data and the header when using TCP.  If only the data is encrypted then what happens to the headers?

Each relay removes one layer of encryption.
OK.  I get it.  I think.
Please confirm:
The data is encrypted.  The header is not encrypted.
So if my ISP is monitoring my traffic all they see for the header is the connection to the first Tor node.
In which case my question is: where is the information that tells the exit node which DNS resolution to do and therefore which website I am asking for?

@_subject: "Cookie Mismatch" when using Gmail. 
More information appended at the end.
To add some more information:
Vidalia + NoScript does not present any cookie issues.  I can access Account Settings.  The problem is when TorButton is used.
I then used TorButton's preferences to remove all the protections by unticking as much as possible (effectively making TorButton worthless).  I still get the same error!
I rebooted and cleaned the cache and cookies and still I cannot access the Account Settings aspect of Gmail.  It is as if TorButton per se is the issue irrespective of any security settings it uses.
In my Firefox cookie section I have cookies for mail.google.com that read: GX, GXSP, gmailchat, TZ, GMAIL_AT, and S.
Yet Gmail still claims that cookies are not installed.
I did an about:cache and then searched for torbutton.  There were about 100 entries which include:
I did change regen_google cookies to true but this did not change anything.  Perhaps one needs to change certain entries in about:config to affect TorButton's interactions with Gmail?
Any ideas from TorButton developers?  Thanks.

The other idea is perhaps there is a country where Gmail does not verify with SMS?
However, I have just tried a Belarus and an Azeri exit node and SMS verification was required in both cases.

First, did you have to go through SMS verification to open a Gmail account?
Second, I also have had the same problem apropos cookie functionality.   There appears to be no rationale.  I have found that deleting the cache and re-opening Firefox works sometimes but you have to play about with it.
Should you not be using Polipo rather than Privoxy?  Perhaps other people can comment on this?

I assume you are now mentioning there is no need to use Polipo because the SOCKS time-out bug is fixed: And, of course, Torbutton sets network.proxy.socks_remote_dns to true.
What I don't understand is that TorButton seems to create the HTTP and SSL settings in the Connection Settings of Firefox to point to 8118 even if I disable "start a proxy application when Tor starts" (and if I do that then obviously Firefox can't use Tor because it needs Polipo).
So what would be your ideal settings for Firefox Connection Settings and for the Settings of the Vidalia GUI?

I was updated to Firefox 3.6.14 for Ubuntu yesterday (I believe)  Today, when using an American IP, I went to  and began to sign up.  It offered me hotmail.co.uk or live.co.uk addresses.  I live in the UK.  I am using TorButton and NoScript.  Obviously, this concerned me.  I checked my language in Preferences / Content / Languages which showed en-us (rather than en-gb).
Anyhow, it turns out the issue was that when Firefox was updated, the language pack was also updated.  In Add-ons / Languages my language pack was shown as en-GB.  Hence, Hotmail assumed I was in the UK.
This was confirmed by checking about:config with the search term en-GB.
Disabling the language pack and then connecting to Hotmail again after deleting cookies meant Hotmail offered me hotmail.com or live.com.
Hopefully this information will be of use.

Forgive my ignorance but why would there be any need to inspect packets for tunnels?  Would the authorities not just ask every ISP to monitor the IPs to which their clients are connecting and if they are Tor nodes then the client must be reported.  AIUI all the ISP can see is that a connection is made to the first Tor node.
