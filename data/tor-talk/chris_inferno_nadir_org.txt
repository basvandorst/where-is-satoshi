There will be the chaos-communication-camp in August in Germany ( with a 10G uplink. And since this is never really used, I thought it would be a nice Idea to set up some tor-servers there. They will be online only for 4 days but will have quite some bandwidth.
My question is: Does this make sense ? Will the directory-Servers update fast enough to promote these servers ?
Shall I do anything in advance (e.g. register nicknames) ?
Does this help in any way ?

I don't know yet. Since it seems to make sense, I will contact the NOC for the
camp and start planning. I will tell you as soon as I know more.

You have to store the logs in a way, that you can hand them over immediately.
But it is not clear which data to store yet. We will see.
