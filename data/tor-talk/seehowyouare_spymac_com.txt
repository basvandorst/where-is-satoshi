I'm suspecting it's user error -- you, or some program you ran, messed with the directories in a way that made them unsuitable for I am a typical user so I never do anything wrong, I didn't change anything at all (HONEST !)  and your program broke my computer :-)
That said, I will apt-get remove and apt-get install Tor tomorrow and see if the error occurs again.

@_subject: Can't start Tor under Debian 
Hi all, Installed Tor 0.9.6 onto Debian testing and can't get Tor to run.
I followed the thread below as it had exactly the same problem as myself (can't start Tor) but it never came to a successful conclusion and it seems contradictory to uninformed me. Eg: /etc/init.d/tor (as root) is the proper way to start it.
Why create a user called debian-tor if root is supposed to start Tor root at storage:/etc/init.d# apt-get install tor

root at storage:/etc/init.d# socksify lynx This connects but displays my IP address in the EHLO and that means Tor isn't running.
FYI - I have tested Tor on a Windows box here and it's fine.
Is there a wiki we can add this information to for Debian users ?

Thanks for the prompt reply and explanation Roger :-)
root at storage:~# grep 113 /etc/passwd
BTW - ls /var/lib/tor shows an empty folder
I don't know. Is /tor_0.0.9.6-0.woody.1_i386.deb old ?
it probably left its /var/lib/tor/ directory, and then you installed a new one and it's not compatible with what used to be there?
I did install, remove and reinstall using apt-get
I followed the Debian instructions at  I added the sources, did "apt-get install tor"
Tor installed without emitting any error messages but didn't appar to be running
I did an "apt-get remove tor" and then "apt-get install tor"
Since my initla email I have done "dpkg purge tor" followed by "apt-
get install tor" however the issue remains the same with error messages identical to my first post.
 /var/lib/tor is not owned by this UID Couldn't access/create private data directory /var/lib/tor

it probably left its /var/lib/tor/ directory, After "apt-get remove tor" I checked and the /var/lib/tor directory was gone.
It was created again next time I did "apt-get install tor"

Shazaam ! it worked ...thank you. I get a message in the logs warning that my application is leaking DNS requests (or something similar). I'll Google a bit and read up and see if I can solve this.
Is there a wiki that we can add the details of this thread to so other people can get help ?
Thanks for the help
