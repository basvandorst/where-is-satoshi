@_subject: Gentoo's response on them blocking access to their forums via Tor 
Tor network servers banned on the Forums
The Tor Network[7] is an anonymous Internet communication system that uses
a distributed network of servers to bounce communications around. People
were able to use tor to browse the Gentoo Forums[8] until some malicious
users started abusing the forums. As you might have already guessed, using
tor hides your IP address, so it works similarly to a kind of anonymous
posting. The gentoo forums staff[9], due to this abusive use of tor
servers, has decided to ban all tor servers that have an exit policy
allowing connections to forums.gentoo.org on ports 80 (HTTP) and/or 443
(HTTPS). We are concerned that our users might want to preserve their
anonymity, however there doesn't seem to be a good technical or legitimate
reason[10] to use tor on the Gentoo Forums.
  7.   8.   9.   10. In an effort to purge the abuse of the Tor Network generating the least
problem to our users, only Tor servers with an exit to forums.gentoo.org
on the ports above stated will be banned. If they have those exits
removed, they'll automatically be unbanned. Please, notice that this
process of retrieving the list of Tor servers is performed automatically
and that it might take a while to have the ban-list synced.

@_subject: Client asked me to connect to myself! 
Hi all!
After upgrading Tor to 0.1.0.14 I get loads of '[warn] connection_or_connect(): Client asked me to connect to myself! Refusing.' in my log files. Why is that...?

@_subject: IRCNet abuse 
Just wondering: How do you know your server is used for IRC-abuse?  I
currently still have 6667 open, but would very much like to know whether
it's used or abused...?
   Evert Hash: SHA1
Due constant abuse I'm forced to configure my node to reject exit traffic to
ircd ports. I'm very sorry for that, seems like some people just cant behave
when they are anonymous. That sucks a big time...

MY IP is semi-fixed (ADSL, comes from a pool of 65535x2 addresses), so I
guess I'm only getting other people blocked/banned...  ;-)

:You could port sniff outbound 6667 ports with tcpdump or ethereal.
that's a bit rude, quite possible though.
I get direct abuse complaints since I'm my own ISP as it were, I don't know
how ISPs filter down or ignore abuse complaints, so don't know howmany
people this applies to.  If you are running on a fixed IP address with a
domain name you control attached to it you'll know.

A simple(?) question: I've configured my SSH client according to item

other private IP addresses?

Is it a good, or a bad (or neutral) idea to use your own Tor-server as entry node for your traffic?
