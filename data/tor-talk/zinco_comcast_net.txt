@_subject: both my servers crashed 
I have had a similar problem with XP but have never been able to pin it
down.  It seems that when tor is having trouble making a connection it bogs
down or stops all the other processes.  The resources seem to be fine when
it happens though when I can manage to get the task manager open.  I haven't
tried 1.03 yet.  Maybe you can help in the windows trouble shooting dept.
Not many around here run windows and I don't have sufficient knowledge.

Alas this could be the trouble or like you say part of it.  I also
listed some other events that stood out.  I will look into how to
change the TCP/IP connects and try it out.  I can see where that
would pose a real problem.  Thanks a lot.
The COM+ Event System attempted to fire the
EventObjectChange::ChangedSubscription event but received a bad
return code.  HRESULT was 80040201.

The few times that I have used tor client recently I noticed that it was
very fast as compared to before.
I also tried running tor server 0.1.0.1 on windows xp sp2 again and the
trouble I have been having seemed to be worse.  The behavior makes me think
it is a conflict with explorer.exe (not to be confused with internet

"I am not sure what is meant by "effective deterrent" here.? Does
mean you guys would like to deter windows users from running servers?
?Or deter windows users period?"
??? It means neither, because you've kind of gotten it sideways.
??? What was meant by my comments was that the REASON you already
don't see many W32 Tor servers is because everyone who tries to run
them (or nearly everyone, anyway) is having problems KEEPING them
running (if they can get them to run at all).
??? It has absolutley nothing whatsoever to do with "restricting"
anyone (in this case, all W32 users") from the Tor net or from
running servers - although I would like to bring out myself that this
may be the Tor developers only alternative (assuming W32 users can be
identified and "blocked" at all) if W32 users overload the existing
nodes, or bring about the possibility of government interference due
to W32 (or others', of course) use of the Tor network for

This is an age old and very difficult argument.  My right to free
speech and privacy vs. societies responsibility to protect the common
good.  Who defines "the common good"?  Who decides what speech I
should be protected from?  Who monitors it?  Certainly it should not
be those involved in tor.  I tend to err on the side of freedom and
privacy and my faith in private citizens to work things out.
Should all speech be protected?  Do I have a right to yell "FIRE" in
a crowded theatre?  Is there an analogy to that question on the
internet?  My guess is that if tor attracts that much abusive and or
illegal activity the network will not last and will not be available
for them or us.  I guess this would be the way the free market of
ideas works it out.  Notice the issue of IRC servers and of wikpedia
as of late.

Everything is going fine.
All of a sudden upload and download go to 0.
Cannot open any programs.
Any browser windows that are open and connecting will
never connect.
Programs that are already running will
minimize/restore/exit and work to some degree.
Sometimes everything will start working after 2 to 10
Longer than that i reset the computer.
Seems to get stuck at one certain spot and very little
else can happen until it gets past that point.
Even the task manager will not open with ctrl alt delete.
It seems to occur when it is trying to establish a connection of some type
and can't establish it.
My intuition tells me it is conflicting with one of the XP services but I
cannot verify that.

Maintains an updated list of computers on the network and supplies this list
to computers designated as browsers. If this service is stopped, this list
will not be updated or maintained. If this service is disabled, any services
that explicitly depend on it will fail to start.
After disabling this service things seem to be acting much better although I
did have one event where my computer automatically rebooted.  Couldn't gleen
much info after it though.  Normally I go weeks without rebooting and only
do because I figure it needs it.  I have been having to reboot a lot lately
with tor server running.  I have had the exact same problem with bit torrent
clients in the past.  Do they handle connections in a similar way?  I would
like to make sure I can get this running stable before I put it on the game
server which has mucho mucho band width.  That I have to administer remotely
and I don't want any problems with it.  I can have a much more liberal exit
policy on that machine.
Scratch that....exact same problem occurred even with that service disabled.

This is the first hop which was pinging at 1600 when I did a trace route
right after rebooting:
Well at least the first hop without tor running.  Seems to be that when it
cannot establish a connection it just holds everything up until it can execute the next command.  Can I
change the timeout parameter some how?

Yes I have the most up to date version of XP and tor.  I have
experienced the exact same problem with bit torrent in the past. Btw
I am not a big file sharer and could really care less about it, I
hardly ever use bt anymore, I won't use it with tor since tor wasn't
designed for it.  Since I have the same symptoms with tor as with bt
it leads me to believe it is something on xp's end.  The only think I
can think at the moment is that maybe I have some service disabled
that others do not.  I was hoping to find someone using xp and tor
server without any problems that could maybe send me a screen shot of
which services are enabled and disabled and I could go from there.
Do you use XP Aaron?

I am not sure what is meant by "effective deterrent" here.  Does this
mean you guys would like to deter windows users from running servers?
 Or deter windows users period?  I understand you probably have a
dilemma it that if tor was only open to *ix and other open source
OS's you would have a smaller and probably overall more responsible
and mature community.  Restricting windows users kind of goes against
the principles of open source, collaborative effort, free speech,
right to privacy,.ect. ect.  I can see the dilemma.
Seems to me you have to go one way or the other.  I think opening it
up will have more good than bad.  I have no reason to run a tor
server on my personal home machine yet for some reason I am willing
to.  If I get an email from my ISP they will certainly here from me
and I will put as much pressure on them as I can as a customer.  If
enough do this it will start to push the pendulum back the other way.
Matej the problem in America is that the pendulum always swings back
and forth, and too far on each swing.  Initially the internet was
totally unrestricted and there was no way an ISP was going to give
out a customers info or block anything.  Now with all the problems of
spam, porn popups, spybots, viruses, the MPAA, the RIAA.ect., ISP's
are under tremendous pressure to do something about it.  Trust me our
Congress is involved.  They tell the ISP's, "hey we don't want to
regulate you but if you don't do this or that we will have no choice
but to step in."  A mother sits down with her young daughter to go to
a website and a porn ad pops up.  This creates tremendous pressure on
congress and the IT industry.  Now you are seeing the effects of it
going to far the other way.
Which is why I think it is time for us to put pressure on the ISP's
and whoever else is blocking things.  I would much rather have
control over my machine than have my ISP act as a filter.  This
however requires me to do a certain amount of work to stay educated
and use the tools out there to maintain a clean machine.  Most people
don't have the time or don't want to stay up on security issues so
they put the pressure on the IT industry.  I think you are right that
society is to blame because we overreact every time there is a
problem rather than trusting that the free market of ideas and decent
people will find a way of working it out on their own.     Joel Rapin

Personally I have been having trouble with tor server and XP hanging up.  I
end up having to reboot enough times that I feel it is not reliable enough
to run.  Mine is a slow node but if I can ever get it running stable I will
put it on a very high bandwidth server as well.

@_subject: (FWD) Using Tor with IRC/Chat clients 
Andrew I do not know about IRC but I do know I have had similar trouble with
FTP clients.  If the application supports socks you do not need to use
sockscap.  I am not quite sure how this works but I believe with FTP in
passive mode the client initiates the request to open a data channel which
needs to be excepted by the server.  I think that if the server does not
have the right support or is not configured to support passive socks data
connections than it sends a request back which tor refuses.  I believe that
tor socks client will only allow outgoing data connections as allowing
incoming would defeat the anonymity purpose.
SocksCap does support socks4 and socks5.  Under socks5 there are options as
to where you want the dns names resolved.  I think in this case we want them
all resolved remotely.  Try sockcap in socks5 resolve remotely and sockisfiy
your app.  That doesn't seem to work with ftp because I think the issue is
on the server end.  Funny thing is sometimes FTP will work and other times
not on the same server.  It gets messed up when the client attempts to open
a data connection at the server.
227 Entering Passive Mode (**,**,***,***,**,**)
    Opening data connection IP: **,**,***,***,**,** PORT: 5912.
    LIST -aL
530 PASV command only accepts connection from client IP address
550 List failed. No port specified.

Don't know how much of this applies to your trouble.  And someone please
straighten me out where I am wrong.
I have Tor .92 running fine with Privoxy 3.03 and Firefox 1.0, but when
I try to use my mail client or IRC client, then the connection always
fails through Privoxy).  I'm not really a network guru so it's quite
possible that i've totally misunderstood how it should be used:
Mail/IRC/MSN Messenger work fine through Tor on it's own, as I specify
Tor localhost:9050 as the Socks4 proxy, but Tor gives the message that
the IP is being leaked, so I try to forward it through Privoxy on
localhost:8118 to hide my IP, but in every case, the connection is
refused.  Does Privoxy only work with web browsers?  When I specify the
proxy address in my client application, I understand that I have to
choose a HTTP client when using port 8118 on Privoxy, like I did with
I have Sockscap so that I can run a non-socks client through that, to
socksify them, but  cannot remember now if Sockscap supports a Socks4a
proxy.  If it does, should I run my other apps through Sockscap and
choose Socks4a, even if the client itself already has support for
Socks4/5?  Is that how I should protect my IP when not using Privoxy?
Or have I misunderstood the usage of Privoxy??  How else can I protect
my anonymity with non-browser clients?  Btw, I am most interested in
IRC/chat anonymity, not mail--I just gave that as an example.

@_subject: Hardware requirements for a tor server 
I was just brielfly watching the load on mine. 2.4 ghz cpu and it was using
3 to 6%.  Memory usage is 1500 to 8500 K in the time I am watching here.
That?s with an average of 25 KBs up and down.  All the above is from the client though I believe.  My server has not been
validated yet so I don't think it is getting much traffic.  I will post more
when server is validated and nothing else is running.  I would imagine it
depends on the bandwidth setting too.
Just curious.....If we have lots of middleman servers with low bandwidth
settings will that improve bandwidth and speed for the overall network?  I
can see where it would for bit torrent maybe, but it would seem it would
cause bottle necks for point to point.

I am definitely having a problem with tor server and xp.  Never noticed it
when running tor client only.  Although I have not used bit torrent in quite
some time, I have had the exact same problem or at least the exact same
symptoms with many different bit torrent clients in the past.  This leads me
to believe it has to do with the way xp handles things.  The problem behaves
slightly differently when I recently tested it with Zone Alarm off.

I think the problem in the U.S. in this regard is the fact that the
legislation can't keep up with the technology.  The
Telecommunications Act was last visited in 1996, which doesn't seem
that long ago.  It hardly even mentions the internet.  It seems to me
what happens is that the squeaky wheel gets the oil.  The motion
picture industry, and the record industry started lobbying congress
about five years ago and now they are getting results.  Now that they
did all the foot work the software and gaming industry will jump on
the band wagon.  The pendulum will start to swing back the other way
though because privacy and security are such big issues for so many
On that note I was wondering if any of you packet heads have inside
scoop on the security issue.
Since all the various internet protocols were not designed with
security in mind for the most part and security has to be layered on
top of it, which creates all kinds of trouble, what are the chances
we will be using a totally different protocol that someone is
inventing?  What are the chances the whole thing will be rebuilt from
the ground up?

In my case it is because I run it on my home desktop and it affects how
other internet apps and other apps period run.  Tor will hang at some point
and not allow anything else to happen until it proceeds.  This is on a
windows XP box.  Perhaps if I were running it on a separate box that I
didn't use it would not be a problem.  It seems there is no one available
with enough windows network expertise to investigate windows issues or maybe
my problem is unique.

at the moment I personally feel that Tor is affording people with  questionable intentions an extremely robust and simple to use method  to conceal their identity.  I have not read the 'challenges' paper  but is it correct to think tor developers justify (if that is the  right word) their developments by believing that if miscreants did  not use Tor they would simply move onto another similar mechanism for  conducting their business.
or would taking the tor network down cause any kind of disruption?
