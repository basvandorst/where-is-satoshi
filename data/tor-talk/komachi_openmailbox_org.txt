Meduza confuses exit nodes with entry guards, there was no announcement
besides that one, but most likely authorities will block them. Those
relays with both guard and exit flags will be blocked too this way, but
there is no reason to target exits.

group "to study the possibility of obtaining technical information on
users and users' equipment of Tor anonymous network" for $59,000. When
media reports appeared, mentioning of Tor was deleted.
Then company who won this contract (The Central Research Institute of
Economics, Informatics, and Control Systems, subsidiary of Rostec) then
posted a contract to hire a law firm tasked with negotiating a way out
of the deal
Now source of Kommersant close to the one of two parties of the deal
says that project was nearly finished, but CRI EICS didn't meet the
deadline, so that why there is court involved. Results was passed to the
Interior Ministry where it's already in use.
Representative of hired law firm told Kommersant that Interior Ministry
wants to just knock down the price or force CRI EICS to pay the forfeit.
Kommersant piece also mention a case when one user was deanonymized when
he used Tor Browser to post trip reports and prosecuted for propaganda
of illegal substances (I don't believe that was result of "cracking
Tor", he probably failed somehow (maybe used real name), also it would
be strange to perform probably costly attack for fine less than $100).

It's not like western LI. LI means there is order which ISP execute. In
SORM there is no such thing, just some black box with full traffic
mirrored on it installed at every ISPs with direct link to FSB (other
agencies get access mostly via FSB, but some install their own SORM). I
said, it's very similar to country-wide NarusInsight, or to much broader
Tempora. BTW that boxes not only intercept traffic, but also store and
analyze it.
I recommend you read The Red Web by Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan,
it describe Russian surveillance in details.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Russia failed to break Tor 
A company hired by the Russian Interior Ministry to identify users of
the Tor network, an anonymous Internet browser, has announced its plans
to terminate its state contract without finishing the task.
According to the Russian newspaper Kommersant, the Russian Interior
Ministry signed a series of contracts in 2013 and in 2014 with a company
called ?the Central Scientific Institute for Economics, IT and
Management Systems? (CSI EIM) to study and to fight online anonymity.
The newspaper reports that CSI EIM has now hired lawyers, in order to
terminate its four government contracts.
Information about the contracts between CSI EIM and the Interior
Ministry is classified. According to an investigation conducted by
Kommersant, however, one of the agreements, under the code name ?TOR
(Flot),? involved studying how to retrieve information about Tor users
and investigating what technologies Tor uses. CSI EIM was supposed to
earn 3.9 million rubles ($57,540) for the work.
In addition, CSI EIM won a government contract in 2014 for 20 million
rubles ($295,000), known under the code name ?Chameleon-2,? involving
?the creation of a hardware and software complex for allowing secret and
anonymous remote access to strategically important information.?
The Interior Ministry has refused to comment.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why most democratic contries are most active users 
Well Russia now has Internet censorship which heavy increased number on
Tor users
Also number of Tor users in US increased after Snowden's leaks, because
Tor is not only about censorship, but also about surveillance
Germany and other EU countries has the same picture.
So answering main question, it's because people in these countries are
more informed about Tor (Snowden recommended Tor, in Russia many people
advice to use Tor to bypass censorship) and trying to solve problems
presented in their countries. And because Tor is not blocked here (using
bridges can be sometimes harder for Chinese user than using VPN).
Another reason is because many dictatorships are small and by percentage
of Internet population dictatorships has higher ranks

I wrote a guide on topic So it should be easier to link this guide to website administrators if
you are experiencing troubles with accessing their Cloudflare-protected
website via Tor (and if you have a Cloudflare-protected website, please
follow this guide, you'll make Tor users a lot of happier).
