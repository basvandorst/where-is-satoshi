Even if this part of Kent, there are only three types of provision:
cable (Virgin), telephone company (varies but relies on a BT line in
the house) and satellite (mainly Sky and Freesat)  We have Virgin
because a) our landlord prohibits us from putting a satellite dish on
his house b) Virgin Media have lines buried outside the front door and
provide a more regular service than any other provider and c) The wife
and I rue the day we ever attempted to go with BT.
My carer tells me she got disconnected from the internet because of the
high charges she experienced, and others around me have confirmed the
same with their mobile charges ('mobile' is British for 'cell phone'),
so we won't be trying that route anytime soon.
What we two pensioners could do with is some advice about which
"independents" offer us an alternative service (if you have this
information) and any provider with support for Linux or Free Software
would be a boon.

@_subject: [tor-talk] VOIP and tor 
This all sounds too complicated for me!
Is there any VoIP service that can be used with Tor (or JAP) running
under Linux that is easily set up and has helpful manual pages.
To be clear: I want a service without cost, but if that is not
possible, could anyone suggest a low-cost service in the UK?
I'd really like to use VoIP to contact friends and family, but
(preferably) I want one that resides on my computer and is without
cost, but low-cost is a possibility.

Why not try startpage.com then?
AFAIK the web spider is an open source and free application, but I
could be wrong there, and there isn't a FOSS one.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Ebay problem 
I've started to find that my Ebay.co.uk account is rejecting my contact
when Tor is running, but does not do that if I switch off Tor.
I can't find the reference, but I'm sure that I saw that the NSA had
asked for, and received assurances, that details of Ebay transactions
would be handed to the NSA.  By implication, this means that the
information is being handed to the European police and other agencies
via GCHQ in Cheltenham, UK.
Has the Tor project been made aware of this behaviour of Tor when
connecting to Ebay.co.uk? And is there any advice to overcome this
