@_subject: Tor & SSH server 
I need some help running Tor and Putty, hopefully someone can point out what I'm doing wrong...
I've managed to get my setup to work as follows:
Firefox > Privoxy > Putty > Tor > SSH Server > Internet
Putty is using Tor as a proxy (so the Tor exit node connects to the SSH server), and the SSH server is provided by cotse.net
Everything works fine, apart from one thing - cotse have 2 proxies on the SSH server, a filtered one on port 8080 and an unfiltered one on port 8888.  All my web-browsing is going through the filtered proxy.  I can't figure out how to use the unfiltered one.  There's nowhere in my Putty config (that I can see) where I can specify port 8888.
In Putty I have port forwarding set up to forward port 9050 to a dynamic destination.  I tried setting the destination to 127.0.0.1:8888 but that didn't work.
Any help would be appreciated.
