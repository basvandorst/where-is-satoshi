@_subject: strange problem since upgrade to 0.1.0.17 
hey list,
i am running a tor server for quite some days now. it all worked fine
using 0.1.0.14 but since i upgraded to 0.1.0.17 strange messages are
found in the tor.log.
the first, which pops up every couple of minutes is:
Apr 01 17:33:29.646 [warn] circuit_receive_relay_cell(): Didn't
recognize cell, but circ stops here! Closing circ.
Apr 01 17:33:29.646 [warn] command_process_relay_cell():
circuit_receive_relay_cell (forward) failed. Closing.
and the second one i cant really imagine why is:
Apr 01 18:46:42.614 [notice] conn_close_if_marked(): Conn (addr
[scrubbed], fd 772, type Dir, state 5) is bein
    g closed, but there are still 835094 bytes we can't write. (Marked
at main.c:554)
is this anything which i should pay attention?
i dont have any firewalls, or other things on this server, it just with
no restrictions as a middleman.
thanks in advance,
