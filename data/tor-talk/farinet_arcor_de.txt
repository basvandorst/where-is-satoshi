then we exchange the data.

It's not clear to me why torbirdy by default sets the port for socks
forwarding to 9150 while on the other hand the default port for tor is
9050. And Torbirdy explicitely underlines it presumes the installation
of tor.
Thanks in advance for your patience.

If so it makes sense. But, for me, an all machines where i installed tor
(debian, ubuntu, arch) the tor config file (/etc/tor/torrc) always came
with port 9050 as default.
I quote from the untouched default file 'torrc':
 Tor opens a socks proxy on port 9050 by default -- even if you don't
 configure one below. Set "SocksPort 0" if you plan to run Tor only
 as a relay, and not make any local application connections yourself.
SocksPort 9050 # Default: Bind to localhost:9050 for local connections.

Thanks. BUT: shortly said, i'm sitting here on a ppc based machine and
there is no ppc version in the tor repositories. So, i'm obliged to use
those of debian ... ;-) (I pinned them to use sid, so that i'll always
get the newer ones).
Put it simply: The default port for tor now is 9150 not 9050 (i found
the last one in many instructions, cfr. e.g. bodhizazen.net, but i'm
always willed to learn)?

Thanks a lot for your patience. I got it now :D :D
torbirdy than all a setup with concatenated proxies ... ;)
My question was just out of curiousity.

Possibly, i don't know (?). But there's no ppc version on the tor server
... Do you have another source?

Geoff Down:
I see. In any case, in the debian repositories i find the the 0.2.4.22
version the same as the stable on the tor download page. Is there any
reason to not have confidence to the debian repositories?
