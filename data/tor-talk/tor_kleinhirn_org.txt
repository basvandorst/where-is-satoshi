@_subject: End of ROCKate soon 
Actually, it's a little more complicated than this. The law is, as
always, voted on by politician who understand nothing of the matter -
being a student, I'm living in a house with five law students, and asked
those to fine-read the law just passed. Their conclusion (though there's
no warranty that it ain't off by miles):
If judges really stick to this law, and do not concern themselves with
common sense (as they sometimes don't...), this new paragraph could be
used to sue not just IT professionals trying to fix security leaks, but
even Professors and students studying security-related engineering. It
really is that bad, because to be convicted under this law does not
require any attempt or even intent to do anything bad or wrong. It just
says that you're guilty if your work could in any way be related to or
used to doing bad things. And which program can't..?
Thus, it's not too surprising that this is not the first, and certainly
will not be the last, great project maintained from Germany, that will
cease to exist - at least for a while. Until there's some rulings that
tell us how serious this threat really is, most of us will keep their
heads down.

@_subject: running tor on a vserver 
I've been running tor on a vserver for some time now, smooth and stable.
The problem on vservers is, that your usage of hardware resources is
very limited (which you can't do anything about!), so you'll have to
figure out just how much your vserver can take. I'm running it on a
Strato-vServer and have no warnings whatsoever with a Bandwith limit of ~200 KB/s. If I set the limit much above that, my log gets flooded.
But as I said, you're gonna have to figure out your limit for your
particular server.
Oh, here's one more piece of advice that should save you some trouble:
Don't use the Accounting - options in torrc, but rather the BandwithRate
& -Burst. With accounting, tor will try to burn the allowed  traffic as
fast as possible within the first period, and thus lead to LOTS of
warnings in your log. So grab a calculator and do the math for yourself ;)

@_subject: Tor Traffic Problems 
Hi everyone,
just as Michael last week, I'm having huge problems with the tor
bandwidth usage.
It just won't stick to the limits.
Background info:
I'm running tor 0.1.2.14 on SUSE 9.3; smooth and stable so far. To test
it, I turned it up to the default speed last night, reaching the 3 MBit
marks in each direction without producing any warnings or errors.
My torrc is as follows:
BandwidthRate 110 KB
BandwidthBurst 150 KB
ExitPolicy accept *:80,accept *:443,accept *:6660-6667,reject *:*
ExitPolicyRejectPrivate 1
My traffic monitor tells me that traffic is not even close to these values:
 & [For those who don't like images: 6h-Average of ingoing traffic 275KB/s,
outgoing 384KB/s, maximum of 900KB/s and 700KB/s]
With virtually all of the traffic being generated by tor (restarted tor
at 11.14 this morning according to the log; before there was almost no
traffic at all).
Now, the question is: what did I do wrong..? Of course I could just use
the Accounting options (which worked fine for me last night), but that
would disable the directory mirror. Plus, I'd like to know where the
mistake is and not just build a work-around ;)
I appreciate your help

Sadly, what you say is true. Precautions have to be implemented in Tor
that no more than one node from Germany is chosen for any connection. We
should ask tor development to implement such a feature until 12/2008,
and have it activated automatically before the end of next year.
Actually, it might be wise to develop a feature that lets the client
choose no more than one node from _any_ country, since other EU
countries might use the directive that led to the german law, to pass
similar laws. Anonymous communication is something a lot of executive
agencies would like very much to get rid of, and this might be their way
to achieve that goal.
But please, everybody, do not overreact by blocking german tor nodes.
The law will only have an effect for tor operators by the beginning of
2009, and I doubt anyone will start logging before that. Blocking german
tor nodes on a larger scale will have a very serious impact on tor's
network reliability and speed, which is something we don't need.
Plus, there's still a chance the german Supreme Court
(Bundesverfassungsgericht) will stop this law before the end of next
year. The lawsuit is under way...

Tor users, agreed. Tor servers... seems pretty unlikely to me. Why would
our Chinese friends be more "generous" in setting up exit nodes than the
rest of us? Honestly , it doesn't make any sense at all. Yes, it is very
likely that we've got a much higher proportion of tor users in china
than in, say, Old Europe - because the internet is being censored, and
thus tor becomes even more useful; it's not just protecting your ID, but
also giving you access to otherwise restricted content.
But does it make sense for someone with a censored internet access to
set up an exit node? A node, yes. Doesn't matter where the traffic is
being routed through. But an exit node, no. Why would I confront others
with the censorship I myself am trying to evade?
Doesn't make much sense to me.
Agreed! Thanks for sharing the link.

That I could give you by the dozens. Just read between the lines every time a news service reports of another pedophile network being torn apart - there's always some part suggesting there were at least some people who were smart enough to hide their traces and therefore got away. And it shouldn't surprise any one of us. Where there's possibility, there will always be someone abusing it.
But I still believe the vast majority of tor users is using tor for legitimate purposes (like those you cited - purposes tor was intented to serve); therefore protecting their privacy as best as we can is to be made a priority, even over preventing abuse of tor by allowing outside control. As has been pointed out on this list before, it would be very hard to draw a new line once the current has been crossed.
Plus, and that's something I've been wanting to point out for some time: tor is only of very limited use to someone wishing to regularly transmit more than just a few kilobytes, since it tends to be quite slow. So while I still believe there are people abusing tor, I don't think they're that many. Most internet users today have been spoiled into prefering speed over security.

I believe this to be the most interesting question... since the user does not know his connection will be relayed via a client-exit, there will only be encryption up until the last relay (the one advertising itself as an exit). Therefore, even if you re-encrypt the data for transfer to the client-exit, it will now be *two* hops being able to read the user's traffic in cleartext.
I don't think that's an improvement... I'd even go as far as saying it's the exact opposite of what we want.
Plus, having the last relay re-encrypt the connection will add additional CPU and RAM load, which IMHO is not a good idea.

True. But...
If everyone would use tor the way it was meant to be used, no problem here. But as you know, rogue exit nodes have become a problem within the tor network; this feature would provide for them a very nice cover to hide under. Since your connection is in plain text for two hops now (or at least two hops can read it as plain text), there's also two hops that can mess with your traffic. And while today it is pretty conclusive to say if someone messed with your traffic, it was the exit node (therefore this node should be considered "bad"), after introducing this feature that would no longer be possible (since, as was proposed, noone but the last node would even know the client-exit existed, or its IP; and even if that was openly advertised, testing for malicious tor nodes would become that much harder).
It's not an attack from the outside I fear here, but one from within the network. Something tor is already very vulnerable to as it is.

Nice thougt, but on second thought impracticable for various reasons: as you pointed out, it sacrifices security, which IMO is not up for discussion. Also, it would become much harder for new tor nodes to be added to the network (I, for example, do not know any other tor operators personally) and therefore would also sacrifice potential capacities and performance. Plus, we don't really gain any security, since an "attacker" would only have to gain the trust of one established operator with one legitimate node to add the imaginary thousands of illegitimate others to his trust list and therefore to the web of trust.
Just my thoughts...

Chad Z. Hower aka Kudzu schrieb:
I don't think from a technical pov the entry point is an issue; all data passing through there is encrypted, so malicious intent would have to meet serious computing power to do damage (except for dropping the packet alltogether) at that point. Also, as you indirectly pointed out by simply not mentioning them, relays are even less an issue. So I guess "uncredited" routers would still be usefull as middlemen.
However, it might actually be worth considering an *optional* feature that would allow tor to only use exit nodes within your web of trust, since exit nodes are the ones who could potentially do "bad things". But I believe it would also be a serious threat to your anonymity (a site that can identify you uniquely over a longer period of time, i.e. your email provider, could log all exit nodes you connect from, and from that draw conclusions to who's in your web of trust, from where it should be only a small step towards your true identity). One would have to choose which threat one prefers.
Is there anyone who could give a (somewhat professional) assessment of how a web-of-trust feature would impact on anonymity? How about tor's overall performance?

Hey, let's try not to tear each other to shreds here, we're all on the same team.
And btw, noone ever claimed that a provider proxy would hide your identity from anyone. It's just one more step law enforcement has to go to get to you, or at least a little more money they have to spend. Digging through logs can be very time- and ressource-consuming.
And I disagree on your view about the use of (non-provider) proxies in general to route your tor exit traffic through. As "dr no" pointed out, many sites log only the IP address, not any Forwarded-For or similar headers. So while those proxies cannot be *trusted* to provide any level of obscurity or anonymity, they *might* with luck proove to be a dead end (or at least a serious obstacle) for investigations. Especially if they are in another country.
Again, just to make sure noone misunderstands it: none of this provides any security (for the tor node operator) for certain. But it decreases your chances to get harrassed by law enforcement. Maybe just slightly, but it does.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
