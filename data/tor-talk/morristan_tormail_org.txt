Silk Road reported to make $1.9 million per month, Tor Project reported to make $1.3 million per year,  (page 3). Read carefully, Tor Project lost $17,285 in 2010 on revenues of $1.336 million. In plain english, they spent more than they received.
Perhaps the Silk Road people should donate to Tor. Perhaps they should fund hidden service improvements in Tor. Perhaps both.
This informs me a few things:
1. Tor is easier to use than we think, given motivation to do so.
2. 150,000 or so people use Tor for hidden services, or for silk road alone (a hidden service).
3. Tor is not profiting from hidden services.
4. Tor and hidden services are good enough for an ecommerce platform.
Who will make the first profitable, legal ecommerce site on dot onion?

Tor cannot market and state " network of drug cartels worldwide". If so, the tor project people will find themselves arrested and the scapegoats for the US war on drugs. Canon does not market their cameras as "great for child pornography" even though the high-end Canon cameras are the  camera for child pornos. I suspect the flickr breakdown by camera model is just as valid for child pornos as anything else,  As a curious side project, I am analyzing all of the EXIF info from child pornography to determine which cameras are popular. I suspect iphones and canon cameras are well Please do and publish all of the data you collect. Do not publish just the data that matches your suppositions. Torgle and other .onion search engines should help you.

You did not answer Andrew's question, rather you went off into a tangent. How would you promote Tor?
Please explain, in detail, how you use Tor and why you use tor to get us started.
