I, too noticed same problem: especially with hidden service.
I don't know if this is related at all, but I have received personally
unconfirmed report of the fact that one of Japanese magazine which is
released on 1/8/2005 covered Tor, and I actually heard that it
promoted use of a one of domestic file sharing software in that
article (with some detailed how-to's for accomplishing it), and that's
like 3 weeks ago.
So it might be some be some clueless people using Tor network to do
that. (It probably sounded them very good, because legal issues of
file sharing is getting really harsh over there after arrest of the
author of the file sharing softwares.)

Currently there are two major filesharing software in wide use.
Winny and "share"

Just for additional points about those programs I have listed, they are particularly messy as they can choose arbitary ports to use. Currently users of Winny is going down after its author got arrested. "Share" users are uprising as it features much more robust structure. Due to that arrest it is expected those variant will be deployed at large scale. I think what motivating use of tor is for the fact that a lot of ISP are started blocking access through those programs and the fact some place user "intelligent" firewall for that purpose and users are trying to find a way to circumvent those limitations.
