@_subject: [tor-talk] Iranian users cannot download Orbot from Google play 
Over the past couple of days Iranian users have been complaining about not
being able to download Orbot from Google's play store (error 403).
To solve the problem we at help desk send the official direct download link
that GP provides[0] but it's only a matter of time before that get blocked
I think GP will need to provide more download options in the future to
avoid this problem.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor bridges not working 
Downloading .torrent files isn't an issue but if you forward all your
torrent client traffic through the Tor network then you are hurting the
network and your anonymity.
First, your version is highly outdated, try to update from one of the
following mirrors:
It also seems that your institute's firewall is hijacking connections like
Cyberoam and Kaspersky.
See: Even if you download the pluggable transports bundle to use obfs3 bridges
you won't be able to input your proxy settings because the bundle doesn't
support it yet.
Your best bet is to use TBB 2.3.25-15 with a bridge on port 80.  (
37.139.9.131:80 I've set this bridge up for such situations.)

@_subject: [tor-talk] More and more websites block Tor, 
Not sure if they block all exit nodes (if any). I just successfully opened
You can't force people not to block Tor, it's their website and they are
free to run it the way that works best for them.
Secret/unlisted exit nodes??
I don't think that will ever happen (hiding exit nodes), the only way is
either to educate people about Tor or detect an abuser and block/ban him
for abusing the Tor network.

@_subject: [tor-talk] StrictExitNodes deprecated? 
The correct syntax is:
EntryNodes {node, node, ...}
StrictNodes 0 or 1  for disabled
For more information about how to configure Tor see the manual:
Note: it's recommend to leave Tor handle your path selection automatically rather than specifying one yourself as it can greatly harm your anonymity.

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor browser bundle uninstalled 
It's not a matter of changing your IP, you can do that by a VPN or a proxy
TBB contains:
- A modified Firefox (mainly privacy patches)
- Tor client, HTTPSEverywhere
- TorButton
- Vidalia Control panel
TBB does a lot for you. For example: TorButton forces you to not install
disables java/flash by default, HTTPSEverywhere forces websites that are
enabled to keep you on HTTPS all the time and many more.
Using Tor alone and socks proxy won't constrain addons or Firefox from
leaking you real IP
and other information.
