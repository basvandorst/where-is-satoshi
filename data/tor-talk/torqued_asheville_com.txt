Quoting Roger Dingledine :
When I read the following post last month in a.p.a-s I just _assumed_ it was a
kid trolling.
 - Posting in the clear through Google with his Portland, OR Verizon IP flapping
in the breeze.
I now _assume_ this Usenet post is related to the subject at hand (?)

      This is the only tool that prevents side channel attacks against Tor.
   This happens because JanusVM is transparently proxying ALL your TCP
   traffic through Tor.
   HD Moore had a very nice example of why you should NOT trust your
   applications to always use Tor correctly.  JanusVM doesn't have this
   problem because it catches everything at the Network Layer.
   Also, I am going to be releasing a 0-day against Tor @ DefCon15 this
   year that will reveal your true IP address. :-P
   Needless to say, the 0-day will not work against those using
   JanusVM.
   And no, I'm not releasing ANY details about it until Defcon.
   Enjoy!
   Kyle

@_subject: piNg: Mike Perry - Torbutton 1.1.5 
First off I want to thank you for the time and effort you and your colleague(s)
have put into this project.
For the love of all that's Holy, please tell me a way of turning off the mind
numbingly annoying:
--> False win hooking. Please report bug+website! <--
Is there anything in 'about:config' I could modify/delete to turn OFF this
_feature_ (cough) of Torbutton 1.1.5?
Say I've got two or more browser tabs open in FF, the error messageg ALWAYS
appears when I click back and forth between the tabbed browser windows.
It matters NOT what URL I'm at.
For example, in one tab I can load:
and in a second tab I can load:
They both load fine, however, if I click back and forth between the two tabs the
afore mentioned error message ALWAYS (re)appears (requiring a click to the 'OK'
button to clear)
(X86)XP SP2
Firefox 2.0.0.5
-DOM Inspector 1.8.1.5
-Flashblock 1.5.4.1
-NoScript 1.1.6.08
-Torbutton 1.1.5
Tor v0.1.2.14
Privoxy 3.0.6 Win
I could revert back to Torbutton 1.0.4 but I really like the added
security/anonymity features of 1.1.5(alpha)
And while I'm on that whole security thing With all the many extremely talented coders/hackers/former cDc
members etc, who read this mailing list, would it be so terribly
difficult to put up a 'web page' that throws every single
exploit known to mankind at the visitors browser to test for leakage?
I mean there are dozens of "what your browser reveals about you"
sites around the planet based on Java/JavaScript and the
 seems to
go one step further in showing Flash plugin leaks. But what I'm
talking about is a single site which trys to exploit/decloak
Quicktime/Realplayer/Acrobat/MS Office yada,yada, plugins,
helper apps, file types, etc. Not by actually by opening/viewing
vids,pdfs,docs etc, but by merely having them as 'plugins' in
the visitor's browser.
Pipe dream?

@_subject: portable Tor 
Is it also possible to 'force' tor to use the usb
drive to store its 'cached-directory' file as
well? (as opposed to the default
%user%/Application Data/tor/cached-directory)
The following command line does not prevent tor
from creating '%user%/Application
Data/tor/cached-directory' :
tor -f torrc cached-directory
Is there an opption one could add to the 'torrc'
file which would force the creation of the
'cached-directory' file on the usb drive, only?
Enlighten me, please...
