Hash: SHA1
I had to change my nodes exit policy to much stricter due abuse, now my node
only allows traffic to port 80 and 443 (thats just sad but hope it helps).
When I restarted my node (do you have to restart node If policy changes?) I
got following warning messages:
Jun 21 10:13:14.751 [warn] exit_policy_implicitly_allows_local_networks():
Exit policy accept *:80 implicitly accepts localhost (127.x)
Jun 21 10:13:14.752 [warn] exit_policy_implicitly_allows_local_networks():
Exit policy accept *:80 implicitly accepts addresses in private network 10.x
Jun 21 10:13:14.752 [warn] exit_policy_implicitly_allows_local_networks():
Exit policy accept *:80 implicitly accepts addresses in private network
Jun 21 10:13:14.752 [warn] exit_policy_implicitly_allows_local_networks():
Exit policy accept *:80 implicitly accepts addresses in private network
Jun 21 10:13:14.752 [warn] exit_policy_implicitly_allows_local_networks():
Exit policy accept *:80 implicitly accepts addresses in private network
Ok, my mistake. Added some lines to config, heres the whole exit policy:
# Just for showoff
ExitPolicy reject *:25
Exitpolicy reject 217.78.206.0/24:*
Exitpolicy reject 62.241.240.0/24:*
Exitpolicy reject 62.197.172.0/24:*
Exitpolicy reject 192.168.0.0/16:*
Exitpolicy reject 10.0.0.0/8:*
ExitPolicy reject 127.0.0.0/8:*
ExitPolicy reject 169.254.0.0/16:*
ExitPolicy reject 172.16.0.0/16:*
ExitPolicy accept *:80
ExitPolicy accept *:443
ExitPolicy reject *:*
Then I restarted my node:
Jun 21 10:19:28.418 [warn] exit_policy_implicitly_allows_local_networks():
Exit policy accept *:80 implicitly accepts addresses in private network
Uh? Other messages disappeared but warning about 172.16.x... Bug or my
And logging (from my nodes config):
 Send all messages of level 'notice' or higher to /var/log/tor/notices.log
Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
Doesnt that mean that level 'warn' should go there too? Well it doesn't,
those warnings about exit policys never ended up in logs... How to fix this
and really log notices and higher?
And third, is this anything to worry about?
directory_handle_command_get(): Client asked for the mirrored directory, but
we don't have a good one yet. Sending 503 Dir not available.

Ehh... I'm all fed up with these blacklists. Why block mails because
mailserver is also running Tor? Mails are sent directly, not through
tor-proxy. Theres no point in that, my exit policy denies exit to port 25.
These sorbs-aholes are also demanding a "donation" to get your server off
their db's (spamdb), in some cases It's not even your fault that your server
is listed there (inherited spammers ex-ip's for example).  It's nicer to
filter spam "by-mail" not "by-host" or even "by-netblock". I think that they
are blinded by their good cause and forget that they are also blocking
legimate traffic and doing nothing about it.

The fine is small but annoying (50$). "You inherited the netblock or address
after your provider moved a spammer" - why to pay them for something that
you havent done (or why pay them anyway anything)?
Only proof is what I read from their website:
 How did I get listed in the first place...? Well there are a few
        a.. You are a spammer who has spammed a SORBS spamtrap or admin.
        b.. You are hosting DNS, webservices or mailservers (etc) for a
spammer that has spammed a SORBS spamtrap or admin.
        c.. You are an innocent party that has been included in a wider
listing policy because your provider is happy to host spammer(s) that have
spammed a SORBS spamtrap or admin.?
        d.. You had your machine hijacked by one or more spammers who have
spammed a SORBS spamtrap or admin.
        e.. You have a machine with a virus or trojan that has spammed a
SORBS spamtrap or admin.
        f.. You run an unsecure mailing list that has been used to spam a
SORBS spamtrap or admin.
        g.. You inherited the netblock or address after your provider moved
a spammer.
      SORBS will not delist you without paying the 'fine' for any of these
      ? If you are part of a wider netblock that is blocked you are not
required to pay the SORBS 'fine' as the entry was not generated because of
your actions, however your netblock will not be removed until your upstream
removes the spammers.
 The 'fine' is US $50.00 and is designed to be small enough to so that the
home user will think twice about getting listed a second time, and small
enough to be a 'right royal pain in the butt' to any large company. The idea
being, that whether you are a multi-national company or a single home user,
you will think twice about getting relisted for any reason.

I'm running Tor on my router (Debian Sid) that transparently proxies
connections through Tor. This way you dont need to configure any clients.
for http-traffic:
client - iptables (idenfication by ports and L7) - squid - privoxy - tor -
and for everything else:
client - iptables - transsocks - tor - server
I'm controlling with iptables what gets  proxied and what not, everything
else is proxied through Tor expect VPN-connections and connections to couple
of trusted servers. Udp, icmp and other protocols except tcp are dropped at
the router. This way connections by software and games that "call home" are
also proxied through Tor.

- From "man bash":
       ulimit [-SHacdfmstpnuv [limit]]
              Ulimit  provides  control over the resources avail-
              able to the shell and to processes started  by  it,
              on  systems  that allow such control.  The value of
              limit can be a number in the unit specified for the
              resource,  or  the  value  unlimited.   The H and S
              options specify that the hard or soft limit is  set
              for  the  given  resource.   A hard limit cannot be
              increased once it is  set;  a  soft  limit  may  be
              increased  up  to  the value of the hard limit.  If
              neither H nor S is specified, the  command  applies
              to  the  soft limit.  If limit is omitted, the cur-
              rent value of the soft limit  of  the  resource  is
              printed,  unless  the H option is given.  When more
              than one resource is specified, the limit name  and
              unit  is  printed  before the value.  Other options
              are interpreted as follows:
              -a     all current limits are reported
              -c     the maximum size of core files created
              -d     the maximum size of a process's data segment
              -f     the  maximum  size  of  files created by the
                     shell
              -m     the maximum resident set size
              -s     the maximum stack size
              -t     the maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
              -p     the pipe size in 512-byte blocks  (this  may
                     not be set)
              -n     the  maximum number of open file descriptors
                     (most systems do not allow this value to  be
                     set, only displayed)
              -u     the maximum number of processes available to
                     a single user
              -v     The maximum amount of virtual memory  avail-
                     able to the shell
              An  argument of -- disables option checking for the
              rest of the arguments.  If limit is  given,  it  is
              the  new  value  of  the specified resource (the -a
              option is display only).  If no  option  is  given,
              then -f is assumed.  Values are in 1024-byte incre-
              ments, except for -t,  which  is  in  seconds,  -p,
              which  is  in  units of 512-byte blocks, and -n and
              -u, which are unscaled values.  The  return  status
              is  0  unless  an  illegal option is encountered, a
              non-numeric argument other than unlimited  is  sup-

lot of pages, to programs that attempt to coordinate an avalanche of posts
in the forums (often through misconfigured "Open Relay" proxy servers).
? You might be using a proxy server that is also being used by another

anything involving child abuse (meaning CP) should be available.

for that.
Defeating censorship is good, CP is bad. It's sad but CP and child abuse
just doesn't go away but that doesn't mean that we should accept it and
stop fighting back.

much over any protocol so blocking some ports won't help anything.

@_subject: Problem with bandwidth 
Try to set BandwidthBurst to 20 KB. It should help, at least it works for me. One of my exit nodes uses Bandwidthrate 200KB and BandwidthBurst 250KB and other one uses 100KB and 100KB. No problems.
"This value should be at least twice your BandwidthRate."
That was new to me. What version are you using?
I'm using v0.2.0.2-alpha and `man tor` says following (and nothing about that it should be twice as BandwidthRate):
BandwidthBurst N bytes|KB|MB|GB|TB
Limit the maximum token bucket size (also known as the burst) to the given number of bytes in each direction. (Default: 6 MB)
Taken from  5.17. What bandwidth shaping options are available to Tor servers?
There are two options you can add to your torrc file:
     *  BandwidthRate is the maximum long-term bandwidth allowed (bytes per second). For example, you might want to choose "BandwidthRate 2 MB" for 2 megabytes per second (a fast connection), or "BandwidthRate 50 KB" for 50 kilobytes per second (a medium-speed cable connection). The minimum BandwidthRate is 20 kilobytes per second.
     * BandwidthBurst is a pool of bytes used to fulfill requests during short periods of traffic above BandwidthRate but still keeps the average over a long period to BandwidthRate. A low Rate but a high Burst enforces a long-term average while still allowing more traffic during peak times if the average hasn't been reached lately. For example, if you choose "BandwidthBurst 50 KB" and also use that for your BandwidthRate, then you will never use more than 50 kilobytes per second; but if you choose a higher BandwidthBurst (like 1 MB), it will allow more bytes through until the pool is empty.
If you have an asymmetric connection (upload less than download) such as a cable modem, you should set BandwidthRate to less than your smaller bandwidth (Usually that's the upload bandwidth). (Otherwise, you could drop many packets during periods of maximum bandwidth usage -- you may need to experiment with which values make your connection comfortable.) Then set BandwidthBurst to the same as BandwidthRate.
Hope this helps...

$mynode was my exit nodes name) in address bar, waited a moment and got

Thank you for the information. I'll reconfigure Squid to strip some

I'll also add some options transparent redirect so it only redirects
http-traffic. Squid saves a lot of bandwidth every month even that I
recreate cache every time Squid is restarted.
Squid's cache and logs are encrypted with random key (/dev/urandom)
using aes256. Every time Squid stops file containing encypted fs is
umounted and cryptsetup deletes that device. A new encrypted loop device
is created when Squid starts. Also / and swap are encrypted, the only
partition that isn't is /boot. So squids cache and logs are contained in
encrypted container that resides on encrypted partition. Should be
pretty safe? I could not hand out keys to squids logs and cache event if
I wanted to because key is derived from /dev/urandom.

As far as I know tor operators have been raided in Germany and Finland
by ignorant cops who does not know anything about proxies or that one ip
does not mean "one person" (ever heard of NAT, proxying or routing for
example). How about other countries?
How to avoid that nasty raid (at you home) and that oh so sweet paranoid
feeling after that? Any ideas?
How about following (just my two cents):
Running exit node on computer that is physically located at some ISP's
server farm?
Renting a server from a different country, maybe a whole different
continent and running exit node there? If you live in Europe and your
country belongs to EU then maybe outside of EU? What would be a "good"
country? How about service providers? - Maybe a good idea?
PTR records (reverse dns)? Ip that translates to something like
proxy.domain.com or tor-proxy.domain.com? Are the cops smart enough? Do
they care? (I don't personally think that they care or understand.)
Running exit node at local library's poorly secured computer? - That
ain't nice and it's illegal - no.
Running a exit node on computer owned by some "civilrights group"?
Encryption? Is it good or bad if cops take your servers? If you give
your keys to cops they can check that there ain't no cp. If your hard
drive is not encrypted police can check it easily. What about privacy?
Police tends to take all the computers and not just the one(s) running tor.
What about encrypted container in encrypted fs's slack space for your
private data? Then one can hand the outer volumes keys to police without
any worries.

@_subject: Tor operator raided in Finland 
I don't think that it is banned. Police just does not understand proxies and thinks that traffic going through the proxy was originated from the proxy and that the proxys administrator is downloading everything that in reality just goes through the proxy.
Finnish Law has a paragraph that states that service providers are not responsible for traffic that goes through the proxy or for material that customers upload to their sites (but service provider must remove illegal material as soon as they notice it or as soon as cops call them).
Yes there is but not the same size as in China. Finnish netcensorship should block cp but they also block legal porn for example. They also block the traffic by servers ip-address, not by the domain. As one ip can contain multiple websites, email server, ftp, dns proxy and so they block them all if even one cp-site is working on that server.
Imagine a service provider that hosts multiple sites, dns-server and email for many domains and one of it's customers upload some cp on their site -> finnish police blocks EVERYTHING that resides on that server. They do not even try to catch the illegal sites admin or remove the illegal material, they just censors the whole server.
I'm also afraid that they are going to start censoring everything that they don't like even if it's not illegal. The system to censor net is already build so next step could be that they start censoring criticism for the state, copyright infrigments and so on. Maybe I'm just a bit Finnish "MPAA" tried to misuse the system and already tried to add sites to blocklist that they don't like. I't did not succeed.
The blocking is very ineffective as cp can be routed through many different ways, not just http. I think that cops should not try to censor the web but try to catch the paedophiles that hurt the children.
Also the sentences for rape or statuatory rape are ridiculous here. Paedophiles that have raped children and get convicted for the first time will get only probation sentence. So they don't go to jail and one can break his probation only by committing same crime as they were sentenced. So if one has raped children and then beats up some children he does not lose his probation.
It's just sick. One can rape and beat up a women and does not get any jailtime at all. If he does it again he maybe gets something like 6 months. For the third time he may even get two years! This is just ridiculous. Fines are also very small, usually something like 500 euros to couple of thousand euros. Same goes for the compensation for victims. If rapevictim gets 10 000 euros compensations it's unsually big compensation and the rape has been unusually brutal.
Heres an example (in finnish)  "Schoolboy convicted to probation for raping 8 year old girl". The girl was 8 years old and the raper 16. He raped the girl at least three times in a row. The court said that the incident was "unusually humiliating". The boy got 1 year and 10 monts probation and he has to pay 11 000 euros as a compensation for the victim.
Okay, this was quite unsual case as the raper was only sixteen but rest of the rape sentences (and statuary rape) are quite the same.
I'm not trying to avoid local censorship or trying to do anything illegal. I'm trying to protect my privacy. I'm not sending junk mail, I'm on the different side as I work as server admin and try to stop spam. I only proxied the traffic that I'm blamed for, it did not originate from my server.

First of all, some informationa about the situation:
I'm running two nodes in Finland, very restricted exit poliecies
(googles ip's, scroogle, https, pops and imaps allowed).
Circa 90% of traffic originating from Finland and going outside of
Finland is routed through Sweden (that bites a lot).
As Swedish FRA is listening, logging, building "sosiograms" and trying
to decrypt all traffic going through their borders should I be worried
about my exit nodes? Should I do something about exit-policies?
Encryption does protect the data but it does not protect from tracking
who is in connection with who. As I run exit-nodes that routes traffic
about 2Mb/s/2Mb/s - 10Mb/s/10Mb/s and 4Mb/s/4Mb/s I'm getting my fair
share of tor's traffic. So.. FRA is building a nice file of my ip and
thinks that everything coming from tor is really traffic originated by me.

logs that someone (e198212.upc-e.chello.nl - 213.93.198.212) had several
connections per second to dirport. That someone tried to use
CONNECT-method to connect several other servers. Server responded 500
every time (Internal error or something) but that would not stop the
dossing that had been going for hours. I'm not logging typical
connections to dirport, only odd ones.
I wrote a fail2ban-filter to catch him and others doing the same. I'm
not sure what attacker tried to gain with such method, attacks came
always from the same ip and ten connections per second isn't enough to
bring the server down. Also he could not get connection via
CONNECT-method anywhere through the http_proxy, he only got error messages.

If the package came from Fedoras repository they may use their own
init-scripts. Contact Fedoras bugreporting.

I would go with the Debian init-script. I have used it for years without
any problems. Much better that Tor's own contributed init-script. It is
much nicer to wait the process to die than to kill -9 them and cut users
active connections.
I recommend that you take a look at the tor-debian-init-script and fix
Fedoras init-script by using Debian's init-script as an example.
You can find Debian Lenny's tor-init at
Oh jea, the script contains little local change by me but it's all in
one place and start of local changes is marked by  # START OF LOCAL
CHANGES and the end of local changes is marked by # END OF LOCAL CHANGES.
I had little problems with tor eating all memory and slowing the server
to a crawl until it was impossible even to ssh to the server. Played
with ulimit and found working values.
ps: I'd really want to run a tor exit-node but I have to think about my
family. I don't want cops all over the place again, scared the shit out
of my wife. If I lived alone it would be much easier.

@_subject: RentalSponge exit-node cut off by ISP, uncertain future 
Hash: SHA1
Hello list!
Just wanted to tell you that I just today got couple of copyright-abuses
from the servers ISP. They thought that the server was r00ted. I replied
them in a friendly manner, explained some Tor-stuff and directed them to
Tor's site which tells how Tor works. I also told them that I'm willing
to discuss more about Tor and answer any questions they have.
Before I rented the dedicated server I talked with the ISP about
tor-exit, explained it and they told that it was ok to run a tor-exit-node.
The server was a dedicated tor-exit, it's name was tor-proxy.domain.com
and reverse lookup gave the same name. On port 80 ran an Apache server
which had information that told about tor and that the server in case is
a dedicated tor-exit.
Bandwidth was limited to about 30Mb/s with burst up to 50Mb/s. It had a
100Mb/100Mb connection which was shared with other customers. The ISP
had a qos so one user could not hog all the bandwidht. I asked them
about the bandwidth hogging and they said it was okay to use as much as
I want, they handle the fair sharing of the bandwidth.
RentalSponge was middle-man at first. It ran as an exit about one week
before the ISP cut it off the net. For two first days the exit policy
was really open, only denied access to port 25 and to some private ip's
which had servers that had firewall based policies.
After two days I changed the exit-policy 'cause the cpu could not keep
up with crypting and decrypting onion skins. I changed the policy to
allow exit to ports 20, 21, 80 and 443.
I'm waiting for the ISP's answer to my email. The future of RentalSponge
is uncertain but if I in any way can run it as an exit-node I will.
I will inform this list as some new stuff comes up.
ps: as always, sorry for my bad "euro-english"

Hash: SHA1
Looks like the story of RentalSponge is over. I'm very sorry for this
but theres nothing I can do with my current ISP.
They said that running a tor-exit is now banned on their network. Before
I rented the server they said that I could run an exit node without any
interference from them. The point at renting a server from them was that
Tor was ok even when I told them that there is going to be dmca / abuse
The ISP in case is Tenue oy  a finnish ISP which
rent's virtual servers etc.
I'll try somehow to get some new server to run tor-exit with but it
could take a long time.

I've been wondering this for a long time. How do you keep your exit node
running without interference from ISP / local police etc.? Especially
when it's the largest exit node.
I've had two exit-nodes which both we're closed, first by KRP (National
Criminal Police, finnish) and had all my hardware taken by cops (2008)
and second one was closed by ISP (2010) even I had informed them about
Tor-exit and asked if it was okay to run exit node. It was until they
got first abuse-notices, then they shut the node down. I was able to run
it about six days.
I was able to get off the contract because ISP broke their promises.

Okay, that cleared things a lot. I Guess that authorities treats that
ip-range as an ISP.
Last week I was in contact with my ISP and it is possible to have your
companys etc. information on the ip-range that you use but still it
shows also the original whois-information.
I have been thinking a long time how to run a stable exit node without
getting constantly in trouble. Your own Whois-data on your ip-range
(abuse-contact etc) could help a lot.

Own Ripe assigment would be great but how to get that? My local ISP only
offers to add some of my companys information to the top of the existing
Do a "whois 62.241.236.0", the data existing there would stay but my
companys data would be above it. Not sure if that's so good idea, I'd
like it to only show my own information and nothing from my ISP.
I Don't have any information about the subject but would it be possible
to buy own ip-range which would stay in my possession even if I switched
ISP's. I don't think it comes very cheap...
Btw, really big thanks for running blutmagie-exit!
