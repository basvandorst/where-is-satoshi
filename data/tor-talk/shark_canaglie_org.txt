@_subject: [tor-talk] General question regarding tor, ssl and .onion. 
I'm curious, I'm developing an app whereas sharing/collaboration
can be done by localhost through tor and .onion address between pairs or
multiples. When I use standard http there seems to not be any problems
connecting different computers, different IPs, etc. and interacting, but
when attempting to do it under https there isn't any connection. Https
is definitely functioning with original hosts.
     My question is, since things are already going through tor with
.onion connections and things encrypted anyway, is not using ssl really
presenting any sort of serious compromise on anonymity? Wouldn't it be
sort of like encrypting the encryption?

Seth and et al,
Thank you very much for the answers. It basically confirmed what I
thought. Was also experimenting with a self-signed cert anyway as people
connecting would already have a direct association.
My thoughts after answers, while not knowing how everything works behind
scenes, are the browser fights to establish https, then .onion (or vice
verse) and slow or intermittent Internet connections presents problems
with socks?
Also, while it was said that .onion encryption was of lower standard,
wouldn't a high degree of privacy and randomness still be assured,
except for maybe alphabet agencies and more nefarious types out there
specifically targeting a subject or .onion addresses in general, and
some serious work and resources would have to go into pinpointing and
breaking said encryption?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is it possible to adjust the number of hops through Tor? 
If yes, where exactly in files would that be done?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Problem with where hidden_services able to be 
I tried a couple of things.
Gave complete permissions to user at
set-up a directory in user's Documents folder.
In both instances Tor would not make a connection. Had to revert all
settings back to only allowing files to be placed with root restrictions
in /var/lib/tor/ (torrc was correctly set to best of knowledge in both
I'm using Debian, Tor was installed from apt repositories using
instructions from torproject.org, with adding line to sources.list and
keyring, etc.
Need user to have access to hostname file.
Did read something about differences in privileges depending if using
apt or downloading tarball?
What is solution?

Yes, running Tor 0.2.6.10.'Do you see there files like
cached-microdesc-consensus, lock, state, etc.?' Files do exist in
'HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80'
The '/var/lib/tor' by default is limited to root. I did some tests
deleting 'hidden_service' to regenerate new .onion addresses. All fine.
The normal 'user' of system can't access '/var/lib/tor'. I changed
permissions of folder. Tor wouldn't generate new hidden_services files
or connect. I created a new folder 'hidden_service' in user's
'/home/user/Documents' and changed torrc to
'/home/user/Documents/hidden_service'. Tor wouldn't generate new
hidden_services files or connect.
Changed everything back, back to normal... What I'm trying to do is have
a fresh OS, that when a new user starts for first time, a unique .onion
address is generated for them and it is easily displayed on a start
page, without them having to fish around in files or having to use
editor, terminal, etc.
(On another note, the tor lists has been the quickest response/most
helpful for a novice, that I've encountered. Thank you all.)
If you installed from deb.torproject.org I assume you are using Tor
0.2.6.10, correct? (run # tor --version to check this).
Please explain once again what you did, I don't exactly understand.
Have you restored a hidden service for which you had backups of
private_key and hostname files? Or did you leave Tor to create a new
hidden service? What do you mean by 'set-up a directory in user's
Documents folder'?
If you have installed via apt, your datadirectory should be
see there files like cached-microdesc-consensus, lock, state, etc.?
Also, the username who should run Tor on your system is debian-tor.
Please provide more details and torrc entries.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Using .onion address for MQTT pubsub. 
Just a little experiment after seeing Home Assistant. Is it possible to
start a Mosquitto server and publish / subscribe using tor address?
I tried doing:
mosquitto_sub -h abcdefg123456789.onion -d -t hello/world AND
mosquitto_sub -h abcdefg123456789.onion -p 9150(and mqtt port) -d  -t
mosquitto_pub -h abcdefg123456789.onion -d -t hello/world -m "Hello
World" AND
mosquitto_pub -h abcdefg123456789.onion -p 9150(and mqtt port) -d -t
hello/world -m "Hello World"
There wasn't a connection on either end. So obviously, I'm doing
something wrong. What am I missing here as far as making the connection?
