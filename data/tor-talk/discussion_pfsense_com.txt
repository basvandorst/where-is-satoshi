Tor will bind to one inside address hung on a firewall leg. Portforward ingress traffic hitting the entire public range to the inside   +ToR host and pool nat egress traffic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      No guarantee that it'll work. But it should generate traffic over the entire assigned block.
