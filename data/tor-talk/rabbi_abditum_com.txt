Call For Papers
CodeCon is the premier showcase of cutting edge software development. It
is an excellent opportunity for programmers to demonstrate their work and
keep abreast of what's going on in their community.
All presentations must include working demonstrations, ideally
accompanied by source code. Presentations must be done by one of the

    * Authors notified: January 1, 2006
Possible topics include, but are by no means restricted to:
    * community-based web sites - forums, weblogs, personals
    * development tools - languages, debuggers, version control
    * file sharing systems - swarming distribution, distributed search
    * security products - mail encryption, intrusion detection, firewalls
Presentations will be 45 minutes long, with 15 minutes allocated for
Q&A. Overruns will be truncated.

The program for CodeCon 2006 has been announced.
CodeCon is the premier showcase of innovative software projects. It is a
workshop for developers of real-world applications with working code and
active development projects. All presentations will given by one of the
lead developers, and accompanied by a functional demo.
Highlights of CodeCon 2006 include:
iGlance -           Open source push-to-talk videoconferencing and
                    screen-sharing
Monotone -          Low stress, high functionality version control
Query By Example -  Data mining operations within PostgreSQL
Djinni -            Efficient approximations to NP-complete problems
Elsa/Oink/Cqual++ - A static-time whole-program dataflow analysis for C
                    and C++
Truman -            An open-source behavioral malware analysis sandnet
VidTorrent/Peers -  A scalable real-time p2p streaming protocol
The fifth annual CodeCon takes place February 10 - 12, 11:30 - 18:00, at
StudioZ (314 11th Street) in San Francisco. Early registration is $63,
available online until February 1st, 2006.

We hereby solicit papers and demonstrations.
    * Papers and proposals due: February 15, 2009
    * All Authors notified: March 1, 2009
Possible topics include, but are by no means restricted to:
    * community-based web sites - forums, weblogs, personals
    * development tools - languages, debuggers, version control
    * file sharing systems - swarming distribution, distributed search
    * security products - mail encryption, intrusion detection, firewalls
    * malware analysis - detection, compensation, and mitigation of
      emerging threats
As a new feature this year, CodeCon will be presenting a Biohack! track.
While we will continue our tradition of presenting only one talk at a
time, a portion of one of the days' talks will be reserved for interesting
biotechnology hacking projects. A key requirement for these presentations
is ease of reproduction with minimal access to expensive laboratory
Example topics include:
    * Purifying DNA using common household items
    * Developing genetically-modified bacteria in a kitchen laboratory
    * Using specially-designed software to assist in bioengineering
    * The use of simple bioengineering techniques to solve real-world
      problems.
Ideal Biohack! Track submissions will have a strong emphasis on the
"hack" portion of the talk -- in the last few years, there has been a
strong growth in the community of biology hackers; we aim to bring these
hackers together to discuss their techniques for inexpensive, at home
experimentation in biological engineering research.
Presentations will be 30 minutes long, with an additional 15 minutes
allocated for Q&A. Overruns will be truncated.
Submission details:
Submissions are being accepted immediately. Acceptance dates are
February 7th and March 1st. After the first acceptance date, submissions
will be either accepted, rejected, or deferred to the second acceptance
The conference language is English.
The conference venue is open to all ages.
Ideally, technical demonstrations should be usable by attendees with
802.11b connected devices either via a web interface, or locally on
Windows, UNIX-like, or MacOS platforms. Cross-platform applications are
most desirable. Biohacking demonstrations should be viewable with a
presenter-provided camera, or prepared movies for projection.
