@_subject: [tor-talk] Behind a very unkind ISP 
Hi, I have to use a laptop to acess the intranet as I live out in the middle of nowhere. Unfortunatly, the library is almost the only choice I have. It might not be a problem exept that they forbid acess to many freeware/opensource sites, most ftp servers are blocked, and I can't do bittorrent at all. I downloaded tor but it will not start up. The log is in the attachment. I tried to go to your help manual but it to is blocked. I would not mind if the government (USA) blocked the pron or something like that but this is rediculas. I also tried complaining but that only made me emenies everywhere (I did politly with "please" not like a jerk, "I MUST HAVE X,Y, AND Z!!)
Please help!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Cannot access tor onion sites via FF 
I'm running firefox 61.0.1. I am trying to access the media outlet
defcon's onion site.  points me to:
I have network.dns.blockDotOnion false
network.http.referer.hideOnionSource true and
network.proxy.socks_remote_dns true.
Tor's  reports that I am using tor.
This:  is said to be the tor projects
home page which times out. Defcon's address returns "Unable to connect"
without any perceptible delay.
The reason I am trying to reach defcon over tor is that my connection to
them is plagued with connection and speed problems. First I tried their
torrents, but after a few minutes rtorrent returned an SSL connection
error, and a torrent not allowed on this server error. I notified defcon
and now the tracker is down. Not even a ping responce.
Second, I tried the media server directly, at first it worked and I could
download. An hour later or so, the server began returning SSL connection
problems. Here is a curl dump:

It is now going again. For about 30min it was moving at 1/10th speed, now
it is going faster. This is very strange to me...

Ah, finally I find out how the TBB has been changed.
1. I did not know what they changed.
2. Where is the source code?
3. Noscript is a poor man's privacy protector. I use scriptsafe. It has
many JS fingerprinting protections. And yes, many sites do require JS. I
block as much as possible by default.
Fixed. Now tor works, thanks!

@_subject: [tor-talk] How do tor users get past the recapacha and it's super 
Many websites, for example: have a page called:
"One more step
Please complete the security check to access XXX"
It requires that I enable JS for several things and then reads that I
have a 2 min exception, after which I have to complete another challenge.
This makes browsing the web unbearable.
As if it cannot be worse, I often get the challenge correct, but googles
idiot box (my name for their AI server), frequently gets the challenge
wrong (for example, it misses the side of a sign, misclassifies an image
altogether, or thinks that there is something there that is not and the
actual item is in another corner), which causes me to have to preform
another challenge. Not that you guy know, but rather to make a point, why
am I or anyone else even willing to train their AI for free?!

I think I'll try that.
Na, I've got bigger ideas for my time.

Perhaps you could tell them (or tell me how to tell them), that I am
legit. I get the full Captcha every time.
They *really* need to increase the timeout.
That is useful, is there an instruction that I can point authors to?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Here's a new one: DELETE the page if client uses tor! 
Yup, I did not believe it either, until I tried disabling all plugins and
then reload the page and open the web inspector in FF. All the content is
gone after the page is mostly rendered, but the ADs and trackers are
still there to take advantage of any info they can pull from your browser.
Disabled tor re-enabled all plugins and reloaded and the website works
fine. Repeated 2x because I could not believe it.
It appears to be caused by JS, which is needed for rendering the page
content, but I have not found the relevant snippet, it seems to self
delete, which is even more suspicious. I did not think JS could do that,
but I can think of no other explanation for a partial page render and
then the whole thing, tags and all, disappears. Someday I'll write a
monster movie about the things I've seen people do with JS.
And now, the guilty party.... (Drum roll),
And I thought that google's youtube was evil (example):
Any known workarounds, or are we stuck with this?
