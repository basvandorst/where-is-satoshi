This is a simple issue, but important. The script should check to see if Tor/Vidalia is already running and just open the browser. As it is, if I close the browser, come back some time later, and click the Tor icon, it results in an error because Tor is still running in the background. I can't open urls from other applications with the browser for the same

Are you a dev for the browser bundle? Your expectations are unrealistic. Most people using Linux do not build their own packages, they use packages built for them by the distribution maintainers. Some distributions will patch packages to suit their needs, but others don't make decisions that should be made upstream as a matter of policy and only provide vanilla packages.
I'm making a suggestion for the official package. That is allowed, right? This is an open-sourced project, right? You're in luck, though, I do know some programming/scripting. I'll look into the problem myself if you're interested in a patch.
IMO, the ideal behavior is that tor will continue running. Some people use the proxy for other applications. The script should check to see if Vidalia is already running, and if so, just launch the browser. If you prefer the behavior be consistent with Windows, though, I'll do that

Sorry about that. I would have searched the tracker, but I didn't see it. I was thinking for a second there that you didn't have one. Sometimes I fail at using the Internet.
So I'm not an expert in shell or anything. I know there are a lot of gotchas. It seems like it should be possible, though. Is there something wrong with using pgrep or something?

Oh. I got no ideas for that. :/

Ok. I was thinking of Tor Browser and the bundle as the same thing. To confirm, you're saying the bundle as provided is only for local installation? But wouldn't installing the browser globally necessarily conflict with Firefox? It's useful to have both...
What do you recommend for packagers?
Is there any reason to have multiple instances of Tor open?
Ok, I've looked through the script. Seems like it just tells Vidalia where the Tor Browser is located. Perhaps Vidalia itself should have a flag to relaunch the browser.
