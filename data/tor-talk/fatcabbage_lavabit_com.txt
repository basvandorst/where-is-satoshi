kinda rough, but it's a start. Maybe Pedro can improve. Also, I haven't
worked with translation software, but I am a software developer and I am
willing to help.
P.S. both 0.0.10 and 0.0.11 work for me in Ice Dove on Debian squeeze.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Orweb & orbot 
Yeah, the git repo is probably solid. Personally, I installed Orbot from
FDroid, which is the main market app I use. I don't want all of my app
downloads to be associated with my gmail account (as is the case with
Google Play). Also, FDroid contains only free software.

If anyone is interested, I have some minor spelling and editing
suggestions for the primary design document. For reference, there's a
copy at
1.1 Goals and Non-Goals, page 3.
Currently "defeat author identification based on linguistic analyzes"
I suggest "defeat author identification based on linguistic analysis"
1.3.1 Location Privacy, age 3.
Currently " . . . it makes totally sense to do that."
I suggest " . . . it totally makes sense to do that."
1.3.2 Pseudonymity
Currently ". . . does not want to loose their job"
I suggest ". . . does not want to lose their job"
2.1 Assumptions. Page 5.
Currently: "We assume that SSL/TLS [60] is reasonable secure . . . "
I suggest: "We assume that SSL/TLS [60] is reasonably secure . . . "
As far as getting the bird up and running myself, I was just getting
plain "cannot connect to server" errors. I think I screwed up the
general email server settings, but I also didn't realize that I had to
run a Tor instance. Once I got tor running, I was good to go. For the
record, I'm on Ubuntu 10.04 with Thunderbird 14.0, tor 0.2.2.37, and
OK, peace everyone. Thanks a lot to Jacob Appelbaum, Sukhbir Singh and
tagnaq for getting this off the ground. (saw you three in the
acknowledgements at  )
P.S. did my reply add to the thread? I am new to mailing lists and reply-to.
