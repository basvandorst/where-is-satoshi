I see now. My apologies! I pressed the button indeed multiple times, but the window with the mail didn’t close after pressing the button. Even disabling GPG signatures made no difference. After a few minutes I force quitted my mail client and went to other things. Now I’m also surprised that not a single spam filter across the infrastructure noticed this.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
