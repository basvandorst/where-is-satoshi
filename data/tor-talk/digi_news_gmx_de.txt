@_subject: WinXP_client_problem 
Since tuesday i got nearly no connection to the Tor-network :-/
The Log-window show a lot of notices like this one:
"AUG 25 21:39.929  [notice] Tried for 60 seconds to get a connection
to [scrubbed]:80. Giving up."
The curios thing is that this only happens on my xp box.
(i tried the current stable and the latest alpha version of tor)
On my Linux boxes everything works fine!
Has anyone an explanation for that?

Hello phobos,
pro> Have you tried restarting Tor on Windows?

pro> firewall or antispyware block tor?
Thanks for your answer, but this wasn?t the problem.
I guess that i had the most problems on wednesday last week and that
was the day with less performance than usual.
see: Maybe the xp-client has more problems with such situations than the
one i use on Linux.
I checked the logs on both systems and on Linux there were the same
notices but not as many as on the XP-machine, so i think the
client on Unix based systems works better but i cannot proof that.
In the moment of this writing everything works fine ;-)

Most of the wikis give a solution if programm foo has no socks4a support
and how to solve this with eg. socat
What i want to do is that all dns-requests from the local machine go

Is this possible?
Or do i have to do it manually for each application that do a DNS query?

yes, if you run a server! The directory servers have to know which nodes are available
 and which are down for whatever reason. So they lookup the ip of "your" server.
This has nothing to do with the routed traffic through that node.

Since a few weeks there are no RPMs for the new tor builds :-/
So i thought it is a good idea to build them for my own ;-)
I am far away from a RPM specialist but it worked, please feel free to
download it and make any suggestions what i should do better next time.
If i done not too bad i can also manage the next releases and if you
want i can be the maintainer of the Tor RPM packages.

is wrong. I cannot check if the connection is available from

Hello Matt,
MT> I second this nomination.
Ok! It seems that the RPM works for some people :-)
Is there anyone who can check this for eg. RH9, Fedora and so on?
I have only checked the RPM for RHEL4, CentOS4, Whiteboxlinux4 which
is mostly the same distribution as you know.
It would be great if some of the Tor members can give me a link to
post the fresh RPMs to - maybe the Tor.eff download site??
I can provide the RPMs on my small ftp server, but this is not a good
solution because it is a little bit to slow and not designed for big
traffic ;-)

@_subject: Server unresponsive question ? 
Hi, again!
I postet a similar question a few time ago but the problem still
exists and i found no reason for that behavior, maybe someone else
can make my mind clear?
My Tor-server is behind a firewall in my internal net.
The firewall (a devil-linux based system) keep also track
of my broadband connection.
After 24 hours my connection is interrupted by my isp as usual.
This also happened today:

As you can see at 18:26:03 i have a new ip!
But my Tor-server(0.1.1.7-alpha) could not be reached correctly by the
Dir-Servers since then.

@_subject: Tor-server and dyndns Problems! 
Dear, all
After problems with telling Tor that my server-IP has changed, i followed the suggestion of Peter Palfrader and installed the actual
CVS version. Peter told me that this version has better handling with
dynamic ip checking.
But unfortunately it seems not work very well, here some snippets from my logfiles:
Yesterday my IP changed to:
Tor recognizes this:
It has changed twice within one hour (from 80.171.230.159 to xxx.xxx.133.10 this time).  Ignoring for now.
Why it is ignoring my new IP? As you can see the xxx.xxx.133.10 is the correct one but it is ignored!
Tor now try to use still the old and not updated IP
...and again
It has changed twice within one hour (from 80.171.230.159 to xxx.xxx.133.10 this time).  Ignoring for now.
Please check your firewalls, ports, address, /etc/hosts file, etc.
Today in the morning i checked the log and i send a HUP to my tor and
it works:
Maybe someone can help me to solve the problem.
I think it is not very elegant to HUP my Tor-server every 24 hours by cron or similar things.
I also could not understand why Tor "thinks" that my ip has changed twice in one hour and ignoring the correct IP.
Hope that someone can help me to keep my Tor-server up 24/7!
Maybe it helps if someone can explain how exactly Tor finds the correct IP of a server?
Thanks a lot

I have a question about the onion-router status page at:
If a server gets down it is visible on this page in a few minutes so everyone can see which server is reachable or not.
But this seems to work not quite well with broadband connections that i and many others have.
Today my ip changes at 19:52 local time (germany) since than my server is signed "unresponsive" on that page and many others too.
But my Tor-server works fine and i think the others too.
Is there a chance for that nice page to check if the ip of some servers has changed so that the correct status is shown?
Or did i miss something and other things went is wrong?

I use dyndns too. I checked again an you?re right, after a few minutes
my server is signed as online again, but it seems that the time beeing
"unresponsive" varies.

I use Thunderbird only for fetching and sending mail and for this it

As you correctly found out the problem is the nttp server on port 119.
As a workaround i would suggest to use tor-resolve to get the ip for
your news service and put this ip directly into thunderbird or use a
different application for reading news.
Hope that helps
