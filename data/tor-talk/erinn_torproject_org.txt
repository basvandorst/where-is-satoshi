Hi everyone,
I've setup an RPM (yum/zypper) repository for Tor and Vidalia. The
following distros/releases are available:
Fedora: fc10, fc11, fc12
OpenSuSe: 11
CentOS: 4, 5
Vidalia is available for fc11, fc12, and OpenSuse. Tor is available for
CentOS 4 and 5, fc10, and OpenSuse. I've tested all except the fc10 repository. There may be key problems
with that one, so if anyone is testing for fc10, please let me know if
it works. General feedback is also encouraged/welcome.
Depending on your distro, add these to your yum and zypper .repo files
(or create a tor.repo file):
OpenSuSe in /etc/zypp/repos.d/:
name=Tor and Vidalia
fc10 in /etc/yum.repos.d/:
name=Tor and Vidalia
fc11 in /etc/yum/repos.d/:

fc12 in /etc/yum/repos.d/:
name=Tor and Vidalia
CentOS4 in /etc/yum/repos.d/:
name=Tor and Vidalia
CentOS5 in /etc/yum/repos.d/:

From the Vidalia release announcement here:
On November 2, we released Vidalia 0.2.6. Primarily a bugfix release for
OS X issues. The changed items are:
    * Remove the erroneous comma in the default vidalia.conf in the
      Mac OS X drag-and-drop bundle, since we now dump whatever the
      user types into a QString rather than parsing it into a
      QStringList.

Hi everyone,
I've been working on making a Linux Tor Browser Bundle and I need some
testers with 32-bit Linux systems. This is extremely alpha -- do not
expect it to work perfectly and don't depend on it for privacy (unless
you happen to be running Debian unstable, like me, where it seems to
work flawlessly every time). Pre-requisites: you need to at least be able to run Firefox already and
you need to shutdown Tor, Polipo/Privoxy, and Vidalia. Existing
Firefoxes/Iceweasels do not need to be shutdown.
It can be found here:
If it doesn't work for you, please do the following:
- Tell me your Linux distribution
- Send me any relevant shell output
- Run ./start-tor-browser --debug and send me the vidalia-debug-log
- From within the TBB directory, run: 'strace -f -e open -o ff-opens.log
  ./App/Firefox/firefox -no-remote -profile ./Data/profile' and send me the output
Known issues
- If it doesn't launch Firefox the first time, try closing everything
  and re-launching. - It might complain about not being able to find the display if you
  launch from shell
- System xulrunner via /etc/gre.d/*.conf hijacks Firefox
- It runs, but torbutton doesn't appear to work (in my VM, 11.2). Preliminary
  testing indicates that it runs on 11.0
- It makes SELinux pretty unhappy

  check your system for an old zlib:

Hi everyone,
It is now possible to track either stable or experimental releases of

In order to use these you'll need to update your repo config file. For
example, if you're on FC12 and want to track the experimental branch,
you'd use:
name=Tor and Vidalia
In addition to that, the signing key is now the same for all
repositories. I will leave the old keys up to give people time to
transition, but they are going to disappear in two weeks. I highly
recommend switching now if you're using anything besides this one:

* M  [2010:10:16 18:48 +0000]: Hey there,
I am working on writing this up -- I sat down with Mike Perry, the Torbutton
developer, and we went over what each of the Firefox extensions added. It's not
in any kind of proper document yet, but here are my notes about the new
extensions so you aren't left hanging for too much longer:
- pre-emptively converts http URLs into https URLs for many popular
  sites that support https
- majority of options are disabled
- allows users to globally toggle javascript
- provide click-to-play placeholders in the event that users want to set torbutton to
  enable plugins
- exists only to delete flash cookies in the event that users allow
  plugins and run certain flash apps. it cleans up any data that flash
  might write outside of our control. (backup mechanism.)
I'll let you know when I have a fuller analysis available.

* Justin Aplin  [2010:10:27 01:46 -0400]: This is actually a weird Firefox thing -- depending on where you install the
extensions, they either show up in the add-on list or they don't. The Torbutton
extension is installed somewhere different from the other extensions, because
that was how I got it to work originally. So it's installed, and it works, it's
just some accidental ninja obfuscation happening. (Incidentally, it *does* show
for me on 10.5, so it took me a while to figure out what was happening.)
BTW, does the Torbutton toggle button show in the bottom right of the browser
for either of you?
I'll see if it will actually work in another location so it'll show up, because
it should. It just didn't originally.

@_subject: Tor Browser Bundle for Mac OS X released 
Hi everyone,
Tor Browser Bundle for Mac OS X is now available for the i386 architecture in
11 languages. Snow Leopard users: please read about the known bugs at the
bottom of this email.
The Tor Browser Bundle lets you use Tor without needing to install any
software. It can run off a USB flash drive, comes with a pre-configured web
browser and is self-contained.
You can download it from the Tor Browser page which also has instructions about
how to extract and use it. The bundle comes with the following software:
* Tor 0.2.2.15-alpha
* Vidalia 0.2.10 -- cross-platform controller GUI for the Tor software
* Polipo 1.0.4.1 -- caching web proxy
* Firefox/Namoroka 3.6.9 -- web browser
* Torbutton 1.2.5 -- Firefox extension to enable or disable the browser's use of Tor
* NoScript 2.0.2.3 -- Firefox extension to only allow scripts from trusted sites
* HTTPS-Everywhere 0.2.2 -- Firefox extension to provide encryption to a major number of websites
This is a beta version which has primarily been tested on an i386 Leopard machine.
Early testers on Snow Leopard report that Firefox does not launch the first
time they launch the Tor Browser Bundle app. The workaround for this is
currently to stop Tor with Vidalia and then restart it. They also say that the
Torbutton status bar on the bottom of the Firefox window does not show up, but
Torbutton functions properly. Please give us feedback and file bugs.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TB for Win 
* Mike Perry  [2011:04:12 05:49 -0700]: Minefield is just the name it gives itself when I build it from source, along
with its own set of Minefield-y icons. Some user experimentation indicates that
a non-zero number of users don't even realize this is a browser at all, much
less what they should be using.
Because of a misconfiguration in the OS X TBB last year, the toggle button on
the bottom didn't appear, and one user remarked that he thought this was
deliberate since Torbutton shouldn't be toggled while using TBB anyway.
I'm more worried that users will have two Firefoxes open, and accidentally use
the wrong one because they can't distinguish between the two. It's hard to
anticipate which things would go wrong.
As an aside, I met some nice people at a conference once and they suggested
that if we can't afford real usability testing, we should just go sit in coffee
shops and interrupt random people and ask them to use our software and give
feedback, then buy them a cup of coffee. Maybe we should really do this.

while they do use the ~/.mozilla directory, it's technically a .mozilla
directory inside of TBB's main directory. So the short answer is yes, it does
it in a way that doesn't conflict with normal installations of Firefox.

I actually really like this idea. Getting Debian to apply our patches to
Iceweasel would also have the positive side effect of us finally being able to
drop Polipo as part of our Debian & Ubuntu instructions (provided Ubuntu also
applies the same patches), which would achieve our long-standing goal of having
our Debian/Ubuntu packages work smoothly and out of the box. I think providing Torbutton in the tor-browser package, or having
xul-ext-torbutton provide a menu entry might be the better solution. (I don't
actually know if packaged Firefox extensions are "allowed" to add menu
entries.) I'd be shocked if FTPMaster let us put a tiny tor-browser package in
the archive. :)

Hello or-talk,
I've made a few test bundles with libevent2 and I'd like people to test them --
run them for a few days and make sure nothing too wacky happens as a result.
These are not officially supported, and until the changes are incorporated with
official packages, they will only be updated if I have time.
How to report bugs on these packages
x86_64 only!
I've updated libevent to libevent-2.0.10-stable, OpenSSL to 1.0.0c, and rebuilt
OpenSSL with -Wa,--noexecstack which should prevent SELinux on the latest
Fedora(s) from refusing to let it run. I built all of the libraries and
binaries against a newer glibc (2.11.2-7) so if you're running an old one, it
won't work. (This is not the support policy for official bundles, but Qt won't
build against an OpenSSL built with -Wa,--noexecstack on Debian Lenny with
glibc 2.7 for reasons I've yet to figure out. Anyone who might have insight
into this is encouraged to email me.)

delete the group from existing systems altogether? Is it as simple as just
removing all of the other torgroup mentions from the .spec (and there are quite
a lot of them)? Does it do the right thing when it gets installed for a new

I suspect for a new user it's fine. It's the transition part I don't know about

Hi everyone,
Just a quick note to say that the Firefox 8 bundles are delayed because the
change in the way add-ons are managed[1] means that with a fresh, unused
profile (as is the case with TBB), the extensions we ship are disabled by
default. That means Torbutton is disabled by default and no prompt appears to
ask you if you want to keep all of your extensions. When Torbutton is disabled,
it just looks like you can't connect to the internet/Tor because the browser
message is "The proxy server is refusing connections". We're talking to developers at Mozilla right now to sort this out and I will
have the update out as soon as possible. Very, very sorry for the delay!

We want to drop polipo from all of the bundles. Currently it can only be found

they need an http proxy at times when they do not, but I think there must be

* cgp3cg  [2011:09:05 16:19 +1000]: No, this is not deliberate and must be a bug. The prefs.js we ship has:
user_pref("app.update.auto", false);
user_pref("app.update.enabled", false);
We enabled addon updates because we believe it is safer, but that is a
different setting. I see in my own TBB that app.update.auto has been set to
true, but I certainly didn't make it that way either as a user or developer.
Thanks for noticing, I'm going to add fixing this to our next update (September

* Julian Yon  [2011:09:05 11:52 +0100]: I'm learning about sync now. Is it really so simple to get decloaked in one
simple click? The website says you have to sign up for an account, which I
imagine you also then have to log into deliberately before syncing.
If it's that easy I agree it should be disabled, but if it's not, I can imagine
people wanting to use it (which is, of course, not the deciding factor but
still something to consider). I'm going to read about it more, but if you have
any more information you think I (or other Tor devs) should read, please pass
it on.

* Koh Choon Lin <2choonlin at gmail.com> [2011:09:05 20:57 +0800]: The reason for this is that in the old versions of TBB with FF3.6 on linux, I
binary patched libxul.so in a filthy way so that it would not pick up system
plugins; on Windows it was possible to comment out a section of
nsExtensionsManager.js that scanned the Windows registry. On OSX I never
figured out how to stop it.
However, as of Firefox 4, there is a pref called extensions.enabledScopes which
allows you to define the scope of plugins and limit them to things like "just
this profile", "just this app", "just this user", etc. In the current TBBs it
is limited by profile (the most limited and mandatory scope) but it seems to
behave somewhat unpredictably. It used to be that it did not even show all of
the plugins, now it shows them but you have to enable them. I should look into
this to make sure there isn't another pref interfering.
You can read more about this here:

* Erinn Clark  [2011:09:05 15:01 +0100]: Okay, I misspoke here. It doesn't actually show all of the system plugins, but
it seems to show some? I would like to hear reports about how a vanilla Firefox
plugin list looks compared to our Firefox on users' systems, because although I
have access to a lot of VMs, none of them are tarted up with plugins right now.
Does it show none, some, or all? Is there any consistency to which ones you see?

* cgp3cg  [2011:09:06 07:52 +1000]: This is a change in Firefox 6.0.2 where they list them so they can explicitly
distrust them. If you click on Aurora->Preferences (or Options, I think, in
Windows)->View Certificates->then click on any of the DigiNotar things present,
it will say at the top "Explicitly Distrust [...]".
You can see some more of that here: This basically superseded our (and their) patches, and I think the reason there
are so many more listed is because they got all of them, including
intermediaries. To be honest, while Mozilla has been very helpful and
responsive to us, we don't have complete insight into their decision-making
processes so we are trusting them to do the right thing here, at least right
this minute with the given time-constraints. When things have settled down a
bit more we will probably revisit how TBB handles certs overall. In essence,
there has been a lot of turbulence with this release (which happened 2 weeks
early because of this mess, and then went through a bunch of rapid changes
immediately after) so everything is a bit wobbly.
We're going to be making some more radical changes and the build/QA team is
basically just me, for all platforms, except when other devs & volunteers pitch
in. Would you be interested in helping us out with better testing?

* David Carlson  [2011:09:07 06:06 -0700]: Hi David,
Can you try this bundle? I made it for Windows to fix this problem -- the
automatic port selection in the new bundles is causing a lot of trouble, and
you can use this until we put out the new TBBs with the fix:
It just changes two configuration files (torrc and vidalia.conf) to disable the
automatic port selection. The official bundles will be coming out tomorrow.

* Robert Ransom  [2012:04:04 10:44 +0000]: Agreed. As for now, I've re-signed the current tarball, but for the next
release the website will be updated to only refer to the git tag and tarballs
will be discontinued.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Firefox vs. Tor Browser Bundle release cycles 
* Al Billings  [2013:12:11 17:38 -0800]: To help clarify this situation a bit for everyone (since I have been making the
stable TBBs for 3+ years now): though we often had a rough idea of when a new
Firefox release was coming, we usually had no idea of the specific date and did
not have access to releases any earlier than everyone else. So as soon as
they'd come out, I would try to make sure everything was in order, build all
the stuff, then send things to QA, who almost always were given a full 24 hours
to look things over. (There are more release issues that would take time for me
to do -- writing up the blog post, syncing packages to the mirrors, etc, all of
which in total took more hours.)
I believe this situation is remedied since Mike is working more closely with
Mozilla people now and we often get a more specific heads up. We still don't
get access to the releases any earlier, though, so there will continue to be
some lag between the two for the foreseeable future.
Anyway, just wanted to explain why the releases didn't happen immediately. I
did try to get them out as soon as possible though. We hope to decrease that
much more going forward.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fraudulent PGP key with my email address (CEE1590D) 
Hello everyone,
I discovered that there is a key out there (CEE1590D) associated with my Tor
email address that is NOT me. I don't know who generated it, but I can think of
many nefarious or incompetent reasons why they might have done it.
This email is for two purposes:
1. To inform you that this is NOT MY KEY. Do not under any circumstances trust
anything that may have ever been signed or encrypted with this key. I looked
around and was unable to find anything, but nonetheless, it is out there and
that is creepy.
2. If anyone on any of these lists has encountered this key anywhere -- the
main fear being that it has been used to fraudulently sign packages of some
kind -- can you please let me/us know ASAP?
Tor Project official signatures are listed here: Consider that the canonical source for all signatures! Be suspicious of
anything not listed there and let us know if you ever find anything.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Another fake key for my email address 
Hi everyone,
In September last year I discovered a fake key for my torproject.org email
address[1]. Today I discovered another one:
pub   2048R/C458C590 2014-02-13 [expires: 2018-02-13]
      Key fingerprint = 106D 9243 7726 CD80 6A14  0F37 B00C 48E2 C458 C590
uid                  Erinn Clark sub   2048R/D16B3DB6 2014-02-13 [expires: 2018-02-13]
To reiterate what I said last time this happened:
1. That is NOT MY KEY. Do not under any circumstances trust anything that may
have ever been signed or encrypted with this key. I looked around and was
unable to find anything, but nonetheless, it is out there and that is creepy.
2. If anyone on any of these lists has encountered this key anywhere -- the
main fear being that it has been used to fraudulently sign packages of some
kind -- can you please let me/us know ASAP?
Tor Project official signatures are listed here: Consider that the canonical source for all signatures! Be suspicious of
anything not listed there and let us know if you ever find anything.
I want to note here that last year I created a new key which also belongs to me
and I just haven't switched to yet. I am not signing any Tor packages
whatsoever with this key, but it does belong to me and has several signatures
from people I've met in person, some of whom also signed my old/current
(63FEE659) key:
pub   4096R/91FCD12F 2013-09-21
      Key fingerprint = 724B 96C1 997A E999 F0C0  0F8A F8F4 9DD8 91FC D12F
uid                  Erinn Clark uid                  Erinn Clark uid                  Erinn Clark sub   4096R/1B749632 2013-09-21

@_subject: [tor-talk] Trac accounts and potential account compromise 
Dear Tor Trac users,
We learned on recently that there was a bug in our Trac setup that allowed
anyone to register a new user account for an existing user name, overwriting
the existing user's password and thereby taking over the account [0].
A workaround was quickly implemented by weasel to prevent new user registration
while we investigated how to re-enable it without encountering this problem
again. Soon after, our configuration was fixed to allow new registrations
without overwriting existing usernames.
However, it's still possible that somebody has taken over your account in the
past and you didn't notice because you didn't log in recently. We recommend
users try to login and if you find you are unable to do so, you can reset your
password here: We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you! Please feel free
to contact me with any questions.
Erinn & the rest of the Tor Trac team
