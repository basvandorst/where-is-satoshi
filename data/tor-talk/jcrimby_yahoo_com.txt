@_subject: [tor-talk] Better TBB about:config settings(?); 
I just made a new trac ticket for this topic. In case this e-mail does not appear properly formatted on TorTalk list, the trac ticket can be found here:  I have been testing the following about:config settings (specific to Firefox 6) for a couple of weeks. I have used very similar settings for TBB since Firefox v3.x.x. These settings do seem to (very noticeably) speed up browsing.
The only setting I think may do well with a bit of tweaking is nglayout.initialpaint.delay, I doubled the Firefox default of 250 ms. Doing so seems to (noticeably) decrease total page load time, while (unnoticeably) increasing time to first load on page.
I tried to test these settings in TBB vs. vanilla TBB but I don't know how to configure Tor to use the same circuit for all speed tests. I am very open to corrections and suggestions.
user_pref("layout.spellcheckDefault", 2);
user_pref("nglayout.initialpaint.delay", 500);
user_pref("browser.display.show_image_placeholders", false);
user_pref("content.notify.backoffcount", 5);
user_pref("content.notify.interval", 120000);
user_pref("content.max.tokenizing.time", 360000);
user_pref("content.notify.ontimer", true);
user_pref("content.interrupt.parsing", true);
user_pref("content.switch.threshold", 750000);
user_pref("network.dns.disableIPv6", true);
user_pref("network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-proxy", 16);
user_pref("network.http.max-connections-per-server", 16);
user_pref("network.http.keep-alive.timeout", 600);

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is the Hidden Wiki dead?! 
For some days (weeks?) the Hidden Wiki ( has been down. Does anyone know what's going on? Will it come back up soon? Are there other places that list many Hidden Services, besides the Hidden Wiki?

Well, it looks like _all_ HS are broken in TBB as of (at least) Tor v0.2.2.31-rc. None of the > 20 HS I tried to visit with TBB (Tor v0.2.2.31-rc) and TBB (Tor v0.2.2.32) will load. However, tested HSs do load via. Tor2Web.
I made a bug ticket here: "All tested Hidden Services unreachable via. TBB, but are reacable via. Tor2Web."

Arma was kind enough to bonk me on the head to point out the problem is one of timezone or clock or date. He was correct. My clock was over 180 minutes off (due to timezone issues). Hidden Services are working just fine. ... back to your regularly scheduled broadcasts ...
