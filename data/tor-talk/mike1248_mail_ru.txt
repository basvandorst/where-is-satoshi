I'm a newbie trying to setup a working Azureus (aka Vuze)-Tor pair. Unfortunately,I cannot achieve that. Reading the documentation and searching the Internet did not help. Here is what I have:
ALT Linux 4.1
Tor v0.2.2.35 built from sources
Azureus 3.0.4.2
$ cat /opt/tor/etc/tor/torrc
SafeLogging 0
The TOR log is attached
Can anybody help?
??? Michael
