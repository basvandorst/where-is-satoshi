I would like to report / discuss a strange thing. I run an up to date TorBB on debian, having its security settings to max, the noscript whitelist is empty, cookies & history cleared. Still, when accessing google.com via the webproxy zalmos.com, with a circuit ending in a third country I will be redirected to google.MYCOUNTRY and get ads displayed in MYLANGUAGE from that same site zalmos.com
Normally, I would expect google.EXIT-SERVER-COUNTRY to be loaded and have EXIT-SERVER-LANGUAGE ads.   So, the question is : since there seems evidence that zalmos can at least de-anonymize my country, HOW is that possible??  What can I do? Do you experience the same thing?
Thank you

Hi Allen,
that seems a plausible explanation. I got a bit parano without reason :)
Thank you!
