@_subject: No available nodes when trying to choose node 
I started up a node but get this message "No available nodes when trying to choose node. Failing."
When I look in my .tor/cached-routers.new file I see lots of routers to choose from.
Any ideas?

@_subject: 2-node circuits Vs 3-node circuits 
Is there really any difference in terms of anonymity and encryption between circuits containing 2 nodes or 3 nodes?
In a 2-node circuit, if someone is snooping node 1 they can see the IP address of the client but not the traffic and not the destination IP If you're snooping node 2 you can see the destination IP address but not the source.
If 3 really is better than 2, then why not use 4 or 5 to be even better?

I don't think people spying on network traffic could see this because of the outer TLS layer, but it does let node operators know that a client is at the other end of this circuit.
I think so.
I don't get how the end node can be not a tor node.

Anyone seen this message before:
Jun 20 19:03:39.222 [info] connection_dir_request_failed(): Giving up on directory server at '82.103.132.40:80'; retrying
Jun 20 19:03:39.240 [info] connection_dir_client_reached_eof(): Received http status code 503 ("Directory unavailable") from server '82.103.132.40:80'. I'll try again soon.
Strange this is, this node shows up in the cached-status files as Exit Fast Guard Stable Running Valid V2Dir with a pretty recent timestamp
Any ideas?

Thanks very much for your reply Roger.
Don't even get me started on information compartmentalization it'll get complicated very quickly.

When I logout of my yahoo mail account using Tor it jumps back to the same page. I'm using firefox with Tor 0.1.2.14 (package, not compiling) on Vista.
When I toggle torbutton I can logout OK.
Any ideas?

I'm not sure if this really happens, but if you have a connection open to an OR and a new circuit is required through it,
couldn't ORn-1 send a CREATE_FAST to ORn?

@_subject: OSI 1-3 attack on Tor? in it.wikipedia 
If the layer 1-3 attack is done in conjunction with malicious node ownership
how do you force the client to think it chose your path? Can you fake out
the onion keys of the routers the client thinks it's using?

The italian description is a bit cryptic, but essentially it is about
faking IP address and changing routing accordingly near the user. This
can be done with many techiques, and an ISP is obviously capable to do
it without difficulty. It could be done in a man in the middle fashion
or by faking a small Tor network .... BUT, such an attack should be
handled by the fingerprints and the initial TLS hadshakes. The
fingerprints are part of the distribution and can't be faked without the
private key of the Tor node, I suppose. Of course all this with the
condition that the Tor client's integrity is guaranteed (but without
that nothing protects you :).

Hi, all!
I'll be in San Francisco for most of this week, and I thought it would be
neat to have a Tor Folks meetup on Thursday, probably in the late afternoon
or early evening.  Let me know (off-list) if there's any interest, and I'll
figure out where -- probably a coffee shop or something.

@_subject: How do we defeat exit node sniffing? 
You can't be sure that traffic between an exit node and your target URL is
not being sniffed unless you know the complete physical path between the two
which is unlikely right? Sure you could implement some scheme other than TLS
to authenticate the server but that doesn't stop you being sniffed. You
could implement some other kind of encryption between you and the target
server so that sniffing is not a problem, in that case you'd just being
using tor for anonymity, not encryption. Behalf Of defcon

so what do you all suggest if I must authenticate to a non ssl connection?
How do I do it anonymously and safely?
Prefer TLS-enabled services, and mind the authenticity of server certs.
Or use Tor hidden services.

Did you put the info about your authoritative directory servers into
config.c? You may need to run the them first to generate the fingerprints.
Have you looked at the IP addresses your ORs are publishing to?

Hey everyone,
   Our research team is a bit stuck on a problem of bootstrapping  generic Tor on a private network in planetlab.  The two authoritative  directory servers that we are running continuously complain that,
Nov 10 12:22:35.487 [info] router_pick_trusteddirserver(): No trusted  dirservers are reachable. Trying them all again.
Nov 10 12:22:35.487 [info] router_pick_directory_server(): No  reachable router entries for dirservers. Trying them all again.
Nov 10 12:22:35.487 [info] directory_get_from_dirserver(): No router  found for consensus network-status fetch; falling back to dirserver  Nov 10 12:22:35.487 [info] router_pick_trusteddirserver(): No trusted  dirservers are reachable. Trying them all again.
Nov 10 12:22:35.487 [notice] While fetching directory info, no running  dirservers known. Will try again later. (purpose 14)
However, OR's in the network seem to think that they are publishing  their descriptors without any problem.  When we attempt to browse to   into the Dir port of either of the two  authoritative dir servers, it consistently responds with zero content  - we are assuming this is why clients are OR's are not yet  communicating with each other.  We've attempted this setup on both V1  and V2 dir servers.
We have exhausted the specific guidance for running a private Tor  network found here:
Any comments, suggestions, ideas, or guidance would be most  appreciated.  :)

Any packet could be part of an attack. The same packet in different situations can cause many different effects, depending on how the system has already been setup, by admins AND attackers.
It depends on the knowledge of the entity that sent the packet, how many more of them there are and stuff like that. But yeah a specific hex pattern being a militarized whatever is bullshit.

If one organization does this, how does that have any affect the next?
And if it has no affect and many orgs are doing it the number of controlled circuits increases.
