Yeah, let's go to FIDO! :)
The more you wait (without Internet), the more servers will be updated less likely that you'll find yourself a victim of this vulnerability in OpenSSL. But now this will probably never be zero. So relax and be happy

What's wrong with communism? One-third of my life I lived in USSR. With all the negative aspects of the regime that was in the Soviet Union, I want to tell you about the three things that I perceive as the abnormal, but which were the norms, when my country rush into capitalism:
1. Misery. The first time I gave alms in the early 90s in Moscow. I
vividly remember this moment, because at that time my father had to
explain to me what the heck is going on and why these people are sitting
and begging for money. We did not know that this is the norm.
2. Education. We did not know that education may not be available to
someone or that it can be paid and unequal access. My grandfather was
educated at BMSTU (it's something like the US's MIT). Free. He was from rural areas. Today, to get an education at this university, you must be either a genius or rich or have a clout.
3. Paid health care. My parents visit only private clinics. We visit only paid dentists. My sister gave birth in a private room and she was submitted by individual nurse. It is good that we have money. Yes, I
forgot to say that my family is on average much wealthier than the
general population of Russia. Last week I bought 300 square meters of
office space in the city center. Eighteen months later, I'm counting my
welfare increase in the half. ..Paid health - nonsense. All people
should have equal access to health care. Totaly free.
Give people three things: food, warmth and shelter. And you do not have
to call for help to the United States to combat the evil and dangerous

banned TOR network.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Escape NSA just to enter commercial surveillance? 
I'm absolutly agree with this point of view. Even more, in today world,
I think, greatest danger *for most people* comes from corporations like Google, Facebook, Twitter etc whose money - our privacy, not from NSA/GCHQ/FSB/...
The latter, in theory, in democratic countries, called to serve the good
of the people. The first - serve their pockets.
I think, in crypto-privacy-tor-i2p-... communities this problem is very
underrated. The main enemy - NSA & Co., not the companies whose main goals
are our desires, preferences, dreams, pain and suffering - those things through which we easily manipulated.
Facebook and Co. have enough power and money to manipulate/lobby their
interests. I don't think they need any support from Tor developers.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Has anyone HEARD from IOError since his last tweet? 
I think he in custody now with all such accusations. So why worry?
Also how would you have behaved in his place with all such arguments from both sides? Of course you would be silent. It is right decision in my poin of view.
I don't stand for any sides. We don't have any evidence. It is work for
Germany's LE. So let they do their work. And after we see result - it make sense to discuss something.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Which reputable webmail providers function well with 
Exactly my thoughts. Duckduckgo and other services under US jurisdiction
*by law* saving logs, mails etc.
.and now in the latest release of TBB we have DuckDuckGo as search engine
by default
