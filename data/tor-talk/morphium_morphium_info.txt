Yes, I wanted to use a Server with GBit-Link dedicated for tor.
(When) will multi-cpu-support be implemented? (So that I could provide at least 320 MBit instead of 80).

@_subject: Tor consuming much CPU & RAM (?) 
Hi, i sadly have to tell you that I have to limit my server "morphium" to following:
BandwidthRate 1000 KB
BandwidthBurst 1500 KB
But: Its not due to bandwith. If i increase that values, the server load raises above 1, from now 0.1 or something.
I have an Intel Pentium 4 3.20GHz and 2 gigabytes of ram, so I don't understand why tor is so bad for my load.
If this is a Bug, I would be glad to get an update :)
If this is known (because tor needs the time for the crypto things) its okey, but i hope you understand that this slows down the network. I think there are many "older" machines, with much bandwith, but if the CPU cant handle the requests, tor is loosing bandwith.
Best regards,

@_subject: Anonymity easily thwarted by flooding network with relays? 
How? If you have, lets say, 100 nodes in the Network, and 2 of them
are owned by you, your chance is 2 in 100 to be used as entry node and
2 in 100 to be used as exit node (simplified).
So the chance that you have entry AND exit node for 1 connection is
2/100 * 2/100, which is 4 in 10.000.
No matter how long the path between entry and exit node is.
On the problem in general I think, that it may be possible for 1
Attacker to put up a lot of servers, BUT if one government starts
doing this, I think, another government will, too.
So no one will hold more than 90% of the nodes, I guess not even more
than 50%, because we don't only have 2 large governments in this world

@_subject: [tor-talk] Possible Attack on Tor speed? 
I just had an idea, how an attacker could slow down the Tor network,
and wanted it to discuss with you.
To my knowledge, there is only the BadExit and BadDirectory flag,
nothing like BadNode.
In contrast to a bad exit, which is misbehaving, how could the network
block a node, which has all outgoing traffic blocked?
Lets say, I set up some (few hundred or so) Nodes, which I start up
and then block outgoing traffic on them. If they're chosen as middle
node for a circuit, the circuit can't build, because the next server
cannot be reached.
If my servers advertise a high bandwidth (is there any detection for
false bandwidth advertisings?), Tor will often try to put them in a
circuit, and often will fail. This could lead to no usable circuit for
several minutes.
Let me know what you think!
Thanks :)

Do you have any sources for this? I am running a Tor Exit vserver on

sometimes one a week), answer everytime to the complainer and to
hetzner that it's a Tor server and didn't have any problems yet. But
it's not running that long yet (~2 months).
I also asked hetzner support yesterday, they answered me that its
neither forbidden in their terms of services nor in their system
policies, and to their knowledge it doesn't conflict with german law,
so it's perfectly fine with them.
(german quote for german readers: "In den AGB und System Policies ist

TOR auch nicht gegen Deutsches Recht. Von daher sollte sich die Frage

2011/2/4 Matthew :
It happened 4 years ago... they came, took every hardware they could
find, took more than a year to analyze it, they found nothing (they
were looking for child pornography - someone downloaded via my tor
exit from swoopshare) and gave my hardware back after 2 years.
The trial is still ongoing, but there has only been 1 day in court
(about a year ago), the judge acknowledged that he doesnt understand
what we explained about Tor and such, said he wants an assessor, and
we'll see again in about 8 weeks (a year ago!).
My lawyer now asked 2 or 3 times at the court, when & how we'll
continue, but didn't get a response yet. Doesn't seem like the judge
wants to carry on fast.
(I also got letters from the federal police asking who had my Tor IP
at a specific point in time, got heard at the police (You are not
required to say anything at the german police, but I preferred to take
a laptop there and show them what Tor is and how it works - they
appreciated that [and I lowered my risk of getting raided another time
;) ]) and such things).

Oh and yes, they took only my hardware @ home, not the Server in the
data center that actually DID run Tor and that the "bad" IP belonged

I think they will have to pay compensation after I got my acquittal.
But that has to be checked afterwards.
And, if the case continues at it current ... speed ..., this can be in
3, 5 or 10 years.

Yeah, true. They asked my provider: "who owns this IP: xxx" and my

2011/1/30 Damian Johnson :
That was really dumb, as it puts a lot more load on the Nodes that
support encryption, and, as was mentioned before, _every_ operator
could sniff.
I will change my Exit Policy now to something like 80, 6667, 21 and if
you BadExit it, you'll loose another fast node.

@_subject: Is "gatereloaded" a Bad Exit? 
As I stated above, it's not a good idea to BadExit them, because it
puts more load on the servers, that DO support https i.e. - and makes
them slower.
Those weren't 10K/s Nodes you blacklisted there, they've been really
fast Exit Nodes.
And I don't see ANY point in BadExit'ing 5 "random" Nodes, suggesting
that no one could capture your unencrypted traffic now.
This is just further slowing down the whole Tor-Network.

Sniffing is worse than loosing bandwidth, right. But sniffing still
occurs, we just don't know where. And we can't tell wether they did.
I think concluding "only 80: he is sniffing" is wrong (and even would
be "80 and 443: he is a good guy").
And if those nodes really are ran by "the bad guys", I don't think
it's a problem for them now to setup a new node on a new subnet that
allows their old ports + 443 and continue sniffing.
I can not see the Tor project won _anything_ with this decision.

So, to summarize that, you are saying to every operator that is not
your opinion: We (as the Tor project) don't need you.
Thats... pretty arrogant.
Or am I mis-understanding you?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Check wether IP has been a Tor node 
2011/9/9 Roger Dingledine :
Thanks for the response. I wonder why I didn't find that via google, I
searched for "check IP was tor exit" and such.
Also now googling for "check whether some IP address was a Tor relay"
- which is pretty similar to the string on exonerator page: "or: a
website that tells you whether some IP address was a Tor relay"
doesn't lead me to a result on the first 5 pages (google).
Could we include that in the FAQ (if it is already, I did not find it
easy enough) and make it available for search enignes in a better way?
(i.e. robots.txt is missing - that shouldnt stop engines from
crawling, but probably it's better if one is there, allowing
everything? I don't know).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Idiotical abuses against Tor-servers 
2011/9/22 Orionjur Tor-admin :
Just for your information: We at torservers.net are getting several of
this reports per day (about 10-20), we tried to explain what Tor is,
how they could recognize Tor traffic and that we could, if they want
it, exclude their IPs from our Exit Nodes.
They didn't reply to that.
A few weeks afterwards we asked, wether they could stop their reports
for our IPs, they just replied "[We] think the TOR activity from your
network is highly suspicious and you should do something about it."
Since that, we're ignoring their reports, and nothing more has happened.
I think they're automatically spamming like BayTSP, and deserve to be ignored.

@_subject: [tor-talk] [Need quick help] 30+ mbps node taken down by host 
you are right, SMTP is blocked by default. But people can i.e. access
hotmail.com via webinterface (where your IP is then put into the mail
as originating IP aswell) or use SMTP on secure ports (but that mostly
comes with authentication, I guess).
You should ask your provider to get the mail headers of the spam, to
see how exactly it was done, and then maybe block i.e. exit to the
hotmail IPs, if it was sent via hotmail webinterface (to show them you
are doing something).
