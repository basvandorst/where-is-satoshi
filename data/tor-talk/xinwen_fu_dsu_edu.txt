The information helps a lot. New questions :).
What is the algorithm for generating the file "cached-routers" for a Tor
client? Why cannot I find a running router's information in this file
while I can find it in the folder "cached-status"?
It may take a long time for a new router (or a restarting router) to
appear in "cached-routers". Is there a way to force new router
information into "cached-routers"?
Thanks a lot!

Now that I can break my silence it's time for some action.
A question to all Tor-operators:
I'd like to do a survey about all incidents which happened to
operators. Stuff like:
* arrested
* confiscated equippment
* nastygram
* surveillance
* ...
What would be possible other questions/point in the survey?
