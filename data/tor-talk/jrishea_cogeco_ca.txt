I laugh when they just pinpoint the source of ANY internet  transmission at the snap of their fingers in those shows. I always  thought to myself "I'd like to see that work against Tor!" Heck, if I  was a criminal... *shifty eyes*..... I'd at least use something to  cover my tracks, they make it look like no one does. It's good to see  fantasy catch up with reality once in awhile! =)

@_subject: How can I trust all my Tor nodes in path 
Here's a thought... I was contemplating the ramifications of, say an  exit node designed purely to log traffic directed through it. Assume  the most malicious intent here too. Listening to every frame that  comes out, you're bound to find something that leaks information. Has  anyone considered a concept of listening on the client end and  scrubbing anything that could identify (at least, electronically)  you. Maybe there's a privoxy configuration or even something like a  snort rule.
Has anyone given thought to some Tor-based snort rules? We could make  at least outbound trivial into leaks (exact text of IP address,  hostname, etc.) and detection of generic Tor traffic.

It's exactly right though! This has got to be the only good use of  Trusted Computing I've ever seen!
Basically you know, and I know, precisely what's running on the  machine. Say we share the secret keys of the tor nodes, they'd be  guaranteed to be running a known, non-logging version of Tor!

@_subject: DNS 
I think what he's after is not an application, but the redirection  and/or proxying of DNS requests en masse. For example, lets say you'd  implement this functionality where your router is, that way it would  ensure there's no DNS leaks, as well as provide DNS caching service  for the whole family, in addition to Tor and possibly other proxies.
