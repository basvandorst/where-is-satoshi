@_subject: Tor Hardware Router (Tor in a box) 
I'm running tor on VIA C3 (1GHz), serving about 500-1000kbytes/sec.
It's working fine without CPU fan, but I think it's too hot for appliances since it gets more than 60 degrees Celsius.

1 min. load average is somewhere around 1 with tor 0.1.0.x.
(Services except for tor is almost always asleep :-) )
FYI, it was 2 when it was running tor 0.0.9.x.
I've never run tor with other machine, since this is the only
machine that has global IP. I wish had other machines though.
