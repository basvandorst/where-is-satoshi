@_subject: I am at my wits end, I cant register for account at digg.com using tor 
I followed all the instructions for installing tor on
Ubuntu.  Now I can't register at digg.com.  I tried
every option I could think of to make it work but no
go.  Can anybody tell me what to do so I can use tor
and sign up for digg.com
