This happens for me from time to time. I run XFCE.
Just locate the Process Manager in the system menu, find the firefox/TBB process and kill it. I normally just go to the command line, start up top find the process and kill it from there. Launch the TBB again, this time it should launch and the window will appear.

I use Twidere (loaded from f-droid) and Orbot (loaded from f-droid) with no lock-out as of yet, even over multiple twitter accounts.

Are people who are having their accounts locked out on a regular basis using two-factor? I wonder if two-factor is turned on does it make a difference?
