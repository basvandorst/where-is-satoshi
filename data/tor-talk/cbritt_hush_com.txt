@_subject: [tor-talk] unregister exit relay - how to 
This is why it is recommended that you not commingle the tor exit
relay data and your personal traffic on the same IP.
Do you have a static or dynamic IP address? Please also consider the
possible consequences of running an exit relay from your house...
Hi to all,
Few days ago I have tried to setup an exit relay on my home laptop ..
with great success :)
The bad part is after seeing my external ip address published to the
world on atlas or globe I have discovered I cannot access anymore to
some site with my payed premium login credential because the sites
policy don't allow  access from the tor network even if I don't use a
tor client to browse the net. :(
For this reason I stopped my exit relay, but to solve the problem I
need to unregister my external ip from the public list as well.
How can I do that?
The relay id is: relisys
Someone can help me please?
P Please consider the environment before printing this e-mail

Assuming seperate modem, WAN IP changes when MAC of first device after
 (either router or regular computer) changes.  Some router firmwares allow you to change the WAN side MAC which of course results in
another  IP address being assigned; bear in mind if you do this a
modem reboot is  required.
You could call Virgin and ask them to release your DHCP reservation
and reboot your router/modem afterwards. Otherwise, try turning it off
for 12/24 hours and see if that works. Yes you are right, now I
My ip is dynamic but is changed quite rarely, and reboot the router
99% of the times doesn't affect it.
That's is why I'm looking for a different approach.
