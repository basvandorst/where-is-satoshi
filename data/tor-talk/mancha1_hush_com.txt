@_subject: [tor-talk] "Torifier" for Windows 
Is there a Tor Project sanctioned method to "torify"
applications on Windows?
On systems such as Linux there are wrappers like torify
and torsocks. Windows does have some functional pseudo
equivalents like FreeCap and other proprietary/closed
I am wondering if anyone has worked on something that can
torify command line (say via Cygwin) or if the Tor project
has a recommended method for torifying applications that
lack native SOCKS support.

Hello Fabio.
Thank you for the link to the ML thread and TorCap2 source.
I have successfully compiled it on Cygwin for appropriate
definitions of "successfully".
TorCap2 builds and runs but when the target application is
launched it connects directly (rather than through the
specified socks proxy). For any of you Cygwin experts, any
ideas why the Cygwin-compiled version is not wrapping the
Winsock API?
 Thanks for the TorCap link (which I understand is
the conceptual motivation for TorCap2). I might take a look
at compiling this in Lazarus at some point.
 N: Thanks for mentioning Proxifier but I am only
looking for open-source solutions at this point.
 Goulet: That sounds very promising. Certainly a
functional equivalent to torsocks for Windows would be very
welcome. I hope you're able to enlist people with the needed
Windows networking skills.
