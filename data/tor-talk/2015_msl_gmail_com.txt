Hash: SHA512
Hello everyone,
I am using Tor Birdy 0.1.4 and it is failing to download public
keys from servers. It is configured with defaults.
I have to disable Tor Birdy to download a key and re-enable it
when done.
Does anyone know a solution ?
Thank you,

First of all, thank you all for your prompt answer. I tried all
of your suggestions, the one that worked for me was Ivan Markins'
The one related to the clipboard didn't work, because it was a
partially signed message, I think.
I installed gnupg-curl, and I am having the right version, but
still doesn't work.
Cheers !

I understand, from a post to this list, than tor is switching from RSA
to elliptic curve key generation.
What would we expect from that update ?
Thanks for everyone's effort

Pretty reassuring and comforting. :))

Maybe "anonymous file storage" is a better subject ?
I'm posting it on tor-talk too, and we can follow the
discussion there.
And back to the topic, maybe it would be possible to
set up a pilot-test so one could see how many use
cases free haven could properly solve.
If I didn't understand from "freehaven.net", just cyphering
and splitting a file among many servers could be useful.

Thanks for the information, pretty useful.
I have visited Tahoe-LAFS, seems interesting.
I couldn't contact "Aktie" however,
maybe they block tor connections ?
We should discuss it at "tor-talk",
moderators could tell us we are off-topic.
