@_subject: Tor 0.2.0.22-rc is out 
1. I am behind a National Firewall. This means:
a) All Tor download sites are blocked (but the block
can be circumvented using Tor)
b) Tor cannot easily 'bootstrap,' since the
authoritative directory servers are all blocked.
I managed to get Tor running and tried to download
some bridges, but only got one on the website, and got
none via (Yahoo) e-mail.
If I click on 'Use Bridges' with only the one bridge,
Tor can't bootstrap.
If I do not click on 'Use Bridges,' Tor could
bootstrap before, but cannot bootstrap now.
Any suggestions?

The hard-working people at the firewall have managed
to block every open proxy I'd been able to find in the
past. If it's listed on any site that says it's
listing 'open proxies,' it's blocked. Keeping Tor
running was my last way around the firewall. I managed
to download an early version of Tor when it was easier
to find open proxies, then used Tor to keep Tor
I'm not sure why I can't get bridges at this e-mail
address, or (last Wednesday when Tor was running) by
accessing bridges.torproject.org. I only got a single
bridge, not a list, and the same bridge when I
refreshed. If I checked 'use bridges' in Vidalia, Tor
could not open a circuit using just the one bridge. So
I unchecked the 'My ISB blocks Tor' button in Vidalia,
and Tor built a circuit from the information it
already had.
Now, with Tor unable to build a circuit, the site to
get bridges is, of course, blocked.
I'm running 0.2.0.23-rc on Darwin, and 0.2.0.22-rc on
XP. Both were able to create a circuit Wednesday, but
neither can create a circuit today.
A few weeks ago, when I downloaded 0.2.0.22-rc, I got
about six bridges on the XP machine, but didn't bother
(since it was working without them) on the Darwin
machine. But now neither machine can build a circuit.
According to an old, but still unblocked post, they
use the SmartFilter filtering software.
This is a Middle-East firewall that uses a US firm
that provides them a list of every known site on the
Internet (all numerical IP addresses are blocked, so
only named sites can be accessed). All sites in the
categories 'porn,' 'political,' and 'hacking' are
blocked. Some sites seem to be manually blocked as
well (e.g., several blogs about the country) that
probably aren't in any category on the US provider's
About two years ago, I could leave Tor off for a
couple of weeks, but it could bootstrap itself. Then
one day it couldn't, since (I assume) the
authoritative servers had been put on the list of
'hacking' sites. I managed (after a week or so) to
find a way to re-bootstrap (I hacked the code to use
month-old network descriptors) and have been careful
to keep Tor running at least an hour a day ever since
to keep the network descriptors up to date.
The message I'm getting now is: Apr 04 10:35:12.277
[Notice] Tried for 120 seconds to get a connection to
geoip.vidalia-project.net:1443. Giving up. (waiting

I started with 70 usable descriptors, but that number
has been steadily dropping as I've watched, to 68,
then 65, and now 59.
I've noticed that I can't go back to 0.1.0.19, since
the old cached-status directory has been deleted by

@_subject: Tor 0.2.0.23-rc problems resolved? 
Yesterday, I wrote that my copy of Tor was suddenly unable to download relays or to complete a circuit. Scott sent me a new consensus document, but this didn't help. In fact, after putting it in, Vidalia began cycling, taking excessive memory and cpu cycles. I terminated it and restarted, but then Vidalia started demanding a password before it would start Tor.
I decided to re-install Vidalia Bundle 0.2.0.23-rc, but this didn't help. I backed up all the Tor data files, and deleted them, then did another re-install. Still no help.
The re-installs kept insisting that they were upgrades, even though I'd run the uninstaller script and had tried to delete all Tor and Vidalia files.
Then I noticed that I still had the Vidalia app, so I deleted that and all data files and directories I could find.
The last re-install still said it was an upgrade, but, after performing it, Tor downloaded 1400 relays and built a circuit, so the problem was a corrupt Vidalia.app
Apparently, re-install tries not to overwrite files, and the Tor uninstall package does not delete Vidalia.app, so it took me some time to narrow the problem to a corrupt vidalia.app running in the Darwin applications directory.
But after the final re-install, Tor managed to bootstrap itself and now seems to be working.
I post this in case it provides any information to the Tor project team.

@_subject: tor and google-error 
This isn't just a Tor error. I live in a country where I was told the National ISP has just 768 IP addresses for several million subscribers, so we are all on various LANs or MANs sharing the IP addresses. Anti-virus software is rare here, but trying to surf banned websites (or subscribing to dodgy mailing lists) is common, with the result that many of the computers sharing my IP address are, in fact infected.
Sometimes I get the Google capcha, sometimes I get the message below, and sometimes switching to Tor allows me to reach Google when a direct connection is blocked.
With Tor, at least one can try switching to a different exit node, which sometimes works. With our ISP, I can switch to a different LAN address by disconnecting and re-connecting, but my external address generally remains the same, and therefore remains blocked.

prompts for password until I hit cancel.

@_subject: [Fwd: Tor 0.2.1.18 and 0.2.1.19 are released] 
Since downloading and installing the OS X universal .dmg package for 0.2.1.19, I keep getting the warning:
Aug 21 10:47:32.305 [Warning] Controller used obsolete addr-mappings/ GETINFO key; use address-mappings/ instead.
I'm not sure if this is Tor, or if the error is generated by hiccups in the new high-speed fibre-to-the-PC Internet connection installed by my (government) ISP (without my asking) (iTunes, which does not go through Tor, sometimes indicates that it was unable to check for podcasts, but I'm not sure if the lack of overall connectivity occurs at the same time that Tor posts the above warning.)
For those who didn't see the announcement, we have a new stable release
based on the 0.2.1.x codebase.
-------- Original Message --------
Tor 0.2.1.18 lays the foundations for performance improvements, adds
status events to help users diagnose bootstrap problems, adds optional
authentication/authorization for hidden services, fixes a variety of
potential anonymity problems, and includes a huge pile of other features
and bug fixes.
Tor 0.2.1.19 fixes a major bug with accessing and providing hidden
Changes in version 0.2.1.19 - 2009-07-28
? o Major bugfixes:
? ? - Make accessing hidden services on 0.2.1.x work right again.
? ? ? Bugfix on 0.2.1.3-alpha; workaround for bug 1038. Diagnosis and
? ? ? part of patch provided by "optimist".
? o Minor features:
? ? - When a relay/bridge is writing out its identity key fingerprint to
? ? ? the "fingerprint" file and to its logs, write it without spaces. Now
? ? ? it will look like the fingerprints in our bridges documentation,
? ? ? and confuse fewer users.
? o Minor bugfixes:
? ? - Relays no longer publish a new server descriptor if they change
? ? ? their MaxAdvertisedBandwidth config option but it doesn't end up
? ? ? changing their advertised bandwidth numbers. Bugfix on 0.2.0.28-rc;
? ? ? fixes bug 1026. Patch from Sebastian.
? ? - Avoid leaking memory every time we get a create cell but we have
? ? ? so many already queued that we refuse it. Bugfix on 0.2.0.19-alpha;
? ? ? fixes bug 1034. Reported by BarkerJr.
Changes in version 0.2.1.18 - 2009-07-24
? o Major features (clients):
? ? - Start sending "bootstrap phase" status events to the controller,
? ? ? so it can keep the user informed of progress fetching directory
? ? ? information and establishing circuits. Also inform the controller
? ? ? if we think we're stuck at a particular bootstrap phase. Implements
? ? ? proposal 137.
? ? - Clients replace entry guards that were chosen more than a few months
? ? ? ago. This change should significantly improve client performance,
? ? ? especially once more people upgrade, since relays that have been
? ? ? a guard for a long time are currently overloaded.
? ? - Network status consensus documents and votes now contain bandwidth
? ? ? information for each relay. Clients use the bandwidth values
? ? ? in the consensus, rather than the bandwidth values in each
? ? ? relay descriptor. This approach opens the door to more accurate
? ? ? bandwidth estimates once the directory authorities start doing
? ? ? active measurements. Implements part of proposal 141.
? o Major features (relays):
? ? - Disable and refactor some debugging checks that forced a linear scan
? ? ? over the whole server-side DNS cache. These accounted for over 50%
? ? ? of CPU time on a relatively busy exit node's gprof profile. Also,
? ? ? disable some debugging checks that appeared in exit node profile
? ? ? data. Found by Jacob.
? ? - New DirPortFrontPage option that takes an html file and publishes
? ? ? it as "/" on the DirPort. Now relay operators can provide a
? ? ? disclaimer without needing to set up a separate webserver. There's
? ? ? a sample disclaimer in contrib/tor-exit-notice.html.
? o Major features (hidden services):
? ? - Make it possible to build hidden services that only certain clients
? ? ? are allowed to connect to. This is enforced at several points,
? ? ? so that unauthorized clients are unable to send INTRODUCE cells
? ? ? to the service, or even (depending on the type of authentication)
? ? ? to learn introduction points. This feature raises the bar for
? ? ? certain kinds of active attacks against hidden services. Design
? ? ? and code by Karsten Loesing. Implements proposal 121.
? ? - Relays now store and serve v2 hidden service descriptors by default,
? ? ? i.e., the new default value for HidServDirectoryV2 is 1. This is
? ? ? the last step in proposal 114, which aims to make hidden service
? ? ? lookups more reliable.
? o Major features (path selection):
? ? - ExitNodes and Exclude*Nodes config options now allow you to restrict
? ? ? by country code ("{US}") or IP address or address pattern
? ? ? ("255.128.0.0/16"). Patch from Robert Hogan. It still needs some
? ? ? refinement to decide what config options should take priority if
? ? ? you ask to both use a particular node and exclude it.
? o Major features (misc):
? ? - When building a consensus, do not include routers that are down.
? ? ? This cuts down 30% to 40% on consensus size. Implements proposal
? ? ? 138.
? ? - New TestingTorNetwork config option to allow adjustment of
? ? ? previously constant values that could slow bootstrapping. Implements
? ? ? proposal 135. Patch from Karsten.
? ? - Convert many internal address representations to optionally hold
? ? ? IPv6 addresses. Generate and accept IPv6 addresses in many protocol
? ? ? elements. Make resolver code handle nameservers located at IPv6
? ? ? addresses.
? ? - More work on making our TLS handshake blend in: modify the list
? ? ? of ciphers advertised by OpenSSL in client mode to even more
? ? ? closely resemble a common web browser. We cheat a little so that
? ? ? we can advertise ciphers that the locally installed OpenSSL doesn't
? ? ? know about.
? ? - Use the TLS1 hostname extension to more closely resemble browser
? ? ? behavior.
? o Security fixes (anonymity/entropy):
? ? - Never use a connection with a mismatched address to extend a
? ? ? circuit, unless that connection is canonical. A canonical
? ? ? connection is one whose address is authenticated by the router's
? ? ? identity key, either in a NETINFO cell or in a router descriptor.
? ? - Implement most of proposal 110: The first K cells to be sent
? ? ? along a circuit are marked as special "early" cells; only K "early"
? ? ? cells will be allowed. Once this code is universal, we can block
? ? ? certain kinds of denial-of-service attack by requiring that EXTEND
? ? ? commands must be sent using an "early" cell.
? ? - Resume using OpenSSL's RAND_poll() for better (and more portable)
? ? ? cross-platform entropy collection again. We used to use it, then
? ? ? stopped using it because of a bug that could crash systems that
? ? ? called RAND_poll when they had a lot of fds open. It looks like the
? ? ? bug got fixed in late 2006. Our new behavior is to call RAND_poll()
? ? ? at startup, and to call RAND_poll() when we reseed later only if
? ? ? we have a non-buggy OpenSSL version.
? ? - When the client is choosing entry guards, now it selects at most
? ? ? one guard from a given relay family. Otherwise we could end up with
? ? ? all of our entry points into the network run by the same operator.
? ? ? Suggested by Camilo Viecco. Fix on 0.1.1.11-alpha.
? ? - Do not use or believe expired v3 authority certificates. Patch
? ? ? from Karsten. Bugfix in 0.2.0.x. Fixes bug 851.
? ? - Drop begin cells to a hidden service if they come from the middle
? ? ? of a circuit. Patch from lark.
? ? - When we erroneously receive two EXTEND cells for the same circuit
? ? ? ID on the same connection, drop the second. Patch from lark.
? ? - Authorities now vote for the Stable flag for any router whose
? ? ? weighted MTBF is at least 5 days, regardless of the mean MTBF.
? ? - Clients now never report any stream end reason except 'MISC'.
? ? ? Implements proposal 148.
? o Major bugfixes (crashes):
? ? - Parse dates and IPv4 addresses in a locale- and libc-independent
? ? ? manner, to avoid platform-dependent behavior on malformed input.
? ? - Fix a crash that occurs on exit nodes when a nameserver request
? ? ? timed out. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha; our CLEAR debugging code had
? ? ? been suppressing the bug since 0.1.2.10-alpha. Partial fix for
? ? ? bug 929.
? ? - Do not assume that a stack-allocated character array will be
? ? ? 64-bit aligned on platforms that demand that uint64_t access is
? ? ? aligned. Possible fix for bug 604.
? ? - Resolve a very rare crash bug that could occur when the user forced
? ? ? a nameserver reconfiguration during the middle of a nameserver
? ? ? probe. Fixes bug 526. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha.
? ? - Avoid a "0 divided by 0" calculation when calculating router uptime
? ? ? at directory authorities. Bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha.
? ? - Fix an assertion bug in parsing policy-related options; possible fix
? ? ? for bug 811.
? ? - Rate-limit too-many-sockets messages: when they happen, they happen
? ? ? a lot and end up filling up the disk. Resolves bug 748.
? ? - Fix a race condition that could cause crashes or memory corruption
? ? ? when running as a server with a controller listening for log
? ? ? messages.
? ? - Avoid crashing when we have a policy specified in a DirPolicy or
? ? ? SocksPolicy or ReachableAddresses option with ports set on it,
? ? ? and we re-load the policy. May fix bug 996.
? ? - Fix an assertion failure on 64-bit platforms when we allocated
? ? ? memory right up to the end of a memarea, then realigned the memory
? ? ? one step beyond the end. Fixes a possible cause of bug 930.
? ? - Protect the count of open sockets with a mutex, so we can't
? ? ? corrupt it when two threads are closing or opening sockets at once.
? ? ? Fix for bug 939. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.
? o Major bugfixes (clients):
? ? - Discard router descriptors as we load them if they are more than
? ? ? five days old. Otherwise if Tor is off for a long time and then
? ? ? starts with cached descriptors, it will try to use the onion keys
? ? ? in those obsolete descriptors when building circuits. Fixes bug 887.
? ? - When we choose to abandon a new entry guard because we think our
? ? ? older ones might be better, close any circuits pending on that
? ? ? new entry guard connection. This fix should make us recover much
? ? ? faster when our network is down and then comes back. Bugfix on
? ? ? 0.1.2.8-beta; found by lodger.
? ? - When Tor clients restart after 1-5 days, they discard all their
? ? ? cached descriptors as too old, but they still use the cached
? ? ? consensus document. This approach is good for robustness, but
? ? ? bad for performance: since they don't know any bandwidths, they
? ? ? end up choosing at random rather than weighting their choice by
? ? ? speed. Fixed by the above feature of putting bandwidths in the
? ? ? consensus.
? o Major bugfixes (relays):
? ? - Relays were falling out of the networkstatus consensus for
? ? ? part of a day if they changed their local config but the
? ? ? authorities discarded their new descriptor as "not sufficiently
? ? ? different". Now directory authorities accept a descriptor as changed
? ? ? if BandwidthRate or BandwidthBurst changed. Partial fix for bug 962;
? ? ? patch by Sebastian.
? ? - Ensure that two circuits can never exist on the same connection
? ? ? with the same circuit ID, even if one is marked for close. This
? ? ? is conceivably a bugfix for bug 779; fixes a bug on 0.1.0.4-rc.
? ? - Directory authorities were neglecting to mark relays down in their
? ? ? internal histories if the relays fall off the routerlist without
? ? ? ever being found unreachable. So there were relays in the histories
? ? ? that haven't been seen for eight months, and are listed as being
? ? ? up for eight months. This wreaked havoc on the "median wfu" and
? ? ? "median mtbf" calculations, in turn making Guard and Stable flags
? ? ? wrong, hurting network performance. Fixes bugs 696 and 969. Bugfix
? ? ? on 0.2.0.6-alpha.
? o Major bugfixes (hidden services):
? ? - When establishing a hidden service, introduction points that
? ? ? originate from cannibalized circuits were completely ignored
? ? ? and not included in rendezvous service descriptors. This might
? ? ? have been another reason for delay in making a hidden service
? ? ? available. Bugfix from long ago (0.0.9.x?)
? o Major bugfixes (memory and resource management):
? ? - Fixed some memory leaks -- some quite frequent, some almost
? ? ? impossible to trigger -- based on results from Coverity.
? ? - Speed up parsing and cut down on memory fragmentation by using
? ? ? stack-style allocations for parsing directory objects. Previously,
? ? ? this accounted for over 40% of allocations from within Tor's code
? ? ? on a typical directory cache.
? ? - Use a Bloom filter rather than a digest-based set to track which
? ? ? descriptors we need to keep around when we're cleaning out old
? ? ? router descriptors. This speeds up the computation significantly,
? ? ? and may reduce fragmentation.
? o New/changed config options:
? ? - Now NodeFamily and MyFamily config options allow spaces in
? ? ? identity fingerprints, so it's easier to paste them in.
? ? ? Suggested by Lucky Green.
? ? - Allow ports 465 and 587 in the default exit policy again. We had
? ? ? rejected them in 0.1.0.15, because back in 2005 they were commonly
? ? ? misconfigured and ended up as spam targets. We hear they are better
? ? ? locked down these days.
? ? - Make TrackHostExit mappings expire a while after their last use, not
? ? ? after their creation. Patch from Robert Hogan.
? ? - Add an ExcludeExitNodes option so users can list a set of nodes
? ? ? that should be be excluded from the exit node position, but
? ? ? allowed elsewhere. Implements proposal 151.
? ? - New --hush command-line option similar to --quiet. While --quiet
? ? ? disables all logging to the console on startup, --hush limits the
? ? ? output to messages of warning and error severity.
? ? - New configure/torrc options (--enable-geoip-stats,
? ? ? DirRecordUsageByCountry) to record how many IPs we've served
? ? ? directory info to in each country code, how many status documents
? ? ? total we've sent to each country code, and what share of the total
? ? ? directory requests we should expect to see.
? ? - Make outbound DNS packets respect the OutboundBindAddress setting.
? ? ? Fixes the bug part of bug 798. Bugfix on 0.1.2.2-alpha.
? ? - Allow separate log levels to be configured for different logging
? ? ? domains. For example, this allows one to log all notices, warnings,
? ? ? or errors, plus all memory management messages of level debug or
? ? ? higher, with: Log [MM] debug-err [*] notice-err file /var/log/tor.
? ? - Update to the "June 3 2009" ip-to-country file.
? o Minor features (relays):
? ? - Raise the minimum rate limiting to be a relay from 20000 bytes
? ? ? to 20480 bytes (aka 20KB/s), to match our documentation. Also
? ? ? update directory authorities so they always assign the Fast flag
? ? ? to relays with 20KB/s of capacity. Now people running relays won't
? ? ? suddenly find themselves not seeing any use, if the network gets
? ? ? faster on average.
? ? - If we're a relay and we change our IP address, be more verbose
? ? ? about the reason that made us change. Should help track down
? ? ? further bugs for relays on dynamic IP addresses.
? ? - Exit servers can now answer resolve requests for ip6.arpa addresses.
? ? - Implement most of Proposal 152: allow specialized servers to permit
? ? ? single-hop circuits, and clients to use those servers to build
? ? ? single-hop circuits when using a specialized controller. Patch
? ? ? from Josh Albrecht. Resolves feature request 768.
? ? - When relays do their initial bandwidth measurement, don't limit
? ? ? to just our entry guards for the test circuits. Otherwise we tend
? ? ? to have multiple test circuits going through a single entry guard,
? ? ? which makes our bandwidth test less accurate. Fixes part of bug 654;
? ? ? patch contributed by Josh Albrecht.
? o Minor features (directory authorities):
? ? - Try not to open more than one descriptor-downloading connection
? ? ? to an authority at once. This should reduce load on directory
? ? ? authorities. Fixes bug 366.
? ? - Add cross-certification to newly generated certificates, so that
? ? ? a signing key is enough information to look up a certificate. Start
? ? ? serving certificates by ? ? ? pairs. Implements proposal 157.
? ? - When a directory authority downloads a descriptor that it then
? ? ? immediately rejects, do not retry downloading it right away. Should
? ? ? save some bandwidth on authorities. Fix for bug 888. Patch by
? ? ? Sebastian Hahn.
? ? - Directory authorities now serve a /tor/dbg-stability.txt URL to
? ? ? help debug WFU and MTBF calculations.
? ? - In directory authorities' approved-routers files, allow
? ? ? fingerprints with or without space.
? o Minor features (directory mirrors):
? ? - When a download gets us zero good descriptors, do not notify
? ? ? Tor that new directory information has arrived.
? ? - Servers support a new URL scheme for consensus downloads that
? ? ? allows the client to specify which authorities are trusted.
? ? ? The server then only sends the consensus if the client will trust
? ? ? it. Otherwise a 404 error is sent back. Clients use this
? ? ? new scheme when the server supports it (meaning it's running
? ? ? 0.2.1.1-alpha or later). Implements proposal 134.
? o Minor features (bridges):
? ? - If the bridge config line doesn't specify a port, assume 443.
? ? ? This makes bridge lines a bit smaller and easier for users to
? ? ? understand.
? ? - If we're using bridges and our network goes away, be more willing
? ? ? to forgive our bridges and try again when we get an application
? ? ? request.
? o Minor features (hidden services):
? ? - When the client launches an introduction circuit, retry with a
? ? ? new circuit after 30 seconds rather than 60 seconds.
? ? - Launch a second client-side introduction circuit in parallel
? ? ? after a delay of 15 seconds (based on work by Christian Wilms).
? ? - Hidden services start out building five intro circuits rather
? ? ? than three, and when the first three finish they publish a service
? ? ? descriptor using those. Now we publish our service descriptor much
? ? ? faster after restart.
? ? - Drop the requirement to have an open dir port for storing and
? ? ? serving v2 hidden service descriptors.
? o Minor features (build and packaging):
? ? - On Linux, use the prctl call to re-enable core dumps when the User
? ? ? option is set.
? ? - Try to make sure that the version of Libevent we're running with
? ? ? is binary-compatible with the one we built with. May address bug
? ? ? 897 and others.
? ? - Add a new --enable-local-appdata configuration switch to change
? ? ? the default location of the datadir on win32 from APPDATA to
? ? ? LOCAL_APPDATA. In the future, we should migrate to LOCAL_APPDATA
? ? ? entirely. Patch from coderman.
? ? - Build correctly against versions of OpenSSL 0.9.8 or later that
? ? ? are built without support for deprecated functions.
? ? - On platforms with a maximum syslog string length, truncate syslog
? ? ? messages to that length ourselves, rather than relying on the
? ? ? system to do it for us.
? ? - Automatically detect MacOSX versions earlier than 10.4.0, and
? ? ? disable kqueue from inside Tor when running with these versions.
? ? ? We previously did this from the startup script, but that was no
? ? ? help to people who didn't use the startup script. Resolves bug 863.
? ? - Build correctly when configured to build outside the main source
? ? ? path. Patch from Michael Gold.
? ? - Disable GCC's strict alias optimization by default, to avoid the
? ? ? likelihood of its introducing subtle bugs whenever our code violates
? ? ? the letter of C99's alias rules.
? ? - Change the contrib/tor.logrotate script so it makes the new
? ? ? logs as "_tor:_tor" rather than the default, which is generally
? ? ? "root:wheel". Fixes bug 676, reported by Serge Koksharov.
? ? - Change our header file guard macros to be less likely to conflict
? ? ? with system headers. Adam Langley noticed that we were conflicting
? ? ? with log.h on Android.
? ? - Add a couple of extra warnings to --enable-gcc-warnings for GCC 4.3,
? ? ? and stop using a warning that had become unfixably verbose under
? ? ? GCC 4.3.
? ? - Use a lockfile to make sure that two Tor processes are not
? ? ? simultaneously running with the same datadir.
? ? - Allow OpenSSL to use dynamic locks if it wants.
? ? - Add LIBS=-lrt to Makefile.am so the Tor RPMs use a static libevent.
? o Minor features (controllers):
? ? - When generating circuit events with verbose nicknames for
? ? ? controllers, try harder to look up nicknames for routers on a
? ? ? circuit. (Previously, we would look in the router descriptors we had
? ? ? for nicknames, but not in the consensus.) Partial fix for bug 941.
? ? - New controller event NEWCONSENSUS that lists the networkstatus
? ? ? lines for every recommended relay. Now controllers like Torflow
? ? ? can keep up-to-date on which relays they should be using.
? ? - New controller event "clients_seen" to report a geoip-based summary
? ? ? of which countries we've seen clients from recently. Now controllers
? ? ? like Vidalia can show bridge operators that they're actually making
? ? ? a difference.
? ? - Add a 'getinfo status/clients-seen' controller command, in case
? ? ? controllers want to hear clients_seen events but connect late.
? ? - New CONSENSUS_ARRIVED event to note when a new consensus has
? ? ? been fetched and validated.
? ? - Add an internal-use-only __ReloadTorrcOnSIGHUP option for
? ? ? controllers to prevent SIGHUP from reloading the configuration.
? ? ? Fixes bug 856.
? ? - Return circuit purposes in response to GETINFO circuit-status.
? ? ? Fixes bug 858.
? ? - Serve the latest v3 networkstatus consensus via the control
? ? ? port. Use "getinfo dir/status-vote/current/consensus" to fetch it.
? ? - Add a "GETINFO /status/bootstrap-phase" controller option, so the
? ? ? controller can query our current bootstrap state in case it attaches
? ? ? partway through and wants to catch up.
? ? - Provide circuit purposes along with circuit events to the controller.
? o Minor features (tools):
? ? - Do not have tor-resolve automatically refuse all .onion addresses;
? ? ? if AutomapHostsOnResolve is set in your torrc, this will work fine.
? ? - Add a -p option to tor-resolve for specifying the SOCKS port: some
? ? ? people find host:port too confusing.
? ? - Print the SOCKS5 error message string as well as the error code
? ? ? when a tor-resolve request fails. Patch from Jacob.
? o Minor bugfixes (memory and resource management):
? ? - Clients no longer cache certificates for authorities they do not
? ? ? recognize. Bugfix on 0.2.0.9-alpha.
? ? - Do not use C's stdio library for writing to log files. This will
? ? ? improve logging performance by a minute amount, and will stop
? ? ? leaking fds when our disk is full. Fixes bug 861.
? ? - Stop erroneous use of O_APPEND in cases where we did not in fact
? ? ? want to re-seek to the end of a file before every last write().
? ? - Fix a small alignment and memory-wasting bug on buffer chunks.
? ? ? Spotted by rovv.
? ? - Add a malloc_good_size implementation to OpenBSD_malloc_linux.c,
? ? ? to avoid unused RAM in buffer chunks and memory pools.
? ? - Reduce the default smartlist size from 32 to 16; it turns out that
? ? ? most smartlists hold around 8-12 elements tops.
? ? - Make dumpstats() log the fullness and size of openssl-internal
? ? ? buffers.
? ? - If the user has applied the experimental SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS
? ? ? patch to their OpenSSL, turn it on to save memory on servers. This
? ? ? patch will (with any luck) get included in a mainline distribution
? ? ? before too long.
? ? - Fix a memory leak when v3 directory authorities load their keys
? ? ? and cert from disk. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.
? ? - Stop using malloc_usable_size() to use more area than we had
? ? ? actually allocated: it was safe, but made valgrind really unhappy.
? ? - Make the assert_circuit_ok() function work correctly on circuits that
? ? ? have already been marked for close.
? ? - Fix uninitialized size field for memory area allocation: may improve
? ? ? memory performance during directory parsing.
? o Minor bugfixes (clients):
? ? - Stop reloading the router list from disk for no reason when we
? ? ? run out of reachable directory mirrors. Once upon a time reloading
? ? ? it would set the 'is_running' flag back to 1 for them. It hasn't
? ? ? done that for a long time.
? ? - When we had picked an exit node for a connection, but marked it as
? ? ? "optional", and it turned out we had no onion key for the exit,
? ? ? stop wanting that exit and try again. This situation may not
? ? ? be possible now, but will probably become feasible with proposal
? ? ? 158. Spotted by rovv. Fixes another case of bug 752.
? ? - Fix a bug in address parsing that was preventing bridges or hidden
? ? ? service targets from being at IPv6 addresses.
? ? - Do not remove routers as too old if we do not have any consensus
? ? ? document. Bugfix on 0.2.0.7-alpha.
? ? - When an exit relay resolves a stream address to a local IP address,
? ? ? do not just keep retrying that same exit relay over and
? ? ? over. Instead, just close the stream. Addresses bug 872. Bugfix
? ? ? on 0.2.0.32. Patch from rovv.
? ? - Made Tor a little less aggressive about deleting expired
? ? ? certificates. Partial fix for bug 854.
? ? - Treat duplicate certificate fetches as failures, so that we do
? ? ? not try to re-fetch an expired certificate over and over and over.
? ? - Do not say we're fetching a certificate when we'll in fact skip it
? ? ? because of a pending download.
? ? - If we have correct permissions on $datadir, we complain to stdout
? ? ? and fail to start. But dangerous permissions on
? ? ? $datadir/cached-status/ would cause us to open a log and complain
? ? ? there. Now complain to stdout and fail to start in both cases. Fixes
? ? ? bug 820, reported by seeess.
? o Minor bugfixes (bridges):
? ? - When we made bridge authorities stop serving bridge descriptors over
? ? ? unencrypted links, we also broke DirPort reachability testing for
? ? ? bridges. So bridges with a non-zero DirPort were printing spurious
? ? ? warns to their logs. Bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha. Fixes bug 709.
? ? - Don't allow a bridge to publish its router descriptor to a
? ? ? non-bridge directory authority. Fixes part of bug 932.
? ? - When we change to or from being a bridge, reset our counts of
? ? ? client usage by country. Fixes bug 932.
? o Minor bugfixes (relays):
? ? - Log correct error messages for DNS-related network errors on
? ? ? Windows.
? ? - Actually return -1 in the error case for read_bandwidth_usage().
? ? ? Harmless bug, since we currently don't care about the return value
? ? ? anywhere. Bugfix on 0.2.0.9-alpha.
? ? - Provide a more useful log message if bug 977 (related to buffer
? ? ? freelists) ever reappears, and do not crash right away.
? ? - We were already rejecting relay begin cells with destination port
? ? ? of 0. Now also reject extend cells with destination port or address
? ? ? of 0. Suggested by lark.
? ? - When we can't transmit a DNS request due to a network error, retry
? ? ? it after a while, and eventually transmit a failing response to
? ? ? the RESOLVED cell. Bugfix on 0.1.2.5-alpha.
? ? - Solve a bug that kept hardware crypto acceleration from getting
? ? ? enabled when accounting was turned on. Fixes bug 907. Bugfix on
? ? ? 0.0.9pre6.
? ? - When a canonical connection appears later in our internal list
? ? ? than a noncanonical one for a given OR ID, always use the
? ? ? canonical one. Bugfix on 0.2.0.12-alpha. Fixes bug 805.
? ? ? Spotted by rovv.
? ? - Avoid some nasty corner cases in the logic for marking connections
? ? ? as too old or obsolete or noncanonical for circuits. Partial
? ? ? bugfix on bug 891.
? ? - Fix another interesting corner-case of bug 891 spotted by rovv:
? ? ? Previously, if two hosts had different amounts of clock drift, and
? ? ? one of them created a new connection with just the wrong timing,
? ? ? the other might decide to deprecate the new connection erroneously.
? ? ? Bugfix on 0.1.1.13-alpha.
? ? - If one win32 nameserver fails to get added, continue adding the
? ? ? rest, and don't automatically fail.
? ? - Fix a bug where an unreachable relay would establish enough
? ? ? reachability testing circuits to do a bandwidth test -- if
? ? ? we already have a connection to the middle hop of the testing
? ? ? circuit, then it could establish the last hop by using the existing
? ? ? connection. Bugfix on 0.1.2.2-alpha, exposed when we made testing
? ? ? circuits no longer use entry guards in 0.2.1.3-alpha.
? o Minor bugfixes (directory authorities):
? ? - Limit uploaded directory documents to be 16M rather than 500K.
? ? ? The directory authorities were refusing v3 consensus votes from
? ? ? other authorities, since the votes are now 504K. Fixes bug 959;
? ? ? bugfix on 0.0.2pre17 (where we raised it from 50K to 500K ;).
? ? - Directory authorities should never send a 503 "busy" response to
? ? ? requests for votes or keys. Bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha; exposed by
? ? ? bug 959.
? ? - Fix code so authorities _actually_ send back X-Descriptor-Not-New
? ? ? headers. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
? o Minor bugfixes (hidden services):
? ? - When we can't find an intro key for a v2 hidden service descriptor,
? ? ? fall back to the v0 hidden service descriptor and log a bug message.
? ? ? Workaround for bug 1024.
? ? - In very rare situations new hidden service descriptors were
? ? ? published earlier than 30 seconds after the last change to the
? ? ? service. (We currently think that a hidden service descriptor
? ? ? that's been stable for 30 seconds is worth publishing.)
? ? - If a hidden service sends us an END cell, do not consider
? ? ? retrying the connection; just close it. Patch from rovv.
? ? - If we are not using BEGIN_DIR cells, don't attempt to contact hidden
? ? ? service directories if they have no advertised dir port. Bugfix
? ? ? on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
? o Minor bugfixes (tools):
? ? - In the torify(1) manpage, mention that tsocks will leak your
? ? ? DNS requests.
? o Minor bugfixes (controllers):
? ? - If the controller claimed responsibility for a stream, but that
? ? ? stream never finished making its connection, it would live
? ? ? forever in circuit_wait state. Now we close it after SocksTimeout
? ? ? seconds. Bugfix on 0.1.2.7-alpha; reported by Mike Perry.
? ? - Make DNS resolved controller events into "CLOSED", not
? ? ? "FAILED". Bugfix on 0.1.2.5-alpha. Fix by Robert Hogan. Resolves
? ? ? bug 807.
? ? - The control port would close the connection before flushing long
? ? ? replies, such as the network consensus, if a QUIT command was issued
? ? ? before the reply had completed. Now, the control port flushes all
? ? ? pending replies before closing the connection. Also fix a spurious
? ? ? warning when a QUIT command is issued after a malformed or rejected
? ? ? AUTHENTICATE command, but before the connection was closed. Patch
? ? ? by Marcus Griep. Fixes bugs 1015 and 1016.
? ? - Fix a bug that made stream bandwidth get misreported to the
? ? ? controller.
? o Deprecated and removed features:
? ? - The old "tor --version --version" command, which would print out
? ? ? the subversion "Id" of most of the source files, is now removed. It
? ? ? turned out to be less useful than we'd expected, and harder to
? ? ? maintain.
? ? - RedirectExits has been removed. It was deprecated since
? ? ? 0.2.0.3-alpha.
? ? - Finally remove deprecated "EXTENDED_FORMAT" controller feature. It
? ? ? has been called EXTENDED_EVENTS since 0.1.2.4-alpha.
? ? - Cell pools are now always enabled; --disable-cell-pools is ignored.
? ? - Directory mirrors no longer fetch the v1 directory or
? ? ? running-routers files. They are obsolete, and nobody asks for them
? ? ? anymore. This is the first step to making v1 authorities obsolete.
? ? - Take out the TestVia config option, since it was a workaround for
? ? ? a bug that was fixed in Tor 0.1.1.21.
? ? - Mark RendNodes, RendExcludeNodes, HiddenServiceNodes, and
? ? ? HiddenServiceExcludeNodes as obsolete: they never worked properly,
? ? ? and nobody seems to be using them. Fixes bug 754. Bugfix on
? ? ? 0.1.0.1-rc. Patch from Christian Wilms.
? ? - Remove all backward-compatibility code for relays running
? ? ? versions of Tor so old that they no longer work at all on the
? ? ? Tor network.
? o Code simplifications and refactoring:
? ? - Tool-assisted documentation cleanup. Nearly every function or
? ? ? static variable in Tor should have its own documentation now.
? ? - Rename the confusing or_is_obsolete field to the more appropriate
? ? ? is_bad_for_new_circs, and move it to or_connection_t where it
? ? ? belongs.
? ? - Move edge-only flags from connection_t to edge_connection_t: not
? ? ? only is this better coding, but on machines of plausible alignment,
? ? ? it should save 4-8 bytes per connection_t. "Every little bit helps."
? ? - Rename ServerDNSAllowBrokenResolvConf to ServerDNSAllowBrokenConfig
? ? ? for consistency; keep old option working for backward compatibility.
? ? - Simplify the code for finding connections to use for a circuit.
? ? - Revise the connection_new functions so that a more typesafe variant
? ? ? exists. This will work better with Coverity, and let us find any
? ? ? actual mistakes we're making here.
? ? - Refactor unit testing logic so that dmalloc can be used sensibly
? ? ? with unit tests to check for memory leaks.
? ? - Move all hidden-service related fields from connection and circuit
? ? ? structure to substructures: this way they won't eat so much memory.
? ? - Squeeze 2-5% out of client performance (according to oprofile) by
? ? ? improving the implementation of some policy-manipulation functions.
? ? - Change the implementation of ExcludeNodes and ExcludeExitNodes to
? ? ? be more efficient. Formerly it was quadratic in the number of
? ? ? servers; now it should be linear. Fixes bug 509.
? ? - Save 16-22 bytes per open circuit by moving the n_addr, n_port,
? ? ? and n_conn_id_digest fields into a separate structure that's
? ? ? only needed when the circuit has not yet attached to an n_conn.
? ? - Optimize out calls to time(NULL) that occur for every IO operation,
? ? ? or for every cell. On systems like Windows where time() is a
? ? ? slow syscall, this fix will be slightly helpful.

@_subject: Scott made me do it. 
I looked at Andrew's statistics. With Polipo, if one keeps re-loading the same page over and over, it takes a bit longer the first time, but then all subsequent loads are retrieved from cache, so there's no download time. Effectively (rounding the tiny number of milliseconds for retrieval from cache to zero), looking at the same page over and over becomes instantaneous after the first time when it's cached. However, I'm not clear on the value of this, unless the cache is encrypted.
What page would I wish to look at over and over but not download? And if I don't want the page on my hard drive, would I want it in the Polipo cache?
In a related topic, since Andrew questioned the value of Privoxy, I turned it off via Torbutton, and Yahoo mail now loads cleanly, if slowly, using only Tor. I don't notice a big improvement in overall speed, but this is only a subjective measure, I haven't really done any objective stats. And I'm not really concerned if turning Privoxy off saves me an unnoticeable amount of time. However, I'm also wondering, what dangers am I incurring bypassing Privoxy?

@_subject: Need help getting started 
I'll assume you downloaded the easy installation version for Windows, and that you may have downloaded a broken version. Some downloads provided Polipo but then tried to connect through Privoxy.
The latest Torbutton says it has been fixed to connect through Polipo, but when I first downloaded the latest stable version (Tor + Vidalia + Polipo + Torbutton), Torbutton kept trying to use Privoxy, and my computer did not have it (and/or Polipo wasn't initialised by default the way Privoxy was set to always run as a service, even when you weren't planning to use it).
Try re-downloading the easy install version and re-installing.
If that doesn't work, go into Torbutton and uncheck 'Use Privoxy' or 'Use Polipo' and just use Tor without either.
Hi, everyone!
I've just signed up to the list, and am still feeling my way (been a while since I've used a mailing list like this), so please excuse any bumps!
I've just downloaded and installed TOR to another of my computers that I use to try out new stuff on, but I can't seem to get it working properly. It all seemed to install OK, and when I start it, it seems to be connecting to the network OK too, but I'm unable to actually access any websites using it. So I'm asking for help here from those who know these things, as I'd really like to get TOR up and running ASAP.
My system spec is as follows:
Celeron 1.1GHz
128 Meg
20GB drive (about 2GB free)
XP Home SP3
Firefox 3.0.16 (I think - it updated last night...)
My ISP is Orange Broadband in the UK, and I'm running AVG Free 8.5, XPAntispy, Spybot-S&D and also have Malwarebytes Anti-Malware installed as a scanner.
When TOR is disabled, I can browse perfectly normally, but with it enabled, I just can't get to any websites at all - Not even the most basic HTML-only pages.
So I'm looking for advice on what's wrong, and what I need to do to fix it, and any help will be VERY gratefully received!

@_subject: Yahoo Mail and Tor 
What about those of us who consider Windows to be the Abomination of Desolation (1010011010) and refuse to run that operating system?
Privoxy provides pre-compiled Windows versions, but I was unable to download the source for Privoxy 3.0.12 via Tor and Privoxy, and it's blocked by my country's firewall, so I can't download without using Tor, either.
The standard Tor bundle download for non-Windows still includes Privoxy 3.0.6, which mangles Yahoo mail.
Any chance of either an update to a later version of Privoxy or an alternative privacy package in the standard Tor download for non-Windows OSs?
You should try the Tor Browser Bundle for Windows, and compare how
that goes. It uses Polipo rather than Privoxy, so should have different
application-level behavior.

@_subject: Yahoo Mail and Tor 
Two months??? I have had trouble with Yahoo Mail via Privoxy for more than four years.
At first, I was given some config file modifications for ?Privoxy so it would allow me to use Yahoo Mail, but this disabled a lot of the stuff Privoxy did, and I wanted that stuff for other sites. Also, I was still unable to log out of Yahoo Mail even with the modifications someone had posted. So I now disable all of Privoxy when signing out of Yahoo Mail.
Here, behind a Middle Eastern firewall, the Yahoo Mail signout is often blocked by the firewall, as well as by Privoxy for reasons that escape me. Sometimes, I can sign out if I don't use Tor at all. Other times, I can only sign out if I use Tor without Privoxy.
Yahoo mail is accessible through Privoxy, but all style sheets are disabled, so the display is rather annoying. Annoying or not, I use Privoxy until I need to sign out, disable Privoxy, sign out of Yahoo Mail, then turn Privoxy back on in default mode.
I'm still not sure what it is about Yahoo Signout that Privoxy (and the local firewall) see the need to block.
I use the gmail within Tor very easy but I have some problems sometimes
with other services of Google.
But about last two monthes there is problems with using the Yahoo mail
through Tor.

@_subject: Vidalia exit-country and Hulu 
Some time ago (2008) I read about a Canadian who used Tor to view Hulu.
I tried it from outside the US, and it worked, but the speed was too slow for me to use it regularly. Today, a clip from Hulu was highly recommended by the New York Times, so I tried again: Hulu now tries to block all attempts to connect via Tor. I tried two US exits, and both were blocked.
Of course, the idea of Tor is NOT to allow people to watch high bandwidth commercial videos restricted to US audiences, but to allow people who need privacy to obtain it.
Still, it was nice to be able to use tor to access Hulu while it lasted.

@_subject: Bridging from Bootcamp??? 
My ISP recently made unlimited access broadband  cheaper than dialup for
 anyone who is on-line more than 3 hours a day. So I signed up, and decided to enable sharing of my Tor.
I opened 'Sharing' and clicked on 'Help censored users.'
I am using a MacBook, Vidalia 0.2.10, and Tor 0.2.1.29, and am typically on-line for a few hours at a time during the day.
On the Snow Leopard side, sometimes 'Test port forwarding' gives an affirmative answer, and sometimes a 'No valid UPnP found', but even when
 the test fails, I soon see several people using my bridge.
On the Bootcamp side (Windows 7 Professional 64), 'Test port forwarding'
 always fails to find a valid UPnP, and no one ever manages to access my
 bridge.
(Of course, UPnP is turned on on my Aztec router.)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Make Wifi available through Tor? 
I prefer that no one be sure exactly where I am. Of course, to use Internet banking, they have to know WHO I am, which is OK as long as they don't know where.
But my bank, like the first post here that Andrew answered, does not permit access from countries other that the one I'm in, so, when I used Tor for Internet banking, they froze my Internet banking account.
So it depends on the bank.
Also, I used Internet banking over Tor for five years without a problem, until my bank got more 'security paranoid'.
So this might well be more and more of a problem.
The chance of an evil Tor node doing damage to my online banking is impossible, everything is encrypted, so all they'd see would be random bits. After all, my local ISP or any of the other intermediaries could do damage to online banking if it were not securely encrypted. But any attempt by a bad node to interfere could only block access, not retrieve any compromising data.

For one piece of data, I've been doing everything via tor for three
years now. I have yet to have a problem. This includes banking and
filing my taxes in the US.

Checktor said 'You are not using Tor' and gave my IP address as 202.189.69.150
Before, I used 'ExcludeExitNode' I looked up the fingerprint in the Tor files. Now that the files are microdescriptors rather than descriptors, I can't do this.
Is there a problem with ExitNode 202.189.69.150?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Wordpress blocking Tor? 
There is a Wordpress blog I like to read anonymously, but Wordpress seems to have started blocking access from the more popular Tor nodes sometime in the last week. I don't know if this is all of Wordpress, or just the blog I'm trying to access.
bach in Germany is blacklisted by Wordpress.
I hit 'new identity' and was able to connect via chaoscomputerclub3, also in Germany.
Sometimes, I have to hit 'new identity' several times before I can connect.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Unsafe for Tor? 
I use Tor for almost everything, and today my bank called to say my Internet banking had been disabled because I seemed to be logging in from different countries, and their new and improved policy to keep me safe is to only allow local access.
Since the bank puts everything over https, it would be hard for a bad relay to intercept any harmful information, but they figure 'you can't be too safe'.
So I won't be using Tor to access that bank ever again.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB Users: We Need New Directions on Torifying 
I concur. I'd like to be able to telephone anonymously, and I think others would like this ability. Sometimes, one must telephone to reach the appropriate person, and it's important that they cannot know for certain where one is at.
There are some semi-anonymous phone services I can use, but the software selects the port it will use to connect to the server, so the server knows exactly where I am, and probably who as well from my IP address and the ID I had to give my Internet provider.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor blocked 
In the part of the MENA where I am, the TBB no longer works, only the TBBobfs which is obsolete.
TBB was working at 6 am GMT, and not working at 1 pm GMT.
However, tor-obfsproxy-browser-bundle-2.3.12-4-en-US IS working.
Any chance it will be updated????
This place uses a standard US blocking service, so I suspect TBB will soon be blocked throughout the MENA and possibly beyond.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Unable to play YouTube Vids in Firefox with Tor 
I have had the same problem. It's not that the video is only available in Flash, because if it is, YouTube will say, 'You must download and install Flash' and give the link to Adobe.
My guess is that many videos are only available in some locations, and with Tor, you can't be sure where you appear to be, but it's somewhere the video is unavailable.
As someone pasted several years ago, if you can figure out where the video IS available, you can set that as your location by editing the torrc file.

@_subject: [tor-talk] An external application is needed... 
Once upon a time, if one clicked on a non-html link (pdf, doc, etc.) one got the warning that opening the document might unmask one. This warning is clearly valid for some documents, because they automatically connect to web-based resources to download linked files and images without going through Tor.
If, however, one right-clicked and selected 'download', no warning appeared, just the download dialogue box.
Now, however, even if one right-clicks and selects 'download' the warning usually appears. In earlier versions of TBB, the warning was sporadic, with the TBB sometimes giving the warning, and sometimes giving the download dialogue box, but now the warning seems to be consistent: try to download any file, and TBB issues the warning that the user is about to open a file that could unmask the user.
And I suppose there is some validity here: if one downloads a file with active links and then opens it, it may well automatically connect back and inform who, exactly, is viewing that file.
I don't think Word or Adobe Reader automatically connect external links without warning the user, but I could be wrong.
I would like to note that excessive security tends to convince the user that all security is excessive, until users just click 'Ignore' to every warning, so it is best if warning are limited to serious threats.
So my question is: do Adobe Reader and Word document automatically connect to download images and links without going through Tor, or do they just display links that the users must activate to download the content and thereby expose themselves? And if they give such warnings, why does TBB warn users against downloading them?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Can't access Tor network: Question about Find 
I am in a country where I am behind what I call the NSGFW.
Several months ago, I downloaded the TBB for Windows and found it could not establish a circuit (one must manually save all the cached data, and I had failed to do so). So I clicked Settings-->Network-->Find Bridges Now and quickly got a circuit.
More recently, I downloaded a newer TBB for Windows, again, it could not establish a circuit, so I clicked Settings-->Network-->Find Bridges Now and nothing happened.
I had to keep adding bridges manually, and at around bridge number 5, I finally got a connection. After which, I no longer needed a bridge.
Also, several months ago, I found that, if I managed to completed a circuit to use Tor myself for NSGFW evasion and privacy, I could make my laptop a transient bridge and select 'Publish my address'.
In a few minutes, I had people from Iran and China using my bridge, which, being transient, was hard to find and block.
Every time I got a new TBB I had to set the bridge back up, and I left it off for a few months.
When I tried to start the bridge up again recently, I left my laptop on for about 36 hours, but no one found me, so I turned it off to make it quicker to shut down, since it no longer seems to be findable.
Is this related to the fact the the 'Find Bridges Now' no longer finds any bridges? Is this a new and improved feature of the Tor network, or has my NSGFW figured out how to block 'Find Bridges Now' and also how to block people behind it from becoming bridges?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Can't access Tor network: Question about Find 
Not clear if I should put this in trac.torproject.org
My NSGFW does NOT block  so I can get bridges manually that way, but on my version of TBB for OSX: (Vidalia 0.2.17, Tor 0.2.2.35, Qt 4.7.4)
Find Bridges Now does NOT work.
Also, my transient bridge isn't posted on Find Bridges Now, and so can't be easily found, so I no longer run it (since it makes shutting down my laptop take longer, and I don't have anyone trying to use my bridge).
The 'find bridges now' button just hits directly. If your country blocks that site, the button will not work.

@_subject: [tor-talk] videos in TBB: Progress and Remaining aggravations 
A few months ago,? HTML5 was disabled by default, and Noscript blocked attempts to enable it.
Now, HTML5 is enabled by default (progress) but Noscript still tries to block all HTML5 videos, and must be manually disabled for those who want to see funny cats.
I'm not sure if there is any risk to HTML5, but, if not, perhaps Noscript options could be modified for the TBB to allow HTML5 videos by default?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Getting rid of commands in torrc 
Sometimes, I wish to access resources only available from IP addresses in a different country from the one where I'm located. So, if the resource is limited to IP addresses in Ptomania, I add
Exitnodes {po}
to my torrc using the Advanced Settings editor.
After I finish, I'd like to remove the Exitnodes {po} line from my torrc, but the Advanced Settings editor does not allow this.
Even though I unchecked the 'save settings' when I added the line
Exitnodes {po}
it remains after I stop and restart TBB both on a Macintosh and on Windows.
If I delete the line
Exitnodes {po} and check 'save settings' the line remains in my torrc.
I can find no way to get rid of the line.
Can someone explain how I can get rid of lines in my torrc using the Advanced Settings editor (or some other way)?

Not a bad idea, except the repressive governments with which I'm most familiar also ban Skype. (The ban on Skype isn't just for censorship, but to maximise revenue for the Telecom monopoly, which is either run by the government or by Friends of the government.)

10.6 still supports Rosetta to run old apps.

(and there was even more to be said for 10.4 which ran pre-OSX apps, but my 10.4 machine died).

A few weeks ago, I suddenly could not access comicskingdom.com with Tor.
For several years before that, I had no problem accessing comicskingdom.com with Tor.
It might be interesting to figure out how they are blocking Tor, since we want people to be able to use Tor to access sites that are otherwise blocked. (I haven't had any luck with this.)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Are webmail providers biased against Tor? 
Yahoo insists that users always log in from the same place. You need to identify yourself with a mobile (so they know where you are) or by going to some e-mail that is NOT Yahoo.
I set torrc to always use a single country EXITNODE, but if that country is the US, Tor frequently uses Germany instead, even with Strictnodes T
So when you tell torrc to only use exits in New York, Tor doesn't always listen and you'll get the 'unfamiliar device, please log in to your other e-mail or use your cellphone to log in' on Yahoo.
