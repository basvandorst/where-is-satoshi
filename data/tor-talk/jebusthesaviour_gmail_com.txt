@_subject: Good and bad ISP in Germany and around ? 
I used to have an exit node with server4you, when I asked them what
their views were they said it is illegal in Germany, other people seem
to be running exit nodes with them too, but their VPSs have a low tcp
socket allowance. I've since switched to vps4less, their VPS package is
cheaper and has a better allowance on resources, also unmetered traffic.

Minimum is 4Mbps, so ?36 per month. They do mention they can offer Tor
servers located in other jurisdictions, outside the UK. But a dedicated
server at your co-location of choice is a definite alternative.
