@_subject: BitTorrent - can it be blocked? 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the aim of an anonymous network such as
Tor to be able to deny any wrong-doing in a case such as this? After all,
why not prosecute all of the internet backbone router owners for allowing
the data to flow through their network?
PS. blocking BT isn't that easy as the standard ports are being used less
and less (particularly the data ones as some ISPs are apparently throttling
the 6881->6889 range)

Sure, I'll add some stuff.
Ultimately you might want to develop some kind of connection limit/speed
throttling (per client) at point of introduction?

@_subject: Using Tor with BitTorrent 
I believe that the only mechanism for inward connecting to a listener with
Tor is not via an out-proxy but via a "hidden service" - i.e. there is no
way to establish a proxy listener at an out-proxy (but I'm sure someone will
correct me if I'm wrong here:)
Use of a "hidden service" requires the inward connecting clients to
explicitly connect through Tor, as outlined in the Azureus document, so
there's no way to get such inward connections from non-Tor aware clients.
PS I also get a load of the error logs similar to the ones you report on
Windows with the latest RC and logging switched off (well, not enabled).

Hi Paul,
thanks for your quick answer, I couldn't answer so quick, had not much time
recently. I read some stuff about BitTorrent protocol and the Azureus
documentation now, and I guess a few things became clear now.
So you say, as I am only outward connected, nobody can connect to me, but I
can upload to clients I am connected with. So in my understanding I should
be completely anonym with these bi-directional down-/uploads, as long as I
restrict the program to only connect via Tor, right?
I re-installed Azureus now, and with help of the documentation I finally
made it work now. No outgoing connection anymore, all the traffic goes
through Tor and even the "...application is giving Tor only IP adress..."
failure is gone.
But I thought about the problem, that nobody can connect to me. What if I
would make a connection to a Tor outproxy and this outproxy would offer me a
listinig port to which clients can connect to me. Then all data could be
send over the already existing connection. Wouldn't that be a possible
solution. Or maybe there is some sort of an external service to which I
could connect via Tor and which then provides me that port. What do you
Besides: The "[warn] conn_read(): Unhandled error on read for OR
connection (fd368); removing" problem is gone since I de-installed some
programs, but I still have that problem saying: "[warn] circuit_log_path():
circ (length 3, exit randomtrash):solid(open) cannabis(open)
randomtrash(open)" if anybody could help

Hmm, I've set up a hidden service for the tracker and I'm getting core-dumps
with 0.0.8 when I run. I'm on Windows XP. Anything I can do to help diagnose
the problem? It dumps immediately if the service dir exists. It dumps after
a while if I delete the dir and run.

OK, with a bit of fiddling I've got Azureus to run both tracker and
peer-peer traffic through TOR, using a hidden service for the tracker and
then a hidden service for each peer for the data traffic.
If anyone's interested in how to do this, please ask.
Initial connection establishment is fairly slow but once the peers are
talking its not bad (can't really test myself as I have a slow uplink).

I have it working at the moment by proxying the tracker traffic (currently
defaulting to SOCKS V5 due to Java doing the proxying for us) and outbound
peer-to-peer traffic (via SOCKS 4a lashed up by myself). Of course, if
eveyone relies on outbound only then things don't work, so this approach
will only help if a small percentage of peers are taking it.
The idea of a hidden tracker sounds interesting, I'll investigate further.
Are there plans for a Java version of your software? SSL is "built in", as
are a lot of other security functions, so it may be fairly straight forward
to implement.
Do you think you could ever scale to carry BT traffic?
