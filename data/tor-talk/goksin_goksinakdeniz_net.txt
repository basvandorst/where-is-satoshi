Hello Vincent
You can run Tor via Tor Browser Bundle. Simply start TBB and then run
"Thunderbird+Torbirdy". Other option is install tor as a service and it will run at boot time
or later depending to configuration. Make sure that Tor service is
running before launching "Thunderbird+torbirdy"

It is already documented on TOR Project web site. [1] You can either
have tor installed from official Fedora repos or install it via TOR
project repos. To install it via TOr Project repos you need the arch of
your Fedora installation which is x86 or amd64/x8_64. Instructions are
available at web page, you can not miss it!.
Second step is torify you applications. [2] You can accomplish the 2nd
step by following instructions on adress [2]. In short you will need a
proxy fo applications which does not support socks proxy and for others
tor is available.
Before you start installing and configuring software aon web page [2]
some of the information may be outdated. It is a bit of trial and error
but it will be fine.
And one more thing: Some applications directly read you user account
information via environment settings from the shell you are running. In
order to tekll the apps who may require a proxy for for TOR you need to
adjust the http_proxy and https_proxy variables vir rc file of the
shell. [3]
