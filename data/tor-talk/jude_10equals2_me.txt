I didn't just do that.
Also if there is established protocol for mirroring  I'd be willing to do that.
I highly doubt one of my servers would be blocked.

What he said.  PHP is a huge risk.
I've worked with it before, even just trying to force SSL its a hassle.
At the very least consider running the webserver (AND all of the server-side scripts!) in a chrooted environment...
There is a very informative tutorial for lighttpd and fastcgi inside a chroot on (  It's for php4, but it ALMOST works out of the box for php5.  And they definitely give you the tools to troubleshoot that one thing that doesn't quite work.
If you need a little hand, or you are stuck, feel free to drop me a line.
Also, This forum seems to be pretty popular.
The smaller the better.  It's easier to audit a tiny package for leaks than it is a larger one.
I hope I said something interesting, and wasn't merely rambling.

Mount a partition noexec, and write your own front end using a combo of whatever scripting skillz you got, and a regular expressions library.
searching will be easy with find and locate, use the date command to timestamp things.
Every single message is now less than 10kb.
Seriously, we have dokuwiki, where is dokufora?

https everywhere is recommended, as tor only encrypts internal traffic.
Once you exit to the actual internet, any identifying information that you send could be used to identify you.
ie, if you log in to facebook, and if facebook still doesn't use ssl for their login, then you are potentially identifying yourself to anyone who wants to know.
It's really up to you.  I don't usually go for the observatory, but I do use the https everywhere.

From what I understand the observatory just aims to use statistics generated to identify 'fake' or malicious ssl certs.
I would definitely enable https everywhere, and strongly consider observatory, but both are optional...
Both are by EFF, and they are pretty trustworthy, but if you know what you are doing then you can disable both and still have strong anonymity.
If you don't know what you are doing you can enable both of them and still be perfectly exposed.

Weell, there's your problem.
Your using windows.
That right there is enough to kill any anonymity even if your using Tor.
Personally I have seen Windows machines become infected when:
It wasn't being used except once a week,
The user was one who had a reasonable knowledge of security (Me)
Anti-Virus (actually did not detect it..)
Incoming connections where heavily blocked (related,established)
You have plenty of RAM, run a virtual machine (virtualbox works great)
install debian on it (my personal choice) no gui.
give it 256MB of ram, no swap. (that's a LOT for this setup...swap off so that instead of freezing it just kills the process)
run Tor inside the VM.
Voila, ram usage will now NEVER exceed the size of the VM, and it's relatively easy to set up.
CPU usage for the VM will also be really low.

Sorry if this has been responded to, I've lost a few emails...
I don't believe the TBB has been high-jacked, but the TorButton Firefox extension certainly has.
(Forgive my faulty memory  "Anonymous" apparently convinced firefox (or someone at FireFox? No one was ever clear on this..) to upload a modified version.
They logged and tracked Tor users to find pedophiles.  Which they then logged and posted the IPs.
They even used a geoip database to map where the users were coming from.
So yeah.  They got IPs, they got information on pretty much all Websites If someone managed to do this to a reasonable number of people, you could get enough information to positively identify people.
Someone is bound to eventually visit one of their normal websites, and then you have access time, IP, and potentially the cookie.
"Anonymous is the modern equivalent of hysterical mob justice. I thought that was pretty obvious. Sometimes they throw rocks at assholes who deserve it, sometimes they throw rocks at people who got caught kicking a kitty and don't deserve to be stoned." -
     - Anonymous
^ That quote isn't about this particular case, but Anonymous in general.  Those logs could have easily fallen into the wrong hands and potentially gotten someone killed.  For what? two seconds of fame where they proudly tell the world "These IP address may have potentially accessed CP!!  Or not.  I mean it's not like anyone can actually DO anything with this information... Since we don't tell you positively what computer it's coming from... Hell could be hundreds of people using that IP... For the Lulz!!"

For Anyone who knows that this happened on their home linux system....
If you are on debian, install package secure-delete (close to that anyways.. Copy is here:
NOTE: This is dangerous, and only to be attempted by one who has a clue how to rescue a hosed system.
If you don't, then I have absolutely no pity on you.
If you have a separate home partition, make sure that you substitute also if you do home, you will not have to reboot or enter single-user. Instead of rebooting,
umount /home   the journal and sfill stuff... it's below...
mount /dev/{whatever partition} /home
Exit all programs, act like you're about to shutdown.
Now run these commands:
sudo init 1  # This should drop you down to a terminal, in single-user mode.
sudo sfill -v / &  all free space on the root partition with random data 35 times.
That'll take a few days on anything greater than 100Gb... Or you know, really long time on anything much bigger...
if you don't want to wait as long, you can wipe just the folder TBB was,
or you can make it less secure (still pretty much completely removed..) by running this:
sudo sfill -v -l -z / && sudo sfill -v -l /  once random, write once zero, write twice random. far less time...
If you are using a modern filesystem, that will NOT get rid of all of the data.
ext3/4, btrfs, reiserfs, jfs, xfs, all of these have journals.
You'll also need to get rid of the journal.
On ext3/4, run this BEFORE you start sfill:
sudo mount -no remount,ro /dev/{whatever your hd is}  the FS sudo tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/{whatever your hd is try typing 'sudo mount' if you don't know.}
sudo dumpe2fs /dev/{ditto} | more  this to make sure the journal is Then run one of the sfill commands, run a fs check, and create a new mount -n /dev/{ditto} /   the fs.  necessary for the sfill command to work.
 one of the sfill commands...
sudo mount -no remount,ro /dev/{ditto}  readonly again
sudo e2fsck -f /dev/{ditto}   a fs check
sudo tune2fs -j /dev/{ditto}  a net journal
Now your FS is in a slightly unstable state.
Now you can either reboot, or remount the fs.
It's probably cleaner just to reboot.
sudo shutdown -rF now  # This will reboot, and force a FS check when it comes back up.
Now, assuming that all went ok,
check to see if you can find the file in question:
   Use this tool/tools.
Q    Is this dangerous/could I lose data?
A    YES
Q    The first answer scares me...
A    Then don't do this.
Q    Will this guarantee it's really gone?
A    NO
Q    I messed up!!
A    did you read the whole thing and google anything you didn't know? if so read Q1.
Q    Have you actually tried this?
A    Nope, but I have seriously messed with my FS before.  This SHOULD work. but it might not.
Good luck, if everything went well, every deleted file on your system should be practically unrecoverable.

Hate to ask, but I don't know what country you live in...
If you live in the US, your service provider might have installed
Carrier IQ.  That would render Tor dangerous since they could potentially see that you are running Tor,
and see all of the activities/data that goes through Tor.
I'm pretty sure everyone knows about this, just wanted to throw that out
