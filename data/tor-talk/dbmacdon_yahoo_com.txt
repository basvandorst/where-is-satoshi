I've been using tor successfully in Saudi Arabia for over 2 years (OS  X). Suddenly I can no longer connect due to 'server errors':

Repeated efforts to connect to the same three servers continue  indefinitely without success. The problem first appeared immediately  after upgrading to v0.1.2.17, but also affects v0.1.2.16 that had  previously been working fine.
Could someone kindly help me resolve this problem?

Thanks for your help. Where do I find the Data Directory?

Thank you! I found the data directory at ~/.tor	 and followed your  instructions: Back on line!!
Will I have to repeat this process in the future?

Right. So far it's working. Interestingly 'TunnelDirConns' and  'PreferTunneledDirConns' are not described in the tor site manual  about torrc file options. However, they are listed by invoking --list- torrc-options from the terminal. Again, many thanks for your help.

Apparently privoxy (PPC) may not run after a Snow  Leopard install (see "privoxy must be stopped then tor connects"  . I would have thought that privoxy should run properly with the  optional Rosetta installation for Snow Leopard, but apparently the OS  x 10.6 "security agent prevents privoxy from starting" ( ). Is an OS X 10.6 bundle being prepared?

Well, I went ahead and installed Snow Leopard making sure to install  the optional Rosetta. Voila! Privoxy runs under Rosetta and the  current stable Tor-Vidalia-Privoxy bundle functions normally. I will  try the other all-x86  bundle when it is no longer an Alpha...
Thanks for your feedback
