@_subject: Discovering Than Several Accounts Belong To One Person 
I run two Tor clients. One client is configured normally, which I use for web browsing etc. The other has the option 'MaxCircuitDirtiness 0' which makes Tor set up a new route for every connection request. That way when I start Thunderbird and get my mail, my 3 accounts on the same website make 3 connection requests and get 3 separate routes with separate exit nodes. Now, an observer will still be able to see that an account is always accessed within a few seconds of 2 other accounts, but I think this is unlikely to be noticed.

I have not used Windows in a year or two. I can just start it twice from the command line using two different torrcs.

@_subject: Torsocks on FreeBSD 
I'm trying to set up Torsocks on FreeBSD. The configure script fails with the error "libdl is required".
 From googling it looks like libdl is a part of glibc, but glibc isn't listed in ports. The FreeBSD mailing list archives mention that libc does an equivalent thing, but I don't know how to tell configure to use it.
Sorry for the newbie question, but how do I get Torsocks to work with Theres a Tsocks port so it shouldn't be too difficult...

Sorry it took awhile to get back to you.
./configure works fine now, when I do make it gives me this list of errors:

That looks really cool. How well does it compile on *BSD? Any better than tsocks?
I'll try compiling it when I get a chance.

@_subject: Local transparent proxy with PF on OpenBSD 
Hello. I am trying to set up PF on my computer to redirect all my traffic into Tor. I followed the instructions on:
But every time I try to connect Tor to the internet through my local network, it fails. I have been tinkering with my internet settings for hours, I think the DHCP might be interfering with the settings, but I am not an expert enough to troubleshoot this problem very well.
I have made the settings exactly as suggested on the wiki page.
I searched google, the wiki, the mailing list archives and asked on the Tor IRC, but I don't know what is wrong (Its probably just some stupid Does anyone have experience with transparent proxies and PF?

@_subject: another reason to keep ExcludeNodes 
Isn't ExcludeNodes widely enough used that if it was discontinued then people would use obsolete versions or try to hack Tor to get it back?
The reason I use Tor is that it takes power from those collecting huge databases and puts it back in my hands. I would be a bit annoyed if I was unable to control my own Tor client to it's fullest.

Interesting. You used pretty much the reverse of what I was doing.
My process is something like:
Set up a jail with sshd
Install xauth, firefox, thunderbird, etc. in the jail
Set up ssh outside the jail to be able to connect to the jail
    and have X connections forwarded
Set up PF to forward all connections to Tor's TransPort,
    which is on the host system
Use ssh to start a program, eg firefox, and it appears
    on the host system's desktop
What I am having trouble with is step 4. It *looks* like PF
is working fine, but Tor doesn't see the traffic to the TransPort.
I think I have just been designing the firewall rules stupidly.
The Tor Wiki gives a different scenario so it isn't too helpful.

Oh... So rdr rules dont apply to lo0. No wonder the Wiki instructions are so complicated.
I am not very experienced at PF... if anyone could help me understand this workaround
better it would be very appreciated!
route-to sends it to the lo1 interface
on the lo1 interface the IP it is heading to is changed to 127.0.0.1 port 9040
some other rules to make sure nothing else gets out
Is that it? It still seems very confusing.

I finally cracked it! This PF ruleset let me send a test request from firefox within a jail to
Tor's TransPort (9040), the IP 127.0.0.2 is the jail and an alius of lo0:
rdr pass on lo1 inet proto udp from any to port 53 -> 127.0.0.1 port 53
rdr pass on lo1 inet proto tcp from any to port 53 -> 127.0.0.1 port 53
rdr pass on lo1 inet proto tcp from any to port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 9040
pass out route-to lo1 inet proto tcp from 127.0.0.2 to port 80 flags S/SA modulate state
pass out route-to lo1 inet proto udp from 127.0.0.2 to port 53 keep state
Of course it needs to be expanded and modified for my purpose, but this
simple ruleset can be used as a better example for that than the complex but
complete one on the Wiki I think.

Does anyone here jail, sandbox or chroot the applications they use with Tor?
I have been trying to adapt the Wiki's transparent proxy recommendations
to a FreeBSD jail for the last couple weeks with no luck. What is the best way
to isolate applications completely for use with Tor?

I just got this redirection too! Unfortunately I was running log notice and no Vidalia so I couldn't see what exit I was using. I'll work on setting it up so I can tell what exit I was using.
