@_subject: [tor-talk] Portuguese transation for free 
Hi, I just want to let you guys know that I can help with the translations from English to Spanish and Portuguese for free. I'm trying to improve my English and I think that is a good oportunity for me, and a nice help for you to make your programs/interfaces available to other languages.
I can't code, but i think translation is a nice way to help too.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Advices for a Newbie 
Hi everyone. My name is Pedro, I'm 21 and i live in Brazil. I've been on TOR for a while and now i'm interested in studying the network. Do you guys know some articles to learn more about Internet security, privacy and technical details about the subject. I'm a newbie on the topic, so it would be nice to start from the basics of networks and such. What do you guys recommend ?
