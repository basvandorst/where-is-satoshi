I've got a noob-ish question... and after having not
enough coffee I may just be missing it...
On Win32, I am running tor/vidalia/privoxy.  Question 1: are my dns requests being leaked (or
better yet, how I can tell for myself - ethereal?)?  - If so, is dns-proxy-tor a solution to this?
 - If not, what beenfit would dns-proxy-tor give me?
Question 2: Is freecap a solution to dns leakage? Or
is this targeted for another situation?
Sorry for being so naive, but I haven't found that
much documentation on dns-proxy-tor...

I have to thank everyone for their replies -- I am
accessing via webmail now and will send out proper
replies when I get back to the office.  In the
I thought that Socks5 was god enough to stop leaks --
but apparently not. It seems from reading all the
responses, that this was a bit unclear... but to
re-hash, Frecap is not the app to use to stop DNS

@_subject: Tor / Privoxy for local URLs 
I have a machine called twiki - it's running on a machine on my LAN:
When I have Tor and Privoxy enabled, and I try to browse it via FireFox
I get:
        No such domain
    Your request for * could not be fulfilled, because the
    domain name *twiki* could not be resolved.
I am sure that there's a config file I have to edit - can anyone point
in the right direction?

Hi Fabian and M -
Thank you very much for your prompt and helpful answers.  I noted both
of them and used Fabian's with success.  This totally works and I
appreciate it.

Is this the most appropriate list to ask a question about installing Tor
on Debian?  I have a weird error after installing and wasn't sure if I
should post it here or on a Debian list.

@_subject: DNS Server question 
Hello -
I am a total newbie to Tor/Privoxy/Vidalia - but am hooked.  Running
Windows/FireFox, setup was a snap... I even had a few friends install it
w/o issue.
My question is this: I have a small LAN here - with a Windows 2K3
server, and I use my WinXP box most of the day.  I have installed Tor,
etc on the XP box and for my DNS servers I have:
Where the 10.x number is my DNS server (also the Win2K3 box).
My question is, after reading the Tor website should i be worried about
this config?
Should I be installing Tor on the 2K3 sever?
Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question.  If it does, then I am not
explaining it well enough :)

@_subject: DNS Server question 
OK - so that being said, which DNS address should I use then in the
Windows Networking dialog?  I am looking through the website now but
can't see it.
OK - I am actually getting ready to install a tor server :)  and then
you answered my 2nd question as well.  It's much appreciated...

@_subject: DNS Server question 
I wanted to ask for a small bit of clarification:
If I have the setup as:
DNS servers:
Where the 10.x number is my DNS server (also the Win2K3 box). Will my DNS queries be seen by my ISP even though I have Privoxy running?  I _thought_ that was what Privoxy was for... but I could be wrong.

@_subject: DNS Server question 
OK - so if I understand correctly...
If I setup FireFox to use:
Manual Proxy Configuration:
HTTP Proxy: localhost:8118
SSL Proxy: localhost:8118
SOCKS Host: localhost:9050
SOCKS v5
then, this should be routing the DNS queries from FireFox over tor thus
hiding the DNS queries from the ISP from within FireFox... right? or no? :)

@_subject: TorDNS (was DNS Server question) 
imply that the WinXP version will run on 2003.  Have you tested it on
your machine?  If not, I have a VM I can try it out on next week and
report back here.
That being said:
 - Can anyone vouch for the integrity of the app from the above URL?  I
didn't see any hash value or key with it.
 - Is there a script or resource that would allow the user to quickly
toggle from the "normal" setup (i.e. non-TorDNS) and TorDNS?  I suppose
I can write one with WSH but was curious if anyone has done this
already.  If I do write one, and it's indeed possible I will post it here.
 - How many people on this list are using TorDNS on Windows? Do you like
it, (re: issues of speed, etc.)?

@_subject: Configure TorDNS 
OK -
I have downloaded and copied the following files to c:\program files\tor:
 - tordns.exe
 - startup.exe
I ran startup.exe and tordns.exe (which gives me the sys tray icon that
shows 12.7.1.2.2).
I configured the Windows Firewall to allow TorDNS to be an exception.
Changed the TCP/IP Settings to use 127.1.2.2 as the only DNS Server
(leaving the 2nd one blank).
I edited the hosts. file in \windows\system32\drivers\etc\ to add a line:
 - 127.1.2.2 socklocal
I stopped the DNSCache service
I restarted Tor
Everything works except that DNS entries are not being resolved - in
other words I cannot surf the net.
The directions at  are very
unclear and I am sure I missed something.  Can anyone let me know what
it is?

@_subject: DNS Server question 
OK - SO I can use TorDNS to route the DNS queries through Tor - is there
anyway to make Windows use the Tor to connect to the internet for
everything?  In other words I have a program that does not allow me to
configure it's connection through a proxy.  I'd like everything on the
PC to connect to the net via Tor.

@_subject: Configure TorDNS 
First I want to apologize for the barrage of questions - I normally read
as much as I can before posting, and in this case I have, but Googling
TorDNS does not bring much in the way of results...  That being said I
want to ask questions in an intelligent way even though some of them may
seem elementary (probably are to most of you).
So I downloaded the TorDNS localhost version.  That magically worked :) I'd still like to find out which files I need to edit to get the other
version working.  In the meantime - here's one more:
I have ZoneAlarm installed.  I have noticed that TorDNS gets ZoneAlarm
to popup to tell me TorDNS is trying to access the net with the
following IP addresses:
127.0.0.1:9050 (the Tor app)
I wonder why it tries to connect to two separate ports for Tor.
Also, since I have disabled the DNS Client service and have changed the
DNS Server to 127.1.2.2 I can no longer ping machines on my LAN.  Is
there a workaround for this?

@_subject: Configure TorDNS 
Thanks for the email Roger...  I've uninstalled TorDNS and started
testing dns-proxy-tor.  However it seems that I can only browse the
internet if Tor is enabled.  If I disable Tor and have my DNS Server set
to 127.0.0.1 as it says in the readme, it cannot resolve the domain
names.  Is there a workaround for this?
Also, if I have dns-proxy-tor installed should I turn off the DNS Client
Service?  What are the pros/cons to leaving it on?

@_subject: Configuring DNSPort 9999 
In the readme for tor 0.2.0.2, it said:
Major features, client usability:
    - A client-side DNS proxy feature to replace the need for
      dns-proxy-tor: Just set "DNSPort 9999", and Tor will now listen
      for DNS requests on port 9999, use the Tor network to resolve them
      anonymously, and send the reply back like a regular DNS server.
      The code still only implements a subset of DNS.
I added this line to my torrc file, but cannot seem to get this working.  I am running WinXP.  Do I need to change the DNS Servers on my n/w connection?  If so, to what?
Any pointers are greatly appreciated.

Without the use of GnuPG, or something along those lines, how would we
know that the "I'm OK message" was really from Joe...?
