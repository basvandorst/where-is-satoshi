@_subject: [GSoC] Overall Network Status ... 
Hi all!
I want to take care of the "Overall Network Status" project for the
Google Summer of Code 2008. By automated collecting & merging the
available information related to the network health I would like to
calculate statistical values of importance, like arithmetic mean of
uptime, bandwith, number of exit nodes, and many more ...
The full proposal can be found here:
I'm open for feedback & comments on my proposal.
Kind regards, Martin Mulazzani

Sure, that would be great!
That would also give me more time to find interesting metrics, better
visualisation, and more ... and I wouldn't have to reinvent the wheel :)
I will check out the SVN asap.
Kind regards, Martin Mulazzani

In the past few days there was a drop in the number of servers with the
guard flag set. See the attatched picture. Number of running, running
exit and running fast servers is as usual.
If you are interested I can check what countries changed the number of
guard servers compared to regular activity.
Kind regards, Martin Mulazzani

I tried something similar recently. My approach was to monitor the
infrastructure only, as this is public knowledge, and collect no
informations on the clients whatsoever. I incorporated this monitoring
already into TorStatus. Check out the SVN of TorStatus for the
implementation and see the trunk version of TorStatus @
 or
It is not yet perfect. The timeslot for updating is too short, so the
graphs look frayed. Short summary:
    * collect the total number of running, running exits, running guards
      and running fast servers and save them in an RRD over time.
    * On the top 11 countries these values are collected as well.
Kind regards, Martin

Both are neat features, we should include them in the next release of TNS.
