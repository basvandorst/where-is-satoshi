Lately there's been (on average) around 25-30 servers in the 149.9.xxx.xxx 154.35.xxx.xxx (PSINET - Washington, DC) range, all high bandwidth.
netstat and showmyip.com reveal that an IP in that range are (~90% of the time)
both entry and exit nodes for a least the last month.
That CAN'T be a good thing.
