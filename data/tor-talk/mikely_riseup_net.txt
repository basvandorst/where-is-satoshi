For my particular case setting up separate SocksPort for each
connection would be an overkill. Let me explain shortly:
Suppose I want to update N different RSS feeds which are hosted on IP
addresses owned by one or few big tech companies - a network activity
with a very recognizable pattern. Such pattern then can be correlated
to other identifiable information which makes tracking (or creating a
shadow profile of) a person easier.
So to minimize the possibility of such patterning I am willing to:
(1) refresh each feed from a different IP address
(2) at (more or less) different times
(3) perhaps using a different *popular* user agent string (but I still
don't know which ones are the most used ones for RSS readers).
On this mailing list I am hoping to find an efficient solution to (1).
Currently I do it like:
oldip=$(torsocks dig  ANY myip.opendns.com +short)
while [ "${newip}" == "${oldip}" ]
    # Request new identity as described in     newip=$(torsocks dig  ANY myip.opendns.com +short)
I am willing to avoid the call to an external service for checking the
current and new IP address. On tor-relay list I was told that the best
way is to build circuits manually. Unfortunately I don't know how to do
it, so I am asking here.
I hope that clarifies.

How do you do all this please?
I am not a Tor expert. For the moment I just know how to request new
identity (from the the FAQ). I don't know what is "consensus" or
"MAPADDRESS" or "exitlist parsers". I guess I am searching the wrong
way too as I don't find much clear info on this.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB "Security Level" Question. 
[Disclaimer: a non expert view on the subject]
JavaScript is a way for sites to fingerprint you much more accurately.
Once fingerprinted, it doesn't really matter from what IP address you
are connecting. Your activity on the web can be correlated even if you
browse from different IP addresses each time.
So there is a good reason to keep JS, WASM and anything that downloads
and executes remote code on your computer off by default. That is
indeed the highest security level for a reason. Of course having JS off
is itself a dimension which can be used as part of a fingerprint but it
is far less significant than the multiple dimensions a JS=on setting
would give you.
*Not to forget that JS in combination with non-mitigated CPU
vulnerabilities can be a much bigger security whole (e.g. a script
reading the contents of your RAM as demonstrated by Google Project

============================== START ==============================
I am looking for a way to request a new Tor exit IP address *different*
- the one(s) currently in use by other active connections
- [if possible also] the one(s) used recently
Requesting a new identity is insufficient because it doesn't always
give a different exit IP address. To clarify: my aim is *not* to build
any malicious bot or anything like that.
I have been told that the proper way to do this is to "write a stem
script that builds circuits manually" and that this current list is the
right place to ask for help.
Although I have some small (non-professional) experience in writing
fairly simple scripts (PHP, JS, bash) I am not an expert (still a
beginner in Python) and this task is beyond my current capabilities.
I hope someone can help.
