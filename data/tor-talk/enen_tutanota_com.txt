@_subject: [tor-talk] always get the same entry node 
I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and Tor Browser Bundle 4.5.? With the new Tor Button feature I have discovered I always get the same entry node, is this normal?
I have tried the following
- New Identity via Tor Button
- quit and restart TBB
- quit wait some hours and restart TBB
This has persisted for about a day now (upgrade to 4.5), though it's possible it has happened with older versions it was just not as readily noticeable
The entry in question is: 192.150. 94.49
