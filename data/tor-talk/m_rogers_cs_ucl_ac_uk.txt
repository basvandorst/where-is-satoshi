@_subject: getting more exit nodes 
Are you sure it's a good idea to encourage non-technical users, who might not understand the legal risks, to run exit nodes?

@_subject: A way to allow firewalled exit nodes [Was: Re: getting more exit  
Maybe Tor could copy Gnutella's connection reversal trick: if a node X is firewalled, it connects to any unfirewalled node Y and publishes Y's address in its descriptor. When an unfirewalled node Z wants to open a connection to X, it sends a message to X through Y, and X opens a connection back to Z. The X->Z connection is used exactly as if it were a Z->X connection established in the normal way. The circuit doesn't pass through Y, so all the crypto from TLS upwards remains the same.
Your comments about modifying the descriptors would still apply, though, and clients would have to be aware of it because connection reversal can't establish a connection between two firewalled nodes, so no circuit could contain two consecutive firewalled nodes (I guess that might have implications for anonymity as well). But if it allows more people to run nodes then maybe it's a worthwhile tradeoff?

George Danezis has looked at using sparse expander graphs for mix networks [1]: each node has a small number of neighbours but can reach any other node in a small number of hops, so if the circuit is long enough the entry node can't narrow down the list of possible exit nodes or vice versa. Unlike Tor, the small number of neighbours per node makes it possible to provide cover traffic.
It's not clear whether social networks are good expanders [2][3], but Shishir Nagaraja has looked at using social networks for mix networks [4]; the LiveJournal social network appears to be suitable, although you have to use more cover traffic than you would in an ideal expander graph.

Do you have a legal argument to back this up? I'm sure AT&T's lawyers
would like to hear it.
