It must have been a glitch. I did restart tor and forced to reset its data though and still couldn't get through. Tried about 10 minutes later with the same result.

I am sick of them all!
Initially, there was a small number of these in the wild, but now it is widely spread - google is the main offender, but youtube (which is, as we all know, google-owned) and now, wait for it, scroogle.org (a site I use a lot) is also at it!
Tor-blocking could be very easily to implement by parsing cached-descriptors{.new} to see all exit nodes and then add them to a blacklist and start blocking. Is there anything which can be done to prevent this?
I am thinking of something similar to what is currently in existence with the bridge system - you don't know them all, just a portion of it, enough to connect you to the network. Could something similar be implemented with tor?

Nope. I am well aware of this and it isn't an issue which just popped yesterday or a week ago - it has been going on for months (scraping Google, that is). I am also aware that Scroogle has a limited (I think about 6-7) number of servers.
What I meant with my initial post though is that Scroogle started blocking tor exit nodes recently - about a week or so ago. I know that, because I tried to access it at the same time (via different machines) and all requests which used Tor exit nodes were timing out (or giving me 502) - without exception, while the "normal" requests (using my own IP address) made at the same time passed through to Scroogle instantaneously! This cannot be a coincidence.
If you do not believe me - see it for yourself - initiate at least a couple of simultaneous requests (so that you can engage as much of Scroogle's servers as possible at one time) using Tor exit nodes and do the same using your own IP address and see what happens.
I will try and prepare such a list of sites I have encountered blocking Tor and post it here.

The most sensible answer in this thread - by far!
Ixquick isn't good either - when I tried it, I get this little gem: "You may be using a privacy-oriented browser extension that conflicts with Ixquick. Please disable this extension and try your search again. If this does not help, please contact us at (212) 447-1100 (USA) or autoquery @ ixquick.com." Yeah, right, as if I am going to do that!

Neither are any good - from what I gather, yacy requires software installed on my machine (yeah, right, why would I want to pollute my machine with some unknown software for the "privilege" of using a bloody search engine?) and seeks isn't any good either, not secure at all! On top of it all, the query strings form part of the URL ( - for example, check out the "q" parameter), so they are visible to anyone who wishes to track me down.
Scroogle, is/was the best out there - by a mile! Nothing even comes close, unfortunately!

That is not the issue - the fact that startpage is snooping to see whether I use "privacy-oriented browser extension" should be good-enough reason for any sane individual out there to ditch this abomination! Same goes for ixquick as well.

It does to me! A search engine is interested in my browser privacy settings and whether I use "privacy-oriented browser extensions". It goes on to "advice" me to turn OFF my "privacy-oriented browser extensions" in order to use that same search engine - that message looks pretty clear and straight-forward to me and that is why I won't use this site at all, as I value my privacy. As I already posted, any sane individual out there would do the same.
Which means what to me exactly?!
I have no interest whatsoever in starting to dig out "what the problem is" as to me it is a clear-cut case of yet-another-no-mark-site vying for a customer base to profit from. Thanks, but no thanks!
Well, the fact that you have used ixquick instead of scroogle "for years", given that until a week or so ago scroogle was available speak Do they use javascript?
And you know this how, exactly?!

@_author: Mr Dash Four 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Scroogle is No More? 
To put it simply - I am not at all interested in any of that.
If a search-engine site is there to present search results, the last thing on their mind would be what privacy settings I have on my browser or what "privacy-oriented extensions" I use, let alone "advising" me to switch them OFF in order to use the service they provide - I thought you have figured this out by now.

@_author: Mr Dash Four

Ask yourself this - why is a search engine site so much interested in my own privacy settings? And why is it that I've never had any such "privacy-oriented" issues with scroogle, ever! if you are able to address/answer those two, then you are in the right path.

Really?! And who the hell do you think you are, exactly?! Please enlighten me, and explain why should I provide you with *any* additional "evidence" at all?
Until I have read your "recommendation" post earlier on today, I had absolutely no idea who or what startpage or ixquick actually is. There is nothing whatsoever compelling me to provide you, or anybody else, with any sort of additional "evidence" or giving out details of what I have deployed on my browser (or outside of it).
Let me repeat that again so that it is clear once and for all - I have no obligation *whatsoever* to provide you or anybody else with any details at all of either what I use on my system or what kind of setup I If you are unhappy with that ... well tough shit!
To be frank, I don't give a flying fuck what your "habits" are! You and your "low-key" friend, on the other hand, seem to be very keen to promote those two abominations of a search-engine, so the hypocrisy on show in the above paragraph of yours is just mind-blowing!

Eh?! Why do you think I care what you, or anybody, thinks? You and your "low-key" friend are an irrelevance - I know what I saw when I accessed those two sites earlier today and nothing will compel me to access them ever again, or use them as my search engine tool of choice, no matter how hard you may try to convince me otherwise!
There is a small flaw in the above, however - the Tor Project is a well-known entity with a rich history of protecting personal privacy and security (a project I have made contributions to myself, I might add). The absolute no-mark search-engine sites you are trying to push really hard in this thread, however, are not - not even close! Only an imbecile with no more than two brain cells would compare them two.

I don't really care whether you think I am trustworthy or not - I am certainly not going to lose any sleep over it, quite frankly.
I posted yesterday what I needed to post and put my reasons why I am not going to use the mickey-mouse search engines you and your friend recommended and there is currently nothing whatsoever to make me change my mind. As to why someone/anyone should take me seriously - that is up to them, frankly. As I already pointed out above - either way, I am not going to lose any sleep over it.
You are assuming that I am using tor button, which I don't.
I don't see any reason why should I give you an explanation as to the reasons I joined this list, let alone explaining the reasons behind what I post or why I post it.

Nope, none of the above. As for whether I have to give you, or anybody else, a comprehensive list of the browser add-ons I am using or the system configuration I deploy outside my browser - read my previous post on the subject.
To conclude this, I posted what I had to post yesterday and put my reasons why I am not going to use the "search-engine" sites two of the other contributors recommended - for me "sniffing" what "privacy-oriented browser extensions" I use or deploy, let alone asking be to switch them OFF in order to access/use the said site is a good-enough reason to stay well-clear.

If by "disjoint" you mean irrelevant, I disagree - having tor does not guarantee you privacy - this hard fact is communicated to everyone who bothers reading the first line of output to the console when tor starts - tor does NOT guarantee you anonymity, particularly if you can't help it yourself.

Indeed (assuming it was "duckduckgo.com" - without the "f")!
For Firefox users out there - and then pick up your choice of: 1) NO JS; 2) with SSL; and 3) NO filter/Ads (I thought the "lite" version was the best as it offered all 3 and there is no unnecessary clutter on the screen too) - plenty of choices there, which work - at least on first glance there is nothing suspicious anyway.
I have modified one of the search engine scripts on offer there to suit my own (personal) needs and also made it to work on my smartphone.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Email provider for privacy-minded folk 
Indeed! I also employ one additional measure, which, admittedly, may not be to everyone's taste - I have all my browser/system/email/everything-else-you-care-to-name root certificate store wiped out clean!
If I have to access a specific (https) site or access a new email account (by using secure pop/starttls, secure smtp or secure imap) I tend to get the site's certificate well in advance via other means (not through tor, obviously) and store it manually on my system for use by these programs. That way, I know that if the "certificate unrecognised" error pops up there is either 1) a new site I have never accessed before (most likely); or 2) someone is trying to use spoof certificates.
The latter doesn't occur very often, though I've had this on a number of (rare) occasions when a tor exit node for example (prior to being banned in my torrc file and banished forever) tries to pretend to be my email server and gets caught out with its pants down, quite literally... This measure also prevents the likes of hacked/rogue CA's out there leaking certificates to people/organisations who use them for various criminal/unsavoury purposes.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Phones for Tor 
Interesting option this, pity the documentation is virtually non-existent (how to build/use etc).
This phone appears to be Windows-based. I see that they are banging on about their FOSS on every web page on their site, but that doesn't change the fact that the whole software is based on the Windows-platform. I don't know about you, but I don't trust Micro$oft as far as I could throw them.
Also, it looks as though the whole Cryptophone's setup is centralised (you have to register centrally - to their servers?), so this is another no-no from me - I like everything *de*-centralised (a la Tor) and I also like to have full control of everything what goes on on that phone - fancy menus which don't tell me much is something frowned upon here.
Interesting feature is the Baseband firewall - I'd love to have some of that - anyone know of (decent) Android/Linux-based implementations of this?

@_date: 2013-07-25 11:53:28
@_author: Dash Four 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Phones for Tor 
You trust M$/Windows if you want to, but I'd steer clear of them whenever I can.
Yeah, but it is still a Windows source (besides, there is no mention whether they distribute the whole source of their product, including the Windows components/API, or just their source code alone) and I certainly don't have the resources/manpower to audit that stuff, which is why I prefer Linux-based systems - it has always been open source, it has been around for more than 15 years and it has a large number of community members who have contributed to it and made it for what it is today.
Care to point me out to a link? There isn't anything on their web site that I could see, offering Android-based unit.
The term "firewall" is a bit misleading, since this feature is supposed to prevent over-the-air attacks by your network operator/malware "specialists" (see  for a brief introduction to this). More advanced versions could also filter the modem commands sent by the network operator/others. The sad thing is that I have not seen full FOSS implementation of this yet.
Indeed. To me, Android is the lesser of the two evils - ideally, I would have liked to have "standard" Linux on my phone (as far as I know, Ubuntu are the only ones which could offer this, discarding Jolla for the time being as they have not made anything official yet), but this is a pipe dream, so Android is the next "acceptable" option - at least for now.
The other two options, as far as I can see, are either having Windows or closed-source/propriety system, both of which are a no-no for me.
Apart from the "locked-in" system (which, again, appears to be Windows-based) and the baseband firewall, I don't see anything they could offer, which isn't already present.
Secure communications could be accomplished with existing tools/protocols (zrtp/ssl for media, tls for signalling) and there is a plethora of Android-based apps already offering that - OSTel/CSipSimple to mention just two such apps, so I don't really see any benefit of Cryptophone at all.
Can't you accomplish this with existing "standard" Linux tools? I could think of a number of packages in Linux, which deal with disk encryption and are quite good for example.

Indeed. very useful too - it allows you to configure your search engine the way you want it:
- to have/not have JS;
- to have/not have your search terms submitted by POST (important, since the latter prevents your url being "skimmed");
- to have/not have all of your search terms/results go over ssl;
- to localise your search terms (in other words, search for something within a particular country, although this isn't always working with ddg).
and so on...
