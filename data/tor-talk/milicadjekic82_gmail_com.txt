I would suggest to talk a bit more about the defense operations regarding
an organized crime and terrorism that could get conducted using
well-planned insider's tasks and TOR's capacities.
Thank you so much.

The TOR's defense operations may include a careful preparing of the TOR's
environment to appear as the criminal or terrorist one and to get
convenient to those sort of people.
The skillful intelligence and defense agents could get their insider's
tasks within their organizations and attempt to attract some population of
harmful individuals to join the TOR's surrounding.
For such an operation, the good strategy is necessary to get formulated and
lots of intelligence gathered in order to decide how to approach that
operation. Would anyone get any idea how TOR could get used to defense
It's getting obvious that once the bad guys got within a TOR and captured
by security community, they would get easier investigated and removed.
Also, many defense officers could maintain a communication with the bad
guys as a part of their insider's roles.
