@_subject: [tor-talk] **SPAM** This video has been censored by YouTube 
Welcome to Tor Talk! This is a place where ordinary people can talk about Tor usability and security problems. Since this is a technical mailing list, I strong suggest:
If you don't want your video to be censored, consider setting up a Tor hidden service, an I2P hidden service, a Freenet site or an IPFS upload.
YouTube's censorship of a video appears to be really trivial with the presence anonymity tools. Now let's come back, calm down and start to talk about the really serious things.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser crash 
Hello, Tor Talk!
Tor Browser crashes very predictably when I click some menu items of the NoScript plugin.
Tor Browser 6.5.1 on Ubuntu
Steps to reproduce:
1. Security slider: High
2. Go to this Medium article 3. When the page is still loading, open the NoScript toolbar menu, and CLICK on "Blocked Objects"
4. Tor browser exits.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser crash 
Hello! The crash is not consistent, but when it happens, it appears to be a really strange crash. The same happened on some other webpages in which the "Blocked Objects" menu showed up. I just reproduced the crash again on Ubuntu 64bit. What I did is I repeatedly clicked on "Blocked Objects" right after a page was loaded. Tor browser window closed immediately. I cannot determine the reason of crash, and I did not see the crash reporter for segfault show up.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser crash 
I attached a screen recording showing Tor Browser crash.
Strangely enough, I couldn't reproduce the crash in a virtual machine with Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit installed. I doubt the crash has something to do with screen resolution and the "Scale for menu and title bars" feature of Unity. (?)
My display settings: Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit with Unity desktop environment. On a computer with HiDPI screen. Change the screen resolution to 3840x2160 (4k) resolution. Change "Scale for menu and title bars" to 2.5x
0:02 I selected a new circuit for that site.
0:05 I clicked on the NoScript (S) icon and wait for page to reload. I did not click on any NoScript menu item at that moment.
0:07 - 0:11 Still waiting for page to reload and waiting for the "Blocked object" menu item to appear. I did not click on any NoScript menu item at that moment.
0:17 My cursor was on the "Blocked object" menu item. I started repeatedly clicking on this menu item.
0:19 I clicked on the NoScript icon (S) to make the drop down menu disappear. I clicked on it again immediately to make the menu reappear.
0:20 I moved my cursor onto the "Blocked object" menu item. This time, Tor browser window was gone after I clicked on the "Blocked object" menu item only once.
6.5.1 (based on Mozilla Firefox 45.8.0)
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (64-bit), default Unity desktop environment
The default ones.
Extensions: HTTPS Everywhere, NoScript, TorButton, TorLauncher.
Plugins: None
Services: None
Downloadable fonts were blocked in "High" security level mode.
When I had to temporarily allow scripts for that page, I clicked on the NoScript (S) icon and immediately selected the first menu item, but that page contains downloadable fonts, so the first menu item does not say "Temporarily allow all this page" but says "Blocked objects." So by mistake I clicked on the "Block objects" menu item. Tor Browser then crashed.
Later when I wanted to reproduce the crash, I had to click on the menu item said "Blocked objects" many times in order to make Tor Browser crash.

I make a correction here: I just reproduced the crash in a virtual machine, but it took a few attempts to reproduce.
Virtual machine OS: Ubuntu server 16.04 64-bit with lxde desktop environment.
TBB version: 6.5.1 with default plugins.
Steps to reproduce:
Repeat the steps described in the screen recording.
After a few attempts, Tor Browser window was suddenly gone.
Click on the shortcut icon to start Tor Browser again. It does not say "Tor Browser is running."

@_subject: [tor-talk] (Correction) Tor Browser crash 
Hello! I reproduced the crash without clicking on the menu items fast. Generally, I found that if I click on the "Blocked Objects" menu item when the sub menu's _shadow effect_ is being drawn, Tor browser crashes.
I don't have to click on it frequently to make Tor browser crash. If I click when the _shadow_ of the menu is being drawn, Tor browser crashes.
I don't think this is really related to this crash. I think it's not the problem of the Medium page, but it might be something wrong with NoScript's UI, but anyway it is shown in the recording.

- Disable javascript and visit Now Google will only give you a simple CAPTCHA of some letters.
- Visit This is a privacy Google proxy in Germany.
- Visit Google with "free web proxies"
Some people run proxies because they want to steal passwords and collect private information, but it doesn't matter much if we use these free proxies over Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Teaching people to use Tor 
Hello, Tor Teachers!
I am a hobbyist programmer from Asia, where the general public don't use Tor. My spare time job is raise people's awareness on mass surveillance and teach them how to protect their identities on the Internet when they are doing sensitive, controversial and semi-illegal activities.
- Tor is heavily censored in China. Internet is heavily censored in China. But people don't know how Internet censorship works. Though there is a big firewall, many people don't know how will digital surveillance affects their safety. The general computer users are more than eager to install govt-sponsored adware and spyware to use the Internet more conveniently [1]. Web browsers from China don't check for HTTPS certificates and Man in middle attacks. Citizen Labs caught Baidu on spying on their users. [2]
[1] [2] - Tor is not used widely in Japan, though Japan does not have heavy Internet censorship. They prefer to use "homemade" software, for example the close source, discontinued P2P software Perfect Dark [1], which is not safe at all.
[1] - Controversial events occurred, which has the potential raise people's awareness of privacy, anonymity and mass surveillance.
    (On extraorbitant profits) Theories suggest a Chinese video streaming company filed complaints to Kyoto cyber police, asking local police to arrest Chinese college students:     (On legality) Chinese headlines suggest it is the first case in which Japanese cyber police actually took action to arrest people for torrenting. Before that, torrenting in Japan is a grey area.
    (On public anger) Protest in Hong Kong against police arresting fansubbers:  (Use StartPage proxy to see it)
    (On lack of security knowledge) People don't know how BitTorrent works. Many technical discussions afterwards still recommend future people use unreliable OPSEC methods, including using the Baidu Drive over HTTP port 80, using WinRAR volumes to "destroy traffic feature" and, using the defunct Perfect Dark.
My methods:
- I need to test and evaluate these software first. Many software has confusing translations, and has bugs handling file system encoding.
For example, OnionShare and Stem don't work on my computer. I doubt it is that the directory name contains Chinese characters. I emailed OnionShare and Stem developer about this.
- Despite that I am a little bit late, I still need to teach the general people how to use anonymity and privacy software, in a way easy to understand, easy to memorize and hard to censor.
I tried to translate tutorials into familiar memes, so people will hopefully feel obvious to use anonymity software.
A modern Chinese meme goes like this: a forum moderator [*] wanted to teach people how to take screenshots, so he pretended to be a professional (a professional on taking screenshots), showed three obvious ways of taking screenshots on Windows 7: (1) Ma Hua Teng [**] presses the big button in his chat software; (2) dear Bill Gates presses the big button which says "Snipping tool"; (3) "The God of Computer" presses the big button on the keyboard. In the last picture, it says: "This is you. You still want to use cellphone camera in front of computer screen." [***]
[*] [**] [***] I want to making using anonymity software obvious, too. I made a poster in the meme style, pretending to be a pseudonymous professional, to raise curiosity first, and showed what celebrities in computer world want "you" to use, but what "you" decided to use at last. I even created a printable version: At last, the problem I am aware of after making this, is that using these software doesn't seem to be easy. Tor Browser comes without many required configurations, has a straightforward UI design, but this is not the case for I2P, Tahoe-LAFS and RetroShare. There is still many work to make anonymity software more accessible to computer beginners, which requires not only developers' effort but also public awareness and support.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Teaching people to use Tor 
I think both. There is poor documentation translation, poor UI translation and sometimes there are glitches of handling Chinese file names.
Many Chinese people don't read English fluently. I saw the newish ZeroNet has very good documentation translation done by its volunteer users [1], has very simple and beautiful UI, and has attracted a lot of Chinese people. [2] Unfortunately ZeroNet is not primarily for secret communications. (No private sites.) [3]

@_subject: [tor-talk] Just some updates on "Use Privacy Software, 
Hello, Tor Talk and Privacy Enthusiasts!
Here are some small updates about my hobbyist project "Teach and encourage people to use Tor."
1. I emailed Damian Johnson, the Stem developer, about the wide character handling bug, which makes Stem fail to authenticate when Tor executable's path contains Chinese or Japanese characters. This bug has been fixed now.
2. The content in my GitHub repo [1] is written in a style that young people in China, Japan and possibly other countries can easily accept. It might appear strange to a different group of audience.
[1] 3. My GitHub repo got views from Reddit, Facebook and komica.org image board. Though no stars, it gains a little bit of popularity.
4. News: [2] On Feb. 16th, Chinese man arrested in Japan for illegally uploading cartoon episodes (I guess via peer-to-peer software). Police typically won't take action if the amount of uploaded data does not exceed a certain threshold. Up to now, at least 4 Chinese people have been arrested for torrenting without any protection, over a monitored network. Lesson learned: when doing something controversial or semi-illegal, know your threats. When you have a basic understanding of the threat model, you don't unconsciously put yourself in danger. For example, though not necessarily enough, that guy should at least use some basic protection such as VPN.
[2] 5. Got spikes on traffic graph on Feb. 18th and 19th. Most of them are not unique viewers. (People were reviewing what they read?)
6. Got questions from Reddit: "Why is it exclusively in Chinese? Readers may need translation."  "Why is it addressed specifically to fansubbers? You may want to expand it to larger audience."  "Since this is the theme, you can write about the specific threats and defenses for fansubbers."
I am trying to add more content, both general to all and specific to fansubs, and English translations are coming very soon.
7. I quickly searched the web and read through the comments general Chinese netizens left under the discussions of the Feb. 16th news. I saw people mention public key encryption and "multi-hop VPN":
Generally, I saw better comments, in contrast with last year's comments, which I mentioned in my previous email. Comment writers demonstrated a basic grasp of encryption concept and its importance. The most interesting comment is:
Well, it is Tor, The Onion Router, or TBB, the Tor Browser Bundle. Both its name and its traffic are heavily censored in China, but I believe people in Japan have easier access to Tor software and Tor network.
8. I am writing about why the proprietary and inactive Perfect Dark [3] is not OK. It is obvious to us, but the audience is the general Chinese young people. I am trying to encourage readers to switch to free libre open source privacy software and well-studied, more reliable anonymity networks. I have listed the reasons, both generally and specifically why Perfect Dark is not safe.
[3] - It has not been updated for a year.
- It is closed source, proprietary software. You can hardly check if the software behaves correctly. Note that even security experts can get a headache auditing things by reverse engineering.
- "You are too weak." It is using weak crypto -- RSA-1024. Now HTTPS certificates using RSA-1024 are being revoked!
- Japanese cyber agency claims to have software used to decipher the traffic of Perfect Dark. They claimed they were able to get the metadata of the files being shared. But limited research effort had been made to figure out how the cyber agency did it. The links to the sources are dead.
I could only think of these 4 reasons. Any other suggestions on the reasons?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Building a new censorship circumvention tool: what 
Very interesting design!
For a censorship circumvention tool to work in China, you need to follow these necessary guidelines:
1. Obfuscation and anti-DPI. Have a look at shadowsocks. (  ) It is an obfuscated proxy. Handshakes and application data are AES encrypted without fixed header. Recently they added fake HTTP header to get around simple DPI rules. This is not enough though.
There is an experimental pluggable transport designed specifically to get around DPI, called Dust (  ) Unfortunately it became inactive.
2. Simulate Meek design and Collateral Freedom (  ) The Great Firewall agent can't block cloud computing platforms and big VPS providers because of their importance.
3. Peer-to-peer: The getlatern team claims it has integrated peer-to-peer data transfer mechanism to their software. Peer-to-peer makes the IP addresses abundant, and trivial to block.
By the way, the Great Firewall designer claimed to have invented a way to detect meek traffic by looking at packet sizes and timing, a simple, dirty and stupid DPI trick. New censorship circumvention tools MUST NOT send packets with easily detectable DPI features.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question about less frequently used function of Tor 
There are some less frequently used functions in Tor Browser, such as the developer tools, developer toolbar, customization and Sync.
Some are very useful. I can use the F12 developer tools to remove unwanted elements that are supposed to be removed only if you enable JavaScript. Sometimes I use the developer toolbar to take screenshots of a page. They are just not used frequently because we don't primarily use Tor Browser to write websites.
I noticed that these developer tools saves its own states and history.
In normal Firefox. F12 developer tools will pop up a warning dialog when you first use Ctrl-V to paste code snippet into it. After you type "allow pasting" the dialog is gone forever.
In normal Firefox, F12 developer tools also saves history. If you press UP arrow key, you get what you have typed in the console yesterday.
✓ Good news: Tor Browser F12 console does not save history. If you click "New Identity" You can still browse your input history in the F12 console, but the history is gone after you close Tor Browser completely.
？ It did not ask me to type "allow pasting" when I use Ctrl-V. I don't know if I have typed that in before, or was the Tor browser optimized for this.
ㄨ In Tor Browser, the Developer Toolbar (which you can use to take screenshots) saves its own state and it persists after you close and restart Tor Browser.
In normal Firefox, when you open the Developer Toolbar for the first time, you will see a tip dialog and a "Got it" button. From then on the tip dialog is gone forever. The same behavior is present in Tor Browser. I saw the tip dialog. I clicked "Got it". I closed and restarted Tor Browser, opened the Developer Toolbar again. Then I did not see the tip dialog.
✓ Good news: the Developer Toolbar does not save input history. (I can't see input history by pressing the UP arrow key)
☆ Isn't Tor Browser supposed to save as fewer "states" as possible?
Some other less frequently used functions also save their own states to the disk.
？ With Customization, you can rearrange the plugin icons. Modification to the user interface persists even after you close and restart Tor Browser. I don't know if it's an expected behavior or not.
？ If you go to [Alt key] -- View -- Sidebar and enable any of these sidebars, you can still see the sidebar shown on the left even after closed and restarted Tor Browser (if you don't close the sidebars). I don't know if this is expected or not.
？ The same with bookmark bar. I don't know if this is expected or not.
？ I think no one will use "Sign in to Sync" in Tor Browser, and it doesn't work because most of use have adjusted security settings and don't want to enable JavaScript.

@_subject: [tor-talk] A Pluggable Transport based on i2p? 
You might be able to hide the fact that you are using Tor, but there is no pluggable transports for I2P you can use to hide the fact that you are using I2P, at least to my knowledge. When I2P developers talk about "anonymity", they are talking about the difficulty to determine what did you do on I2P. Router IPs are still visible. Exposing router IPs is okay in places where a lot of people are using I2P to do different kind of things, but in places where I2P is rarely used, for example, China, it is very suspicious to use I2P in a frequent manner without protection. I use I2P with a VPN.
Another disappointing aspect of I2P is that there is no "preferable" implementation. The Java implementation runs on a potentially vulnerable runtime environment. The C++ implementation, I2Pd, is still error-prone. I was playing with the SAM protocol of I2Pd. When I typed some control characters by pressing some Ctrl+Alphabet keys in telnet window, the I2Pd on the other side crashed with a seg fault. It really freaked me out.

@_author: m.ajiao@tuta.io 
@_subject: [tor-talk] A Pluggable Transport based on i2p? 
Unfortunately even after a lot of trying, I was unable to reproduce the seg fault, but I did discover that I2Pd's SAM protocol parser [1] is kind of broken.
[1] SAM protocol parameter parser: 'NAMING LOOKUP NAME=zzz.i2p\x20\n' If you don't type a trailing space, the naming lookup command fails.
SESSION CREATE STYLE={STREAM,DATAGRAM,RAW} ID=$nickname DESTINATION={$privkey,TRANSIENT}
In this interesting case, if you type in the parameters exactly in that order, and use 'DESTINATION=TRANSIENT' but you forgot to add a trailing space, you will get a private key full of A's.
I don't know if a private key full of A's is secure. Fortunately i2p.socket SAM protocol wrapper places the parameters in a different order.
I reported to their dev forum and Orignal, the dev, replied:
I agree I should return an error in this case.
Basically he meant as the opposite of the spec, I2Pd will try to parse the bytes 'TRANSIENT' as a private key, rather than regarding it as a keyword.
Detailed discussion here: Response format from I2Pd:
Session Creation Response
If the creation was successful:
<-  SESSION STATUS RESULT=OK DESTINATION=$privkey
The $privkey is the base 64 of the concatenation of the Destination [1] followed by the Private Key [2] followed by the Signing Private Key [3], which is 663 or more bytes in binary and 884 or more bytes in base 64, depending on signature type. The binary format is specified in Private Key File.
[1] Destination: [2] Private Key: [3] Signing Private Key:  Here I attached two responses I got from I2Pd SAM protocol. To help you see special characters easily, I escaped the messages in python repr format.
I sent: 'SESSION CREATE STYLE=STREAM ID=This_is_another_test DESTINATION=TRANSIENT\n'

Hello, Joe!
I understand that some modified versions of Firefox (such as Canonical Firefox and firefox.com.cn Firefox) are annoying, suspicious and hard to tune, but Tor Browser Bundle requires NO installation. It is portable. Just extract and run! It can also automatically update!
