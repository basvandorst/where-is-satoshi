As it happens I have already gone ahead and tried setting up the  server and it is working fine, as you said it would.

@_subject: Tor Installation fails on Mac 
It has been a while since I have run Tor and wanted to get current and  configure a server.  I pulled down the installations bundles, both  2.0.35-0.1.14-universal and 2.1.16-rc-0.1.14-universal.  I'm trying to  do the installation on my Intel Mac running OX X 10.5.7 and Firefox  3.5.  When I run the installation bundle it gets partway through and  then I get the failure message: "Install Failed.  The following  install step failed: run postflight script for Tor."  If I look at the  console I see this:
6/30/09 4:05:20 PM runner[44595] postflight[44638]: /Applications/ Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin: /Applications/Firefox.app/ Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin: cannot execute [Exec format error]
6/30/09 4:05:20 PM runner[44595] postflight[44638]:

I can run firefox-bin from the command line copying and pasting the  path.  I made sure Firefox wasn't already running.  I also tried a  custom install with the Torbutton turned off but still got the error.   Any ideas?
