I am having a problem in making Tor work. Below, you will find a description of the problem together with background information.
System installation information
MS Windows XP SP2
Firefox 3.01 + SwitchProxy add-on
Vidalia 0.1.5
Tor 0.2.0.30(r15956)
Qt 4.4.0
Privoxy 3.0.8
JonDo client 00.10.003
Vidalia is configured to send Tor traffic via proxy (127.0.0.1 via port When I configure Firefox to use Tor, and then I use either  or  to test my system's IP address, the IP reported is my system's actual IP address.
When I configure Firefox to use the JonDo client,  and  for my system report an anonymous IP address.
The test to check that Tor is running on my system ( is successful).
I cannot figure out why JonDo wokrs and Tor does not.
I would appreciate any help in resolving this matter.

Thanks for your help. Your suggestion worked. Now, vidalia cannot start Tor but I suspect it's a Vidalia problem. When I start Tor outside of Vidalia it works and making the configuration change you suggested gets the desired result.

I installed tor-0.2.1.7-alpha-dev-win32.exe, deleted torrc from the Vidalia
Application Data directory, and started Vidalia.
So far, so good, Tor is configured to run as a relay node (nessuno), and seems
to be running normally. The logs appear to be normal (no warnings or errors).
Please let me know if you need any information or you would like me to do
something to verify that the problem I reported on 11/30 (sorry I deleted the
messages related to the posting) was resolved by tor-0.2.1.7-alpha-dev-win32.exe

A few days ago I posted the message below asking for help to resolve a problem
that prevents me from running a Tor relay node. I have not received any responses.
I would like to continue to run a Tor relay node but am unable to do so until I
resolve the problem described below, and I need help in order to do that.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

0.2.1.7 in relay node configuration has been running apparently normally for the
last 30 hours.
The only message (recurring) in the log is:
Dec 05 07:45:26.964 [Notice] We stalled too much while trying to write 179 bytes

My Internet connection is FIOS (fiber from Verizon), and I don't seem to be
having problems with it.

Thanks for the response. I understand. Below, you will find the copy of the
Vidalia generated torrc.
The problem is occurring on a system running MS Windows XP SP2.
Note that prior to the upgrade from 0.2.0.31 to 0.2.1.7 I had no problems. The
problems started occurring as soon as I started Tor again via Vidalia after the
upgrade. Also note that I do not have any problems running the Tor client.
torrc from Document and Settings\\Application Data\Vidalia
# This file was generated by Tor; if you edit it, comments will not be preserved
# The old torrc file was renamed to torrc.orig.1 or similar, and Tor will ignore it
# If set, Tor will accept connections from the same machine (localhost only)
# on this port, and allow those connections to control the Tor process using
# the Tor Control Protocol (described in control-spec.txt).

I replaced the current ttorrc with the one labeled "old". Tor still cannot run
as a relay node but the error messages have changed. Here they are:

I just upgraded to versions
0.1.10 of Vidalia
0.2.1.7 of Tor
Vidalia is able to run Tor as a client without any problems.
However, when I try to configure and run it as a relay node Vidalia is not able
to run Tor and reports the warnings and error you will find below.
Please note that up until I upgraded the software, Tor was running as a relay
node. I made no configuration changes either before or after the upgrade.
The only two attempts at trying to fix the problems were:
1) Rename the Tor configuration file
2) Re-start the system

True, I did take that into account. I could be mistaken but I think the main
problem lies with the proxy software. I think that Polipo and, especially,
Privoxy are pretty resource intensive, and affect performance more than Tor
itself. But, this is just an educated guess not based on any measurement.

For the past month or so, I have been unable to consistently run web searches

Every time I try to use Google, the response to a search is a page asking me to
enter a character sequence (I guess Google thinks the search is being run by a bot)

When I do that, I frequently get a 403 response, or a strange search result
