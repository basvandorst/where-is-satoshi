@_subject: [tor-talk] Looking for Google Season of Docs mentors 
Hello tor-talk!
Are there any Tor contributors willing to be mentors for the upcoming
Google Season of Docs program [1]?
    1: Season of Docs involves technical writers working on documentation for
open source projects for about three months. It's similar to Summer of
Code which Tor has participated in previously. This is the first year
it's running.
If Tor wanted to participate it would require one or two people to act
as organization administrators and one or more mentors. In return,
technical writers would get to contribute to Tor's documentation with
a stipend being paid for by Google. The deadline for organizations to
apply is April 23 [2].
    2: I'm a technical writer and this is something I would really like to
be involved in. My personal interest is explaining protocols in a
format that can be understood by readers even if those people are not
necessarily hardcore internet protocol fans <3
Here are examples of documentation I have written for the Dat [3] and
Scuttlebutt [4] projects:
    3:     4: I am drawn to Tor because of the knowledge about how to build real-world
privacy enhancing software boiled into Tor's design. I think there
are some good candidates where accessible documentation could help
others understand what Tor has learned, for example the path selection
algorithm. I'm also open to hearing ideas about other aspects of Tor's
documentation that would most benefit from having a dedicated person
working on them for a few months.
But first I'm just looking to see if mentoring technical writers is
something Tor people are interested in, especially seeing as a chance to
fund this is coming up.

Thank you Pili for leading this! I'm really glad to hear this is in
already being worked on.
I'm going to dig a bit deeper into Tor's current docs, specs and papers
to put together some other ideas for projects that might fit into the
three month window.
