@_subject: [tor-talk] Adblock Plus and Ghostery should be included in Tor 
For me, a more basic question is whether installing extensions from a fresh Tor installed is (sufficiently) safe....
Very real problem
see -
watch the slides from 140 onward.  Firefox/thunderbird case study
detailing just this problem.

Agreed about the dangers of add-ons and info here
"The Design and Implementation of the Tor Browser [DRAFT]"
not sure if maintaining ghostery or adblock via Tor is worth the trouble as they might/might not improve the user experience but they don't from my standpoint push forward the design and implementation goals.  I would say a first consideration might be to address mitm attacks.
We have seen major problems with certificate authorities and most governments can write certificates.  Tor has a vulnerability with mitm attacks. (everyone does)  A migration towards a system like convergence (convergence.io) with a decentralized trust of SSL would probably be a good thing.  Currently there are some conflicts between Tor and the convergence add-on working together but if this could be addressed or the process was internalized and if Tor was shipped with a large number of notaries (or approach this in the same way as bridges...not sure on this) then you would have a pretty complete solution.
my 2 cents
