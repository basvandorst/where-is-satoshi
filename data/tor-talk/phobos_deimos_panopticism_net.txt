@_subject: [tor-talk] Any risks with another application using Tor's SOCKS 
How else would any application access the Tor network? This is exactly
how, e.g., Firefox in the Tor Browser Bundle works -- by pointing it at
Tor's SOCKS5 proxy.
If you want to use additional applications, you might edit torrc so that
Tor listens on additional ports. IIUC, each one of those will build/use
separate circuits. I don't remember where but I recall coming across
suggestions to do just that -- use different ports -- for various
applications (e.g. one port for your browser, a different port for your
mail client, yet another for an IRC client, and so on).
