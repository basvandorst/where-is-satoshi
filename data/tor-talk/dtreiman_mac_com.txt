I'm tentatively interested - I have some servers and the bandwidth.   (I'm in the US, with locations in Minnesota and Texas).
Let me know how this would work.

@_subject: Running a Tor exit node on an academic network? 
First off, congratulations on getting approval.
I'll take you up on that offer; if you wouldn't mind sending me a  copy of the proposal.  I've been running a tor server on my campus  network for a semester (without permission) and I've been lucky that  the IT folks haven't noticed yet :-).  But it would be a much better  solution to just go legit - its about time I started looking into that.
