Considering I2P's German home I think you should go back to what others have
said, it's not a matter of Legal, it's a matter of reducing activity that
might raise the alarm of other people. So read the links sent, consider the
port limitations, and work up from there.
If you really need to find something more concrete then consider contacting
EFF and EFF Europe projects ( Good
luck, -Ali

I find it curious that ~credibility~ of tor is being called into
question by some. The source is readily available, the libraries it
compiles against are readily available, the change logs, code control
records, etc. are all readily available. Certain contributors to tor
have come under fire from various Governments and private
institutions. For bloody sin sake EVERYTHING has had Uncle Sam
involved in some variable way at this point. Linux, GCC, sendmail,
bind, etc. etc.
FUD is an energy stealer and if you can afford that energy loss then
at least put it to good use auditing and tracking down bugs or any
backdoors you suppose. -Ali

Alright, I can understand your argument and you and Roger are speaking
from experience.
And I like this version of a FOSSH response. Thanks for the education, -Ali
