@_subject: [tor-talk] US Senators Seek to Crackdown on Bitcoin 
Bitcoin is a scam.  Money or value can't be created on a computer
(unless you consider the phoney fiat currency of the USD "money").  At
best bitcoin is a ponzi scheme where the initial holders of the digital
money get to see the increase in the computer value of the bitcoins they
"own" only to, at the right time, dump them onto suckers that got in the
this new fangled trickery at the end.  Those that hold bitcoins at the
end will be at a loss as in reality, they're worth nothing.  Bitcoins
are a classic example of the Wall Street method of Pump and Dump.  Fake
or unrealistic information is circulated around the web about a certain
stock and how it's to perform which is always UP UP UP in value.  This
is the Pump phase.  The unsuspecting and gulible public rushes in to
purchase massive amounts of the (really) junk stock.  The price rises
dramaticly.  Those that promoted the stock then Dump it....fast.  They
make their profit and the dummies that believed the junk about how great
the equity was get stuck with a loss as the stock plummets.  Whether the jackasses in the Senate want to go after bc or not doesn't
matter.  Bitcoin will evaporate under its own weight with no help of the
government.

Bitcoin fails on point 1 above as the market place and suppliers of the
unit of exchange (money) can determine quantity and not some stupid
computer.  That's exactly what the Federal Reserve is doing now with
their "quantitative easing" (inflation) methods.  Bitcoin fails on point 2 above as someone will be able to figure out how
to counterfeit a digital quantity.  Let's see you counterfeit a 1 ounce
Gold or Silver piece.
Bitcoins are worthless and have no value.
Here's an article about Bitcoin from LewRockwell.com
June 9, 2011
Bitcoin: Just Another Bogus Medium of Exchange
Posted by David Kramer on June 9, 2011 03:00 PM
I'm sure by now many of you have heard about Bitcoin. The fact that it's
called "virtual currency" gives you an idea about its actual value as a
real medium of exchange. While many people who are touting it on
Facebook are enamored with the fact that it was voluntarily created by
the marketplace (i.e., is not forced down our throats by a private
central bank), I'm afraid that those people are losing sight of how a
real medium of exchange arises in a free market. A medium of exchange
arises from something that had a material use/value in the market prior
to becoming a medium of exchange, i.e., it was also a good being bartered for other goods and services. Over the centuries, the
commodities gold and silver won out as the two most preferred mediums of
exchange?with gold holding the number one position due to its being more
scarce than silver.
What was Bitcoin's prior material use/value? Zero. It is just bits in a
computer. And what's with the "fixed" amount of Bitcoins? Who/what
determined the "proper" amount of 21 million for Bitcoins to top out at?
A computer program? (Next we'll find out what the proper minimum wage
should be.) Only the free market can voluntarily determine how much of a
real medium of exchange is needed in the marketplace over time. While
the idea of  attempting to get rid of the Bankster monopoly on creating
money out of thin air is commendable, Bitcoin is also money created out
of thin air. Bitcoin is just substituting one bogus medium of exchange
for another.
UPDATE: I've been getting a lot of reader response trying to "explain"
to me the economic virtues of Bitcoin. Some responders have even
mistakenly used Austrian economics to rationalize their views. I would
suggest that before you write to me about the Austrian economics view of
a medium of exchange, you should read the two books by one of the two
giants of Austrian economics, Murray Rothbard, on what a medium of
exchange is. Here is the pdf for Rothbard's What Has Government Done to
Our Money and here is the pdf for Rothbard's The Case Against the Fed.
For those of you who have not yet read any Austrian economics, please do
not waste your time writing to me trying to explain the "scientific"
breakthrough of the bogus Bitcoin computer program. (There already was a
REAL digital currency, e-gold, that was backed by a real commodity until
the Federalistas shut it down. Eventually, Bitcoin will be shut down too
because of its anonymity capabilities.)
 Check out Mises.org of and search for more information about money and
 what it is.

I could read those responses until the end of time and wouldn't
understand anything.
Could you tell me what I'm supposed to enter in Terminal to get a
response that indicates a good file or a bad file?
Here's what I entered (2 separate ways);
$ gpg --verify tor-browser-linux32-4.0.4_en-US.tar.xz.asc gpg: Signature made Wed 25 Feb 2015 02:54:55 AM EST using RSA key ID

@_subject: [tor-talk] Problems? Verifying signatures in Tor 4.0.4 
When run in Terminal this is what happens;
$ gpg --verify tor-browser-linux32-4.0.4_en-US.tar.xz.asc
tor-browser-linux32-4.0.4_en-US.tar.xz gpg: Signature made Wed 25 Feb 2015 02:54:55 AM EST using RSA key ID
gpg: BAD signature from "Tor Browser Developers (signing key)
I have no idea what all of this means but when I see something that says
"BAD signature" that tells me something is wrong.
Is the tar.xz file bad and suspect?
What must be done to fix this?

Thanks for the help but I have no idea if the Tor files I have a good or
Here's the output from terminal;
$ gpg --verify tor-browser-linux32-4.0.4_en-US.tar.xz.asc
gpg: Signature made Wed 25 Feb 2015 02:54:55 AM EST using RSA key ID
gpg: BAD signature from "Tor Browser Developers (signing key)
Are these files good or bad and not to be trusted? If not to be trusted
which aren't to be trusted?

Ok....I think that makes it very clear. Excellent work and thanks for
your time.

Even cheaper than that- when the House of (corporate) Representatives
has a bill before it to fund or reduce funding for the DHS then the
entire world is flooded with the idiotic "what color is this dress"
distraction. What a strange coincidence.

Simple- to know what the Tor project is doing. It's the "golden rule" He
who has the Gold makes the rules.

Consider the killing of innocent people as an aggregate no matter who
they are or what they believe or what they look like. It's true that the
German government, at the time, sent millions to their deaths in the
concentration camps. Maybe the figure is around 10 million? Most of the killing was of Jewish people.
Everyone likes to pick on the Germans/Nazis.
What the Germans did is insignificant to what the Soviet Union did in
their prison camp system and the Red Chinese have done.
Another example of hypocrisy is America. There's no government
established killing camp system but at least 50 million have been
murdered since 1972/73 through abortion. In all of the former examples
it was deemed that there is a life not worth living and they aren't
really "people". Such is how "the freest country in the world" values
human life. Change the language and it's all the same.

Is TorChat the usual program used for IRC?
Or, there another irc client that's recommended?
Where can it be downloaded from?  There seem to be way too many places
to download TorChat.

Thanks Moritz.  It's somewhat disconcerting to see that you have to
register with these irc networks with some email address and nick
(unless I am mistaken).
