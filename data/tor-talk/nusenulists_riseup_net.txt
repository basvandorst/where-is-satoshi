 With the growing number of sites deploying HSTS, the impact is even bigger.

* what version do you use
* your torrc configuration file
* how do you start tor
* how does it fail if you do not modify the service file (you did include the logs in your first email)
If it fails, this might be a bug in fedora's service file, in which case
we should report it in fedora's bugzilla.
tor-master.service is just there to ensure that all tor instances
are reloaded/restarted when needed (for example when logrotate happens or when the tor package is upgraded), see /etc/logrotate.d/tor
and the first few lines in tor.service and tor at .service.
..but you probably will not need anything from tor-master.service directly.

not directly but close enough onionoo provides data in json.
The relevant fields are: or_addresses (which contain ports and need postprocessing)
exit_addresses (more than one per exit is possible)
I can only guess what Tor_ip_list_EXIT.csv contains, but if that is OR addresses of exits
then this is something slightly different than the above onionoo URL (which is able to show
exit IP addresses based on active measurements at least for IPv4)
To direct your users to existing data it would be great if you could
display some info on your page about the upcoming shutdown and replace the content of the CSV files

@_subject: [tor-talk] exit ports to open in relay *without* issue... 
before tackling the actual question, a short description of how detection of malware activity is
usually performed in this context - at least in the context of these kinds of "abuse" emails:
* organizations like shadowservers [1] and others operate sinkhole servers that listen
for incoming connections on IPs or domains used by malware (i.e. former C&C server)
* everytime they get a connection to their sinkhole systems they write down where the connection came from (i.e. your exit IP address)
* then they automatically inform that IP holder (usually the AS abuse contact or a national CERT of the
country where the AS is located) of that registered event since it is a sign of a potential
infection of the source IP
This makes sense for most of the internet, unfortunately this methodology of source IP based attribution
causes "abuse" emails for Tor exits when infected clients (or security researchers or anyone) visits sinkhole IPs via
their Tor.
- you can not solve this based on a port level because ports 80 and 443 is frequently used
by malware for outbound connections and 80+443 is required for the exit flag
- there is a methodology to reduce the amount of such emails that does not get you the BadExit flag:
blacklisting sinkhole IPs in your exit policy, but these are not generally public.
There are lists of IP addresses of such sinkholes that exit operators could use in their exit policy but the problem is:
- they can not be comprehensive (sinkhole IPs try to remain secret)
- they can contain false positives
- they might contain old IPs
- there trustworthiness is unknown
In a little side project I'm aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of these sinkhole lists
by correlating them with such related "abuse" notifications to answer the questions:
Do these public sinkhole IP list match IPs from actual sinkhole IPs mentioned in abuse notifications?
How effective would using these IPs in a Tor exit relay's ExitPolicy be at reducing the amount of such notification emails?
How much overblocking would occur?
How static are these lists?
If you are an exit operator and want to help with that little project you can submit information covering
such cases in a specific CSV format to the email address bellow.
To prevent getting spammed the email must be send from the email address mentioned in the relay's ContactInfo field following this spec:
and you should not send more than one email per day per sender. (plus points for DKIM signed emails)
**Please do NOT submit data that is related to other types of abuse emails**
CSV format:
timestamp,destination IP address,destination port,feed-name
timestamp: YYYY-MM (please do not include more fine grained time information)
destination IP address: IPv4 or IPv6 address (mandatory)
destination port (if available)
feed-name (if available) example value: shadowserver-drone

the tor exit relay "BSDNow2016" [1] reroutes traffic back into the tor network instead of exiting it.
It uses other exits instead of being
an actual exit. This allows it to inspect traffic without having to deal with abuse.
I've no evidence that this exit actually inspects traffic.
This has been ongoing since the very first day of its operation (2019-02-10) [2].
It got reported on 2019-02-11 and 2019-03-13 to bad-relays@
and two attempts to contact the operator remained with no reply.
The risk of your tor client choosing this exit relay is probably low due to its
low consensus weight.

I agree but I'm not in the position to do more about it than to send a bunch of emails. (and honestly I believe there are bigger issues

Since you are a tor core member I believe
it should be fairly easy for you to get access to the relevant git repo, send a pre-notice to bad-relays@

Reply-To: researcher_2o17 Hi nusenu,
I am sorry for taking so long to reply.
I understand the safety guidelines. I am currently doing preliminary research using my relay nodes. I would like to share my research if my research goes to the next step.
I am interested in the anonymity of Tor hidden service.There are several studies that use machine learning to identify the destination of traffic measured on the Tor network. I am currently conducting verification experiments of the method described in the papers.
The research is proceeded with careful consideration of the privacy of the Tor network users. Measured traffic is used to create data sets, but it does not contain information that can be used to break the anonymity of end-to-end communication. All my nodes are listed in the "family" of server descriptors, so people can completely exclude my nodes from their circuit paths if necessary.
Best regards,

I assume you want to know how fast they _could_ detect new exit IP addresses for most cases[0] not how frequently they actually update their exit lists since that can only be
answered by the specific site operator.
Exit IP address lists [1] are generated by The Tor Project by sending
traffic through exits and watching the used source IP address(es).
[0] ignoring corner cases that I did not observe in practice yet:
like potential exits rotating their exititing IP address at a rate < 1 hour
That list gets apparently published once an hour.
Maybe Iain or Karsten can add some documentation about how frequent the tests are done
for each exit.
[1] The way the question was asked suggests that jiggytwiggy at danwin1210.me
is referring to another type of blocking that is not the reaction
to abuse but the blocking of tor exit IPs - even if there is no
malicious activity detected.

with known issues like:
"Our systems have detected unusual traffic from your computer network. Please try your request again later."
but I believe the situation is worse than it could be.
In July last year I made a tor feature request that would help reduce
the impact of IP based reputation systems on tor users.
I believe such a feature is becoming more important and more feasible
as exit relays are increasingly deploying IPv6 connectivity.

Similar enhancement suggestions have been made already in 2011 by Mike Perry:

yes there are distribution strategies that can prevent that
or make that very expensive (an /48 IPv6 block has a **lot** of IP addresses)

No, I did not.
I don't think that anyone said Microsoft did run them.
They did run within the Microsoft ASN, which is not the same thing,
they are also a provider.

all of those that used to run at at Microsoft left (or got kicked?) on 2020-09-19 20:00
but no worries they keep pumping new relays into the network
and their fraction is impressive: at the beginning of the month (before many hibernate)

Georg Koppen:
I guess you mean "did not get kicked out by Dir Auths", maybe Microsoft did? Let's ask them.
tor's man page disagrees:
       ExcludeNodes node,node,...
           A list of identity fingerprints, country codes, and address
           patterns of nodes to avoid when building a circuit.

take care!
