@_subject: make win 2003 server use my tor server - newbie question 
found the faq that addresses the tor server side, but it doesnt address the client side.
here's the scenerio:
i have a working tor server :)
i want my windows 2003 server machine (differant box) to use the tor server.
(i'll call this one my 'client')
i edited my torrc file to add 'SocksListenAddress 192.168.1.99:9100'
which is the ip of my tor server.
(cable modem <-> router w/firewall <-> tor server)
so, i think i told tor to listen on interface 192.168.1.99 on port 9100.
on my client, i launch ie, then click Tools>Internet Options>Connections>Lan in the Proxy Server frame, i click Advanced.
i'm not sure what to put in the other protocols,
but i enter 192.168.1.99 with port 9100 in the socks textboxes.
cant reach the internet at all now...
what am i doing wrong?
