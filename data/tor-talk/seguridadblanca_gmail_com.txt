Last saturday during my Tor Talk in a Security Barcamp someone asked me
about this technology which I really don't have much information so I want
to share the link in case someone in here has any experience with this. I
heard some ISPs are using this in some countries to break into people's ssl

Try to ping tor entities from your relay, maybe your isp has blacklisted
the entities so you can't reach them, that happened to me, that was why I
wasn't getting listed.

I've made  this script to run TOR using
chromium without changing your network proxy settings. Hope you like it.
Just made it for fun and because I use chromium, just wanted to share with
you if you ever wanted to use TOR with chromium.
Thanks And Regards,

Thanks for this links, I had read them before, obviously never comparing
tor browser to chromium but actually chromium is open source so there's a
chance someone has a bug-fixed version of it, but this script was just for
those who want chromium as a gateway to Tor Network.
Thankd again for this links I will re-read them.

Hi, I made a very basic python script to help people setup their hidden
service. Maybe this could be useful for some people.

Just wanted to share that Hostgator, Virpus and CheapVPS did not accept my
payment for a VPS because I tryed to buy using Tor. Avoid using this
services providers when using tor, they don't respect privacy.
