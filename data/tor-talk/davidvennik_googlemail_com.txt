i'm somewhat concerned about your intelligence and/or cognitive ability
being that you must have acquired the link to this mailing list and the tor
software itself through tor.eff.org. may i suggest you consult a
psychiatrist about attention deficit medication? kindly of course. I am of
course biased about this topic but missing this important information at
sites you clearly must have visited says you have issues. no offense but
seriously. dude. sort it.
oh, don't expect a warm reception to my suggestion that you have an
attentional disorder.
may i point out that even so recently as 1981 methamphetamine was commonly
available as a prescription drug in high purity and precise dosages.
anyway, that's my hobby horse. so of course i am ranting.

the security risks are the same as running it without being hidden, except
vulnerabilities allowing the attacker to get the real ip address is the
major difference. i wouldn't think such exploits would be easily done
especially if one has told one's AMP servers to only accept connections from
localhost. anything which could give the attacker root would obviously allow
them to run ifconfig or ip to determine (oh, if the machine is windows,
ipconfig) the address of the network-facing ip, or if need be, the address
of the default gateway which is the public ip address. just something to be
aware of. any security holes will lead to compromise, the community is
always seeking to close such holes of course, being that such a large
portion of the internet depends on its integrity.

it's a good thing really, shows that public awareness of tor is rising.

well, on one hand, using tor is a sign of distrust towards server privacy
policies and the local police subpoena and warrant policies. which is
probably not unwarranted. the internet server fraternity is new to having
users who can cloak their identity, so naturally like most human responses
to new stimuli are wary.
i personally think tor is a good thing because it will force the issue of
strong authentication, because tor allows you to avoid origin-user mapping,
but this sholud never be any sign of authenticity anyway because it can be
easily subverted (trojans) and because users may be mobile and frequently
change their point of origin.

@_subject: accounting vs long lived nodes 
I use tor most often for irc, although I have recently shifted my
customary irc hangout to the ORC away from a little one i used to hang
out at, and on ORC tor proxying is a prerequesite.
As a user of tor with irc, it has become the most common bitch of anyone
i've talked to about the endless process of dying circuits, and while
thinking about it recently i realised there was one thing that could be
built into tor that would reduce the number of mis-guesses of long-lived
tor nodes: accounting!
If a node has bandwidth accounting, it should not be listed as long
lived, because obviously it is likely to go down at any moment. I don't
know if it will make that much difference to persistent session use on
tor or not, but I think that it is only logical that bandwidth
accounting should flag a 'not long lived' flag on the server information
so that circuits to irc and ssh and other long lived connections don't
use it. i know this might 'reduce anonymity' through the weakening of
defenses against traffic analysis, but endless reconnections to irc
servers, in my experience, is annoying both to myself and to the endless
timeouts in the ORC which is exclusively tor-accessible.

you are missing my point. if a node has bandwidth accounting configured
it may stay up for a week but it could hibernate in five seconds. this
is not helpful for users of persistent connection based services. some
kind of flag on the server description suggesting that the server is
liable to go offline at any time would be very useful for preventing the
endless string of timeouts that using tor for these kinds of connections

that's a good question, it sometimes does but sometimes not. i think it
depends on whether its the exit or entry node which dies, if the
middleman dies then neither end has a connection drop... i'm not sure
how it works, i'm sure someone who knows what happens can explain it to us

you assume too much about these various groups agreeing with each other.
having a list of compromised nodes is one thing but having access to the
compromised pipes out from them is another. already it is possible there
is NSA spybots sniffing several, if not many, tor nodes. it still
doesn't give them the entry node or the source --> destination unless
they own a massive amount of the nodes.

you expressed exactly what my first thought was in response - that the
client was merely persistently attempting to use an old directory cache.

you send the message to majordomo, not the list address, the info is on the
page that talks about the joining of the mailing list
in a nutshell (iirc) it's a message to majordomo at freehaven.net with no
subject and only one line saying 'unsubscribe or-talk' and nothing else
apart from a signature with a '--' on the line above it (the normal way of
marking the signature section of an email.
sorry for this redundant message everyone else
