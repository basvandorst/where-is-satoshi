Indeed. "Human rights" mean different things to different people. But it is perhaps worth pointing out that the very EXISTENCE of TOR as a public project is a political act. There is no way to keep politics out of the TOR project, since the very idea that anyone who can connect to the web should be able to communicate anonymously is a highly contentious idea. (And if you don't believe that this should be the case, what rationale do you have to support TOR in its present form?)
There is a great deal of sense in not publicly aligning TOR with any one political group or movement. Moreover, what movement could TOR be aligned with? There are both proponents and opponents of anonymity of every political stripe. It is, after all, a decidedly mixed bag...
But let's not kid ourselves that TOR can ever be "politically neutral," even if it cannot be comfortably shoe-horned into any political Oh, and hello to OR-Talk from a former lurker. :-)
