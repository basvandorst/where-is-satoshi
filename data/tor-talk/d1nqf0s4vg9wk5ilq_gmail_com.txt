@_subject: seeking advice on configuring Tor/Vidalia to run as relay on ubuntu 7.10 [gutsy] 
I have recently migrated from windows to linux ubuntu 7.10 [gutsy] &
I'm in the process of configuring Tor as relay server. I have found
these instructions:
Could anyone advise if these instructions look like they will work? I
will probably use the latest tor-rc. Also, can anyone point me in the
direction of some reliable instructions for upgrading to new versions
of Tor/Vidalia after Tor/Vidalia has already been installed & is
running as server on ubuntu 7.10.
I read recently on or-talk of some problems regarding running
Tor/Vidalia on ubuntu but have been unable to find the or-talk thread
for this! Is this problem now resolved? Could someone post a link to
this thread or give me some advice to overcome the previously
documented problems? I am fairly new to linux & in this respect clear,
easy to follow instructions would be appreciated.
Many Thanks,
john smith

ubuntu repositories because they
are slow to update their version.
this was one of my concerns so i worked from the shell to get a more
up to date version, infact the whole install/config i did from the
shell (which i think i will use the most from now on)
I'm realising the same thing myself now (although i like the gui on
vidalia for entertainment value)!
my only concern is that i used the libevent version (1.3b) from the
ubuntu repositories which is a little outdated now (i hope this will
not create any problems) so will upgrade that next time i upgrade the
tor version.
apart from that i was happy with the install! along with learning
linux in more depth i would like to make GnuPG my next project.

@_subject: another unusual connection 
Since my last post I have observed that, in the Tor Network Map
component of Vidalia, the list of relays is no longer being updated.
Currently, the list of relays announces that 400 relays are online
(685 total).
On another box running Tor as client, I see my relay listed & a much
larger number of relays are announced as being available.
Also, the Tor circuits are no longer being listed in the connections &
status pane of the Network Map. Refreshing the list of relays does not
change anything but establishing a connection via firefox will prompt
the tor circuit to be listed in the connection & status pane.
This is the first time, since reporting these unusual connections,
that there has been anything like this happen.
I forgot to post with the log yesterday that the connection to the
*new* IP address persisted for around 10 minutes (the duration of a
If this is a bug, why are so few other people reporting it? This seems
odd to me! More recently I acquired a static IP address from my ISP to
replace my dynamic IP address but I can see no reason why this would
result in the type of unsual connections that I have reported.
Other comments posted on this subject have begun to make me wonder if
these unusual connections may be attributable more specifically to
some aspect of my connection. Could this be the case? There have been
no other changes to my connection apart from what I had mentioned in
previous posts (updated firmware on my router).
Any ideas?

I'm guessing you didn't set your Address line
Can you give me a few more hints? Anything else in the logs?
i rarely use the box that runs my tor relay for any other purposes
beyond running the tor relay & when i noticed the details in the log i
had not previously been making any other connections to the internet.
no other applications running on the box beyond the vidalia bundle &
nothing else in the logs really beyond the information i detailed in
my previous mail.
I have disabled many processes within the operating system that could
be regarded as unnecessary [i could detail which ones if you think
that would be useful] however my relay has run for quite a few months
now with these services disabled without anything like this happening.
there is one change that i had made in Administrative Tools>Services
just before starting tor 0.1.2.19 - this was to enable the DNS Client
service which was previously disabled (i had not realised that this
service was disabled) & i enabled it because it is generally regarded
as being a service that should be left running (although this did not
seem to affect the running of my node previously). The windows xp
service DNS client is described as:
"Resolves and caches Domain Name System (DNS) names for this computer.
If this service is stopped, this computer will not be able to resolve
DNS names and locate Active Directory domain controllers. If this
service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on it will
fail to start."
so, enabling this DNS service was the only change that i made before
running 0.1.2.19 as relay server.
other (maybe useful) info:
the reason i have taken this long to reply to you is because my
internet connection died last night. this problem first occured 2
nights ago & there were some issues with the router these past few
days that my isp attributed to firmware. now i have updated the
firmware & the connection is working again. when speaking with my isp
[BeUnlimited] they explained they had attenuated my connection's
signal to noise ratio to try to achieve maximum through-put/capacity
with a service they call fast path, apparently fast path can lead to
varying degrees of instability [disconnections, intermittent
hard-to-diagnose problems] & my connection was using fast path when
the unusual connection occurred. last night i asked my isp to stop
this service for the time being until i can be sure this isn't
creating problems for me.
during the process of resolving issues with the router my isp offered
me some new DNS addresses for both the preferred & alternate DNS
connections & my connection was using these new addresses when the
'unusual' connection occurred although i was told there were no
reported problems with these DNS addresses.
i don't know if any of the information i provide here will prove
useful/informative - i just try to provide you with as much
information as i can about how my network/connection was running when
the log messages appeared.
Is this repeatable?
as you can see it has been a busy 48hrs in the life of my network/net
connection! maybe some of these changes/problems [firmware/fast path]
were a contributing factor in creating this unusual connection - i'm
not sure.
Do you run a hidden service too?
Had your relay been running for a long time or short time before this happened?
my relay had been running nearly 20 hours & some 1.5GB of traffic generated.
well, i try to be as detailed here as i can - i hope to have my relay
running again soon & will keep you posted on any re-occurance of this
issue & of course if you have other questions i will try to answer!

Tor Ops are encouraged to mirror the relay directory if they have
sufficient bandwidth.
Can anyone advise if there is some kind of minimum amount of bandwidth
that can be used to mirror the relay directory?
I am assuming that I would forward the relay directory mirror port in
the same way that I have forwarded my relay port.

@_subject: Possible bug in vidalia 0.1.5 'Tor Network Map' GUI? 
3 days ago I upgraded my tor relay (running on gutsy 7.10) to
tor-0.2.0.28-rc (compiled from source) with vidalia 0.1.5 (compiled
from source).
I have noticed during the last 24 hours that, from time to time, the
Tor Network Map in vidalia is not listing a complete circuit.
What I mean by this is, whilst all 3 nodes in the current tor circuit
are clearly listed in the 'Connection Status' pane of the 'Tor Network
Map' GUI, the more detailed list of the nodes, that resides to the
right hand side of the 'Connection Status' pane, lists only the entry
& middle nodes.
I have managed to observe this about 6 or 7 times in the last 24 hours
(this error only occurs sporadically).
When I've noticed this behavior & verified the IP address of the exit
node in the current circuit, it does indeed correspond with the tor
exit node in the current tor circuit (listed in the 'Connection
Status' pane).
It's just that the same exit node isn't included in the more detailed
list/overview of nodes in the current tor circuit that is displayed to
the right-hand side of the 'Connection Status' pane.
I have only noticed this since upgrading to tor-0.2.0.28-rc & did not
notice this happening when I was using vidalia 0.1.5 (compiled from
source] on the previous 0.2.0.26-rc version of Tor.
Is it possible that some error might have occurred when I was
compiling from source or could this possibly be some other kind of
Everything else in tor-0.2.0.28-rc & vidalia 0.1.5 seems to be working
perfectly ok.
Any ideas anyone?

Greetings from SE Asia,
I've been unable to download bridges in the 1.3.3 version of the
tor-browser bundle for windows, when attempting to download bridges
via Settings>Network>Find Bridges Now.
Each time I attempt to download bridges I receive the following:
"Unable to download bridges: HTTP request failed".
I've attempted to acquire bridges, using the above described method,
on several occasions during the last week - each time receiving the
same notification.
Is it possible this connection is being blocked from within the
country where I'm attempting to retrieve the bridges (Thailand) or
perhaps from somewhere else?
I also noticed the same problem with the previous version of the tor
browser bundle for windows, so it would not seem to necessarily be a
*new* problem.
Of course I've been able to obtain & successfully use bridges using
the other [documented] means of acquiring bridges but I'm left
wondering why this connection problem is happening and if anyone else
was having similar problems either in Thailand or elsewhere?
Any thoughts?
