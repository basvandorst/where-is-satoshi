@_subject: [tor-talk] relay on openvz vserver 
Hi all,
I'm currently running a relay on a vserver. The ISP uses
OpenVZ/Virtuozzo for operating system-level virtualization.
As you can imagine there are problems with the TCP-limiting parameters.
The hard-limits of numtcpsock and tcprcvbuf are set to 550 and 7392000
I set Relay Bandwith/Burst to 490/980 and it works well for most of the
day, however, on peak hours I hit the hard-limits.
What can I do to get the most out of that stupid machine?
