@_subject: [tor-talk] Can't use TORBirdy to send Email 
Hi All,
Just installed TORBirdy on ThunderBird on FireFox 15.0 and added Yahoo
Email account ,but can't send any email, though receive is OK.when TORBirdy
is disabled everything is fine.
Also another TOR instant is already running(TOR Browser Bundle) to make
TorBirdy work. Is that mandatory?
Any trick or suggestion or somewhere do i make mistake?

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy 0.0.9 released - testing and feedback 
First of all thanks all for developing TorBirdy,
I just DLed and installed Mozilla Thunderbird then TorBirdy,
I have a problem , i can send email via a Gmail account, but via Yahoo
account I get error, it seems that can not connect to Yahoo smtp server,
the default chosen yahoo smtp server is smtp.mail.yahoo.com, should i
change smtp server to something else? or another trick?
both tested when TorBirdy was disabled and enabled, result was the same.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy with TOR? 
Sorry, may be a newbie question,
But while using ThunderBird with TorBirdy, must another instance of TOR be
running?, for example BBT or Vidalia?
Just dled TorBirdy 0.0.10.xpi but i should run BBT before to make TorBirdy
work.does TorBirdy not work lonely?

Thanks a lot, Yeah document regarding this issue and also encrypting and
signing the message by ThunderMail is necessary .

@_subject: [tor-talk] Encryption on Http 
May be a silly question, but why TOR does not use http traffic encrypted
with shared key instead of using SSL ( like Your-Freedom project)?
so encrypted http traffic would be routed through TOR network , this would
be useful in countries where using SSL or HTTPS is forbidden.

Hi all,
GTalk and Yahoo Messenger both port configured using 9050 .the BBT logs
show the following message:
[Sun Sep 23 21:19:41 2012] Unknown SOCKS Protocol - One of your
applications tried to establish a connection through Tor using a protocol
that Tor does not understand. Please ensure you configure your applications
to use only SOCKS4a or SOCKS5 with remote hostname resolution.
There's nowhere for both to configure any sort of SOCKS.
Any trick or suggestion?
Thanks in advance,

Hi all,
My GMail account configured on Thunderbird,whether TORBirdy is enabled or
not I can't send any message but receiving is ok, SMTP error screen
appears, even ask me to enter my account password.
Maybe not suitable location to ask here , but is there any trick or I
missed something in configuration?
Thanks in advance,

HI again,
Problem solved, authentication method for SMTP must be set to Normal.
Thanks anyway,

Please let us know the exact error message and the TorBirdy version you
are using.
Maybe not suitable location to ask here , but is there any trick or I
missed something in configuration?
Not likely, but it depends on the error so let's check that first.
