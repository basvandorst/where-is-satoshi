Drama. Clearly exposing your own browsing on your own file system on your own computer is a conspiracy of epic proportions. If the existence of vidalia debug log is a risk to your anonymity, you are already owned.
Did you know tor, vidalia, and firefox talk over localhost? Google localhost and you will find a HUGE conspiracy affecting BILLIONS of computers. Billions of people are exposed to the localhost peer to peer network and infestation.

sorry boys, merely sarcasm at ming's comments. localhost is bit of sarcasm to counter the log file issues.  will return to lurking.
