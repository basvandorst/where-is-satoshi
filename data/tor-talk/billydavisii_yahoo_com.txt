Well, count me in as your first "trendy" subscriber... I'd don't have a clue about writing code and I'm really too damned boring to need privacy, but I'm trying to figure out how to participate as a server just to be part of the "movement"...
I can see where requiring bandwidth for bandwidth usage would fail...
But I just didn't want to create something that was this rediculusly
easy to use w/out some more redundancy on the network. Don't get me
wrong, tor is still easy to use, but this is over the top above and
beyond easy. people who didn't really need anonymity would still use
it. it might even become... "trendy" (gasp)
