@_subject: Is it possible to use Tor on such devices? 
I have the n800 and I did not try tor on it, but I'm sure that it'll
work if you try this "package":
I have it installed and I do use almost everything :)

@_subject: varying bandwith without stopping tor 
I have a node inside
( fastweb network
(a provider of fibre connectivity/telephony) and I noticed that when
I use my phone I experience low quality (metallic) voice transmission.
I assume it's tor bandwith consumption (albeit limited to 100k) and
I'd like to switch tor server bandwith programmatively, by creating
a small daemon that senses voip traffic and lowers tor bandwith
allocation just for the duration of the phone call, without stopping it.
Do you think it's possible? Can I access the control port to drive
tor through a command?
This page ( mentions a
script that does that, but I did not find any link... :(
Thank you

@_subject: "cease and desist" from my vps provider... 
just to let you know, I had a tor node up and running for about two
years ( today my
vps provider sent me a "cease and desist" email to tear down my
node, I complied of course but I asked why.
They told me it's against italian law to have a tor relay, anyone
has more info?
Anyway I was about to switch to another provider, can someone
suggest me one that allows tor nodes?
Thank you

@_subject: "cease and desist" from my vps provider... 
asked, they told me to contact a lawyer (sic!)
I told them that if they are telling me that they cannot keep my
service up for some legal reason they should provide (I just asked
for a weblink) the specific reason/law, no answer from them until
now (and I don't think I'll ever get one)
self suggestion: I asked hetzner if they accept a tor node, they
told me "yes, but you're responsible" (of course)
that will be my next step ;)
italian tor (would-be) admins beware: avoid SEFLOW.it!
