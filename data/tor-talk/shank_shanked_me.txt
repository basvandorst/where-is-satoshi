As I'm sure many others have pointed out, this is a mailing list for tor
discussion, not Lizard Squad. You might want to email them at lizards at
riseup.net rather than posting here.

Lizard squad: he's referring to the fact that the network doesn't have
consensus on the BadExit flag existing; the BadExit flag is not what
happened to your network either. The BadExit flag is given if an exit node
is misbehaving or breaking the traffic somehow. The LizardNSA* group was
added to the ignore list for voting and consensus purposes; the directory
authorities no longer vote on the blacklisted nodes.

The fact of the matter is, you tweeted that you were attempting a zero day
exploit with Tor, and you used a large number of nodes to (accomplish?)
that. Whether or not you were or were not attempting a Sybil attack, that's
the only thing that people can see as the "attack" that was mentioned.
I mean, if you wanted to you could maybe publically post saying that you
were creating free exits, instead of saying that Tor users are
Tor's network is all about consensus; adding new relays is super detectable
and easy to mitigate. The system is decentralized. If someone (e.g. a
government) wanted it gone, it would have been removed a long time ago.
You manning the email account appear to at least be mildly interested in
supporting Tor, but it seems like the Twitter account person is working
opposite in force. That's all it looks like to me.
