Ignore how the socialist-fascist-MIC despises the NRA, OK? I doubt that such criticism would be leveled at the "approved" liberal
causes that adopt the identical practices or even the more unethical
ones for far more draconian purposes than the NRA's defence of the law.
You want something done politically? don't turn up your nose at what
works. do what your enemy does and do it better. Or stay home and
complain and do nothing and stay out of the way.

Then this can be got around by either downloading all the fonts,
whether used or not or by not downloading any fonts and using existing
fonts or substiutions, by default.
This obviously works best when *everyone* does one or the other.
How can this be done in the browser? I'd like to see a config option in
firefox if there isn't one already. (Yes! Let's heap even MORE
COMPLEXITY upon complexity!!!)

Suspect your window manager  and/or video driver. Historically,
it's always been one or both of those two. Try a different window
manager for a while.
