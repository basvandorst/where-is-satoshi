You could also use the transport option in /etc/tor/torrc
This enables routing of your tcp-based traffic through the transparent proxy function provided by tor.
Take a look at the tor wiki.
I also posted a small howto I use by myself prosperously.

Why don't you get yourself a v-root kvm server with a debian image for ?5 a month, a FQDN for ?30 per anno and setup your own mail server if you can not setup one at home?
Exim or postfix are not so hard to learn and roundcube is pretty easy to install :)

I have to disagree with you on behalf of SPAM.
I opened Port 25 on one of my exits. In a week I got blacklisted by Google and some DNSBL's for sending spam.
It took me quite a time to erase my IP from these lists...
I can live with port 587 for submission, but I will never open port 25 again.

My router has also dnsmasq running, but this is not crashing. Although the requests are quite high.
I have an iptables rule for the directory port of tor and the rest of my ports. The directory port is hit dramatically since 2 1/2 weeks.
The other ports, 20,21,22,25,80 and so on, are bruteforced in the common way as it is known on the i-net :)

I'm using ChatSecure 13.1.13-beta2 and Orbot 13.06-RC2 from the guardianproject repo.
Before heartbleed every thing was working like a charm.
Since the last update, regarding the occurence of the heartbleed bug, from Orbot I can not use ChatSecure with Orbot.
If i use ChatSecure either trough Orbot or trough a transparent proxy using TOR, or a VPN service ChatSecure is not connecting to the XMPP server.
Using the regular 3G mode is the only way to connect to the XMPP server.
Is this due to the bumpy network, or are there other issues to be aware of?

On that note.
 root certificates are missing mostly.
You have to install them by your own. Personally i prefer cacert.org, because firstly you have to identify yourself and secondly you actually are meeting assurers face to face with your passport in hand which will grant you points from 5 to 20. At 50 points you get a server certificate for 2 years.
That's as close as you can get to a so called CA!

I am using Exim on a hidden service.
Principally make your SMTP listen on local host and on the used onion TLD, and edit the hidden service line, so it will redirect incoming traffic on port 25 and/or 587 to localhost: 25 and/or localhost:587.
Be sure to build a certificate corresponding to your onion TLD, else users might get confused.
I personally didn't get spamassasin to work with a SMTP on localhost, but that's another story :)

I am sorry for you, many others, current and raising TOR users for reading the history of the i-net and TOR.
I think every majure and grown one on this planet using software more than installing it by clicking yes, and yes and yes is reading the miscansellous part before installing anything.
If you have used TOR without the knowledge of certain circumstances, i gently may advise you to do some reading, before you state me or others to not have told you of some horrific scenarios.
I did not say that i know everything, but i am using TOR in an advanced matter and i make my mistakes daily, trying to learn as much as i can.
I personally think you should do the same.
2.) Regarding mass surveilance:
Our global spy affair is nothing new, especially the digital one, Snowden just brought it up on the mass media. Every admin of a backbonerouter knew that probably before Snowden was hired by the NSA.
Also the affair of memorizing every phone call is nothing new to professionals, this was also raised by snowden in the mass media.
Do some reading about google, and please do not use google to find some awnsers, and then ask yourself why google is offering blazing fast services and a mobile OS for free?
3.) Conclusion:
The way of using depends on you, not on the provider. Please don't walk arround and stamp with your foot on the floor, just because you did not know.
We always have to choose between the less severe consequences, not the best I don't blame TOR for beeing funded by NSA, CIA, NAVY and what so ever. The fact that govs are using it, even EU sited ones, makes me think that it can't be that bad for me to be a sidekick.

On Monday, Edward Snowden spoke to a crowd of thousands at SXSW, and it seriously felt like he was reading our minds.
?The NSA is setting fire to the future of the internet,? Snowden said, ?and you guys are the firefighters.? He went on to issue a call to arms for the tech community, saying that ?encryption works? as proven by the fact that the U.S. government still has no idea what documents he has provided to journalists We?ve been waiting for the right moment to tell you, and we can?t wait any longer. We have a plan to stamp out the NSA?s fire once and for all: on June 5th, 2014 -- the anniversary of the first Snowden NSA story -- we will Reset the Net, and take our privacy back.
This week we learned in a shocking NY Times story that the FISA court had secretly approved widespread sharing of raw private data across the government (2). It?s a long article, and you should read it, but here?s the TL;DR: thanks to so-called ?Fusion Centers? and secret laws, the local cops in your town have at their fingertips everything about you that the NSA has collected over the past 5 years. Without a warrant.
It gets worse. Yesterday morning we learned that the NSA is using automation to hack and gain control of  ?millions? of computers (3).
Governments have abused the Internet and twisted into something it was never intended to be. They?ve stolen our most private moments, and with them our most basic freedoms to communicate and be ourselves. Everyone has been waiting for some resounding action that meets the problem of government spying head on. This is our moment to rally and realize our power. We don?t need anyone?s permission, but we need everyone?s participation. If you?re a developer, designer, or cryptographer and want to help, please reply to this email and get in touch.

Since i updated my system, your server doesn't have the proper cipher suites to negotiate a TLS handshake.

Maybe, if i may pop in, it's just all about an user exploit and the money ( bitcoin ) travel.
Remember, 85% of user systems are MS based, and we all do know that this system was not built with privacy for the user mind.
If I can watch what my "zombie bot net" is doing, it is not so hard to figure this out.
In my limited knowledge, it would not be too hard to inject an application of the HS over an exploited user system.
Besides, I didn't read about TOR vulnerabilitis, I just read about global cooperation and technology which does not imply a zero day exploit against TOR HS protocol.
And yes, drug users are written on LE black boards.

I personally do not know why you are using privoxy on a machine with a webserver running.
I believe privoxy to be your stumbling stone...
I would disable it for testing.
I took a look at a hiddenservie with a webserver running, and my terminal output looks a bit like this.
1.) Testing what is LISTENING

Take a look at the TorTracWiki or here [1] if you want to read more about it.

i don't think letsencrypt will work on a HS because letsencrypt checks [1] if the domain you type in, is registered.
So for example on a clearnet IP which has a registered domain at mydomain.com called myserver.tld, letsencrypt makes a DNS check for this clearnet IP and gets the awnser, that this clearnet IP has a registeres domain called myserver.tld on mydomain.com.
How should letsencrypt do this on a HS?

so far running good and nice to handle, obviously to the neighborhood to FireFox.
The quit Function would be nice to have, on FireFox it's working also and you have the possibility to kill cookies, cache etc with this function.

A NAS works at home very well, but if you need access from abroad you would need to connect it to your router with a domain.
Personally I prefer the mentioned solution, but to blame TOR for the lock out forced by ransomware on your desktop leads me to the question, what OS is used on the desktop. A guess toward Redmond seems to be, let's say, the native problem.
That does not imply that TOR is primaly guilty, it is just used by ransomware to hide the actor.
Again, use clouds under your control and use an OS with FOSS, that seems to be the best solution of the worst options.
