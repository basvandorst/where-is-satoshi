@_subject: [tor-talk] Is Ubuntu JAUNTY of tor version end of life? 
Hi all,
Sorry for my bad english.
I've just received announce "[tor-announce] Tor 0.2.1.30 is released".
When I making update, I've error message :
  404 Not Found [IP: 78.46.17.118 80]
I'm looking in  and jaunty directory missing.
All was right in last update Tor 0.2.1.29.
Is it because jaunty version of tor is end of life? Is there any announces about that?
Because update from jaunty to lucid is big work for I, it seems useful to knew end of life before ;)
Thanks for your help about this.

Well done! I've migrated to UBUNTU 10.04 LTS (Lucid lynx) and tor server run well again.
But, any information about end of life of Jaunty version of tor?
And what about end of life of Lucid Lynx version in few month/years?

Yes, it's the same for Jaunty.
Look at  [DIR]	hardy/	26-Feb-2011 13:27 	 -
[DIR]	karmic/	26-Feb-2011 13:27 	-
[DIR]	lenny/	26-Feb-2011 13:27 	-
[DIR]	lucid/	26-Feb-2011 13:27 	-
[DIR]	maverick/ 26-Feb-2011 13:27 	-
It seems only these versions are now supported by Tor project under Ubuntu, but I don't know why.
