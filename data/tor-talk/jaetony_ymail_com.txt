@_subject: [tor-talk] tor connection error 
Well I'm running Tor v0.2.2.37(vidalia bundle) I've upgraded from the previous version.? After the upgrade I started receiving an error.
"vidalia was unable to register for some events.? Many of Vidalia's features my be unavailable.
Control socket is not connected."
Now if I run vidalia at the end of installation I don't receive any errors, but once I close everything out and try I get that error.

 02 08:26:32.063 [Error] We couldn't read a descriptor that is supposedly mmaped in our cache.? Is another process running in our data directory?? Exiting.
I found that although I'm logged in with an administrator account if I right click and "run as administrator" seems to fix this issue.? This wasn't an issue in any previous versions that I've used.
