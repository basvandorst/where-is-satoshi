@_subject: [tor-talk] newbie: tor browser bundle and privoxy 
Hello, list. I am newbie in Tor. By reading an information about tor i found article(         ), that says:
"The biggest problem with many applications is that they /leak DNS requests/. That is, although they use Tor to anonymize the traffic, they first send a DNS request /untorified/ in order to get the IP address of the target system. /Then/ they communicate "anonymously" with that target. The problem: any eavesdropper with more than three brain cells can conclude what website you visited, if they see that you send a DNS request for rsf.org , followed by some "anonymous" Tor traffic. The solution: *use Tor together with Privoxy*, that prevents DNS leaks."
Next, on  i found, that *Tor Browser Bundle* consist of:
    * Vidalia 0.2.15
    * Tor 0.2.2.35 (with libevent-2.0.16-stable, zlib-1.2.5, openssl-1.0.0e)
    * Mozilla Aurora 9.0.1 and Torbutton 1.4.5.1)
    * Pidgin 2.7.5 and OTR 3.2 (only in Tor IM Browser Bundle)
So, Tor Browser Bundle does not contain Privoxy.
Now question: does this mean, that Tor Browser Bundle is less secure than separately installed Tor + Privoxy?
P.S. sorry for my rough english.
