@_subject: [tor-talk] What about new Vidalia GUI features ? 
What do you think about new vidalia GUI features like:
(text between two () means the text for the user [while text between two [] means the message for the developer] )
1. Refine Exit properties [by GUI modify the strictExitNodes in torrc]
+ by Country,
  + Country Flags,
   + FR
   + GB
+ by pool,
  +pool ranges,
   + 0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255
  +strict IP-s
   + x.y.z.w, z.w.x.y
+ by Nick,
  + tor nikkx
   +
   +
2. Advanced Techniqs against packet size and packet count correlation (tm) (experimental):
+ append dummy data for every packet (against packet size correlation) :
  + dummy data range:
   - 16 - 1536 bytes [fixed minimum and maximum limit for keep TOR as fast as possible] (keep the value as tight as possible between these two values to keep the path as secure as possible ')
   - 10 - 250 % of main packet size [refineable by potmeter]
+ append dummy packets for delaying (against packet count correlation) :
  + dummy packet delaying range:
   + 1500 - x millisec [fixed minimum delaying for keep TOR as fast as + minimim cast of the path (or: keep path through 4 [or more] ]relays ) (against many of "rule over the TOR relays" attacks)
  +number of relays:
   - 4
   - 5
   - 6 (for paranoids)
(The more relays the secure whilest the slower)
3. Torlic Settings (tm) (experimental) (for Extra paranoids):
+ number of subchannels:
  - 2
  - 3
+ number of EXITs:
  - 1
   - 2
   - 3
    + rotate EXIT data:
     -true,
      -false
       + advanced multiple EXIT properties:
        + fixed EXITs by IP
         + IP tables
        + fixed EXITs by domains and/or masks:
         + domain list and masks...
