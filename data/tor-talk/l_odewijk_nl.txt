@_subject: [tor-talk] HTML5 video and Tor anonymity. 
2013/5/1 Andrew F Flash video is a generalized thing. Playback a stream. So you could write a
local-only flash parser to find out what the stream's source is, then play
it back in your own player. I believe there were several open source flash
players that didn't do much more than play video.
Regardless you're fighting for dinosaurs. The word is out, flash isn't
required and it's really unsafe.

@_subject: [tor-talk] HTML5 video and Tor anonymity. 
2013/5/17 Griffin Boyce I don't want to extend a discussion about Flash too much. But with WebGL
HTML5 is up and beyond Flash in terms of potential for games.
There will always remain Flash dependent webpages. And I'm talking about
those build-completely-in-flash websites. I've even experienced a ton of
Korean websites that require you to install COM objects, activate ActiveX
in IE, require you to install some file from a .exe, or all of the above.
Just forget about it, it's not worth the effort. Users should complain and
reject too non-standard webpages so much that they'll stop being developed,
that's the only way to really fix this.
The easiest way now would be sandboxing and manually approving every
network request. The other ways are experimental, circumstantial and
exceedingly hard to program.

On Jan 20, 2014 2:55 AM, "TheMindwareGroup" Please elaborate. This is a freedom of speech issue. Europe ensures this
sort of freedom or speech.
Britain too is subject to European law.
Taking babies left and right is a disturbance of family, see art. 8

And finding information which for some reason is blocked in KR. I've had
some very normal websites block out because they trip the automatic
blocking for no apparent reason! Perhaps a word that's forbidden in some
language's slang appears by accident in my language's pages.
And just trying not to be dragnetted at all times. It's important to
sometimes use Tor, just so that when you actually do (one day, for whatever
reason!) it doesn't seem suspicious :)

So... nobody thinks using Tor might actually just make you stand out? I
mean, Tor might be quite broken and in that case you're just forwarding the
relevant stuff to the agencies.

nothing interesting discussed. A voting system to ban content on a free
speech platform? Wonder how he got the words out of his mouth.
I also like "Anonymity allows for illegal, immoral things like
buying/selling people" - it started off pretty half assed, as anonymity
doesn't mean freedom, and finished a bit strange knowing human trafficking
is legally practiced (soccer players get bought/sold) and morality is fluid.
Jep, worthless

@_subject: [tor-talk] CloudFlare fingerprinting 
Of course it's possible. It's way harder than just, you know, regular
tracking! Cloudflare probably has advanced tracking in order to determine
the likelihood of being spam. Cloudflare also gets headers and IP
addresses, in addition to having many access points already betray the user
a little bit. The NSA only has to make sure to listen to every Cloudflare
in and output, and they'll get a ton of decent info.
A similar argument goes for Google's Recaptcha. I really like the UI for
the new "captcha-free-captcha", but I also know that profiling is the main
ingredient for it to work. I also dislike always being given a captcha
anyway, just because I run debian and have minimal anti-tracking. Welcome
to a world where privacy reduces features!

2015-03-01 16:11 GMT+09:00 Lodewijk andr? de la porte :
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't notice you meant this as tor-specific. That sure
makes it a more difficult question.  I think there is little information to
go on, given many users use a single Tor exit node, and if all goes well
that information should be inseparable. NoScript makes it much harder to
see what happens on-page, without noscript there's a lot more profiling
info (mouse movement, typing rates, scrolling, those sorts of habits). One
could investigate if cloudflare can use a tracking-cookie (or similar) to
combine visits from a single user, as that would give a lot more profiling
opportunities. I assume every request passes through cloudflare, not just
the first, so site-usage should give a much better profile than the initial
Once you've found all the side-channels and their "discerning datapoint
quantity" you could calculate how often the users of a single tor node are
separable. The data is more complex, sadly, for a full observer, as there's
far more information to go on. A partial or near-full network observer can
combine timing attacks and the like with information gathered here.
