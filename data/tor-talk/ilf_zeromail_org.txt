@_subject: [tor-talk] torbrowser: resume session 
I asked this over RT, but was told to re-ask here:
In Tor Browser Preferences -> "When Tor Browser starts", the option "Show my windows and tabs from last time" is unselectable.
about:config "browser.startup.page = 3" has no effect: Is there any way to override this and resume session on startup?
Thanks, and keep up the good work!
