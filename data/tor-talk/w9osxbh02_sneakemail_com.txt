For those of you trying to download Anonym.OS from the Wired article, there's also the Bittorrent, which seems to work pretty quickly.

Cool. What BT client would you recommend for Linux? The standard one sucks (or else I do) and I've never been able to DL anything with it. Maybe I just don't know WTF I'm doing, who knows...

Not sure as I've never used ktracker. I use asureus (spelled it wrong the first time) - which is java based and very easy to install under your user account and doesn't require root rights. All I do is find a torrent search site, search for what I'm looking for,  download the torrent file, open it in azureus and the rest happens automatically. I also have to adjust my upload speed as my upline pipe is rather limited.
I am pretty new to the bittorrent as well so I don't yet understand all the components.

Don't know what is causing the problem with your seeding error, but do you have a natted port set up in your firewall to allow through for Azureus?
Sometimes it takes a little while for the tracker info to come through.

I get an error mesage saying that linuxtracker.org/announce.php is sending an impropper response. None of the SF mirrors seem to have this file, no do any other BT search engines that I've tried! :(
