@_subject: [tor-talk] geoip6 
Can someone tell me if I have to do something about geoip6 warnings?
I've got a bridge relay running from a vista x64 machine. As with the
past few TBB versions I'm still getting occasional message-log warnings:
"Failed to open GEOIP file C:\Users\,\AppData\Roaming
\AppData\Roaming\tor doesn't exist, nor does the subfolder
\geoip6, as I'm running the bridge from from TBB installed on a USB
stick. The installation seems correct, my geoip is in the data
directory as usual. As far as I can tell the bridge is connecting to
circuits as it should (though it's not carrying as much traffic as
I did find some discussion in bug tracker, but it's months old and
doesn't suggest anything that I can do.
So, do these warnings even apply to my relay installation? Can I
just ignore them?

I'm running Tor v0.2.3.25 in bridge mode on Win 7. I can write
SafeLogging 1 | relay into torrc, but SafeLogging 0 doesn't take (I
write it into torrc, but then when I go look at the running torrc from
vidalia, it's not there), and the Message Log records [scrubbed]. This
didn't happen - I was able to see all the nodes - in previous versions.
I'm curious: is the info for SafeLogging in tor-manual.html.en out of date?
If this is not the sort of question to discuss in the clear forum, I'll
be glad to send it encrypted to Support.
Much obliged, eliaz

You don't need Tor to do this. Load HTTPS Everywhere into our open

Thanks for the post & reply, I too was wondering about the absence of
vidalia in 3.5. I find the BW graph useful in picking quiet times to
unload the bridge without inconveniencing clients. Does that make sense?
Or is it enough to stop tor nicely?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Darknets/science vs. GPA/LEA/Law, 
I can appreciate both views, but I wonder if it helps our understanding
of the problem to glom onto only one of these opposites. On the one hand
participating in Tor gives anonymity/freedom to people (many, I hope)
who use it for communal/good ends. But it also allows a few (I hope)
people to abuse it. Tor's a carrier, it's not its place to censor/judge
traffic. That's a is a function of the cops/courts and of society at
large. If by some horrible chance Tor had an internal monitoring
function, I don't know that I'd opt into judging any HS or user - I'd
probably end up obsessing over each individual case. I'd much rather
spend my time helping to make Tor more anonymous and free, leaving it to
the cops to chase those they think are miscreants. Of course I also have
to fight against the illegitimate use of police/state power. Such is
life. Just MO. - eliaz

@_subject: [tor-talk] obfsproxy and windows 
Though AFAICT my bridge is configured correctly, it appears to carry
very little traffic. This has raised a number of questions regarding the
use of vanilla and obfuscated clients & bridges in windows.
I run a bridge on Win 7, with Tor 0.2.4.24 (git-a8a38e5dd1fbb67a) in its
own folder, with standalone Vidalia running off a USB stick. I have the
same setup for a Tor client on a different machine on the same LAN. I
configure the client as obfsproxy-capable or plain as a way to teach
myself about obfuscated clients. Once the Tor circuits come up, I open
torbirdied thunderbird for e-mail.
The Client: I've been surprised to see that messages under obfsproxy
generally go about as fast as plain ones. Are there enough obfsproxy
servers that my mail isn't slowing things down for people who really
need obfuscation? I guess another way of asking this would be, Is Tor
obfuscation now robust enough so that everyone may as well use it?
If the client is configured to be obfsproxy-capable, can it still avail
itself of vanilla bridges?
The Bridge: I'm currently running it as what I take to be
obfsproxy-aware. That is, after rummaging around the sparse windows
documentation, I've written
"ClientTransportPlugin obfs2,obfs3 exec
Tor\PluggableTransports\obfsproxy managed"
into the torrc. AFAIK this is all one must do to change a vanilla bridge
into an obfsproxy-aware one. Is that correct?
Will the obfsproxy-aware bridge also accept traffic from non-obfuscated
clients? In other words, does  it make sense to write something like
Bridge obfs3 w.x.y.z:80 ...
Bridge a.b.c.d:443 ...
into torrc of obfsproxy-configured clients?
I realize one wouldn't ordinarily want to do this; one either needs
obfuscation or one does not. I ask the question because I'm trying to
understand how obfuscation works. I would've tried setting up such a
client myself, except that I've lost access to the remote-ISP client
that I had used to test such ideas.
These days I'm lucky if "Who has used my bridge?" shows one or two 1-8
entries once every two weeks or so. Looking at Globe/Onionoo and the
relay DBs, I see that though the bridge's advertized BW runs between 20
and 40 kB/s, the actually used mean written/mean read traffic is in the
100s/10s-Byte range. for either my vanilla or obfsproxy-aware
configurations. Does this simply mean that there are enough bridges so
that any particular one isn't called on too often? That is, is the
behavior I'm seeing typical? Or am I doing some thing(s) wrong? I'd be
much obliged for any feedback. - eliaz

@_subject: [tor-talk] documentation for Windows users 
I began using Tor a couple of years ago, not so much because I needed a
secure client as because I wanted to help the network by running a
bridge. At the time I jumped in I was running Windows. I'm still running
Tor on that OS.
It was very easy to set up a bridge. However it was a long struggle to
understand how the bridge was supposed to be working and how I might
track its behavior. Vidalia is no longer integrated into the browser,
and portable transports & different tracking mechanisms have come in.
I think my difficulties arose mostly because (1) the documentation is
oriented toward linux users, and (2) some of the documentation hasn't
yet caught up with the improvements and elaborations. For a while I've
been wanting to review the documentation and propose some changes.
I have a day job, and though the documentation has been nagging at me
I'm not sure when I'll be able to get to it. But the first thing would
be to ascertain whether there are enough Windows client/bridge users to
make the project worthwhile. So I'm here are asking for any of the
following stats:
1. What percentage of Tor users are running it on Windows?
2. What percentage of the Windows users run a client only?
3. What percentage run solely or mostly a bridge or bridges?
(That is, in 2 & 3 I'm trying to get a sense of the overlap of Windows
clients and bridges, which would influence any documentation I might
come up with.)
Thanks for any help and comments - eliaz

Good luck.  the Tor Browser is a very user friendly *client* interface.
But when tor.exe got integrated into the Tor browser, windows users (at
least me) have not been able to set up relays. It seems that Tor
developers have abandoned the windows OS, and so made it impossible for
the community of windows users to contribute bridges, let alone relays.
I'd attempt to volunteer for that work, but I'm not a programmer.

Your assumption is incorrect.  I invested in a dedicated box, which I
ran 24/7.  Unfortunately that CPU (embedded Atom 2550) turned out not to
be able to run *nix.
I don't feel bad.  Just annoyed that that Tor developers abandoned
windows support without letting anyone know that windows users would
henceforth be limited to clients, not relays.  I actually don't need it
for client, but was enthusiastic to contribute to the network by running
a bridge at least.
I agree with that.  But the Tor project should keep us informed on
developments or lack thereof, so we don't waste our time trying to setup
bridges in windows when it's no longer possible. - eliaz

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fwd: Cryptopolitik and the Darknet 
As an erstwhile bridge operator & also one who's put a lot of thought
into the possibilities of abuse of the network, and also never quite
believing that "there are more good than bad people," I found the
article extremely useful.  Two passages from the summary:
"Proponents of hidden services argue that the cryptographic
protocols that power the internet today were at the fringe
of software development and considered a threat as late as
1995. Hidden services, they argue, are what https was 20
years prior: the future of security, not a threat to
security. These arguments are strong, and cannot be
dismissed; the technology may well mature and move into the
mainstream in the future. But the crypto purists, Tor's
developers among them, often fail to acknowledge an even
more fundamental point, one that is deeply rooted in the
recent history of cryptography: enhanced privacy, enhanced
authentication and enhanced user anonymity are not tied to
the service or content provider remaining anonymous and
unregistered. Our first four properties ? security,
authentication, user anonymity and cash (or blockchains) ?
are entirely disconnected from the fifth: unidentified
hidden exchanges. These issues are conceptually, politically and
technically distinct. "
"End-to-end encryption will therefore always be available to
a determined, capable user. Moreover, at present, the
powerful dynamics of open markets for communication
services do not favour end-to-end encryption among
individuals at a large scale, thus limiting the
technology's wider appeal and uptake. Any attempt to
systematically undermine end-to-end encryption ? through
legislation requiring service providers to retain the
option of removing encryption for any given user ? will
likely strengthen more secure implementations by creating
more demand for them, and thus help criminals and
militants. We believe it should be a political no-go area
for democratically elected governments to pursue such a
So if it's possible to retain the desirable aspects of onion services
while also abandoning unidentifiability of content providers, why not do
it?  Tor operators and users could then join the rest a progressive
society, no?
I hope everyone takes time to read the article.  Then it would be
interesting to take a poll or vote here to see how the Tor community
feels about this. - eliaz

Elaboration: I said in my previous post that I never quite believed that
"there are more good than bad people."  I think it's more to the point
of upgrading tor architecture to say that I don't feel comfortable
relying on "there are more good than bad people" as a justification for
the Tor Project's laudable aims. Regardless of numbers there *are*
people who will misuse tor, and the article gives good evidence that
those people are the ones who employ anonymous content platforms. - eliaz

I still don't get it. If one believes in something, why not publish it
non-anonymously? Most of the examples given for anonymous publication
speak of small percentages of crazies. The Cryptopolitik article doesn't
show a small percentage of illicit hidden services. Of the 2,723 hidden
cervices that unambiguously met the taxa used, ~57% were illicit.
Analogies to crazies on the roads, etc., take on a different complexion
with such numbers. Gun violence in this country is pretty bad, but 57%?
It's easy to be a libertarian or anarchist at home. These perspectives
have contributed a lot to society; at the same time there's good reason
why they don't work as sole governing principles. For even
self-governance to work, liberty has to entertain constraints. The
Cryptopolitik study & article attempts to set the groundwork for a
non-bureaucratic, non-centralized but purely architectural way this
might be done.
That some people might have a non-criminal reason to host anonymous
sites is a valid concern. But, if "anonymous publication" isn't an
oxymoron, those folks will surely find ways to do it.
Maybe tor-talk isn't the place to talk about these issues. Thanks for
the opposite viewpoints. I'll shut up now, but will be interested to
follow any dialogue that ensues by folks who have waded thru the whole
article. - eliaz
