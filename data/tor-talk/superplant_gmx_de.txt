@_subject: [tor-talk] Mail through Tor 
are there any issues in controlling email-boxes through the provider-
webfrontends (gmail, gmx, etc.) using tor?
I read for example about referers in between entering account information and being redirected to mail-provider-http-sites for a short moment so that session hijacking by the exit node operator is possible (intercepting auth-
cookies etc.).
Any behavior suggestions here? I didn't find much on the web.
