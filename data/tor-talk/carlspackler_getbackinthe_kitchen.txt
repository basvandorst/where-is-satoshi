@_subject: [tor-talk] Better bridge management for clients 
When using bridges on a daily basis, how may I know which
work and which don't? (Say for example you added multiple
bridge lines and not simply one bridge)
It would be nice to add to the GUI some color coded buttons,
like "green" for "working bridge" and "red" for "bridge
is no longer usable" and the user is either given the option
to tick a box and remove the non functioning bridges with the
red color beside them or have them pruned automatically before
all is said and done. An option to save (overwrite) the user's saved
list of bridges with only working bridges would be nice.
In addition to this being a healthy way of managing bridges
for clients, it would prevent users from hammering away
at IPs where bridges are down, IPs may be dynamic, and some
poor fool obtaining an IP formerly used as a Tor Bridge and
wondering why he's seeing all of this incoming traffic!
Now there may be some internal way of Tor checking this
but it does no good to the Tor client user if he is reusing
the same set of bridges every day, with no apparent feedback
to which are good and which are no longer up.
