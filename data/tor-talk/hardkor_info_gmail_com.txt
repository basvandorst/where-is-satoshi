@_subject: [tor-talk] Ask for RSA key size upgrade 
I saw every RSA keys used in the onion network are 1024 bits long.
As it's advised by the NIST and explained in the attachment of this email,
it should not be called "secure".
I think the dev team of the Tor project should upgrade all default key
sizes to 2048 bits (or 4096 bits if it's not a problem).
What do you think about that ?

Thank you,
I read the documents. Actualy I'm a hidden service operator. And I worry
about the security of my public key.
I generated a 4096 bits key manually and started a hidden service with it.
Tor gnerated a hostname file but I desn't work ...
The only way I found to create a really secure communication channel is to
use HTTPS (with strong encryption) over Tor hidden services. And it make me
sad ...
When will the crypto improvements[1] be released ?

You could start spreading tools like Tails that allow people to communicate
safely in a hostile environment.
Tails can auto-replicate himself.
Is it possible to connect to Tor from Ethiopia ? Is there any blocking
strategy ?

@_subject: [tor-talk] [tails] Crypto enforcement proposal 
I took a look on the persistant partition of tails :
# cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sdb2
Cipher name:       aes
Cipher mode:       cbc-essiv:sha256
Hash spec:         sha1
MK bits:           256
Even if it look secure, I think you could better do this :
Cipher name:       serpent
Cipher mode:       xts-essiv:sha256
Hash spec:         sha512
MK bits:           512
What do you think about that ?

@_subject: [tor-talk] More secure hidden service as client or relay? 
When you run a relay, your ip become public so it gives some information
about you and your potential location. If your enemy knows that you are in
a specific region for exemple it could become dangerous for you !
On the other hand, it would be more difficult for your enemy to exploit the
dump of your communications to conclude that you are de hidden service
owner than if you run a client.
Don't forget to restrict the access to your service, don't let it open
world wide ;)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor relay denial of service 
I found a strange behavior in Tor relays that allow me to make a remote Tor
relay crash or at least have a 100 % CPU usage.
It crashes only if it is possible to send more data than RAM (and swap) can
store in 300 s (5 minutes) to the relay.
I attach a proof of concept.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor relay denial of service 
Strange that nobody can reproduce that ...
The 100 % CPU usage may come from the SSL uncompression.
I tested on an other computer (always runing the poc on the same host than
the relay) and it works.
My version of Tor on this computer is :
May 20 22:55:19.829 [notice] Tor v0.2.2.35 (git-73ff13ab3cc9570d). This is
experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity. (Running on
Linux i686)
Tor version 0.2.2.35 (git-73ff13ab3cc9570d).

You have the possibility to change the way tor is building his circuits in
the torrc file. You can even choose what exit node you want to use.

It depend where all those applications are hooked. If it only change system
settings it should not be a problem if you configured your applications
well because no DNS request sould be sent by "torified" client application.

Let's say Alice is a political opponent in a repressive regime. Alice hosts
his blog as a tor hidden service hosted at home.
The government knows about the blog and monitor it. It also monitor the
internet at a nation scale.
Case 1 : the government dosen't suspect any individual of being behind the
At 3 AM, the government start periodic flooding  the hidden service, with
an unique pattern (e.g. flood 5  minutes, wait 6 minutes, flood 13 minutes,
wait 2 minutes, flood 7 minutes ect.).
The government should be abe to get a very short list of suspects from a
bandwidth usage analysis. Go to case 2.
Case 2 : Alice is on a short list of suspects.
The government cut the Alice's internet access (or the electricity or her
house) and see what happen with the hidden service.
Looks easy no ?
Any way for Alice to mitigate such attacks ?
Two nodes hosting the same .onion in diffrent locations ?
Something else ?
