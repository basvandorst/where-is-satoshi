@_subject: [tor-talk] Cipherspaces/Darknets: An Overview Of Attack Strategies 
I sent this out as just an animation test awhile back, this one has
narration an is about 1hr long. This is essentially the talk I gave at
Defcon 19, but I had a little more time to cover the topic in this canned
Darknets/Cipherspaces such as Tor and I2P have been covered before in great
detail. Sometimes it can be hard to follow attack strategies that have been
used against them as the papers written on the topic have been academic and
abstract. What this talk will attempt to do is step back and give an
overview of the topic in a manner hopefully more conducive to the
understanding of security practitioners, giving more concrete examples.
While little to nothing in this talk will be "new and groundbreaking" it
should lead to a better understanding of how encrypted anonymizing networks
can be subverted to reveal identities.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Good web based email hidden server 
Hi All,
   Is there a recommended web based email sevice for Tor? Something
accessible as a hidden service, sort of like Susimail is in I2P. Perhaps I'm
seaching in the wrong places.

Hi All,
   I was hoping to get some recommendations on "must visit" Tor hidden
services. Both HTTP, and other protocols.
I found a few IRC server addressed, but I'm not sure which ones are up (they
could be down, or I may not have name resolution set right in my IRC

Hi all,
   I've tried t use a combination of the insturctions here:
and here:
to no avail. The service runs fine in Windows 7, but Vidalia will never
prompt me for a password for connecting to the live Tor. Tried with 0.2.1.30
and 0.2.2.30.
Where am I suppose to locate my Torrc in case that I'm running it as an NT
service? I've tried a few locations,
As a side note, running "tor -install"  says the option is depreciated, but
using the recommended "tor --service install" give the error:
Jul 28 15:41:53.469 [warn] Failed to parse/validate config: Unknown option
'service'.  Failing.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Workable Tor as service instructions for Win 7? 
Never mind, the instructions are more or less right. Had issues because of
the errors the non depreciated versions of the commands throw, plus configs
in the wrong place. I would still love to know where the default torrc
should be for a Windows service if you don't specify it.
To make Vidalia work again in Window after making Tor a service
1. CD into c:\Program Files\Vidalia Bundle\Tor and run:
tor --hash-password somepassword
Note:This is the hash you will use.
2: Add this to the torrc you will locate in C:\
ControlPort 9051
3. If the service is already installed, run:
tor -remove
4. Not run this to set up your config:
tor -install -options -f C:\torrc ControlPort 9051
5. Now when you start, Vidalia will ask for the password to connect.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Proxy Use 101 
Hi Rodger and gang,
    On a related note, from what you said in this thread and the fact polipo
is not in the Alpha I downloaded, I assume polipo is going away?  In the new
model, what is Tor doing as far as filtering things on the app level when it
comes to the webbrowser? Just relying on Torbutton/the custom browser? I'm
guessing it was mentioned in a blog post, so I am looking around.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Using TorButton with other proxies 
Hello all,
    I had a question I hoped someone here could point me in the right
direction on. I use Tor for some things, and I2P for others. I'd like to use
TorButton's javascript/plugins security protections to access eepSites over
I2P, but that means (unless I'm mistaken) toggling off Tor which I think
toggles off some of the security options. I can change the TorButton proxy
settings to point to I2P's 4444 port, but that's a pain to do every time.
Any way to be able to quickly switch proxies and keep TorButton's other
functionality working?
On a related note:I've played around with using the Tor browser bundle, and
set it up with a proxy switcher, to quickly switch to I2P and back as
needed. I noticed some privacy setting in the browser bundle are always on
(like not remembering history) even when the TorButton is toggled off.  My
issue is that I'm not sure what security features are kept even when the
button is off, and which ones disappear.
Oh, one final suggestion for the Tor Browser Bundle: A different icon. I
sometime run an instance of Tor's Firefox at the same time as an  instance
of plain jane Firefox, and it would be nice to be able to quickly tell the
difference in the task bar.
Thanks much for any info you can give,

I've been working on my common Darknet Weaknesses slides for AIDE and

only have about 50min to speak. First network animations are at about 50 sec
I plan to make more changes, and intend to take this video down later as
there are likely mistakes/omissions. The slides play at about 10 times
faster than I plan to speak. :)

Hi all,
   I was under the impression that the .onion names for Tor Hidden Services
were pseudo-random based on the public key. How was someone able to choose
one/choose some character in one? As an example:
 (hope it is not against policy to post that

@_subject: [tor-talk] Harvard student used Tor to send bomb threats, 
Not a lot of real details (and in case someone stumbles on this email
outside of the list, I'm not trying to explain how he could have gotten
away with it).
I assume Harvard:
1. Either tracks folks that connect to Tor entry nodes, or Tor's download
2. The looked at the "X-Originating-IP:" email header (Strangely, when I
tested Guerrillamail put my IP in this header).
Figured it was Tor traffic, and looked to see who was using Tor on the
campus network, and associate the MAC address with who signed on to their
The guy apparently confessed, but they may not have really had anything on
him besides using Tor. The cops may have said "Tell the truth and we will
go easy on you", which was not in his best interest.

Best guess, many client side and web app attacks Tor can't do much about.

in every case it was not Tor that was really broke)

should not have to spend as much time to explain how Tor works to them.

I reuse some alot of slides, just a different focus. I did Intro to
Darknets: Tor and I2P Workshop first, and it is a lot longer because I show
how to set things up, but it does not have as much detail about how people
got caught.

Hi all,
    I'm working on a talk that will be on real life examples of people
being caught while using Tor, and how it can be avoided. Basically it will
cover screw ups people make. I've already researched case examples like
Eldo Kim Harvard & the Harvard Bomb Threat, Hector Xavier Monsegur
(Sabu)/Jeremy Hammond (sup_g) & LulzSec, Freedom Hosting & Eric Eoin
Marques and  Ross William Ulbricht/"Dread Pirate Roberts" of the SilkRoad.
Any other notable cases I can look into?
