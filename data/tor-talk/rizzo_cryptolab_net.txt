Hi all,
There used to be an option for people in countries that block
Torproject.org to send an email to a bot and get a download link in
return. I cannot find this download option anywhere on the website,
and am wondering if we should make this more prominent. For many
people I know, this is the only option to download Tor, apart from me
passing on the file.
Also, when I once tried the email bot, the only option was to be sent
a download link to Dropbox, which isn't of much use when Dropbox is
also blocked in the country. Has there been any discussion on using
Amazon or Azure servers instead, following the same rationale like the
meek bridges?

Hi all,
In some big censored countries, meek pluggable transports are the only
option to connect to the Tor network without manually obtaining
bridges, a process which I believe many people don't understand enough
to figure it out on their own. Has there been any discussion on
whether meek could be made the default or at least recommended option
when configuring Tor for the first time from certain locations? Could
we detect the local time zone and then recommend a way to connect
based on location?

Hi Griffin,
Thanks for the info on Satori and confirming that GetTor is still
relying on Dropbox. Satori is a great idea, though many Android
devices in China, for example, don't come with Google Play anymore,
because so many Google services are blocked anyway. Maybe additionally
put it on F-Droid? I think the concept is great and useful in a range
of cases, especially if Bittorrent is an option. I think Amazon S3
often works in China, though not always.
To detect which way of connecting to the Tor networks works best from
a certain location, we could run Tor on virtual machines in censored
countries, and these installations could report back which method
works best. Volunteer reporters would be another option, but automatic
it would be nice.
Other ideas?
Though the installation of Tor has come a long way and is much easier
with the TorBrowser bundle, I think in heavily censored environments
that require manually choosing a connection method, we still loose a
good share of people who are overwhelmed with these very technical

Hi Nathan,
Yes, more assistance in solving a stuck connection process would be a
great improvement. Who would I have to pitch on that and possibly help
with usability? I'm not a developer, but I know UX.
For Orbot, does it support meek now?

Hi ilv,
It's been a while since I tried it. Tried again now and Github works
well -- nice! I didn't know that we are now listing several links for
download. This is good.
