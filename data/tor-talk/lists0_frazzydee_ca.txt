@_subject: fastestfox and too many connections 
Got in touch with the admin (email address posted here:   Hope I asked the right question.
Here is the response.
-------- Original Message --------
Thank you for this email.
Yes, FastestFox should obey Tor's settings. FastestFox is an Firefox
addon, and so it uses the API provided by Firefox to connect. Thus, it
will end up using whatever settings Firefox is configured to use.
The Awesomebar search queries Google using Google's AJAX API. Again,
this is using Firefox's API so it should obey whatever proxy settings
Firefox has been configured to use.
If you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask me.

Works for me.
Check the md5 signatures of your files against the .sig file.
If that matches, make sure your version of tar is un-gzipping before un-tarring (try 'tar -xzvf FILE.tar.gz', or 'gzip -dc FILE.tar.gz | tar To unsubscribe, send an e-mail to majordomo at torproject.org with

Since "he" in Marco's original post referred to the client's ISP, just to clarify, your ISP can't even see "leaked" data sent through Tor.  It would be encrypted before being sent through the Tor network.
Leaked data may compromise your anonymity if sniffed by an exit node, or by any intermediate router on the internet between the exit node and the To unsubscribe, send an e-mail to majordomo at torproject.org with

Sorry, I was wrong on this; I was thinking about a smaller subset of leaks.
