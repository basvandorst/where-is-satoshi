@_subject: No Tor server exists that allows exit to [scrubbed]:80. Rejecting. 
AFAIK (correct me if I'm wrong) near every tor server acts as a
directory - its a p2p network and so it is extremely unlikely for all
directory servers to be down.
Perhaps it was a temporary (weird) connectivity issue for you? I dont
know the network internals well enough suggest anything else.

I'm integrating this into CECID ( - nothing
releasable yet, but I'm hoping to have something soonish.

My Dlink modem crashes quite repeatedly, though I think thats a
combination of the modem not liking even small fluctuations in the
input power supply and a cheap power pack. Certainly it doesnt make me
ever want to buy Dlink products again - I've setup their wifi routers
for a few people and have had nothing but problems.
If you're not sure about setting up Linux/BSD yourself, try one of the
'router' distros like smoothwall [ Comes
with a nice web interface very similar to most embedded routers, but
with more options (and you can always ssh in to do command-line stuff
if you want). Certainly more fun if you're not used to iptables etc. I
set this up for a friend on an old P1 90mhz IBM Aptiva and its been
working fine for over a year now.
Hope this helps.

The client certainly hasn't had any work done on it for ages, so I was
thinking of ditching that, certainly after I discovered tor. It was
certainly a bit more complex than I bargained for :)
With the script, it hasn't been developed in quite a while. I have
been intending to do some work on it, though - I've got some working
code that should fix a few problems, like SSL, forms and cookies.
These fixes will also mean a rewrite of the HTTP fetching code, so
working in HTTP proxying shouldn't be too hard. I was actually
considering interfacing it with a proper anonymizer at some point,
like Tor, so I'd be happy to do that if thats what you want.
The script -shouldn't- be breaking stylesheets, so I'll have a look :)

Brilliant. I'll see if I cant get something going.

CGIProxy is quite good in my experience; it seems to proxify URLs
better than CECID does. It performs exactly the same task as CECID,
though CECID has a few extra features (banned word filtering).
I did mention a while ago that I would modify CECID to work as a
frontend for tor, but its not looking like I'm going to get time to do
that anytime soon (though I live in eternal hope). The codes all in
CVS ( if anyone's interested in picking it up and
working on it drop me a line.

Try  . If this works, you might need to update
your HOSTS file (C:/WINNT/system32/hosts on a windows system?).
You might need to update your apache config replacing 'localhost' with
'127.0.0.1' as well.

@_subject: Tor and port 80 
If you could determine the IP ranges used by the authorities, it would
be possible to reroute packets coming in on a particular port to a
HTTP server or a tor server depending on the originating IP. This is
assuming the authorities use a fixed set of IPs; though AFAIK IP
matching is used sucessfully on bittorrent clients like Azureus to
block RIAA/MPAA from connecting.
Again, if the "authorities" are smart then they could just change
their IP regularly.
