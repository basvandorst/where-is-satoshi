Roger told during the SummerDev meeting that Windows users have no
secure way to download a copy of GnuPG. I contacted Intevation, the
company which hosts GnuPG and other projects and got the following info.
If you are using Windows and want to download GnuPG, there is
. This site distributes copies for MS Windows
(see ). Binaries can be found at
The download page offers OpenPGP signatures. But if an attacker is able
to provide you with a forged version of GnuPG he also might be able to
print the correct signature lines ?
So Intevation told me that maintaining a TLS site for gpg4win is too
much effort. There are many projects which are hosted on that server.
But the files site is also available with a self-signed certificate.
What can you do to get gpg4win in a secure way?
1. Navigate to . This site offers to
   download the self-signed certificate and is secured by a certificate
   signed by GeoTrust.
2. When the certificate is imported, you can visit
    and choose the version (and the
   OpenPGP signature) to download.
   The browser should not show a warning, because the certificate is
   imported.
3. Now you can use the signature to verify the software.
