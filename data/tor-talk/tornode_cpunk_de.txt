You definitely shouldn't do that, since the tor-network is not capable of such a huge traffic-amount through P2P with bittorrent these days. By downloading with bittorrent via Tor, you take away the bandwidth from the people who really need it for browsing the web safely.  Regards,

@_subject: [tor-talk] To Toggle, or not to Toggle: The End of Torbutton 
Hi, I'm using separate tor+privoxy/polipo packages on my computers since several years now. Tor and the proxy are starting during the boot on my debian-machine. I've set up an own Firefox-Profile with torbutton for browsing the web via tor. I think it would be a no-go to stop serving standalone packages for tor. I'm connecting e.g. some of my chat-sessions to my already running tor-process, when logging in om my computer. It would be really bad, if I had to start a browser-bundle to do this. I hope, you're not planning to stop developing this standalone-packages? If this packages will exist furthermore in the future, I could live with an own pre-configured Tor-Browser-Bundle - but besides I'd like to have the possiility to configure my own Browser with torbutton. Regards,

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB as user debian-tor 
Hi, since the dropping of Torbutton and suggesting Tor Browser Bundle to use now, I was a little unhappy to start all Tor-processes as a normal user in Debian... Today I've changed the user of the directory tor-browser_en-US and all it's files to debian-tor with: chown -R debian-tor tor-browser_en-US/
Now it is possible to launch TBB as user debian-tor with the command: xhost + & sudo -u debian-tor /tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser
is this a good idea, or dangerous?
Regards, sigi

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB 2.2.32 & Automatic Updates 
Hi! Sorry, but at this point, I'm really asking myself, how I can trust the concept of the torproject anymore? Some time ago, the users were warned about the use of Torbutton with Firefox >3.6 - now the torproject recommends to use their TorBrowserBundle - but it has automatic updates for the browser included and some DigiNotar certificates? I'm confused. And I'd like some clarification here. Possibly I should switch back to my own browser-profile with torbutton? Is it as safe to use the Torbrowserbundle, as it was one year ago to use tor with your own browser with Torbutton? Is there any improvement? Regards, sigi

Pardon me for being so rude. I see how difficult this situation is for you Tor-devs! I think the most confusing point for me is the switch to the TorBrowserBundle. I'm using Tor a lot on my local machine - for xmpp, irc and www, and I'm certain it provides a great service for anonymity. The question for me was, if I can trust this Browser-Bundle enough for now. I'd really like to have such a document. Kudos to you all! Regards, sigi.

Hi, thanks for providing the new TorBrowserBundles! The download-site is still referencing older versions of this package on non-english-sites... like
The download-links there are still referencing version 2.2.32-2 for all operating systems. I think, this needs a fix? Best regards, sigi.

@_subject: [tor-talk] OpenPGP and Windows - offtopic 
You could give gpg4usb [1] a try: It is portable, runs from a usb-stick under linux and windows - and it's very easy to use. In gpg4usb you can write the text you want to encrypt, and copy/paste it to your webmailer - file-encryption is included, too. For Android, the only gpg-app I know, is APG [2] it works well with k9-mail [3]

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor users are not anonymous 
Hi, two main german technology news sites are spreading news about the study: ?Users Get Routed: Traffic Correlation on Tor by Realistic Adversaries? [1]
They write about 'broken anonymity' for Tor-users: Tor-Nutzer surfen nicht anonym - Tor users do not surf anonymously Tor-Benutzer leicht zu enttarnen - Tor users to easily expose
The articles are german-only - The main point was always stated by the Tor-devs [2], that anonymity ?fails when the attacker can see both ends of the communications channel? - can anyone out there assess how serious or new this really is?
Regards, [1] [2]
