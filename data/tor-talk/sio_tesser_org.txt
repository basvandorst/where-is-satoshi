At a guess, you're referring to the mailbox service at
torbox3uiot6wchz.onion? It's not affiliated with the Tor project, and
it's unlikely that anyone on this list can help you (unless the
operator of that hidden service happens to be subscribed).

Did you get Tails in the form of the DVD-R, or did you download the Tails
iso and write it to a DVD-R? Did you check out the "Verify the ISO
image" steps[0]?

Hi s7r,
Dead-simple for my part:
cat >> ~/bin/stresstest.sh < /dev/null
chmod +x ~/bin/stresstest.sh
I then ran twelve instances of the above script in
parallel (continuously in a `for ((;;))` loop) (four per host, three
hosts each with their own Tor instance). This was done for just over 72
hours from Jul 2 04:00 UTC. I'd meant to add some simple
metrics-gathering/reporting of request time and the like (or maybe just
Torify something like `siege`) but ultimately didn't get a chance.

Hi Flipchan,
Excerpts from Flipchan's message of 2015-11-14 09:32:15 +0100:
Yes. A lot of handy information about doing so has gone through this
list and the tor-relays list; searching at startpage[0] (or Google)
with something like `site:lists.torproject.org raspberry pi relay`
should give you a bit of background wrt others' experiences running RPi

Hi Colin,
Yep, that's the right terminology.
They might be. If you email the exit node operators[0] and let them know
you're receiving abusive traffic via the web (port 80/443), and include
the IP address(es) of your forum, they may be able to restrict their
exit policy to block traffic to your server. That said, there are
currently over a thousand exit nodes, most of which allow web traffic,
so this may not be the most efficient solution.
Another option is the Tor DNS blocklist[1]. If you have a dedicated
server or VPS you can configure it to reject traffic from Tor exits
(e.g., for Apache[2]). If you don't have a dedicated server or VPS, you
might be able to set this up in the forum software itself (e.g., for
I hope the above is helpful. Once the troll gets bored and goes away, I
hope you'll consider opening up your forum to well-behaved Tor users.
[0] Most exits have this information on a webpage served from the exit
node IP, e.g.,  you can also often find this
information via atlas, e.g.,
