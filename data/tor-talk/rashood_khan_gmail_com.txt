First of all, Happy New Year's to everyone. I am a sophomore student doing
majors in Computer Science. I would love to get involved with the TOR
Project, in terms of code development. I have taken a semester course on
C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms.
The problem I face is, I don't know where to begin with. Right now, I will
be able to give around 10 - 12 hours a week for the development. Strong
guidance is required.
