---------- Forwarded message ----------
Hello, my name is  Prashant Kumar and I am a student of B.Tech( Computer
Science and Engineering). Right now I am doing a summer Internship and my
project is to understand Tor architecture by studying Tor source code in
one one month and the problem is that there is no one in my team and
studying Tor source code is a very tedious task because i don't understand
where to start from. So can you people tell me something about it and some
advise how to study Tor architecture from Source code.
Thanks for your help in advance.
