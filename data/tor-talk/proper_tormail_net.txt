The problem is not just this site
Rather it's a problem with the wiki itself, for example also
is outdated.
No Tor end user should torify Firefox anymore. Few reasons listed under
look under 'Tor Browser (TB)'.
It is scaring how difficult it is to correctly configure an application
(such as Firefox for use with Tor (TBB)). If you see it like this, end
users really should stay away from to torifying software their self. They
can not just torify Opera and think they are done. Torifying Thunderbird
(with all important settings, plugins, addons, SSL, cookies, maybe some
patches like needed for Firefox) is probable equally difficult like
torifying Firefox.
A high percentage of the wiki is outdated as not actively maintained by
the original authors, the Tor Dev Team or anyone else. The wiki should be
seen more as a reference for developers. Maybe there should be a warning
at the top on each wiki site?
There is no quality policy. Evil people could just add some bogus
instructions on purpose. Anyone can edit and no one will check the changes
in detail. End users seam not to be aware of that. Maybe like wikipedia
there should be some sign like "last verified on x.x.x" and only trusted
people could do that. Or "new version, click here to see last verified
version from x.x.x.".
The safest thing for end users right now would be to stick with TBB or
Tails. I'll hope TorBOX
 may become an
alternative (no need to torify anything but potentially new
Torifying software for Tor end users is really dangerous (protocol leaks,
more reasons already listed above).

I am using a transparent proxy (all connections are forced through Tor).
The Tor Browser isn't just Firefox, it contains many security related
patches, settings and addons. Therefore I can't just go ahead and install
the addons myself into normal Firefox. [1]
There is even a patch to prevent Tor Browser to be started, when not
started from TBB Bundle (not started from Vidalia). [2] The build
instructions how to build Tor Browser are incomplete. [3]

Ghostery should not be added to TBB, it's not Free Software. No source
code available. TBB would rely on a single company.
If all that would not be the case, and if it's safe to implement, I'd be
happy to see it in TBB.
Same goes for Adblock Plus. If it's safe, it should come preinstalled with
TBB. Ads over Tor make no sense, you can not buy those things anonymously
and ads and tracking waste Tor's and users bandwidth.
The next version of TBB really should have Do-Not-Track enabled. If all
TBB users have it activated by default, there are no fingerprinting
issues. DNT is an opinion which all Tor users express by using Tor. I see
no disadvantages by activating DNT by default.

open up the xpi I don't see any binaries, but haven't looked at everything.
Closed source is the opposite of Open Source, and Open Source is much more
then just giving away the source code. It's about laws and licenses.
On ghostery.com I saw no source download and I didn't bother to download
the binary. Even if the binary is human readable, not compiled/obfuscated
torproject has no rights to redistribute it.
Ghostery's "Terms of Service" [1] are very restrictive. Torproject is not
allowed to redistribute, rebrand, modify, they would have to buy a license
(if possible). I don't think that is going to happen. If Ghostery had an
Open Source license, discussion if it could be added to TBB, would be
possible. As long as that is not the case, torproject needs a substitute.

@_subject: [tor-talk]  Hidden service security w. Apache/Win32 
running a hidden service under Windows.
Let's assume a fresh, clean windows installation. Have you found a list
and description of all outgoing network connections, that will be made by
that windows installation? I haven't found any documentation. Information
is spread all over the web. So far I discovered Windows Update, WGA and
time sync.
I am collecting all that information including source. [1]
There are still open questions. Is the time sync authenticated or can it
be spoofed by the Tor exit? How safe is it, to rely on Microsoft time sync
servers? (just one server, single point of failure)
Microsoft didn't always use automatic updates just for security updates.
They installed WGA without asking, which is spyware and no security
update. Or they installed a Firefox addon (net framework), which was a new
"feature", but not a security update for net framework.
How legal is Guantanamo, how much does the state following it's own laws?
Imagine Microsoft would push a backdoor over automatic updates, to bust cp
or a botnet. A small outcry through the geekzone, the masses would't
notice or care and continue to use Windows. How can we assume the state
has inhibitions to force Microsoft do to that, if Guantanamo is not even
an open secret?
environments more secure than having Apache and Tor listening within the
same machine?
I think yes and I am very interested in it. That's why I wrote TorBOX,
it's very similar to what you do. [2] There is also a section about hidden
services. [3]
But different opinions are possible. One could argue that a more
complicated setup and more code is involved, therefore even less secure.
It's probable a question what you think, what is/will be more probable
exploited? The VM (introducing more code) or the web server?
I'd be interested to read Tor developers opinion.
I think we agree that this virtual machine should only be used for the
hidden service, don't we? Since Windows costs money and is closed source
and while Linux/BSD is Free Software, and all common server software runs
also under *nix, so why not use it?
connects to an instance of Tor running within another VM, what info could
leak through the application other than the IP of the VM?
application level leaks, examples
- irc clients, if not well configured, leak your time zone, your current
time, your irc client version, maybe the name of your user account (some
clients, user account name = ident)
- browser fingerprinting [4]
- some webservers (in standard configuration) leak your operating system
- other (server) software has not yet been researched so thoroughly like
Firefox for fingerprinting and application level leaks (Thunderbird in
VM-1 would be unwise, it's very similar to Firefox fingerprinting)
Server software name and version can be potentially used to exploit the
server, once the VM is infected, it might break out of the VM and report
your real IP. If you can afford using real hardware, instant of VMs, that
would be more secure.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Improving Usability of Tor Browser? A new TBB-simple? 
For reference, there have been some thoughts already.
I like your ideas. Even more easy would be to see Tor integrated into
mainstream Firefox as the above described anonymous browse mode similar to
"start private browsing".
I am not sure how much load the Tor network and how much legal complaints
the exit server admins can handle.
Let's imagine it would be 100% foolproof, i.e. an "start anonymous
browsing" button in Firefox. Wouldn't too many users use Tor and Tor would
become so slow, that it's virtually of no use anymore? And wouldn't even
more fools abuse Tor for evil stuff?
Rather I am not sure how much easiness and anonymity can be combined.
People didn't understand Torbutton, they installed it and logged in into
Facebook with their real name. One who want to be anonymous needs some
decent education first on that topic.
I think, if you improve the easiness to use Tor, which gains more users,
you should, at the same time, use that opportunity, to improve the Tor
network (more bridges or relays). For example, the first, the user presses
the "start anonymous browsing" button, a small one time wizard could pop
up. Then explain what a bridge/relay is, and ask the user, if he wants to
contribute to the network. NAT would be an issue, but why not use upnp an
nat hole punching then?

It has nothing to do directly with Apache or the hidden service.
For correct operation Tor needs the correct time and date. Windows will

request is save (authenticated) - if not, an evil exit node can spoof the

ID of the Windows installation. I can't see how it could happen.
When Windows does it's Windows Update the serial number will be send to
Microsoft. Microsoft will see the IP of the exit node (the same one, which
you would see on whatismyip.com). Let's suppose you bought the serial
number from Microsoft, then can connect the serial and the exit node IP.
Microsoft is likely to cooperate with law enforcement and people working
there could be bribed. This proofs you are using Tor (which you wanted to
hide, by tunneling Tor through VPN first).
I have to admit, it's not easy to construct an attack to use that
information for deanonymization, would sound quite paranoid, but it's
about hidden services, so paranoia can not hurt, good security precaution
to avoid such things.
It can happen to any virtualization product.

There are many reasons, hopefully it's not required to agree on valid
reasons to get an answer. Right now most people use the unencrypted NTP
and it's accuracy seams to fit for Tor. I searched a lot but found only
the information "correct clock is important for Tor". But the question

@_subject: [tor-talk]  Tales from the DNSCrypt: Linux Rising 
It's an interesting update and I hope it will widespread along all public
DNS servers.
I am not sure how Tor users could profit from it.
- Exit node can not spy or even worse, spoof and redirect any DNS requests.
- Single point of failure, OpenDNS could be forced to redirect DNS
requests for some unwanted websites to a trap. This means it should not be
used as a 100% DNS replacement for Tor.
For sure it's not recommend to only rely on that new system, but
sometimes, if you suspect DNS spoofing exit node, encrypted OpenDNS may be
a reliable second opinion.
It's nice that DNSCrypt uses TCP, because Tor can forward TCP. It should
work and do not leak behind a transparent proxy. I am curious how to
torifiy it.

By default in TBB (Tor Browser Bundle):
- noscript active, no scripts allowed
- no plugins activated
Even if advised against, users might install and use flash anyway. A quick
research told me there are three possible ways to cloak the users IP while
using flash.
- if flash had proxy settings (no research on that)
- transparent proxy
- turning off plugin container in firefox (I read, flash won't get get
it's own process and would therefore use same settings as firefox. Source
 (in German, search for 'flash') I
have not verified this information.)
Personally, I wouldn't use any of these methods. Even if IP would be still
cloaked flash is still closed source and had in past way to many security
The problem with flashcookies is that users can be tracked even after they
deleted all their cookies using the firefox built in cleaner.
Anyway, I'd to hear if it would make sense to kill flashcookies with TBB
or TorButton. This could be implemented either by using one of the
existing firefox addons (such as BetterPrivacy) or by adding this feature
into TorButton.

I wouldn't use it. This story is similar to JanusVM.
Dunno when ra last time updated the software package but the blog entry

16th, 2011. Which means ra's package probable does not contain the latest
version of Tor.
Many people (ra, JanusVM, me) are interested in deploying something ra
calls 'Tor Workstation', which might not be the most bad name. (an
isolated machine which routes everything transparently through Tor)
As long as this project isn't an official Tor package it seams somewhat
difficult to keep it as current as the latest Tor release. People get busy
with their lives, forget about the project or loose interest. Problematic
thing about this is that Tor users will still find old discussions on
Google and still download and use potentially dangerous old Tor versions.

That would be great. I would feel a lot saver if this were an official Tor
project. It would have a few benefits. The Tor developers would check the
VMs for security. Many geeks get aware of it, download it and check the
security again.
Currently I am still working on my own implementation.
As you may see the VM approach isn't that much work and it's certainly not
rocket science.
I will research how 'virtual machine portable' this may be. Hopefully the
same virtual machine disc image may be used across most emulators at the
same time.
Another idea would be not to supply a whole virtual machine but therefore
an .deb package. The .deb package would contain the necessary firewall
rules, torrc settings and so on to convert a linux box into a Tor gateway
I'll see that there is already a design document on the Tor server.
I hope not. Let's hope for some feedback but as this document is already
on torproject.org and we have transproxy settings in torrc I assume they
can't be too negative about this idea. Just a question of effort and time.

Not with the VM setup but my final goal is to use three cpu's. The goal of

either VMs or real hardware. Real hardware should be the most secure way.
Ones is a normal non-anonymous workstation, one is the Tor-Gateway and one
is the Tor-Workstation.
You may dislike the idea with three boxes, that's why I wrote cpu's, not
computers. Maybe a desk computer, a netbook and something fancy such as a
TV box, an old router or mobile phone with linux as TorGateway.
Maybe that's a feature request for tails. First operating system could be
a hypervisor, as guest the Tor Gateway which remains invisible and the Tor
Workstation what top you see right now.

@_subject: [tor-talk] IDEA: Compress traffic at exit 
I see three different ways to compress traffic. 1), 2) and 2) They could
be all implemented alone or all in combination.
1) website compression
Long time ago I tested services like traffic compressor (a free legitimate
public proxy). It really enhanced the speed, especially websites with lots
of high quality pictures.
The exit server would hook into all outgoing unencrypted http connections
and compress the website using a similar mechanism like services like
traffic compressor. An option to opt-out or opt-in this feature for the
exit and the Tor-user would be needed as well.
2) caching proxy
Just like existing caching proxys. The exit server would safe bandwidth if
they wouldn't always request all websites fresh but use a local cache.
Also option for both, Tor-user and exit server if they wish to use the
3) connection compression
- it would put more cpu load on the Tor-user, but he could get an option
if wants to use compression or not
- it would put more cpu load on the exit node as it would have to
uncompres the date before sending it to the target server
- therefore also the exit nodes could get an option if they accept
compressed connections or not, if they want to safe cpu load
- a research would be needed if that compression would weaken encryption
(but normally with good encryption it shouldn't matter what they encrypt,
even public known things should be fine)
- this method of compression would put less load on the entry and middle
- the exit nodes would have to decompress and to forward the traffic as
usual, so they wouldn't safe bandwidth
