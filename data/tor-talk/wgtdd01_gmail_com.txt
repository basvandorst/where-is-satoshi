@_subject: Can I run a relay when I can't port forward? 
Hello all,
that does not provide port forwarding for incoming data. My  understanding of network protocols has always been a little fuzzy but  I was wondering if I connected to a proxy could I use that to make my  relay visible to other relays.  The proxy can be transparent, all it  has to do is route traffic to me. Then I could act as an exit node. Is  this practical? Is any proxy I find going to be too slow to be useful?  How would I go about finding a (free) proxy(s) (I think it would have  to support SOCKS 4 or 5)? Does any one else do this? Is there some  easy way that I am missing?
