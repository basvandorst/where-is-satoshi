This. Take your petty bullshit to facebook. People sign up to this list to read about tor, and nothing else.

I think this is a pretty good idea. I see it as something like OAuth, or Facebooks universal login thing, whatever they call it. There may be a problem with it defeating the purpose of Tor though, since you are now trying to track users... 5 hours is far too long though. For people to use it, it would have to be less than a minute, I think. Which is still enough to stop the mass creation of accoutns for spamming. I have some spare time at the moment and need a new project. Might look into this...

Seems like you'd just end up with a kind of chicken and egg problem.....

Has anyone else noticed how most (read: most that I've tried) of the sites on the hidden wiki have been down for about 2 weeks?
And that torchan is asking for a username and password?
What's up with that?

That was the initial worry, but hasn't it since been shown that NSA strengthened DES against a type of attack only they knew about?

How about people not wanting to receive [tor-talk] or [tor-relays] mailing list emails anymore? Apparently people need a hand with that.

If someone has trouble unsubscribing from an email list they probably don't run their own mail server.

Hash: SHA1
Heya List
I've recently started on developing a nagios plugin for tor, since a cursory google search didn't come up with anything I would describe as 'comprehensive.'
Generally speaking, it works by connecting to the control port and running various commands to check the health of the server. You would either drop it on the Tor box and run it with NRPE, or on the monitoring server and open your control port to that IP.
So far I've implemented / plan to implement the following checks:
* Fetch a page through the socks port
* Check if the server is hibernating
* Check the current bandwidth (up and down combined)
* Check the accounting values (how close to hibernation)
* OR / Dir port reachable
It's in a very early stage at the moment, but I'm posting here now to ask: Are there any other checks relay operators would want to see implemented?
You can check out the code so far at
