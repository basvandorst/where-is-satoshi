@_subject: My exit node is gone from the node list 
Hi all,
For several months, I've been running a tor exit node (Nickname: AllenHomeTor, IP address: 98.216.176.128, Version:0.2.0.30(r15956)). Since a few days, it seems to have vanished from the list of nodes. And I try to make it reappear by using a new nickname AllenUSATor(fingerprint: 443E 035C B856 5904 AE98 8DAB 3059 9A0D 2C4C 340C), but I am failed. How can I make it reappear? In addtion, my traffic logs suggest that the node is used as much as it could be. There are much traffic like BitTorrent. I am confused. How can these guys select my exit node even my node has vanished from the list of nodes? BTW, to avoid too much BitTorrent traffic, I change my exit policy to only accept port 80 now.
I look forward from your feedback, and thank all responders in advance.
Many thanks,
Allen Ling

Hi Scott Bennett,
Thanks for your kind reply. I agree with your deduction that the possibility you mentioned that inside tor somewhere that causes tor to forget to post a descriptor update after the usual 18 hours have elapsed. I will read the source code about it.

versions in the stable branch are 0.2.0.33 and 0.2.0.34 for both clients and
     Second, when tor starts up, does it issue a message that says that your
node is reachable from outside?  If not, then you probably have a NAT/RDR
problem to settle with your gateway.
     Third, if tor does find itself reachable soon after startup, does it ever
issue a message that says its IP address appears to have changed?  Or that its
DNS queries appear to be hijacked?  In the former case tor should, after
passing another reachability test, simply publish a new descriptor bearing the
new IP address.  In the latter case, tor should stop operating as an exit and
issue a message to that effect, while continuing to operate as a non-exit
     How can you tell what sort of traffic it is if your node is no longer an
exit node?  Why close all those other non-Bittorrent ports as well?
     There remains another possibility.  As several of us have reported here
in the past, there has been a gremlin lurking inside tor somewhere that causes
tor to forget to post a descriptor update after the usual 18 hours have
elapsed.  I haven't yet seen it happen with 0.2.1.14-rc, but it was a headache
with some earlier versions.  However, when you changed your torrc, whether for
the change of nickname and identifier or for the change of exit policy, tor
should still have published a new descriptor reflecting either of those
changes, so the authorities ought to have a new descriptor for at least another
18 hours.  Try upgrading to a current version of tor, and then check it a
couple of times a day (or more often if you like) for a while to see whether
the problem recurs.

Seems that it's a weak point of current Tor architecture. From a network manager's point of view, simply blocking the Tor nodes posted in Tor directory servers will infuence Tor users dramatically in the local network. (For those of you who want to be on tor-relays, you can learn more about
it at  )

Hi Roger,
Thank you for your advice. Seems the bridge relay is a kind of new Tor relay. I will try it. Thanks!
Well, yeah. That's why we designed bridge relays, if you're a user in
this situation.
Turn it around and think of it as a strength -- you can use bridges by
default, but for those who don't yet need them, we provide a much easier
way of using Tor too. :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Bug? 
Hi all,
I run my Tor client for a couple of days and got the same error twice. The version of my Tor client is 0.2.2.34. And my OS is Fedora 15. Here is the error from the Tor:
Nov 25 23:35:15.850 [err] connection_stop_reading(): Bug: main.c:338: connection_stop_reading: Assertion conn->read_event failed; aborting.
main.c:338 connection_stop_reading: Assertion conn->read_event failed; Aborted (core dumped)
any ideas?
Thanks & regards,

According to the recent research of [1], I think it is useless to obtain the new bridges that does not support Obfsproxy [2] in China. Even if the Chinese users derive the new bridges which are not blocked in China, once the bridges are used by them, these bridges will be promptly discovered by GFC based on the protocol-level bridge discovery approach and then blocked. Therefore, currently, in order to effectively connect to the Tor network in China, the Chinese users should use the Obfsproxy to obfuscate the specific feature of the TLS protocol used by Tor. Since SkypeMorph [3] is not widely deployed, Obfsproxy is the only tool that we can use.
However, how do people in China retrieve the Obfsproxy supported bridges? Still obtain them via emails or https? [1] indicates that the 13 hard-coded obfsproxy bridges in the official obfsproxy bundle have been already blocked.
