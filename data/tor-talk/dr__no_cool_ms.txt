@_subject: Firefox,Torbutton leaks real IP Address. 
i think the main problem is that via java/javacript the browser can do direct
connections, bypassing your proxy and only using your default gateway!
You can see this bypassing with test sites like  .
That's why i am not using a default gateway on the PC i am using and usually you
only need proxy and no default gateway (behind the Router with the firewall and proxy).
For some situations like updating my homepage via ssh/rsync i'm using a default gateway but only for a short time (approx. 1 minute) and at
that time i'm using no browser.

@_subject: They know I'm using a proxy(Tor)...but how? 
yes, but this method has two bugs:
a) Tor exitnodes with dynamic IPs do change their IP so that they usually can
not be found on these lists. And someone who is using such an IP some time
later gets blocked!
b) When the output traffic (to port 80) is forwarded to another IP, e. g. with a
transparent proxy which has another proxy as parent proxy, the parent proxy
and not the Tor exitnode gets blacklistet!
I can see this with my Tor exitnode at home: Directly i can connect every page
which blocks TOR and the proxy of my provider, which is no Tor exitnode, gets blocked because that proxy, which is neigther open nor anonymizing, is on about
half of the blacklists.

@_subject: About WLAN and monitoring.. 
If that' illegal, it would mean that you can't produce NICs in that country because you can't assign a MAC! The reason is that after production
of the hardware there is always a MAC; usually 00:00:00:00:00:00 or ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
and to set a "real" MAC you have to change the MAC. I have done this dozens of
And because a standing target is easier to hit, a static MAC is a security risk,
and these countries are less safe e. g. to penetration attacks. Therefore i'm using macchanger:
Another reason is that a MAC can simply be logged and copied, so everyone can copy "your" MAC and do nasty things with it. To avoid trouble caused by "your"
MAC in log files, the only way is to use another random MAC!
Which countries are affected of static MACs?
Only north Korea and Iran or some more "evil" countries?

i tried to upgrade from version 0.1.2.16 to 0.1.2.18 but i see that my TOR server
does not use the limit of 90 KB; it's only about 10 % (about 9 KB).
I put HttpProxy 127.0.0.1:3128
into the torrc but that changed nothing and for the 0.1.2.16 version this was not
necessary because it works fine with the transparent and non-transparent squid.
How can i get the 0.1.2.18  version using the full BandwidthRate?
And how can i get a faster increase of the traffic up to the limit?
I'm changing my IP every metric hour and i see that my TOR server needs about
half an hour to increase the traffic up to the limit.

i'm changing my public IP number ten times per day and to avoid confusion,
i'm stopping my TOR server before and starting after the number change. But after the start TOR is very slow.
Is there a better way to tell the TOR server that the public IP has changed?

@_date: 2008-01-07 21:19:11
@_author: dr._no@cool.ms 
@_subject: What to do at IP number change? 
it's because a moving target is harder to hit; it's more safe to change the IP number
often. Another point is that states like germany do like IP numbers so much that they do
data retention and therefore i give them what they want - many IP numbers ;-)
So i should use a DynDNS host+domain name?

@_author: dr._no@cool.ms 
@_subject: What to do at IP number change? 
that's clear; i'm using TOR as a mix with a transparent local http proxy which uses an ISP
proxy as parent proxy, so that the exit traffic goes through two proxies and with several numbers
in the X_FORWARDED_FOR header ;-)
That's good enough for hiding my public IP to http servers which do log only the TCP/IP number and
for most which do evaluate the X_FORWARDED_FOR header. And because of the mixing the ISP can't see which traffic is caused by me. So he can see a TOR server
which uses one of his proxies but not my personal traffic. For obfuscation i opened all exit ports except
25 (because of spam).
Ok, i will use
but what exactly shall i write into that file?
killall -s SIGHUP tor?

@_date: 2008-01-07 23:26:13
@_author: dr._no@cool.ms 
@_subject: What to do at IP number change? 
that would be useless because i do change the public IP number ten times
a day; such a scanning can never be fast enough to find all TOR servers.
Another point is that i'm not rich and have only one public IP number.  So
if someone blocks that IP number, he blocks me when i'm NOT using TOR.

@_author: dr._no@cool.ms 
@_subject: What to do at IP number change? 
with a transparent proxy +ISP proxy they can get abuse complaints
about their proxy or maybe (with really good http header evaluation)
about my proxy. So the complaints are all about proxys but not about
a customer.
I think that's a bad idea because many people think that you can identify a person
by using the IP number and i don't want to support that myth. If everyone would use tor, the only sure thing about IP numbers and identification would be that if you
find an IP number in an log file, you can be sure that this person (the one who pays
for that internet access) was NOT there!
Another point is that without a tor server my home would be vulnerable to traffic analysis and a further point is that a tor server is more safe than only a client.
That's no problem: Common private internet access is highly assymetric. In germany it is e. g. 16.000 kbit/s down and 1.000 kbit/s up but tor is symmetric. So from the theoretic maximum of 17.000 tor can use only 2.000 - roughly one tenth. That's not much.

And i simply wanted to see what happens with absolutely no censorship.
It's interesting to see how much my ISP cares and writes a snail mail
with suggestions for a virus scanner which also can detect trojan horses ;-)
But i think opening port 25 is a bad idea because since october 2006 i do get more than thousand spam mails per day.

@_subject: What to do at IP number change? 
i've been killing the tor server via torctl stop before my disconnects and restarting
via torctl start (i also restarted squid and privoxy).
Now i'm using killall -s HUP tor and the traffic increases faster after
an ip change.
So there should be no problem.

@_subject: Input required on Secure Wiki project 
that's wrong: TOR also countermeasures traffic analysis and other sorts of information
That's why i'm using TOR also for IRC and ICQ. To countermeasure taking a public IP number e. g. from an email header into a log file via an editor (e. g. for impeaching for terrorism or child porn or something else) it's also
necessary not to use your public IP number directly.
Another point is that i licensed no one to see my public IP number and that no one pays
for seeing my public IP number.
If someone, except my provider, wants to see my public IP number, he has to pay 1 Euro per IP number plus 1 Euro per day.
And pages like wikipedia.org are no problem: I've got some neighbors with open WLANs
and there are also thousands of open proxies in the internet.
By the way: I switched to changing my public IP number only five times per day (every second
metric hour).

@_subject: Tor operator raided in Finland 
i also thought about it and it's possible to e. g. to hide a WLAN or powerline NAS in a wall,
but that's expensive and i do prefer encryption - even for all of my backups
and my backup in the safe-deposit box.
That does cost nothing (except some performance, some seconds for creation an the password for mounting) and it's save. And i've read reportsthat the police sometimes also takes printers and other PC stuff, so an
UPS is not a good idea.
Currently i'm putting my root file system on an USB key, following the encrypted root filesystem
howto, in a partition of type 0 (officially empty).
And if you use a small USB key, e. g. an Sony Micro Vault Tiny, you can hide it nearly everywhere,
because it's so small: If you have small children, you first should make sure that it can not get swallowed ;-)
If someone, e. g. a judge or policeman, asks you for the password you can simply forget it or say that due to
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 14, paragraph 3,  chapter g, you
can not be forced to tell someone else the password:
So asking for a password is a suspect trick, because since the romans the principle that you can't be compelled to testify against yourself or to confess, e. g. by telling someone else a password, is standard
and known as "nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare".
So if someone forces you to give a password it is highly illegal a) du to international law, b) against more
than more than 2000 years of jurisdiction, c) against the freedom of thought (a password which is created
by your brain is only a thought) and several other constitutional principles.
In germany the "nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare" is specified as STPO Paragraph 55.
Another point is that a good password is hard to create; therefore you can reclaim the international copyright for your good passwords.
If someone would ask me for a password, i would spam, tell wrong passwords, to waste his time, which could
be used to ask others for passwords ;-)

you should keep your keys only on encrypted partitions and backups with "forgotten" passwords
to avoid revoking GPG keys.
And you should use a transparent proxy plus a provider proxy as parent proxy for the exit traffic of
your TOR server, because usually only the TCP/IP IP number gets logged; e. g. logged by an Apache with
default configuration and most other software.
Well, sometimes shit happens and TOR servers are raided also in germany, where they are legal, so
usually the raiding of a TOR server is only temporary and threads are only idle threats.

if you use a transparent proxy plus a provider proxy as parent proxy
for your TOR server, you can simply avoid that ;-)
To be absolutely sure, you can restrict the TOR output to port 80 and and use
transparent http proxying to port 80, plus a provider proxy as parent proxy.
I'm runnig a TOR server for more than two years with no blocked port (except 25 since late 2006),
proxied port 80 since 2007 and had no significant problems.

@_date: 2008-01-27 12:55:43
@_author: dr._no@cool.ms 
@_subject: Tor operator raided in Finland 
yes, not absolutely sure, but up to now only the TCP/IP IP number has been used
against TOR server operators in germany, and as far as i know also in other countries.
And i'm using two dozens of IP numbers in the headers of my transparent proxy, so
it's neither easy nor sure to find the IP number of my internet connection.
Another point is that logging has several flaws: The provider proxies do have thousands of connections per second, but the clocks of the computers have an
accuracy of about one minute. So without connection tracking, e. g. with cookies,
digging in the log data yields unsure results, especially with dynamic IPs.

@_date: 2008-01-27 18:31:03
@_author: dr._no@cool.ms 
@_subject: Tor operator raided in Finland 
Yes and because in germany there is no logging at the proxy servers (maybe in  2009
this will change) it increases my chance significant.
And another point is that the HTTP headers can be simply faked (filled with the content you
want) and send from via an open proxy (which does not modify the headers), and that the headers are not unique: When i download with wget and specify a proxy, the transparent proxying produces TWO X-Forwarded-For-Headers, not a concatenation!
So logging and evaluating the HTTP headers makes things more complicated but not more safe
for identification. I think that switching from "identification" via TCP/IP IP number to header number(s) would cause mass abuse via open proxies and would be used for indirect DDNS attacks with the
TCP/IP IP number of the victim in the header(s), e. g. for blacklisting.

yes, and what i meant is "wasting as much time as possible", so after about a dozen of wrong passwords it should be clear that i can't/will not tell the right one and that's the right time to say that the password is forgotten.
For this i have several never used passwords for confusing; e. g. "secret" because a password should be secret and "common" passwords are simple ;-)
On my PC with the TOR server i've got a self-made sticker (with signature, date and stamp)
which says that a TOR server is running on this PC since some years and with a short
explanation of TOR and that ALL log files do get deleted every day by overwriting before
unlinking and some other stuff on that PC.
Even if it does not help against raiding, it helps getting the hardware back earlier and close
the case soon, because the observers are looking for something like a dokument to close the case or find evidences. But after a first look, they see that there are really no
evidences and the only wise action is to close the case.

i know that there's a RIPA act in UK, but some laws are illegal,
e. g. the Nuremberg Laws, and they doe not affect the international laws and do not impress
international courts like the  European Court of Justice, And you don't need to forget the password; it's enough to mistake the
password, you have been asked for, with others - nobody is perfect ;-)
