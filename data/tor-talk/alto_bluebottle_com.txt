hi madjon and all
(1) i did a google search for "how to check firewall ports address hosts file" and up came a list of online port scanners
i chose pc flank
and the reslut below scared me, so i deleted the 4 ports i had manually opened below.
(2) i do not think i have a router ...
what do you think is the next step for me now?
  :9090 - Private OR Port
  :443   - Public OR Port
  :9091 - Private DIR Port
  :80     - Public DIR Port

We have scanned your computer' ports used by the most widespread trojan horses. Here is the description of possible ports' statuses:
"Stealthed" (by a firewall) -Means that your computer is invisible to others on the Internet and protected by a firewall or other similiar software;
"Closed" (non-stealthed) - means that this port is closed, but your computer is visible to others on the Internet that can be potentially dangerous;
"Open" - Means that this port is ready to establish (or has already established) a connection with remote address. It also means that your computer is vulnerable to attacks and could have been already hacked or infected by a trojan/backdoor;
