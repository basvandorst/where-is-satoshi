It always will.. the output of UPX is an 'exe' file.
If you need to compress only an exe file in itself.. go for UPX. UPX is not
an extraction utility.. its a PE compressor. If compressed with UPX, your
exe will run as usual , except they'll be much smaller in size.

@_subject: 1 Mb d/l on startup.. can this be avoided? 
Upon startup Tor downloads around 1 mb of stuff.. which I suspect is the
network/circuit information. My ISP limit per day is around 12 Mb traffic
up/down a day and I normally boot up my box 3-4 times a day. Ans i get this
1 mb overhead everytime.
What is contained in this 1 Mb of traffic?
Is there anyway to stop/reduce this startup traffic?
Can i not reuse what was downloaded only a few hours back?

@_subject: initial directory bandwidth? 
Hi all,
I used TOR around a year back, but couldn't use it much as initial
setting up (directory and initializations) took up around 1 mb of my
download. Multiply that by 7 or 8 reboots per day and I lost serious
What is the situation now? How much does the directory weigh (if
present at all) and what are the average speeds one gets with TOR now.
I used to be able to have 20 KBps.. which wasn't blazing fast but

Thanks for the reply.
The reason I need to reboot is I constantly shift b/w windows/
Solaris/ linux (for gaming/projects I'm working on). I'll have a go at
the current version of TOR.

Its not you that that the provider will log but the Exit node, as all
your traffic goes via the exit node. The provider (or mode
specifically the DNS server) will see it as a request by the exit
node, and will see that it doesnt exist, and will show the exit node
the search page.. and this is forwarded to you by the exit node).
So if the provider is logging information, it will log information
coming from the exit node. If you're using plain http (instead of
https) then the provider can possibly sniff any username passwords and
other data you may enter.
