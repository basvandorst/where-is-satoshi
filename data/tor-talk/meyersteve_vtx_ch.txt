Just go and take the easy way.
You have to choices:
Try to recover the file with your finger print (there are lots of program on
the web).
Or change your nickname and use a new fingerprint...

Objet : Different fingerprint problem
As i made an upgrade (because of the high processor usage together with
trickled) from tor version debian-0.1.0.15-1 to 0.1.1.8-alpha-cvs i think i
forget at the first start from the alpha to import the original fingerprint
from the debian version, because i get the error message: [warn]
connection_dir_client_reached_eof(): http status 400("Rejected: There is
already a verified server with this nickname and a different fingerprint.")
response from dirserver '86.59.5.130:80'. Please correct. A subsequent import of the fingerprint produces two servers with the same
name but different fingerprints at the router-status at
 and always the error message from above.
Don't find a solution in the archives so is there a way to fix it on my
server-side?

I am Planning to use Tor with Privoxy.
But I could not find anywhere the plug-in for Tor (or Privoxy)  and I am not
able to do one my self.
I anybody has already done it or if some one wants to take the challenge, it
would really help me, and I would be very grateful.

i distinctly recall mention of a live XP boot cd with tor/privoxy installed
and configured
you don't need a plugin, you just need to define default settings for the
browser/system to: a) start up tor and privoxy b) use privoxy as the proxy

@_subject: Calling TorCP from an other program 
I am trying to do a very simple program that would load torCP on command.
But I get this very strange problem when loading torcp threw my program (it
does not happen when I double click on it).
I get a message telling me that "system cannot find the path specified"
Then I get as screen asking me to register a demo of Compiler PE.
Does it mean we cannot call torCP from an other program or am I doing
something wrong?
Thanks for any help.
