Hi, does anybody know how I can hardcode the Tor nodes I would like to go
through, instead of using the Tor algorithm for finding the best circuit?
Thanks, Eric

Hi all,
Does anybody know of any free, public (or semi-public) proxies that I can use?
A google search returned some sites but a lot of the proxies listed
are not working, although I can ping them.

@_subject: Help with directory mirror 
I need some help with a directory mirror that I already set up.
I have 3 directory mirrors set up, each having PublishServerDescriptor
= 0 and DirPort and ORPort set. Let's call them DirectoryMirror1,
DirectoryMirror2, DirectoryMirror3.
Then I have 3 of my own computers that I set up as Tor Onion Routers
(servers). Let's call them Tor1, Tor2, and Tor3. Each of them have the
correct DirServer lines pointing to DirectoryMirrorX.
Now, I have a client with the DirServer lines pointing to
DirectoryMirrorX and which tries to setup a circuit with TorX as a
node in the circuit. This fails. Note that DirectoryMirrorX does have
TorX in its cached-status.
However, if I have the client with the same DirServer lines try to
setup a circuit with the other Tor nodes (the "real" ones on the
network), this works.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

@_subject: Help with directory mirror 
Roger, thanks for the reply. See below for my comments.
DirectoryMirror{1,2,3} have AuthoritativeDirectory = 1. So the Tor OR will
use those 3 DirectoryMirror{1, 2,3} as authoritative directory servers.
I made sure to rm -Rf ~/.tor/cached-*
Thanks for the reply.
What I am trying to do is be able to set up circuits with both the "real"
Tor nodes and my own Tor nodes being part of the circuit. However, I would
like to keep my Tor ORs private so that they don't appear in the directory
servers for anybody else to use, because they are just being used as part of
a test.
Setting up a Tor OR to connect to the default authoritative directory
servers but with PublishServerDescriptor=0 and then in the Tor client
EntryNodes=Tor1 and StrictEntryNodes=1 does not seem to help either...
unless I am doing something wrong.

I agree with you and I am /not/ trying to set up an authoritative directory

I have been trying to setup my own "private" directory servers, but
without much luck. Does anybody know if there's a how-to or some other
information about how to setup your own directory server somewhere?
I have 3 computers, each running a directory server. They all do *NOT*
talk to the 5 authoritative directory servers (moria1, moria2, tor26,

Hi all,
Is there a way to setup your own directory server? Is the source code/binary
for the directory server available for download?
Thank you,

============================== START ==============================
Thank you for the info.
However, I would like to set up my own directory server on a real network
(PuppeTor is only a simulation). I could not find the source code or the
binary where I can compile and deploy my own directory server, where my own
Tor ORs will contact.
Any ideas if that is possible?
Thanks, Eric

@_subject: Setting up private Tor network with the real one 
Hi all,
I have my own private Tor network (with 3 directory servers and some Tor
servers) running, and I wanted my Tor client to talk to both my directory
servers and the real hard-coded directory servers.
Right now, my private Tor network is completely separate from the real Tor
network. So, none of my directory servers or my Tor servers show up in any
of the hard-coded directory servers. Although that will be much easier, I
don't want my Tor servers to show up in the hard-coded directory servers.
I have my Tor client and want to be able to choose between both my Tor
servers and the real Tor servers for building a circuit. However, since my 3
directory servers and the 3 (I chose moria1, moria2, and tor26) hard-coded
directory servers don't agree on router descriptors (since the two networks
are disjoint), I am never able to establish any circuit.
I tried to go through the source code to change the check so that even if
one directory server says it has the router descriptor for a Tor server
(call it A), and the other 5 don't have A, it will still use A as a node in
the circuit. However, that didn't work, most likely because I didn't change
the correct code or something else.
Any ideas about how to make this work will be much appreciated.

So, there is no way for me to build a circuit where I have two
completely different directory servers? Even if I change the source

@_subject: Some router descriptors not being downloaded 
I found out that some router descriptors are not being downloaded. For
example, on  (the Tor status page), it
shows that 1000rpm is up and running. When I start Tor (I just
upgraded to the latest stable version to make sure it was not a
version issue), it says
routerstatus_list_update_from_networkstatus(): Router '1000rpm' is
listed by 5/5 directories, named by 2/3, validated by 5/5, and 3/3
recent directories think it's running.
But 1000rpm is not listed under either ~/.tor/cached-routers or
cached-routers.new, so somehow Tor does not know about this router
since it doesn't have its descriptor.
I tried the basic stuff: remove ~/.tor, restart tor, upgrade to latest
version, etc... I even used the ControlPort to check if Tor has the
router descriptor and it does not. I have been trying for the past 5
hours or so now.
I thought that Tor was supposed to download ALL router descriptors
from the directory servers/mirrors.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you,
PS: This has nothing to do against 1000rpm, it was just one of the
first Tor routers that I noticed is considered "up", but not on my
cached-routers list - I am sure there must be others

@_subject: Some router descriptors not being downloaded 
I think I figured out that Tor needs time since it periodically
downloads new router descriptors. However, although the Tor status
page (and the directory servers ) show the 3 Tor nodes I am using to
be up, I am still unable to build a circuit, even though I downloaded
the full list of descriptors.
When Tor starts up, it of course tries to rebuild its descriptor list
and replacing entries, etc.. but then it still fails with

@_subject: Some router descriptors not being downloaded 
The descriptors do show up in cached-routers and/or cached-routers.new
(is there a time limit as to when Tor would use those descriptors?)
I don't see any cached-descriptors and I am using tor 0.1.2.19. I was
using an older version earlier and just updated yesterday. I also
don't see any cached-consensus files under ~/.tor
I stop and restart all the time... I would like not to have to run Tor
for hours to be able to use the Entry/Exit nodes I want.
Thanks for the reply.
