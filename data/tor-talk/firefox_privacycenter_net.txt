@_subject: The ultimate exit policy 
Hash: SHA1
Hey all,
Below is my current default-allow exit policy. I get a lot of traffic, and I'm wondering if there are any other high bandwidth/low utility common ports that I should block. I want to allow everything with the exception of those services, such as some file-sharing clients, which are often problematic from a security and/or dealing-with-RIAA/MPAA's-crap perspective. Any suggestions would be helpful.
The exit policy:
ExitPolicy reject 0.0.0.0/8
ExitPolicy reject 169.254.0.0/16
ExitPolicy reject 127.0.0.0/8
ExitPolicy reject 192.168.0.0/16
ExitPolicy reject 10.0.0.0/8
ExitPolicy reject 172.16.0.0/12
ExitPolicy reject *:25
ExitPolicy reject *:119
ExitPolicy reject *:135-139
ExitPolicy reject *:445
ExitPolicy reject *:1214
ExitPolicy reject *:4661-4666
ExitPolicy reject *:6346-6429
ExitPolicy reject *:6699
ExitPolicy reject *:6881-6999
ExitPolicy reject *:60679
ExitPolicy reject *:41919
ExitPolicy accept *:*

Is there a work-around for the default AccountingMax  behavior, which is to disable dirport advertising? I have AccountingMax enabled so I know exactly how much tor bandwidth I'm donating per day, but it would be nice if there was a way to put limits on OR and Dir separately, so I could serve both until bandwidth runs out. I think the ideal situation would be a way to both set hard limits, or relative limits (ie, 90% OR/10% Dir or 9GB OR/1GB Dir).

@_subject: More important: Bridges or ORs 
I'm currently running my tor node as a bridge, and have been for a
couple of months now. Haven't seen much traffic, which I guess makes
sense. Which does the community think is more important right now,
running as a bridge or as a OR? I'm located geographically in the
Northeastern portion of the USA, if that makes any kind of difference.
