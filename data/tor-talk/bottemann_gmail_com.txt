@_subject: [tor-talk] "/var/run/tor does not exist", Tor won't start 
I created the /var/run/tor directory and
restarted Vidalia.  Tor still won't start.
The Vidalia log no longer complains about
the missing directory, but that
"Permissions on directory /var/run/tor
are too permissive."
What should the permissions be?

Vidalia (v0.2.14) reports Tor (v0.2.2.33) can't
create a socket because "/var/run/tor" does
not exist.
Tor cannot be started manually for same reason.
All this occurred after today's Ubuntu Lucid
software updates.
Google has been of little help, other than to
confirm others have had this problem in the
last week to ten days.
And haven't seen anything yet on tor-talk list.
