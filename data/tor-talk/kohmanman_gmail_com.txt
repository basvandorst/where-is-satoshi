@_subject: Tor with secure Gmail 
I am using Gmail at  with tor.
When I am at login, browser will state that the connection is only
partially secure, ie. some items (I do not know what) are not
encrypted. However, once I untor, I am able to get into the fully
secure Gmail login page.
I tried this for many times and got this result each time. As I live
in an unsafe country, I am worried my government is adding code to
network traffic to identify users.
Thanks in advance.
