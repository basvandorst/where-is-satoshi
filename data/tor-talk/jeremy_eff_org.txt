@_subject: [tor-talk] Double-checking a couple questions about node churn rate 
I have a couple questions which I could probably find the answer to on
my own by writing up some scripts and doing a little research, but I
figured I'd ask here first in case anyone already knows the answer and
can take 30 seconds to reply:
1. Does anyone have an idea of what the usual churn rate is for Tor
nodes? (I'm guessing fairly low for most nodes, but if anyone has even
rough numbers, that would help...)
2. How common is it for a node to change its exit policy and go from
being a relay-only node to an exit node (and vice versa)? If a node did
change, how quickly would that be reflected in Onionoo? (I'm guessing
the answers are rare and at most an hour after the change, respectively.)
I realize these are vague questions, so even
order-of-magnitude-rough-guess answers would be appreciated!

Thanks so much Karsten--this is awesome and exactly what I was looking for!

If anyone is curious, I went ahead and wrote a quick little Python
script that will analyze consensus files from
(To make life easier you have to flatten the extracted consensus files
into one directory instead of having them separated by different
directories for each day.) The script runs through them and finds the
number of nodes that have disappeared or changed their exit policy, and
writes the data to a csv file. (It's completely unoptimized and does no
error checking--it's definitely not production code.)
The script is attached, as well as the resulting csv file containing
data for September 2014. So how many nodes switch from being relays to
exits or vice versa?
The results show that on average, 0.003% of nodes switch from being
relay nodes to exit nodes in any given 1-hour period, and 0.002% switch
from being exit nodes to relay nodes.
Thanks to everyone for all their help!
