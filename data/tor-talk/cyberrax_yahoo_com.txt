I see one major problem with this: "legal" is a
constnantly changing, and quite widely interpreted,
definition. I see your point in tracking down
pedophiles and crackers, but what about those people
who use TOR to deliver sensitive information to the
world? So sensitive that it'd be considered treason by
the one or the other government? Tracking down the
leakers would be completelly leagal, if I'm not wrong
then in atleast some countries it's also legal to
execute them for this, but is that really something we
Are abusers really such a big problem? I see projects
like Wikileaks which show that TOR is put on use for
good, but I've yet hear that a verified claim that TOR
was used by some pedophile.
Personally I find, that if there's a possibility then
there will sooner or later be someone who'll take
advantage of it. Even if it's not neccessary or
allowed or, even, moral.

@_subject: Sending SIGHUP under Windows 
Hi! As I've gotten annoyed with Vidalia lately (which silently strips away several options I've manually added to TORRC, this behaviour has been noted in their bug-reporting system but, atleast currently, it's not been fixed) then I wondered if anyone can provide a working way to send SIGHUP (and possibly also SIGTERM) to Tor (which is running as a service) on Windows (specifically W2K) platform?
I've tried CygWin's KILL, but this fails with "couldn't open pid 708" message (708 being the Windows PID that 'ps -W' outputs). Tested the VBS script that was posted to the list some time ago, but that fails authentication (I've set up a password for Tor, perhaps if the script could be modified to send also the hash then it'd work?).
Any help would be appreciated.

The 12th week increase is likely due the protests in
Tibet. I recall that atleast one German news program
mentioned that the Chinese government is trying to
supress info flow to the outside world. If this is no
reason to set up TOR nodes then what is?   ;)

Click "start Tor" button, then Vidalia should connect to it. Unlike older versions newer ones don't try to detect Tor that's already running (I think this was even filed in as a bug, but the maintainers didn't see it that way).

@_subject: any middlemen seeing DoS currently? 
Could the "No current certificate known for authority ides; launching request." message that my client's been displaying every minute or so for the last 4 hours be related to that, or is my problem just a coincident?

What version are you using? Atleast 0.1.9 on Windows does have UPnP support, the "attempt to automatically configure port forwarding" on Sharing screen does just that - use UPnP to forward the configured or/dir ports.

It could instead be carried by websites. Vidalia already has pre-defined presets for easier setup of exit nodes (instant messaging, HTTP, etc), another preset wouldn't be hard to include. As for Tor's side - a default list already present in .TORRC doesn't sound bad. I think it'd help a lot if people knew that *by default* exit node configuration is set up for safe websites (but users are also encouraged to include other services to help the Tor network even more).

@_subject: perfect-privacy.com, Family specifications, etc. 
For most users it would suffice if all PerfectPrivacy nodes would loose their Guard flag (which for those who haven't explicitly set "UseEntryGuards 0" in their TORRC would mean that PerfectPrivacy servers would act the way they seems to be set up - as middle-relays).
As far as I can tell the main problem are the German relays which list other family members as PPrivGermanyX, while the servers themselves use the names PPrivComGermanyX. So it would be enough if servers PPrivComGermany2 - PPrivComGermany5 would become invalid.
The exact definition of "family" seems somewhat foggy in the documentation. The Tor manual says "controlled or administered by a group or organization identical or? similar to that of the other servers" which to me reads "is run by the same people", while the TorFAQ starts with "don't run more than a few dozen on the same network" which seems to indicate that the physical network is what defines a family (which seems to be how the PerfectPiracy folks are defining it). It's only the last line of that section which says "You should set MyFamily if you have administrative control of the computers or of their network". Seems like an optional thing to me rather than a Personally I have mixed feelings about disabling a whole node-family just to send a message. Sure, it'll probably work and definitely would help Tor's security, but it'd also be bad for the networks throughput and punish the relay operators for something that doesn't seem to have been explicitly said out loud.

@_subject: [tor-talk] New idea for bypassing censorship 
Any half-way decent external proxy-program, or switcher inside the browser, will do basically that. For Firefox there's FoxyProxy, which doesn't detect or avoid warning.go.kr, but allows you to specify sites (or groups of sites) which should be accessed through proxies. You simply specify that the blocked sites ought to be loaded through your Tor, not directly. Ain't automatic, but works.
