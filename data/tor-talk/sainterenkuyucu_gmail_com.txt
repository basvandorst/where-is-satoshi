@_subject: [tor-talk] Resources about TOR proctocol 
Hello everbody.
I am looking for resources about TOR's proctocol.
Forexample: resolving onion extension , How can TOR find nodes etc.
I am trying code a network like TOR in Java.
I searched on google , readed pdf files. But I can't work on tor source
codes because written in C.
PDF files aren't enough. If there documents which explains detailed TOR I
want to read them.
Can you help me?
