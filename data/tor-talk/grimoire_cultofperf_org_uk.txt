@_subject: first hop to entry node, encrypted? sorry for trivial question 
There is often some confusion as to the definition of an "entry node".
The user runs a local Tor proxy, normally on the same machine as their
web browser / IM client. Connections between client applications and
this local Tor are *not* encrypted.
However, this local proxy is not the "entry node" in Tor terms. The
entry node is the first hop in the chain of *public* Tor servers.
Traffic between your local Tor proxy and the entry node *is* encrypted,
and that's the bit which goes across your ISP's network.

@_subject: Spam over Tor 
What exactly is happening? Somebody is using your Tor exit node to
access a website (yahoo mail) and using that to send spam? And this is
being traced back to you by the spam being traced back to Yahoo, and
Yahoo checking their webmail logs and finding your exit node's IP?
One thing you *could* do is block Yahoo! mail in your server's exit
policy, though it sounds to me like this is Yahoo!'s problem for
allowing spam rather than yours...

I'm personally surprised that ISPs (and other companies) aren't offering
VPN services to avoid wifi hijacking.

@_subject: Filtering traffic from your node - for exit points 
There's a huge difference between logging and making yourself liable for
"illegal" content.
Given what's at stake, the "sickos" viewing this "illegal" and "immoral"
material are likely to suffer a little inconvenience - after all,
they're already using Tor.
Meanwhile, you're providing the same inconvenience to "legitimate"
viewers of "legal" and "moral" content, who may be less technically
adept, encouraging them to avoid Tor and risk prosecution for their
"legitimate" activities in their "oppressive" countries.
I don't think it's right for Tor to break other people's connections, or
to behave differently. We've had issues in the past discussed on this
list where people have been running Tor exits using alternate DNS
networks, or on ISPs which redirect NXDOMAINs to holding pages.
As others have mentioned, if it were possible for your Tor node to
advertise what it was blocking, so users' connections could
automatically route around your exit node if they're going to somewhere
your filter deems inappropriate, it'd be less of a concern for the
network overall.
However, you'd then have the problem that the exit nodes whose operators
choose not to attempt to filter "illegal" content will end up routing
proportionally more traffic, which makes balancing the network harder.

@_subject: A Tor Typo 
Colour me an anally-retentive English language Nazi of the British
variety, but even if it is the first letter in a word that matters, then
the correct article is still "an", in the style of "an hotel" and all
other words that begin with the letter "h".

Bear in mind that there are juristictions where, as soon as you begin to
filter content, you become liable for all the false negatives.

This isn't anything I'm aware of in UK law, and I'm pretty sure I would
have heard about it if it were.
The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) 2000 details the
powers the police have to demand decrypts and keys. You can read more
about it at

Yes, but that's not what the original poster asked:
UK law does not oblige you to hand over your private keys to the authorities as soon as you use GnuPG or PGP.

@_subject: Not using slow circuits (was Re: Tor slow no matter what I do.) 
In parts of the world that may be feasible. Certainly here in the UK the
standard broadband product is 64KB downstream, 32KB upstream, which
means that a Tor server eats over half your upstream bandwidth. Most
products which offer greater downstreams only have 16KB upstreams, not
enough to meet Tor's minimum requirements.
By increasing the minimum requirement for a Tor node, you reduce the
geographical distribution of Tor nodes, making cross-jurisdiction
routing more unlikely; it would be better to investigate ways to reduce
traffic overhead (if this is possible) to allow more people to run Tor

There are many GNU/Linux distributions. If you're a newcomer to
GNU/Linux, I'd advise starting with Debian, available from
 due to its excellent stability and support. But
everyone will have their own opinions on this; you might want to look at
 for an overview of different distributions.

@_subject: OnionCat -- An IP-Transparent TOR Hidden Service Connector 
If you are connecting using NX, the only port you need to access is SSH
- all NX traffic is tunneled over that. Of course, you should never use
the default NX SSH keys over the Internet.
You should be able to connect to your machine over SSH via Tor, and then
connect out from that machine normally.
