Hey Wim,
Did you tried selecting TBBs firefox.exe manually via 'Open with' while right-clicking an html file?
Works like a charm on my 7x64

Hey Wim,
When talking about TBB the Tor Browser Bundle is meant. (Including vidalia and little-t-tor; You are calling it just Tor Browser but it's the same thing)
TBB is built using the Firefox Kernel with some additions/extensions and mostly just a secure/careful configuration. So if you are using TBB / the Tor Browser you are always using Firefox.
You can manually by following this guide on Option 2. Here you need to select the path to your firefox.exe (usually in the "Tor Browser" Folder) manually. Please let us know if this helped,

Hey Wim,
This option should exist when there are several programs that can handle a file. Could you try this by just opening the editor and save the empty file with the extension .html.
This behaviour is fairly strange and new to me so I will check on this tomorrow when I have a Windows 10 machine around
Best wishes

Hey Said,
You were injected by a virus called 'ransomware'. This software has encrypted your data using a private key which is only available through the attacker. Despite that you shouldn't pay money to anybody for decrypting your files or making the private key available to you. There are several methods available to 'clean' your computer, just google for 'CTB removal' but I recommend you to setup your computer with a clean and fresh install of your OS and restore your data from a backup.
The ransomware/ virus is not affiliated with or made by the Tor Project in any way. Kleft

Hey there,
Boards with illegal content like crimenetwork.biz are using cloudflare too. You can't really access sites with cloudflare's security-settings switched to "very secure" if you don't enable JavaScript. I better don't think about what Scripts they will run. It's useful for automated downloads eg with an uploaded.to free-accounts. (This is the only website I remember right now, but there are many other services require the user to enter captchas to get some content.)

Hallo Hartmut,
i think this is an error of the ARD-mediathek. Their website checks via JavaScript which browser you are using and if it is html5 compatible and they maybe just forgot to mark the linux-versions of firefox as html5-ready.
You could try changing the submitted browser version via the user-agent switcher (1). Simply paste any newer / common browser there e.g. "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.11; rv:41.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/41.0". You should get an html5 video stream without the need of adobes flash then.

Hey Eren,
There is already a Java client for connecting to the Tor network
You may want to have a look if that fit your needs:

Hash: SHA512
I'm not actually sure but I think this behavior results from one of the
Tor security features. It's about to minimize the risk of using
malformed entries cause choosing only a few random nodes as entry guards
seems to be still better than a random selection with every new circuit.
Please see  for
further details.
