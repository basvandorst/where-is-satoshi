@_subject: [tor-talk] help!! 
My university has blocked many sites that i think ought not to be blocked..
This made me install the tor.... At first it worked and would easily open the blocked sites but then after 2 days the tor would not connect to its server as if the tor itself has been blocked... Please help me out of this problem.
