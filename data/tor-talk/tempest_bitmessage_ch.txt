they aren't flimy at all. read the filed criminal complaints that came
out of maryland and new york. just as in the harvard case, standard
police work led to the arrests of people. if you are using tor, but
happen to give your home address to a law enforcement agent, and you
also happen to know the physical location of a server, or servers,
connected to acriminl enterprise, tor won't do you any good. if people
who you work with connect to those servers without using tor, tor does
them no good.
in the harvard incident, if you use an email provider that appends a
personal ip address as an x-header in the outgoing message, which can be
easily distinguished as a tor exit node by using a common search engine,
if you fit a common investigatory profile that would have a motive to
issue a bomb threat (which students and employees would certainly fall
into), it is hardly surprising that anyone who identifiably connected to
the tor network on the harvard campus would be interviewed.
this really should not be spun as bad pr for tor. rather, it proves that
tor, in and of itself, is not something that can absolutely shield
criminals from discovery and prosecution. the people opposed to tor
constantly state the opposite, that tor makes it impossible for law
enforcement to catch criminals. yet, we now have multiple very public
examples of how good and standard detective work can prevail.

"rtfm" applies since info on torproject.org, in addition to other
sources, mentions the threats you are concerned about in regards to
identity correlation. some people will read it. some won't. it should
not take a genius to understand that signing in to any service with
identifying credentials for the purpose of net connectivity is not the
smartest of methods if your networking activity could result in you
being prosecuted. i'm not implying i'm against any steps to make the
process more user friendly. but, in this example of the alleged bomber,
it just doesn't really apply. this is someone who acted in haste without
taking the time to rtfm. as hard as you may try, you cannot protect

@_subject: [tor-talk] Harvard student used Tor to send bomb threats, 
tor at bitmessage.ch:
the fundamental problem here is that this is not a technological issue.
it's a user issue that will, in the end, breakdown at the "rtfm" point.
currently, the tor browser bundle has a link on the opening page which
documents the standard tips on remaining anonymous. outside of writing
more detailed instructions on identity correlation and linking them in
the basic instructions, there isn't much more that can be done outside
of discovering a technological means that makes connecting to the tor
network itself invisible.
the more you look at the circumstances involved, the less likely that
is. the man who made the threat was using tor for offensive, rather than
defensive, purposes. additionally, he was engaging in an offensive
operation against an entity that he was personally connected to. for
people looking to circumvent censorship, it is unlikely that they will
be viewing any servers run by their respective oppressors while using
the tor network. rather, they'll most likely be communicating with
servers that are not run by their respective oppressors and, instead,
are blocked by them. completely different scenarios.
it's there. maybe the harvard student would have been smart enough to
figure out what it meant. maybe he wouldn't. or, like so many others,
maybe he would have decided to role the dice anyways under the
assumption that capture was unlikely. without the tor project
documenting every possible way someone may get caught through their
various uses of tor, i'm hard pressed to think of a solution to te
problem posed by ignorant users.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Benefits of Running TBB in a VM? 
Bobby Brewster:
point 1 makes sense. it's not bullet proof. but, unless you are dealing
with malware that is designed to break out of the restrictions imposed
by a vm, you have spared yourself a headache. you can further mitigate
against such common malware risks by using a system of snapshots. while
not as ideal as a "live" configuration, after you set up your virtual
machine for use, you can make a snapshot of it and, after each completed
session, restore your vm from the snapshot. unless you received malware
designed to exploit a vm, this will result in the malware being gone the
next time you use the vm as well.
point 2 does not work.  any malware that phones home will show your ip
address in that configuration.  however, if you use something like
whonix, where you have a gateway vm that pushes all of your workstation
vm traffic through tor, you have another layer of protection against
malware with phone home capabilities.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Benefits of Running TBB in a VM? 
Bobby Brewster:
if your non-VM host system has been compromised, there is absolutely no
notable advantage to using a vm.  your vm will be affected by the
malware that sits on the host system.  however, if you use a vm and the
vm gets infected by malware, you have an extra layer of protection
against the malware infecting your host system. thus, with the snapshot
method i described, you can effectively wipe away malware in certain
from an anonymity standpoint, whether running from your host or from a
vm, malware with a phone home system has a greater chance of
successfully identifying you than if you used a system like whonix.
for anonymity, it doesn't make any difference. you're better off running
it as an "internal network" and using an additional vm as a gateway that
has rules to push all traffic through the tor network.

low latency does not need to be sacrificed. a different opsec game needs
to be played if you have information that a global adversary would care
to prosecute you for. i personally don't care for two-bit criminals. but
people who have evidence of crimes by global adversaries? they need to
be able to learn how to share evidence without fear of prosecution. tor
alone won't do that, and the tor project has never claimed otherwise,

despite pressure from the us federal government, which pulled out every

refused to accept it and thought on a global level to support the

this is truly a monumental moment. libraries in the usa have often been
the target of hostile actions that threaten the first amendment of the
us constitution and the privacy rights of people. through a long string
of legal battles, libraries have earned an extraordinary position that
provides them with the ability to offer services that could land other
people in significant legal battles which become both legally and
politically difficult to close down.

the problem with such a solution is that it will be overly complex for

when it comes to creating an account.  plus, without taking steps with a

forwarding it to a sip provider would likely result in them breaking
their anonymity.
i'm not concerned for my account. using a variation on the method

to be either entirely dishonest spin at worst, or proof of a rushed
security model with an ignorant understanding of its implications at
best.  for the users i've communicated with since i brought this up who
have been experiencing issues, they've simply been using the tor browser
to connect to twitter and post. twitter is apparently viewing this as
activity which is similar to a spambot. since they told

need to continue working on this, as it is still broken.

i whole heartedly agree and i am considering including diaspora
instructions in a guide i work on in the near future. i am entirely
sympathetic to twitter's frustration with bots that use tor for purposes
that conflict with their terms of service. however, their recent
approach to dealing with that is simply ensnaring too many users who,
upon a cursory glance at their time line, are clearly not bots. rather,
they are simply using tor, which twitter can distinguish by the
connection logs. thus, i am increasingly unsatisfied with twitter's
response that they "aren't targeting tor users." while this may have a
modicum of truth to it, they clearly aren't doing enough to protect tor
users either, and have adopted a solution that uses a nuclear bomb,
rather than a fly swatter, to deal with spambots. the fact remains that
their recent changes in security procedures have made it increasingly
difficult for average tor users to maintain a presence on twitter.
meanwhile, some diaspora pods are going as far as offering onion
services. twitter needs to get its act together since, over the past 37
days, the shortest response time i've had for their mistaken security
protocol took 12 hours. the longest took 2 weeks, where twitter support
had simply given up on responding to me and i sorted it by changing an

while i'm entirely sympathetic to the "ease of use argument, i'd also
like to see setups like whonix mentioned. perhaps i'll give it a try
myself. for basic threat scenarios, it should be able to do a
comparison table on a web pageof what tor based tools are out there
and may be more desirable than just the browser (tails, whonix,
qubes+whonix, etc.).
as for the point about the mum, there is a long guide up at

users towards a process of installing debian and whonix. it is
certainly not a "fast" process and is more complex than tbb alone.
However, if one's mum is willing to invest the time, they'll more than
likely install the system successfully.
it doesn't have to be "all of them." but a few more details based on
experiences common enough to have been regularly covered by the media
certainly would not hurt.
fairly simple actually. it's for anonymity focussed users who want to
add extra layers of protection against ip leaks while moderately
shrinking the attack surface for a persistent malware infection (if
configured correctly).  if one is simply using the browser to get
around a firewall and doesn't need the anonymity, probably not needed.

it's classic fed jacketing which, unfortunately, is an all too common
response that need not be humored in such circumstances.
there is no reason to split up and parse my statement. another common
fallacy that is employed against people who speak up, or listen to
those who speak up, is "you have found x guilty before he has been
proven as such and, thus, are violating x's due process rights." if
you use the legal term of "due process," then my initial response is
absolutely on point. "that rule only applies in a court of law. if you
steal from me and are never taken to court, it's not a violation of
"due process" if i call you a thief, nor is it defamation."
therefore, when a direct implication of a legal term used in a fallacy
that references the finding of guilt, such a fallacy should not be
tolerated in the context, since this list is not a court of law.
