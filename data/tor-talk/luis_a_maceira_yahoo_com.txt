@_subject: Firefox,Torbutton leaks real IP Address. 
The combination Firefox-3.0.3(in fact,Iceweasel-3.0.3),Torbutton-1.2.0 leaks my real IPaddress.This happens BETWEEN when I initiate Tor-0.2.0.31 with the bash command /usr/local/tor/bin/tor and the moment when Tor effectively establishes a connection-circuit.This can be 60 seconds or more,and if in between we connect to the Internet withFirefox-Torbutton the real IP address is used(even with torbutton running-green)I tested with  and others.My fear is if the same could happen when Tor changes circuit by ten-ten minutes or so,when leaves the previous circuit to the next one.(what happens in the transition moments).I did not test that situation.? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

@_subject: Firefox,Torbutton leaks real IP Address. 
I can't reproduce the event of leakage the real IP address within the initial period of establishing the first circuit.I have tried with the same settings: Firefox,Torbutton,Privoxy
but now Firefox waits the necessary period till establishement of the circuit,only then,the page  etc. is displayed,with the IP address of the Tor exit node.So,I am considering the hypothesis that in the two times I noticed the leakage of the real IP address,was not my IP address,but the IP address of an exit node in my country (same flag) within the range of dynamic IP addresses of my DSL provider(and I wrongly thought it was mine).Anyway,now I tested with tor-0.2.0.32(compiled from source) and Iceweasel-3.0.4.(more recent versions).When I noticed the "leakage"(perhaps
it was not) I verified that the torbutton was green and privoxy was setup(as always is).

I am not able to use the Tor Network,I use Debian

above everytime,and not once I could use Tor.
So I suspect that my ISP blocks Tor.Looking at the
above logs can someone tell me what is the problem?
Note:I use tor-button with

showmyip.com the IP is my ISP IP.Now in torrc I
determine entrynodes and exitnodes verified previously

This is what I get when I try to connect with my
webbrowser to  ancient client
of my DSL ISP says in a newsgroup that right before
he left this ISP was blocking proxy ports 80 and 8080
and maybe this is a reason for Tor not effective to
other user that was complaining about it,and that he
should use foxyproxy to avoid this issue.
How do I know if my ISP is blocking Tor and is
the configuration of foxyproxy a good idea,but
the configuration of privoxy should not be sufficient?

@_subject: Blocked by my ISP?-Solved.But Additional Question. 
The communication between Privoxy and Tor was not
set up correctly in the configuration files,it is OK now.Additionaly some things in the logs were
due to entrynodes and exitnodes restrict options
in my torrc.Anyway I downloaded and compiled the
most recent Tor which is run now from /usr/local/
when I need,and not when the computer boots(the
default in debian). tells me that everything is OK.
The question: can I use the FQDN or IP preferably,
instead of nicknames,in torrc entrynodes,exclude
nodes,exitnodes options?I have read something
lately about the functioning of the Tor system,
and it seems the directory servers/client initial
dialog to determine the running nodes is protected
by strong authentication,but when I access
a listing of running nodes(by country,etc.)
using  example) with a
webbrowser,how do I have assurance that the
nicknames correspond to the real IP address?
Does Tor check based on the strong authenticated
listing received upon initial dialog with the
directory servers the authenticity of the pairs
nicknames/computers we could set up in exitnodes etc.
of torrc?
                 Thanks.

The steps to configure Filezilla 3.x to use Tor in  Toryfing apps...seem not correct as I can't find under Settings... the Generic Proxy to point to 127.0.0.1port 9050.Only an ftp proxy appears under Settings...,which by the way should not beused,as is written there.Are there other ways to configure Filezilla 3.x,or is this something specific to this 3.0.11,and in other 3.x versions Generic Proxy appears under Settings...

The well-known TLS renegotiating error which the tor-0.2.1.21 version was supposed to address persists on FreeBSD-8.0 updated as of today.The unstable version (0.2.2.6) same thing the error persists (On Linux and using tor-0.2.2.6 the error does not exist -I had this error only on Debian Testing and OpenSuSE)-.So,it seems to be a FreeBSD issue,more specifically after a recent FreeBSD update(when I no more could use tor).

I built/installed openssl-0.9.8l on /usr/local/ssl/ ,the tor configure script when run recognize according the messages
this openssl (I used the configure option --with-openssl-dir=/usr/local/ssl/lib,but in fact the resulting tor binary is
linked to the system openssl libraries (verified with ldd) ,then the resulting TLS renegotiating error. How can I force tor to be linked to openssl on /usr/local/ssl/ instead of the system openssl? The option
--with-openssl-dir=/usr/local/ssl/lib does not work.It seems to work according to configure messages,but in fact
it is linked to the system openssl.

My first time using FreeBSD is with this 8.0-RELEASE,so I am quite new with it.Ionly have on my system pre-compiled binaries I installed with pkg_add.I havenever used the ports system,I have had the idea that it is something comparableto sources/binaries on Linux distros using the sources gives exactly the samebinaries(installs exactly on the same directories).Here,I used a method I haveused on Linux distros for some software (binaries linked with specific librarieson specific directories,not to system libraries),I got the pristine sources from compiled and installed them,now I need to link them to the torbinary.If a straightforward method does exist I appreciate you post a link to it.

@_subject: Firefox,FireFTP,FTP etc. downloads anonymity. 
When we read the Tor FAQs related to anonymity of ftp tranfers there are several questions that come to mind:
1)Is the most recent Filezilla really secure/tested so we can trust the anonymity it provides through Tor?(something close to Firefox/Privoxy/Torbutton?)
2)Using Firefox 3.6.12 and FireFTP 1.0.9(most recent versions) downloading from Adobe(Flash Player,Adobe Reader,for example) I receive a warning that an external application is being launched -accept or reject-,is this app FireFTP?Is this warning coming from Torbutton?Does FireFTP 1.0.9 still leak DNS requests?
3)When it comes to ftp through Tor and reading the Tor FAQs it seems the better solution is 3proxy,however this software is not integrated on the major (any?)linux distributions and downloading directly it must be done from a russian website.The guys behind 3proxy can be really trustworthy but I do not feel specially comfortable using the software.

I have faced several websites that exclude Tor users from Sign Up with them,even configuring torrc to go through low speed ExitNodes(not associated with spam) it is not possible.They must be using TorDNSEL,or so,and receiving real time csv lists of ExitNodes and that way it is easy to exclude tor users.So,I have not figured out,so far,what is the trick to surpass this.For example,can we obtain a list of very fresh ExitNodes not yet in the csv files lists of ExitNodes? And that way can go under the radar?

Tor works at first sight normally,but is it really secure?
