Is it possible to point easily to the work required (bugs, wiki)? I
have seen this "iceweasel-src" solution mentioned before, but it's not
clear to me what this entails. I would love to see "apt-get install
tor-browser" or similar work...perhaps I may contribute here.

@_subject: [tor-talk] carml: tasty treats from your Tor 
I've got a first super-alpha release of this thing that's been sitting
around for a while. Turns out "sanitize a bit" turns into "refactor some
things" and so forth...
Anyway, carml does various command-line things with Tor and I thought it
might be useful to others (plays nicely with grep, pipes, etc).
I would really love feedback on whether the "downloadbundle" command is
doing the right thing with certificate-checks.
You can "pip install carml" to try it out. Recommend doing this in a
   virtualenv trycarml
   ./trycarml/bin/pip install carml
   ./trycarml/bin/carml help
To check signatures first, instead download the WHL file and associated
signature from PyPI, gpg --verify it and then replace "install carml"
with "install path/to/.whl" above.
Some other things to try:
   carml downloadbundle --extract --system-keyring
   echo "hello darkweb" | carml pastebin
wait for a new consensus to be published, dump it and exit:
   carml events --once NEWCONSENSUS
Currently, the defaults work with a system Tor (i.e. localhost port
9051). Probably I'll change this to be TBB defaults. To connect to a Tor
Browser Bundle instance, do this:
   carml --connect tcp:localhost:9151 monitor
It is written using Twisted and txtorcon.

@_subject: [tor-talk] carml 0.0.6 + PyPI 
There were some problems with PyPI packaging and carml.
Lucky for you all, I now know waaay more than I did about setuptools and
so carml 0.0.6 should be a "pip install carml" away.
To use "carml downloadbundle" you need to "pip install txsocksx" as
well. On Debian:
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev build-essential python-pip python-virtualenv
cd /tmp
virtualenv funtimes
./funtimes/bin/pip install carml txsocksx
./funtimes/bin/carml downloadbundle

FWIW, "carml pastebin" does a non-encrypted [*] version of these, on
ephemeral (or not if you save the keys) hidden services.
For example, "cat /some/file | carml pastebin" will set up a new
hidden-service for you with /some/file being served out of it. Support
for stealth-authenticated hidden-services is on its way, see this
   You'd likely want correct MIME-types for the documents/images I guess,
which I don't think will work correctly at the moment. Pull-requests
always welcome, of course :)
[*] The adventurous can try the stealth-auth version, but you need a
particular branch of txtorcon for at least the "carml copybin" side to
work properly.

It seems there's "some" interest in upgrading TorFlow? I can't in good
conscience say that -- without funding -- I alone can replace it -- but
I do have an out-of-date txtorcon exit-relay scanning system that could
*become* a "next gen" torflow.

versed in event-based programming (ideally Twisted, but asyncio,
node.js, boost's asio or others are great too).
IMO, the best thing would be for authority operators to enumerate on a
wiki page or ticket a) their requirements and b) their issues with
TorFlow. Or, I guess, c) torflow is amazing and meejah has the wrong
impression :)

My usual method of connecting to OFTC via Tor is "really hope the exit I

However, this "strategy" has been failing for weeks. Is there a better
way to connect? I'm using SSL and authorizing via SASL.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and Google error / CAPTCHAs. 
I think it's kind of dangerous to assume whole classes of information
will *never* be interesting -- if you don't anonymize at the source,
they'll be recorded forever (approximately).
Like, maybe we invent AI in 20 years that looks back at your Netflix
viewing habits and concludes all those cat movies put you at too high a
risk of owning a (now illegal) cat...
But, for a practical non-future-speculative use-case: what if you're
travelling but don't want Teh Internets to know that? Then you might
want to do seemingly "non-anonymous" things like log into GitHub or
gmail or facebook or whatever over .
I don't know how, but it would also be nice if "we" could pressure
companies like Netflix to fund / participate in research allowing them
to get the feature (e.g. relevant suggestions) while preserving at least
some anonymity (i.e. not having a database of every show everyone has
ever watched).
p.s. Also practically speaking: I'm not suggesting everone start
streaming Netflix over Tor ... but I *am* suggesting you should use
GitHub etc over Tor ;)
p.p.s gmail doesn't deal well with Tor (looks like maybe some websocket
connections start failing). On the other hand, github and slack deal
very well. IME.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and Google error / CAPTCHAs. 
A lot of it is just by accident, too, I think: many Cloudflare customers
seem not to know that they have to "do something" (change an option) to
not by default "block" Tor users (i.e. give them a CAPTCHA).
...and e.g. at shared hosting or similar companies, individual web sites
likely have no idea that they are blocking Tor users (i.e. if the hoster
decided to block Tor, for whatever reason).
So often a friendly note saying "did you know you're disallowing Tor
users?" goes a long way...
There is a DNS-based system for this already, from Tor Project. But I
guess you mean making this work for "internal" systems at whatever

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor official list of new .onion addresses? 
v3 onions get rid of this enumeration attack entirely. They can be used
now with a recent Tor.
A wider point here is that "enumerate all .onions" *is* considered an
attack on the Tor network, so any "list of onion addresses" would have
to be strictly opt-in.
Anyone can therefore offer such a service (and people have over the
years done just that).

If you're comfortable with the command-line, you could try "carml":
   The command you probably want is "carml monitor". You can create and
destroy circuits and streams with "carml circ" and "carm stream"

@_subject: [tor-talk] Onion website on "usual" server 
The best solution to prevent this accident is to have the onion site
listening on a Unix socket, and set up the Onion service in Tor to
direct to that.
nginx supports HTTP over unix sockets (as does my favourite, Twisted Web
if you're fine with Python -- which also can be used easily with Tor via
my library txtorcon).

If you like the command-land, you can try "carml". You'd want "carml
monitor" or "carml circ --list", see:
   You could also use this to play with the "raw" control-port commands
without writing a whole control-port client first, e.g.:
   carml cmd "GETINFO info/names"
   carml cmd "GETINFO entry-guards"
