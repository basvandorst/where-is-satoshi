Hash: SHA1
For what it's worth:
I've been running the tor service with a regular user account on XP
Pro, and have a data directory with the keys and cached directory
encrypted using xp EFS to the account running the tor service (as
well as my own account for convienience).  Just had to give the user
account "Log on as a service" rights.
Is running it as LocalService better?  I also had concern with the
service running under the System account, and want to give the
account running the tor service as little permission as possible,
even sandbox it to just the tor directory if possible.

It certainly isn't a totally secure solution, I was just doing that in
reference to J. Random User's ability to get the keys (either remotely or
locally).  Of course locks on doors are only to keep the honest people out.
OK, just did that, and it still runs, thanks!
I think merging Matt's patch is definitely a good idea for the next release,
letting it run as LocalService by default, and the error message thing is an
improvement over having to run "sc query" every time...

@_subject: privoxy/firefox 
I have FF 1.0.6 stable, and it does do it's own DNS lookups when using
socks5 to tor.  There are no DNS leaks that I have found using privoxy and
tor, unless you have it using OCSP, in which case it does a dns lookup for,
say, ocsp.verisign.com, and then it seems to do an regular http ocsp check,
bypassing the proxy settings.  I assume that the certificate being checked
could be identified by that traffic, thus revealing the ssl site you are
browsing to through tor.  A lot of the plugins, such as the "ShowIP" plugin
also cause DNS leaks, plus, with geolocation and akamai servers, the ip
shown by showip may not be the ip used by whatever tor server you exited

I previously disabled port 80 exits because my AV program was doing some
"filtering" of the connections to http, as well as logging the connections
(even ones that were other people's exiting my tor node).  I've figured out
how to turn off cookie and javascript/activex filtering portion of my AV
program (as well as the connection logging), but the other thing that was
happening is that it was pulling any viruses or malicious scripting out of
the connection also.
Does a tor node write any of the connections it is relaying to temp files
ever?  If I can verify that turning off the privacy portion of my AV program
will also prevent any other sniffing or altering of the stream, then I will
open up port 80 again.

Hello Matt,
Somehow,  I  don't think China will kindly look upon those running Tor

I don't think refusing to do business with them would be a better thing than
to "comply with local government laws".  It certainly wouldn't put the
people of China in a better position than they are now, even with the
compromises, I think it would put them in a position similar to Cuban
citizens - stuck with nothing but old technology, with even less access to
any part of the internet (the Cuban anology is very loose, I was thinking of
all the old 1950-something Chevys that they drive), because, as you say, any

The router is "Elysium", and never mind the message, I was thinking of the

No traffic coming through yet, but I think as everyone's cached-routers get
updated it should pick up.  My log had said that the ip flapped a couple of
times and would ignore it for now, so I think the problem was that the old
ip was the one in the directory and it never got updated until a few minutes
ago - I've just never had it take so long to get back in sync with everyone
else when I've changed ips deliberately.
As for the certificate problem (with web browsers) both opera and firefox

Some time ago our security regulars broke down the logistics behind
Tor, an anonymity tool from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It was
designed for whistle-blowers, political dissidents, researchers, and
others concerned about exchanging information without authoritarian
backlash. Sadly network performance is being jeopardized by
file-traders looking to evade the RIAA.
File traders have been reconfiguring their Bit Torrent clients to take
advantage of the network. Unfortunately the Tor network wasn't
designed with high volume porn transfer in mind, so the activity is
slowing it down to a crawl. The likely result will be the EFF running
against the grain of their mandate, and restricting network use.

This is the sixth development snapshot for the 0.1.1.x series. It
fixes some bugs in 0.1.1.5-alpha, and adds new features including exit
enclaves, improved hidden service speed, remote reachability detection
by the dirservers, fixes to let the Tor network bootstrap again, and a
start on the new directory design.
Changes in version 0.1.1.6-alpha - 2005-09-09
  o Fixes on 0.1.1.5-alpha:
    - We broke fascistfirewall in 0.1.1.5-alpha. Oops.
    - Fix segfault in unit tests in 0.1.1.5-alpha. Oops.
    - Fix bug with tor_memmem finding a match at the end of the string.
    - Make unit tests run without segfaulting.
    - Resolve some solaris x86 compile warnings.
    - Handle duplicate lines in approved-routers files without warning.
    - Fix bug where as soon as a server refused any requests due to his
      exit policy (e.g. when we ask for localhost and he tells us that's
      127.0.0.1 and he won't do it), we decided he wasn't obeying his
      exit policy using him for any exits.
    - Only do openssl hardware accelerator stuff if openssl version is
      at least 0.9.7.
  o New controller features/fixes:
    - Add a "RESETCONF" command so you can set config options like
      AllowUnverifiedNodes and LongLivedPorts to "". Also, if you give
      a config option in the torrc with no value, then it clears it
      entirely (rather than setting it to its default).
    - Add a "GETINFO config-file" to tell us where torrc is.
    - Avoid sending blank lines when GETINFO replies should be empty.
    - Add a QUIT command for the controller (for using it manually).
    - Fix a bug in SAVECONF that was adding default dirservers and
      other redundant entries to the torrc file.
  o Start on the new directory design:
    - Generate, publish, cache, serve new network-status format.
    - Publish individual descriptors (by fingerprint, by "all", and by
      "tell me yours").
    - Publish client and server recommended versions separately.
    - Allow tor_gzip_uncompress() to handle multiple concatenated
      compressed strings. Serve compressed groups of router
      descriptors. The compression logic here could be more
      memory-efficient.
    - Distinguish v1 authorities (all currently trusted directories)
      from v2 authorities (all trusted directories).
    - Change DirServers config line to note which dirs are v1 authorities.
    - Add configuration option "V1AuthoritativeDirectory 1" which
      moria1, moria2, and tor26 should set.
    - Remove option when getting directory cache to see whether they
      support running-routers; they all do now. Replace it with one
      to see whether caches support v2 stuff.
  o New features:
    - Dirservers now do their own external reachability testing of each
      Tor server, and only list them as running if they've been found to
      be reachable. We also send back warnings to the server's logs if
      it uploads a descriptor that we already believe is unreachable.
    - Implement exit enclaves: if we know an IP address for the
      destination, and there's a running Tor server at that address
      which allows exit to the destination, then extend the circuit to
      that exit first. This provides end-to-end encryption and end-to-end
      authentication. Also, if the user wants a .exit address or enclave,
      use 4 hops rather than 3, and cannibalize a general circ for it
      if you can.
    - Permit transitioning from ORPort=0 to ORPort!=0, and back, from the
      controller. Also, rotate dns and cpu workers if the controller
      changes options that will affect them; and initialize the dns
      worker cache tree whether or not we start out as a server.
    - Only upload a new server descriptor when options change, 18
      hours have passed, uptime is reset, or bandwidth changes a lot.
    - Check [X-]Forwarded-For headers in HTTP requests when generating
      log messages. This lets people run dirservers (and caches) behind
      Apache but still know which IP addresses are causing warnings.
  o Config option changes:
    - Replace (Fascist)Firewall* config options with a new
      ReachableAddresses option that understands address policies.
      For example, "ReachableAddresses *:80,*:443"
    - Get rid of IgnoreVersion undocumented config option, and make us
      only warn, never exit, when we're running an obsolete version.
    - Make MonthlyAccountingStart config option truly obsolete now.
  o Fixes on 0.1.0.x:
    - Reject ports 465 and 587 in the default exit policy, since
      people have started using them for spam too.
    - It turns out we couldn't bootstrap a network since we added
      reachability detection in 0.1.0.1-rc. Good thing the Tor network
      has never gone down. Add an AssumeReachable config option to let
      servers and dirservers bootstrap. When we're trying to build a
      high-uptime or high-bandwidth circuit but there aren't enough
      suitable servers, try being less picky rather than simply failing.
    - Our logic to decide if the OR we connected to was the right guy
      was brittle and maybe open to a mitm for unverified routers.
    - We weren't cannibalizing circuits correctly for
      CIRCUIT_PURPOSE_C_ESTABLISH_REND and
      CIRCUIT_PURPOSE_S_ESTABLISH_INTRO, so we were being forced to
      build those from scratch. This should make hidden services faster.
    - Predict required circuits better, with an eye toward making hidden
      services faster on the service end.
    - Retry streams if the exit node sends back a 'misc' failure. This
      should result in fewer random failures. Also, after failing
      from resolve failed or misc, reset the num failures, so we give
      it a fair shake next time we try.
    - Clean up the rendezvous warn log msgs, and downgrade some to info.
    - Reduce severity on logs about dns worker spawning and culling.
    - When we're shutting down and we do something like try to post a
      server descriptor or rendezvous descriptor, don't complain that
      we seem to be unreachable. Of course we are, we're shutting down.
    - Add TTLs to RESOLVED, CONNECTED, and END_REASON_EXITPOLICY cells.
      We don't use them yet, but maybe one day our DNS resolver will be
      able to discover them.
    - Make ContactInfo mandatory for authoritative directory servers.
    - Require server descriptors to list IPv4 addresses -- hostnames
      are no longer allowed. This also fixes some potential security
      problems with people providing hostnames as their address and then
      preferentially resolving them to partition users.
    - Change log line for unreachability to explicitly suggest /etc/hosts
      as the culprit. Also make it clearer what IP address and ports we're
      testing for reachability.
    - Put quotes around user-supplied strings when logging so users are
      more likely to realize if they add bad characters (like quotes)
      to the torrc.
    - Let auth dir servers start without specifying an Address config
      option.
    - Make unit tests (and other invocations that aren't the real Tor)
      run without launching listeners, creating subdirectories, and so on.

You might want to verify that you're actually running .5, I had the same
problem and what I found was that the 0.1.1.6-alpha version was not getting
overwritten on the install for some reason, had to delete the .exe and .dll
files from the tor directory and then reinstall with 0.1.1.5-alpha for it to

@_subject: (FWD) port 587 
Gmail uses 25, 465 and 587 for SMTP, but since almost all isps block 25, 465
is the preferred SMTP with SSL for gmail, and 587 is the preferred SMTP with
TLS port (at least their help pages show 465 being used for outlook, which
doesn't support TLS, and 587 for netscape, which does support TLS.  I see no
reason to block those ports on my tor server, as pretty much every SMTP
server that uses these alternate ports requires authentication for SMTP,
which makes it difficult for someone to relay a load of spam through...
as a non-technical but paranoid Internet user, will the blocking of port
587 mess up Gmail? 587 is Gmail's SMTP port?

I'm getting this message on an xp box:
Sep 27 10:05:40.328 [Warn] connection_add(): Failing because we have 479
connections already. Please raise your ulimit -n.
I don't have a ulimit command, how do I solve this?

Thanks zinco.
I already had it patched to 16777214 connections (using xpantispy), turns
out I had "ConnLimit 512" in my torrc.

You could ask the Universidade Salgado de Oliveira (

has a web gateway on port 80...
