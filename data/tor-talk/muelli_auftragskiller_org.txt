@_subject: netscan from exit-node 
you are hosting by Hetzner, right? ;-) I get those automaticly generated
netscan-mails frequently. Some times they shut down the single Tor IP,
some time they shutdown the whole subnet. Depends on their mood (or
better: the mood of that IDS).
But the funny thing is, that they claim, the netscan abused a
*considerable* amount of ressources. So everytime I get this kind of
email, I calculate the amount of generated traffic and look how long the
scan lasted. Then I calculate the bandwidth and write them, that they
can't be serious and I demand the freeing of my IPs. Pretty simple
actually. To speed things up, you could write the "Rechenzentrum" your
server is located in.

@_subject: feedback about 0.2.0.6-alpha (r11277), traffic pattern and memory 
Just random thoughts: Do you have any BandwidthRate or BandwidthBurst
directives activated?

@_subject: German Tor-Exitnode mailinglist (exitnodes@lists.ccc.de) 
Dear Tor Folks,
I'd like to announce the existence of a dedicated mailinglist for german
Exit-Nodes. The CCC hosts a mailinglist whichs topic is the running of
Exit-Nodes in Germany. Everyone can subscribe the list by mailing to
exitnodes-subscribe at lists.ccc.de and write to the list by using
exitnodes at lists.ccc.de.
And again for the Krauts:
Der CCC betreibt eine Mailingliste, deren thematischer Schwerpunkt der
Betrieb von Exit-Nodes ist. Jeder kann die Liste mittels einer Mail an
exitnodes-subscribe at lists.ccc.de abbonieren und dann Mails an die Liste
exitnodes at lists.ccc.de schicken und mitdiskutieren. Die Mailingliste
lebt vom Mitmachen.
  Muelli (runs exitnodes on meatbox and serverbox)
