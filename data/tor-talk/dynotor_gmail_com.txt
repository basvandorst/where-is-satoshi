Interesting.  Olaf, I notice BT destinations seem mapped to nxdomain
or servfail.  Do you do this purposely to reduce abuse reports, or is
that done by your upstream provider?

Yup, BT=BitTorrent.    I don't know the sites by personal experience,
they just seemed to have BT like names.  Strange that there's such a
correspondence, but it isn't particular to your server -- I replicated
your results on a handful of tests, from both my exit and a local
non-tor IP.  Perhaps these are domains that have been shutdown via
court order or over zealous domain registrars?  Still, I'd think
people would stop trying to connect to them after a bit, but
trackedbyet.info is the 6th most popular DNS name, and it doesn't

I don't believe this is correct.  I think this means you're not an
exit node at all.
I suspect if you want your node to be an internal relay or have a
chance at being a guard and still relay some exit traffic, you'll have
more luck by running two tor instances, which could be on the same
box.  Put them in the same family (although I suppose tor will be
smart enough to keep them from being used on the same circuit anyway,
since they'll be on the same IP.)  Then you can adjust the bandwidth
for each instance to be the split you want.
If you're willing to be an exit node, however, you'll help the tor
network out most by doing 100% exit traffic.  That's because we're
currently constrained at the exits.  Also consider letting port 443
through too.  I do ports 80 and 443, and I haven't gotten an abuse
complaint yet.

Because he has reject *:* first, it won't even look at the commands
later.  First matching command wins.
Well, you definitely know better than I.  I had been under the (false)
impression that exit nodes were (at least mostly) used to exit.  Why
isn't that the case, given that we're constrained by exits?  Or am I
wrong about that too?

Yup, I did misread it.  Sorry!  Back to lurking now... :)
