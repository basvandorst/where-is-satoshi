@_subject: Tor does not support W95 
I cannot get the latest "stable" version to work under w95. The earlier
version works.
Do I have to deinstall the earlier version (I put the new version in
another directory).
First it told me I was missing a ws2 (winsock file) which I installed.
Now the dos window opens then closes with information I cannot see. I
logged the startup and I got: cannot start random no. generator. This
system has the latest DUN and winsock files now, but it still doesn't
work. I notice that the latest version says w98. Does this mean they
changed it so it will not support w95b? Any useful replies appreciated.

Thanks for the reply. Already gave you the error message below, but I
will try to do as you request. Latest version works fine under XP, but
my system is close, with the upgrades, to w98 and it does not work on my
system. Actually I am using Tor only for traffic that does not have to
be anonymized since the last version was supposedly anonymous and, it
turns out, after quite some time that it is not
anonymous and has security holes. All my other tcp programs are working
fine, including the old version of tor.

Ok, thanks William, I'll try it.
The system reports 95b which is osr2. Has the latest dun and wsock.
But could have some older files left over. Tell the truth I'm afraid
each time I upgrade cuz MS instructions are often wrong or their patches
just wreck the os. I'll be going to another os soon, thank God. Did I
ask b4 (i think i did) how do you set this list to digest? All the
messages are going to trash now,-theirs just too many of them. I thought
"set digest" would work, but it didn't. So I guess the old version was
two steps non anon, since the rsg was not working.

A few suggestions for the Tor gurus/developers.
Have some consideration for users that don't want to devote a large part
of their lives to working on Tor.
To wit:
You should make stronger warnings that Tor may not, as we have seen with
earlier versions (kinda like windoze) be anonymous after all.
Tell users that older OS's may not be supported as per the windows bug I
found (earlier versions work but do not warn of potential problems
Answer posters questions here, since you don't answer them publically as
per your absence in APAS.
As I predicted this effort is looking alot like the remailers out
there-poorly implemented and supported and geared only towards the
"elite (sure) inner circle".
I won't get your answers since no one answered my digest post and I
don't have time to look up why it is this list does not accept normal
set digest commands.

If I was in your position I might consider putting some bulk
demagnetizers near my hard drives with a panic switch, with backups to a
secure unknown location. Don't know how they work in Canada, but here in
the USA, they keep your equipment once they seize it and build a case
from your hard drives. Better yet increase your RAM and run everything
off a ram drive if possible. If you are already under surveillance, best
to seek legal advice now. Don't know if the Electronic Frontier
Foundation will help or not. You might also get advice on the usenet.
misc.legal, comp.legal(or similar). All depends on what statute and case
law is in Canada and whether or not you have access to good legal
representation. Sounds like they are getting ready to pounce and casing
your house.

What would have happened if you had not accepted their plea agreement?
Used to be here in the USA they had to bring u personally to court to
try and convict you.
Now they are convicting "in abstencia" for many crimes.
Because the courts, judges and prosecutors are too incompetent or busy,
they just convict you whether they give you your rights or not. The
government does what they can get away with and increasingly this means
they do not follow their own laws; constitutionaly restraints. Of course
when you get IDIOTS like G.W. Bush in Office and have an IDIOT populace
that votes for him, you deserve what you get, :-).
I thought Europe was better, but I guess not. Here in the U.S., we
frequently have people in the courts and police who are too stupid to
hold jobs in the private sector.
I think you did the right thing by ignoring their invitation. Do
everything you can to make their jobs more difficult, resist as far as
you are able.

There is this old tenet that frogs in water that is gradually heated
don't notice they are being boiled alive. This is what is happening to
America. The changes are not coming quickly or severely enough for our
apathetic, somewhat stupid populace to be alarmed enough to do
something. Either that and/or we are too cowardly to act. It is a pity
because America was founded on great principles, at least on paper. What
a shame we are allowing a corrupt government and political system to rob
us of our Constitution and our heritage. The internet is coming
increasingly under attack. How much longer will it take before the dark
forces that are stealing our rights away have total control over the
internet, our use of it and our privacy? I see alot of web pages and
rhetoric, but only a few are taking actions, which is understandable
considering the heavy handedness of our present governments towards
Citizens who go against the grain.
To Andrew, I am familiar with jury nullification and believe in it as
something that should be regularily implemented. The judges and
prosecutors of course HATE this and will do just about anything they can
to stop it's practice. Best course is to keep your mouth shut and
practice nullification without they're even knowing it. Difficult to do

I agree. But here is what one judge in Colorado did to a juror who told
others about nullification:
She was jailed for a period of time and after a lengthy defense,
eventually release.
The question maybe we should be asking is not "what are the rules" but
"how are we going to take back our Country and Freedom"? I, for one, do
not trust government employees, who are frequently the bottom of the
barrel, imnsho, to decide what is legal and what is not legal.

@_subject: Library Defeats Tor Followup Addl Info 
Ok, promised I would report back. My testing time has been limited so
this information is not complete, but will help I think. Here is what I
have found:
1) you cannot connect to any tor server until you connect first to a
library server, and accept the library TOS, else you get repeated error
messages from each tor server "will try again later..."
2) Once you have accepted the TOS on their web page through a direct
browser connection, then all DNS requests are made through that library
server, subjecting you to profiling and tracking.
Now the more interesting part:
You can defeat  by not allowing dns/p53 requests in you firewall
ruleset-that way all dns requests will then go directly to tor servers
(as far as my fw logs seem to indicate). This slows down the web page
and other requests considerably. I will have to relookup how to fix
Microsuck OS to do it's dns lookups directly from the client as I recall
it does not do it simply by putting entries in the hosts file.
Even if dns requests are made to the library machine, running a sniffer
seems to show that the TCP packets are still encrypted at the client
level. I have not had a chance to analyze the sniffer logs yet well yet,
but just watching the traffic shows encrypted TCP going to and from tor
servers, so that part is safe.
You must disable dns requests at the firewall to prevent leaking to the
library IP.
Once you do that it appears (again, on the surface without too much
study) that your traffic, including dns requests is safe.
I will do more intensive analysis and testing as time and access to the
library connection permits.
Any useful comments and feedback appreciated.

@_subject: Library Defeats Tor 
In attempting to connect to TOR servers from a radio connection to our
local library wifi node (open to the public, no id required), I get a
series of error messages from TOR servers something like, from memory,
"redirecting //tor/bunchofencrypted symbols, will try again later..."
In order to make ANY connection from my laptop (after establishing a
radio link with the library access point) to any tor server, you must
FIRST go to a library title page, then agree to TOS and then you can
connect to tor servers. Prior to doing that, all you get is repeated
error messages like the one above. Firewall log shows no connections
being made.
Then after agreeing to the TOS, you are able to connect to tor servers,
but all dns requests go through a library computer IP, such that they
can see and record where you are going. I am not sure if they can see
the TCP content, but the UDP (which I assume is the dns lookups are all
being monitored and probably logged by the library server through which
you are connected. Firewall logs clearly show the outgoing and incoming
DNS packets to the library IP. Rest of connections to Tor servers in the
firewall log appear normal.
I have not run a sniffer yet on this, because my laptop is old and it
might not be able to handle it. But tor anonymity is obviously shot when
connecting to their wifi nodes. I believe I tried to block the DNS
lookups to the Library IP with privoxy generic block rules and then I
could not load any web pages, indicating again that the dns requests are
first being routed to the library machine, where they are, of course,
logged (and maybe sent off to the FBI, if your reading muslim materials,

the dns requests are being subverted. Perhaps the traffic is being
shuttled from the kernel OS to a library server. IOW tor should provide
the encryption necessary and no wifi encryption should be needed. I will
