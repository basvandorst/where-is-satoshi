@_subject: Question: How to set where you emerge from the Tor Cloud? 
Hey Folks,
New to Tor, but love the idea and the functionality.  Privacy is my
business right now, so I find this a great effort.
I've installed Tor and all on Firefox, and it works great.  Problem is
I can't quite figure out how to control the country from  which I
emerge from the Tor Cloud.  I need this to be able to check how a
particular website treats me based on my in-country IP addresss. e.g.,
I want to go to Facebook through Tor and emerge with a UK IP address
to assess whether Facebook sees me as coming from a UP IP addy.
Any help would be appreciated.

That's fine... for this exercise I don't really care about the
anonymity.   Can you literally describe how to do that?  the UI has me
a bit confused on how to do this?

The BSI comment had me rolling on the floor.   Could you imagine the
paperwork?  If you're going to RSA, they'll be there.
