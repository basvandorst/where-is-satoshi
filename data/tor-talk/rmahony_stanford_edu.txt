@_subject: [tor-talk] virtual private servers for Tor? 
What virtual private server software do you know works well--or badly--with running a Tor server?
      I want to buy cheap VPS's devoted exclusively to running Tor servers.  The VPS's often limit traffic to, say, 200GB.  I see companies offering Xen, OpenVZ, VMware, Virtuozzo, and many others.        Such a service is now available for about $20 a month, from many vendors.  An inexpensive good deed.

@_subject: [tor-talk] geographic location? 
Does it help Tor users if I start a Tor server running in or near any particular country or city?  For example, in or near countries with intrusive domestic surveillance; countries with no other Tor servers; a city along a particular cable (e.g.      I am going to buy virtual private servers devoted exclusively to running
 Tor servers.  I'd like to make them as helpful as possible.
     Thanks,

Why are we encouraged to use the Amazon Cloud VPS's for bridges only?  Why not set up some as relays?

@_subject: [tor-talk] orbot vs. tor 
If Orbot can transparently proxy traffic from an Android phone--browser, chat, email--why can't Tor do it for a laptop or desktop?  Incorrect premise?

@_subject: [tor-talk] funnel many computers through one TBB? 
Friend J doesn't want to install a Tor Browser Bundle on each of the 50
computers in his company.  Can he install one TBB on his router and
configure it so that it sends his employees' browser traffic through the
Tor network?  Is it advisable?  Where are instructions?  So sorry that I
couldn't find them.  Shall I persuade him instead to do the 50
installations of TBB?
