@_subject: [tor-talk] VPN->TOR check 
Is there any way to check if my traffic through TOR Browser (and
torbirdy) goes through VPN first and after through TOR?
I have the VPN client (OpenVPN/Linux) working and fine. I first start
the VPN connection and after that I open TOR Browser. Because TOR
service is already started (at the system startup), does it reroutes
aromatically through VPN when I connect the VPN? Or do I have to open
vidalia and restart it (stop-start) or restart from terminal?
