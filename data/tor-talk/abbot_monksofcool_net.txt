@_subject: [tor-talk] My experience contributing to any Tor Project 
* George:
That may be your opinion, or perhaps the community council's opinion,
but that still does not make it gospel. I have received both criticism
and praise for my comments about the website changes on the tor-users
mailing list. As far as I can determine based on email I received, how
satire is perceived is mostly divided along cultural/national lines.
I think that the notion of "if you don't have anything positive to say
don't say anything at all" is counterproductive. If it looks like a
duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a
duck, and I don't care one iota how much time and effort somebody spent
trying to create a swan, and failed at it.
Nobody has to share my opinion (however, there was more agreement than
criticism), but I'll not sacrifice that honest opinion for political
correctness. I determine what is appropriate for me, and at my age I
have damn well earned that right.

* Udo van den Heuvel:
My impression is that those involved in developing that monstrosity of
a website expect critics to suck it up. I repeat what I said on the
tor-users list: I think the new site is dumbed down way too much, and
I'd like to have the old site back, because it treated visitors like
intelligent human beings and offered useful information instead of a
painful UI and a plethora of buzzwords.
Oh, and don't tell me how the above is "disrespectful". It is my opinion
and I don't care who feels unappreciated.

@_subject: [tor-talk] A question about the Tor Bulk Exit List exporting 
* Jason Long:
Tor Exits cannot be used as HTTP(S) or SOCKS proxies. It would be a bad
idea anyway, for security reasons.
