@_subject: [tor-talk] A Course Project 
Dears Tor team
I am doing my Phd in Concordia university Montreal, and I have a course
about network security INSE 6120. The professor of this course wants us to
do a project in both the field of security research with some practical
application, and I have chosen TOR and its applications.
I am looking for a problem to solve even in TOR tool or using TOR tool.
I will be grateful if you give me any hints or ideas for my project.
Best Regards
