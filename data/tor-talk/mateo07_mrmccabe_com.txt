@_subject: Need help with MPAA threats 
Time Warner shut off my connection again last night due to a complaint from the MPAA.  They claim that I downloaded 2 movies and 1 TV show.  This traffic, in fact, must have come through my Tor exit node.
I explained to the customer service agent that I am running a Tor exit node and that the traffic must have come through the Tor network.  He said that because this is the 3rd complaint, the MPAA may take me to court and sue me for $100,000 per violation.  He also claimed that "others in similar situations" have lost in court...whatever that means.
Here is where I need your help.  First, is there a good way to filter out torrents in my exit policy?
Second, have any exit node operators in the US had similar complaints from the MPAA?  If so, how did you handle the complaints?
Lastly, has anyone in the US gone to court as a result of using Tor?  If so, do you have a reference for a good lawyer?  At this point, I want to continue running a Tor exit node but also want to investigate my legal options if the MPAA takes me to court.
Thank you for your help!

Thank you for all of your suggestions regarding exit policies and contacting the EFF.  I am a member and will be beating down Kurt Opsahl's door if the MPAA decides to pursue this any further.
So just to clarify, it is possible to transfer bit torrent file content over Tor, right?  And the only way to reduce or eliminate this traffic is by using a white-list exit policy?  Roger, can you confirm this?

@_subject: Abuse complaint 
Last night, Time Warner Cable temporarily disabled my account due to an alleged attack coming from my IP address and targeting a server in Europe (Denmark I believe).  Below is the e-mail I sent them to respond to the complaint.
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to respond to these complaints?  Is IP filtering the best (or only) option for addressing TWC's issues?
Thanks for your help,
Dear Time Warner Cable,
Last night I was notified that my cable modem Internet service had been temporarily disabled due to an abuse complaint.  I called and left a message on your abuse telephone number last night and received a call today from one of your representatives.  She explained that an attack on a server in Europe had been launched from my IP address.  I explained to your representative that I am running a Tor relay node which someone may have used to launch an attack.
Here is a description of what Tor is (from torproject.org):
"Tor is network software that helps users to enhance their privacy, security, and safety online. It does not host or make available any content. Rather, it is part of a network of nodes on the Internet that simply pass packets among themselves before sending them to their destinations, just as any Internet host does. The difference is that Tor tunnels the connections such that no hop can learn both the source and destination of the packets, giving users protection from nefarious snooping on network traffic. Tor protects users against hazards such as harassment, spam, and identity theft. In fact, initial development of Tor, including deployment of a public-use Tor network, was a project of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, with funding from ONR and DARPA. (For more on Tor, see To be clear, this attack was not launched from any computer that I own and instead may have come from the inappropriate use of the Tor network.  I explained to your representative that if she would forward me the abuse complaint, I would configure Tor so that this server would not be accessible from my Tor relay.  Specifically, I will deny access to the server that was attacked from my Tor relay using IP address filtering.  Thus, I need the IP address of the server in question before I will be able to setup this policy.
If you receive any new abuse complaints for my account, please e-mail or call me before disabling my Internet connection.  If you give me specific information about the abuse complaint, I will do my best to immediately address the issue.
Here is my contact information:
Thank you,
Matthew McCabe

Yup, and I suspected that they would say something about that...but they didn't.  The TWC representative just asked me to assure that the attack would not occur again.  So perhaps ISPs are accepting the reality that customers will run "servers" on residential cable modem service?

Yup, I restricted my exit node policy in hopes that it would limit torrent traffic and it seemed to work.  However, the last "hacking" complaint was the result of someone making excessive or inappropriate postings on a newsgroup or website.  So while the torrent/DMCA complaints stopped, the "hacking" complaints continued.

So Time Warner Cable finally gave me an ultimatum that either I stop running Tor or they will shut off my service.  This was after 3 DMCA and 2 general abuse/hacking complaints.  Note that Time Warner does not say anything about proxy servers in their AUP.  They were just tired of getting these complaints on my account.  Also, AT&T was not able to setup DSL service at my location...so I have decided to kill my Tor exit I would really like to continue running a Tor exit node.  I have looked at a couple virtual hosting companies such as vpslink and slicehost.  Some of their cheaper plans seem like they would be sufficient for running a Tor exit node.  Does anyone run Tor on a VPS?  If so, which company and plan do you use?  Have you gotten any flack for running a Tor exit node?

Wow, that is a very cool idea.  This could even be turned into a non-profit organization...  We could take donations to support running Tor exit nodes which, in turn, supports everyone's ability to use the Internet without fear of censorship, harassment, and authoritarian (or up-and-coming authoritarian) governments.
What do you all think?
By the way, there was a Nova special last night on the NSA and their "minority report" like computer system in development:

I take issue with the premise that the only course of action that ISPs have is to disconnect customers that generate these complaints.  I know that some ISPs simply pass on the complaints to their customers with the expectation that the customer fix the problem.  It seems to me that this is all the ISP is required to do (see the EFF DMCA response letter for

I agree that it may be a risk for one organization to own a large number of Tor nodes.  But if that organization is a non-profit and run by some of the Tor users, developers, and operators on this list, that should reduce the risk that the organization will willingly compromise its Tor Also, you could setup an independent auditing system in which Tor "experts" could examine the Tor boxes or VPSs to be sure that they are not compromised.
It is all about transparency!

I agree that starting a business may be problematic but I am not sure this would be true for a non-profit in the US.
Does anyone know if US non-profits are required to log connection information?  I help several businesses (including a large company) and non-profits maintain their websites, networks, etc. and am not aware of any requirement to log this kind of information.

I sent TWC a modified version of the EFF DMCA response letter for the DMCA takedown notices.  I even personally replied to one of the DMCAs from an agent for Paramount.  I was only able to personally reply to one of the complaints as TWC would not forward me any of the other notices.
The technician from the abuse department said that because my account already had 5 complaints, he would disconnect me if I received another.  He was very clear on that point.  He understood that I was running Tor and that this traffic was coming from the Tor network.  Again, there is nothing in the AUP or TOS that stated that I could not run a service like Tor.  But it does state that violating intellectual property rights and "hacking" are not allowed.  As I explained previously, 3 of the notices were DMCA notices (copyright violations) and 2 were hacking complaints.  This tech and TWC believe that the user of their service is responsible for any of these violations.  Thus, it seems that they may try to disconnect my service based upon these 5 complaints.
Again, I would rather setup Tor on a VPS if anyone has a recommendation for a company and hosting plan!

@_subject: more on the Comcast 250 GB/mo. problem 
Sorry to hear that you are also having problems with your ISP.  I ended up dropping Time Warner and signing up for Earthlink - which actually uses the same TWC network.  So now I am back on TWC and must watch my p's and q's or I will be kicked off.  I even have the same TWC account number...  And, according to the last TWC security official, I will be kicked off their network if I get another Tor related complaint.
My solution was to get the cheapest Earthlink connection for my home use and to setup a VPS that is running a Tor exit node.  I am using Linode's VPS services and have a "Linode 540" account that gives me 300 GB per month of data transfer.  So I can run a 50K/s Tor exit node without worrying about my home Internet being disconnected.  Worst case scenario is that Linode tells me to stop running Tor and I do...and then look for a more friendly VPS company to do all of my future business with.  But I have had no complaints for the past couple months.
Incidentally, Time Warner Cable's security department made it very clear that they did not want to have me as a customer.  I explained to them that I paid extra for increased bandwidth which I intended to use.  The security representative said that I was not a business customer (i.e. paying 2-3 times as much for the same connection) and thus they would not tolerate any more complaints.  He did not mention any complaints about bandwidth...  But it is clear that Time Warner Cable does not care about you as a customer unless you are a business customer.  Only then will they give you a chance to explain why you have received unjustified and unproven complaints.

I gave a talk to a small group of people on Saturday at BarCampAustin:   I have also given this talk in two of my graduate classes at St. Edward's University.  These kinds of informal talks are a great way to educate others about Internet censorship, Internet monitoring, what Tor is, how to run a Tor server, etc.  In each of my talks, the response has been positive.  If nothing else, they now know that their Internet traffic IS being monitored and that they have a choice about whether or not to succumb to that monitoring.
If anyone is interested, I will e-mail you a copy of my "Introduction to Tor" presentation.  I may also create a Google presentation and share it with the world if there is enough interest...
Has anyone else given these kinds of talks about Tor?  Perhaps we could combine our Tor educational resources and put them on a website...?
