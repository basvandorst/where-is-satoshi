@_subject: [tor-talk] tbb (disable network is set) 
I don't know if this is the correct mailing list to post this
question, so in that case my apologies in advance.
Last year I was using TBB (on windows server 2003 32bits PC) for a
while and it was working perfect, suddenly it stopped working and the
logs said "DisableNetwork is set. Tor will not make or accept
non-control network connections. Shutting down all existing
connections...". At that time I just stopped using TBB and I checked
TBB frequently, one day, suddenly again, apparently with no change on
my computer or my network it started working again for a while but
right now I have the same problem as before, it stopped working again
and the logs said "DisableNetwork is set. Tor will not make or
Now I have a strong decision to find where is the problem:
1. I have spent a lot of hours surfing the web looking for a solution.
Many many people has the same problem, but only a few have found a
2. The rules and firewall of my antivirus are fine,  even with the
antivirus totally deactivated it does not work.
3. I have normal access to torproject.org throught firefox browser so
I don´t think my ISP is blocking the tor network or doing DPI.
4. I have checked my timezone against an internet service and the time
of my system seems to be incorrect but since I am behind a proxy
server that is far from my hands my timezone is that of the proxy
server and I can not fix it. Do you think this is the cause of the
problem? In this case is there a workarround for this?
5. I have been viewing the tor source code trying to figure out under
which conditions the DisableNetwork flag is set to 1, no much advance.
Can someone point out which source file is the one I´m looking for?
I can post the whole logs if someone is interested.
Thanks. Best regards.

I have deleted/reinstalled TBB many times and even updated TBB version
any time there is a new one.  I have edited torrc file but when I
start TBB again the DisableNetwork 0 line is deleted. Could you please
explain me the correct way to do this? I have the same results using
Custom Bridges for obfs4. Here are the whole logs:

2017-04-04 9:52 GMT-04:00, Beach and Yoga Lover :
Are you behind a proxy? It seems like you are setting a proxy that TBB
can not find. Take into account that when you start TBB it ask you if
you will Connect directly or if you will Configure your connection. If
you go through Configure in the third step it ask you if you are
behind a proxy, if not, just hit No and go ahead, if Yes you will need
your proxy settings for the next step. Please check that.
Good luck.

I do not have another uplink to test. I can try using a VPN, yes. Can
you point out which is the best way to configue TBB using a VPN if you
have used before.
Thanks in advance.
