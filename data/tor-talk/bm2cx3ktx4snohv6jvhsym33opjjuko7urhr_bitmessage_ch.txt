@_subject: [tor-talk] tor (relay) talk @ linux weeks (Austria/Vienna) 
Hi everyone,
I just saw that there will be a "Create a relay" talk [1] at the Linux
weeks in Vienna, so I figured I let you know in case you want to come by
and say hi.
Location: FH Technikum Wien, H?chst?dtplatz 6, 1200 Vienna
(links pointing to german content)
[1] Martin, you might want to fix the dead links on your site (the atlas link
is probably not working anymore due to a new relay FP?)
