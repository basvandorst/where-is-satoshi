@_subject: Tor 0.1.0.10 on OSX Tiger problems 
Hi all,
I've just tried to install Tor on a freshly installed copy of Mac OSX
Tiger (10.4).
After rebooting, it seems that privoxy is up and running just fine, but tor will
not start automatically.
privoxy is listed in the process list, while tor is not.
I can start Tor by hand, using "/Library/Tor/tor", but if i try to use
the startup script, I get errors.
As I understand it, Mac OS will run the script
"/Library/StartupItems/Tor/Tor" by itself, with no params.
When i try to do this, I get the following error: "./Tor: line 59: $1:
unbound variable"
If I start it by doing: "/Library/StartupItems/Tor/Tor start", then it
gets a bit further, and then dies with:
Jun 14 17:33:42.602 [notice] Torv0.1.0.10. This is experimental
software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity.
Jun 14 17:33:42.681 [err] switch_id(): User '_tor' not found.
Jun 14 17:33:42.681 [err] init_from_config(): Acting on config options
left us in a broken state. Dying.
Am i doing something wrong, or is there some other magic needed to get
Tor to start by itself on Mac OS?

My user is an admin user. I don't think there is anything special
about my security config (although, I have turned filevault on, if
that counts).
somewhere where I should look?

@_subject: Safari proxy switch applescript 
Hi Guys,
In response to a request from Paul Syverson, I fixed up an applescript
I found online
to work with the latest version of Mac OSX.
Safari does not have its own proxy settings, and instead, uses
whatever the OS is using. This script toggles the settings between
either no proxy, or the localhost privoxy proxy - and is thus,
something akin to "Tor Button" for Safari.
The script can be found here:
An application version of the script (that just requires a double
click to run) can be found here:
To get the script to work, you must set the "Enable access for
assistive devices" feature in the "Universal Access" system
If you install the Applescript Menu
you may find it easier to launch the script from within safari.
I'm happy to fix up the script a bit more, if I get any feedback from others.

@_subject: Researchers could face legal risks for Tor network snooping 
Full article available here:
A group of researchers from the University of Colorado and University of
Washington could face both civil and criminal penalties for a research
project in which they snooped on users of the Tor anonymous proxy network.
Should federal prosecutors take interest in the project, the researchers
could also face up to 5 years in jail for violating the Wiretap Act.
The team of two graduate students and three professors neither sought legal
review of the project, nor ran it past the Human Subjects Committee at their
university, putting them in a particularly dangerous position.
The academic paper, "Shining Light in Dark Places: Understanding the Tor
(pdf) was presented at the Privacy Enhancing Technologies
Symposiumyesterday, in Leuven, Belgium.
The authors are listed as: Damon
McCoy , Kevin
Dr. Dirk Grunwald,
Dr. Tadayoshi Kohno  and Dr. Douglas
Sicker .
