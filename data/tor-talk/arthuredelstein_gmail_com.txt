Hi Everyone,
As you know, when you use the Tor Browser Bundle, it's safest to
disable JavaScript using the NoScript extension. Unfortunately,
YouTube requires the use of JavaScript to watch videos. So I wrote a
fairly simple GreaseMonkey user script that lets you watch videos as
normal, with YouTube's JavaScript disabled.
The code is here, with links for installing GreaseMonkey and the script:
This is an early version. For some reason, the HTML5 video element's
play button doesn't work sometimes, but you can press "space" to pause
the video.
I think it might be useful to develop an "Unscripted" plugin that lets
us visit various useful but JavaScript-heavy websites, without running
their scripts. I'm interested to hear your feedback, and if you think
I'm on the right track.
