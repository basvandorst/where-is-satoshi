I have been getting a weird error with an STMP-TLS connection over Tor This direct connection works:
% openssl s_client -connect 83.223.73.105:465 depth=2 /O=Root CA/OU= Cert Signing Authority/emailAddress=support at cacert.org
verify error:num=19:self signed certificate in certificate chain
verify return:0
Torifying it causes the TLS handshake to fail:
% torify openssl s_client -connect 83.223.73.105:465
24520:error:140770FC:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:unknown protocol:s23_clnt.c:607:
Any idea?
PS: I sent this three days ago without being subscribed and the moderater never ack'd it.

I'll try. But I'm running a Tor Relay, so isolating my traffic is kind of hard :)
The thing is: it works without Tor.
The Server is a qmail, although the port there is a Stunnel.
