@_subject: Analyzing TOR-exitnodes for anomalies 
Hi all,
I did some google (yahoo either) sarch but did not find the ghost-like
"Linux Magazine" site you have encountered, that means this site could
be quite new (but writing a robots.txt can reject the crawlers if
someone is intend to crime and trying to avoid the others to find the
clues). Also, the logo "linux-magazine.com what you need, when you
need it" is a image or just text?
Maybe it is a DNS poisoning job, maybe some guy runs a local DNS
server as well as a tor node to make some profit by directing us to
this bogus linux-magazine? Interesting.
