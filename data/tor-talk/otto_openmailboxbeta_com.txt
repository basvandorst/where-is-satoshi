@_subject: [tor-talk] Can I use twitter with torbrowser? 
I've a twitter account. It is registered with a phone number which I no longer have access to.
Will twitter require phone verification if I login via torbrowser? (In which case I would likely loose access to my account since I no longer have that number and I do not want to give them another number)
