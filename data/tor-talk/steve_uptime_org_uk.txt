The Linksys NSLU2 (about 80 USD) can be made to run Linux, as described
in Sure, it's not the fastest of things with an XScale chip running at
133/266MHz and 32MB of RAM - but it's more than capable of running Tor
in client mode (this is what I assume you mean by proxy).

I think most big, public  keyservers sync with each other, yes.
Right. Which is why you should verify the key ID out-of-band (e.g. in
person at a conference) and/or work on developing your web of trust

Yep, the hide-tor-exit-notation filter in Privoxy >=3.0.6, which strips the exit node notation from the HTTP host and referer headers.

You laugh, but perhaps the Finnish authorities had seen this:

@_subject: Tor server on NSLU2: ORPort unreachable 
I tried this a year or two ago and experienced the same problem. Like you say, client functionality was fine (though slow) but it didn't want to work as a Tor node itself.
I don't believe the problem is a network (e.g. port forwarding) issue. I believe the problem is caused by either a) some incompatibility between the current implementation of the OpenSSL libraries and armv5tel, or b) the low spec of the device rendering key generation too slow for the reachability checks.
Ultimately I didn't have time to investigate further, and I have no hard evidence to support either of my theories. That said, I have a known-good Tor configuration that worked on an x86 desktop machine, but not on an armv5tel NSLU2.
Interested to hear how you get on,

It's worth a try, though I was unable to get Tor working in server mode on a similarly spec'd (CPU-wise) Linksys NSLU2.
Let us know how it works out...
