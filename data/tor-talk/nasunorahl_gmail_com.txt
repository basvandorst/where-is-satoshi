You had me until the reference to the Telecommunications
Reform Act, at which point it became propaganda and ignored.
A authentic Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace would stand
the test of time and not resort to such.

Lara my apologies but I don't understand what you are implying.

I am always a sincere person and try never to say more by my words
