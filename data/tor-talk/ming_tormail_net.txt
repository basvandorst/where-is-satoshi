I propose someone create a new page for Torifying software, aimed squarely

Vidalia to use an HTTP proxy be enough? If so, where and what do we

Tales from the DNSCrypt: Linux Rising
# News & Notes from the OpenDNS team
# by David Ulevitch, Founder/CEO on Feb 16th, 2012
When we released the Mac-only preview of DNSCrypt, we knew it was a game
changer. The revolutionary piece of lightweight software encrypts all DNS
traffic between you and our servers. We also knew it was our
responsibility to get this fundamental improvement to Internet security
ready for the masses as quickly as possible. That?s why last week we
announced that we?re searching for a rockstar win32 hacker to build a
Windows release. But the blog post catalyzed a frenzy of responses from
Linux users asking when a version would be available for them.
The good news, is that the wait is over for Linux users. In fact, there
was never a wait at all. We published the code for DNSCrypt on GitHub when
we released the preview, so although there isn?t a user interface built
just yet, Linux users can still experience the benefits of DNSCrypt in
just a few steps. Here are simple step-by-step instructions for setting up
DNSCrypt on your Linux machine:

Who is 93.114.40.75?
The Tor check page lists it and says I'm not using Tor. Another user
reported this, too.
I loaded the Tor check page today and it said I wasn't using Tor. The IP
listed was: 93.114.40.75. I checked blutmagie's site and it said I wasn't
using Tor, with the same IP address listed as the Tor check page with the
failure notice. This IP wasn't listed at blutmagie's site, and it's not
listed in either of my local Tor Data cached-descriptors and
cached-descriptors.new files.
I searched and found another user encountered this problem with this IP
and the Tor check page, as posted on the Tor blog. Here are the details
from the other user, and a lookup of the IP which follows. Something,
"funny" is going on here, and I recommend an investigation and/or
blacklist for this IP: 93.114.40.75.

This is my second attempt today to send this message. Is it being deleted

of the browser and (maybe, IMO) the developers (may) wish to keep (a
larger majority of the) people in this walled Tor browser garden? My

Wow, Anonymous! Wow, what an amazing, "bug".
Linux users, check your Tor Browser Bundle install directory for the file:
"vidalia-debug-log" and examine it.
Is a new version with a fix in the works?
