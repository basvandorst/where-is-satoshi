@_subject: what data transmission with tor is a security risk ? 
It depends on the authentication scheme used--Basic authentication
just sends the username and password encoded in base64, and is
basically as bad as plaintext auth. If the server uses digest
authentitication, however, you're correct.

@_subject: [Full-disclosure] Firefox 2.0.x: tracking unsuspecting users using TLS client certificates 
It occurs to me that this could be used to good effect to track someone
using Tor across various domains you control. Most Tor users know to kill
JS, Flash, and are more than normally paranoid about cookies, but may not
think twice about accepting a client certificate. I'm CC'ing the Tor mailing
list to see what they think...
Can anyone see if this works through Privoxy and the other things in the
standard Tor bundle?
