Dear Tor Volunteers and Engineers,
Hope you are fine.
You know i had wrote an email about TB Android's built-in bridges and few days later you released new build with new changes. I installed TB 8.5.1 and tried again. I waited for minutes but no luck. Respectfully nothing is changed. I captured two (2) screenshots of TB Android. I attached those and also uploaded.
Thank you in advance.
Kind Regards,
