@_subject: Provider 1blu closed exit node torpaulianer 
I just want to inform you that the german provider 1blu Ag in Berlin
closed down my tor exit node torpaulianer for violating the contract by
running malicious software.
So far I didn't had time to answer them on that, but it looks like I
have to look for another provider.

I can confirm that: I run the tor exit node "torpaulianer" on a vserver
at 1blu. It's up for 120 days without any errors.

Hash: SHA1
No, you can't - or at least shouldn't - trust any maintainer of a tor
router. No one can keep people from setting up several tor exit nodes in
order to gain information, passwords, what else ... (already happened)
The only way to gain the integrity of your data sent through the
internet and especially tor, is by using protocols which make use of a
secure encryption layer. So if you send data which could reveal your
identity you have to use such a secure protocol.

@_subject: You are not safe anymore on TOR 
I can't see anything new here. If you are concerned for your anonymity
you have to take care of your client softaware as well: Of course you
should turn off java script, flash, java applets etc ... Tor is only one
part of the deal ...

talking about the client side? The answer is yes. Take a look at
FoxyProxy. Other solutions might exist ...

No, it's not an overkill since tor does not provide end-to-end
encryption, but anonymity on the level of IP addresses. Actually it is
highly recommended to use tor with ssl secured services:

@_subject: DuckDuckGo now operates a Tor exit enclave 
Hi Eugen,
I'm wondering why you posted this without any comment.
As far as I could see, DDH is a search engine frontend.
So what does this statement exactly mean? Do you use their exit nodes
when doing a browser request to their search engine or is it when using
links on DDG search results?
How can such a behaviour be technically achieved?
I don't see any chance how for doing such a thing. Even if so, what's
its purpose?
I am really confused by this. Seems like I oversee something important.
Perhaps someone can help me out of this.
Regards, Michael

@_subject: DuckDuckGo now operates a Tor exit enclave 
Hi all,
thanks a lot for your answers.
I did some additional reading and now have a vague idea how tor exit
enclaving works.
As far as I understand, enclaving doesn't break tor anonymity and
privacy. Quite contrary to this, anonymity may be even enhanced by it
On the other hand, there are still some points coming up with the post
of Eugen that remain unclear to me:
1. Eugen is posting this text from
without any comment to this mailinglist. This blog enrtry looks alot
like an adveritsment to me. Eugens intentions are hidden. So perhaps he
is connected to duckduckgo.com in some way or perhaps he is not.
2. Why is it offering HTTP
If duckduckgo.com really cares for the anonymity and privacy of its
users, why do they offer unencrypted HTTP?
Even if tor users are encouraged to use HTTPS, some of them will forget
doing so.
3. "This site requires JavaScript."
In my opinion this point is the worst: When I entered
 with NoScript enabled (my default) I can read the
message "This site requires JavaScript." just below the search box. So
duckduckgo.com wants its user to turn on java script. But with java
script enabled your anonymity is nearly switched off.
Perhaps duckduckgo.com's primary intention is not offering anonymous
services. Probably they just want to offer another alternate search
engine. And perhaps they just think offering a tor enclave is a nice
addon. So perhaps in conclusion, they didn't think much about anonymity
and privacy. I don't know it.
But why was this ad posted to the tor mailinglist?
just my 2c, Michael

@_subject: Cannot retrieve apt key from keyserver 
Hi David,
perhaps it was just a temporary problem. When I search for the key I get
the following:
gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --search-keys 886DDD89
gpg: searching for "886DDD89" from hkp server keys.gnupg.net
(1)     deb.torproject.org archive signing key
          2048 bit RSA key 886DDD89, created: 2009-09-04
You can install this software without the key by ignoring the warning,
but this is not recommended.
For receiving the key you can try another keyserver like pgp.mit.edu or
If you prefer a Webbrowser you can try this link:
