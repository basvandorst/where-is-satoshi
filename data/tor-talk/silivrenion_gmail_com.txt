@_subject: New PortableTor 
PortableTor is a rebundled version of the Vidalia-Privoxy bundle that comes
out on the torproject.org website. This project was created in order to
allow the end user full functionality, optimal disk space, and easy
adaptation of portable applications with the Tor network. It can run on a
flash drive, a desktop, external drive, iPod, and if modified, even on a
solid medium, such as a CD.
A new version of PortableTor has been released (and is released every stable
update.) based on 0.1.2.18a-0.0.4 Vidalia and Privoxy bundle. There's been a
few changes in this version that are significant on the PortableTor end:
* Reformatted directory structure to the PortableApps Format. This means
breaking down all directories into categories based on what they are,
instead of what bundles they were in. All config files are in one place, all
programs in one place, and all documentation in one place.
* Thanks to the fix in bug 499, AvoidDiskWrites 1 doesn't leave a remnant
behind in the temporary files anymore.
* Made Tor start automatically by default. I assume if someone opens
PortableTor, they want to join the network.
If you're interested in getting PortableTor, head over to
 . There you will find the main project goals,
download links, recommended additions and usages, as well as support forums
and discussion topics. Criticism and feedback are welcome on the Sourceforge
forums! Any direct questions can be made to Silivrenion at
silivrenion at gmail.com .
Future developments:
There's some work being done on making the launcher smarter to be able to
regenerate missing sections of the package. Also using the PortableTor
gateway on solid storage devices by default, e.g. giving a friend a
PortableTor/PortableFirefox CD for a stocking stuffer.

I did notice torbrowser was in the directory format that is friendly with
PortableApps format applications, so props on that.
Interesting take, taking what Portable Tor  has
done and bringing it to an all inclusive bundle.

I have to disagree with setting any options by default like that. The
concept behind PortableTor as I wrote it was to let the end user have the
right to decide what to do.. don't force anything on them! I think this
concept should be relevant to all bundles.. don't force users to become
nodes, because you have those out there that possibly don't want to be,
plus in my opinion it hurts the usefulness of the package to have that
automatically on.
As someone mentioned earlier, a portable tor approach is useful for the
client, not necessarily the server end. You can cause a lot of server
identity problems if you log on as a tor server just to check your email
for 5 minutes.
Let the end user decide what they want their software to do.
On a more positive note, congrats on bringing up a new system :)

@_subject: New PortableTor! 
PortableTor allows you to connect into the Tor anonymous internet system
from any computer with your flash or thumb drive. This allows you to browse
the internet anonymously from public locations, such as internet hotspots,
library, or school computers and public terminals. PortableTor has all of
the features as the regular Tor, except without actually installing the
application. You could also use PortableTor if you just don't like
installing programs on your computer, and you'd rather have a standalone
program with all of its dependant files in one location.
We have done a lot of work on new updates recently, including completely
restructuring the program into the PortableApps format, creating an NSIS
launcher that monitors file integrity on launch, and much more. Many of our
updates came from our new partnership with Matt Morton, who offered to merge
his Torvox program with PortableTor. The latest update of PortableTor brings
everyone up to package PortableTor-0.1.2.19-0.0.16-1.
Please check out the latest PortableTor package at

@_subject: PortableTor Small Update 
Sorry about that folks, we've had to update again due to a configuration
glitch with the trustfile option being on by default. New version available
at Feedback is encouraged on the project forums!
Thanks again,

PortableTor is a rebundled version of the Vidalia-Privoxy bundle that comes
out on the torproject.org website. This project was created in order to
allow the end user full functionality, optimal disk space, and easy
adaptation of portable applications with the Tor network. It can run on a
flash drive, a desktop, external drive, iPod, and if modified, even on a
solid medium, such as a CD.
A new version of PortableTor has been released (and is released every stable
update.) based on 0.1.2.19-0.0.16 Vidalia and Privoxy bundle. This is a
medium-level update that affects client logging of information.
Debugger information was set to verbose (debug 1) via privoxy, causing
PortableTor to log traffic made locally. This new version fixes this
configuration default to save logging space and provide even more security
You will also notice that the new version of PortableTor uses a new file
format compatible with the PortableApps format of applications. We are
continuing development of this package for interoperability, but as of right
now, PortableTor is not an officially signed package, it just works with the
system anyway. Part of this effort also allows PortableTor to regenerate
configuration files if it finds they have become deleted or corrupted.
We are still working on new ways to bring PortableTor to new devices and
storage mediums.
