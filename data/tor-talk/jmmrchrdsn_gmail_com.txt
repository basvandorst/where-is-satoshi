This won't work well seeing Google is already kicked out of China. The censors would not hesitate to block a few high profile sites, they actually want this to happen so that they can replace the high profile sites with their own copycat sites like the Baidu search engine in China. This is where Telex gets it right: You have to force the censor to choose between full internet or no internet, a few sites just won't cut it.
This is not about privacy, it's about anti-censorship, and Google is a good resource in terms of anti-censorship.

I think the assumption is the protocol would be supported by democratic governments, who will persuade their ISP to connect the stations, and encircle authoritarian country's internet access. So in this case, interest in not getting into trouble with their government can be used for good.

Google AppEngine provides a platform which can be used to run your own proxy servers for free, Gtalk supports XMPP which can also be used to circumvent censorship.
I don't think there is a direct relationship, the two concerns (privacy/anonymity and anti-censorship) can be separated. They only come together in some use cases, for example if you want to speak up against the censoring government; but in a lot of other use cases they are unrelated, for example if the user just want to view a video totally unrelated to politics on youtube.
True, but I don't see anything wrong with this, we can leverage their desire for profit for other purposes.
I think we may have different assumptions here. You're assuming the user may face imprisonment if they break the censorship and access blocked content, my assumption is the censoring government will not bother to catch people who circumvent censorship as long as they don't actively go against the government.
Yes, but internet has some huge advantage over other methods, that is why censoring governments are afraid of it.
No, it's certainly not the best idea, but life doesn't always give you the best tool for the job, sometimes you just have to use whatever is handy.

I agree, but again, we were talking about anti-censorship, not anonymity. Frankly people in China or Iran has much more to fear from their own government than from US authorities.

Actually I do see your point, as I have said, we have different assumptions regarding how censor would react to anti-censorship activities, let's just agree to disagree here. But even under your assumption, I don't see the reason to bash Google here. True, Google could sell you out to governments, but so could any company (for example your ISP). The difference between Google and your average company is: a. Google actually made a stand against censorship, and suffered the retaliation; b. Google is providing computation resources for free. If you want privacy/anonymity, you just need to code encryption routines for the proxy you run on Google's AppEngine, it's no different from the suggestion to run Tor over Telex. And for the free service they provided against censorship, we should be thanking Google (and Telex if it gets built). As far as I can see, Tor is already losing against the censors, I think Tor should welcome some help in fighting against them.

What the hell are you talking about? The whole idea of Tor is anonymity, and you want Tor to make it easy to identify its users?
Thomas Jefferson already answered your question: The man who would choose security over freedom deserves neither.

All fiat money is a scam by this definition. Value cannot be created by print a paper (or in Fed's case, an open market operation) either, but that's what the governments do everyday.
