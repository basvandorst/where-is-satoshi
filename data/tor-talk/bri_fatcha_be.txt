Hello all,
This is my first post.
I have a question regarding the article "Tor: the Second-Generation Onion
Routeur" [  ] , I
would like some clarification. It would be fantastic if you could help me :)
In point 4 (Page 4) the article talks about differents keys:
- A long term identity key: to sign TLS certificate, OR route descriptor
and to sign directories.
- A short-term onion key: used to decrypt requests from users.
- Ephemerals keys ( first words on page 5 )
- And "link keys" for TLS communication.
My question is: do you think the last two of them ( Ephemerals and link
eyes ) are the same one ?
Because I don't find any clear informations about those "ephemerals"
Thanks for reading me.

just to be sure what I understand:
"It sounds like the 'ephemeral keys' you mention could be the circuit-level
 keys, that is, the symmetric keys negotiated by the circuit handshake and
used for the lifetime of that circuit."
Is it the 128-bit AES key? They are talking about in point 4.1 of the
Kind regards,
