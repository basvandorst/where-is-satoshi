@_subject: [tor-talk] Hardened Tor Browser for Windows 
Exact, usually in companies people can not set up softwares, so
Virtualbox is a dream...
And sometimes people can not use USB-Key !
Proxies and others networking security by admins (we can understand
that!) are blocking/logging/filtering web surf. Because for example in
my country, the big boss is responsible about the websurf on the company
: if a guy is surfing on a bad website, the boss is the "guy behind the
IP logged", so Tor Browser can be a solution to surf without using the
company's IP

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser, always same Entry node 
This is some days ago I'm watching the Tor circuit the browser is using
to achieve a website, with the Tor button showing the Entry - Relay - Exit
I don't remember when I've really start, but it's always the same Entry
node IP the TBrowser is using.
On another computer, same thing... After re-downloaded a fresh TB,
another new Entry IP came, but stays too since some days ago.
Clicking "New Identity" only change the Middle + Exit node, not the
Entry IP...
Am I alone to always stay on the same Entry node ?
TBrowser has to always change the circuits to preserve anonymity and
make hard to follow a customer ?

But if you are stuck on a bad guard, you will use it may be some weeks... :s
The Guard will always know when you're online, because of your home IP
static, bandwidth used...
I think too! But I think it has to be a default option ;)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and forward email to Spam folder. 
Thx for this.
But sometimes, mail servers (are checking if the sender domain name = IP
? to prevent spam ?
May be I'm wrong, not an expert ;)
I see on mine bad guyz trying to send mails from a domain name not equal
to the IP from it's sent... is it "reading" the header informations to
make it possible ?

What about the Firefox OS / Boot2Gecko smartphone operating system ?
I've tried to find Tor Browser in the Marketplace, but sadly it's not here.
It can be so nice to use this browser with this OS everyday ;)
Is it planned ?

Yeah, exact Mozilla is not working more on FFOS,
but "the community" has now the project (smartphone part) in their hands ;)
Now it's Boot2Gecko (1st name of the project...) and people is working
on this OS everyday, so it will continue to live...
So it can be interesting to have another browser like Tor Browser
available for this smartphone OS ;)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Using Raspberry Pi as Tor relay is bad idea?? 
Exact !
RPi v1 was always CPU / RAM killed ! No crypto acceleration in the CPU.
Now my old RPi 1 is only TOR client, offering Tor for home LAN via
Socks, it's fine ;)
About a relay, it can be cool with a RPi v3, it has crypto AES that can
help a lot, if I'm not wrong.

I've not found any page about this kind of hardware on torproject.org ?
May be it can be useful to have a page for people interested, bandwidth
available, CPU, ram...
Playing those days with Freedombox, here is a example page...
With performance available, it can be really useful ;)
Relay / Bridge / Client only to route LAN...
People will be able to add their own results as we can see here about
RPi sdcards perf.

 (5 years ago)
Which tests can be really interesting ? Some command lines to launch to
have good and interesting results about this king of benchmark ?

Tor is here to help you about privacy, and changing circuits/IP will be

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is tor network 100 percent anonymous ? 
with more and more relays driven by volunteers, we can reduce this risk.
And this is an reason why server operators are using "myfamily" field in
the relay configuration, to not use other relays driven by them...
Be careful about exists relays, the server operator can sniff the
traffic, and if I'm not wrong, can retrieve for example a password in
clear text sent on a http (not http*s*!) form.
About circuits used to surf the web, your Tor browser will change
automatically every 10minutes if I'm not wrong.
You can check it on the little onion button... Try to visit the same
website on a new tab, another circuit will be used.
->For sure some "older" Tor people have better explanations to this
question ;)
But for me, Tor is a good network to annoy people who are trying to spy
you ;) Absolutely better than using the usual home network...

Last time I had this on the log (stable release), it was because the

Some services unloaded, 1 of the 2 Tor instances stopped to eat less RAM...
Have you check your free RAM, +swap usage ?
"htop" is cool for a live view for example
