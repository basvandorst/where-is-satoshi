Hash: SHA512
I understand that JavaScript was enabled globally in the Tor Browser
Bundle for usability reasons as well as to prevent browser
fingerprinting. I believe this is the correct decision.
If the torproject were to disable it by default, that would not ensure
that users are protected in the future by similar methods. Sites can
be written in a way that if you do not allow JavaScript they simply
won't work at all. If I was writing an exploit I'd do this to
frustrate users so hopefully they enable JavaScript and accept my
exploit. Also future exploits may not use JavaScript, but may somehow
socially engineer the user into installing a browser extension or
something like that.
This brings us to another issue. This exploit wasn't new. It
had been on the Mozilla bug tracker for a while. Users running the
latest Tor Browser Bundle (17.0.7) didn't have any issues as their
browsers had been patched.
It is inappropriate for a web browser to not be automatically updated.
In this day and age where we have full disclosures about critical
bugs, we must also have a way for users to get patches easily and
effortlessly, let's please keep vulnerabilities to be 0day rather than
0month, or 0year.
Had the Tor Browser's update mechanism been working like the official
Mozilla Firefox browser and Google Chrome, this would not have been
nearly as serious.
Whonix users of course were protected in 3 ways, firstly whonixcheck
would have warned them about an outdated browser, secondly hardware
addresses would have been masked by virtual network interfaces and
thirdly the network isolation it provides would have made this kind of
exploit not possible in the first place.
TAILS users would have been protected similarly, from the first and
third issue.
I'd like to see torproject make a push for isolated network setups,
because the cold hard truth is running the Tor Browser Bundle on
windows while easy for the users is a nightmare for the developers,
and keeping it secure is a big, big task. Maybe even an officially
supported Tor distribution.
The Tor Browser Bundle has to work with the network configuration the
user has given it, which most certainly is not going to prevent
arbitrary code from directly contacting remote servers and
circumventing the Tor service.
Given the successfulness of this of this vector you can bet this will
become something governments will look to investing in, in the future.

You're forgetting an exploiter can use AngularJS or something similar
that uses MVC strategies to make the website non-functional until you
enable JavaScript on that page. Doing so, many users unaware of their
favorite website has been compromised would do so just thinking that
the site was updated to require JavaScript.
Unless you audit the JavaScript code "using noscript" isn't the
be-all-end-all protection. I believe the torproject provides that to
prevent some XSS attacks.
I believe the bigger problem here is that the Tor Browser needs to
automatically update itself. Users of 17.0.7 (june's release) were
unaffected. The idea that a web browser doesn't automatically accept
security patches is a joke in this day and age. That issue needs to be
Further I think more emphasis needs to be there to get users to use
isolated network setups like Whonix or TAILS, or some other officially
supported method that accomplishes the same outcomes. JavaScript will
be irrelevant if users are socially engineered to run some other
arbitrary code, possibly posing as a browser extension or email
attachment, ie a PDF.

Hash: SHA512
Basically you shouldn't enable it unless you're on something like
TAILS, Whonix, Libert? Linux or Ipredia OS (although that's more for
i2P rather than Tor).
A standard Windows box that can still access the Internet without
going through Tor, is vulnerable to attack, and I wouldn't recommend
enabling flash on that or JavaScript for that matter as that was
recently exploited.

Another vote for Whonix, if you're using virtual machines. That's

Then you should be able to figure it out yourself. You probably won't
get much help here as MacOSX Tiger users represent such a small market
Given that Apple don't spend any time on it the tools used to build
Tor probably won't either. It might work in theory, but don't expect
support. That is why it is called an "unsupported" operating system.
I'd rather not see the Tor Project or anyone else waste time with
unsupported operating systems. There are better things you could be
doing with your time.
If you need anonymity then you also need security. Using a system that
has outstanding/unknown unresolved CVEs doesn't sound like a good idea
if you want to keep your anonymity.
If you want to be particularly conservative about updates your best
bet is to use something like RHEL/Centos or Debian. Those usually have
a life cycle of around 10 years.
At the end of this year or so RHEL/Centos 7 will be out and that will
be probably supported until 2030 or thereabouts.

You need to see it from the other side of things as well.
While in theory something may work on many platforms, we're talking
about "support" which also requires testing. If each decade this gets
more time consuming because there's more platforms, so older ones have
to be dropped.
MacOSX is a special case as well, because the MacOSX operating system
only functions on Apple hardware. A new Mac cannot run an ancient
version of MacOSX, and likewise MacOSX cannot be legally virtualized
from another PC platform.
This means you're asking for support from a very small subsection of
Mac users, ones which have not upgraded to something newer (most would
have, as Chrome and Firefox won't work on Tiger).
A part from the fact his operating system has no vendor support
anymore - which means no security updates either.

Oh aren't you a special cookie.
and yes it usually is, because developers fix things that weren't
working as intended. They also depend on the support of other
developers, so when a platform has very few of them it makes things
harder for them.
I think I should make a thread complaining about how it's not fair
nobody will support my Amiga 500.

Hash: SHA512
Michael Wolf:
Not a lot to be gained from running the TBB inside a regular VM other
than isolation of malware. If you're using Tor then I assume anonymity
means something to you.
Have a look at Whonix it is designed specifically for this kind of
usage. Additionally it isolates the Tor service in it's own VM to
provide extra network security from malware that could by-pass the Tor
service and directly access some remote location thus revealing you.
Most attacks about breaking out of a VM rely on you installing the
guest tools, so never do that.

Just keep in mind the KMail User-Agent also sends your kernel release
ie 'uname -r' and architecture.
Also it leaks your computer's hostname in the Message-ID
 where as Thunderbird uses
the domain name.
I guess if anonymity really means something to you, you're using
TAILS, Whonix or something like Libert? Linux where nothing linking to
your real identity is concerned.
