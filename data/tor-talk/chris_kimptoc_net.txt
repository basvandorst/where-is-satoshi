I am trying to setup Tor on an Ubuntu box, but getting a little glitch
on the install - hope this is the correct list to query...
I followed the instructions from here:
In particular:
Then add this line to your /etc/apt/sources.list file:
deb       main
where you put the codename of your distribution (i.e. etch, lenny,
sid, maverick, lucid, karmic, jaunty, intrepid, hardy or whatever it
is) in place of .
Then add the gpg key used to sign the packages by running the
following commands at your command prompt:
gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv 886DDD89
I found and installed the package ok, but the gpg line fails - doesnt
seem to get to keys.gnupg.net.
Is that still current, or is the server just down for now and I should
try later...
Thanks in advance,

Thanks, I see the site was up this earlier, but the gpg call still
failed (using gpg 1.4.10)
Have written a loop to keep trying to grab it...
