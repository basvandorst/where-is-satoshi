Not sure your question is for what this list is about but anyway below
are a few "safe" ones I recommend to using, "secure" I guess depends on
how much you trust the unknown party running the server.
# Swiss Privacy Foundation DNS
# Censurfridns Denmark
# freedns
# Digitalcourage e.V.
# Chaos Computer Club
The list above can be found at this link:
Hope that helps a little.

I agree with Cecilia on this.
These are serious allegations but,
Allegations are not equal to Convictions.
Should this man not have the right to a fair trial?
The tor project is not about throwing someones rights out the window.
We all have opinions and are free to share them, but it is irresponsible
to publicly defame and bash someone without that person having the
chance to defend themselves in a court of law, no matter how much of a
prick they are.
If there was wrong doing and if Jacob is guilty or not is for a court to

@_subject: [tor-talk] Any updates from Tor Project on ioerror? 
Nice speech, it looks like you put some time and effort in to it but
it would make a lot more sense to make a case against someone by
presenting factual evidence against that person and not trying to make
absurd comparisons on a mailing list between two things that have
almost nothing in common.
Jacob Appelbaum has the ability to accept or deny these allegations,
if he denies them then a court can find him guilty (and give him an
adequate punishment) or the can find him innocent but all of this is
based on evidence. Really do not think your long winded speeches and
obvious hatred for this is proving anything.
Anyway I respect your opinion no matter how funny and absurd I find it be.
Can we not just move on to other topics? This guy is not even with the
Tor project anymore.

It would be nice if you could recommend something.
Answering the topic, Riseup is a webmail provider that functions well
with Tor.  I use Riseup but my personal favorite is Sigaint and
recommend that.

I can understand your copy and paste an article you find on the internet
thing one time maybe even twice but you have now done this multiple times.
With all due respect, why don't you just paste the link to the article
and make an original comment or opinion about it?  Just seems like it is
laziness on your part to copy and paste entire articles on this mailing
list and just have nothing more to say.
I respect your feelings and all but I don't know just seems like you are
spamming this list.

I am very sad to hear that Cecilia. Let "educational purposes" be karma.
I am sure there are too many to count.
I guess for some people when they have no arguments they just resort
to unfounded verbal attacks.

Well yeah assuming I am careless about how I do things and for that
they can identify who I am.
I do not think I need to say that there are a myriad of ways to
monitor and spy on someone especially when the desire exists to do it.
Does it matter where the accounts are located?  You still have to
trust the provider. Anyway XKEYSCORE should not be a problem when the
information you decide to send out in to the wild is handled properly.
Looks like your "general rule" is a hard one to obey am I right?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Can we have less of Jacob Appelbaum here, please? 
Agreed Mirimir, it is VERY difficult to avoid or ignore talking about
someone who at the time of there collaboration with the tor project was
allegedly involved in some type of "sexual misconduct".
Just for the record:
Actually I asked 5 days ago, on this list, I asked with all due respect
if we could "just move on to other topics" the reason was because I
thought all the comments that were being made were out of line and not
very constructive. Why did no one follow suite then? How convenient now
that all the Appelbaum bashing has taken place, the real facts come out
they are all now tired.
I just ignored much of it. If someone else is tired the might be lazy
for simply filtering or just deleting threads they do not like, another
option is that they could also just unsubscribe and go to sleep.
