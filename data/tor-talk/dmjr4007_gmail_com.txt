A few months back I ran into the same problem.  I ended up using V3  dir servers.

Do you access your website across the internet?  Do you have any  exclusions in your proxy setting?

Maybe one day somebody will actually try to analyze this.

@_subject: Tor On Private Network 
I am trying to run Tor on an internal network and I seem to be having  a problem with the Directory Server.  The Directory Server starts up  but I am seeing the following message in notices.log:
Sep 02 20:44:28.840 [notice] While fetching directory info, no running  dirservers known. Will try again later. (purpose 14)
Any idea what that means?  Also, should I set the Directory Server's  "DirServer" to point to itself or do I need to run mulitple Dir  Servers and point them to each other?  Here's the configuration file I  am using:
Nickname Me
ContactInfo root at localhost
Address 192.168.2.7
ORPort 9001
DirAllowPrivateAddresses 1
EnforceDistinctSubnets 0
AssumeReachable 1
AuthoritativeDirectory 1
V2AuthoritativeDirectory 1
DirPort 9030
RunAsDaemon 1
DirServer Me 192.168.2.7:9030 5B99 9839 164F 52CB FA8C ACC0 1A70 7E1B  CB7E A9B5
 Me 127.0.0.1:1 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  Log notice file /home/test/notices.log

Thanks, I'll give it a try.  I have no preference as to what directory  version I use.

Wouldn't the throughput of your server depend on the nodes up and  downstream of it?

@_subject: Issue creating a private tor network 
When I was first trying to build a private tor network, I found that  it took a few hours for the directory servers and routers to start  communicating.  So try starting all of the directory servers and  routers and then leave them alone for a few hours and see if  everything starts working.

Go to  and compare the reported ip address  with your assigned addressed.

Look at the line in the config file containing the Socks listener  entry and see if you added an extra character after the port number.
