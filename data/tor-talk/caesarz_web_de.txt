@_subject: own circuit =?ISO-8859-15?Q?f=FCr_each_tcp_connection?= 
torspec says:
To open a new anonymized TCP connection, the OP chooses an open
  circuit to an exit that may be able to connect to the destination
  address, selects an arbitrary StreamID not yet used on that circuit,
  and constructs a RELAY_BEGIN cell with a payload encoding the address
  and port of the destination host.
so this is how tcp connections are "createt".
now my question is
can you configure tor in that way, that f?r eacht tcp connection an own circuit is createt, so that each tcp connection got a different exit node (with a different IP) ???
