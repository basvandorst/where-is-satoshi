By default your bridge is submitted to the bridge-db. Distribution is
via bridges.torproject.org and emailing bridges at torproject.org, as well
as whoever you tell to use your bridge. (Someone please correct me if
I'm missing something here)

I wouldn't recommend using a rPi for a Tor bridge/relay. It's far too underpowered in my mind to be useful for anyone. If anything, it might harm the network by introducing slow hops. A spare computer or a VPS would be better here. As far as your bandwidth settings those seem fine, you should be able to see connections taking place in arm if the relay is functioning.

Hash: SHA512
Hey Alec,
I'm one of the developers on darkweb-everywhere. I was playing around
with having fbcdn.net redirect to
fbcdn23dssr3jqnq.onion with a rule, hoping to cover instances where
people have linked directly to images from Facebook.
Since the cert Facebook is using doesn't have a wildcard subdomain for
the hidden services, the user is presented with a mismatched exception
error. Obviously this isn't intended so I figured I would reach out to
you about this :)
Here is the example I used [0][1] I included both the original link
and the redirected one. This was found by searching for site:fbcdn.net
on Reddit and picking the first non-broken safe for work image I could
find (this was surprisingly hard!).
I'm not too familiar with how Facebook handles these links, or if this
is even expected behavior. It seems the fix should just be reissuing
the cert with a wildcard flag, but I could be wrong. Any ideas?
I'm cc'ing tor-talk on this email since I figured more users reading
this can't be a bad thing.

Re: Tor Browser Speed -- your Tor connection is only as fast as the slowest hop. The bottleneck most likely isn't your home ISP, but one of the relays in your Tor circuit. Jan was saying you should consider donating bandwidth and becoming a Tor relay. Anonymity works well in numbers :)

Thank you for doing this! I'm glad to see a site as huge as facebook has decided to start implementing a HS for their users.

I was actually going to suggest that idea Griffin, you beat me to it :)
I like the idea of another State of the Onion address like last year's
talk (a LOT more has been written about Tor in the past few months
alone), or Damian's suggestion of another Tor ecosystem talk. There
are a lot more projects that use Tor now than in 2012, that could use
the publicity!
Is it too much to ask for both of these talks at 31c3? ;)

I like how a couple of the alternatives to "Tor" in this article are
Tails and Whonix. What do they use for anonymity again? Oh yeah, Tor...
They also list Disconnect and Tox as an alternative, and then quickly
say they aren't alternatives. I'd say this writer was hoping for clickbait.

Happy to say I sent some BTC over to Werner (as well as OTR, Tor, i2p, and a few other pieces of privacy software) the day before Jacob and Laura's talk at 31c3. Was a great feeling to see that the money I donated went to a tool that works :) With free software we own our means of production, but we also need to make sure these projects have the love and care they require to continue to protect people. I think we should add Enigmail to the list of projects that can use some love too. A ton of people use it (Glenn Greenwald in particular IIRC), and it's recommended by so many as the goto for "easy" to use email with GPG. The easier it is to work with, and the more secure it is, the better it is for all of us in the long run.

You mean like what we've been doing over on
 :)
The above tool (granted I have a *very* clear bias) is why I am not a
fan of the "make a hidden service be a reverse proxy to another
website". I'm not comfortable with transferring expected ownership of a
website for a number of reasons, which is is why we try to vet every
site included.
I'm very big on asking websites, especially those that are censored, to
run a hidden service as a way to protect their users and as a way to
make them more censor resistant. I think the lack of interest has
started to go away now that Blockchain and Facebook have implemented
one, since I haven't been getting the usial "Well we don't block Tor..."
response. Maybe we can get a big news organization to run one for a
proof of concept?

I missed the "performed in conjunction

I'm wondering if a few from the community should take part in a nagging effort? I'd gladly throw some time of mine into helping get more hidden services. Any takers?

After an update to the TBB, the extension is reverted back to HTTPSE.
It's not ideal, but dwe itself is a bit of a hack.
I've written up an example email here:
Feel free to improve on it, I based it off of emails I've sent in the
past. I'm not sure if we should list security concerns in the general
sense, or if we should point to a real life example of where a hidden
service was utilized for security reasons.

If I'm not mistaken, DuckDuckGo used to run an exit enclave but ended up moving over to a hidden service. Not sure if their reasons for moving over to a HS were documented in the same way as their exit enclave blog.

Sadly Twitter seems to have been enforcing this over the past year[0] or
so, and there doesn't seem to be an end in sight. IIRC, Twitter tries to
do this in an attempt to try and curtail perceived abuse and/or trolls
from using Twitter as a platform, but they go about it in the worst way
possible. The hashtag  has been used by several members of
the community (including devs) to voice their complaints about Twitter
doing this, but as you can see nothing has improved. Does anyone on this list has contacts in Twitter who might be open to
talking with the community, can you ask them to join this list? I really
would love to see this issue resolved along with my account not being
locked out. [0]: [1]:

Heh, did not know about these, bookmarking in case of emergency. For
what it's worth, I think Google Voice also used to give out a free phone
number for a while, but I can't remember if they are still doing this.
It's been a few years since I've used that service.
I was thinking that someone might know the the equivalent of Alec
Muffet at Twitter. Someone who might be able help from the inside with
lobbying for Tor-tolerant or Tor-embracing policies at Twitter. Of
course this will still be a slow, uphill, and painful battle to try to
have someone listen...

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor-relay-bootstrap -- automated setup for a Tor bridge, 
Hi all!
Wrapped up a mini-project of mine a few hours ago, which was a
re-working of Micah Lee's tor-relay-bootstrap script. The main
improvements I've added are making it work on Debian Jessie, merging in
_NSAKEY's tor-bridge-bootstrap fork, along with adding options to set up
your server to be a bridge, relay, or exit (with the appropriate
iptables rules).
I've tested the script out on a blank Jessie box I have here and can
confirm it works with all three options, but would love some additional
testing. I'm not a programmer by trade so if anyone has any ideas on how
to improve it feel free to put in an issue or pull request. I have a few
ideas that I've written down in the README file as to how I'd like to
see the script progress but would love to hear more suggestions.
