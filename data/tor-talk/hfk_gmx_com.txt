@_subject: Installation problem (fingerprint, could not bind to port 9050)  
Upon installing and a running the latest tor server (OSX 10.4), I get  the following message in notices.log:
Jun 26 12:52:22.326 [notice] Tor 0.1.0.10 opening log file.
Jun 26 12:52:22.326 [notice] Initialized libevent version 1.1a using  method poll
Jun 26 12:52:22.328 [warn] connection_create_listener(): Could not  bind to port 9050: Address already in use
Jun 26 12:52:22.329 [err] options_act(): Failed to bind one of the  listener ports.
Jun 26 12:52:22.329 [err] init_from_config(): Acting on config  options left us in a broken state. Dying.
Tor also fails to create a fingerprint file in /Library/Tor/var/lib/tor.
Note that I uncommented the following lines in the torrc file:
ORPort 9001
DirPort 9030
SocksPort 9050
SocksBindAddress 127.0.0.1
Port forwarding is enabled for all of the above ports. The server is  visible to the world through dyndns.
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Hanno
