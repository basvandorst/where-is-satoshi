@_subject: [tor-talk] unregister exit relay - how to 
Hi to all,
Few days ago I have tried to setup an exit relay on my home laptop ..
with great success :)
The bad part is after seeing my external ip address published to the
world on atlas or globe I have discovered I cannot access anymore to
some site with my payed premium login credential because the sites
policy don't allow  access from the tor network even if I don't use a
tor client to browse the net. :(
For this reason I stopped my exit relay, but to solve the problem I
need to unregister my external ip from the public list as well.
How can I do that?
The relay id is: relisys
Someone can help me please?
P Please consider the environment before printing this e-mail

Yes you are right, now I know.
My ip is dynamic but is changed quite rarely, and reboot the router
99% of the times doesn't affect it.
That's is why I'm looking for a different approach.
