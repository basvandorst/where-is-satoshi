@_subject: [tor-talk] tor relay and raspberry pi 
Is it possible to operate a tor relay on a dedicated raspberry pi?
Is it safe to leave the raspberry pi connected constantly to a
broadband internet router?
What can a novice do to maximise legitimate use of a tor relay by the public?

An error was received, although connected to the tor network, the
firefox profile could not be loaded.
Tor does not seem compatible with firefox profile manager ( which I
use). How to change this behaviour?
Also, independent open of firefox does not make use of tor network

Have just discovered that needed to change permissions for the
torbrowser directory, i.e.
chown -R r /usr/local/torbrowser
Isn't it possible to have configuration settings reserved in the
users' home directories?

It is a common linux hierarchy file system for programs to be
installed system wide (/usr/bin/, /usr/lib, etc) and user
configurations stored in the home directory.
The linux installation instructions do not state that installation
must be made in a directory with normal-user permissions

The documentation should make this declaration and not assume user
knowledge. For the benefit of others, please consider to change the
installation advice accordingly

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor browser bundle uninstalled 
For some unknown reason, after installing an extension, the firefox
browser failed to start with the tor network activated. The error log
stated something about a port process being open.
Anyway, the tor browser directory was > 250 mb, considered excessive
and therefore removed. As alternative, tor is activated from a command
terminal and the existing installation of firefox is used with the
plugin 'foxyproxy' basic. According to  the web site
'whatismyipaddress'  the tor network is being successfully used. Tor
is killed at the command terminal using 'ctrl + c'.
