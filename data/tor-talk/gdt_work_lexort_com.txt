@_subject: [tor-talk] To Toggle, or not to Toggle: The End of Torbutton 
The reason I am discussing this in so much detail here is because I
  believe there is a chance that there are users out there who rely on
  the toggle model and/or their OS Firefox build, and may be confused or
  enraged by the new model. I'm asking this list to get an idea of how
  many of those users there are, and to try to understand what the
  overall costs of this sort of migration are.
It's not clear to me how your proposal relates to other-than-Linux.
I'm using firefox on NetBSD/i386.  I don't understand how this "Tor
Browser Bundle" will appear and be integrated into the OS packaging
system.  Will it be a renamed copy of firefox, requiring twice the
packaging effort?  Or very close to existing firefox?  It seems that it
has been difficult to get fixes upstream to firefox; there are currently
66 patches to xulrunner sitting in pkgsrc.
Or is this a firefox-tor that uses the same xulrunner?  I would, without
understanding, expect that the hard issues are in xulrunner.
I don't find the notion of installing tor and then adding torbutton to
be at all confusing.
I can certainly see your point about toggling being difficult.   I don't
know if a plugin that makes you restart the browser after changing to
Tor mode would be a big simplification and avoid the bugs.   I would
find that to be a great solution, as browser restarts are very fast and
have no software maintenance/packaging issues.
Reading your note, it sounds like the basic issue is unwilling of the
firefox team to take and deploy bugfixes you think are important for
security/privacy.  After all, if you can fix them in a fork, the issue
is about not wanting them, or finding the usefulness/cleanliness ratio
not high enough.  Is that a fair characterization?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Torbutton 1.4.1 Released 
I'm running NetBSD (and there is no TBB for that platform, only
linux/mac/windows).   I don't see sources to build TBB in the
distribution either.  So please consider this a "didn't work for me"
report for TBB :-)
It's really unfortunate that (I presume) mozilla is uninterested in
applying the privacy leak fixes upstream.  But there are 74 patches in
the pkgsrc build, and that's a clue.
It's possible that [the TBB patch to firefox, presumably?] could get
added to the default build of firefox for pkgsrc, presuming it doesn't
change behavior adversely for non-Tor use.

I found the sources:
   (it might be nice to have src/ directory alongside the OS-specific
versions), and will ask the other pkgsrc folks if someone is up to
packaging it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] GNU make required? 
Someone updated the pkgsrc entry for tor to 0.2.2.32, and on NetBSD/i386
5.1ish it failed to build.  The complaint was about not knowing how to
build libtor.a.  Switching to GNU make (from BSD make, which is 'make')
resulted in a build which seems to work (and passes make check).
The documentation:
  doesn't say that GNU make is required.  So please let me know if this is
a documentation bug, or if a more detailed build log showing the failure
with BSD make is desired.  (0.2.1.30 builds fine with BSD make, so this
seems like a regression.)
I am not immediately able to explain what the problem is.

@_subject: [tor-talk] GNU make required? 
The build worked with the make in NetBSD-current.  So perhaps there's a
bug in 5.1's make, or perhaps there's something subtly odd in the

@_subject: [tor-talk] Deterministic builds? 
We believe that Windows and Mac OS X both produce build results that are
  extremely difficult to verify. On Gnu/Linux sometimes the build results
  are difficult to verify.
I am not crystal clear on all the details, but NetBSD has recently
undergone a perhaps-similar effort, with the goal being that one should
be able to start with identical sources and get bit-identical binary
Key elements include:
  Using a toolchain that is part of the source tree.
  Modifying the toolchain to not embed timestamps.
  Cleaning up everyplace else that allowed variation.
But, that was a regression-test mentality effort, and I think you are
talking about a security effort, to detect subversion of platforms used
for the build.  Still, if everyone can checkout a given tag, and produce
the same bits, and compare hashes, a lot of benefit is gained - is that
your goal?

@_subject: [tor-talk] reply-to: list surprising on a privacy-centric list 
I just sent a private reply to a posting here.  I was surprised that
reply began to compose a message to the list instead of to the
individual sender as it should have, but did notice in time.  The
problem of course is the Reply-To: header that points to the list.
I know there are pro and anti list reply-to camps.  In my view, the
biggest problem with list reply-to is that people using MUAs as they
were designed can easily intend to send a private reply and instead have
it posted to the world.  That is a serious privacy bug, and it's
surprising that the tor list is set up this way, since TBB etc. goes to
great lengths to prevent privacy-leak mistakes.
(I noticed the problem on the gmane gateway, but public archives of the
list show the header too.  Sorry if this is fixed already and also a bug
in gmane and I'm wrongly ranting.)

I've put up some graphical world maps of the tor user to internet
  population per country ratio. Tor user statistics are from

  country data from the world factbook site (latest data set is from 2009).
  To cut a long story short, here's the url: It would be nice if the colors had numbers associated with them; right
now it's a floating scale and I can't even tell if it changes month to

@_subject: [tor-talk] Building Petnames with DNSSEC...? 
My take is that [hex].onion is not really a domain name, but an address
in a new address family for a different protocol, which has then been
stuck into a domain name.
So the technically right thing to do, all practical considerations
aside, is to define a new family, analagous to A and AAAA, perhaps TOR,
and put in "IN TOR" records with [hex] as the RHS.
I think other choices are about trying to implement that semantics with
as few changes to infrastructure as possible.
