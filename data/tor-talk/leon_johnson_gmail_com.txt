If you don't want to run as an exit node, your torrc file is correctly
configured. You can always check one of the TorStatus websites:
 (usually updated after an hour or so). Do a
search for your IP or Nickname. In your case, you should *not* see an image
of a small door.
On a side note, have you considered running as a bridge?

Yes to grossly oversimplify bridges are "semi-visible" entrance ramps to
Tor. The limitation of bridges is directly tied to how many ISPs filter
your traffic.
Case in point: If one small ISP blocks the IP of your relay, you probably
won't notice. If 3-4 "major" ISPs block your relay, you'll likely see a
drop in Tor traffic.
As far a which relay types are in demand, that's a different:
If I had to guess I'd say:
Stock Relay
Someone else may be better suited to answer that inquiry however :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why my relay doesn't get any traffic and doesn't 
You should see indication of Tor's self-test in the log file you specified
(/var/log/tor). If you don't see a log file or an empty log file, I would
lean toward a configuration issue.
If the logs indicated that the self-test has successfully completed as
Roman mentioned, you may just have to wait. New relays don't get much
traffic at first.
A new relay, assuming it is reliable and has plenty of bandwidth, goes

@_subject: [tor-talk] Blocking of Tor relay IP address 
I have a static IP for my exit relay. But I still manage that IP address's
"reputation" online. Is that something that you've considered or is it off
the table?
