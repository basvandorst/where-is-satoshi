@_subject: Why does TOR stream data when it&#8217;s not in use? 
Hi, I’m new to TOR. I’ve been using it for some weeks for
online privacy. I’ve installed TOR and Privoxy from the latest
Windows Vidalia Bundle and configured my Internet Explorer 7 manually.
Everything seems to work fine when I test my connection on such testing
sites on the internet. My question is: When I start Privoxy and TOR, my
computer starts immediately to stream data over the internet. It mostly
downloads, and sometimes it downloads 1MB of data each minute, or more,
for a long while. It also sends data, but in a much lower rate. This
seems to be strange, because I don’t have any active internet
application running - and as soon as I shut down the TOR engine, the
streaming stops. The reason for me looking at this as strange or
suspicious is because sometimes this happens and sometime it
doesn’t when I start the TOR engine. Sometimes I just need to shut
it down and restart it, and after a new circuit is made, the connection
is inactive unless I start to use internet application, such as browsing
the web. Why does this happen?
Is every TOR user a TOR Server or Exit Node as well? Thanks in advance,
Greetings from Norway
