@_subject: [tor-talk] Attack through tor bad for all 
Hash: SHA256
Sadly, an attack run through tor destined for a uk2 hosting provider is
being met with a null routes for exit nodes under a policy of "wont' be
lifting it any time soon". The group owns several brands spanning data
centers in a variety of areas and continents. Although not super eager
about allowing tor exit nodes on their networks the group and it's
brands have allowed them so long as DMCA volume isn't a problem. Some
operators have limited those issues via exit policies to certain ports.
As everybody knows, the problem with running the attack through tor is,
aside from being ineffective in the long run, endangering the viability
of hosting exits on their networks as well as accessing content hosted
on their networks from tor. This threat is not new news but I wish to
point it out this method is probably not resolving your grievances and
it's problematic for those who are otherwise unaffiliated with your
actions. Many network providers are in this situation where abuse
through tor ends up hurting the tor community by limiting where exits
can exist and what content on their networks can be seen through tor.
To the initiator of the traffic which they are not receiving any more, I
hope you find a way to resolve your beef without harming the network
that you depend upon. I'm sorry you feel this is your best option and I
hope that when this is over that their sizable client base isn't totally
dark to tor. It would be nice to be able to utilize their geographically
diverse networks for precious exit nodes that we all benefit from. I'd
like to help find a better option for everyone involved.
