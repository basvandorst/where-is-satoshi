Not sure if that has been discussed yet... the site  torbundlebrowser.org is a almost perfect copy of the TOR webpage and  has a TBB download which has malware in it. (down at the moment)

@_subject: [tor-talk] TCP Stealth - Improved Kernel-Based Port-Knocking in 
This work could be of interest for the TOR project.
"TCP Stealth replaces the traditional random TCP SQN number with a token
that authenticates the client and (optionally) the first bytes of the TCP
payload. Clients and servers can enable TCP Stealth by explicitly setting
a socket option or linking against a library that wraps existing network
system calls."
"Finally, applications that try to enable users to cicrumvent  censorship ?such as Tor bridges [5]? may want to hide their existence  from scans by censors."

@_subject: [tor-talk] Clearnet/Onion access  for website 
I have already a web server running to serve clearnet and I want to  provide access to the same site on the same machine via onion service.  What is the easiest way to do so?
