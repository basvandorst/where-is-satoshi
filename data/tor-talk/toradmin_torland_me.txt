What about a Firefox/Chromium addon, that bundles tor client to access hidden services? This could improve usability for an average user.

Hi Hans R?diger,
I am concerned too, that there are malicious exit servers out there. That is one of the reasons why I operate Exits. To make it less probable that the malicious ones get the traffic.
Best regards,

This sounds to me like an error that justifies to withdraw 0.2.4.14-alpha completely or to prevent any 0.2.4.14-alpha relay to get the guard flag in

in October I tried to access the blog of Neelie Kroes with Tor browser. Neelie Kroes is Vice-President of the European Commission and responsible for the Digital Agenda for Europe. At that time she asked the public in her blog about their views: Using the Tor browser the access to the site was blocked with this message:
Access Denied
Your request has been denied for security reason.
If you believe that this request should not be blocked, please contact EC DIGIT SNet snet at ec.europa.eu.
If your request is urgent, please contact also the service helpdesk (+32)2 29 58181. An email to snet at ec.europa.eu and the office of Neelies Kroes seems to have helped. In the mean time it is possible again to access the European Commission web site  from the Tor network.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question about something said about Tor in the Der 
My understanding is that they watch the traffic between tor client and guard and what is coming out of the exit node. If you are running a tor relay at home they cannot destinguish your tor client traffic from the relay traffic, so traffic correlation does not work for them.

Does it make sense to still recommend 0.2.4.X-alpha/rc client versions now that 0.2.4 is stable? Or am I misunderstanding the notice.

Sebastian, thanks for clarification. I remember there were some late changes     and  which made it into 2.4.X because of the DOS issues Rob Jansen described in Would it not be better to bring relays to a version that have defenses against these new attacks? Thanks & regards,

Just received this message from EFF. I am happy to see joined forces of such a powerful coalition. ----------  Forwarded Message  ----------
Dear XXX,
Democratic activists, whistleblowers, and journalists all over the world rely on Tor to shield their identities when they use the Internet. It?s software that helps Internet users protect their anonymity and circumvent censorship. When you use Tor, your real IP address remains hidden from the sites you visit
?and anybody else who might be eavesdropping.
Tor is strong code. It?s one of the few technologies reported to thwart the National Security Agency's passive surveillance practices. But Tor can only exist because of an international network of volunteers running relays.
Today the Electronic Frontier Foundation, The Tor Project, the Free Software Foundation, and the Freedom of the Press Foundation are launching a joint campaign to encourage Internet users all over the world to support the Tor network by operating relays.
We need volunteers. The more Tor relays we have running, the faster and more secure the Tor network becomes. Want to help out? Join us: The Tor network is actively under attack. Documents released by Edward Snowden show that government agencies are spending lots of time and money trying to find ways to hack or get around Tor. From what we've seen, the NSA techniques revealed in those documents are unable to defeat the underlying structure of the network. Instead, the documents show that agencies have been forced to turn to other incidental vulnerabilities to entrap Tor users, for example by exploiting bugs in browsers and other software.
Tor remains a powerful tool against surveillance by the NSA and other government agencies. But it can only be that strong if there is a diverse, committed network of volunteers donating bandwidth to the network. Please join us in creating that future for Tor.
How to get involved: We?ve created a detailed legal FAQ about Tor [ and The Tor Project has a guide for setting up a Tor relay [
relay.html.en]. Once you?re running a Tor relay, register your relay on our campaign page [
Already running a Tor relay? This is a great moment to increase the bandwidth of your relay. Existing relays can participate by adding at least 128 KB/s to your RelayBandwidthRate and RelayBandwidthBurst, and registering on our site.
Not ready to run a Tor relay? That?s OK. The Freedom of the Press Foundation has suggestions for other ways to help support Tor: Resetting the Net. Our campaign is part of a larger movement of digital rights activists across the world working to make surveillance more difficult. It?s called Reset the Net.
