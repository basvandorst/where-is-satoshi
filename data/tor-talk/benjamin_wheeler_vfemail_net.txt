@_subject: [tor-talk] Using the middle relay to guard against correlation 
First off I'm not a computer scientist. Nor am I a Tor expert.
I'm wondering if it is possible to use the middle relay as a buffer to  protect against possible correlation attacks.
 From my understanding, if the attacker controls the first relay, and  the last relay, she can transmit packets at a certain burst rate, and  size to generate a visible pattern that can be detected at the other  Unless the middle relay interferes in reshaping that pattern.
So what if in creating the circuit, the client would ask the middle  relay to buffer the traffic at a certain buffer size and at a certain  timer variable? The timer variable is used in the case the buffer does  not fill up.
So when the middle relay receives incoming or outgoing traffic for  that circuit, it would buffer the data until the buffer is full, then  transmit, or until the timeout of the timer has elapsed since first  bits of data started to buffer then transmit.
We make the client request from the middle relay to allocate the  buffer size and timer in milliseconds, and if they are both 0, then  the relay behaves as normal as it is currently.
We also can make the relay set it's own parameters on what the max  buffer size should be and max timer variable allowed. If the client  circuit creator is asking for too much, or inconsistent values, either  give the defined relay max, or ignore, or send back an error to the  Is something like that possible to implement in Tor? Does TCP allow  it? How well will it scale?
