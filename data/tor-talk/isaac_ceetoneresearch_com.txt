@_subject: Fwd: (Theory) The BGP exploit: Effects on Tor routing and overall anonymity? 
Hi All,
I'm sorry for the cross-post, but I felt this was relevant (and an  interesting thread!).
Alex Pilosov (one of the presenters for this BGP exploit) hangs out on  our list, so I cross posted this thread to the NYC*BUG-talk list, and  below is Alex's short response.
(For the record, the NYC*BUG Talk mailing list and archives can be  found at: )
