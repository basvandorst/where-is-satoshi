Quoting 7v5w7go9ub0o <7v5w7go9ub0o at gmail.com>:
Sorry, I didn't get it: in case I'm using Thunderbird and Torbutton,  and connect to the smtp server trough tor. Will my "real" ip adress  occur in the mail headers, or the ip of the exit node?
I'm guessing the ip of the exit node, right? Because if not, it would  be senseless to use tor? Would be great if someone could clarify this!
Merci! :)

I would suggest that people who want to discuss about 9/11 conspiracy  theories and other stuff thats has nothing to do with TOR may leave  this mailinglist, and continue their discussion on other lists or  trough direct mails to each other.
Please don't use this list for discussion about bla and software  licensing and other non-tor-related stuff. Its annoying!!!

Riseup, the other tech collectives named on the website of riseup and  many (could someone confirm this, is "many" correct?) universities are  using a technique called StartTLS. You may find more information here:  [1] & [2]
So, for example, if you are sending a mail from riseup to nadir.org, a  tech collective located in Hamburg / Germany, you _can't_ read the  subject, the message itself, and the sender and receiver from  "outside", which means for example if your are wiretapping the  Of course this isn't 100% secure, and yes it can be attacked, and it  doesn't work if you send a mail to hotmail or other shitty mail  providers. But maybe better than send all the traffic unencrypted  trough the net.
Just my 0.02, idefix :)
P.S.: I will add a part of a mail header using TLS. Mail came from  so36.net, tech collective located in Berlin / Germany, and was  distributed to riseup. And sorry for my bad english...

Hash: SHA1
Hi folks!
I'm running Debian testing i386. I update my system on a daily basis
using aptitude.
I added the noreply.org repository to my sources.list, and afterwards
installed tor with "aptitude install tor".
I followed the instructions given on tor.eff.org about editing the
configs after the installation.
I'm browsing the web with Firefox 3.0.3 and the newest versions of
NoScript and TorButton.
Now I was testing my setup at torcheck.xenobite.eu, and all is looking
great so far. However, the second "Your current FQDN" is not green, but
instead yellow. It says "Lookup/reverse NOT correct". What does this
mean, and is this dangerous?
I think so, because it would be better if its green, right?
Has this something to do with resolving of domain names, which means
that they don't go trough tor, but instead directly to the net?
Fast help would be really appreciated! Thanks so much!

I think it was a chinese one, "Unwatched" or something like this.
Doesn't remember exactly!
Anyway, you're right: I restarted tor several times and all the other
exits were "green", so its seems that this chinese exit node wasn't
setup correctly.
Thanks for your help!
