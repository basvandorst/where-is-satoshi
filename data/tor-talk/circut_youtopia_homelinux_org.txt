@_subject: Setting up a Hidden Service on Mac OS X 
Perhaps this may be of some value to you.
I've never actually seen the code, but mabey there's something
in it on how to hide a process on the mac?
Hope that helps.

@_subject: ATTN: for-profit Tor operators 
Mabey we should call all individuals who would be willing to participate, Pool our programming skills, C / PHP / Python / java even and write an app we could sell as a p2p client, Have special tor tweaks to optimize it for the p2p protocol we define.
I think it sounds quite interesting.. a bit unethical mabey, but at least it could be marketed as something to guarantee the RIAA wont be  kicking your door in.
Any thoughts?

Run ethereal or tcpdump and capture whats going across the wire on port 9030, then
mabey submit this to the list, as I'd be interested to see what it would need to download as well....
Does your box function as a Tor server? Or just a Tor node?

But we all know it will just be a matter of time before the
bill gets 'ammended' to include it. Hopefully this will be
shot down, and the government will leave well enough alone.

@_subject: Prioritizing from source ip? 
Hey guys. I've been running my tor router for about 6 months now, and my
only grip thus far is that my bandwith allocated for the month gets
consumed in about 2 weeks. As you all know, once the bandwith is
consumed, tor hibernates. I was just wondering if there's a facility in
place to allow a certain source ip (or two) to *ALWAYS* be allowed, and
mabey even to have a higher priority than say someone in .jp...
Does such a facility exist? I realize that I could use iptables an tor
to do this by setting my tor bandwith limit for to to say 100gb / month, and
setup iptables to stop allowing connections from everyone else but my
ip when the rate hits 50gb. Therefor locking out everyone else, and
alloting me an extra 50gb...
Any better ideas?

@_subject: Lots of errors in logs (>300mb) 
Hey guys, I'm running tor-0.1.0.16 on linux. I'm running an onion router on my box, and I'm seeing alot of these errors in my tor.log:
Jan 30 00:25:30.735 [notice] onion_pending_add(): Already have 100
onions queued. Closing.
Jan 30 00:25:30.735 [warn] command_process_create_cell(): Failed to hand
off onionskin. Closing.
These were filling my logs up like crazy, so I just removed those log lines from the code and recompiled. Just wanted to know if there was a better facility for limiting those
logs. I can't imagine those log entries being anything serious right?

Good guess. I'm running on a 2.8ghz Celeron, but my exit policy was
flawed I believe. I've since fixed it, I hope.

@_subject: Hidden service question 
Hey guys, I was curios about the hidden service feature of tor. If I run say a webserver as a hidden service, does the webserver see the source IP address of the person getting content from my site? Or are
both ends (ORIGINAL source and dest IP) hidden from eachother?
Thanks in advance.

@_subject: TOR traffic measurement with iptables 
Since your running linux, you might check out ntop. I'm using it with a Tor protocol definition. Ntop is a bit
bloated, but if your monitoring alot of services besides
tor, it may be worth it.

Boo!! I'm not on that list! ;<
How are these hosts determined? And is it something in the
Tor protocol that distinguishes the Operating system?

@_subject: memory usage slowly rising 
Nice graphs. Can't help with the memory issue, but about the hosting company, I've been using serverpronto(.com) for about 9 months now, with the tor node running (allocating 70gb / mo) for about 7 of those months
and haven't had a single call from the provider. I've been very happy
with them, only problem is expansions (RAM / hd space) cost you ;<

Nah, I run the following exit policy:
ExitPolicy      reject *:25,reject *:587,reject *:110,reject
*:143,reject *:6880-6890, reject *:873, reject *:6300-6400, accept *:*
Allowing everything out except p2p and email stuff. I got nothing against using bittorrent through tor, but
it drinks the bandwith like my car drinks gas.
