I want to understand the best torification tool to use, but it's really hard to learn about what each tool is and how it is different and who is responsible for which tool.  Various places on torproject.org site talk about torify, usewithtor, torsocks, etc.
First, this page says torsocks is installed when tor is installed but this is NOT true, at least not from the yum repository that is run by torproject.org:
       The only thing I get is torify. Without tsocks or torsocks, torify doesn't even make sense!
So I wind up on google code trying to understand about torsocks.
There is no documentation on the web explaining what/who/when/how usewithtor is different than torsocks.  It's quite confusing.  The only place I found something was the usewithtor manpage. That's nice, but this info should be on the web.
However, the manpage for usewithtor says "usewithtor  runs  torsocks(1)  with  the  default  configuration  file, located at /usr/local/etc/torsocks.conf.  Running torsocks(1) directly means that no configuration  file  will  be  used..." If you read the torsocks manpage, it says "If  TORSOCKS_CONF_FILE is not set, torsocks will attempt to read the configuration file at /usr/local/etc/torsocks.conf"
So which manpage is correct? If the torsocks manpage is correct, then usewithtor serves no purpose because it indicates its only purpose is to run torsocks with that config file, right? So why not make sure torsocks works like its manpage says it does and REMOVE usewithtor? End the confusion please!
Back to torify which comes with Tor itself, now I have all three wrapper scripts installed. I don't know which to use. I wish there was just one because they all do the same thing from a newb perspective. If torify comes with Tor, is that the most reliable one to use? On the other hand, Tor does NOT come with torsocks so if you install that you get the other wrappers anyway. HELP!

As soon as I figure it out myself! :)
OK, but why does Tor deliver torify if that's the case?
But what's the use of usewithtor if the torsocks manpage is correct? (see my question above) (my torsocks.conf is exactly where those manpages say it is)

No, torsocks also has a wrapper script by the same name.  And if the manpage for torsocks (the wrapper) is correct, it makes usewithtor redundant. I have no idea why the author created two of the same script. Looks like Maxim agrees, usewithtor should be removed.
That would be great
Can anyone make a layperson explanation of this issue? If I run an application through torsocks, who exactly has to initiate the ipv6 traffic to cause the problem? I don't think I have any apps that use ipv6??
So it would be great if torproject took it
oh :( then I hope the author or someone else motivated can revive torsocks because there are many people who want to use it!

Are you sure TORSOCKS_CONF_FILE because most of the man pages I read say TORSOCKS_CONFFILE???
I was questioning why this defaults to 4. I know torsocks is supposed to force DNS resolution through Tor, but SOCKS4 doesn't support resolution. But it doesn't mention if its really SOCKS4a. So I changed it to 5 like you, but why the default 4?

Sorry, correction - man 8 torsocks (for the library not the script) mentions TORSOCKS_CONFFFILE, but all the other manpages mention TORSOCKS_CONF_FILE

@_subject: [tor-talk] What is 127.0.69.0? 
I happened to see some hidden service name resolution that torsocks was giving as 127.0.69.0 which I never read about, so I telnetted to it and it's like another entrance point to Tor, or at least my hidden services(?). I'm a little confused. Can anyone clarify?
Followup question- is this IP address static and safe to use somewhere like /etc/hosts?
Not much comes up in a web search but it looks like torsocks tordns_deadpool_range is the key? So torsocks uses arbitrary addresses in that range as "tickets" to translate back into a certain hidden service? torsocks actually binds and listens on those addresses?
So that means I can't use it in /etc/hosts because I have no way to know ahead of time what hidden service will get what address?
