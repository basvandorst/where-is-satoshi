@_subject: Tor v0.2.1.23 dose not work in my windowsXP box and Tor v0.2.1.24 can  
Dear All:
Actually, I am a new learner for the Tor. and experience a issue in my
windowsXP box and Debain box, when I install Tor. both in my windowsXP box
and Debain box, I can never connect to the network. At begining, I just want
to connect Tor. directly, but I always encount the notices like "[notice] No
current certificate known for authority moria1; launching request.", then I
use the Bridge to try it, still stuck at 10%, details log is below:

Is there any one can help me to analysis both of the log to see what is
wrong with my Tor.?
Thank you very much :-)

I have getten my Bridge from bridges at torproject.org yesterday and also
capture this log yesterday, and I also guess it is caused by the unusable
Bridge, so I have sent anoteer mail to bridges at torproject.org, but they no
longer reply me again :-(
Furthermore, I have used wireshark to capture packets between my windowsXP
box and one of the bridge 74.207.232.33:443, you can see below:
158.132.34.176 ==> 74.207.232.33   TCP  eicon-server > https [SYN] Seq=0
Win=65535 Len=0 MSS=1460
74.207.232.33 ==> 158.132.34.176   TCP  https > eicon-server [SYN, ACK]
Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=5840 Len=0 MSS=1460

Ack=137 Win=6432 Len=0
After the last "74.207.232.33 ==> 158.132.34.176   TCP      https >
eicon-server [ACK] ", communication between my windowsXP box and
74.207.232.33 is hang, it looks like my Tor. software can connect with
Bridge 74.207.232.33, but they can not construct the SSL/TLS handshake, do
you have any ideas about this?

Dear Mason:
I try to directly connect to Tor network firstly and it always failed so I
tend to try to use Bridge to connect with it.
I have listed the logs below when I disable bridge in torrc:

Previously, I use the network from HongKong Polytechnical University
(I don't know who is the ISP for HK PolyU), when I try to connect with Tor.
via bridge 74.207.232.33:443, I have found its TCP handshaking works fine,
but SSL handshaking is blocked (A packet for SSL client Hello is sent to
74.207.232.33, but the bridge never gives me reponse):
158.132.34.176 ==> 74.207.232.33   TCP  eicon-server > https [SYN] Seq=0
Win=65535 Len=0 MSS=1460
74.207.232.33 ==> 158.132.34.176   TCP  https > eicon-server [SYN, ACK]
Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=5840 Len=0 MSS=1460
158.132.34.176 ==> 74.207.232.33   TCP  eicon-server > https [ACK] Seq=1
Ack=1 Win=65535 Len=0
158.132.34.176 ==> 74.207.232.33   SSL      Client Hello
74.207.232.33 ==> 158.132.34.176   TCP      https > eicon-server [ACK] Seq=1
Ack=137 Win=6432 Len=0
So I guess maybe the ISP messed up SSL in general?

Furthermore, I run "openssl s_client -connect IP:port" for the bridge may
get a CONNECTED(00000003) and permenant hang, but I do it for
bridges.torproject.org:443, after CONNECTED(00000003), I can get information

I am sorry for my mistake to show up the bridge ip in the unsecure mail
list, and I can take care co it in the future :-)
Fortunately, the Bridge IP I have showed up is directly from https://
bridges.torproject.org, every one can surf the wewbsite to get the ip
directly, that is to say, this leak is just for a public bridge, I hope my
mistake can just make a little hurt to the Tor. network because it is just a
public bridge
Sorry to every one who use Tor. :-)
