@_subject: [tor-talk] a question about ip addresses 
when you start tor for first time it will select a node as first hope, and as while as it works for you, tor will connect to that node. i think it's because tor tries to start as fast as possible.

@_subject: [tor-talk] google meek server returns 403 error to Iranian IPs ! 
i am an Iranian tor user and i need to use Bridges and TransportPlugin to connect to network.
but unfortunately google meek never worked for me. to night i tried to check it out.
so i entered the  in my browser and then this error:
     GOOGLE
     403. That?s an error.
     Your client does not have permission to get URL / from this server. (Client IP address: some.Iranian.IP.address)
     We're sorry, but this service is not available in your country. That?s all we know.
and i think it seams funny that you use google app engine to unblock tor in countries like Iran
and then google blocks Iranian access to that service.
 and  working functional here.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What good is using Facebook through 
Actually it depends on what you mean about "good".
it's good if you want to have a secure connection from your browser to
facebook and have a secure communication with facebook servers. and that
means that no one on the internet (except you and facebook) can not see
your communication with facebook, even tor exit nodes.
and i think it's good for people who live in countries that blocking
facebook. they will have more speed (i think) and better privacy while
using facebook. and keep this in mind that in some countries that
(maybe) facebook doesn't send users info to government (like Iran and
China ) there are so many social activists that using facebook
anonymously. so this service will help them and their readers to stay
anonymous and safe.
But if you want to be anonymous using tor on facebook ,as soon as you
login to your account they can recognize you. and they prevent you to
make an anonymous account. so you need to trust to facebook ,and it's
not "good".
