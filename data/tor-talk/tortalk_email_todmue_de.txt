@_subject: [tor-talk] Using a public relay as a bridge? 
the other day I just for the fun of it tried using a public
relay as a non-obfuscated bridge - it actually works.
Curious: Would be using a public relay I implicitly trust
(operated by a friend, operated by me, operated by the NSA)
as a bridge be a good or a bad idea?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Amazon threatens to suspend Signal's AWS account over 
according to Amazon has explicitly denied usage of one of their domains for
"domain fronting".
As far as I understand it, establishing a TLS connection to
host A, but sending a Host: header for host B (the endpoint
that is supposed to be protected by the domain fronting)
is exactly the mechanism the meek transports use.
Is meek still active? Is this a problem?
