@_subject: [tor-talk] Why do you use Tor? 
For my own part, I use tor when I want to access a .onion site, as a "even more private" browser, but also just to access my own sites/services from outside my network.
Sometimes I use it for no particular reason at all, under the theory that more legitimate traffic helps those who are using tor for legitimate (non-malicious) reasons where their safety and security is a

One of the comments on this bug is severely wrong: "Why the hell doesn't it inform about using plain text .onion connections on https sites?!!! (No questions for https .onion alternate routes.) Example of cf alt-svc: cflarexljc3rw355ysrkrzwapozws6nre6xsy3n4yrj7taye3uiby3ad.onion:443 (plain text (http)!!!)"
This is not correct, alt-svc over port 443 not only uses https, but it uses the certificate of the original site (not the cflarex...onion) address displayed, ensuring that the alt-svc is valid and able to serve traffic for the original site's URL using a valid certificate.
I can't be arsed to register just to post one comment and correcting people who are severely confused about Cloudflare (and/or alt-svc) would easily be more than a single full time job, but it might be worth noting in this case to reduce confusion.

@_subject: [tor-talk] some websites are blocking me now 
I don't think that that is why Craigslist blocks Tor, rather, I think it's more about geo-locating IPs to help negate a wide range of scams which don't require a local presence, and also, to make it easier to detect and track abuse when it does happen.
Craigslist relies heavily on a shadow-ban system, such that when you violate rules and get flagged, your future posts may appear to succeed without ever being published publicly (they show up to you, and possibly other shadow-banned users). This system relies upon being able to identify users and for better or for worse, blocking Tor, proxies, and similar increases the difficulty of signing up multiple accounts in an attempt to keep them unique.
While Craigslist does take steps to avoid being scraped, I believe blocking Tor is more about scam and spam prevention. I could be wrong.
Indeed, switching circuits won't make any difference at all when accessing a service designed to restrict/block Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How do tor users get past the recapacha and it's 
Several Cloudflare staff members have commented that they do support tor and have taken steps to enable tor users to have better experiences than would naturally happen as a result of their automated abuse prevention systems were left to score tor users based entirely on behaviour alone. One such example is that their "Is this a browser or a bot?" JavaScript takes the tor browser bundle's behaviour into account and doesn't penalize the browser for lacking any features which are normally disabled.
However there is a larger than average amount of abuse from tor exits, and this abuse returns intermittently the longer an exit has been around so their automation does learn to treat tor IPs with suspicion. It also means using non-standard browsers (Such as an iOS project) are more likely to fail the "Is this a browser" test resulting in a full CAPTCHA.
To their credit, they do make it easy for site operators to approve tor traffic in a more general way (by treating tor as a separate country in their whitelisting system). I'm not suggesting that Cloudflare couldn't do more/better, but they could also outright blacklist tor trivially or intentionally make the experience much more negative, but based on their statements they have made minor changes to try and improve the user experience without causing their customers grief. And based on their results (the Onion browser on iOS suddenly went from a "always blocked" to "Only occasionally blocked" shortly after I bought up the topic and provided them with a link to it). It is an imperfect world. This is part of why I use TBB for random legitimate things, specifically to increase the amount of "This is just a regular 'ol user, doing regular 'ol normal web things on Tor".

The whole point of tor is that you are anonymous just like everybody else.
Privacy Pass attempts to allow you to bypass CAPTCHAs by providing you with tokens that anonymously prove you have solved CAPTCHAs recently. I have to say, I don’t see this myself on a regular basis. Perhaps you are not keeping cookies such that they can identify the you that passed a CAPTCHA is the same you that is browsing now? Without cookies or other local storage being available, every request is new/unique from Cloudflare’s perspective and therefore they don’t know that you passed a challenge.
It could also be that site owners have set the timeout very low, I can go as low as 5 minutes on the free tier. I believe the default is a week although I’m not certain. I set mine to much longer (but I also whitelist Tor across the board). This is something website operators can control:

Interestingly no, you cannot be tracked across sites. They put a lot of effort into this aspect of the design specifically to ensure that the signing happens only against the blinded version of passes so when the passes are redeemed they can be verified as valid, but not linked to the original generator of the passes.
If you're interested in how this works, they have an overview and links to the actual papers and protocol:  -- You don't need to take my or their word for it, the cryptography is public and you can write your own implementation if you desire or review the source for their extensions should you have the appropriate skill sets (I do not).
There are no default settings at the individual customer or site level to handle tor exit IP addresses differently than any other IP address.
If you can think of a way to differentiate good traffic vs abusive traffic without JavaScript (to verify that the connection is from a human driven browser) and/or cookies (to identify one user from another) and/or a extension such as privacy pass I would encourage you to write a paper and publish it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] CloudFlare captchas disappeared? 
That might be part of it, but I just fired up a fresh Tor browser, opened half a dozen sites that used to always require a CAPTCHA and none did. I haven't used Tor in a couple weeks, so I'm not really sure when this started.
But they did discuss trying to reduce the impact some months ago, and a few weeks ago there was a regression which they were working on addressing. It seems that they actually have improved the situation.

@_subject: [tor-talk] alt-svc supported by TBB 
Can anyone confirm if the current release of TBB supports alt-svc?
I'm testing the Cloudflare alt-svc .onion beta project and I do see the alt-svc header, but I'm trying to determine whether TBB is actually using it or not. It seems like not, given that the website can see a tor exit IP in the Cloudflare headers (I wouldn't expect this since subsequent requests should be delivered over a .onion address).

Primarily to reduce the load on exits, but Cloudflare putting resources into being more usable (and less annoying) for Tor users can only be a good thing for those who use Tor to access the internet.

Using the test page at  I get either red or yellow exclusively, no amount of refreshing and/or changing circuits seems to get green which confirms my own testing on a site I operate that is participating in the beta.

I've been monkeying around a bit, and I can sometimes get this to work, but very infrequently. It feels like if I open a tunnel to each of their .onion addresses first then it increases the odds although I'm not sure if this makes sense since a new hostname (the test site vs their .onion addresses) should result in a new tunnel anyway.
And maybe this is just a limitation of the test site (although I don't think so), but it seems that Cloudflare fails to notice many IPv6 exits, whereas IPv4 exits usually get the country "T1" (meaning Cloudflare knows this is a Tor exit and adds the Alt-Svc header).
Unfortunately the reliability doesn't seem to be here enough to try and achieve Cloudflare's stated goals, but hopefully this is just an early attempt and not the end of the road. On the flip side, maybe it is working a little more than it appears since I'm not seeing CAPTCHAs when using TBB 8, but I am from a second machine running TBB 7.
One final note: Are there any other Cloudflare users on the Free or Pro plans? If so, could you go check if Onion Routing was enabled for you? Their blog says it is enabled by default, but it is disabled on two of my three sites -- Maybe this is due to being part of the beta though, I did manually enable it on that third site and maybe that precluded it from being enabled on my other two?

I don't really think Cloudflare was ever intentionally actively hostile to Tor users, but rather it was an unintended consequence of how they attempted to separate legitimate vs malicious traffic. The reality is that Tor exits emit both legitimate and malicious traffic, and TBB users are (by design) indistinguishable from each other by typical browser fingerprinting techniques, so Cloudflare had no obvious way to separate malicious vs legitimate requests.
For some time Cloudflare has made it easy for site operators to whitelist Tor exits (noting that this means site operators absorb the abuse rather than Cloudflare blocking it, and also noting that only a tiny fraction of site operations actually do this), they also put effort into Privacy Pass (a way to reduce the negative impact without giving up Could they have done more, better, or sooner? Maybe. But alt-svc wasn't supported by TBB until 8.0, and Cloudflare was quick to take advantage of it for the benefit of Tor users, that's worth noting.
More importantly though, even if your belief is that Cloudflare was previously actively hostile toward Tor, isn't a corporation changing their stance a good thing? Isn't a pivot toward being accepting of users who want more privacy than usual a good thing for both regular users and Tor users?

Correct. This is not the only reason to use tor.
There actually are some benefits. And of course, some costs/risks.
If I subscribe to a commercial VPN what are the odds that any other customer of that same VPN are using the same last-mile connectivity/wifi as myself? The situation gets worse if I connect to my corporate VPN service, or run my own VPN endpoint.
Unless there are any other users of the same VPN service, I can be tracked as I move between networks, even if I randomize my MAC address or use burner hardware.
Even if there are other users of that same VPN server, are they configured identically? Does the VPN protocol exchange credentials or certificates securely? Is there any other uniqueness in the initial VPN handshake? Has the VPN service modified their defaults over time, meaning that the date I downloaded my configuration file from the provider dictates my settings providing a further fingerprint? Is my VPN client version unique?
By routing the first hop through tor, I am not consistently connecting to one single endpoint, and I blend into the background with other tor users.
If it were me, I think I would set up a tor hidden service and run a proxy on the .onion to complete the final connection to the internet, either as a proxy or a VPN endpoint.
