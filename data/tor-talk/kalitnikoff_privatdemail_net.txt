@_subject: AdvTor 
Hello everyone. I found a fork (?) of tor software with GUI named Advanced Tor. I was
surprised of its features, but found just nothing about it in web,
though it has opened source placed in sf.net.
Have you people discussed it? Please give a link to discussion if yes.
Otherwise you are welcome (if it won`t break any or-talk rules),
especially I`d like to know if someone can get through the code to
check it for backdoors or something like that.

Hi Mike! Thanks for reply! I suspected the answer will be just like what
you told.
One more off-topic question. Why not QtWeb? It`s not
like "replace Firefox with QtWeb immediately", but "why not to pay
attention to something else, maybe less problematic and secure and
simple". I suppose that you in-development-depth guys already have some
thoughts about it.  Thanks.

This update broke yopmail.com functionality. This is free advanced junk
mail service. As I investigated, the problem is with "Isolate dynamic
content to Tor state" option. Is there something I can do to get it
work again?

Hi. Assuming I have some modern Linux distro and run TBB as separate
user, can I somehow open links from other apps (such as email and im
progs, started as other user) in TBB by clicking on it?

Nope, it will just start another instance of TBB but
with error that Tor is already running.

I thought solution may be something like this
"path-to-TBB/App/Firefox/firefox -profile /path-to-TBB/Data/profile
", but it is not :(

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Bundle: Usability Improvement Proposal 
Hm, interesting thing that very recently I found out such project -
SBrowser282, custom Tor Browser Bundle made by some russian radicals.
It does exactly what you are talking about as I understand. More
interesting that they claim it`s all made with open source software.
Download link:
And as I can see it is just self-extracting 7z archive. Anyway, be
warned about any exe-file!
More links and info can be found here (in russian)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Bundle: Usability Improvement Proposal 
I speak Russian, but I don`t think those people would be interested in
such documents. I made some little more deep research for this
conversation and as I see all that they did was getting TBB,
unpacking it, adding some bookmarks and tweaks to Firefox profile
(just like branding) and packing it back to "click-and-run" executable.
As the point of this thread was about making TBB more convenient to
"dumb people", we and you as developer can ignore all except
technics of packing stuff, because main goal is around that "click
and run" thing, right?
I also know about MicroTor because I like finding all this security
stuff all around Internets :) And honestly I didn`t even use it because
of lack of audit concerns. As you described I did the right thing :)

Do you consider including Convergence (or similar extension -

@_subject: [tor-talk] TB-1.4.2 
Is there a way to not to close Vidalia and Tor itself with browser
exit? Or open TB`s Firefox separately fully functional, with "New
identity" option? When I need to restart FF or when it crashes, it is
very inconvenient to start all cycle again: Vidalia-Tor
connect-Browser. I realize that it is the only reason for me right now
wny I run Firefox separately (though that one which TB contains).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor exit+proxy 
What is the best way to add proxy (socks or whatever) at the end of
a Tor node chain? I mean working way, that YOU use, not that in the Tor
wiki or anywhere outdated in the Internets. So, download TorBrowser
(linux, windows...), then *do something*, voila, a website that blocks
Tor exits is now accepting you, isn`t that great? :) Share your methods,
please. Thanks!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor exit+proxy 
Hi, thanks for detailed reply!
I know about proxychains and windows implementations of it and I
woudn`t ask for help if it was that easy as "proxychains
firefox" :) But I checked again and proxychains with regular
browser works with at least tor local socks5 proxy as 1st hop and http
proxy as 2nd and last (4th actually :) Didn`t try transparent Tor
forwarding, but it would work anyway, I think we all can agree with
VPN through Tor is in my todo list, so i will appreciate any solutions
you will make.
Problems begin when you try to apply this for TB. Since TorBrowser is
hard alloy of Tor and patched Firefox+Torbutton now, it is not a
regular question how to make it work with additional proxy. I
specifically mentioned TB as the way I want it run, because i think
that TBB is the best and most secure way to use Tor to browse the web,
isn`t it?
Maybe I should ask a different question: If I separate Vidalia+Tor and
run proxified TBB`s Firefox with its profile after Tor made its chain,
would that system be less secure? I`m not advanced that much to
understand inner working of patches developers made to Firefox, so
please forgive my slightly ignorant question. I see an instruction that tells use privoxy`s forward settings, didn`t
try that yet, but I tried 3proxy (something the same proxy) with no
success :(
IMHO ideally it would be perfect if Vidalia had option like "Hide Tor
usage and add http or socks proxy at the Tor exit nodes:". Dreams,

I don`t think I could help you with something, as I said I am not so
very tech specialist, but I will do what I can as I researching. BTW, I
found something similar, you may have a look:
Yes, I meant just what described. Since 2007 TB became something more
than bunch of programs that can be configured and run searately
without any worries about security leaks.
But now when I want to do something unusual, I always think of Mike
Perry`s recent statement:  "In fact, if we ever see headlines about a
Tor user compromised, my money is on it being due to that user having
used a custom or obsolete config." (c)
I understand that, but it doesn`t matter when anonimity (hiding your
real IP as most important part of it) is more important than privacy.
Yes, it is what I meant.
Well, I think it is not that developers should worry about :) Not even
in top-10 or top-100. It is more likely that some smart-ass would scare
everyone with such words as "child abuse" and "terrorism" in the
context of average Tor user.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor exit+proxy 
I hope you`re wrong :) Because on the other hand, we have an options
such as ExcludeExitNodes, ExitNodes, StrictNodes,
ExcludeSingleHopRelays etc, which is much more dangerous when set
without extensive brain usage.

Not all proxies are malwared or broken servers. You can buy some totally
legal or you can set up your own.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Open links in TBB 
Which user do you use to run firefox 2nd time?
I suppose you shouldn`t run Tor and Firefox of TBB as different users.
Also if you check you may find that "New identity" option of TorButton
is not available.

@_date: 2012-01-10 23:55:30
@_author: Greg Kalitnikoff 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Open links in TBB 
Because this will break interaction between vidalia+tor and firefox.
Which will cause the unavailability of "New identity" option of
TorButton as I have said before. But still, it`s just my opinion,
I`m guided by my personal consideration: "If developers did things that
way, it should be there, they now better".

Hi all. I just want to inform tor-talks that I had a productive dialog
with these extension`s developer and FireFTP`s DNS leakage is fixed
now. If someone interested - please make some testing.
Here are some details of our conversation:
Hey Greg,
I think I might have a solution for this.  I've uploaded a new version
to my site for you to test:
Sweet!  Great to hear that it worked.
Sure, you can pass the news to the Tor maillist - didn't know there was
a thread about this :P
Yes, correct, the same fix will be made in FireSSH as well.  I will
probably release a new version after I get some other fixes in, perhaps
in a week or two, it depends.
Thanks again for your feedback and help - other users of Tor I'm sure
will be happy :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidalia+Tor separtely from TBB`s Firefox 
Assumption: Modern linux distro. User A is default user. User Net and
group Net are the only ones who is allowed to go to the Internet with
iptables. User Tor is that which run TBB and he is in group Net.
Is it safe to run vidalia+tor as user Tor and "TB/App/Firefox/firefox
--no-remte -profile TBProfile" as default user A? Does it break some
security things? As I  understand so far from "The Design and
Implementation of the Tor Browser", the only thing it could break in
default behavior is "New identity" feature.
The reason for this is that I find very annoying and unproductive to
copy-paste links of my mailapp/im/rss-reader and want to use TBB`s
Firefox as default one.
P.S. Also reading I found this: "Filter-based addons such as AdBlock Plus, Request Policy,
Ghostery, Priv3, and Sharemenot are to be avoided." But here
we see Andrew Lewman`s "In my world, I'd replace noscript with
requestpolicy". I`m a bit confused :-/
