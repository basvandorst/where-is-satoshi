@_subject: [tor-talk] tor phone: Nexus 5X remains black after reboot 
Hi, copperheados user here.
( suggests to join  but that seems to be impossible via tor so I try go get help here via email)
I was running copperhead os on my Nexus 5X so I wanted to give the tor phone prototype a try.
I did run ./run_all.sh bullhead-nmf26q
and everything runs through until the point where it says:
"Please reboot phone into system. If you installed gapps, it will keep crashing until you give Google Play Services the location and storage permissions. ..."
(at the end of flash-signed.sh)
It takes a while to boot (the usual Copperhead OS splash screen) and then the screen remains black.
When I hold the power button I get to see the usual options:
Power off
and at the bottom of the screen the 3 soft buttons [back] [home] [ ]
but the rest remains black.
used version:
(this version did run fine when used without the tor phone scripts)
Is this a known problem? Is there a workaround?
thanks for creating the tor phone prototype, looking forward to use it!
