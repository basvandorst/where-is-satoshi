@_subject: [tor-talk] torifying TB 
Following the instructions in the "Configure Thunderbird to work through Tor" help file. I've successfully set up tormail in Thunderbird. However, I don't know what the "No Proxy for" field on the TB Network & Disk Space > Settings tab is supposed to mean. Whether I leave "Localhost, 127.0.0.1" (as shown in the screen grab in the help file) or delete it altogether, the configured mail seems to work as well. Can some one fill me in on this? Is the field irrelevant to the manual proxy configuration? Apologies for a newbie question, & thanks eli

Yah - When I reload tormail, I get a complaint that Network & Disk Space is misconfigured until I  put "localhost,127,0.0.1" back in the "No Proxy for" field. Of course: "localhost,127,0.0.1" was still in memory until I reloaded. The name of that field could've been clearer, after all the point of manual config. is to set up new http & ssl proxies. Anyway, I  know how to set it up to work, if not quite why.

@_subject: [tor-talk] where did Aurora go? 
Upon the last TBB update, Aurora 9 was replaced by FFox 10, the same
FFox that I use for my clear browsing. Both have the same icon, which
makes it a bother to be sure I'm in the correct browser (while I'm still
running Vidalia from the same HD as I run the regular FFox). Things
would be a little easier to have a different icon for the TBB
implementation of the browser. Can that be done? - eliaz

Ok, thanks. For now if I leave the tor check tab up I can easily keep
track of which browser I'm in.

@_subject: [tor-talk] bridge up & down times 
I have a few novice questions about a normal bridge I've set up. I've
not found answers in the documentation.
* Opposite the one country that's so far listed in the usage summary,
the  column shows "1-8". What does this mean exactly? 1 client?
eight? 1 client eight times?
* When I do have to shut down my machine or stop Tor I'd like to do it
when no clients are using the bridge. The bandwidth graph spikes every
few minutes, hard to predict from it when there might be no traffic. Is
there an app from which over time I could get an idea of when it's least
disruptive to stop Tor? Can't use Arm; I'm running on windows. I can log
onto shell accounts via ssh in PuTTY/pageant, if that's any help. Thanks

@_subject: [tor-talk] bridge up & down times 
You can set the ShutdownWaitLength tor configuration option to something
very high, like half an hour or so. That means Tor will continue
servicing ongoing connections, but not accept new ones. Once there are
no more ongoing connections or 30 minutes are up, Tor will exit.
Cool, thanks. What's the unit for ShutdownWaitLength? (seconds, ms, ...?)

Yup, thanks. I've finally found my way to the Tor manual, so maybe will
not have to ask so many dumb questions.

@_subject: [tor-talk] shutdown latencies 
I'm currently maintaining a (normal) bridge from a machine running
Vista.  I've set ShutdownWaitLength to 30 minutes in  torrc. When for
some reason I have to press "Stop Tor" and get the message "Would you
like to shut down gracefully and give clients time to find a new relay?"
along with the red onion icon, what exactly does this mean? The icon
seems to sit there forever, and I'm loath to evoke Stop Tor again if it
means killing the connection in the middle of someone's conversation. So
I'm asking, When the red onion is up does it mean that people are
actually still using my bridge, or that Vidalia's just waiting for the
shutdown timeout to run its course?
I suppose I can figure this out by some experimentation. But I'd rather
not muck about locally to get a mental picture of what's going on in the
network while someone out there is in the middle of using it.

@_author: eliaz 
@_subject: [tor-talk] shutdown latencies 
Thanks, this gives me someplace to start.
I do other things besides maintain a bridge on this machine; I've set a
half-hr timeout so that I can shut down when necessary & then restart
before the bridge goes down. I thought this would make it easier on the
network & the people using the bridge.
I think I understand you to mean that the clients (nodes) are talking
code to each other, and the actual users don't even notice that the
bridge is gone & they're on a new path. Is this correct?
I exaggerated; I guess I've been too busy (aka too damned impatient) to
wait more than 30 minutes... Thanks again - eliaz

[TBB -7.1 on Vista x64] When I overwrite log notice in torrc to warn, I

@_subject: [tor-talk] keyserver not responding 
Sometimes when I try to import a key as per the TBB download instructions the process works fine; but at other times the transaction goes as follows:
C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Gnu\GnuPg\gpg2.exe --keyserver x-hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0x63FEE659
gpg: requesting key 63FEE659 from hkp server pool.sks-keyservers.net
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
I'm doing this from an elevated Vista 64 prompt. I've tried unloading the associated certificate from Kleopatra, and also cold-booted my machine, to no avail. After backing up to a previous restore point (done for other reasons), the import works fine, but only the first time. I've not found the string 63FEE659 in the OS registry. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong, and how I can clean up what's blocking the import? Thanks, eli

This is interesting, maybe. I found that I can get to sks-keyservers.net
over Tor or from my SSH shell account, but not over untorified firefox.
Once there I searched for the sig. in question & C&P'd this into an asc
file & imported to Kleopatra. Then I could verify the fingerprint &
authenticate the browser bundle. I'm still mystified why I can't rouse
the keyserver from a command prompt, but will let that problem go for
now. - eli

@_subject: [tor-talk] node depictions in network map 
I've recently started seeing pairs of in-country nodes in the network
map. I recall reading that that for security reasons only one node in
each country would be indicated, except when a circuit
(node1 country A) -> (country B) -> (node 2 country A)
was being depicted.
Do the depictions of wholly in-country circuits
(node1 country A) -> (node 2 country A)
indicate a problem?
I believe I've started seeing these after starting to run a (normal)
bridge. - eliaz

@_subject: [tor-talk] number of relays by country? 
Partly as a way of learning more about my normal bridge works I'm
thinking of asking a friend of mine in a far country to set up a tor
client. There are no relays in his country as far as I can tell from the
Network Map & listing, since I can't arrange the listing completely
alphabetically by clicking on the flag column & I'm going blind
scrolling thru it.
Is there somewhere a list of the number of relays by country?
Also, I suppose I should warn my friend not to set up his client as an
exit node if it's to be the only one in his country. But would he be
less than normally anonymous (that is, subject to discovery at other
than entry & exit nodes) just by connecting via my bridge? I hope these
questions make sense. - eliaz

@_subject: [tor-talk] Best practice yet again 
So my bridge relay has been running fine in the weeks since I set it up,
the usage summary is showing up to eight or nine different countries, no
trouble is showing up in the logs. Memory usage seems a little high
running on Vista_ x64 but I can live with it. I still have a little
concern that some bad actors are walking across the bridge, but I guess
there's nothing to do about that. The problem is that I'm doing
everything on one machine and have to stop Tor for 20 minutes or an hour
every four days or so to do some housekeeping, and I'm not sure if the
disruption that may be causing warrants my putting in a dedicated
machine. I've written ShutdownWaitLength 40 into torrc; since I mostly
run the bridge but don't log onto the network much myself, I've also set
KeepalivePeriod 7200 (2 hours). Are there are other torrc options that
will help mitigate the effect of the shutdowns? I also reboot my gateway
(the router/modem firewall) once every day or two and I don't know how
disruptive the resulting change in bridge address is. Any advice as to
best practice would be appreciated. - eliaz

@_subject: [tor-talk] high memory usage 
The only problem I have with the bridge I'm running is that for some
reason the memory used keeps climbing up, so that after three or four
days I have to reboot the machine. AFAICT rebooting doesn't affect the
bridge's usefulness much, but I can't do much else when the mem use
reaches 2.9 G. I recall seeing some discussion of this way back in
tor-talk, but can't find it. Can someone point me to it? [Running on
Vistax64 2.5 GHz dual core cpu, 4 G RAM] Thanks - eliaz

Thanks Jude. I don't think anonymity has been compromised, while running
the bridge I haven't used the client, being busy with other things. I
haven't had time yet for *nix. I've run VirtualBox for a couple of
years. (For the devil of it I've run Vidalia successfully in Win2K in
the VM, and also off a flash drive, but don't have any reason to think
those two ways would be any more secure than running off the Vista host
Thanks too for Jon's & Robert Ransom's replies. I was running no extra
apps when this problem started. I'm using TBB 2.2.35-7.1, it's clean.
Looking at processes, I see way too many new svchosts. I'm running
tasklists in a batch file for the next few days to see what the svchosts
are carrying & what changes as the memory use rises. So far no malware
reported by AVG, I'll run a full system scan tonight. After that I'll
recheck my local & modem/router ports. The bridge has been carrying
traffic from up to 14 countries according to the bandwidth usage,
sometimes it's quite heavy. AFAICT the message log doesn't show anything
amiss. - eliaz | gpg ID: C3E1E38D

@_subject: [tor-talk] Where to advertise bridges? 
I'm also interested in the question. It might better be phrased "How do
we inform people of our bridges who can use them?"
If the following is off the wall I'll be glad to be corrected.
I hang out in emigre & exile communities; sometimes I'll invite myself
to a meeting of a group I know nothing about except that comms to the
home country has been blocked. Most of the people I meet have other
things on their minds besides installing & managing Vidalia, or the
knowledge & equipment to do so. I don't feel confident myself to engage
in training. But I wear a tee with the Tor onion in the expectation that
if someone recognizes it, he or she will remark on it, and then I can
offer the existence of the bridge. I do the same thing when I meet with
peace-activist or humanitarian-aid groups. so far I haven't had any
takers, but this seems like a simple way of spreading the word to those
who can use it.- eliaz
