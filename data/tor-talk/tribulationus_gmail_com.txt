whatever i want Annonymously. I have Tor Browsr but all the
intructions lead me to download after download. I realize its
important but its so confusing. Codes, tails, onions lol, blockers,
HTTL, IP addresses, bandwidth, open this before u open this, keep
refreshing this and that. Whew! Its a headache. Im mid level computer
lit. Lol.

Thank you so much Derric. You explained very well. I have Tor Browser
and The Onion program.  Anything i need to do to the settings on
either of those?? Do i need anything else? Final question, what do you
recommend for downloading movies,music etc?? I download alot lol. I
like sites with lots of options. Fast, secure, etc..
