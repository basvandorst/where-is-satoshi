I wrote to you a week ago. see below for original message.
I would like to participate in this survey but for some reason uMatrix
blocks qualtrics.com, can you host it elsewhere?

What is the point of doing all this? Do you really wish to do this? You
are going to give them your phone number and I really don't see
any point of trying to hide your ip from them.
Anyways, imo you should just use orbot (probably dead) or something like
that and route all your traffic using orbot vpn (it sets up a tunnel if
you want to route other apps) or whatever you want and set that vpn to
`always on`. Idk what else you can do, also your first method of routing
your traffic through your computer is not that good.
If you are real serious about this thing then just setup a virtual
machine and route all traffic from that vm through Tor. This is the
best method that comes to my mind.

Yes I agree with this but in my country (yes country) you cannot get
away with that, everyone over here who has a smartphone probably uses
whatsapp and you cannot tell everyone to switch to

No! Don't use it if you are actually very serious about this.
because what if something fails somewhere and your ip gets leaked? are
you really sure that everything you've setup will work without fail?
Also see nathan at freitas.net 's email, > Since WhatsApp is executable
code on your Android phone, it can access information about your device
directly. This includes accessing your "real" IP address through local
network information APIs.
The idea is you'll setup a virtual machine and route all traffic from
that vm through Tor. First search result is ->
Note: I don't know how they did it and didn't read that article.

My advice is to stay away from Tor. DO NOT connect to Tor network
directly because if they are blocking whatsapp then probably there are
idiots in power and they would do the same thing for using Tor. If they've blocked whatsapp and you can face jail time for using it,
then don't use it. If you want to talk encrypted with your
friends/families then there are lots of other services that support end
to end encryption. signal, wire, keybase, email with gpg, xmpp, matrix,
(tutanota, protonmail - both, not good but okay in this case).
On android download f-droid ( and look for delta
chat, that probably makes email with gpg easier. For gpg download
openkeychain. you can also use k9-mail if you don't care about the ui.
for gpg resources see:
and links below.
Yes, feels bad. Internet was meant to be open for everyone.
Jailtime for using something like whatsapp is insanity, they will fill
up the jails real quick if they try to arrest everyone. Do they only
arrest those who speak against them, or everyone? You have to decide
for yourself what you are going to do about this.
These websites have good information and you should read it all.
The real question should've been, `how do I hide my whatsapp usage from
my government/isp?`. You should always explain what you are trying to
achieve and not how you would achieve the method you thought. Maybe
someone will have some other idea that is better than yours.
Anyways, I looked up that article and read it and I wouldn't recommend
doing that because you can still get it wrong and thats going to be
very bad in your case. Also see, Connect to Tor through a bridge and not directly. See

So use whatsapp without directly? :/
are you going to speak what they do not want? If no then they
themselves don't care about you talking normal stuff on whatsapp with
your friends/family.
whatsapp has end to end encryption in place and they *cannot* know what
you are talking with anyone on whatsapp! Don't discuss that stuff on whatsapp, simple!
You just said, "The goal is to talk with  friends/familie and all other
professionals". If your goal is to just talk with friends/family and
your isp is not blocking whatsapp then use it directly! whats the issue
with using it directly??
You can be that `someone`.

DON'T use the number from that site to create your whatsapp account!
Some other person can do the same and you'll lose your account.
Also, maybe your friends/family will fall for a phising attack after

That was a typo, I said use whatsapp directly.
From all this discussion I am deducing 2 points:
- you need a secure way to talk to your family/friends and
- you also have to write stuff against your government which may put
  you in danger. so you want to do this anonymously
You don't have to mix these 2 things. You are a normal person who talks
to friends over whatsapp and you don't give a shit about whatever the
government is doing. That will be your first identity, a normal person.
You can publish your ideas through  or
Use those with Tor. To reach more people you can write a comment on a
big news site from your country, or maybe if they have a subreddit then
post on reddit. You could also print some posters and stick it on
Don't use whatsapp as a medium to share your ideas, instead publish
them there and send the links to others.
