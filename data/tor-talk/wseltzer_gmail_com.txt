You called?  :)
As far as the law goes, ISPs should not face liability for users' bad
acts if they do not specifically assist or benefit from them.  They
offer general-purpose transit (like, but not quite the same as common
carriage, which is defined by law both to prohibit discrimination and
to remove liability).  Tor node operators should be in a similar
position -- we're offering general purpose technology, for plenty of
uses recognized as lawful, and can't block particular uses without
breaking the generality and limiting the functionality of the node.
This is mostly common law (contributory and vicarious liability, or
aiding and abetting), not statute.
Unfortunately, what the ISP can lawfully do, and what it chooses to
allow customers to do are often far apart.  They're often motivated by
how much nuisance someone else causes them, rather than the law.  If
you can share with me (wendy at seltzer.org) some of the complaints, I
will think about additional responses to use in the persuasion.

Documenting your experience is helpful, thanks!  I hope you can also
get to the root of the problem.
I can't give you legal advice, but I've operated Chilling Effects for
7+ years without encountering any serious problems publishing
cease-and-desist letters people have received.  I haven't heard that
the postings have caused anyone else trouble either.  We've said that
posting the letters is necessary to analysis of their legal claims,
and therefore fair use, see
