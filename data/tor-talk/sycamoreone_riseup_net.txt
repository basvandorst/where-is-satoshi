If you find more of these libraries then please let me know. So far I
haven't seen anything.
(I acutally realized only a few days ago, that some of the newer
bridges are actually written in Go. I guess there will be some
interesting code in there at least, but I haven't looked yet.)
Oh my! I only stared orc because I wanted to learn about the control
protocol, and now I have to life up to standard of Stem et al. But I
will do my very best.

I also changed the translation of "Connected to the Tor network!" from
"Zum Tor-Netzwerk wird verbunden!" to "Zum Tor-Netzwerk wurde verbunden!".

And once you a sure you can connect to the hidden service and won't lose
the onion address, you might want to add
ListenAddress 127.0.0.1
to your /etc/ssh/sshd_config to disable regular connections.

blobby at openmailbox.org:
I can't say anything interesting about torsocks as a program, and am a
happy user. But there are some interesting gotchas, mostly caused by the
convenient but unnecessary *magic* in modern interactive shells.
One example: Type
  $ torsocks git push local_brach:remote_br
into a bash prompt on a stock Debian system (with real branch names and
the name of the remote branch not complete). Then press tab for
auto-completion. The branch name will actually be auto-completed, but
the connection to the repository needed to get the list of branche names
won't use torsocks and Tor.
Die ich rief, die Geister, / Werd' ich nun nicht los.
There are ways to solve such problems though, like `man iptables` and a
lot of free time. Or just using Tails.
I have no idea if similar problems also apply to ssh.

Just some clarification:
"unnecessary" is probably the wrong word. I meant "not strictly
necessary" and not "useless".
This should be
    $ torsocks git push repository local_brach:remote_br
And looking into /etc/bash_completion.d/ (or the zsh equivalent) might
be enough to see if there is any magic for the program you want to use.

I recently started to implement parts of the Tor control protocol in Go.
The result for now is a thin abstraction layer that still might be
useful if somebody wants to use the control protocol from within a Go
The code is at I do have some ideas for a higher-level interface, but no fixed plan
yet. The next step will probably be to add net/http like handlerFuncs to
handle (asynchronous) replies from the onion router.
