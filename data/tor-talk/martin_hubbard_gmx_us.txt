However, any serious use (such as Amazon, Google checkout and VoIP accounts) requires confirmation by telephone. They call you, and you either enter a code from the webpage on the phone, or vice versa. That requires getting an anonymous cellphone, which must be activated by telephone. Pay phones are hard to find these days in the USA. Small towns seem to be the best bet. It's also good to have a voicemail-to-email account, given that you probably won't be answering that cellphone very much. You never use it from your home area, of course.
 You also need a snailmail address, and it must be valid. I've had good luck with recently-failed businesses, such as restaurants. It's not hard to find comments on food review websites. Also, some payment processors decline transactions made through VPNs, so you may need to visit a relatively distant city, and use a free WiFi hotspot. I typically use the same metro area for VPN exit IP, snailmail address, cellphone number and free WiFi hotspot. Be sure to spoof your WiFi MAC address (macchanger on Linux) before connecting. You can use your anonymous cellphone while you're there. I typically use anonymous TCP VPN through Tor through semianonymous UDP VPN.
 By the way, this identity is one that didn't work out very well, with many failed experiments that may have attracted attention. A little more won't hurt.

 Adblock Plus and Ghostery should be included in Tor bundle Two reasons 1. Privacy. Fairly obvious why we do this. Stopping ads and ad tracking is consistent with the privacy mission of the Tor Project. 2. Network health. Congestion has always been a problem on Tor. Installing these plugins to stop HTTP requests which don't help the user reduces congestion on the network and speeds up page loads for each user and everybody else. Browsers won't be slowed down loading tons of ads and ad scripts and the network won't have to process many requests for junk. I think we can save a ton of bandwidth by stopping the junk requests. While we are at it we should enable Firefox's do not track header. It won't help the network speed but it will marginally increase privacy for those who have it set. It will also protect the privacy of people who enable it manually if all Tor bundle installations are sending the same headers. It also increases the use of the header in the wild because the mo
 re browsers that send it the more advertisers and governments have to take notice of our desire for privacy. The Tor project can make a big contribution to making this header more widely used. The Adblock should be configured to work and not need setup. Select a few good lists and have them automatically in. This will save users the time of doing it themselves and help people who don't know how. Ghostery has to be configured to block tracking scripts and cookies before first use. The Tor project should have that done automatically. If anybody doesn't want to use Adblock they can disable it with one click. I don't know why anybody who goes to the trouble of using Tor would want to be tracked by ads but to each his own. Disabling it takes 2 seconds if somebody want's to. _______________________________________________ tor-talk mailing list tor-talk at lists.torproject.org

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question about hidden services 
If there are multiple servers hosting a hidden service using the same private key and URL, the one that has announced most recently gets the requests. During transitions, there's apparently some network segmentation. At times, different clients can be simultaneously hitting different hosts. But it seems to settle down after a while. There are some interesting possibilities here, I think.

 Hey all, I was unable to find this question in the documentation, so I'll ask it here. I hope it's the right place. What happens when two servers running TOR provide a hidden service using the same private key? Which one will get the requests for that service? Will it be distributed randomly, or will there be some kind of conflict? Thanks, John _______________________________________________ tor-talk mailing list tor-talk at lists.torproject.org

Dunno when ra last time updated the software package but the blog entry was last edited May 29, 2011 while latest Tor release is from December 16th, 2011. Which means ra's package probable does not contain the latest version of Tor. Many people (ra, JanusVM, me) are interested in deploying something ra calls 'Tor Workstation', which might not be the most bad name. (an isolated machine which routes everything transparently through Tor) As long as this project isn't an official Tor package it seams somewhat difficult to keep it as current as the latest Tor release. People get busy with their lives, forget about the project or loose interest. Problematic thing about this is that Tor users will still find old discussions on Google and
  still download and use potentially dangerous old Tor versions. > It's an OpenWRT VM with virtual LAN > routed through Tor. > > It seems to borrow from the Torouter project > .

If I understand Ra's reasoning, he argues that using Tor gateway VMs is more secure because workstation VMs only have Internet connectivity through Tor. Blocking leakage around Tor doesn't depend on proper routing and proxy configuration in the VM. Any non-TCP traffic from the workstation VM just gets dropped. Users may break TAILS trying to watch YouTube. With the Tor gateway+workstation setup, users can screw up the workstation VM, but they'll be safe as long as they don't NAT the LAN interface to host, or break Tor in the gateway VM (which would require some Linux skills). Of course, TAILS is most secure when run as a LiveCD, which isn't possible with the Tor gateway+workstation VM setup. Perhaps someone could create a LiveCD with Linux, VirtualBox and the VMs.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hi all! 
> 2. What is the best way to use a VPN with Tor to increase anonymity?
 You're not going to get better anonymity by using VPNs with Tor. Anonymity is what Tor does very well, far better than any commercial VPN arrangement. With VPNs, there are potentially always logs that lead back to you. You can make the trails hard to follow, by nesting VPNs from multiple providers and paying anonymously, but you can't eliminate them.
 You can use VPNs with Tor in two ways. You can route Tor through VPN services. That prevents your ISP etc from seeing that you're using Tor. Generally, VPNs are more popular than Tor, so you won't stand out as much. Once the VPN client has connected, the VPN tunnel will be the machine's default Internet connection, and the Tor Browser Bundle will route through it.
 You can also route VPN services through Tor. That hides and secures your Internet activity from Tor exit nodes. Although you are exposed to VPN exit nodes, you at least get to choose them. If you're using VPNs in this way, you'll want to pay for them anonymously (cash in the mail, Liberty Reserve, well-laundered Bitcoin, etc). However, you can't readily do this without using virtual machines. And you'll need to use TCP mode for the VPNs (to route through Tor). In our experience, establishing VPN connections through Tor is chancy, and requires much tweaking.

 That is a very good point. On the other hand, such profiling can be advantageous in fleshing out an identity.

 Generally, virtual private networks (VPNs) are just that. You can think of VPN connections (aka tunnels) as virtual ethernet cables. Organizations typically use VPNs for LAN connectivity among locations, and with remote staff. There are three main protocols: 1) PPTP (outdated, simple, insecure); 2) IPsec (current, complicated, secure); and 3) OpenVPN (current, arguably less complicated, secure).
 In this context, however, we are using "VPN" in a more restricted way, to mean VPN "anonymnity" services. That is, we mean VPN connections to remote Internet gateways, rather than to remote LANs.
 Regarding Tor, you must trust the design, the validity of the security assumptions that it's based on, and the software implementation. To the extent that you don't understand any of that, you must trust the developers. If you trust Tor itself, you don't need to trust the other participants (or vice versa). But you have no way, as a user, to really know how anonymous you are.
 Regarding VPN services, you must trust the operators, as well as their designs, assumptions and implementations. Some VPN services are basically just VPN-connected proxy servers. They know who you are, and they know where you've been. Other VPN providers may claim to increase anonymity in various ways. They may claim to route connections through multiple, geographically widespread servers and routers ("multi-hop VPNs"). They may claim to mix traffic on links and exit nodes that are shared with associated organizations ("multiplexing and crowding"). They may claim to require joint authentication, by mutually anonymous administrators, for access to, and configuration of, shared resources.
 However, everything can be logged, by every device that's involved (servers, routers, switches, etc). VPN providers may claim that they don't keep logs, that their designs make it difficult or impossible to keep logs, and so on. You can nest multiple VPN services, using providers who seem unlikely to collude and cooperate with your government. You can pay anonymously. But again, you have no way, as a user, to really know how anonymous you are.
 As a user, for both Tor and VPNs, it comes down to trust. Tor is arguably more likely to be more anonymous. Accessing Tor through VPNs can't hurt. Routing VPNs through Tor may be appropriate under some circumstances. But doing that will create shared history for each VPN that you use in that way. You obviously don't want to use the same VPN service on both sides of Tor.
 If you're interested in learning more, there are many informative threads on Wilders Security Forums.

Same here :)
To the extent that I understand, coderman seems to be proposing the
layer-3 approach from Kiraly et al. (2008) with multi-homed endpoints
and various traffic control mechanisms. That does seem interesting.
Perhaps someone could comment about Tor's current development plans
(or point me to documents)? Maybe I should just look ;)
This is the issue that's been nagging me. The utility of Tor (or
coderman's vision, or even VPNs) is limited when access can be
detected and blocked. Could something like Tor operate through
covert channels (1,2)? Although only ~0.1% of total bandwidth would be
usable, that might be enough with widespread streaming HD video.

That's also true, I believe, if one runs a torrent client (or whatever) on a VM that connects only through a TCP-based VPN service (anonymous, paid with mailed cash) which connects through Tor. ?The VPN will handle all traffic from the VM, whether it's TCP, UDP or whatever. ?That's not the case if one routes Tor through a VPN, by the way. ?However, one can use VPNs on both ends of Tor, without much additional penalty. ?But I can't imagine why anyone would want to torrent through such a kludge. ?Using multiple nested VPNs is argumentally anonymous enough for most purposes, is much faster, and doesn't waste Tor's bandwidth.
