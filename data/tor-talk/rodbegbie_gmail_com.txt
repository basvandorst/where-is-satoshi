Funnily enough, my Mac at home dies when I run Tor for a few hours. It sits there fine 99% of the time, but when I start-up Tor again, I
get a kernel panic.  I've had almost *precisely* the same experience
as Eddie (right down to shutting down Tor for a week, then starting
it up again and seeing a crash).
I agree that it's probably hardware related rather than Tor (and have
been unsuccessfully trying to track down an Apple Hardware Test CD
since I've lost mine), but it's quite the coincidence!

Interesting document.  Thanks.
In the meantime, I'm leaving my exitports fairly limited -- DNS, POP,
IMAP, SSH and Rsync -- I'm looking out more for the folks (like
myself, when at work) stuck behind FascistFirewalls.

Me too, for that exact same reason.

Understood.  But if those of us who are *currently* running a server,
and have taken the time not only to read the F manual, but also take
part on the mailing list, are unwilling to use the new "default"
settings, then it would seem unfair to make them the defaults for
someone just running Tor for the first time.
I allowed exiting on Port 80 until I read this list and saw that
folks were getting abuse reports due to Google Groups.  That's when I
stopped it.  I don't believe we should be putting new users in a
position where, by default, they are open to getting abuse complaints
to their ISP.  In that circumstance, they are more likely to
uninstall tor than to read the manual and/or lists and tweak their

If *I* do it?  My node (arsecandle) acts as a middleman node, an
entry node on 443 and 80 for folks behind FascistFirewalls (like I am
at work), and exits on SSH, IMAP, POP and DNS.
So that's still pretty useful and valuable to the network, I feel. Correct me if I'm wrong, and I'll shut down tor forthwith, and return
the bandwidth to my constantly running BitTorrent client.
If every single Tor node blocks port 80?  Then the usefulness drops
to near zero.  Agreed.  But there's a big difference between "off by
default" and "never on".
In the same way that port 25 is off by default, I think 80 should be
too.  IMHO, YMMV, HAND, etc.

Agreed.  In-line comments in torrc are the least-possible
documentation someone can read before becoming a tor exit node.
As a compromise, how about blocking 6667 and 80 in the default tor
ExitPolicy, then having in the supplied torrc:
# Port 80 (HTTP)   Administrators running routers with port 80 open
# have received abuse reports regarding Google Groups, and been
# added to the IP blacklist at Wikipedia
 accept *:80
Easy to enable if you want to, and the server operator is aware of
the risk.

That doesn't convey the *risk* involved in to the person running the
Ignoring the theoretical complaints to your ISP that can come from
opening any port for exit...
Currently, there are (to my knowledge) four services that, due to
proxy abuse, use IPs to blacklist access:
* SMTP (blocked by default policy)
* Usenet (blocked by default policy)
* Web content systems (bulletin boards, wikis, blog comments, etc)
* IRC
Not warning a user in (metaphorical) BIG FLASHING LETTERS that
running as a tor Exit node in its default setting can cause them to
get blocked from the last two is, IMO, a colossal mistake that will
cause disgruntlement towards the Tor project.
If people understand the risk, they can feel free to take it to
further the goals of the project.  But asking people to take this
risk without warning is, in my opinion, a foolish and selfish thing
to do.
DMCA Safe Harbor rules may reduce the risk of getting kicked off your
ISP, but the fact that my Mac at home is in the Wikipedia block list
is not something I'm too happy about.
