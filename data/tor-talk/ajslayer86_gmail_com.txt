@_subject: [tor-talk] location question 
tor claims to mask your location. i tested out this feature by visiting a
youtube video that is blocked in my country. after using tor to visit the
page, and repeatedly using the "new identity" feature to no avail. if anyone
has any advice on this, i would appreciate it. youtube video address below.
