@_subject: [tor-talk] How to select the path using the weights? 
I know how these weights (Wgg, Wgm .....) are calculated. But then what?
How to choose the path using the weights? My understanding is to calculate the weighted sum of the bandwidth of each possible circuits (Isn't the computation too much?). And then choose the path with the maximum bandwidth (Then every one would choose the same path)? Or using the bandwidth to build some probability distribution?
I am totally confused.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to choose guard node? 
"Tor maintains an ordered list of entry nodes as our chosen guards"
----Does this mean all clients are using the same list?
"Tor chooses at random from among the first NumEntryGuards (default 3) usable guards on the list."
-----If all clients are using the same list, only the top three can be used?
In addition, is the order of the list determined by the time order they were put in the list?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Where can I find the used circuit information? 
I've got a private TOR network running in the lab. As a user, where can I
find the information about all the circuits used, such as the nodes selected
for each circuit?
