@_subject: TOR ON FREEBSD 6.1 "Could not bind to,127.0.0.1:9050: Can't assign 
Hello and sorry for my (primitive) English.
I am a new user of FreeBSD. Frequently I am using Tor and Privoxy on
Windows and they work easily. So I wanted to try them out on FreeBSD,
but at each time I receive these messages:
...# tor
Sep 14 17:43:51.488 [notice] Tor v0.1.2.1-alpha. This is experimental
Do not rely on it for strong anonymity.
Sep 14 17:43:51.492 [notice] Initialized libevent version 1.2 using
method kqueue. Good.
Sep 14 17:43:51.532 [notice] connection_create_listener(): Opening Socks
listener on 127.0.0.1:9050
Sep 14 17:43:51.532 [warn] connection_create_listener(): Could not bind
to 127.0.0.1:9050: Can't assign requested address
Sep 14 17:43:51.532 [warn] Failed to parse/validate config: Failed to
bind one of the listener ports.
Sep 14 17:43:51.532 [err] tor_init(): Reading config failed--see
warnings above.
...# privoxy
Sep 14 17:44:25 Privoxy(134729728) Info: loading configuration file
Sep 14 17:44:25 Privoxy(134729728) Fatal error: can't bind to
because Can't assign requested address
This is the message in the Privoxy log file:
"Sep 14 17:44:25 Privoxy(134729728) Info: Privoxy version 3.0.3
Sep 14 17:44:25 Privoxy(134729728) Info: Program name: privoxy
Sep 14 17:44:25 Privoxy(134729728) Info: Listening on port 8118 for
local connections only
Sep 14 17:44:25 Privoxy(134729728) Fatal error: can't bind to
because Can't assign requested address"
I have tried tor-devel-0.1.2.1, tor-0.1.1.23 and tor-0.1.0.14, but
the results were the same.I have changed the default port number (9050)
in the configuration files, but nothing to do: the response was the
same. To install tor-tsocks-privoxy I have created the files torcc and
tsocks.conf and I have installed them in their own default directories.
Also, I have changed the privoxy configuration file according to the
instruction of the documentation. My firewall is IPFilter and the rules
are the most permissive. All my Internet programs work relatively well:
browsers, mailer, p2p and Apache too. Only tor and privoxy fail completely.
If anyone know the problem and the solution --if there's a one-- thanks
in advance.

I have solved the problem making a new networking configuration by the
installer of FreeBSD. Now it works (fine) for the web whereas not for
the mail.
Thank you for your help.
