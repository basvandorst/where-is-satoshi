@_subject: [tor-talk] A curious email from Twitter mentioning Tor Project 
I have been as well, and I've also received that notice from twitter.
I don't think I'm a particularly suspicious or special person to any
government, should we pass this off as a false alarm triggered by using
tor to twitter, or is there a really poor system out there trying to get
at people's accounts for the crime of association with people/projects
of interest?
An odd coincidence too: my e-mail host had its drives confiscated by
authorities[1] about a week after twitter noticed me, but that is almost
certainly nothing to do with me.[2]

Under "The hole in TOR":
But, Tor cells are a fixed-size of 512 bytes:
Regarding timing attacks: doesn't the "natural" deviation in latency
over the internet, and the size of the tor network, make correlation a
bit more difficult (for short-lived connections at least)?

Paul A. Crable:
No. The entire point is that no one is censored. To allow some form of
censorship would only put pressure to allow even more censorship with
time, and trust and anonyminity would be broken.
As can be seen by several of the busts you may have heard of,
authorities can still catch "the bad guys" because they will eventually
mess up, and get be revealed.
Around 18:30 of Cypherpunks Part 2[1] Appelbaum even makes the argument
that removing things like child abuse material don't help the problem,
and may even worsen it.
I assume from the context of illegal activity that by pornography you're
talking about child abuse material (ie "child pornography")
There was a study that said a majority of /Hidden Services lookups/
seemed to point to child-abuse-related .onions, there are some
confusions on how this information can be taken though.
Dr. Gareth Owen explains this a bit in his 31C3 talk[2] If you don't
have the time to watch it, it basically boils down to (iirc):
 a) HS traffic can't be directly calculated, you can only guess based
    on estimated of how many times its address was looked up
 b) anti-crime/anti-abuse are known to scrape onions in order to conduct
    investigations and gather hints, which may account for part of those
    high lookup counts.
 c) This is only Hidden Service traffic, which when compared to the the
    rest of Tor traffic, is about 1.5%[3]
So no, 80 Percent of Tor Traffic Is Not Child Porn.[4]

tor-admin at torland.me:
Given that there's a gap from 29-31, this may be an error with metrics.
There have been other miscounts in the past couple months[1][2]

Suggestions so far are "a2dismod status" as you said, or as a more
general solution, binding the onion service to an address other than

Nearly every thread in the past week on this ml has been on this topic.
Some of these posts are honestly the most stupid things I've read on
this list, posts whose only worth is to mock for the sheer awfulness of
