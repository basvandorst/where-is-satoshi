@_subject: [tor-talk] Craigslist now blocking all Tor IPs? Template for anyone: 
Craigslist was slowing down anyone with a tor IP, though it appears
they may be blocking the majority now.
The automated messages from Craiglist appear like this:
This IP has been automatically blocked. If you have questions, please
email: blocks-b1406984946068001 at craigslist.org
A template for anyone who feelsl ike emailing craigslist (or their
favorite site):
Please kindly remove Tor IP addresses from the list of blocked IPs
by your site! The IP address your site has blocked is from the Tor network, which is
a censorship resistance, privacy, and anonymity system used by whistle
blowers, journalists, Chinese dissidents skirting the Great Firewall,
abuse victims, stalker targets, the US military, and law enforcement,
just to name a few. For more information, please see: Unfortunately, some people misuse the network. However, compared to the
rate of legitimate use (the IP range in question processes nearly a
gigabit of traffic per second), abuse complaints are rare.
 As can be seen from
the overview page, the Tor network is designed to make tracing of users
impossible. The Tor network is run by some 5000 volunteers who use the
free software provided by the Tor Project to run Tor routers. It is also possible to download a list of all Tor exit IPs that will
connect to your servers at the following link:

@_subject: [tor-talk] jondonym over tor, tor over jondo? 
It appears that with JonDo (similar to tor), it is possible to use tor
as the initial proxy used to connect to the jondo network. Is it
appropriate to call this "jondo over tor"?
This can also be done in Whonix: Is it be possible to do the opposite, "tor over jondo", where jondo is
used as the initial proxy into tor? Particularly, by entering the jondo
ip/port settings into this vidalia panel:

Excellent. Thanks!
I'm not sure if you are familiar with a more friendly sandbox use
of docker (subuser), e.g. with an easy firefox setup preconfigured: Perhaps this work might help as a comparison, or to avoid re-inventing
the wheel.

@_subject: [tor-talk] howsmyssl 
While on the topic, these links discuss this issue and provide a test
for the TLS suite:
The link states that: Another issue is the support for the
SSL_RSA_FIPS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher, which may or may not be a
good idea to use: Firefox 26 supports cipher suites that are known to be insecure.
This setting can also be disabled in the Firefox configuration. In the
about:config screen, search for security.ssl3.rsa_fips_des_ede3_sha and
disable it.
Should this also occur in TBB?

@_subject: [tor-talk] firewall prompt gone in 4.0? 
It appears the nice firewall prompt has been removed in TBB 4.0. For
those of us who block all but a couple outgoing ports (and all the
incoming), is the only way to retain this functionality to edit the
"torrc" file with something like below for every new download?
ReachableAddresses accept *:80
ReachableAddresses accept *:443
Compared to the menu item, this seems rather inconvenient for linux
users who (quite surprisingly) don't have any well-developed means
to block outgoing traffic on a per-application basis, and resort to the
less effective, though slightly more cautious practice of just opening a
couple outgoing ports?

@_subject: [tor-talk] force apt-get & yum updates through tor? 
I'm wondering what the best way to force yum and apt-get through tor
is, in fedora 21 and debian 7.7 respectivly. Are any of the following
least likely to produce dns or other leaks, or considered safest?
In fedora, I see several options for forcing yum through tor:
OPTION 1: (appears to work)
sudo nano /etc/yum.conf
ADD THIS: proxy=socks5://127.0.0.1:9050
Use yum normally...is this likely to leak anything, dns perhaps?
OPTION 2: (safest?)
sudo torsocks yum ...
This seems to work, though produces lots of this error at the command
line: WARNING torsocks[12367]: [syscall] Unsupported syscall number 191.
Denying the call (in tsocks_syscall() at syscall.c:165). Is this a
concern or just noise?
OPTION 3: setup privoxy with tor, direct yum through privoxy
OPTION 4: specify tor-ip:port as socks_proxy enviornment variable
OPTION 5: proxy3 recommended here, though I don't see why this isn't just less
For debian 7.7, the only one that seems to actually force apt-get
through tor is torsocks
OPTION 1: sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf
ADD THIS: Acquire::socks::proxy "socks5://127.0.0.1:9150";
When using apt-get as normal, debian ignores this and skips tor
OPTION 2: sudo socks_proxy=socks5://127.0.0.1:9150 apt-get update
Debian ignores this too.
OPTION 3: (the only one that works)
sudo torsocks agt-get ...
Appears to work and produces no errors as it does in fedora 21
OPTION 4: (untested)
Alternatively, does anyone know a clean way to force all traffic
through tor?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fedora repo Tor broken? 
Tor recently removed their Fedora repos, which leaves the fedora native
repo. However, it's not working for me, and never has. Any help would be
appreciated, since I depend heavily on the system tor, and the Tor project
repos are gone!
What I'm doing:
sudo dnf install tor (from fedora)
sudo service tor start (or systemctl start tor.service)
Job for tor.service failed because the control process exited with error
code. See "systemctl status tor.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.

Thanks! The 2nd fixed the problem for me. It occurs on multiple versions of fedora and systems, so it seems like a
small bug in the Tor install they should probably fix.

@_subject: [tor-talk] PDF download difficulty in TBB 
Lately, I have been having trouble downloading PDF files with the tor
browser bundle. Viewing PDFs in-browser works fine. But, if I "save as"
or if I try to save the file from the built-in viewer in the browser,
the download just ques indefinitely. Is anyone else having this issue? This problem does not seem to occur for other file types, such as
images for example. It is also not a problem in stock firefox routed
through tor.
