@_subject: uninstalling Tor on the XP side of a MacBook 
I use a MacBook with Parallels Desktop for the Mac to run XP and Mac
OS at the same time. In general it all works well.
I installed Tor on both the Mac and XP sides.
When I first tried to shut down the XP side after the Tor
installation, it hung. I tried to uninstall Tor, Vidalia, etc., using
the uninstall program. It still hangs. I now have to power off the XP
and Mac sides to shut down my laptop. The error message says to 'End
Now' the "Tor Network Map," but I can't hit the end now button under
the turnoff dialogue box. And "control alt delete" on a MacBook
keyboard doesn't work to shut down the XP program. When I boot up
solely on the XP side, the vidalia uninstall program is the only Tor
program that appears, and it doesn't uninstall.
I'm left with powering off both operating systems regularly. Ah, XP...
Any suggestions for getting rid of the Tor Network Map on the XP
permanently, for the time being, please?

@_subject: [tor-talk] browser with best privacy without using Tornetwork 
Dear Roger et al.,
My Mozilla Firefox browser (most recent version) slows down after
about 15 minutes, so that it becomes inoperable. Could this be
happening as a way to prevent someone using TOR/Vidalia?

Is there a way to check or prove that Tor / Vidalia / Firefox etc., is
actually working?

How does Tor/Vidalia handle the issue of one's computer recording one's own
key strokes unbeknownst to the end user, in IE, in comparison with the
somewhat new Tor Browser, or the issue of software that can take over one's
computer, such as the Dell computer help desk software was able to do to
help customers, with consent, back in the later 90s?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Will Tor affect Internet Explorer? (newbie question) 
While someone using IE reading this thread might want to switch to Tor
Browser Bundle, and do so, I have a related, newby question: once having
switched to Tor Browser Bundle, and, if one also wants to make browsing on
one's smartphone secure with Tor, how does one do this?
I've downloaded, for example, Orbot and Orweb, which I think are Tor
Browser Bundle parallels for handheld internet phones. I've also configured
them successfully, I think. But I haven't been able to get a specific email
site up in my Orweb browser ever (over 2-3 months), whereas I can get some
other web pages, like google.ca, to work, sometimes. I use Android 4.x.
It seems logical for non-Tor entities (e.g. like states' parties) not to
allow individual's complete security - which is partly why Tor was written,
I hypothesize - but why can't I access this email site, and what can I do
to access it, please?
Here's to moving away from IE and toward more security on all of the
computers one uses.
And thanks for writing the Tor Browser Bundle.

If I've moved away from IE to Tor Browser Bundle on my Mac desktop with a
relatively new Mac Operating System 10.6, - and don't plan to use Orbot and
Orweb on my handheld, because while I can log into my non-mainstream,
specific email website, I get a white screen after that, and also don't
plan to use Tails in the near term - and I've changed my passwords, how do
I know the specific email website (possibly located in a foreign country-

Hi All,
In thinking about scaling Tor, what plans do you have for all 7,106 +
languages in the world?
MIT OCW-centric, CC World University and School is planning to be in all of
these languages -  - as well
as in all 242 countries -
 - with accrediting law
schools in each, if possible, under one umbrella.
WUaS seeks to become the MIT / Harvard of the internet in all languages and

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and solidarity against online harassment 
Dear Roger and all,
As an example of an (arguably) extreme form of "harassment" which I could
call the 9/11 tragedy, can someone please explain how Tor mitigates, or
protects against, the kinds of online communications that would/could have
lead to 9/11? What's the reasoning and rationale that Tor can prevent
another hypothetical 9/11, anywhere in the world, if there's no "back door"
for state surveillance by the US or other nation states' governments (i.e.
to protect against terrorism/harassment, for example)? In other words, how
does Tor work, in theory, to protect against terrorism (as harassment or
against the World Trade Tower tragedy and related?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is there any societal use in Bitcoin? 
World University and School (which is like Wikipedia in 295 languages with
CC MIT OCW in 7 languages and CC Yale OYC) is taking an all ~200 countries'
official languages' approach to developing blockchain / bitcoin ... but
planning too for health care data, for example, in the blockchain -
plus an online bookstore / academic press in each of all 7,099 living
languages re bitcoin ... and for developing an universal basic income for
all 7.5 billion people (with nation states as the basic unit re their law
systems and tax systems) - and presumably some of these people will receive
this UBI (ethicality-wise) in a bitcoin-like digital currency.

Thanks ... let's see how bitcoin in combination with the blockchain ledger
for health care and possible resource distribution develops ... and
potentially country by country, nation state by nation state, language by
language and legal system by legal system ...
