@_subject: [tor-talk] Dos defense .0.4.2.5 
How do I configure my hidden service to use the latest Dos defense in tor
In my tor/torrc file underneath my hiddenservice info I added
HiddenServiceEnableIntroDoSDefense 1
HiddenServiceEnableIntroDoSRatePerSec 25
HiddenServiceEnableIntroDoSBurstPerSec 200
and tried to reload tor which failed, I then tried remvoving the numbers
from the end and still failed.
What am I doing wrong? Do I need to place it in a seperate location?
