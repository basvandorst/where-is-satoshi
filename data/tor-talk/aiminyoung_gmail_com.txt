I have setup a private tor network containing one client, one dirserver,
and three relay nodes.
To make the changes of relay nodes take effect to client, I have to shorten
the updating period of directory information on dirserver and client.
V3AuthVotingInterval, V3AuthVoteDelay, and V3AuthDistDelay on dirserver
were set to 60 seconds (source code about the minimum limitation were also
modified),  so that the cached-consensus is updated every 1 minute.
Now I have problem in accelerating the cache updating on client because I
can't find the command to make it.
Is there other ways to shorten the updating interval on client, such as an
delay constant in source code?

Hi Karsten
Thanks for help.
I did have set TestingTorNetwork which also changed default values of
V3auth* flags as described in tor manual.
However they seems to be only about consensus on directory server.
I will give a try to using Chutney and update results here.
Best regards,

Hi Karsten
I've found some new settings from Chutney torrc template,
TestingServerDownloadSchedule and TestingClientDownloadSchedule.
Then I upgrade my tor to 0.2.5.2 since the new settings are available in
0.2.5.x and gave small values to the settings, but no help.
So I went back to source code and found that in directory.c the directory
request parameter "if_modified_since" came from "valid_after" plus a
constant 180. Though I'm not sure about the reason this number written in
numeric instead of a constant definition, I removed it and now the
consensus file in client can be updated in a period of
Thanks again for the guide.

Hi Karsten,
On the directory server side, I've modified the definition of
"MIN_VOTE_INTERVAL" in src/or/dirvote.h to 10 (down from 300) to make Tor
accept a smaller V3 voting interval.
(NOTE: The Tor version is 0.2.5.2-alpha)

Hi Karsten,
A small voting interval is to update consensus file in directory server as
soon as something changed in relay nodes. Otherwise the time for the newest
relay status passing to a client would be at least 5 minutes plus client
pooling interval.
Indeed, 10 seconds is too over. I set the value just for inspecting the
change easily.
Best regards,
