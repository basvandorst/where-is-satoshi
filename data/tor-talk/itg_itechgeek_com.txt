If you enforce TLS, you won't be able to send/receive email for many
Also REQUIRING PGP will prevent tor users from communicating w/ many people.
So if Snowden had been using an email service using your onion <-> Internet
email gateway, he wouldn't have been able to initiate contact w/ Greenwald.
Some people don't need encrypted email or even secure email, they just need

Use a local public free hotspot.  McDonalds, Starbucks, local library, etc.

You can also do hosting via Amazon S3 (example:
Or you can set-up Amazon Cloudfront (CDN) which will pull from S3 or
someplace else (This is severely broke, but you get the idea:
In either case, if you use the Amazon assigned hosts, they would just see
ssl traffic to/from Amazon.
Another option (cheaper) might be to set-up a Google Apps Engine site to
serve the files.
Traffic to/from Amazon/Google might be less likely to be blocked (unless
the Iranians catch the traffic w/ a hacked CA cert).

@_subject: [tor-talk] US ip address 
Would it be possible to tell tor to use a specific exit node (or exit
country) for a specific subset of websites (I don't know if this is Ted's
specific use case), but for example if I was in Europe or Asia and wanted
to watch my normal Hulu shows and wanted tor to act normally for everything

That was just the first example that came to mind and that most people are
familiar w/ of something that is targeted geographically, but there are
other things that are targeted geographically.

@_subject: [tor-talk] HR4681 Sec 309 communication privacy legislation 
This is all mute:
(i) the communication has been affirmatively determined, in whole or in
part, to constitute foreign intelligence or counterintelligence or is
necessary to understand or assess foreign intelligence or
Item I probably is intended to cover FISA warrants.  Which is what the NSA
has been using to get info from companies already.
So I read this as they can keep the communications indef if it is encrypted
or they have a FISA warrant, FISA warrants are already NSA general
procedure for getting everyone's emails and call records.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hulu now blocks Tor 
When I received the error, I called Hulu (I'm a Hulu Plus customer) and
they submitted my IP for whitelisting and and told me I would be back up in
3-6 hrs.  I was back watching Hulu within an hour.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Comcast looking for Tor traffic, 
I would just like to chime in as a Comcast customer, tonight was the first
time I've tried hopping on tor browser since this rumor surfaced and
traditionally when I launch the tor browser I see tor connect and I'm on.
Tonight it took a couple minutes before I was able to connect (I was able
to search for this thread, catch up on every message since the 14th, and
read Comcast's notice and the comments before tor was connected-Not sure if
tor has ever taken that long to connect).
This could just be something going on tonight or Comcast could be doing
traffic shaping and this would be another Comcast will deny all
interference with traffic until someone proves otherwise.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Comcast looking for Tor traffic, 
Ok, it did start-up much quicker when I just did it.
So I guess Comcast isn't shaping anymore than things like Netflix.
I just don't remember it taking so long even w/ a fresh download of TBB.
I'll try to remember to try it out on a couple evenings this coming week
and see how it works.
Once I was on, it felt a little slow but I think it has also been a while
since I've used tor during the 6pm-10pm weekday timeframe.

Fox/CNN, I would say they're equally worthless.
Only reason Faux News probably cares about tor is they've been trolled too

And if they were willing to give that out, imagine how much China, Iran, or

@_subject: [tor-talk] Senior US District Judge Leon Jordan rules against 
"Jordan allows the government to use the evidence gathered by the FBI in
the case against Scarbrough over the objections of defense attorney Gregory
P. Isaacs. Jordan used the “federal good-faith exception” to rescue the
evidence. Under that exception, if federal agents believed they were acting
under legal authority and did nothing illegal in their efforts to secure a
warrant, the evidence can still be used.
“(Isaacs’) objections that officers acted deliberately, recklessly or with
gross negligence and that it should have been apparent to law enforcement
that the Virginia magistrate lacked authority to sign the warrant are
simply unsupported by the record,” Jordan wrote."

The way I read that, it didn't seem like a victory since the judge is still
allowing people to be prosecuted (granted some of them deserve it), but the
judge said the FBI needed a warrant in the local jurisdiction of the raids
and they didn't.

They haven't released any reports of how they found the server as far as I
It could have even been the same way they got Freedom Host (the owner
converted Bitcoin to cash using a Bitcoin ATM and got his photo from the
ATM) or Silk Road which I think they intercepted in the mail some fake
passports** he bought.
**As to why they intercepted those fake passports could have been a case of
parallel construction or a known illegal service.
