That wouldn't affect the torrent too badly; clients will keep
downloading without complaints even if they can only get to the
tracker once in a while.  As long as you make good connections to the
tracker occasionally, you're fine.
Of course, even that isn't really needed, since most BT clients these
days will run just fine for public torrents without ever speaking to
the tracker, and instead just doing P2P communications only.
