@_subject: [tor-talk] Where is the tor signing key? 
torbrowser at torproject.org is the correct email address, but you may be
querying the wrong server. On the page you referenced there is a section
for this:
Fetching the Tor Developers key
The Tor Browser team signs Tor Browser releases. Import the Tor Browser
Developers signing key (0xEF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290):

The key is available on keys.openpgp.org, as well, if you need it from
another key server:

Browser installation within the last 6 years. I'm not sure why you are
only seeing it in the most recent version. As for why we add this
"Caches" directory, I don't know and I don't know if Tor Browser
actually temporarily caches information there.
For those who are curious, the initial patch was:
from Yes, all updates are cryptographically signed. The format is described
on Mozilla's wiki: Coincidentally, I documented the Tor Browser keys earlier this week:
That sounds like

@_subject: [tor-talk] Idea for a stand-alone browser based on Tor browser 
While this may be useful for some people, The Tor Project has no plans
for providing such a browser. All of the above reasons for using Tor
Browser without Tor are real usability issues we need to address and
resolve. This includes trade-offs between privacy and performance.
The simple fact is that if you want to use a browser that provides the
privacy and security protections of Tor Browser, then you need to use
Tor Browser. You can't use Tor Browser without Tor and get sufficient
privacy protections. Network-level security is the most important
attribute of Tor Browser. Without tor, you are trackable by your IP
address, cache isolation won't save you.
Tor Browser without Tor is just...Browser (basically Firefox in private
browsing mode). If that is really want you want, then I suggest you look
at ghacks-user.js [0] for modifying a Firefox installation. The
maintainers are excellent. Jeremy's pointer to SecBrowser seems like an
option, too (but make sure you understand what you're getting before you
trust it).

@_subject: [tor-talk] .onion alt-svc issues? 
Hello everyone,
I'm curious if anyone has recently experienced issues with websites
offering .onion alternative services. We have a slightly old Tor Browser
ticket for "prioritizing" .onion alt-svc entries over non-.onions, but
in my testing I could not reproduce the described behavior. I am going
to close the ticket as worksforme if this isn't a bug anymore, as it was
probably solved between Firefox 60esr and 68esr.
If you can reliably reproduce it, please provide detailed steps (either
here or on the ticket) and I'll investigate it.

I assume this means you are running Tor Browser in non-private browser
mode? Otherwise clearing the cache before restarting shouldn't have any
This is our current assumption, but we don't have any more information
than what you described and our personal experiences.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB-10 cursors, pointers location 
Do you have Firefox installed and does it use a different cursor theme?
Tor Browser does not (intentionally) bundle a special/specific cursor
theme, Tor Browser should use whichever theme that Firefox uses, unless
there's a good reason we should use a different one.
