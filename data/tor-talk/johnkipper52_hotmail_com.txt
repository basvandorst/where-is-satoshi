Is there a configuration option available in Tor that will disable internet browsing and only allow connections to .onion hidden services?
Or a simple modification in the source code to achieve the same thing?

No I mean I want my 'client' to only connect to hidden services, i.e. my browser only loads up hidden service websites but NOT any internet websites (not using the exit nodes).
Sorry for confusion.
