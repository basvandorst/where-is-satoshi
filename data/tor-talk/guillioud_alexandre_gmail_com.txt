The bigger the key is, the longer (cpu cycle) it take to encrypt/decrypt ?

My guess is that the Key size is configured right into the node's source
If you apply multiple key size accross the network, you're exposed with the
smallest encryption key of the circuit.
Except for one thing : if somebody can break one of the circuit's key,
depending of the node number into the circuit, he can be able to read your
message. But without a timing attack or an attack on all the circuit's keys
(destination/from adresses datas are encapsulated one into another), he
can't know the entry, exit node or target adresses at the same time.
I'm a begginer here, don't take my words for truth ;)

One ask triggering another :
How do you do a timing attack ? What are the necessary steps to be
successfull in such a thing ? Where can i find some documented timing
attack scenario ?

So, if you're parano?d, or doing something where parano?d behavior is
requested, use a vpn inside and outside tor.
Use linked proxy's on top of this. You'll be fine.

I'm in a hurry so, i describe a little scenario :
+ Launch a vpn/ssh tunnel service, and secure bind privoxy/proxifier into
it. (this one is for scrambling, linearising data)
+ Launch a system like Privoxy and/or Proxifier
++ Bind several linked proxy (your data will pass thru each of them)
+ Launch Tor sock service to connect threw it (force connect threw it with
Secure Binding in Privoxy or Proxifier, did'nt remember)
+ A other vpn/ssh tunnel with cipher/crypt techno than the first one ?
With that, you'll have some second of latency. But you'll be hidded, even
if tor is break. Timing attack become quasi impossible, beacause of
scrambling/linearisation of the vpn/ssh tunnel.
Enjoy ? :D

One thing i forgot.. The last vpn/ssh tunnel need to be totally secure.
Basically, you need your personnal anon server to do that. If you can't
handle your own service, you'll better stay with tor as the last system in
the pile.

Why not using some exotic scramble of keys/method to encrypt the whole
message ?
The only way to hide/protect us from something we don't know, is putting a
mess in protocols. A big mess.
The point is : How can we unscramble it at the end without revealing the
secret necessary to scramble it ?
Guys, if you are in trouble with NSA, or other US governmentals agency,
you're screwed. Physically. Don't mind your electronical com'.

Hi all,
I'm reading your conversation, and i'm not understanding very well what you
mean by high/low latency network. Isn't it just a ping duration delta ?
You speak about low and high latency like it's a feature.
Is tor mixing only low latency with low latency in its circuits ? Opening
for a dispatching of services (ie. mail on high latency, web on low ) ?
What's the point ?

Wooo thank's Tom ! First time using mailing lists, i'm going to like it :D
(and it's not a problem to answer from work :DD).
Ok, so i understand what you're meaning by high/low latency network.
Just, why don't apply this to web browsing ? Can't each node keep packet up
to 5 seconde based on random ? 5 second isn't a problem, as tor network is
already long to serve pages/packets.
paths for clients.
It will confuse basics users,
And power users will tweak this to allow only low latency circuits.

My thought are as following. Why keep entropie where you can have chaos ?
I agree that tor is already CHAOS from an exterior point of view, but a
little more is never bad :D
What i was saying is no configuration for the end user. Just dispatch on
the first node on the most efficient circuits for the current datatype.

outlaw => i d'ont mean what you describe. If i run an exit node and sniff
every http packet out, i'll don't know where request are from, but i can
see every parameters/data of post/get requests. Not every website has ssl
activated guys.
Hidden services are another use case. There is no exit node, just an entry
node to the hidden service.
I don't know what happens when the two circuits connects. How are they
connected ? It's the weak point !

"HTTP Referer will give away the URL

Here, what you call cleint, is the web browser ?
Could tor sanitize everything which is send in "$_SERVER" var before
sending web request ?
Or is it the work of privoxy/other proxy and tor will never do this ?

What's all that bullshit around tor about its security.. The source is
fully disclosed, maintenaned by open source agents. Their are well known
flaws into the system, but, from my engineer point of view, not enough to
void the usage of it.
Come on, some big company/agency can spy by overloading exit nodes ? Just
rely on inside networking (hidden services) to protect yourself ! Add to
that a OTR communication mean, and i doubt anyone could eaves drop or even
read your message... As long as asymetric encryption is safe (and by safe,
i mean the whole stack. Plug your random number generators on REAL white
noise generators, and use function well known with a very good dispertion.
