@_subject: [tor-talk] OONI, 
We are very pleased to announce that the registrations for the OONI Open Data hackathon ?A Dive Into Network Anomalies? are now open!
If you would like to come to Rome, Italy October 1st-2nd 2015 and hack on some internet censorship data in the Italian Parliament NOW is the moment to register.
By visiting  at the end of the page you will see a list of projects that we have proposed ourselves. We strongly encourage people to submit their own ideas and don?t want to put any limits on what you can do.
We are also very happy to announce that AirVPN has offered to sponsor the prizes, so there will be some interesting prizes for the awarded teams.
Unfortunately due to particular house rules it is a requirement that people submit their full legal name and we need to submit these names to the Italian Parliament before the event. Moreover the style police will be making sure that people are wearing jackets at all time while inside of the Italian Parliament (again, sorry this is not our rule, but be creative, what is the REAL definition of a jacket? ;)).
If you need travel and accommodation support do not hesitate to contact me as we do have some (small) budget for that and would be very happy if it were used by somebody that would not be able to attend otherwise.
Nothing is left, but to invite you to register and see you soon in Italy!

Have fun!
The OONI team & Arturo

@_subject: [tor-talk] New OONI release: Test sites you care about! 
Hi Seth,
When you click on a link with OONI Run the user is presented with a page that shows them the list of URLs (if the test is web_connectivity) that they are about to test.
If a malicious URL is included in such list, the user will be able to avoid running it by simply clicking the X button.
The run.ooni.io links are also defined as a custom URI inside of both apps, so if the app is installed, the user will actually never be connecting to ooni.io servers.
That said, something to keep in mind, is that OONI Probe is not a privacy tool, but rather a tool for investigations and as such poses some risks (as we explain inside of our informed consent procedure).
We are not aware of any OONI Probe users having gotten into trouble for using our tool, but we prefer to air always on the safe side be sure that they understand very well the speculative risks that they could run into.
Hope this answers your question,
Feel free to contact me on and/or off-list if you have any follow up questions,
~ Arturo
Hi Maria,
I also posted this question as a comment on the blog post, but I was
wondering if OONI encounters adversarial activity from censors who
try to either locate and shut down OONI nodes, or return different
information to OONI nodes than to other Internet users. If so, the
OONI Run feature could make it extremely easy for censors to identify
where OONI probe nodes are located, by just setting up a site under
their control and submitting it to OONI Run. But maybe this isn't a
problem that the project has encountered so far.
