Advertised bandwidth is the minimum of bandwidth rate, burst, and
observed bandwidth.  You write the first two values into your torrc, but
the third value is measured by your relay.
You can find the advertised bandwidth value on the Atlas page of your relay:

No.  Relays only report total bandwidth, not bandwidth spent on exit
traffic vs. entry or middle node traffic.
If you assume that most of the traffic in the Tor network is for exiting
to the Internet and not for directory requests or hidden services, and
if you assume that circuits are on average 3 hops long, roughly 1/3 of
all traffic is exit traffic.  Not a super precise estimate, but should
be sufficient for this case.

Hi Sebastian,
Atlas does not yet support looking for bridges.  See You're right, it's lying about being able to discover bridges.

Onionoo supports everything that's necessary for Atlas to show bridge
information.  It's just not in a human-friendly format.
Well, the back-end can handle bridge nicknames.  It's just that Atlas
can't make use of returned bridge information yet.

Good point.  We scrub TCP ports before publishing bridge descriptors,

 I just opened  for this.  Thanks.
I'd say a stable address is important for a bridge.  Bridge clients
cannot compensate bridge address changes manually, so the bridge user
would have to go find a new bridge.  Of course, if you don't have a
stable address around, running a bridge on a changing address is better
than running no bridge at all.

Dear talkers,
I'm thinking about shutting down a service that is currently running as
part of the metrics website:
  If you have never heard of this service, great!  Please stop reading and
carry on.
If you have used this service in the past, please let me know if
switching to one of the alternative services would be a major pain for
you.  Alternatives are:
    The main feature that these two alternatives are missing is that they
don't tell you about relays that have been offline for *more* than a week.
Also note that there's ExoneraTor which tells you whether a given IP
address was a Tor relay, which goes through the entire descriptor
archives since October 2007:
  The major argument against keeping the relay-search service is that it's
one of the few remaining things that require us to keep a full database
of relays on our already overloaded metrics machine.
My current thinking is that the relay-search service is only used,
because it's linked from various websites including Tor Weather and the
Relay Configuration Instructions on Debian/Ubuntu.  Those links could be
changed to Atlas or Globe easily.
If there are no good reasons for keeping the relay-search service, I'm
going to shut it down by the end of the year.
All the best,

Hi Roger,
so, the information you learned from relay-search was that the relay
"was up for that one consensus period and then down after that."
You could have learned this specific piece of information from Onionoo,
too, by looking at the "first_seen" and "last_seen" fields, e.g.,
I'm pasting relevant parts of the output here, because these relays
aren't running anymore and will disappear from Onionoo's output after
being offline for a week (which already happened for the relay showing
up briefly on December 1):
{"relays_published":"2013-12-09 08:00:00",
"last_seen":"2013-12-03 04:00:00",
"first_seen":"2013-12-03 04:00:00",
"last_changed_address_or_port":"2013-12-03 04:00:00",
"last_seen":"2013-12-02 16:00:00",
"first_seen":"2013-12-02 16:00:00",
"last_changed_address_or_port":"2013-12-02 16:00:00",
"bridges_published":"2013-12-09 07:37:04",
However, I admit that the above would have worked in this specific use
case only.  Or maybe there are similar use cases where Atlas or Globe or
Onionoo have the information you're looking for.  But in general,
Onionoo provides less information than the original consensus entries
and relay descriptors that relay-search returns.
Now, how can we make sure that you (and others) have the tools you need
to debug the network?  I can see three possible ways, starting from the
one I like most:
1) We teach you how to use stem to debug the network using downloaded
descriptors from metrics.  I think Damian would be happy to help you
with this.  And we shut down relay-search by the end of the year.
2) Whenever Onionoo or Atlas/Globe are missing information that you need
to debug the network, you tell us about it, and we try to extend the
Onionoo protocol and the Atlas/Globe user interfaces.  We'll have to be
careful what to add to Onionoo in order not to run into new performance
problems, though.  And we shut down relay-search by the end of the year.
3) We keep relay-search by making it a service of its own, separate from
the metrics website.  That won't solve the problem that the database is
growing and growing, but it will allow me to continue refactoring the
aggregation code for the metrics website and eventually add new
statistics that you care about.  The main downside is that we'll have
yet one more service to maintain.
What do you think?
Let's try to find a solution that doesn't lead to sadness.
Okay, will do.

Technically, that should be possible.  The Tor process probably won't
even notice that it's acting as client and server.  I'm planning to do
the same thing for measuring hidden service performance in Torperf.  I
didn't try this yet, but I don't expect any issues.
Of course, from an anonymity POV, there's a quite high probability that
you're using the same entry guard for the actual connection between
client and service.  That entry guard could easily detect from traffic
patterns that you're connecting to yourself.  Not sure if that matters
for your use case.

Hi Norman,
yes, it's worthwhile to answer this question!  I can imagine how at
least Shadow and the Tor path generator would benefit from better client
models.  User number estimates on the metrics website might benefit from
them, too.
I found two tickets where we asked similar questions before, and maybe
there are more tickets like these:
Some very early thoughts:
- How do we make sure that we ask a representative set of people to
instrument their clients and export data on their usage behavior?  If we
only ask people who read their favorite news site twice per day, our
client model will be just that, but not representative for all Tor
users.  (Still, we would know more than we know now.)
- Can we somehow aggregate usage information enough to make it safe for
people to send actual usage reports to us?  I could imagine having a
torrc flag that is disabled by default and that, when enabled, writes
sanitized usage information to disk.  For this we need a very good idea
what we're planning to do with the data, and we'll need to specify the
aggregation approach in a tech report and get it reviewed by the community.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Number of tor users 
Hi Maimun,
this is a fine question.
Actually, what you find on metrics.torproject.org *is* the estimated
average number of Tor users per day, not the total number.
Here's how we calculate those numbers (simplified): we sum up daily
requests by Tor clients to the Tor directories to fetch the network
status document, assume that an average user makes 10 such requests per
day (some make just 1 or 2, others 15 or 20), divide the number of
requests by 10, and have our estimated average daily user number.
But we don't have data to say whether two requests were made by the same
client or two different clients, mostly because clients can send their
requests to hundreds of directories which cannot exchange data on
requesting clients for obvious privacy reasons.  That's why we cannot
calculate total users per day, just averages.
For more details, see these reports:
I wonder, why did you think metrics.torproject.org shows total users per
day, and how can we make it clearer that these are in fact daily averages?

Hi bridge operators,
Nick rightly suggests moving this discussion from Trac here: What do
bridge operators expect when providing a ContactInfo line?
Details are on Trac, pasting below:
There's an interesting question in the Tor StackExchange beta:
I'm guessing that a bridge uploads its ContactInfo to the bridge
authority, so there's a point of contact for the Tor project.
Is this information available to any other parties, i.e. users
requesting bridges, or people randomly connecting to IP addresses
looking for Tor installations?
In practice, users of a bridge will be able to learn the bridge's
ContactInfo line, because they download the bridge's descriptor.
But Tor people will have a hard time to do that, because this line is
removed from bridge descriptors in the sanitizing process. One needs
access to the non-sanitized descriptors, which limits the set of people
to maybe five. I don't remember a single time in the past couple of
years when we tried to contact bridge operators using provided contact
This is rather unexpected for bridge operators, I'd think. I guess most
bridge operators would expect their contact information to be known to
Tor project people and used for debugging only.
Three options:
1.    We conclude we don't need the contact line for bridges, because we
wouldn't contact the bridge operator anyway. Bridges should remove that
line from their descriptor before uploading.
2.    We decide this information is important and that we should have it
available more easily. We don't remove the ContactInfo line when we
sanitize bridge descriptors.
3.    We don't change anything, because everything's fine as it is. At
least now we know this information is theoretically available to a few
Tor people and definitely available to bridge users.

These mirrors are run on a server that is kindly hosted by TheCthulhu

Note that, while these mirrors are run on separate hardware, they're
still not fully independent: they are operated by the same person (me),
and they have been initialized using a data snapshot taken on the
official server a few weeks ago.  I hope that we'll have another set of
mirrors ready in a few weeks run by iwakeh that is truly independent.

George Kadianakis reports [20] preliminary results from "a project to
study and quantify hidden services traffic." George emphasizes that they
"are collecting data from just a few volunteer relays" and that
"extrapolating from such a small sample is difficult." Taken with a
grain of salt, they "estimate that about 30,000 hidden services announce
themselves to the Tor network every day, using about 5 terabytes of data
daily." They "also found that hidden service traffic is about 3.4% of
total Tor traffic." George, together with Karsten Loesing, wrote a short
technical report [21] with more details on their results and methods.

Hash: SHA1
For a start, look up the terms "advertised bandwidth", "bandwidth
history", and "consensus weight" on Metrics:
Basically, all three numbers are determined via quite different
approaches.  Also note that consensus weight is not measured in bytes
per seconds, but doesn't have any unit.  That's why you can't really
compare these numbers.

@_author: Karsten Loesing 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Why is there a huge gap between Total BW retrieved 
Hash: SHA1
Advertised bandwidth is the minimum of bandwidth rate, bandwidth
burst, and observed bandwidth.  So, it may be the case that it's the
same as observed bandwidth, but better also consider the other two
bandwidth values.
Relays report a bandwidth history in their extra-info descriptors.
You'll have to sum up all values for a given day to obtain the daily
total and compute the daily average.  But beware of duplicates.  I'm
afraid this is not exactly trivial to compute using Stem.
I found they wrote that "w line is An estimate of the bandwidth of this
sounds like dir-spec indeed claims that consensus weight is
currently in kilobytes per second, but I'd strongly suggest not to
rely on that.  Better consider it a unit-less value and don't compare
it to the other bandwidth metrics.
I'm afraid I don't know enough about Stem to give advice good here.
Let me ask, though, what exactly you're trying to achieve?  Maybe
there's an easier way to achieve that than writing your own Stem script.

Hash: SHA1
Hi Luke and Nusenu,
what you could also do for updating is include a `If-Modified-Since`
header and check even more frequently than twice per hour.  See the
example below.
Regarding a history view, I recommend against creating an archive of
Onionoo data.  The main reason is that there's no easy way to go back
in time and generate past data.  Another reason is that you'd create
yet another place that keeps state and that requires somebody to pay
attention to.  If you're really interested in creating a history of
relay locations, let's create a new data-aggregating module for
Metrics.  That module would produce a .csv file containing aggregated
statistics on relay locations over time that OnionView could use as
well as other graphs on Metrics.  For example, that file could contain
a snapshot of relay locations once per week since 2007.  However,
that's a medium-sized project, so if you're happy with an OnionView
without history, just enjoy that. :)

Leiah and I were wondering if people here have feedback on these logos
or wordmarks.  Maybe there's an easy way to make them prettier or
easier to understand for new users?  Feedback welcome!
All the best,

Q: How often are graphs updated?
A: The graphs and tables on this website are updated multiple times
per day. However, some graphs have the last few days cut off, because
we don't have enough data available yet. It simply takes time to
report, collect, and process all the data.

Yep, it's an error, not an actual change in user numbers.  I'm working
on fixing it, but that might take until tomorrow.  Thanks for reporting!

How important is the French version for you?  I'm asking, because we
should still have a couple German and English brochures left, but we
didn't print the French version yet.  And when do you need them?
I'm also copying Juris who might have an even better answer for you.

Who was so careless to make such a claim?...
Without promising anything here, if we order a bunch of French
brochures to your address in Luxemburg, would you redistribute the
extra ones you don't need to people who ask for French brochures in
the future?  If so, how many would you need and when do you need them?
 Or maybe let's talk about the details off list.

Hard to say.  There have been more timeouts and failures on that day,
too, which would lead to fewer actual measurements going into the
graph you posted:
But note how the first quartile and median stay unchanged and just the
third quartile goes up.  Nothing to worry about, just more outliers
than usual, I'd say.
Feel free to take a closer look at the data, and maybe you'll find
something I'm overlooking:

I can't find a relay with nickname sputnik1 in the current consensus
nor in the consensus archive from last month.  What's its relay

There's a relay with that fingerprint, it's just not called "sputnik1":
Is that the node you're looking for?
Thanks for running a relay!

That file only gets written but never read by tor, AFAIK.  You'll have
to change it in the torrc file and restart your tor process (or send
it a HUP signal).  Maybe you edited the wrong torrc file?  You could
try to move it away and see if your tor still starts.
All the best,
