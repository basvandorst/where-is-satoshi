@_subject: [tor-talk] dnsleaktest.com results - why so many DNS servers? 
I understand that the exit node server does the DNS resolution.? I just wanted to clarify a couple of things when using dnsleaktest.com
I am using 31.172.8.10 which is chaoscomputerclub18.
I assume there are 8 DNS servers (see below) 'just in case' several collapse simultaneously.? Correct?
And, I suppose, it doesn't matter if requests are logged e.g. by Level 3 Communications or Google because no-one knows who the Tor client (me) is.? We detected the 8 DNS servers listed below.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Bootstrapping gets stuck at 85% - logs included. 
Tor worked fine until a few days ago.? Then I began to have some problems.? Let me explain.
I use apt-get install tor and run 'tor'. The results are:
May 11 21:19:08.358 [notice] Tor v0.2.2.35 (git-73ff13ab3cc9570d). This is experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity. (Running on Linux i686)

I'll set both SSL3_FLAGS and SSL_OP just to be safe.

May 11 21:19:10.554 [warn] Problem bootstrapping. Stuck at 10%: Finishing handshake with directory server. (No route to host; NOROUTE; count 1; recommendation warn)
This always happens.? It just gets stuck.
Then I try the Tor Browser Bundle.? I am using the latest version which I downloaded yesterday. Here is what the Vidalia client shows when I ./start-tor-browser:
May 11 22:56:30.636 [Notice] Tor v0.2.2.35 (git-b04388f9e7546a9f). This is experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity. (Running on Linux i686)

May 11 23:01:04.587 [Notice] Tor now sees network activity. Restoring circuit build timeout recording. Network was down for 66 seconds during 1 circuit attempts.
Or I might see:
May 12 07:12:33.787 [Warning] Problem bootstrapping. Stuck at 85%: Finishing handshake with first hop. (DONE; DONE; count 10; recommendation warn)
I then use the Tor Browser Bundle with a VPN.? It works quickly and effectively.
Why does the original 'tor' get stuck at 10%.? Why does the Browser Bundle get stuck at 85%?? Why does the VPN work?
Finally, the Browser Bundle gives an error at ./start-tor-browser:
Qt: Session management error: None of the authentication protocols specified are supported
Does this matter and, if so, what can I do about it?? I am using Ubuntu 10.04.
Many thanks!

Hi, Further to yesterday's e-mail, here are some detailed logs which explain my problem.
Is the problem circuit_build_times_set_timeout_worker(): and, if so, how to deal with it.
The logs below should a non-VPN connection (connection via a VPN does work).
Thanks - help really appreciated!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is my ISP censoring my access to Tor? 
I can no longer connect to the Tor Network.? I used to be able to use it perfectly well.
I would be very grateful for any help.? I've spent several hours trying to deal with this issue!
My ISP has either irrationally started to block Tor or there is some weird configuration error.? I can use Tor fine on different networks (e.g. at cafes with wireless networks).
I am using the latest version of the Tor Browser bundle under Ubuntu 10.04.
The logs below should explain what happens.? I suspect that the key error is:

The circuit building is definitely timing out.? I'm no expert.
Is this correct?? Shouldn't it be Socks listening on port 9050; control listener on port 9051 - or does that matter?
The torrc file shows (SocksPort auto) which I guess randomises the port.
Are you using the same machine / same TBB installation at home as at the cafe wifi?
How many times has this happened at home? - is it a regular thing now?? If not, possible the home ISP server's just busy.? How fast is your If you haven't, try closing TBB, make sure that all Tor services are stopped - then restart TBB.? I've had Tor / TBB fail to connect in the past & wasn't my ISP.? Occasionally, reinstalling (or in this case, re-extracting files to new folder) solved the problem.? Have you looked at TBB Firefox network proxy settings to check they are correct?
However, the most relevant aspect is this:
When I load a VPN and then run Tor it works!!!
How come?

Starting when?? I'm using 2.2.35-11 & the only thing in my unedited torrc file is
"SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1"
You must have checked in Vidalia settings >Advanced, "Configure ContolPort Automatically."? I assume that option is not checked by default?? It isn't in my settings & the Tor logs only show ports 9050 / 9051 being used.? Not that would necessarily make a difference.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is my ISP censoring my access to Tor? 
May I ask what ISP? Have you tried specifying bridges, or selecting the option that says "My ISP blocks tor"?
I also cannot obtain bridges from within Vidalia as the SSL connection fails.
But, as mentioned, when I use a VPN I can then connect to Tor via it.? But never without it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor + VPN + DNS (?) 
I think that if I run Tor with a VPN (and that the VPN does the DNS) then Tor will still do the DNS at the exit node.
Me ----> VPN ----> Tor Node 1 -----> Tor Node 2 ------> Tor Node 3 (exit node) -----> Internet
Thanks.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidalia Greys Out. 
I am using the Tor Browser Bundle under Ubuntu 10.04.
However, Vidalia invariably greys out when running Firefox.
This is annoying since I want to see the bandwidth usage and message log.
It means I can only kill Vidalia with killall -9.
Is there a way to deal with this problem?
Thanks.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor + VPN + DNS (?) 
Thanks - yes, this is what I think happens:
Client (me) ---> Tor Node 1 ---> Tor Node 2 ---> Tor Node 3 (exit node) ---> Internet (HTTP or HTTPS).
Internet (HTTP or HTTPS) ---> Tor Node 3 ---> Tor Node 2 ---> Tor Node 1 ---> Client (me).
The DNS is done remotely at Tor Node 3 (exit node).
All traffic from the client to Tor Node 3 is encrypted.? This includes the headers (IP address of the destination) and body of the message.
The client's ISP can only see that the client (me) has connected to the IP address of Tor Node 1.? That's it.? Nothing more.
Tor plus VPN:
Client (me) ---> VPN ---> Tor Node 1 ---> Tor Node 2 ---> Tor Node 3 (exit node) ---> Internet (HTTP or HTTPS).
Internet (HTTP or HTTPS) ---> Tor Node 3 ---> Tor Node 2 ---> Tor Node 1 ---> VPN ---> Client (me).
The ISP can only see that the client (me) has connected to the IP address of the VPN.
The VPN owner can only see that the client (me) had connected from my IP address (provided by my ISP) and requests to connect to the IP address of Tor Node 1.
All traffic from the client is first encrypted by Tor and then sent to the VPN which adds its own encryption.? The VPN will decrypt its encryption after the traffic exists the VPN system.? The Tor encryption continues until Tor Node 3.
The return journey will show the Tor encrypted traffic pass through the Tor system until it gets to Tor Node 1 and then enters the VPN system which will add its encryption.? Then, when the traffic reaches the client (me), the VPN will decrypt its encyrption, and then Tor will decrypt its traffic.
Many thanks!? I appreciate your time and help.

If you use a VPN and then connect to Tor, assuming your application is
sending all packets through Tor's socks proxy, then the answer would be yes!
