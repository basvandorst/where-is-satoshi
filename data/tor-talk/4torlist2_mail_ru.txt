@_subject: [tor-talk] Please filter "Appelbaum"!!!!! 
Tired of reading bullsh*t about Appelbaum! If he did what it is said, should he be prosecuted and sentenced for life, unless one of his victims has enough balls to cut Appelbaum's balls! But anyway harassing HIM online is just for cowards who are well protected under Tor nodes!!!
Anyway what connection with what he has maybe done in his private life, and his job at Tor? If we sould fire anybody great worker who has a dissolute private life, I guess that nobody would work nowhere!
Some here say that it is in fact an attack against TOR. Maybe, but anyway if it is, the best way to help Tor's team to carry on their good work is to ignore these accusations and concentrate on Tor!
In my mail program I setup a filter on the word "Appelbaum", messages with it are automatically trashed. But that should have been done by the Tor-List admins at the list level! Censorship is sometimes necessary, sorry to have to say this, when some ass*oles by their stupid attitude in fact attack the whole Tor system.
