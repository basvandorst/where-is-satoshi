By correctly setting the "In-Reply-To" and "References" headers of your
mail. "In-Reply-To" is to be set to the value of the "Message-ID" header
(the message ID) of the mail you want to reply to. "References" contains
a list of message IDs: the message ID of the mail you're replying to,
the message ID of the mail that previous mail is a reply to and so on.
Unless you're using a completely broken mail client, your mail client
will do that for you automatically if you use the "Reply" or "Reply-all"
