If you can download the files with a slower speed, it would be better if
you are watching the whole video.
If you only watch part of it then streaming would be better.
Just my intuition.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Helping with the website 
Hi tor talk
I really want to help and where I would like to participate is with the
website, I think there are a few things that can be improved for newcomers
in terms of making it more understandable, also some better directions and
tutorials for developers on how to host their website on tor onion services.
But it looks to be that the tor website is not part of the git repo like it
used to?
Best regards

Hi Yosem That sounds pretty interesting!
How many people are working in the unit?

I think the website is good, I felt before that it left out newcomers that
didn't know what torbrowser was already, so much was going on that it would
confuse people that just have heard others mention tor browser and want to
check it out.
I think there is still space for more nerdy pages and I think anyone is
allowed to create such a page if they want +1
The only thing I am missing is some call to actions for different parts of
the website when you have done scrolling to the bottom of the page 😄

@_subject: [tor-talk] My experience contributing to any Tor Project projects 
Hi Tor users and contributors
I wrote down my thoughts about how to feels like getting started
contributing to the tor project.
Last year I did successfully submit a couple of changes to
support.torproject.org that is awesome to see deployed! But it was mostly
because of the awesome people on that team because everything else felt
like it worked against me making any contributions just because how pieces
of information are spread out.
I will love to hear what you think! What triggered this what I was trying
to report a bug and again meet all the different systems, but I did manage
to create it What my point is that I am not just hating and have tried my best to use
the systems before I talk about them, so my experience is authentic as
possible :)

Hi Georg
Thank you so much for your reply, yeah the Tor Project covers a lot and I
think that is both a blessing and a curse :-D
relays, UX research, training non-technical users, software porting and
patching... and it would be unique, just like yours.
I think it would be awesome to read your experience, shorter than mine is
probably better, about what is important to know to contribute to the parts
that you like in the Tor Project. Would you write such a post?
Yeah the same about the previous, it can become easy to criticize and I
really didn't want to do it with this post, but more highlight how it feels
coming from some other projects that are way more centralized. The focus
should be how easy is it to make a change.

You should submit a patch, that would be a great way to move the
conversation forward 😄

What did you find in your Google research that didn't answer it?

I am really glad you like the post, it means a lot you wrote that!
If you want to help with the website you should reach out to the UX Team that you can find in the Trac wiki.
