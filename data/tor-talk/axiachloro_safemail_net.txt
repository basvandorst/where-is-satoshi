@_subject: [tor-talk] Searching a contributor of yours 
Good morning,
I'm searching for an old contributor of yours called arkmd.
I didn't get response from his contact channels and was wondering if anyone have have contact or a clue where to find it.
I'm a IT researcher and I'm gathering some known names from the Tor Project scene comming from Europe, Brazil and Japan initially to help me in a article (with anonymous Q&A interview) and ask permission to use some of their's stuff (pieces of text from blogs for example) for a webinar presentation.
Thank you in advance, at least to read until here.
