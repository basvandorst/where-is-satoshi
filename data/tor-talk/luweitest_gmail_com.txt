@_subject: signature of Tor release 
Seems my first message from Gmane gateway was killed, so I repost this
again. I noticed that the signature of Tor release was changed from
0x31B0974B, "Andrew Lewman (phobos) " to 0x63FEE659,
"Erinn Clark ". Is it correct? Was there any announcement?

My previous post refers to the vidalia-bundle, maybe you refer to other
release. vidalia-bundle-0.2.1.26-0.2.9.exe is signed by 0x31B0974B at
2010-5-26, it only changed in the latest vidalia-bundle-0.2.1.27-0.2.10.exe.
Yes, so I have no more doubts. Thank you.

Even if tor has retrieved 1260 relays, even if tor connect through 20+
bridges, circuit cannot be established. Sometimes after hundreds of
"[Warning] Problem bootstrapping. Stuck at xx%: Finishing handshake with
first hop. (DONE; DONE; count xxx; recommendation warn)" it says
connected to tor network, but if I issue a browser request, path failed
again (it just opens new paths and failed quickly). It seems to me tor
mechanism has been defeated. Or do I need a secret bridge? If someone is
kind enough please give me a secret bridge to test (not on the
 not retrievable through mail request to
bridges at torproject.org).
Could someone confirm that tor has been defeated in china? I mean
running tor natively, not "capped" or through another proxy.

Thank you for the confirmation. Someone kindly gave me a private bridge,
it failed yesterday but worked today. I think that's because it's a
dynamic address. Fortunately they have not blocked all dynamic DNS
service. Only a little inconvenience is that bridge address must be
entered digitally.
Most people use products from internetfreedom.org, as vpns and proxies,
they are not designed specifically for anonymity, but availability and
speed. Although chained usage with tor is possible, the performance is
drastically slow.
Do you have plan to implement some friend-to-friend mechanism? The
ultimate threat is that any publicly retrievable data could also be
retrieved by the admins. A little off topic; Looking forward to your
good news.

I use vidalia bundle for windows version, on which the accepted syntax is:
Bridge : So I have to do a nslookup every time before starting. What's more, the
actual syntax that functions is:
Bridge :
 cannot be present. I hear that it's because fingerprint
checking is blocked.

@_subject: [tor-talk] abnormal bridge usage since September 
Stumbled upon metrics.torproject.org/users.html , and found an
interesting thing about the graph of "Tor users via bridges". There's a
burst of bridge usage since about September 25, which correspond with
the recent spasm of chinese gfw, and extensive failure of GIFC's
products. My first impression is: wow, chinese users contributes the
main usage of tor bridge; but when I select other countries, they show
exactly the same trends!
So, as other countries should not cooperate with chinese gfw so closely,
I guess, the statistics of "Tor users via bridges" may incorrect; or,
the worse case, besides the attack towards GIFC, chinese gov also
launched attack towards tor's bridges, from all over the globe, to hide
its chinese origin.
