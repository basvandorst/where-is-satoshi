Forwarded conversation
     I have followed, to the best of my ability, the guides and manuals
used to connect to Tor through a different device than my relay.  I have
been attempting to connect a Wii console to the internet through Tor.  The
snag is that the Wii only supports proxies through HTTP and HTTPS.  I
thought that if I could connect directly to Polipo through the Wii that I
might be able to filter the connection into something usable by Tor, but
advanced Polipo support for Windows is lacking (or at least in simplicity).
 I can connect my Wii to Tor, but I am greeted with the notice that my
browser is attempting to use Tor as an HTTP proxy, which Tor does not allow.
Is there any such way to connect a device to a computer running Tor if the
device's browser does not support SOCKS?  I was hoping to find a connection
relaying program of some kind, but it's all a bit too confusing.  I'll try
anything, as long as I can understand it.

Is it sufficient to have Polipo listen for the Wii's IP, or should I have
it listen on the whole network?
If I have the Vidalia Bundle is this handled automatically?
port provided by polipo.
All of this is turning out to be incredibly unclear thanks to the poor
writing of Polipo's instructions and user guides.  Following to the best of
my ability, I've come up with these changes to the configuration file
"polipo.conf".  I'm sure I still did something wrong.

-_- It works now.
ether and expect everything to just work.
It turns out I was misunderstanding what "proxyAddress" meant.  Polipo is
tragically unclear; If they mentioned that  "proxyAddress = address on your
network through which the other device >will use as a proxy<" it would have
saved me a ton of time and effort.
All in all, it's a matter of lazy convenience.  I prefer to browse through
a computer with a secure browser (Opera with Tor is sufficient for my
needs), but that is not an option due to recent hardware failures.  This
old desktop will likely crash if I try to use a Tor browser, and isn't
compatible with the latest PC and Windows security updates.  Some of the
mistakes I made are from following "canned solutions", which is reckless,
but I'd rather make all of the mistakes I can before I actually come to
need such important security measures as Tor.  All in all, this setup will
allow me to do what I need and the rest will be on a combination of my
habits and plausible deniability (the Wii doesn't keep a browser history) ;)
Thanks, folks.
...also, when I brag to other people that I'm the first person to do this,
I might need to "borrow" those technical warnings.  Hope you people don't
