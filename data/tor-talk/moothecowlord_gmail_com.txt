@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor bridge delivery method 
This is my first post here.
I have recently watched a video of a conference where Tor developers
discuss the arms race engaged between them and various governments to shut
down access to the Tor network.
I have come out with the outline of a design to a mid term solution for Tor
bridge address distribution that would circumvent DPI surveillance and
probing attacks, with an estimated development time of at least 4-6 months.
I would like to know if there is any need for such project and if this is
the right place to discuss it.
Regards, goat.

Hi Andrew,
I have read those 2 links. The design I'm thinking of would be resistant to
probing attacks presented in the "ten ways to discover bridges" article in
that it would modify the bridge protocol to be "semi" public. The basic
idea is to perform hand shaking between the bridge and the client in a 3rd
party server without delivering information to either of them until it has
been established the client can be forwarded to the bridge, which will then
be listening for that particular IP.
This method is based on the premise that client certificates can be
distributed to individuals on site. It's weakness is for attackers to gain
access to a valid client certificate, so this bridge delivery method will
be at its highest efficiency if it is used to provide high connectivity to
a limited amount of key individuals.
I need a couple questions answered before i can proceed further:
1) Can I assume client certificates may be distributed safely to people in
hostile zones?
2) Is this the right place to discuss the design in details?
