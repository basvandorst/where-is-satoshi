@_subject: mixmaster policies (was Re: Update to default exit policy) 
one question related to the port 465/587 thread.
Could it be useful to open at least the ports for mixmaster remailers,
capable of submission via TLS, SSL connections or SMTP (2525)?

@_subject: Strange problem with Tor/Scroogle 
I have sent them an e-mail three days ago because of this issue and
asked, if they are blocking Tor, but got no answer.

@_subject: Scroogle is allowing Tor again [Was: Re: Strange problem with 
forwarded with David Brandts permission:
Scroogle's six servers have been under an around-the-clock flooding
that is coming through Tor. Until today, this has been going on for
eight days without any let-up.
They came into Scroogle in the form of one of three GET requests
for a search. They use DNS lookups of  because
they hit only our servers that were currently in our DNS. Curiously,
they also picked up our favicon.ico consistently, which in restrospect
seems to suggest a misconfigured machine. Anyway, it slowed to a crawl
about ten hours ago.
The three search terms requested are easy to catch:
1)  damian+conway+perl
2)  osman+semerci+-fired
3)  issam+fares+-kanaan
We lifted our Tor blocks about an hour ago. Only a few per hour are
coming through by now, which we are handling directly based on the
search terms instead of trying to block all Tor exit nodes.
Originally we thought that someone was using Scroogle to scan for
possible Tor exit nodes. We chose to use null-route blocking to
defeat this, because a "Forbidden" would merely confirm that the
circuit found its intended destination.
Then we thought that whoever is doing this is anti-Tor as much as
anti-Scroogle, and that it was an attempted denial of service.
Now we think it was an out-of-control machine and that it was
turned off earlier today.

@_subject: "RequestPolicy": can people take a look at it? 
I have RP installed beside NoScript, but without Torbutton.
It coexists very well with NoScript, you can allow/disallow all requests
to external "base domains", "full domains" and "full addresses", but
Scripts etc. from such domains and adresses are only allowed/disallowed
with the additional actions & functions from NoScript. The author says,
that he sees RP as an addition to NoScript. The context menu / handling
 is like NoScript or FoxyProxy. No blacklists so far and the whitelists
are static - you cannot edit the entries or use wildcards /RegEx
(requested and added to his list of planned features). Perhaps RP's
functions could or will be incorporated in things like NoScript,
Torbutton...don't know.
I have written a short German-language review in
but you can follow
 too ;)

@_subject: gwget and tor? 
i'm using this little script for one-time wget downloads over privoxy &
tor in the terminal or as a "download manager" together with the
FlashGot Firefox extension:
wget \
-e http_proxy= \
-e https_proxy= \
--tries=3 \
--no-dns-cache \
--inet4-only \
--directory-prefix=/opt/downloads \
--no-check-certificate \ *
--no-cookies \
--user-agent="Mozilla..." \
text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8" \
--header="Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5" \
--header="Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate" \
--header="Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7" \
* depends on your needs - you can check certificates with the opposite
and further "certificate" options.

save as e. g. "wget_anon" (edit the user-agent header line or delete all
header lines), chmod 750 wget_anon and than $ wget_anon URL. Or with the
FlashGot extension (as an example):
Add-> Name: wget_anon
Executable path: /path/wget_anon
Command line argument: [URL]
as i said, i'm using it for a download of one file, but you can type
wget_anon URL1
wget_anon URL2 ...
or expand the variable or with FashGot you can click several files or
use the "FlashGot All" function to suck a whole webpage. Perhaps another
ml member has better or additional ideas :)
