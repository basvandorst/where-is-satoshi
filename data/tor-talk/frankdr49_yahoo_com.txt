@_subject: [tor-talk] Using passwords with TOR 
I've used Tor for a while but rarely to login to personal accounts.
With tor being about?anonymity?and all this might be redundant but is it safe to do this or is my password able to get picked up by whoever is relaying my connection?
Thanks in advance.
