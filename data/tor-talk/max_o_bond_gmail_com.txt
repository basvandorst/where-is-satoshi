Make sure your webserver is only listening for connections from the local
host, otherwise people connecting to it from the normal Internet can
observe they see the same content on your IP as they do on your hidden
service and compromise your anonymity.

Have you tried this over multiple circuits? Is it possible your DNS
provider is the one doing something naughty?

I was thinking of the DNS server which was responsible for their domain. If
this is a persistent problem they've encountered over multiple circuits, it
seems to me far more likely that their DNS provider is to blame.

@_subject: [tor-talk] ISP CenturyLink Blocking Tor? 
I've been using CenturyLink for ADSL in the US for five or six years
(coincidentally this is my last day with them, so I probably won't be able
to do much testing), and I have never had a problem using Tor; as soon as I
saw this thread, I fired up Tor Browser and accessed a few websites. I
didn't use pluggable transports and everything went smoothly.
I can confirm that restarting the router changes the IP address, and that
they have some level of remote management (I've noticed them installing
firmware updates to my router.)
I've never heard of this "protection program" but I doubt its the cause.
I've never known it to be zealous, let alone overzealous; I scanned about
twenty-five thousand, multiple times, to gather statistics. I never heard a
peep out of
them. I imagine that they'd watch for large volumes of obvious attack
traffic before they targeted Tor, from a malware perspective.
All that being said, perhaps this is a regional difference.
Hope that helps,

Organized criminals will probably achieve better operational security by
conducting themselves in the real world as much as possible. This is not an
option available to a lone dissident in an oppressed country.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Revoking a hidden service key 
It seems like the only way this scheme could work is if the directories
remembered which services had issued revocations, making compromises
expensive for the whole network and opening the door for denial-of-service
attacks that effect hidden services as a whole.
I would counter propose that you set up a Twitter account which tweets
about the status of your hidden service, where you could make an emergency
announcement. Perhaps you could have a passcode required to enter the site
that changes on a daily basis and is announced from twitter, so that your
users get in the habit of checking twitter before logging in to your site.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Use of TOR for illegal activities 
That claim was and is hearsay.
Accepting the people using Tor "in [that] way", no one is happy that Tor is
occasionally used to hurt people. But we are playing a zero sum game. Math
is amoral, and ciphers have no way of determining if they bytes they're
encrypting represent images of cats or of nude figures. There is no clever
way to write code that ensures we can censor the speech of child
pornographers, but not political dissidents.
There will always be bad actors. We can't throw out the baby in the
bathwater by saying, "no one can use Tor because child pornographers must
not use Tor." That might help us with some problems, but it cripples us
against abusive governments and the like. Deciding what people can and
cannot do with their free speech, and the consequences for crossing that
line, is a social problem that can only be solved through social means.

@_subject: [tor-talk] someone doesn't like my IP 
Either they're blocking all Tor exits, or that exit in particular got on a
list of naughty IPs because someone used it to launch attacks, send spam,
or other things people don't like.
Try a few more exits until you get one that works or give up trying. In Tor
browser, you'd click on the onion menu and click "New identity." If you're
not using Tor browser, you'll need to send the Tor daemon the newnym signal
(if you don't want to look up how to do that, the cheap hack is to stop Tor
and then restart it.)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Need someone to provide me with info on TOR 
Hello D M,
It is important to keep in mind that Tor is not a "product" - its a labor
of love created by a large group of talented people who do their best. It
isn't a turnkey solution; you don't install it, double click an icon, and
now you've regained your online privacy. It is a tool that can, when
understood and used with care, can help you evade surveillance.
But it is less of a simple tool, like a hammer, and more of a power tool,
like a jigsaw. It isn't obvious how to use it properly. If used improperly,
not only will it fail to solve your problem, you'll be worse off than you
were before. Be very careful in your research before deciding Tor is a good
idea for your situation.
And yes, it is pretty slow.
