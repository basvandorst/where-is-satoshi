"Are you running anything at that port? Try "netstat -ln |grep 9101".
You could also try running "grep -R 9101 /etc/*" to see if 9101 is mentioned in any config under the /etc.
I blocked the port at the time and did'nt think about netstat, but it was an active connection.

oops.. I'm a mailing list rookie (your answer landed in the junk mail box and I didn't notice that and replied my own mail.. sorry!)
I just blocked the service port (at the time) and didn't think about netstat . But.. it was an active connection (according to Firestarter).

Is my box hacked, or is everything in order?
It looks very very weird to me, anyway, that "wsip-70-169-134-190.hr.hr.cox.net" is connecting to Bacula-dir.
