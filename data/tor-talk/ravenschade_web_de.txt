@_subject: A map of the TOR network (geolocation) 
Please take a look at  , where you
can find the location of all TOR-Servers on a map.
In order to create this maps I'm using a geolocation service and the ip
addresses from the directory server.
On my page you can find 2 different maps:
1. The first one is using a free Flash-applet and javascript.
2. The second one is made for people, who think that javascript is a
risk for their anonymity. This map is created from pure html and public
domain maps.
I would be very grateful for your ideas about my maps.
Please consider that the maps are still in testing.

@_subject: tls and connection hacking 
Just a question:
Can anyone tell me how to properly connect to the tor or-port (mostly
port 9001) so that tor accepts my connection, without telling me that I
did not send a certificate.
(I've already tried the standart tlsv1-client)
Why I need this:
I'm trying to do a fuzz test on tor, but you have to make a valid tlsv1
connection in order to fuzz the inner functions of tor.
yours sincerly

@_subject: tls 
I'm not familiar with the tls implementation in tor and how to reproduce it in another part of code. I've already looked at the spec.
But my problem is to send a certificate chain.
"During the TLS handshake, the connection initiator always sends a
   two-certificate chain, consisting of an X.509 certificate using a
   short-term connection public key and a second, self- signed X.509
   certificate containing its identity key."
may you can help me.
Check out section 2 of tor-spec.txt, at
    tor.eff.org/svn/trunk/doc/spec/tor-spec.txt
The earlier sections may help with notation and terminology.
