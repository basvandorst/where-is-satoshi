@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor over SSH (torsocks) (?) 
I would also like to know this. SSH hidden service setup and use are
easy with torsocks.
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/ssh_service/
HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
torsocks ssh user at xxx.onion
works like a charm.
Can anyone comment on security of torsocks?
