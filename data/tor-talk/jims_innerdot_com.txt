@_subject: Setting up a Tor private network 
I'm in the process of playing around with Tor (beyond just using it  as a client -- using it as a client has been no problem).  In so  doing, I am attempting to first set up a "tor private network" on a  system and see how things work when running a couple of tor server  processes.  I am using the make-private-tor-network.py (I've also  tried hand configuring) but things do not appear to work.
In the debug log, I am consistently seeing the following debug  Oct 04 01:12:50.107 [info] router_have_minimum_dir_info(): We have 0  of 1 network statuses, and we want more than 0.
Is there something I am missing?  It doesn't look lik eroutes are  being established.  Each of the non-directory nodes does connect and  give information to the directory node, but that appears to be it.   Is there a better writeup/discussion on setting up a private tor  And for the record, this is on both OS X and Linux -- the behaviour  is consistent.
