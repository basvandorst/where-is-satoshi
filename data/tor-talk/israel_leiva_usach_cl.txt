I noticed the spanish translation has some issues with "user / pw". I used
a shorter version but I believe it still exceeds the maximun length (by one
character). May be you could decrease a little bit the font there?
I also changed some words that seemed too literal for me (key, data
sharing, eavesdropping). Last, I believe "Nodo Tor" is easier to understand
that "Repetidor Tor". Any opinion on this from spanish speakers?
Thanks for the work.
