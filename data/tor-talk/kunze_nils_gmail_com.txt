@_subject: [tor-talk] Harvard student used Tor to send bomb threats, 
"A Harvard student has been charged with using an anonymous email address
and Tor to disguise his identity, and then sending a bomb threat to get out
of a final exam. What's remarkable to me that he was caught despite taking
smart steps to hide his identity. Here's the FBI affidavit explaining how
they caught him: [2]"
Apparently he used Tor in the university network to send the emails via
Guerrilla Mail. The university was able to figure out which student used
Tor in their network before the emails where sent and he then confessed
when confronted.
I thought this might be of interest!

Unless... this is just a setup to make Tor look like it's not controlled by
the US goverment :-P

2013/10/17 mick While tone of voice is always hard to get across in a written medium, it
seems quite obvious to me that Joe is not suggesting what you are
paraphrasing, but in fact just bringing a point across: It is not going to
be possible to know the identity and intentions of all relay operators and
hence it is necessary that tor can provide anonymity even in face of the
possibility that some relays are run by adversaries.

As these requests will be sent out via the tor network, this will not leak
your real ip but just the ip of your exit relay, which is known anyways.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB 3.5 starts w/ size buttons hidden 
You can use the windows key + an arrow key to resize and move windows. So
for example win + left arrow to make the window take over the left half of
the screen. With that you should be able to put it in the position you like
