Android 2.2 uses iptables 1.4.7., iptables changed the behaviour
regarding the nat table on 1.4.3, so simply the old rules don't work.
A workaround would be to set the iptables-rules via adb shell or your
terminal/shell script/... (like
but your "DNS"-destination-port is 5400)
If noone else goes for a patched version, I'd test my build host with
Orbot 0.0.8 next weekend.

released in the market. So the former post is quite useless. Sorry for
