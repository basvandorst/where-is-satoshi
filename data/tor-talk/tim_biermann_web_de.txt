Well, I missed to mention:
You still have to run ulimit - somehow the shell seems to handle this "Zu unserer Besserung bed?rfen wir eines Spiegels." - Arthur Schopenhauer

Hi all,
at first, sorry for the long topic name.. could not think of anything
I had a problem with Tor on my NetBSD (4.0.1) box, it said:
Mar 15 17:51:09.357 [warn] We need 1000 file descriptors available, and
we're limited to 956. Please change your ulimit -n.
Mar 15 17:51:09.359 [warn] Failed to parse/validate config: Problem with
ConnLimit value. See logs for details.
ulimit doesnt help, because it would just set the current running
Thanks to the guys in  on freenode, i discovered that you have to
control that through sysctl.
So, sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=3D8000 should do the job.
You can add this to /etc/sysctl.conf to apply the settings on boot time.
If you discovered the same problem on another system and try this
solution, let me know if it worked out.
