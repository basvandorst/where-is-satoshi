Currently I am using VPS's at Prgmr.com and Digitalocean, for more
secure stuff I prefer Prgmr because they don't depend on a web
interface that can be cracked.  If you want it for Wordpress, perhaps
security isn't that much of an issue.  I haven't run tor node at
Prgmr.com.  Prgrmr might not be the level of tech support you want as
it is very minimal and intended for experienced admins who are more
comfortable with the command line.
