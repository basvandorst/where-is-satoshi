I have some warnings in my tor log like below:
Oct 06 19:56:01.279 [notice] Tor 0.1.1.23 opening log file.
Oct 06 19:56:01.610 [notice] Your Tor server's identity key

Looks like client functionality is working.

Excellent. Publishing server descriptor.
Oct 06 19:56:20.320 [warn] connection_dir_client_reached_eof(): http
status 400 ("Dirserver believes your ORPort is unreachable") response
from dirserver '86.59.21.38:80'. Please correct.

Can some give me directions how te correct this? I have Googled but
can't find a answer.
On that server I have redirect the port:
minidragon:~$ sudo iptables -t nat -n -L
Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
REDIRECT   tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            192.168.1.10        tcp
dpt:443 redir ports 9001
REDIRECT   tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            192.168.1.10        tcp
dpt:80 redir ports 9030
And it seems to work correctly beside the warning.

First thanks for your reply, i hope i can fix it, could it be related
that i changed the listening port to 443, 80 and the redirection with
I changed the ports and did set iptables with:
iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING --src 0/0 --dst 192.168.1.10 -p tcp
--dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 9030
iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING --src 0/0 --dst 192.168.1.10 -p tcp
--dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 9001
sircrow at minidragon:~$ sudo iptables -t nat -n -L
Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
REDIRECT   tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            192.168.1.10        tcp
dpt:443 redir ports 9001
REDIRECT   tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            192.168.1.10        tcp
dpt:80 redir ports 9030
The firewall is actual a modem/router (Livebox) and does nothing more then
213.17.104.91:9001 => 192.168.1.10:9001
213.17.104.91:9030 => 192.168.1.10:9030
If there is no solution i could try to setup Tor again to listen on 9001,9030

I hope i did find it :-)
Added to /etc/init.d/rc.local
if [ -e /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn ]
     echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn
Maybe somebody can test it.

@_subject: Using a network monitor when tor is running. 
I'm new to Tor and can't find a satisfying answer to the following
question, i want to monitor my traffic on my server where also Tor is
running, does a traffic monitor like bmon or iptraf compromise the
anonymity of Tor, or in other words does it affect the good working of
Tor running as a middle man?
