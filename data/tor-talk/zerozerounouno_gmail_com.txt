@_subject: PPC-only privoxy in OSX bundle 
I just downloaded and installed the latest Vidalia bundle for OSX
(vidalia-bundle-0.2.1.19-0.1.15-universal), and noticed that the
privoxy task still appears to be PowerPC-only in Activity Monitor.
Does anyone know why? Has privoxy ever been built as a universal
executable? Is DIY the only solution?
