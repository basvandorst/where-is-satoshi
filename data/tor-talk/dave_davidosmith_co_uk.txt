@_subject: Using Tor under Parallels 
I'm running an Intel-based Mac with Tor and Privoxy installed and
working. I'm also running Windows XP under Parallels on the same Mac.
I'm using Firefox on the Windows system.
Firefox on the Windows Virtual Machine won't connect to the net. I've
configured it to use the Proxy settings recommended on the web page
(Proxy at 127.0.0.1/port 8118/Socks 5). All I get is a message that the
proxy is refusing connections. How do I get round this, please?

@_subject: Vidalia 0.0.8 
I understood that the latest version of Vidalia was 0.0.8. I've just
downloaded and installed the Tor 0.1.1.25 bundle for Mac OSX (Tiger) and
find I'm still on Vidalia 0.0.7.
Is Vidalia 0.0.8 not available for OS X 10.4? If so, how do I get it?

That will be because your PATH environment variable for "nobody" doesn't
include /usr/local/bin
You can change this by doing something like:
export PATH
The actual command format will depend on what shell you're running.
