@_subject: h07onion is back for good 
Hi there.
I'm happy to announce that the h07onion is back online
with the same amount of ressources as before.
(100mbit/s, 500gig/month)
The new host is stoneddaemon.net,
h07onion 5C57 D9C9 BDDD A55C 3C9E A9D9 DB8B 592D DE31 4DA2
We've canceled our contract with PlusServer ISP.
PlusServer has shut down server3.h07.org (and thus the h07onion)
after someone used a cracked version of VisualRoute
over the tor network and our node as exit point.

That's pretty trivial:
---BEGIN SCRIPT---
while( sleep 1 ) {
        my $ReturnCode = system( '/usr/local/bin/tor -f /etc/torrc' );
        last unless $ReturnCode;
---END SCRIPT---
But you could just use this command:
perl -e "while(sleep 1){\$r=system('tor -f /etc/torrc');last unless \$r;}"

I just realized that there is an even simpler solution to that.
just run the following command with ksh (or bash):
until tor;do true;done

Well, an obsolete tor exits with 0,
so the loop breaks.

@_subject: systrace policy 
Hi folks.
I've written a basic systrace(1) policy for tor nodes logging to syslog.
It was tested under OpenBSD 3.8/x86 with tor .9.2 and .9.4.
I'm looking forward to get comments, suggestions and uh flames :)

@_subject: another policy, privoxy this time 
Hello again.
I was bored and so I've just written another basic systrace policy.
This one is for privoxy and was tested with privoxy v3.0.3 on OpenBSD 3.6/x86.
Others may work too.
Comments, questions and flames ware welcome.

@_subject: privoxy problem on OpenBSD 
Good morning
I'm using OpenBSD 3.6 on x86 with tor 0.0.9.2 and the privoxy version found in the ports.
The Firefox is also from the ports.
I haven't experienced any problems yet.
Mail me if you want more information (config files or such).

@_subject: h07onion shut down by isp 
Hi folks.
I just want to inform you that the tor node h07onion,
as well as the server where it did run on (server3.h07.org)
were shut down by our ISP.
It seems as someone used a cracked version of VisualRoute
over the tor network and the h07onion happend to be the exit node.
At least we can learn something from this:
- VisualRoute is spyware
- gross incompetence can be found at PlusServer ISP
I can't tell if and when the h07onion will be up again,
since the internal discussion in the h07 unix development team isn't over yet.

this will not work
you have to use a tsocks wrapper like the "torify" script wich is included in the tor distribution.

@_subject: script to magically restart tor [was: Re: disappearing nodes] 
I've written a little perl script to do that a couple of weeks ago.
It's nothing fancy,
but may save you the 10 minutes it takes to hack it yourself.
