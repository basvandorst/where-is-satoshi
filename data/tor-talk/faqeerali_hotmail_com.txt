@_subject: javaprogram using tor 
i build the tor, privoxy from source and configured and installed it, it works fine.
I have writen a small java program which uses JavaMail api to send an Email. It want that my java program uses tor, so that the email sender would not be known through the messege headers of emails. i have searched the FAQ's and find the Torlib, and i cannot find where to download it or any sample of it.  And cannot find exactly how can i use it in my program.
Is there any other way to connect my java program to "tor", or kindly point me to something useful..
  Thanks.

i have checked this " and uninstall all the plugins like flash. i have now got these plugins installed which i check from "install:plugins".
1)    File name: libtotem-basic-plugin.so
    The Totem 2.16.1 plugin handles video and audio streams.
   2) File name: libtotem-complex-plugin.so
    The Totem 2.16.1 plugin handles video and audio streams.
3) Windows Media Player Plug-in 10 (compatible; Totem)
    File name: libtotem-gmp-plugin.so
4)DivX? Web Player
    File name: libtotem-mully-plugin.so
Do i have to uninstall any other out of the above 4.
i have open this page:  and it states that you are probably using tor. That means tor is congured alright.
The reciever is using this software on windows  for geting information about the sender.
Any other suggesstion which i have to use while sending email through tor...

i have read the instructions of tor installation.
i have configured my browser using torbutton,  and for email i am using web, and what about configuring internet connection?
you can refer to my couple of prev emails to see which plugins i have installed in mozilla-firefox.
i have gone to the check page also, and it states: you are probably using tor.
viking: i have also sent an email at vikingserver at gmail.com
