@_subject: Tor a carrier for Botnet traffic? 
The Tor anonimity network is a generic carrier for all kinds of (TCP)
traffic. Its goal is enabling people to use the internet without anyone
between them and the destination point being able to determine what is
happening. It also allows you to offer services without anyone being
able to trace back these services to you.
Now botnets need to communicate with a central instance which lets them
know what to do (e.g. send spam, ddos websites, etc.). Tor is an ideal
carrier for this: no outsider can see what kind of traffic comes out of
a system running such a bot and no-one is able to see whereto this
traffic goes. So you can't stop the traffic between the bot and its
master without blocking the whole Tor network and it is kind of hard as
well to find where all this traffic goes to (the botnet master node).
So; what should we do? Dis-allow hidden services in Tor? Or block Tor

Yes, each try.
The tor-server on the ssh side has been running for weeks.

Hi Nils,
Do you think it'll go faster in the future?
And/or did they say anything like "don't use it or you'll get busted again"?

It sounds a little bit like a cripple version of freenet.

Any details known for the netherlands?
As I've heard a couple of cases of tor exit nodes being raided and
never returned (not even after 3 years).

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor versus freenet 
We have Tor, we have Freenet. One is for protecting network sessions,
the other one for data.
In short: can't we combine these two?
Freenet serves a purpose but it is, for the average user, way too
complicated/too much of a hassle to install and work with. Especially
since Java became a target for mallware and everybody now screaming that
you should uninstall it.
Tor on the other hand has nice guis for configuring with which even my
grandparents would be able to work.
What I propose is some kind of shared-folder via which one can share
files over the tor network. Not neccessarily like a windows fileshare
but as a freenet document store. E.g. documents are not on your local
disk but are "on the freenet network" where everyone has (part of) files
stored on his system (in a configurable pool with a certain size).
Finding files could be implemented in the same way as hidden services
are found in the tor network.
This would make it more easy for people in oppressed countries to share
documents with e.g. their findings or photos or videoes etc without the
steep learning curve of ftp clients etc. Ok you could use e-mail for
that but the construction of freenet where data is stored (in parts) on
multiple systems would also prevent bad guys for simply hacking the
e-mail of that person or "persuading" him/her to delete the files.

Tahoe-lafs is not the same.
Freenet, if I understood it correctly, distributes files in blocks over
multiple nodes, not defined by a configuration but by demand. Also, the
blocks are encrypted. So it is not possible to decrypt the blocks on
your system to find out from what kind of files the blocks are, you can
find a file only by its "filename" (+/-), not the other way around.
It is not a matter of tunneling a storage system through the tor
networking as then each node has all data un-encrypted and can be
accounted for that he is that data. With freenet you have a bunch of
encrypted data.
I do not a working version nor any sourcecode for it. Only this vague
idea. Also I don't have time to do it (well, maybe in a year or so, but
currently I'm busy with my other toy projects) but maybe it sparks
interest in someone.

Yes, offsystem sounds like freenet.
But it is another program you have to install, configure and whatnot.
I especially opt for integration in Tor to simply the use.
Yes, freenet has installers etc but it is Java and everybody seems to
hate Java these days and all CERTs seem to advise people to uninstall
