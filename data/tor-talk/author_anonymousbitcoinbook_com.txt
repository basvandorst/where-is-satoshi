If I were going to perform a de-anonymization attack on Tor users en masse, I would take advantage of the fact that TorBrowser and Tails Linux* both load a page with client-side scripting enabled upon startup. How secure is this single point of failure?
I'm also curious if it would be possible to add command-line options for disabling scripts globally via NoScript at startup to Ice Weasel and Tor Browser, so a user could start from the command line using something I realize that TorButton provides some protections, but I'd like to do even better.
*: The current default page for Ice Weasel in Tails is tails.boum.org/news/, but I believe I saw some talk in the Tails mailing list about possibly changing it to blend in better with TorBrowser

Ernie Allen from the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children was a real disappointment, insofar as his statements about anonymity and government control were incredibly myopic.
If your plan to protect children is to initiate force against people of all ages, you're going to have a bad day...

@_subject: [tor-talk] =?utf-8?q?Tips_for_configuring_and_using_Tor_for_anony?= 
Hey all,
I'm writing a book about the use of Bitcoin and anonymity. A fair portion of the book will be dedicated to teaching people how to most safely use Tor to facilitate anonymity with Bitcoin. Are there any special tips that people have for configuring Tor or using Tor when it comes to Bitcoin?
Right now, I'm recommending the use of a LiveCD Linux distro (Ubuntu) with TorBundle for Linux and the vanilla Bitcoin client for Linux. A couple tips I'm already aware of are to disable JavaScript before using (since NoScript currently defaults to being on :() and to avoid downloading files through the web browser such as PDF documents.
In particular, I'm curious 1) if there needs to be special configuration to ensure that all DNS request go through Tor, and 2) whether I can configure the system not to send any internet message except through the Tor proxy.

Thanks, everyone, for the feedback. I decided to go with Tails, which is a far better choice than Ubuntu.

But The People wrote it down on a piece of paper! And worded the request very politely, I might add.

As far as I can tell, the main competitor to Tor, which is far behind in network size, is I2P.

Pay-to-route seems likely in the future for the capitalists amongst participants in P2P routing networks. Bitcoin is as good a medium for that to take place as any, but great care would need to be taken in order not to ruin the anonymity achieved through using Tor. It would be especially tricky to try to dole out payments for each message relayed, but that doesn't mean it can't or won't happen.

By changing the browser fingerprint, do you mean altering the HTTP request headers, such as the User-agent? You'd need to decrypt SSL/TLS traffic in order to modify the headers of any request sent over SSL/TLS, so that limits you to plaintext HTTP traffic.
You COULD alter HTTP request headers at each hop, but let me raise a potential objection: A considerable number of websites return different HTTP responses based on the contents of HTTP request headers, so you'd be potentially mucking up the deterministic output of web applications. A common example is returning a different version of a website when the User-Agent indicates a mobile device. One obvious part of the browser fingerprint is unique cookie values, such as those set by third-party ad domains. Cookies would be one of the trickiest to modify, because they are integral to the function of the vast majority of websites, and it would be difficult when to mutate a cookie value without negatively impacting the function of the web application.

Then the button should read "change exit node" and not "new identity", no?
