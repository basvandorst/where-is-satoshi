@_subject: [tor-talk] Shutting down my tor relay 
I will not shutdown my tor exit relay. If something went wrong (what I am unable to judge from the distance) the reaction cannot be to shutdown relays that are needed by people to get uncensored internet. Operating a tor relay is in the first place a service for the public and not to the Tor Project.
