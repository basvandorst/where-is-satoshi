@_subject: [tor-talk] Can I use a non-Tor exit node? 
I use a service that doesn't allow Tor. But I'd like to use Tor anyway, except at the end of the path where, hopefully, there is a way to use an exit that won't be detected as Tor. Is something like that possible?
I'm new at this - hope that doesn't sound too stupid. Thanks

Can you tell me how to set this up to use a proxy service?  For example, 95.87.239.115 on port 8080.  I assume I'll have to modify the torrc file?  Thanks

@_subject: [tor-talk] Updating Tor Browser Bundle 
While using Tor Browser Bundle, I sometimes get notified about updates that are available.
Is there an easy way to apply the updates while preserving my bookmarks and extensions I've added?  Thanks
