@_subject: Precompiled tor binary for openwrt/dd-wrt? 
I've put a diff for OpenWrt's tor package and binary packages at the
following location: I've tested these packages briefly on my Asus 500g Deluxe.

OpenWrt has /dev/random and /dev/urandom.  The SSH daemon dropbear,
which is installed by default under OpenWrt, uses /dev/urandom.
Isn't it vice versa?  AFAIK /dev/random provides strong random data,
which /dev/urandom doesn't guarantee.
I don't know why the tor binary crashes on the Linksys router.  I
can't reproduce this bug on my Asus router.  I used a current OpenWrt
WhiteRussian build tree to create the binary packages.  So far I never
had problems to mix packages from the current build tree with packages
from WhiteRussian RC5, but maybe something has changed recently.
