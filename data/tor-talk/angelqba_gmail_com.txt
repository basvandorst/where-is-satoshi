@_subject: [tor-talk] using bridges with dns name 
Here is my problem:
The network administrator of my job search the firewall's (squid) log for
anything strange, so when tor connects using a bridge, the firewall's log
23.54.23.32  <<<<<--------- bridge's ip
I get the dns name of the bridge's ip and put it in the configuration of
Vidalia, but the ip keeps showing in the log.
My question is, is there a way to tell tor to use dns names for bridges
instead of ip, in a way that the dns name is registered by the firewall
instead of the ip?
