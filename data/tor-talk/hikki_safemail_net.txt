@_subject: Tor seems to have a huge security risk--please prove me wrong! 
There are a lot of discussions going on over at the Onion Forum, a Tor hidden service board, regarding a possible attack on the Tor's anonymity and safety. It's called "classifier attacks" and seems to be a high probability attack that may in a way unmask the encryption used by Tor, and in addition to that reveal the source as in the user using Tor as the first part of the chain.
This subject seems to be either very unknown or very well silenced. So therefore I'm very interesting about what the users of this mailing list have to say about this.
Here are two concerning posts:

@_subject: Why must Tor continuously contact directory servers? 
When I supervise Tor's traffic, I see that it very often contacts nodes which are directory servers. It's not like +/-2000 nodes change their statuses that fast.
I wish there was a way to reduce this to like 1 time each day or even less, because it adds a lot of unnecessary traffic, at least in my opinion, trough my own line and the whole Tor network.

@_subject: The best way to run a hidden service: one or two computers? 
Well--I'm still convinced that running two physical computers is the best way to run a critical hidden service (instead of one computer optionally with a VM).
Like this: Linux Web Server -> Linux Tor Gateway -> DSL Router ->
No wireless equipment, just LAN cables between them.
The so far arguments against this setup, for rather using a VM on one single computer, are these (might be more, and I'm willing to learn!):
 An attacker with root access gained can read off hardware serial numbers on the Linux Web Server, like using tools as dmidecode. With that knowledge, those serial numbers can be linked to a certain purchase of those components, like having used a VISA card on a web shop. That also goes for the MAC address of the NIC.
 Direct attack on the NIC on the Linux Tor Gateway box. As Robert So here are my arguments against those:
 I've been able to find a brand new motherboard that doesn't leak any serial numbers of any components attached to it. I had to buy a few to find that one, but they do exist and it was worth it! When I run tools like dmidecode on that motherboard, the serial number lines for all the components are either blank, has just 'OEM' written or '123456789'. No serial numbers are shown. Neither any MAC addresses when running dmidecode. Though MAC-s are easilly read off by running 'ifconfig', even as an unprivileged user.
But it does show the model of the motherboard, and the models of some of its components, so having a brand new one might narrow down the buyers some. But still it would be hard to find ONE buyer world wide without one single serial number.
By using some older components from here and there--the secondhand marked is drowning in decent computer parts for give-away-prices--that additionally doesn't leak serial numbers during DMI decoding, should be very very very safe IMO.
The MAC address can be temporary spoofed, and it's very easy to do on a Linux system. Just one simple command in the Terminal, and 'sudo ifconfig -a' shows your spoofed MAC until you reboot, not the real one. You'll just have to remember to change it after a reboot!
 Regarding attacks on LAN devices, you can just buy a really simple one, without any firmware upgrade features at all, just a cheap and simple LAN card with a ROM chip, that just works. Nothing spicy or fancy.
The simpler, the better, right? :)
And I think it will generally be harder to crack hardware than cracking software, if we look at VMs in compare.
My point is that a VM is a software guest computer inside a host OS. Firewalling the VM with apparmor or selinux might help a lot. But braking out if a hard box seems way more difficult, and cracking a hardware LAN interface just by sending packets to it. And the server box will be totally isolated from the Internet anyway--it will only listen on the webserver ports, and only allow outgoing traffic that matching the incoming webserver requests.
But all this is only relevant if the attacker gains root access on the server. So I guess running a hardened simple Linux OS on the server, without a GUI, like OpenBSD or something, would make it extremely hard to contact and gain root on the gateway box--while I think it's a lot easier gaining root on a host machine that runs a guest OS inside a VM, because they're both on the same box.
I'm just thinking loudly here, I'm not pretending to be a wise guy nor a specialist. I appreciate to be proven wrong and learn something new! :)

Every now and then, when you start Tor, it searchers for relays/descriptors. And I've heard that it does that every now and then while it tuns as well.
Does it get this list from a few static IP addresses that never change, or does it pick randomly from thousands of IP addresses/dir lists out there?

@_subject: Is it possible to firewall Tor traffic with a hardware firewall? 
To make side channel attacks more difficult, especially for those who don't use virtual machines to run their hidden services, I was thinking about using a hardware firewall between the Tor computer and the Internet modem.
The hardware firewall can do IP based blocking, meaning that you can decide what IP address the Tor computer can connect to only. Like adding custom entry nodes in the Tor's config file and then put those IP addresses in the hardware firewall's rules so you can only connect to those, and no other IP.
But there's a problem doing this. Sometimes Tor needs to connect to a directory server (if I've understood it right?) to update its directory list.
And it doesn't connect to your exclusive entry node list for that. It seems, from the firewall's internal log, that it tries a lot of random IP's for that. So eventually your Tor engine will stop working or you can't restart it as long as the firewall blocks all outgoing traffic except for your entry node's IP addresses.
Is there a way to make this possible, so you can IP filter your Tor computer and lock its connections only to your entry nodes and directory servers?
Or is this impossible?

@_subject: The best way to run a hidden service: one or two computers? 
When running a hidden service, obviously hidden so no one can find the true source and IP of the web server because lives may be depended on that, I've heard that the best and safest way is to use a dedicated server computer with two operating systems and the server being inside a virtual machine. So if the web server should get cracked, the cracker will be locked inside the virtual machine and cannot do side-channel attacks or any other clever methods to reveal the true source.
Then I read somewhere that theres even a more secure way, and that is by using two dedicated computers. One computer with the web server running,
being connected with a LAN cable to the second computer which works as a firewalled router with Tor running on it with the hidden service keys. Again, if a cracker cracks the server machine, he will be physically trapped inside the server and cannot access the second computer nor the internet directly.
What are your opinions on this?
What should be done and what should be avoided while setting up such Thank you in advance for help!

Do you say that Ethernet cards may have backdoors built in, or did I misunderstand that?
What if you put a hardware firewall router between the first computer and the second:
[Server box with web server] -> [Hardware firewall router] -> [Gateway box with Tor] -> Internet/Tor entry node
And computer 1 and computer 2 operate on two different IP ranges, while the firewall router sets all the firewall directives between them.
Could this be safer?

How do external attackers get root access on a Linux system, and how do they then communicate with the system as root, like listing directories and changing configuration files as you would have done in a shell, when they're basically limited to a hidden website with the browsers address bar and maybe a few input forms? It gets more sensible when we're talking about default and open websites with the server's true IP addresses and ports out in the public, and exploitation of SSH servers. I'm just curious about that.

I've noticed that on most Linux distributions, Apache 2 (just an example) runs as a non-privileged user on the system. Though one Apache 2 process does run as Root, but it spawns unprivileged process children. So if it was to be a flaw in Apache 2, or PHP, that an attacker knew about, would he then be able to gain Root access if the software runs as a non-Root user?

I think you can use tor for anything, unless you're using a tor exit that's banned.
The problem is usually that such services require Java to work, and Java is mostly disabled or recommend to be disabled on tor setups because it can reveal your true IP by going side by tor. But if you know how to firewall your tor setup, you should be able to safely use Java. I don't know if you know how to do that, I think such firewalling is safer and works best on Linux anyway.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Request for Help Configuring Torbutton for Remote 
Your server must have two LAN devices, or at least one LAN device for your client and one WLAN device for the Internet.
If your LAN IP addresses are like this (just an example):
Server (Internet LAN/WLAN): 192.168.1.1 / Gateway: (IP of Internet router)
Server (LAN): 172.16.1.1 / Gateway: 172.16.1.2
Client: 172.16.1.2 / Gateway 172.16.1.1
Network mask can be 255.255.255.0 on all if you like.
Now your server can access Internet and it is setup to communicate with the client and vice versa by using these default gateways.
Your Tor setup file on your server must tell tor to listen on 172.16.1.1:9050. Polipo must listen on 172.16.1.1:8118, or whatever ports you choose above 1024, and Polipo must redirect traffic to tor's listen Now Tor and Polipo will access Internet and they will listen on the servers local LAN device instead of its localhost device. So the LAN device must be up and running before Tor and Polipo starts!
Then you must configure your client and its torbutton manually. That's easy, just add 172.16.1.1:8118 for HTTP connections and 172.16.1.1:9050 for SOCKS connections.
Now your client will send all Tor traffic to the servers LAN device, where Tor and Polipo listens to and redirects to your Internet router.
It may be tricky to tell your server OS which device to use for Internet and which for your local LAN, it depends what OS you're on. Maybe not if you're using WLAN for Internet. You'll also need to configure your server's firewall to allow incoming traffic from your client. Just try this and see how far you get.
(Anyone correct me if I'm wrong!)
Good luck! :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Suggestion: make _hidden services_ choose random entry 
All standard clients have the same entry nodes on a permanent basis or as long as the entry nodes are up, while the middle and exit nodes changes all the time. This is to reduce the chance of choosing an accidental path that is end-to-end supervised when browsing the WWW.
With hidden services, this isn't needed, since these are end-to-end encrypted connections. The same goes for those who visit hidden services. And randomness is what hidden services need to stay safe.
Because it's generally easy to distinguish clients from servers from the way data is transferred, and check if an IP is in the official Tor nodes list or not, it should be pretty easy to find hidden service clients by using a cluster of bad entry nodes to supervise IP addresses and traffic. With a large enough cluster, like 100-200 bad entry nodes, all new hidden services will have a 5-10% x3 chance to select a permanent bad entry node. Old hidden services may already have chosen a bad one, or will have the same 5-10% chance for each new entry node they select if their regular nodes go down. It's just a matter of analyzing timings and traffic, and the hidden service's IP could be found. This only regards listed hidden services, but I guess most are.
Since hidden services don't need to stick to the same entry nodes, the Tor developers should really consider making the Tor client randomly choose entry nodes, just as with middle and exits, for hidden service usage. It should be easy to add and it will increase the security of hidden services greatly by adding lots of randomness.

No, I didn't mean that the HS should choose random nodes. I meant that a HS should use _guards_ only, but switch between all available _guards_ randomly and often, so you don't stick to a (bad) guard long enough for the operator to make any traffic analysis.
If your HS connects to a (bad) guard, but stays there for only 5-10 min before jumping to another random guard, the guard operators will have very little to no time to investigate the clients and then do traffic To me this is simple math and logics, and if this is less secure than choosing 3 static guards for HS usage, please explain why.

Google is notorious at banning Tor exit nodes from using its search services. Either you're prompted with a phrase of words to enter into a form, requiring you to have cookies enabled, or you can't search at all.
Yahoo is partially blocking Tor exits, and is becoming more like Google by each day.
Microsoft's Bing is the exception! It's the last large search provider that hasn't yet banned any Tor exits nor complicated your search in any way.
Thank you Microsoft for not banning Tor exits!!

Today I discovered that wiki.debian.org blocks Tor exit nodes. There are many other sites doing the same thing, and this is an increasing trend among website admins.
If this trend continues, Tor will sooner or later become close to useless for regular clearnet surfing. And we'll be left with hidden services only.
Any ideas how to fix this problem?
Secret/unlisted exit nodes??

@_subject: [tor-talk] The heartbleed bug, 
It says in the blog:
"Hidden services: Tor hidden services might leak their long-term hidden service identity keys to their guard relays.
Like the last big OpenSSL bug, this shouldn't allow an attacker to identify the location of the hidden service,
but an attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service.
Best practice would be to move to a new hidden-service address at your convenience."
*If* the entry guard has obtained your private_key, or is capable of doing so, it *must* be capable of linking that private_key with the hidden service's real IP also. It is afterall your *entry* guard!
I think this bug is more severe than most people think or want to believe!

Since Tor uses only 3 entry nodes as default, it's often the entry nodes that are DDOSed, not the server.
Will increasing the amount of entry nodes for the hidden service make it available to more users during DDOS attacks, if you've got a very powerful server?
But more entry nodes equals less security right??

When I disable the hidden service and use Tor normally, it doesn't show up anymore.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Not comfortable with the new single-hop system merged 
I just think that this new single-hop system should have been reserved for a different Tor source/installation, dedicated only to non-anonymous hidden services, not merge it with the regular Tor software. And this for security.
I once witnessed a software (non-Tor related) that had a special function which was disabled by default, but was accidentally enabled due to a bug that occured during special circumstances, causing big trouble for some. In this case it caused a big money loss for some, but with the Tor software we are talking about the lives and wellbeing of humans.
How do I know that my hidden service is really running anonymously, and not with just 1-hop, besides just trusting the config defaults?
Please prove me wrong. I'm just concerned here, and just want some feedback.
Thanks for understanding!

@_subject: [tor-talk] How hard would it be to copy an onion address? 
There's a program out there that utilizes the GPU in your system to create a custom, kind of, onion address. At least the few first characters at the beginning of the address. So you can create an onion address like googleja6vbnyma6.onion. I've seen people being able to create a 7 character long custom name at the beginning of their addresses.
I guess this program creates loads of onion addresses, with the help of the GPU, and stops when it accidentally gets the "name" that you want.
Is that correct?
Anyway. The GPU's are just getting stronger these days! And people can have quad-SLI too, with 4 hardcore GPU's working in unison. Like 4 x TitanX.
So how hard would it be, more like how LONG would it take, to duplicate an onion address with the video cards that are available to the consumers today?
Not to mention Intel (and soon to be AMD) server CPU's with tons of cores in them.
Question 2: Will the next generation hidden services get longer onion names?

I believe that Google simply wants to supress our freedom and anonymity, because they are evil, and operated by evil beings.
You can't use Google Translate at all with most Tor exit nodes, while there are no sane reaons why they would block Tor users from just translating text.
To my surprise, Microsoft Bing doesn't block any Tor nodes at all! But they do require Javascript to search.
I personally use Duckduckgo for most searches. But they don't provide good search matches. But they have become much better, thankfully!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Questions on the coming next-gen onion services 
Will the next gen hidden services be more at risk of deanonymization during this transition period?
-------- Original Message --------
Apparently from: tor-talk-bounces at lists.torproject.org
Good question. Onion services need basically three different type of relays,
HSDir (directory), Intro point (IP) and Rendezvous Point (RP).
The tor 0.3.0 release has the next-gen support for HSDir and IP. For the RP,
the all current relays will work with next-gen. And for IP, next-gen services
have a legacy option to use old IPs (<= 0.2.9). It has been put there for this
transition period where we expect to have unfortunately a lot more tor out
there that don't support next-gen.
What is left is the HSDir that will have to be selected based on the protocol
version advertised by the relay. So at first, there might be very few of those
so there will be a period of time before we reached what we call "network
maturity" which will allow us to switch from the current service protocol to
the next-gen for all newly created services.

has become increasingly better lately. Only during the past 6 months or so, their search results have become almost on par with the big ones, like Google, Bing, etc.
In regards to Google, it all comes down to censorship and anti-privacy. Just like Microsoft and Windows 10 which now has a publicly known back-door, which you agree to in the ToS, enabling them to search through your whole computer at any given time and place. God bless Linux!
These are the two biggest companies, within online searching and OS, practicing pro censorship and anti-privacy. And it all make sense from a governmental/police point of view.
Simply avoid them!

@_subject: [tor-talk] V3 censorship ? 
I run both a V2 and V3 service on my Linux server. I'm using the same Tor
process with both. The torrc file is fairly standard, except I'm forcing some custom entry nodes, and I compile Tor from source on Debian Stretch.
The V2 service has worked flawlessly, more or less, for the last 5 years or so. It has about 98% uptime 365 days a year, according to my server stats. The server and Internet connection has always been fast and reliable.
When I add a V3 address to my server, it works pretty much flawlessly as well, but *only* until I make the address public. Non-public V3 addresses have about 98-99% uptime per week/month. But after the address has been made public, and people have learned about it, its uptime is suddenly reduced to about 60%. It will be completely inaccessible for hours at a time. *While* on the same Tor process, the V2 address works without issues.
By inaccessible I mean the same as having turned the service off.
Later I create a new V3 address, which is non-public. Only I know about it. It has about 98% uptime and works fine. I leave it there for a while, and it still works fine. I then make it public on my website, and the next day it is inaccessible when trying it. Uptime drops from 98% to 60-70%, and from there on it becomes randomly inaccessible, 4-8 hours time.
I tried for a third time, then fourth, and finally a fifth time, and the same pattern repeat itself, even with different and random timings.
On the forth attempt I released the V3 address in public at the same moment it was created, and it never achieved anything above 60% uptime per week from the very beginning.
I know the V3 system is new, and could have some undiscovered bugs, but my gut feeling tells me that someone, or something, is capable of censoring all my V3 addresses, while the old V2's are completely unaffected.
I am BTW running a sixth V3 address that has never been published, which I opened when the V3 system was in the Alpha release of Tor, and it has been running smoothly ever since!
Maybe I'm being paranoid, I just wanted to put this in the devs mail list, so at least they know about my problems. Maybe it's my setup, maybe it's my incompetence, maybe it's something important that needs to be looked into.
Oh BTW, I've tried several different entry nodes too, running several different Tor versions. I tried to clear the /var/lib/tor/ folder, tried on a different computer running a different Linux version. Also tried a different ISP. Think I've tried about everything, I like to believe I have some competence.

I'm not sure how to report bugs, so I'm doing it here.
This is how I can reproduce the bug on my system:
1. Onion services v2 and v3 works fine.
2. Stop tor process, and delete all files in /var/lib/tor (data dir)
   Or just remove 'state'
3. Start Tor, and you may experience v3 services not working for a    longer period of time, but v2 services come right back up with no problems.

But the first time I started tor with this add-on enabled, it connected to no
less than 21 entry nodes! Most of these connections died out after a certain
amount of time. But still, is this normal behavior?
Question 2:
If you limit the the `circ_max_megabytes` option in the Bandguards module,
will that work as some kind of DoS protection?

When, approximately, will we see the Vanguards add-on in the Tor source?

I’ve got a technical question: How dangerous are malicious entry guards?
I’ve seen very little info on this subject. Some state that there’s no immediate danger, while others state that you’ll “die on arrival”, especially if you’re operating a high risk onion service that falls into the Snowden/NSA territory, or an anti-government service in China/North Korea.
I’ve read undocumented claims about information/security agencies now using AI on super computers to aid with traffic analysis/correlation/confirmation attacks at entry node level, which is plausible considering the budgets at which certain agencies operate. I suspect a lot of entry guards, and nodes in general, are actually under their control.
Does anyone have any technical opinions, explanations or resources regarding this subject?
