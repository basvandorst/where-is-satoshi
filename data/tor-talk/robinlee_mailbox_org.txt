@_subject: [tor-talk] Moving stuff between Tor Browsers 
Hi list
I'm wondering what is the proper way to move all the
settings/bookmarks/saved passwords from one instance of Tor Browser to
an other? It doesn't matter if information gets overwritten on the
receiving end. Same version 8.0.4 and same OS (Linux) on both.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor browser and remembering settings 
There was a regression some time ago in Tor browser that it would no longer remember that java scripts had been allowed for specific sites. Now every time you start Tor browser it has forgotten all your previous settings. I thought it was just some temporary regression but now it has been a while and it has started to bug me so I thought I would ask if it is going to fixed at some point?

Thanks, although after some searching I found this ticket that was
probably the one you were thinking about. And it workaround worked.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How secure is a hidden service? 
I'm wondering how hidden a hidden service actually is? Because last
week charges were brought against Flugsvamp, a Swedish darknet drug
shop. In the documents made public for the court case the police states
that is was able to trace the actual ip-addresses of the onion-
addresses. Flugsvamp had two onion-addresses and the the police gave
different probabilities that a certain ip-address was behind each.
Is it just a function of time and amount of traffic, i.e. the longer
you are online and the more traffic you generate, the more probable it
is to discover the true ip-address?

These documents are available at Page 103 in the file 'Stockholms TR B 13010-18 Aktbil 202.pdf' contains
a short PM about the tracing. It is a vast set of documents, but as far I've been able to tell
identifying the VPS-servers behind the onion-addresses was the first

Is there any known difference between v2 and v3 in how easy it is to
find the ip-address behind the onion-address?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor browser 9.0.7 is broken 
I just updated to Tor browser 9.0.7 and now any site that I've given
javascript permission to no longer works! For example I go to  and the website says I should enable
javascript, but I already added this site to the ones that can send
javascript and Tor browser tells me that it has blocked 0 items.
How can I downgrade to resolve this quickly?
