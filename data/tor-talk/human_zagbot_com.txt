@_subject: [tor-talk] virtual private servers for Tor? 
In the past I have run a tor relay that was pushing about 60Mb/sec 24x7. It
was running in an OpenVZ container and it had no problems. It was running in
a container on my own dedicated server and not a VPS from a hosting company.
In summary if I may clarify for anyone finding this thread by a search -
OpenVZ, and I guess other container technologies, will run tor relays just
fine BUT restrictions placed on the VPS by a hosting company may cause
