In my opinion,
After installing TBB (Tor Browser Bundle), users should disable JS
(JavaScript) by default, and enable JS, ONLY when visiting a website
and if the user must have to, to view a very specific portion.
TBB by default keeps "Script Globally Allowed" option ENABLED or
selected, inside "NoScript" extension/plugin. It should be set to
Disabled or keep unselected.  If your "NoScript" plugin/extension
shows the option "Forbid Scripts Globally", (inside "General" tab
window), then select/enable it.
It is more important that Privacy remains intact, then a website
appearing nice on 1st visit.
User can enable JS for certain set of URL for a website, if they
NEED to, by themselves.
They just need to enable few domains with certain sub-domains of
from the "NoScript" icon or warning-button.
If a website (for example: TorProject.org) is trustworthy then users
can choose "Allow TorProject.org" in "NoScrpt" plugin/extension
("Crossed-out-alphabet-S") icon, instead of "Temporarily allow
TorProject.org" option. Then allowed site will not cause "NoScript"
to bug/ask user with prompt-message for permission.
(I requested to keep Global JS disabled by default, many times, but
many ignored, we had long conversation in IRC chans, multiple times).
The main purpose of using "NoScript" is, that, on 1st visit to a
known or unknown website, that website's JS codes not suppose to
load/start automatically, unless user (website's visitor) inspects
website first, and then allows JS for sub-domains/domains manually.
Those who want to keep JS globally enabled, they should do it by
selves and understand+take the risk, (which is not right thing to do
at-all), but that is again, just my own opinion and request.
Do not infect your web-browser or loose Anonymity on your 1st visit
to a website. (So, Keep JS off, cross-site script off/disabled, etc).
Regular user has no way to know, when a website is/was hacked or
when "some" mistake was made, and then, some unwanted
(harmful/malware) codes are coming to you and getting executed on
your computer.
There is "WOT" plugin, for non Tor internet websites. A similar new
plugin is needed, which will accept recommendation only from users
who are using "Tor" exit-nodes or onion host. So that such new
Tor-WOT plugin can show which site is trusted or not, by other Tor
proxy users. May be new one can even import some portion of data
from regular WOT, if that data is GPL/shareable.

Response is below, in-between.
Received from scarp, on 2013-08-07 4:44 AM:
... than a website ...
A new firefox extension Tor-WOT (Web Of Trust) can be useful, as
already mentioned by me in my previous email. WOT shows icon. After
visiting a site, users can just look at the WOT-icon status, and
can/may decide/choose if he/she wants to allow JS or not.
I would suggest such way : Tor-Browser need to download the
"UPDATEable" Tor-Browser like this : 1st get ONLY the SHA-256 or
SHA-512 hash/checksum of the "Updateable" Tor-Browser (a small file)
file from (TorProject.org's) onion host via Tor proxy.  Then
TorBrowser should get the actual full "Updateable" file from any one
of the set of download mirror onion sites. Check downloaded file
with the previously received HASH code. When checking succeeded,
then update it. But pls make sure update-process asks user, in what
way he/she wants to update ? in (1) an "overwrite and loose all
previous settings" way, or (2) keep existing extension settings
(like, TabMix Plus, SessionManager, Torbutton, NoScript, etc) and
update older one with new Tor-Browser.
(I have updated older TorBrowser (Firefox portion only) with newer
ones, first few times i wasn't able to update without loosing my old
extension's settings, luckily i made backup of original folder
before experimenting, so at the end i was able to figure out which
folders and files need to be updated so that older extensions do not
loose data (or settings data were exported in external file), and
then after update, settings were imported back which were exported).
Best would have been something similar to what PortableApps Firefox
does, it can completely keep previous settings.  User who needs
fresh installations, they can install TBB or update in a new folder.
These (TAILS, etc) requires more extra tools or device and/or
more/other necessary steps or components. If simple Tor users cannot
choose or do simple mouse-click on "Allow" or "Temporarily allow" JS
options in "NoScipt" icon, for the site he/she is visiting, (and may
need to temporarily-allow few more extra/related content sites, used
by primary website that he/she is visiting), then such users will
make even more mistakes in using those, and will be more hard for
them. But no doubt those are best (recommended) ways.
The "NoScript" is like your pet-dog, you will have to train it, once
you adjust or train (that is, you select JS options properly) then
it will not bother you anymore, and keep obeying/following you/your
instructions, the way you want it.
First dis-allow execution of global JS option in NoScript.
TLD = Top Level Domain. For example, the ".org" portion in
SLD = Second Level Domain. For example, the "TorProject" portion in
3LD/sub = 3rd level domain. For example, the "trac" portion in
The "trac" portion can also be called a sub-domain. Sub-domain of
The website which Tor user is visiting, if user trusts it (you may
see WOT icon's recommendation), then select "Allow" (SLD portion) in
"NoScript" icon.  And the websites which you/user do not need to
work normally on all visitation, you/user can manually select them
each time by using "Temporarily allow" option.  And the websites you
do not trust at all or which shows AD(vertisements, etc or has the
word "AD") or other unnecessary things, do not click any one of
those sites, but advertisers wont be happy that their JS is not
running.  Because that is what we want, we want them to use simple
non-fishy HTML codes and images.
Primary website often use another secondary website (or sub-domain
site) as their content or media-file delivery website, that
secondary needs to be JS enabled sometime, for the primary website
to work better.  This/such duo/trio combination is very well known
for well known websites, once you start using the way many other
"NoScript" users, then it will come very easy to you, which to
allow, and which to not.  For example, for some JS scripts to work
properly on "wikipedia.org", it may need "wikimedia.org" website JS
also.  For images/pictures to work properly "Yahoo.com" will needs
"ytimg.com",  Yahoo.com sometime needs "yahooapis.com" if you need
to view portion of yahoo website which involves JS codes, so
be-extra careful when enabling/allowing "yahooapis.com".
If you/user enable JS globally then all unnecessary websites,
advertisement, and "fishy" cross-site websites, etc all JS codes
gets executed on 1st visit, (and they saves cookies on 1st
visitation/connection as well), very dangerous.
Change cookie related settings, so that, only the site you are
visiting only that website's cookie is accepted, when YOU want to
and choose to do so.  Also use "AdBlock Plus" plugin/extension for
bit higher level safety.
So bottom line is : use restrictively, for your own safety.
NoScript has many many options. One of them is to allow certain
internal codes or config page of firefox to be allowed if
pre-programmed. Those can be used for executing certain firefox and
anonymity related codes, but all other should be kept blocked normally.
Many are using it for protecting their Privacy+Anonymity.  And that
is suppose to be the purpose of TorProject.
And it is also true many are using it for mixed usage.
May be there should be TWO TBB, so that these TWO groups of users
can choose which to use, and be happy about it, and cannot blame you
in future anymore.  One TBB should be optimized to protect and place
priority on protecting user's Privacy+Anonymity.  Another can be
optimized the way now the current TBB is, optimized for convenience,
as it by default allows all JS !

Hi, Current TBB, when installed (in WinXP), will use port 9150 (to
be more correct: 127.0.0.1:9150) as the Tor-proxy IP-address:port,
it is a Socks5 proxy port, so other apps which you need to route/go
thru Tor-network will need to be (network-settings-)configured, to
use that socks5 port, the port 9150, and most likely they will need
ip-address, that will be your computer's local ip address : 127.0.0.1
And in between IP-adrs & port, the ":" symbol is usually used in
most software (but not always), or apps may have different textbox
for IP-adrs and port. And in your other apps, if it have option to
choose type of proxy, then select Socks5 proxy option.
The apps which you do not want to route/go thru Tor-network, leave
them as is.
Vidalia.exe connects with Tor.exe on Tor.exe's port 9153 to control
Tor related activities.
Older TBB software used Socks5 port 9050, and control port 9051.

For example,
if you decompress tor-browser-versn or zip file using
decompressing software like, 7-zip, in a folder named "TBB_versn
(inside C:\PortableApps\ folder) then inside that "TBB_versn
folder you should see, one sub-folder, named:
Tor Browser
Then if you go inside that "Tor Browser" folder, you will see these
below sub-folders:
- - - - - -
Create a new folder-structure like this:
C:\PortableApps\TBB_02\Tor Browser\
- - - - - -
Then copy that "FirefoxPortable" from
C:\PortableApps\TBB_versn Browser\ folder, into above new
- - - - - -
Obtain last stable release of "Firefox Portable" from the
portableapps.com site, and install inside "C:\PortableApps\" folder.
Copy the "FirefoxPortable.exe" file from
"C:\PortableApps\FirefoxPortable\" into below folder location:
C:\PortableApps\TBB_02\Tor Browser\FirefoxPortable\
Create a shortcut-link of below .exe file on your windows Desktop:
C:\PortableApps\TBB_02\Tor Browser\FirefoxPortable\FirefoxPortable.exe
Rename the shortcut in your desktop, into "Firefox_TBB_02", or
"Firefox TBB 02", so its easier to understand what it is.
- - - - - -
Open the below file for editing:
C:\PortableApps\TBB_02\Tor Browser\FirefoxPortable\FirefoxPortable.ini
find and change the below line, from:
into this:
- - - - - -
So then, if you run the shortcut-link on your Desktop, then you can
START the FIREFOX, that you copied from last TBB.
- - - - - -
Another optional way (means, you do not have to do these steps,
unless you want to test this process out) to start the Firefox from
TBB_02 is to do these:
Create a TXT file inside below folder location:
C:\PortableApps\TBB_02\Tor Browser\
then rename it to : Start_TBB_Firefox.cmd
then open Start_TBB_Firefox.cmd it for edit, and add below one
"C:\PortableApps\TBB_02\Tor Browser\FirefoxPortable\Data\profile"
so then, that batch script file "Start_TBB_Firefox.cmd" can also be
used to start TBB firefox.
- - - - - -
After you start Firefox any of the above way, you will have to make
sure, the network-settings are properly set or not. If you are using
default TBB, (and current default TBB uses port 9150 as socks5
port), so that is/port what should be shown inside Network Settings,
and inside Torbutton, if not, use custom settings and force it to
use 127.0.0.1:9150 and socks5 proxy.
And if you have firewall/security software, then make sure
tbb-firefox.exe which is inside TBB_02 folder, can only connect
outbound with port 9150, (and also allow tbb-firefox.exe to connect
with any local port of local loopback address (127.0.0.1) only).
tbb-firefox should not be allowed to connect with any internet
server or with any dns-server, (neither locally or which is in
- - - - - -
Using TBB-Firefox copied out of last+latest TBB bundle is better,
than using "Portable Firefox" or full "Firefox", as it is already
pre-configured with many anonymity related tweaks.  But make sure
TBB-firefox's various internal and extension settings are really set
onto protect your Anonymity and Privacy, first, ... rather than
comfortableness or ease-of-use.  Anonymity and Privacy is more
important than any other advantages.  or else go use something else.

He assumed & thinks, i'm starting "Firefox Portable".
Just because i suggested to get "Firefox Poratble" does not mean,
i'm suggesting to use it, or used it.
I advised not to use "Portable Firefox" via Tor. And suggested to
use TorBrowser (which is based on firefox).
What is suggested, will result into, starting a TorBrowser from
inside TBB_02 folder, not the "Firefox Portable" downloaded from

Hash: SHA512
Oracle Virtualbox (GPL, free) and VMware Fusion (Proprietary,
not-Free), VMware Player (Proprietary, free), etc all works on
MacOSX (or OSX86).  Oracle VirtualBox and VMware WorkStation and
VMware Player, etc all works on Linux, Windows, etc Host OS.  In
VMware Player a new VM cannot be created, copied VM can be used, and
then can be modified.  In VMware WorkStation, VM can be created &
modified.  WorkStation (it comes with the free Player) can be
downloaded as Trial usage mode.
These hypervisor software will allow to create VM (Virtual Machines)
for Guest OS, running on top of the Host OS/machine. Everything
inside a VM is virtual/emulated/simulated.
(Almost) ANY bootable or Live-Bootable DVD/CD ISO files, Physical
DVD/CD-ROM drives, Bootable or Non-Bootable Physical USB flash
drives/sticks, etc all can be directly attached with a VM, and then
run inside a VM.
Inside a VM, virtual empty drive or virtual formatted drive, etc can
be attached & created.  VM and Virtual drive's can be encrypted too.
 Such virtual empty-drive or formatted-drive will actually exist as
a physical file in Host OS.  On older FAT32 based host OS, file
will/may span over multiple files distributed on 1024 MBytes files.
 On NTFS, HPFS, LVM, ext2/3, etc file will remain as 1 large file.
You can create VM with a virtual drive, or without a virtual drive,
upto you.  Inside a VM, a physical drive partition can also be used
as a virtual-drive.  And compacting features can be used to reduce
physical file-size, related to any VM.
Oracle VirtualBox and VMware WorkStation/Fusion/Player etc all have
extension-packs, which contains latest virtual drivers.  Some are
generic, GPL.  Some are proprietory.
If the Guest-OS disk/disc/drive/stick, pre-includes those
virtual-drivers, then such Guest-OS can run even better inside the VM.
Before installing VirtualBox or VMware, etc hypervisor software, do
this : Go inside your physical HOST computer's UEFI/EFI/BIOS
(usually by pressing F2, F10, F8, F1, Command, etc keboard buttons),
and enable feature such as : Virtualization, AMD-V, Intel VT-x, etc
... whichever you will see inside your BIOS/firmware.  Physical
computers which will have those Hardware(HW) based virtualization
support, then VM will run smoothly & faster in those computers,
videos will play better, OR ELSE, those hypervisor software will
create partial virtualization or para-virtualization
environment/container based VM ... which will be slow and less
smooth ... but will at-least run.
TAILS should release a VirtualBox VM based edition.
And disable/disconnect usb web-cam inside a VM, and better is to
cover the web-cam with a white-or-black small piece of paper.  Some
computers model already comes with a physical shutter to cover the
web-cam glass-hole.
PCI-passthrough features in hypervisor software can be used to
connect extra/2nd PCI / PCIe based keyboard interface or other
physical hardware devices DIRECTLY with the Guest-OS VM, to use a
completely separate keyboard or other device, than host's keyboard.
And there are GRUB, etc boot-manipulation software based tiny
bootable iso which can also be used with hypervisor/VM, to boot from
a Physical Bootable USB sticks, inside VM, directly.  Bootable USB
sticks can be imaged, and can be booted inside the VM as well.
Hope these info helps,

@_subject: [tor-talk] VOIP and tor 
Hash: SHA512
As far as i'm aware there are few voice & text language
physical-machine based translator, that can convert language, and
then speak it out with another speakers voice in another language.
That is what VoIP software over Tor needs to use and implement.
For live person to person discussion or talk:
Delay is of less importance (that is 2nd or later priority).
Anonymity is of more importance (that is, first priority).
User voice has biological marks/fingerprints.
A user's own voice should not be broadcasted/sent to other side.
Both/all side MUST do similar to this (when using Tor):
VoIP software -> voice -> convert voice2text -> text -> sent to
other side, over encrypted tunnel ->
text2voice(use_profile_male_John) -> voice.
Such VoIP client need to have practice+correction+train MODE.  So
users can SPEAK various things and REPLAY it, by choosing one out of
different common audio-profiles, like John, Jane, etc, to hear and
test what other side will hear.  Then use it for conversation.
And it will also be nice to have speech variation even for single
profile, like John.  Then more than one person can use such for
GROUP DISCUSSION purpose, instead of (two-party) TALK/DISCUSSION.
This idea came from practical use case description from another
user: that user has sent his/her TYPED-IN text in a Text2Speech free
software, that software SPEAKED/PLAYED those typed text out load,
and software was configured to use specific output audio channel,
that audio channel was used as input for VoIP software to travel
over Tor, for that communication, (initially VPN was used, but
later) SSH ethernet tunnel was used and worked.

Firewall log should show various outbound & inbound attempts that

are (trying to go or) going through it (LAN/WiFi interface).
And, also try "Wireshark".  Which can show, for example : if there
is any DNS leaks, when you use Enigmail GPG [en|de]cryption or
GPG-key retrieve, etc via Thunderbird (which is configured to go
through Tor proxy).
