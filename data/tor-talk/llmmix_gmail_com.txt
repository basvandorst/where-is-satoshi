It is checkout Sep 05, 2005
So it's Tor-0.1.1.6-alpha-cvs internally.
BTW, We had a blackout last night though it's short moment.
so my computer power down without power/reset switch.
and next time, my tor got segmentation fault, so i checkout the latest tor-cvs,
compiled and installed it, but same result.

I couldn't find the core, and i am not running tor-server, it just a client.
BTW,  and the next day, suddenly, everything just to be normal.
Total 2 mysterious things happened in tor-history, IIRC.
