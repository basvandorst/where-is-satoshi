I just completed a local DNS server for Tor using Tor_resolve to resolve host names
to ip addresses through Tor.... it is for windows only....

What I am going to do is correct the problem by coding TorDNS to listen on the actual
ip address of your internet connection rather than local host..... then i will update the website
thanks for the info

I updated the program EXE and website, windows 2000 users have to use their actual ip address
as a DNS server in win2k networking instead of localhost with TorDNS... The problem with this might be dynamic IP addressing with the DHCP server of their ISP and TorDNS.... Download the win2k version beow:

@_subject: New version of TorDNS 
I just fixed the cache in TorDNS and added "Keepaliveperiod 30" to Tor config file (torrc),
now TorDNS seems to be working ALOT better than before with Tor. I changed the time
TorDNS caches queries from 5 minutes to 40. I also created a small program to automatically
add TorDNS to the startup folder in windows, so when you start windows, TorDNS automatically
runs. It is included with the new version. After this fix, TorDNS seems to resolve hostnames
alot more effieciently, I've been testing it for about 10 minutes now, notices in Tor saying
"We tried to connect to 'scrubbed' for 15 seconds, retrying on a new circuit" have not been
displayed in Tor, meaning TorDNS acts alot more like a normal local dns server now. The download url is below:

Hey Matt, is this a windows bundle? Was wondering if you were interested in adding TorDNS to your installer. (TorDNS is for windows only)

There is two version os TorDNS, one that listens on locahost 127.0.0.1 (WinXP) and
one that listens on isp IP (win2000)..... im going to code that option in there later on.... taking
a break :)

@_subject: TorDNS windows cache problem fix 
I found a problem with TorDNS and windows. You have to turn off the windows dns cache in order for TorDNS to function properly. This will also cause "ipconfig /flushdns" in command prompt not to work, and the reason why is because once you turn off the windows dns cache, there is no cache to flush. The instructions on how to turn off windows dns cache is on the TorDNS website.

@_subject: New TorDNS version, works fantastic 
I just finished fixing the problem of console boxes loading when TorDNS is resolving hostnames
to ip addresses. It now directly accesses Tor the same way as Tor_resolve. Very fast and
more efficient. No more tor_resolve, no more black console boxes.
v1.3 download below

Sorry for all the threads, anyways......
I had to fix something in TorDNS, it was not waiting long enough to resolve hostnames, it should
be fixed now..... TorDNS v1.3b
p.s. This program is the bomb, fast DNS resolvement through Tor, like an isp name server...

That is because you did not set it up properly..... you need to change your DNS network
settings to localhost....primary  DNS changed to localhost (usually 127.0.0.1) and seconday
DNS you leave blank, so windows does not attempt to connect to any other DNS server
but TorDNS.
Program works great for me :)

@_subject: TorDNS fixed 
Well, I added a win2k version of TorDNS to the website. The problem might be also
that you have a version of TorDNS already running in memory (somwhow), press
CTRL-ALT-DELETE and stop any process that has TorDNS in it..... Then try If not, the problem might be that you can not use 127.0.0.1 as a DNS server. If so,
use the win2k version.
Please let me know how it works.

TorDNS is actually pretty fast, because Tor caches DNS results, and so does TorDNS..
sometimes the resolving hangs, but that is not because of TorDNS, that is Tor itself having
problems resolving the hostnames..... Even when the results are not cached, it still is pretty fast
(but not quite as fast as a direct connection to some other DNS server)

@_subject: Concerning TorDNS problems 
TorDNS is still in early development, so if you have problems using it... This might be why.
1. You firewall is blocking TorDNS, or TorDNS using port 53
2. You have TorDNS already running memory, close it (or them) and try it 3. Windows will not let you use TorDNS on localhost, follow instructions on the website (win2k)
4. Windows networking is not properly configured for TorDNS (see website)
5. For some reason, it will not let TorDNS open a udp connection on port 53
6. Your version of windows just will not accept the program.
7. You must have Tor running at the same time, as TorDNS resolves hostnames through Tor only

@_subject: TorDNS - Another fix 
I just fixed a bug in TorDNS that was slowing down internet activity when trying to
resolve a hostname that does not exist. It is now fixed (I'm pretty sure). TorDNS is now
working much more stable now concerning this problem, which means faster browsing, etc.
Again, here is the link below (TorDNS v1.5)

Hi, I'm new here but anyhow... I have developed a program called Nodeblock to block Tor routers outside any
country or countries you  specify.... im looking for people to test it, i have an ftp setup so you can
access it and download the nodeblockv11.rar and the install text file..... make sure you read
the text file first before installation and set it up accordingly, or nodeblock will not work.
you need to be running the latest alpha version of Tor for WIN32 or it will not work.... any version after the current alpha version of Tor should work..... please let me know what you think....

Hi Nick, I was unaware of the violation of clause 3 of the GPL.
The rar is very big because of DLL files needed to run certain programs in nodeblock...
I will put the source code on the ftp....Done
well, the wget source code is bundled with the nodeblock program....

I tried nodeblock with the new alpha version of Tor and there was

rather then router hash keys...... You have to redownload the new RAR Everything has been updated to fix the problem, source, program... etc....

@_subject: Tor will complain about nicknames, ignore it 
They must changed the structure of the has key data that is sent to localhost control port when
doing a "GETINFO network-status" command, because once they released a new alpha version of Tor, nodeblock went nuts when compiling the hash key data.... for some reason, the creators of
Tor changed part of the code where you specify a nickname to exlude in the torrc. config file, it will
probably give you a [warm] message about, but in the Tor documentation, you can use nicknames
with the  option in the config file.... so im going to try to send email to the programmers that hopefully they can send the hashkey data as straight ascii text with carriage returns
......  So if Tor gives you those warnings, just ignore them....

@_subject: New beta version of TorDNS 
Attempting to rectify the problem with TorDNS not always resolving hostnames when using the internet, TorDNS is now coded to hammer Tor resolve over socks function, making TorDNS a little more cpu intensive at times, but should insure better hostname to ip resolvements. The problem with using TorDNS and Tor to resolve hostnames to ip addresses (When TorDNS sometimes does not resolve them right away) is seemingly Tor itself, and not TorDNS. I encountered the same problem when using Tor_resolve, Tor would lose connection  and retry on a new circuit, while using TorDNS or Tor_resolve. It is due to broken resolve over socks functions on the exit nodes (From what I was told). Also, TorDNS v1.7 listens on address
127.1.2.3 instead of localhost. I hope this has fixed the problem with windows users that do not
have a localhost interface (win2k i.e.). The webpage is below

I was watching my isp interfere with TorDNS. Was watching them do so four 3 or 4 weeks now.
When I would be using firefox to browse, once in a blue moon my isp name was found in the TorDNS log screen, and the website would not be resolved. The instructions for fixing this (I hope this will perminantly stop your isp from interfering with TorDNS on your windows box) can be found
on the TorDNS website under "READ THIS...".... Also, I have released TorDNS beta 4, hopefully I have fixed all the major bug issues. Website is below............
