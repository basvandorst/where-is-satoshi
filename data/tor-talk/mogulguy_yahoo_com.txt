Hmm, on this page:
in the docs it says:
  Using privoxy is necessary because   browsers leak your DNS requests when   they use a SOCKS proxy directly,   which is bad for your anonymity.   Privoxy also removes certain   dangerous headers from your web   requests, and blocks obnoxious ad   sites like Doubleclick.
Is that no longer true?  If it is still true, is there any way to get privoxy to use stunnel for its SSL connections so that the SSL connection is only from privoxy to the server?

I have what may perhaps seem like a strange question. Is there any commonly used software for encrypting and
decrypting web pages?  Let me explain that a little better:  imagine a web
site which has content destined for specific
individuals.  For each individual there is separate
content on separate pages, and no one but the
individual for whom the content is destined should be
able to read the content, not even the creator of the
In other words, is there a private/public key
mechanism similar to PGP (or even a PGP web page
plugin) that will work transparently while browsing
the web?  The transparently part would mean that a
user can provide a private key to a browser and any
pages encrypted with the user's public key would
automatically be decrypted for him when he views them.

Yes, that is the scenario I am trying to deal with.  When it comes to anonymity/secure communications I would assume all hosting services could be hostile.
Yes the fallback is a manual process, I was looking for an automated way, say by using SSL in some weird way where the SSL was preencrypted on the server and without a client key negotitation since the client already has the key to decrypt it?  But I can't figure that one out, plus it would seem to require a different web server (different key) for each user!
For portability?  Java is the least portable language I have ever programmed in! ;)
Despite my bias, an embedded java app would not work since it would be controlled (provided) by the hostile server right?

2) Senders are untrusted to recipients.
3) Web server is untrusted to recipients.
4) Senders create the encrypted web page
   content and post it to an untrusted    web server destined for specific    individual recipients.
5) Once posted to the web server, senders    are expected, but not guranteed to
   (see  to delete all plain text    versions of the web pages.
6) The web server should never see plain    text versions of the web pages (see 7) One web page is destined for one single
   user, i.e. it is encrypted with one
   public key ony.  If the sender needs to
   send the same message to multiple    recipients, he will simply create    multiple web pages and no one even    needs to know this.
8) Any web server side access mechanim can
   only be used to manage web pages, not
   for data access (see   In other    words, there could be web server side    access mechanisms to control the    posting and deleting of web pages, but
   not the decrypting of web pages.

Yes, I was hoping for a simple HTMLified Seems like perhaps instead of implementing this at the browser level, this could be implemented at the proxy level.  Simply send requests to a personal local proxy which can intercept encrypted pages and decrypt the ones it has the private keys to!  This would be more versatile, usable by more browsers, less vulnerable to JS/other dynamic html attacks...
Anyone want to implement it? ;)  It could
use gpg.  Can anybody suggest a good simple well written proxy which would be easy to hack to add this to?

Yes, but I really am just talking about a more secure version of the one to many scenario where you don't trust the server!
The many, of course, can always be one.
Ignore the "one to one" aspect and I think that you may still be right.  But trusting the server still leads to a less secure method of 'one to many' and my suggested "HTML features" would be helpful there too!
Maybe not so uncommon, just that most
people readily accept that the server should "know all" or they give up.  I think that there are many opportunities which are lost because
some people will not outsource their
hosting because they will not accept that "the server should know all" and because
they do not have the resources to host
things themselves.  The simplest and most obvious one is encrypted webmail
using regular webmail sites.
A solution to this problem could open up many new doors, and many of those doors I suspect would be very welcomed/needed in tor land, not just for my application,

@_subject: Security concerns/help me understand tor 
I have a concern that running a tor may in some cases
provide a security breach allowing unexpected access
to the inside of certain networks that are behind
firewalls.  In particular, I am concerned with what I
assume is a fairly common design for home routers. This scenario may well illustrate how little I
understand about tor, if so, could someone please set
me straight. :)
My home router offers an http administration console
on port 80 which for obvious security reasons is
normally only accessible from the internal facing side
of the router.  While many of these home routers
typically have an internal private IP such as
192.168.1.1 and an external public IP, they sometimes
respond to both IPs from the inside and sometimes they
even allow access to the administration console on the
external IP if it is accessed from the internal side
of the router (mine does).  This would not normally be
a problem, but add a tor exit server to the inside of
a home network serviced by such a router and ...you
can probably guess where I am going with this.
Suppose that Bob hosts a tor exit server NATed behind
one of these routers and perhaps he even hosts a
public facing website NATed to this router since it is
behind his router/firewall.  If Alice decides to check
out Bob's website using tor she may suddenly be given
the opportunity to test her ethical disposition for
being an attacker by unexpectedly being presented with
the login screen to Bob's router admin console!
This, of course, should only happen if Alice's tor
client chooses Bob's tor server as the exit node. But, if I understand the tor documentation correctly,
this would in fact be the preferred way for tor
client's to access Bob's website since they should be
able to detect that Bob's website and his tor exit
server are in fact both (NATed to) the same public
If I am correct about this possibility, and without
arguing the virtues of whether these routers are doing
the right thing by providing access to the admin
console from the external IP from their inward facing
interface, I think that tor relay providers should be
strongly warned about this possibility in the tor
documentation!  I am not sure that there is a good
default (out of the box) way to prevent this from
happening with tor, but I suspect that if Bob sets an
exit policy explicitly rejecting his own IP that he
would be safe from this sort of compromise?
And to add a tiny bit of credibility to this theory: I
believe that I experienced accessing my own router
this way through tor last night after running my
server for about an hour. But, I could not reproduce
it today and I am unwilling to try this for very long
since I do not want to be so exposed.
All this leads to another question I have about tor
which will probably really show how ignorant I am. What prevents tor exit nodes from spoofing any IP that
they want and easily setting up phishing attacks?? Afterall, they are now potentially acting as routers
for anyone trusting enough to use tor, can't they
decide where to send their exit streams and spoof any
public IP?

@_subject: Security concerns/help me understand tor 
This seems like a nice valid option, spoofing
the external IP from within the tor exit node?
In other words if the web internal IP is say:
192.168.1.2, any request for the external
IP through the tor exit would actually yield
a request directly to the web server's internal
IP, 192.168.1.2, instead?
That sounds like a nice feature to be able to
get the best of both worlds: 1) security for
the relay operator and 2) for users accessing
the NATed web site!
Naturally this should be configurable for
specific ports only.  Of course, adding an
IP spoofing mechanism directly to tor exit
nodes makes it that much easier for IPs in
general to be spoofed by exit nodes! :(

@_author: Martin Fick 
@_subject: Security concerns/help me understand tor 
No, I think a you may have misunderstood the suggestion, I had to read it twice too.  :)
Perhaps I can try illustrating this better.
To start with we have website W hosted on internal
private IP P (192.168.1.2) forwarded to the world by a NATting router with internal IP GW (192.168.1.1)
at external IP E.  Anyone on the outside can (and are
supposed to be able to!) get to web site W by accessing E, not P, with or without tor.  1) Site (W)  [P]<--- NAT [E]<---- Internet (anyone)
But with or without tor no-one can actually get to
W from the intranet, I, on external IP E since the
router intercepts that IP, E, and presents its admin console A on E.
So, instead of seeing this:
2) Client     [I]--->[E]  Router       Site  (W) [P]<---     Router
intranet clients get:
3) Client     [I]--->[E]  Router Admin Console (A)
Now, add an internal tor exit relay on the inside of the firewall trying to legitimately get to W on E (similar to 1):
4)       Tor  <---    Router <---- Internet(anyone)
         Tor  --->[E] Router    Site (W) [P] <---    Router
Note: they are not trying to illegitimately access W at P, but at legitimate E!  Instead they end up more like (3):
5)       Tor <---     Router <---- Internet (anyone)
         Tor  --->[E] Router Admin console (A)
The suggested fix instead of simply barring
E in the exit policy (since it is a legitimate endpoint,) to spoof E with P internally to tor!
6) Tor <------------- Router <---- Internet (anyone)
   Tor --->[P] Site (W)
Yes, this is somewhat similar to a hidden service
because we are accessing a web site, W, on the
inside of the intranet, but that site is supposed
to be accessed from the outside we are simply
bypassing the obstructed trip to the internal router hoping to just be NATted and bounced back to P (4).  The original scenario (4) which is impossible because of (5) would have done the same thing as (6) just by a different route!
Does that make more sense and sound Do You Yahoo!?

While your analysis is correct (two potentially
unencrypted hops), the encryption concerns in
themselves should be irrelevant to the concerns of
Tor is not an encryption technology.  The only reason
for encrypting the other hops is for anonymity so that
each hop only knows about its immediate peers.  The
question is whether an unencrypted last leg affects
anonymity?  Plain text communication after tor should
already be considered compromised and if this leg were
unencrypted it should not be considered an additional
plain text compromise.

@_subject: getting more exit nodes 
Fair enough, good concerns, perhaps a good argument
for ensuring that client exit nodes are visible, but
this is not really affected by encryption.  But,
perhaps authentication is important here so that
client exit nodes can at least be accurately
identified, good and bad ones; tor users should
therefore have a say in which client exit nodes to
route to?  Perhaps a client exit tor node could be required to
connect to all other tor nodes?  This would be
resource intensive, but it would allow the client exit
node to act just like any other tor exit node since it
could then be chosen as an exit node from any middle
tor node (and thus encryption becomes important again
here) and no longer requiring a fourth hop?
This techniques could further be extended to middle
nodes to allow them to bypass firewall restrictions. The only restriction imposed by firewalls would now
become entrance nodes since they would need to accept
connections from anywhere!  Well, perhaps it wouldn't
work since any of these special nodes could not
communicate with any of these other special nodes. You could devise complicated routing algorithms to
enable this to work for middle nodes too, but it is
probably more complicated than it's worth.  I guess
sticking to exit nodes might makes this more workable.
Having routing restrictions like this might make it
easier to deduce paths within the cloud also.  If I
know that a certain node can only connect to certain
other nodes, than I might easily be able to deduce the
identity of nodes two hops back or forward!  So much
for extending this to middle nodes or making client
exit nodes the third hop!  I guess you guys already
had that figured all out before suggesting the current
exit node idea and not taking it any further! :)
Of course, opening a connection to every other tor
node has its problems too, for starters many cheap
firewalls will potentially choke under the connection
load.  I think that the client exit node is a great idea
though and really merits more thought.  The browser
plugin issue really is a separate issue and is just an
implementation issue.  Anyone is free to implement the
tor protocol right?  Whether anyone uses it is up to
them?  I agree with most of the technical complaints
about the plugin though, although it is not uncommon
for me to leave my browser open for days at a time.

pseudo-exit node less responsible for any abuses
exiting it along with trying to prevent its IP from
being filtered by web sites right?  If so, simply
making the client-exit node not log where it connected
to should be enough right?  Why try and hide the
pseudo-exit node anymore than that, especially if it
is not enhancing the anonymity of the tor user?  After
all, even if the pseudo-exit node were identified, it
could not be statically filtered if it uses different
client-exit nodes all the time right?  The client-exit
nodes will end up being filtered instead.  What am I

Hmm, storage level redundancy is not very useful for
anti-censorship.  All an attacker has to do is attack
one node and have it write new data which clears the
old data and it will clear the data on the
backup/redundant storage.  The data redundancy needs
to be managed from a higher level so that it would be
hard to communicate with (not just locate) the backup
location.  Imagine raid being done from your editing
browser to the various servers, but only your browser
knows the IP/"hidden tor hashed ID" of the servers.
Somewhere in tor land I read about a project which
would do much of what you describe, but I can't
remember what it was called.  It used regular accounts
on various services, free email accounts, open wikis,
newsgroups, freenet... to store encrypted data so that
no one would even know what was stored in these
accounts and it automatically made these copies
redundant.  The data was only accessible to those with
the proper keys (a lot like in "The Lodging of

more extensible in some sense than most other

I will not make a specific judgment that konqueror is
better or worse than firefox, but I certainly would
not rule it out so quickly.  The default install of

turning certain things off such as java, javascript,
browser-id strings, adds, plugins, various file/MIME

Interesting idea for sure!
One could imagine an ISP providing a catonion router service to its customers that would perform such a translation as a service to its customers giving them access to hidden services without requiring tor.  Obviously this would only be valuable if those customers did not require anonymity themselves.

@_subject: Firewalled relays 
I recall a discussion from last spring about the possibility of adding support for exit nodes behind firewalls.  If I recall correctly, the general idea was to add these nodes as a fourth hop in the tor network.  This allowed these nodes to connect to "pseudo exit" nodes which would be the third hop.  Since these 4th hop nodes were initiating the connection to the 3rd hop, they could do so from behind firewalls which would normally prevent incoming connections to the node.  I have an alternative but similar suggestion which may have fewer limitations than the previous model and hopefully will also alleviate some of the anonymity/abuse concerns with the previous suggestion.
The idea is to allow firewalled relays in the tor network in general.  Firewalled relays would always have to initiate all connections between themselves and other tor relays or clients.  The only limit to interconnections that these relays would have would be that they could not connect with other firewalled relays (although even that could be lifted in some cases with firewall hole punching). To achieve this, firewalled relays would borrow an idea from hidden services and register rendezvous points with the directory servers.  The rendezvous points would have to be with non-firewalled relays.  Unlike hidden services though, these rendezvous points need not be 3 hops into the cloud, they need only be single hops.  Upon startup, a firewalled relay would initiate and establish a connection to at least one non-firewalled relay and register that connection as a rendezvous point.
The rendezvous points would only be used to tell firewalled relays that another relay or a client wanted to relay through the firewalled relay.  Anyone wishing to establish a connection with a firewalled relay would contact them through the tor network as a client would making 3 hops before hitting the rendezvous point (this contact would be as anonymous as any other tor usage).
Once a client or non-firewalled relay contacts a firewalled relay through the rendezvous point indicating its desire to relay through it, the firewalled relay will initiate a connection back to the relay or client asking to relay though it.  From there on out the firewalled relay would behave as a regular relay.
With this design, any traffic using the firewalled relay would undergo a normal 3 hop path through the tor network just like other normal tor traffic.  The rendezvous points would only be used to communicate desired connections but not to carry traffic.  Setup time for connections would increase, but throughput should be unaffected.

Yes, but exit nodes already no where your traffic is going (and on which port), middle and entrance nodes do not.  If they did, it would defeat the purpose of tor I believe.  Anonymity of requests is not limited to decoupling the destination IP from the user, but also to decoupling the type of traffic (i.e port) to the user, don't you think?

@_date: 2009-02-18 17:38:08
@_author: Martin Fick 
@_subject: Bittorrent 
Yes, wow my English was pretty poor in that post, sorry. ;)
I guess I misunderstood you, sorry.  It sounded like you were suggesting that middle nodes treat such data differently.  I guess you were only referring to exit nodes then?
Makes sense, if you are suggesting to add prioritization to exit nodes only.  Additionally, I would suggest that per port (and even destination IP) rate limiting (instead of prioritization) would be more useful in some cases.  For example, prioritization would be good for bittorrent
since it is primarily considered abusive to the tor netowork, but may well not (opinions on this vary surely)
be used to abuse services outside of tor.  Thus, if the
bandwidth is there, why not let tor transport such
traffic since it would not then be hurting tor?
On the other hand email is an example where perhaps rate
limiting would be a better solution?  Since spammers may
use tor to abuse people outside of tor even if there is
plenty of bandwidth in the tor network.  As much as I hate SPAM, it always bothered me that the default exit
policy (for good reason) prohibits the use of port 25.
Since there are very good legitimate reasons to want to
email anonymously, a very low bandwidth rate for email
might still make it usable for emailing anonymously but
not for SPAM.
Today, if you want to us tor for email you are probably
severely limiting your exit node choices which means
that you may be compromising your anonymity.  Yet, there
may still be some high bandwidth exit nodes which allow
port 25 making it useful for spammers but not for other anonymity seekers!  With rate limiting, you could make the default exit policy extremely bandwidth restrictive for port 25,
but yet still open.  This would mean that anonymity
would potentially be improved without making tor more
attractive to spammers.  In fact, overall port 25
bandwidth could even potentially be decreased in the
tor network without detracting from email anonymity.
In other words, from an anonymity standpoint, it
seems like you would ideally want all exit nodes to open up every port, even if they drastically rate limit the 'evil'/abuse oriented ports?
This way if you have to use a service on the evil port, you can still do it without sacrificing
anonymity (by being severely limited in you exit node selection), but you may have to suffer a very slow connection making abuse less likely.
If you are really creative (and desperate,) ;) you could probably already achieve port rate limiting
by just running several exit nodes with different exit policies and bandwidths.  And prioritization and rate limiting could probably both be achieved by adjusting the bandwith and CPU of the nodes with some OS parameters, i.e. nice+20 for CPU and other mechanisms for network usage.

@_date: 2009-02-18 18:53:15
@_author: Martin Fick 
@_subject: Bittorrent 
Agreed, both valid criticisms.  All the more reason to add this to the exit policy so that it is not "circumvented"
the way I suggested! ;)
But do you see any reason that this applies to the non OS tricks solution of simply having two exit nodes with different policies solution that I suggested?
If we are to assume that both nodes would actually be running on the same host, the limited bandwidth to the 'evil' port exit node would not (noticeably) inhibit the overall tor middle node bandwidth (versus the single exit alternative) since the other peer would be assumed to provide enough middle node bandwidth, right?  And,
there would be no "cheating" of service reporting then I have to note though, that the FAQ:
suggests something slightly like this already:
  "5.17. What bandwidth shaping options are available to Tor relays?
  ...
  Linux-based Tor nodes have another option at their disposal:   they can prioritize Tor traffic below other traffic on their   machine, so that their own personal traffic is not impacted   by Tor load. A script to do this can be found in the Tor   source distribution's contrib directory."
Perhaps this should be caveatted?

@_subject: Bittorrent (rate limiting vs. prioritization) 
...rate limiting ... prioritization...
I don't quite agree, they really are two very different
solutions to address two different problems.  Prioritization
addresses a threat to the tor network itself, whereas rate limiting addresses using tor to abuse others.  So, it is not just an ease of implementation issue, but two very different Well, of course, neither am I. ;)
I disagree, as soon if you keep the total tor network
bandwidth allocated to a very small number on port25 (to exagerate, say 1 K per hour), there is very little reason to believe that spammers would use tor at all.  It would be completely useless to them.  However, it may still be useful to a whistle blower who really needs to stay anonymous since he may eventually get his message through and he now has a larger choice of exit nodes
to choose from to protect his anonymity.
You may or may not have enough bandwidth left for normal
users, but there is a chance you may actually have more
since you will have hopefully eliminated the spammers
use of the tor network (are there actually any?).  The objective is to make it possible to keep the same amount of bandwidth for port 25 as there currently is available, but to better distribute that bandwidth across exit nodes to improve anonymity without incurring a greater spam hit.
Exactly what I don't want for port 25 since it will
only encourage spam usage of the network.
Agreed!!! ;)

@_subject: Obfuscated URLs? 
They provide an obfuscation to a service that you must
run, not an obfuscation of a URL, this is not the same
functionality.? It's like the difference between an
email address and an email server.? Related, but very
Well, I do not think that you are really giving
hidden services proper consideration.? While setup
is certainly part of the problem, the real kicker,
of course, just like running your own web server,
is running it!? Maintenance and availability are the real issues (hosting).? Even many people with the skills to setup their own servers (email, http...) still pay for someone to host them (even though they might personally admin it remotely).? So the biggest barrier is hosting, not setup.? Hosting requires the publisher to be permanently active, to have a PC always connected to the internet, and to personally be linked to the content.? The last part is not just an issue of anonymity, suppose that my identity is already known, how could I ever host content that
someone wants to censor without the risk of being
raided (and the content thus censored) since my identity is already known?
The alternative, remote hosting anonymously is hard, as soon as you add payment to the deal, it adds
a whole new level of risk to blowing you or your
hosts anonymity, again making censorship more
Risks aside, if you look at non-tor stuff, how many individuals are willing to run their own email server, web server?? Very few.? Why would adding an extra layer (tor) to the mix, even if setup became much easier, suddenly make people more likely to host their own server?? Of course, it wouldn't.? This means your are starting with a too small pool
of potential personal hidden service hosts in the first place.? However, how many people have email accounts (virtually everybody)?  How many are subscribed to some forum, or internet group, or blogging site
with some mechanism to publish to free accounts?? Not quite as many as the people with email accounts, but quite a large number nevertheless.
These are the people that this targets as a potential publishing base.? This number is much higher than those who run personal web servers.? This is an entirely different "demographic" than those running hidden services.
Hidden services are a genius hack, they provide
interactivity, something all the other censor free
systems do not.? But, interactivity is not always
needed.? Why force a mechanism designed for dynamic
content (and thus more difficult and riskier to implement) onto static content when their is an easier (*1) and potentially more robust solution that tor could implement for static content? *1 If indeed it is easy, of course, the devil is    in the details. :(
Those are some of the things that I am suggesting, yes.
But, I am not limiting it to those.  If you limit your
thinking to that, then, of course, systems that only implement that will look appealing. :)
I think you are effectively talking about a hidden
remapping (not redirecting) proxy.? Yes, this would work, but it is not a "good" solution.? Again, it suffers from the same hosting requirement and does not reduce risk much.? Additionally, this would require each implementer to come up with their own implementation, make bugs and disclosure that more
likely (not peer reviewed...)
Thanks for the link, I will investigate more.? But,
again, this looks like a distributed storage mechanism, not a URL obfuscator.? It is useful and
likely better at doing some of the things that Obfuscated URLs could do, but not all of them.? What I am proposing does not push the content into the tor system as most distributed storage systems do.? It is an access, not a storage method.
And, of course, I am proposing using tor for my
purposes, I do not want to add another system to
my arsenal.  As soon as you do, it becomes very
complicated to work with 2, 3... systems simultaneously.? As a resource contributor, do I contribute to tor, to freenet, to gnunet, to offsystem...?? Each one of these systems that I contribute to takes bandwidth from the other.? This is less than ideal.? I believe in many of the objectives of many of these systems and dream of a unified
way to achieve and contribute to them all.
Fragmentation has its advantages, particularly
during the research phases.  tor is maturer
than most technologies, but eventually many of
the other systems will implement more and more
common functionality.  If they can do more than tor, even if they are not quite as good
at tor's specialty, eventually they might
obsolete tor and everyone will suffer since we
will be using sub par implementations.  Tor
needs to continue getting better at what it is
good at, but if it can also expand its capabilities it will likely help expand its user, contributor, and developer bases also.
Yes, in fact, I would suggest that documents be store
as .pgps at the real location.? But to be clear, the
intent of the encryption that I was talking about was
to make the obfuscation better, not to control access.? In other words, it prevents someone from guessing the location of the obfuscated URL and seeing if their guess is correct by attempting to compare the data
retrieve via the obfuscated URL and via going directly
to their guessed location.? Obviously they can still
compare file sizes...
One additional reason that storing documents as pgps would be nice is because then the documents do not appear to be tor specific documents, they do not shout: "here is an obfuscated URL document!" :)
I hope that some of this makes more sense, cheers,

@_subject: Obfuscated URLs? 
It is not inconceivable that an .onion to Obfuscated URL mapping mechanism similar to hidden services could be managed within directory servers also.? Granted, this may cause a scalability problem in the directory servers much earlier than the hidden service mechanism will since we are talking about separate mappings for each URL instead of an entire host.? Nevertheless, an application run by the publisher could conceivably register several Obfuscated URLs to a single .onion URL address (each mapping potentially to different real URLs).? These .onion URL addresses would be shorter URLs and since they would map to multiple obfuscated URLs, they would automatically provide a form of redundancy.
A ".onion URL address" to "obfuscated URL" mapping would also provide an update mechanism for the publisher.? The update might be used to simply move the content.? It might be used to layer a dynamic content system on top of the static one by updating to a new URL upon writing.  And, of course, it might also be used to react to downed (dependent) tor relays.? This last feature should make the availability of a document just as good (likely better) than that of a hidden service since now the publisher only needs to monitor the availability of his documents (and provide potentially new paths to them) instead of serving them.? This "availability" monitoring is much less risky and demanding than hosting a hidden service, since it only requires polling periodically as opposed to maintaining a permanent net connection.
Obsolete Mappings:
In order for it to be possible to update .onion
URL addresses to new obfuscated URLs, some protection mechanisms would be required to prevent others from falsely updating the address.? Two ideas spring to mind, both likely useful to implement: 1) Allow a hash of the content of the address ???to be specified by the publisher, and 2) Allow the obfuscated URLs to be signed by ???the publisher.
With the addition of a hashing verification mechanism for .onion addresses, the tor network
could assure to users that an obfuscated URL does indeed return the content represented by the .onion URL address.? Such a verification mechanism would in fact allow friendly users
to help mirror and maintain the obfuscated links
to the content since they could submit new
obfuscated links to the mapping and as long as
the content matches the hash, the mapping should
be accepted regardless of who submits it!
This is now a much bigger availability maintenance leap ahead of hidden services for static content since it potentially enlists
The mapping signing would be more useful when
the content is expected to change and updates
to the tor network itself are not desired. This way, the content can be updated externally,
but path/obfuscated URL maintenance could still be done securely by the original Many ideas here, some probably better than
others.  However, I hope that this helps illustrate what might eventually be possible with the obfuscated URL idea.

Well, unfortunately that just isn't the case.  Many
people have different (political) opinions on just
what exactly human rights means.  It is not so simple
as you would think (I wish it were).  For example, this
declaration (which is used by the UN) is full of political (and even contradictory) ideas, and "rights".
Again, I am not trying to start a debate about what
human rights should be (this is the wrong place for that), but just to point out that unfortunately it
is pretty hard to make the "non-political" claim
you probably wish were true.
To be more illustrative of my "political point", the following "rights" would be considered
by most to be socialist ideas:
* Article 22
* Article 23 - 1
* Article 25 - 1,2
* Article 26 - 1
* Article 29 - 1
The following are pro democracy:
* Article 21 - 3
Articles which are pro-property rights (and sound very contradictory to the socialist articles above):
* Article 17 - 2
Pro intellectual property "rights":
* Article 27 - 2
And this is just to me the obvious political ones, but
someone biased differently than me could probably point
out very different "political" articles than the ones
I did.
Agreed, and I wish we could all agree, but I certainly don't agree with several of the articles
mentioned above (and I am often disgusted when asked

Again this is not to say that ICANN cannot reak havok, particularly to individuals, just that if they do badly enough, the world will just switch to some other agreed upon authority(ies) and ICANN will become meaningless.  They truly can only govern because the governed consent to their governing, they have no physical pull, they are not backed by But, since ICANN does have the power to potentially affect individuals, it might make directory servers owned by other
non US governments much harder to foil (by ICANN) than those owned by individuals.  I surmise this because I think that if ICANN decided to attack the server owned by a government instead of an individual it would likely be seen as ICANN attacking the entire country.  The country has more power and
influence with those who follow ICANN than most individuals do.  Just a thought...

But, just for grinns, how would ICANN go about attacking
an individual host anyway?  Surely they cannot revoke my
personal IP, could they?  My ISP owns that now, not ICANN,
right?  For them to revoke the block that my ISP owns, it
would be a major time consuming task wouldn't it?  That
would mean that while they may be targeting me individually,
they would have to be attacking many others, including my
ISP inadvertently.  Surely, by the time the attack were
successful (years presumably?) I would have simply opened another account with another ISP, perhaps even in another
country and gotten my self another IP, no?
I do not think this is even a close threat to the original

@_subject: Obfuscated URLs? 
Obfuscated URL Paths?
Would it be possible to create a URL or some longer string that describes a hidden path through the tor network to a specific hidden URL and to implement a routing mechanism to access documents (files) using this "Obfuscated URL"?
I am fully aware of hidden services, and I am suggesting something that I think is quite different.  I am suggesting a way to point someone to a file on the normal non-hidden internet without telling them where I am pointing to!  I envision an onion encrypted URL along with the exact path through tor (the three hops) also onion encrypted.  This would be similar to the way a client normally wraps requests through tor, but the wrapping would happen up front and then the wrapper would become the "Obfuscated URL" which could be handed off to someone else obfuscating both the path through tor and the final destination to the person receiving the "Obfuscated URL".  Obviously, this would not allow a user to chose their own route through tor to maintain anonymity according to their standards,
so allowing them to route through 3 original nodes before using the obfuscated URL inside the tor network might be necessary.
This I believe should be similar to the way accessing hidden
services works (3 hops in, 3 hops out).
The hard part is that it seems like it would also be necessary
to layer a document fetching mechanism ontop of tor instead of simply wrapping TCP to make this effective though?  If not,
obfuscating the URL from the fetcher is likely to be useless since end point servers are likely to divulge their locations via most protocols (headers...).  Would there be an easier way, to avoid this disclosure than creating a new fetching protocol?  Perhaps, by adding a built-in simple obfuscating proxying mechanism such as polipo on the exit side?
The intent of the Obfuscated URL would not necessarily be to maintain long term obfuscation of the URL (could it?), but at least to be the basis of a mechanism that would allow users to publish hard to censor anonymous content without a hidden service.  Perhaps the user changes the hidden location every now and then in case the real URL is eventually disclosed, but it the obfuscation mechanism works for a long enough time, in some case, this might be a lot easier and safer than using a hidden service (easier to change the location, ability to use free web space anonymously...).  Of course, I neglected to mention how the user would publish their obfuscated URLs in the first place, but that problem exists with onion URLs also?
Any thoughts?  Crazy, useless, impossible...

Thanks, for the feedback...
Yes, it probably is a path that one would take while
designing hidden services.? However, I think that it
is a different fork of the main thought process that
leads to a different (not better, but better for somethings) use case.
Agreed, a single path encoding is a weak point, but this
may be acceptable in some cases.? Also, other mechanisms
could eventually be built on top of this mechanism to replicate a document to several places and provide several obfuscated URLs to the same content.  This suddenly makes this content much less vulnerable to single points of failure than a hidden service, hopefully. :)
I agree that it is optimized for this, but I hardly
think that you could make the claim that static content
has no place in tor, could you?  Anti censorship is not
just about dynamic content, visit onion land for plenty
of static content examples.
...not to mention that dynamic systems could potentially
be layered on top of this static mechanism, again hopefully. :)

@_subject: Obfuscated URLs? 
Yes, I attempt to address the weak link idea in my reply to the previous poster, however a suggestion to eliminate this weak link is obviously desired.  In my scenario, the point of hard coding the path is to obfuscate the final URL, how could this be done differently?  In this scenario, it requires all 3 nodes to decrypt the final URL, one node by itself cannot, this should provide the same protection that you get
today by surfing with tor, should it not?
I don't see why this is more open to abuse than the
general tor network, could you explain your reasoning?
As for use cases, I envision that as a simple whistle blower or reporter, I would post my content on various free forums in an encrypted file and publish an obfuscated URL and password to the content.  This would be a lot simpler publishing mechanism, especially with helper programs potentially designed for this, or by adding the encryption directly to tor (and the password to the obfuscated URL) thus eliminating the need for the extra password, than setting up and maintaining a hidden service, and perhaps safer with respects to protecting my own anonymity.
Again, as I mentioned to the previous poster, I
could make several URLs to the same content posted
in different places, this completely eliminates
the single point of failure which a hidden service
does not.  Of course, I could setup several hidden
services, but I think that you can see how that
would be much more complex than what I am Add the extra encryption layer mentioned in my previous paragraph and I think that the content could be as well, or better protected than with a hidden service.

I don't think that system is like what I am suggesting.  I will have to read more (it does sound cool), but it sounds a lot more like freenet.  I am not just talking about a system to create distributed storage (although it would be nice to be able to do so with what I am suggesting), but a
mechanism to hide stuff on the normal internet.  Maybe I just want to send you a URL to an article
but don't want you to know where that article is
hosted so as to not bias you towards its content!
Lastly, just because some other projects achieve similar objectives to what tor achieves does not mean that tor is useless.  I suspect many of these systems will eventually achieve similar results coming from different angles.  I see that as a good thing, not a bad thing, especially since it is hard to know what is the best implementation before hand.  I hardly think that anyone would complain if tor could magically replace all those other systems without compromising it's stated objectives, do you?  Surely, it would be nice to not have to install another system to deal with one slightly different use case.

@_subject: Naive proposal for a complete tor redesign 
As the subject says, what I am proposing is likely to be completely naive and full of bad assumptions and errors, but here it goes anyway. ;)  Perhaps my suggestion will spawn other smarter more creative thinkers than me.
I can't help but wonder (especially after reading the recently published paper on potential tor performance improvements,) if perhaps a simpler approach to onion routing should be sought, particularly one that leverages other technologies more?
It seems to me that tor can be thought of as a coperation between two primary mechanisms enabled by a third.  The first and formost mechanism is that of 3(4?) open NATting routers.  The second mechanism is that of several VPNs.  The VPN mechanisms are primarily there to disguise the results of the primary mechanism.  Lastly, the third enabling mechanism is that of a directory server, an information dissemination mechanism.  Naturally, I have to then ask, why does tor reinvent each of these?  Why can it not make use (please excuse my ignorance if you think that it already does) of current existing technologies which already provide, probably more efficiently, these mechanisms?
Here is what I have in mind: it seems to me that a simple onion routing relay could be created by combining a VPN endpoint, a NATting package forwarder, and a simple application which publishes details about the relay to a directory.  A relay would publish the keys to access its VPN(s) and would forward any packets which come in via it (them) to their destination (like a simple router) while performing NAT on them.
Technology wise, I can envision several competing mechanisms to achieve each of these pieces.  Ideally it would be possible to use whatever combination one chooses for each piece allowing mixed implementations.  On the hardware support side, one could imagine using simple generic home routers to implement the two primary pieces.  Many of them support VPNs now, and, of course, most of them support NAT.  On the software side, a unix or unix like OS which can perform packet forwarding with NATting at the OS level, while running openvpn in user space, would be logical.  A VM solution such as qemu or virtualbox could also be used to run this OS (relay) on windows or other OSes.  Lastly an OS level container system such as solaris zones or linux containers (bsd jails?) could be used to isolate a relay if virtualization is not used and one wishes to use the relay for other purposes also.
Once a technology has been chosen for VPNs and the NAT router, a tor specific application would be needed on the relay to publish the relay's info and perhaps help manage the VPNs and NAT router:  setting up VPNs, routes, and various filtering rules (to implement exit policies.)
The way I envision a client working, (after contacting directory servers and deciding upon routes,) would be to start by setting up a VPN to an entry relay.  Next, a custom OS route to the middle relay would be setup, this route would set the entry relay as the gateway.  Now the client could open a VPN to the middle relay (via the OS route and VPN to the entry relay).  Once this VPN is established, another custom OS route will be added:  this time the route will be for the exit node and it will point to the middle node as the gateway.  With a route to the exit node, it should become possible to establish a third VPN to the exit node.   I believe that all of this would additionally require enabling packet forwarding on the local OS.  Finally, either the local IP could be set to some common default (say 192.168.1.2), or some local NATting rule could be used to make it look so to each VPN.  From there on out, things should take care of themselves as long as
 the proper keys were used, right? ;)
This could potentially mean that both UDP and TCP tunneling would be possible (subject to any NATting deficiencies).  Hopefully this onion transport would be much more efficient since it would likely be using UDP, but it should be possible to use a variety of technologies as lons as the VPN solution is fairly common.  With this, advances (and faults) in VPN and packet forwarding technologies would be automatically available to tor.  From a performance standpoint, tor could focus more on the higher level stuff such as: what is needed to perform optimum routing, how to deal with various network abuses, etc.
The other major piece I did not touch on yet, is the directory servers.  Here too it seems like tor should attempt to leverage other technologies, and could perhaps even take advantage of many of them.  The most obvious one would be to use ldap.  But, perhaps tor could look to other information sharing networks to see how it can leverage them:  bitorrent, freenet... By creating an API to layer the tor directory services ontop of other sharing protocols, tor lookups might be able to benefit from their respective strengths.  It may become easier to disguise that a client is even using tor.  It may become easier to disguise directory servers.  It may make directory services more immune to DOS attacks, imagine storing directory info in freenet.  Using bitorrent may alleviate any future directory server scalability issues.  Some of these technologies might also make setting up darknets more easy.
Lastly, it seems like even hidden services could potentially be easily supported by adding a NAT whole punching assistant on each tor relay to act as a potential introduction point.
Again, forgive me, if I glossed over really important details and sound like I am hand waiving over the hard stuff.  I do not expect anyone to jump up and say "Hallelujah, a great new way to do things!"  I realize that even if what I am suggesting is possible, that it will be fraught with new potential problems.  Nevertheless, I figured that if I simply spark some "out of the box" thinking it might be valuable.  An very naive me even thinks that it might not be terribly hard to prototype such a solution?  One final thought:  if several of these technologies are better leveraged, it might make it easier for new developers/admins, people familiar with just one of these pieces, to get more involved with tor development.  Currently, I could not envision myself getting involved developing tor, it is probably way above my head.  However, if tor were less of a monolithic application, but rather a joining of technologies, it might (might not) be more approachable/hackable?
Thanks for listening,

... Is there an easily implementable variant of this which would allow the connections between relays to combine all of the connections into a single connection.  With the above suggestion, it seems like each connection between relays would happen on separate ports making it easier to distinguish data streams.  My next thought would be to setup an additional VPN between each relay that is currently speaking to each other which would carry all the VPNs between them.  This would make each relay much more complicated tough, since it would have to detect connections to new relays and setup a VPN to them (and potentially tear them down when no longer used).  Can anyone think of an easier/simpler way?

Yes.  In fact, that would probably be the criteria of a "perfect" hash, wouldn't it?  If not, your hash is biased, which has it's own set of problems.  If
the hash is biased, it is not an effective hash.
Yes, or with a biased hash a few more combinations

No guarantees, but that is the objective of a
good hash.  It is the criteria by which the hash is evaluated.  A hash which simply returns
the same value on each input is a bad hash, but
it would make it hard to force a specific output if it were not that one value. :)
I assume you meant ~720?
I think you proved my point.  The "weakness" you are referring to is because your hash is biased.
No, you did not strengthen it, you weakened it
by further biasing it.  If you had strengthened
the hash, it would have been easier to get all
1024 values.
The biasing will indeed make it harder to select
certain nodes, but, of course, it will mean that
the other nodes will be biased and easier to select.  The more biasing, the more similar everyone's paths would be defeating the whole purpose of your proposal:  randomness.
It is an interesting idea to force randomness,
and it might have value in some cases (?),
but I do not think that this method could even
approach it.

Ah, you mean the file protocol.  Firefox itself tends to have this disabled by default also.  One of the reasons is to prevent malicious users from including file:// urls in an external webpage.  With file:// urls, a webpage could be designed to test for the existence of local files on your computer.  From an anonymity standpoint, if I can run a test that verifies the existence of a specific file on your computer, one that I can prove only you would have on your computer, then I might be able to prove that you loaded my webpage.  I suspect there are also ways potentially execute some local code on your computer by accessing local files (depending on the OS, this might be harder or easier to achieve).  If that's the case, perhaps depending on the program, by executing it locally, I might be able to detect this remotely.  Maybe the program does something as simple as a DNS lookup that I can sniff and then correlate to you...
And, finally, just because a file is accessed via a file:// url does not mean it is actually accessing a file locally.  It is accessing a file via your local file system namespace, but this might be on a remotely mounted drive/share making the remote server able to detect/prove this access, once again, exposing your access of a webpage by at least the owner of the remote server/share.

@_subject: Reducing relays = reducing anonymity ? Tortunnel. 
Although, I can't help but think that with equal resources, the use of a single system could have
benefits too:  shared code paths (and thus potentially better debugged), better load balancing, more traffic to mix with for those
loving company (anonymity seekers)...
To be more specific about what I mean by "equal
resources": suppose that users of system X have 5 relays, and tor has 5 relays, and both
sets of users used the same bandwidth.  If all users used one 10 relay system instead, the total bandwidth should be similar.
I can't help but think that there are indeed other use cases that would greatly benefit from a independent simpler transport-type lower-layer that tor could ride on.  If this layer could have more users and more resources (relays/coders) dedicated to it than just the resources that tor currently gets, it could be a net win for tor.
I proposed something like this a year or two
ago and have done nothing with it.  I keep coming back to the idea though.  I just recently started playing with the concept again, I was going to call it PNR for Private Natting Router.  Essentially attempting to define a very simple OpenVPN setup ontop of some natting firewall rules and IP forwarding.  A simple system would then define a way to add restrictions and extra capabilities to such a setup and to publish them along with status info.  Restrictions might be something like: "can only connect to these other PNRs" (act as a middle node), or "can only go to
the internet via port 80" (exit node restriction).  A capability might be something like the ability to tunnel "connections to other individual points via a single VPN" (to make separate input
streams aggregate into a single output stream), or to aggregate/delay packages for potentially better mixing.
All of this would create more of a research environment where new models could be experimented with and still potentially benefit from a common deployed foundation. It would be possible to explore many new
transport layer speed/latency/bandwidth
optimisations independently from anonymity issues.  It might make exploring resource management (charging for/exchanging for bandwidth...) easier. An implementation of
tor could be designed to ride on such an infrastructure.  This implementation would embody many of the very clever things that
tor does today, good route selection, directory services...
I keep searching for that use case where
a user does not need anonymity for any individual query, but does on the aggregate level.  Perhaps this is something some users want, i.e. to never access different sites from the same IP.  Such a use case would be very effectively achieved with many single hop relays.
Although I can see why tor is not interested in catering to such users, I
can't help but think that they could
help disguise traffic for users requiring strong anonymity and they
could potentially add to the resource
pool that tor uses, to ultimately
benefit tor as a whole.

with a private internal IP (say 192.168.1.2)
and appropriately firewalled from the internet
via a NATting router (likely with a spoofed
MAC) so that it can only speak with other
tor nodes (or bridges) on the appropriate
ports, could this node if compromised, still
gain identifying info about itself from its
network connections (ignoring iternal
hardware info leaks)?  Does the tor project
have preventing this type of info leaking,
from this "internal" attack vector, as an
objective?  Should it, could it?

I suspected so.  Do you agree that it would
be valuable if the change were possible?  It
seems like changing the protocol to use another port (to easily be able firewall it)
to get sensitive info for bridges and relays
might make clients and hidden services much
more easily securable.  I realise that this
likely a major change, but if it could make
all tor users much more secure... (would To unsubscribe, send an e-mail to majordomo at torproject.org with

I think that simply getting high profile sites to run to r
nodes would be more likely and less invasive to the internet as a whole.  If google were to simply run a bunch of bridges, or even known tor entry nodes, that would likely
be more reliable and be less pie in the sky.
If you compare the advocacy it would take to get enough ISPs to implement this scheme versus the advocacy to get
a few high profile (can't live without them) sites to run
tor nodes, I suspect the latter would be much easier.

Since such discussions are generally likely to be highly opinion based, it would help if you gave
technical reasons for your opinions.  Both of your preferred solutions will have much higher performance overheads than any container like solution (OpenVz, Vserver, lxc...).  I see no glaring reason why any of those container solutions could not be used. I use a Vserver,
on a very low BW link,

Hmm, I am surprised by the EFFs advice here. It it is legal as they claim, shouldn't they be heralding us to run an exit node at home and not

that they will help defend us in case of an issue?  After all, they are recommending open wireless

I don't think that this would make for a best practice,
I think that a linux lxc should be encouraged instead,
it is way more efficient.
As fir isolation, I think that a best practice should use iptable rules.  But if you want to go the cheap hardware route, buy a $5/15 nic and add it to your box and plug that nic into your modem's DMZ port, most of them have one.

It is a server though, and every other application is
not.  Most home user's are not used to running and
securing servers.  While I may not have taken the

Could you be more specific?  I understand that
different people have different opinions/biases
of how secure a system is, but I don't think that anyone can make the claim that either of these two setups are more obviously secure than the other.  Both perform similar logical isolations, neither has the obvious advantage here.  Both have the potential to have the
isolation compromised by bugs, the full VM
solution has more code, so likely has a greater
attack surface, but that likely means little
in this argument.  If you think it is "simple", please explain on what basis you are making
this claim.
Since I do not think that it is a simple
evaluation to determine which solution is
more secure, and both solutions perform
a similar logical isolation (when not compromised), I would suggest that other
criteria be used to judge which solution
should be used to suggest to others as a
best practice.  Naturally, I would not
tell you that you are wrong for running
virtualbox, but I don't think that it is
a great solution for a best practice.  And, if you think that lxc is not appropriate for a best practice, please
provide some good reasons so that we can
all benefit.
I am sorry you don't, but many consumer-grade routers actually do have a DMZ port, it is certainly not out of the ordinary.

You have three choices when it comes to trusting something: 1) you can check yourself, 2) you can have someone you trust check, 3) you can trust an authority.
Having the source code enables option 1 and 2.  Option 3 is pretty much useless if your concern is authority in the first place, no?
So like it or not, having the source code is more
useful than anything else anyone can propose.  It
is not perfect, but it is the ONLY recourse that
has even a remote chance of being useful against
trusting authority.

I run mine in a linux vserver, it should run in lxc also,
those are both much more lightweight than a virtual

lxc does not require any patching.
With lxc, you can setup the network anyway you want,
it can be setup the same way you would setup a
VM.  What specifically are you gaining from using
a VM?

This is not true with a vserver, they use IP aliases,
and do not have raw access to the network interface
(unless you give them those specific capabilities).
With lxc you could give it that access, but you
could also firewall its interface from within the
host so that this is not possible (unless the host
is compromised).

Well, it appears that you do have a threat model in mind.
It seems that you are concerned with people using your
relay to attack your local machines.  Those are valid
concerns, that is the threat model you are hoping to
get advice against.
You have received some advice against it, but you do not
appear to understand this advice, which is fine, please
ask more questions then.
I think that your concerns are valuable, they often
concern me also, and I am sometimes surprised that
others are not concerned about this on their home
networks.  I agree that the tor project could provide
some more advice on dealing with this.
I suspect the reason that you don't see this is because
either most people assume it is just too hard, or to
those for whom it is not too hard, they just know how todo
it and think that it will be too hard to explain to others
(with good reason).  Nevertheless, it might be worth trying.
The reason you want to avoid this I suspect is because
you want to prevent someone from owning your relay,
and then attacking the rest of your network from inside
your local hardware firewall (likely a DSL or cable
modem)?  Is that correct?
The solution that I suggested with vservers will allow you
to prevent local network snooping (eavesdropping on packets
not intended for you vserver), but it will not prevent your
vserver from directly attempting to communicate with other
machines (including your host) inside your firewall unless
additional rules are added to your host, likely using
iptables or something like this.  Using lxc you would
likely want those same rules, but perhaps you would need
more to prevent eavesdropping.
It would be nice is someone who has done this could help
write a guide to do this.  If no one has done this yet, I
think that it would be valuable, and perhaps it should even
become recommended practice eventually.
Just my .02 cents,

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to make 100.000 bridge? 
Perhaps this is naive question, but has anyone considered targeting bridge users directly?  In other words, if someone lives in a censored region, why not make it trivial for them to run their own personal EC2 bridge?  This way it will likely never be blocked.  After all, wouldn't it be better to get volunteers to host relays or exit nodes than it would be to get them to host bridges?  Make it simple and easy for people to have their own bridges and no longer rely on volunteers for bridges at all.
Do bridges support a password or key to access them?  If so, then users could ensure that others are not using their personal bridge.  Access control might even help further disguise such bridge from being probed and recognised as bridges?
This seems so obvious to me, that I suspect it is completely flawed...
