@_subject: Sudden increase in number of Tor nodes 
Any ideas why there have been *two* sudden increases in the number of
Tor nodes recently?
Take a look at the following graphs at torstat.xenobite.eu:
In weeks 8 and 12 there appear to be roughly 50 new nodes added in the
space of roughly one day.
Any ideas?
