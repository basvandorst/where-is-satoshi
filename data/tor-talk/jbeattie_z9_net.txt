@_subject: [tor-talk] rhel7 minimal install missing libevent 
Trying to install tor on rhel7 with a minimal install. libevent-2.0.21-4.el7.x86_64 is installed but when I do yum install tor it requires libevent. I have the tor.repo installed and set to use the el7 distribution. Anyone else have this problem or solution?
