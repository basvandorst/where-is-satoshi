There's an old (leftover from initial testing/eval) fingerprint associated
with my relay in Globe/Atlas. As a result it shows down, I don't get any of
the data, etc.
Can I somehow manually publish the new one, while keeping the same
nickname? Or can someone on your side remove my entry so it can repopulate
fully next time it checks in?
The blutmagie mirror reflects my relay's details correctly, just not Atlas
or Globe.
Any insight is definitely appreciated. I'm looking forward to getting this
sorted out!

Hi Karsten,
Thanks for your willingness to help and your prompt reply! I suppose I
should have included the specifics from the get go!
To clarify, when I said I don't get any of the data, I just meant the
bandwidth, uptime, etc that Atlas and Globe can report.
The relay name is ravenswood.
Old fingerprint, ideally no longer associated with ravenswood =
Current (new) fingerprint = FF8D C579 8809 5FA7 95EB 3AFD 22EF 1E89 3531
It's the same piece of hardware, so there's only one ravenswood at this
Accurate posting from blutmagie:
Old fingerprint, from Globe:
Old fingerprint, from Atlas:
I hope this helps. Please let me know what else I can provide or do to help
- thanks!

Good to know. I figured it wasn't anything I could change/fix on my side.
I really appreciate your help!
Take care,

Yep. I see it. Looks great! And from your previous communication it sounds
like the old entry will age out once it's been 7 days since last check-in.
So that's cool.
Happy to have helped locate a bug. For now I'm all set, so there's no rush
from me.
Thanks again for your definitively awesome support!
