@_subject: OT: user who was trying to use EV-DO card with OpenBSD 
============================== START ==============================
Ok, this is off topic, but I'm trying to find out anyone who has had successful experiences with EVDO cards & OpenBSD, and this is the closest google hit I could find:
Anyone know what this person's email address is so that I could contact them directly to see if they got off of the stompbox/linux I love tor btw - I use it constantly, sorry this is totally off topic.
