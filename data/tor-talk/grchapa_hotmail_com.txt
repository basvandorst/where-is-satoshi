Hi once again. I was wondering if tor with thunderbird send information to the pop3/smtp servers, this is what i found out. I had to use thundebird ver 1.5.* with torbutton 1.0.4, and used the WireShark to capture packets.
While retrieving the mail this two readings where constant:
Frame 10 (60 bytes on wire, 60 bytes captured)

aa:aa:aa:2e:d4:89   is the actual mac address of the adapter in my router
ff:ff:ff:94:e0:d3       is the actual mac address of the adapter in my pc
CompName          is the name of my pc (faked :-)
I?m not an expert in reading packets, but, this is a leak ain?t it?

Thanks, 192.168.1.65 is the pc where i was running the test, and I turned off all programs while running it, I suppose something kept running; any way, this is obviously a mistake I made, the packages to look at would be  23 & 24 =>
thanks :-)
That would be the mainly thing I?m concerned about, does this dialog with the Tor network (which includes my mac addresses and computer name) goes beyond the entry guard?
Yes, it?s almost impossible to get any information with the headers of the (received) mail, is what information the email company receives I wonder .
Thanks anonym for your help,

Can any body point me in the right direction for installing tor with a gmail account in thunderbird? I think I installed right with a regular pop account - and this is the other question - but I don?t find a way to confirm this (like the browser in  I used 3proxy with the instructions in  now I wonder if tor works at all with gmail. And, may be there is a work around that I?m not aware, but the torbutton does not work for thunderbird, even the developer says so ( Any help will be

Thank you anonym,
I?ve found the version you told me and installed it (in a th v1.5.x), and as far as the headers info sent to the receiver it?s ok, it doesn?t leak any thing - only the client version - so it?s impossible to trace the email.
Now I just need to verify that there is no registration of mi ip & other info @ the smpt & pop servers; you told me to sniff the packets; I?m not to involved into sniffers and only used one or two times the wireshark, is there a special technique to do so?
