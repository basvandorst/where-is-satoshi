Funny. After "ulimit -n 1024" tor simply refuses to start ...
[daemon.warning] Warning from libevent: ioctl: DP_POLL: Invalid argument
[daemon.error] do_main_loop(): libevent poll with devpoll failed: Invalid argument [22]
decreasing the value to 512 gives me another error
[daemon.warning] set_max_file_descriptors(): We need 1024 file descriptors available, and we're limited to 512. Please change your ulimit -n.
[daemon.error] init_from_config(): Acting on config options left us in a broken state. Dying.
Using the default it at least seems to start and run for a couple of days. Until over 600M of real memory and over 850M of swap are "gone".

I'm trying to run a tor server on Solaris. Unfortunately the 0.1.0.14 server keeps dying every few days.
[daemon.error] _tor_realloc(): Out of memory. Dying.
I was hoping 0.1.1.x-alpha could solve this issue. It seems to compile just fine, but I'm not able to
really start it.
