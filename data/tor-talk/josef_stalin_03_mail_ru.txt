By the way, don't go near electric pool pumps when they are on.? If you do, people will somehow just know you are near it, even if they are behind a solid wall and cannot see you.? Then they will threaten you, call the police on you, and threaten to throw you in a mental instituion.? At least, that is what Roberta Wechter of 2507 Crystal Lake Dr, Spring Hill, Florida, USA did to Joseph Wechter of the same address this morning (12/06/2012).
Doesn't make much sense does it???

Could it be possible to make a Chrome browser extension which connected to Tor? ?Currently, the newest O/S on the market doesn't have Tor coded for it.
