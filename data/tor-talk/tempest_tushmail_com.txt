Juan Garofalo:
if you trust a vpn, what does that say about you? outting vpns for being
put into the situation of either complying with the law or facing
criminal sanctions themselves is counter productive. if one is truly
concerned about their anonymity, they shouldn't use a vpn. this is just
another example of why.

use longurl.org or someting similar to see where they go. It will
expand shortened links for you and give you the end result without
requiring javascript or complaining about tor.

i prefer debian as the base linux os and whonix for the virtual
machines. it's a good set up. there is a now somewhat dated tutorial
here on installing debian on a luks encrypted partition and then
installing virtual and whonix at
it's "dated" due to the fact that a new version of whonix has been
released and the tutorial deals with version 0.5.6. that shoudn't really
pose any problems though.
