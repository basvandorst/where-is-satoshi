@_subject: setting up port forwarding for tor server 
So I would need to open 9001/9030 for both inbound and outbound to the server?

: By default, orport is 9001 and dirport is 9030.  You can advertise
orport on 443 and dirport on 80 if you'd like.  The default settings of
9001/9030 mean you'll need to open up tcp/9001 and tcp/9030 through your
firewall/nat and point it at your tor middleman node.

@_subject: setting up port forwarding for tor server 
I am going to run a tor server (middle position-not exit) and I need to know which ports exactly I need to open for inbound\outbound on the router.
The server is already going to run ports 80, 443, 20, 21 and bittorrent in addition to tor.
I could not find a clear answer in the faq.

@_subject: tor server behind smoothwall 
I recently switched to a smoothwall firewall (info:  and for some reason my Tor server ports could not be accessed behind the green interface.
  The issue is definetely not port forwarding because I run web\ftp servers behind it with no problem.
  Does anyone know a solution? Smoothwall firewalls have very strong protection and might be blocking Tor in some way.

@_subject: [or-talk] tor server behind smoothwall 
Thanks so much for the tip!!
  I realized that I could just put the name of my dyndns.org account into the adress of vidalia (as you stated about DNS not affected), and it now says Tor can reach the ports. :)

 I'm just guessing here, as I don't run my Tor server behind an external firewall, but... If the smoothwall, like some firewalls, is doing some sort of NAT out the outgoing IP address, you may be adveritsing an incorrect IP address for your server. This wouldn't be as likely to affect WWW servers, where you publish the address yourself (e.g. through DNS) as it would be for Tor, which publishes it's own address.
I'd take a look at the Address line in your torrc, which may need to reflect the address of the smoothwall, rather than the internal address of your machine.
Again, this is just a guess, your configuration my be completely Good luck... :)

@_subject: Exit Node vs. Middleman Requirements 
Just wondering, is the Tor network in need of more bandwidth\servers? If so, are more exit-nodes or middle-man nodes required?

Will a reactive firewall affect a middle-node Tor server? I am planning to use a Smoothwall Linux firewall with the reactive mod ( I am concerned since when I ran a Tor server with Smoothwall, there were hundreds of entries logged in IDS (intrusion detection system).

@_subject: ISP TOS restrictions on servers 
I have Verizon DSL 3Mbps/768Kbps that I want to run a Tor middle-node server on. However Verizon's TOS prohibit any kind of servers. Do ISPs really care about whether people run servers on residential accounts and do they scan ports? If so, how often? Will they be able to decrypt the data from a middle node? Is it worth also running a public web\ftp server (on a different port than 80\21)? If they find out, will it be a warning letter or termination?
