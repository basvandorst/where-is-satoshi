@_subject: Question about tor and circuits. 
Am I correct in thinking that if tor only has one circuit active it will try to create more, or is this time based?
  If that is the case is it possible to get tor to stop creating circuits except where I have requested specific ones through the control interface.
  What I am attempting to do is use a Perl script I have created that uses the control interface to close down existing circuits, create a new one (with just one hop as I am not after anonymity) and then use it to retrieve a web page. This process is then repeated using different exit nodes.  Quite a simple project to start with, but I keep finding that when I list the circuits tor has created other ones so I don't know for certain which circuit is being used.

@_subject: Path Selection 
I am trying to get my head round the basics of the path selection for circuits.  I am putting together a simple simulator for tor networks to help me understand it and see what effects changing OR values has on the circuits built.  I have read  but I have a few questions.
  Are the choices of the ORs in the path all based on the advertised bandwidth (Is that the average bandwidth value or the observed)?
  Do the directory servers select which nodes can be Guards (Is there a criteria for this)?
  Does the individual client select a few Guards from the valid list of Guards and then only use them as the entry nodes?
  An OR being marked as Stable is really just a matter of it staying up and connected to the tor network for long enough?
  Jason.
