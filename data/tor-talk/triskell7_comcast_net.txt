I successfully loaded everything and got it to work except my TOR
browser.  It worked fine from 12.04.  I tried reloading the TOR Browser
bundle for my 64 bit linux system.  I got the following code instead of
'Congratulations you logged on' on my start up:
Normal display was not there.

Wasn't sure why I received this particular email, other than that I made
a request about a separate issue today.  I have been helped by the
person who wrote below several years ago on another issue.

THERE ARE TWO EQUALLY CONVINCING SOLUTIONS BELOW FROM UBUNTU
SINCE I HAVE A TERMINAL, THE FIRST CHOICE SEEMS BEST.
"start-tor-browser" only opens a gedit window, not tor.
I have the most recent version of the Tor Browser Bundle from
torproject.org. (tor-browser-gnu-linux-x86_64-2.3.25-6-dev-en-US.tar.gz)
When I extract it and double-click "start-tor-browser" the only thing
that happens is a gedit window opens with a ton of programming stuff.
Neither Tor Browser or Vidalia open. This has only happened since I
upgraded to Ubuntu 13.04. When I had Ubuntu 12.10 double-clicking
"start-tor-browser" opened everything up and all worked fine.  How do I
make double-clicking "start-tor-browser" open tor instead of a gedit window?
Give a right click at that start-tor-browser file and change at
permissions as Execute the file as program and then try again .
I checked "Allow executing file as program" and it did not work. The
gedit window is still opening instead of Tor.
Ok. Now open your terminal and execute the command as chmod +x
start-tor-browser;./start-tor-browser by changing to the directory where
you have placed the file.
MY COMMENTS IN CAPS: HOW DO I FIND THE PATH?
Find the path to the folder where the start-tor-browser is, and type
cd /path/to/folder, then ./start-tor-browser
When I click on a script in 13.04 (64) the script just opens in text
editor with no option to run it. The same script will run in 12.04
without trouble. Is this a bug, or does it have something to do with
Follow these steps:
Hit Alt+F2, type dconf-editor and hit Enter.
In dconfg-editor goto: org ? gnome ? nautilus ? preferences
Click on executable-text-activation and from drop down menu select:
launch: to launch scripts as programs.
ask: to ask what to do via a dialog.
Close dconf-editor. Thats it!
