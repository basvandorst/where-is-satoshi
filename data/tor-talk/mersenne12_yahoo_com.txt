@_subject: [tor-talk] tor with proxy 
Hi if I use tor with a proxy through the Advanced->settings-> HTTP proxy exactly what information does the proxy see? Is the request as private as what a website sees when you access it through tor. Is it any more possible for the proxy to trace you back than it would be if you were using a regular website?

When you download something say for example tor and you get the pop up message "external application is needed to handle" etc etc if you click the 'launch application' button does that mean you may lose tor protection and thus downloading with tor isn't safe?

It happens pretty much for every single download you can come across when in torbrowser

This is some kind of bug in TorBrowser/TorButton/Firefox.? It will actually just download (using your existing Firefox-Tor connection) and save the file when you click "launch application".
If you then launch an application to view the saved file, of course that application is not necessarily guaranteed to be using Tor for any internet access, unless you are running something like Tails.
