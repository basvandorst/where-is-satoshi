@_subject: [tor-talk] Hardened Tor Browser for Windows 
Excuse my ignorance but what exactly must happen for us to get a 64-bit
hardened Tor Browser for Windows? Not everyone in the world is running
Linux and not everyone can run Linux at work. I've been wondering about
this for awhile. Any info would be appreciated. TIA.

Why does everyone keep doing this? Stop thinking about computing only from
your perspective. It doesn't matter the reason why. People will want, will
need a Windows version of Tor. That's why the client already exists. I am
simply asking about getting the best version available to the public. Have
the choice available for any informed user. It is not possible to install
software in many environments (The Tor executable on Windows just extracts
so please don't try to argue this point) so installing VirtualBox or using
a LiveCD(DVD) or any of those other options are not available to everyone.
Sometimes it is really not about "I do not know" or "I am not comfortable
with Linux".
