@_subject: [tor-talk] msmtp + tor hidden services 
Hi. Sorry to bother you. You don't know me but I stumbled across your
tor-talk mailing list post regarding msmtp and tor hidden services
I know you wrote that in 2011, but I was wondering if you ever found a
solution to that problem. I have the same problem and I'm stuck :(
