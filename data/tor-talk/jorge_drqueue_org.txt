Hello Enigma,
It would be cool to have it trasnlated to english (the javascript and  related docs) because I'm more than worried with the situation also  here in Spain (I'm also even under police investigation due [not  directly but mostly] to my relation with tor).
Funny Spanish people is happy because they'll have an Electronic ID  card (containing biometric data about them).... but damn cool ! it's  ELECTRONIC !!!!
Screw it, if somebody translates it to Spanish, please, keep it  simple. I'm not happy about that, I'm Spanish.
