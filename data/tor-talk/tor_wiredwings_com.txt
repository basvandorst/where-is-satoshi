@_subject: Legal response to real abuse 
The Tor website provides pretty good legal information and references in regard to DMCA complaints (to supposedly ease the communication with the ISP). I had to limit our exit policy for the US node anyway, so the only complaints my ISP is receiving now are worse cases, ie. actual abuse: Hacking, spamming, defacements, you name it. Today for example, an individual contacted my ISP about his (successfully) hacked email account using one of our Tor exit nodes.
I know that this is probably a hard question, but are there any paragraphs in US law I can quote to make my ISP feel more comfortable about that? And me? :)

For your ISP, that's probably exactly their rationale.
The problem is that individual blocking doesn't help against the real issue here:
"This is considered the first strike of three -- the third resulting in the termination of your account."

It is not so much that they are incorrect. What is incorrect is to force the takedown of Tor exit nodes because of - in comparison - little abuse. And after all the Tor relays are not the origin of the infringement and actually protected by the DMCA (512a). Still, upstream ISP don't care much and want the complaints to cease.
In that sense, the takedown requests *are* incorrect.
You cannot "exclude p2p" if as with Tor exits policy is port based. Bittorrent (which is the main culprit here) uses port 80 (or 443 for SSL) for tracker connections, and random ports for actual transfer.
If you cut of tracker connections (by blacklisting them), abuse stops. If you stop the actual transfers from happening, abuse stops, too. Both MediaSentry and BayTSP refer to the infringement including the port that the data was offered on.

The main difference here is that most programs try to install to Program
Files, which requires administrative privileges for the benefit of
protection against later tampering. Firefox extensions (by default) end
up in the users home directory.
I am not sure if it actually does, but the Tor installer should be able
to install and run as user just fine, once you point it to a location
where you can actually write to.

@_subject: Automated threat messages force limitation of Exit Policy (Softlayer) 
After running our 300MBit/s Tor node for less than a week, the US data
center Softlayer has forced me to limit our exit policy to well-known
ports after receiving 25 automated Torrent DMCA complaints this weekend
and again more than 20 in the last two days. I hope that now that the
policy is restricted they will allow the node to stay up.
All these complaints list pretty much the same Torrents, have been
issued by MediaSentry or BayTSP, and each offers to get back to them on
changing email addresses and through a web form. For each single abuse
case, I have tried to reach them to tell them about the node and its
background, including the offer to block on IP/Port basis and the URL to
EFF's legal page, but they didn't get back to me and didn't stop the
spamming. I even filed a counter notification with written signature etc.
It's frightening to see how easy it is to effectively shut down any
server at large ISPs such as Softlayer by just repeatedly sending the
same - possibly unjustified - complaints.
If you know of any Tor-friendly ISPs with large bandwidth plans, please
let me know.

@_date: 2010-06-23 12:49:26

At the moment, I allow ports 20-22,53,79-81,110,143,443,706,873,993,
995,8008,8080,8888. Feel free to suggest others.
For each mail passed on to me, I also answered to 100TB.com so they
could close their ticket and pass that information on to Softlayer. In
every mail, I told them that I am sorry for so many automated complaints
coming in, that they should not turn my server off because of these
'spam' mails, and that it would be great to SWIP my IP range. No replies.
Too bad. I am willing to step in, but I am not located in the US, which
seems to be a requirement.
I am not so sure, as they didn't react to anything I passed on to them
regarding my legal status. I am now trying again to get them to SWIP an
IP range for me.

I'm not sure it was the most clever thing to do, but I wanted to have

counter notification doesn't meet the legal requirements...

@_subject: Automated threat messages force limitation of Exit Policy (Softlayer) 
Thanks. After having read more about it, I doubt that I have to file a
counter notification after all. I told them so two days ago, citing the
relevant sections from DMCA, and haven't heard back from them since.
Midphase (100tb) finally told me they were able to SWIP my range, one
day before Softlayer (their data center) told me it wasn't possible. The
range is still not SWIPed though, Midphase said they would look into it
So far, Softlayer shows no sign of understanding anything I've told
them, neither about DMCA law (with the appropriate paragraphs and the
EFF response cited), nor about Tor not being some file sharing utility,
nor about that SWIPing would help on the abuse. Midphase on the other
hand doesn't interfere, I guess they want no trouble with Softlayer but
understand and respect what I'm doing.
Since changing the exit policy, the only reports I've been getting were
some by SpamCop, and two complaints by BayTSP/MediaSentry with old
timestamps. There seems to be a (small) number of spam senders that use
Tor in combination with webmail, but there isn't much I can do about
that (always different destination IPs). Fortunately SpamCop was able to
change their records of my IP range to my contact address so that's not
a big problem.
I'm not sure if I'm legally allowed to publish the complaints. I want to
put them on my blog when I have some time.
The exit policy helps to cool down the situation with Softlayer, and
I'll try my best to make them understand what it is I'm running. When
and if the IP range is SWIPed, we can think about unblocking unknown
ports again.
The average speed is 26 MB/s at the moment. I'm not sure what limits the
speed, the server should be on a Gbit line, and our plan covers 39MB/s...

It does. There are still some old complaints by MediaSentry and BayTSP being forwarded, but the timestamp clearly show dates before I changed exit policy.

@_subject: Hidden Services Hosting and DMCA 
We are currently having a discussion over at torservers.net on whether
it is wise to offer hidden service hosting.
Most people don't have a server, they use free email or pay for cheap
webhosting. The barrier to create hidden services is quite high. I feel
that the Tor network could definitely use an ISP who offers hidden
services hosting. My idea was to use a separate, disk encrypted virtual
machine for hosting hidden services, and only open it towards the Tor
network. Regular, non-anonymous donators should then be able to open
their files towards the Internet, too.
Thank you. You're right, this has to be investigated further. I don't
think that hosting content - on a logically different machine -
influences the forwarding argument for the Tor nodes.
Also, I don't see how it is "quite easy" for authorities to
differentiate between middle node traffic and hidden services - that's
what they are there for after all.
Then it will still apply for the IP addresses of the nodes.
The Tor machine will be clean. If I rent a virtual machine, I also don't
know what happens on other VMs, and this is how I interpret this.
I'm not even so sure if DMCA applies for me, a German hoster offering
services, even when using US servers. Internet law isn't easy.

Hi Mike,
Thanks for your valuable input. What you are saying implicates that
there might be forces interested in investigating what I am hosting. In
a way, you need to compare it to any ISP hosting illegal content without
knowledge. In the case of hidden services it might be harder to
determine the ISP, in the Internet today it is trivial. Regardless of
that, in the end I am just an ISP. If they put so much work in finding
the source, and the source turns out to be me - as in an ISP -, what
else is there to do other than contacting me? I will do everything I can
to shut down illegal services, not only because I am forced to by law,
but because I feel it is the right thing to do. The hosters I deal with
all agreed to forward abuse to me based on DCMA (or the appropriate
country specific equivalent), and I approached them with a commercial
partnership background.
If I were to defend the idea, I could say that if you tried to find the
source of a hidden service, personal servers with worse/less regular
uptime on a residential line would be much easier to track down.
Sad as it is, if that's what it takes, I'm up to it. My education spans
carefully crafted rights, and if these rights are no longer guaranteed,
I will, I want to, stand up for them. I will never *ignore* any orders,
but I will carefully examine the legal basis of the inquiry. I've been
maintaining a fairly high bandwidth Tor exit for years now, and I know
how to deal with abuse. The worst thing that happened was a murder case
investigation, but it was no problem to clear it up without any
interruptions of my Tor node.
I have contacted enough cooperating ISPs outside the US if that turns
out to be necessary (and I hope to find more through this project). This
specific server at Softlayer is paid for on a monthly basis. I will not
provide decryption keys, and luckily I am not forced to do so. If I
were, I would not consider doing this. I have closely looked at
(somewhat) related incidents in Germany, and all charges have been
dropped for lack of evidence if the respective disks were encrypted, in
all cases.
I feel that this discussion is on the brink of something off topic, but
the implications are something that definitely need to be clarified in
any case, no matter how I decide.
Speaking to the list: I understand that most of you are skeptical about
this venture, and you have all the right to be. You should be. But don't
just give up one me, tell me about it. Especially with the current
political situation, I see a market around Tor, and you should not
misconceive that. Commerce is not all bad.

Scott, I don't know why, but you probably didn't get their response in
the first place.
Organization: PP Internet Services
Hello, Scott!
We are a non-profit work association which provides privacy services and
which donates a certain amount of the bandwidth of everyone of its
servers to the TOR network.
Our setup is currently as such, as that all servers which are located in
a specific data center or country, are grouped together in one family.
This has, above all, practical reasons, because we are already operating
45+ servers world-wide.  Additional servers are added on a frequent
basis; at times servers are also removed from our park, either because
we don't like the server's performance or because the data center
doesn't like the privacy services we are providing (and the abuse level
they create) and terminates a contract.
Grouping all servers into one family would, while being ideal, cause at
the moment a disproportional maintenance effort.  We would have to edit
and change the torrc files on 45+ machines whenever a server is added,
renamed or removed.  Currently, we only have one server in most data
centers, and where we have more than one it's usually not more than 2 to
5, so the effort to update the torrc files if another server should be
added to a specific data center is still quite manageable.
However, we naturally do understand your position.
Please consider this a temporary solution until we had the time to come
around to develop and to install scripts on all servers which will
enable use to propagate the "MyFamily" entry centrally to all TOR
servers in our park.  Whenever a TOR server is added or removed, the
scripts on the individual servers could then recreate updated torrc
files, using the centrally propagated "MyFamily" entry, reloading the
new torrc configuration at the same time.
This would solve the problem of cumbersomely manually updating a
steadily growing number of 45+ torrc files on 45+ different servers
whenever a server is added, renamed or removed from our park, just in
order to have the correct "MyFamily" entry in all of them.
Actually, thinking about it, if the TOR configuration file does support
a command like "Include" which would permit TOR to read configuration
entries from another file (a file which contains the "My Family" entry
and which we can centrally propagate to all servers with scp), a
solution to this problem could be implemented much quicker.  I don't
have the list of TOR commands in my head and will have to look up if
such a possibility exists...
In any way, we will take care of this issue as soon as our time permits.
We are planning to rewrite the torrc files anyway, making use of the
DirPortFrontPage command to display a disclaimer on port 80.  Maybe the
one effort can be combined with the other.
All the best,
Perfect Privacy Administration
soon on

Tortunnel is not a separate network, but (ab)uses existing Tor exits. My
guess would be that tortunnel users - client only - don't think a lot
about adding exit relays to Tor. It's not developed any longer, and I
don't think many are using it anyway.
I agree with Stephen that it's not "per se" a threat to the Tor network.

musn't be used in a circuit together with other members of that family,
no more, no less.
So, by misconfiguring the family on my side, I cannot hurt the network
more than (in the extreme) by running no node at all.

Yes, I have used the Tor logo in several places. For one, I am not a graphics designer. Secondly, I think my usage (it its context) is neither "deceptive" nor misleading. Actually, I want to provide Tor services after all.
When you look around, you will see a lot of people and companies using logos of products they do not own or are associated with. For example, you will often see the Microsoft logo in places where Microsoft products are sold.
Let's look at what the Tor website has to say about its logo:
"If you're making non-commercial use of Tor software, you may also use the Tor onion logo (as an illustration, not as a brand for your products). Please don't modify the design or colors of the logo. You can use items that look like the Tor onion logo to illustrate a point (e.g. an exploded onion with layers, for instance), so long as they're not used as logos in ways that would confuse people."
I have also tried to contact the Tor developers through this mailing list about my planned usage, but I guess I should do that more explicitly, and will do that now in a mail to execdir. Sorry. It is very important to me to do this with approval of the Tor community (that's why "it started here").
See below on why I see my current usage as "non-commercial".
 > all donations being used to cover costs (no profit)
I don't see "commercial" as bad per se. I don't see how I am competing with anyone, and if I did (if there was anyone else offering Tor services), that would be "useful" competition after all.
Let me clear with this: I am a student, willing to put my time and effort into running Tor nodes (and more). Depending on what "products" I am building here - which is something that I hope to have designed in a "community effort" (hence the mailing list) - I might *some day* consider to make some small amount of "management fee". At the moment, this is not part of the plan.
The website is not clear about this yet, but I want to distinguish between node sponsorship and donations.
Node sponsorship is "a product you can buy", like you can buy managed and unmanaged servers. These are recurring payments with a contract, towards one or more specific services. I will not collect sponsorship money until we - everyone who is interested in funding a node in some way or another - have decided on a specific configuration, setup and server, which will then be ordered.
Donations on the other hand are irregular, nonrecurring payments. At the moment I agree that this looks like a "primary service" on torservers.net, but I really see it as something very optional - I just haven't worked on the other parts of the "Plans" page yet. I will add a section that one could also want to donate to the Tor project instead to fund development.
Donations will be collected, amounts published, and once some node can be funded from them, used. One pragmatic approach to this would be to bill the regular node sponsors less in one month to make up for these irregular donations.
I already have several people interested in funding a node, and even if I cannot find enough to fund a big node, there's always a small one we can add.

Hi Mike,
Thank you for your input. I agree with all you say, and to some degree it shows that it is yet unclear (from the site) what exactly I want to offer. I now think it might have been better to not make it public before getting that message transported, but I haven't published it anywhere outside of the Tor community lists yet.
I want to have clear statements about WHAT you get for funding a node, and what monthly amount is left to cover before (!) a new node will be set up. Nobody will be billed before that node is ordered. Irregular donations really are something extra. At the moment, they come across to prominent because there are no "product plans" yet.
I am all open for suggestions, I will outline my ideas in a wiki-like, open discussion, together with "early adopters" on the mailing list, until there are specific "products" to offer. That's why I called the section "Plans" after all.
What I really need to attract is people who decide that they want to *own* (parts of) a Tor node, and are willing to pay a monthly fee for it.

Hi Andrew,
Yes, you're right. I'm not exactly the best person to do this (not a native speaker), but I've revised the index page to make it more clear (and moved the old index page to an "intro" page). I could use some graphics or a video, but the only "non-techy" video explaining onion routing I found is a clip from the US series Numb3rs and not exactly the most concise:  :-]
At the moment we're discussing possibly free hidden services/eepsite hosting on the torservers mailinglist.
A "themometer" definitely needs to be there. I'm thinking about a model like "1TB per Euro" and a slider so users can set their own level of participation. Customizations like an own node name, contact information and DNS name "cost extra".
Progress is somewhat slow because I only can work on it in my spare time.
Thanks for your feedback and your "approval"! :-)

At the moment, 25% of all traffic exits through Blutmagie (thanks
Olaf!). I guess we all agree that this situation is far from optimal.
Judging from the number of requests in the last months where people
were looking for friendly ISPs, help with setting up, running and
managing Tor nodes, and especially abuse handling advice, I think there
is enough interest to fund another big node.
I've been in contact with several ISPs lately, asking specifically for
high bandwidth Tor exit node hosting. I have also added their responses
to the GoodBadISPs wiki.
What I am planning is either a large node (split like Blutmagie), if I
can find enough people to sponsor it, and/or smaller nodes on virtual
machines, eg. for hidden services hosting. I will personally order the
machine, manage it, keep Tor(s) running with mostly unrestricted exit
policies and handle all abuse. The companies selected will not shut
down the serve but pass all abuse to me, WHOIS notices will be adjusted
when possible (unfortunately, only a few of them offered that), RDNS
and notice pages will be set up accordingly.
I know that this is a controversial topic, and that it would be better
to have completely independent nodes, but I hope that I can earn your
trust. I will happily sign an agreement that I will not log/sniff
traffic. :-) The configuration will be published among sponsors.
I am open to suggestions here: You as a sponsor might also be
interested in an additional private VPN service, or use the large drive
space as backup purposes, I2P etc. You can of course also be mentioned on
the notice page as sponsor, complete with your company logo.
If you're interested, feel free to contact me directly. Tell me what
you'd want to give, and what you'd expect for your money.
At the moment, I am thinking about something like these (monthly):
 $200 100TB     -  $160 100Mbit/s -  50?  10Mbit/s  - All depending on how many people are willing to participate.

I was asked by mail if I was interested in $5 a month. To make that one
clear: Yes, I am! I want to fund a node. Depending on the number of
people, amounts of money, wishes for services, I will try to find the
best suitable hoster. The three posted were just examples of what I have
in mind. Just contact me, I'll add you to the list, and keep you posted.
I understand that it is far from ideal. Still, one has to be practical.
Currently, one machine is responsible for 25% of exit traffic. Of
course, a large number of smaller nodes with good (unrestricted) exit
policy would be best, but why don't we have them already then ..?
Apart from Mike Perrys arguments, I'd like you to see me as an ISP,
offering independent VPS for Tor hosting, with an additional "Tor
friendly" abuse handling. All I can do is promise (and put it in the
contract) that I will not monitor the traffic. Then you're better off
than with most ISPs out there that shut you down for running Tor or even
demand 200 Euro for forwarding one abuse message.
If I was the first ISP to offer small VPS, preconfigured Tor exit nodes
with root access for customization, then it's a small step towards
saying that at the same time, I can put all efforts into one bigger node
I mean, what is better, one ISP that explicitly allows Tor, handles
abuse, and encrypts the drives, or an ISP that shuts down your virtual
server the first time it gets a complaint and maybe monitors your
traffic? Strato, the second largest hoster in Europe, once called the
police on one of their dedicated servers, because they suspected
criminal behavior, by watching the traffic - on their own initiative. I
can never make sure that the traffic isn't logged upstream. Also, most
ISPs offering VPS are not very explicit about the configuration of their
virtual machines, you have to try and see if Tor works first. I will
make sure that it does.
If you look at bandwidth and hardware prices, once you rent servers,
additional bandwidth is cheap. Example: At FDCServers, you get a
dedicated machine with 10mbit/s for $50, 100mbit/s (and better hardware)
for $160, and 1000mbit/s for $500. I don't aim for the Gigabit, but
10mbit/s is just not economically worthwhile.
Indeed. I am neither US citizen, nor do I plan to (only) accept Amazon
Payments. I see PayPal as one alternative, yes, but in the end it
depends on where the people who would like to fund a node live. I am
German, EU payments can be made without any fees to my bank account.
For organizing payments, I am currently looking into billing software,
but haven't been able to find something that suits my needs. I don't
have a problem organizing monthly mass email for 20 people ("please, pay
your fee, by your payment processor of choice among the following...").
I would also like theoretically to accept anonymous donations for a node
(not for the VPN/webspace stuff of course), but the problem there is not
so much accepting it (PSC, Ukash, Liberty Reserve etc), but making sure
that the money comes in regularly to fund the node.
Before working on the details, I want to make sure there is actual
interest in such a node.
You have to open to a world of people who see the good in Tor, but
either don't have the time or the knowledge to run an own exit.

If you look closely, at the bottom of the page a pie says what the money
is used for.
Basically, torproject donations are used for development. It might not
even be too good to have the same people run nodes. I think it's
important that development gets funded. The German Chaos Computer Club
and the German Privacy foundation, to name only two, also accept
donations towards running Tor nodes.
I have something different in mind than just accepting donations for
nodes. The node website could list its owners, with a small bio and why
they are doing it. And like I said you can use parts of the machine for
different purposes (VPN, Webserver, ...).
Martin Fick:
I first planned to offer a certain bandwidth push for one-time
donations, eg. 1Mbit/s for one month for 2 Euro. The system could be
automated to automatically update the Tor node configuration. Still,
this doesn't solve the problem that there is no hoster that supports to
buy small amounts of bandwidth for just one month. The only thing that
comes pretty close are cloud hosters like Amazon, but the bandwidth and
constant workload isn't very cheap.
What I can offer of course is to collect donations, until they can be
turned into a useful node. For example, anonymous/non-recurring
donations could be distributed evenly amongst the recurring payers
("node sponsors").
For torproject.org , I suggest to accept UKash, PaysafeCard, Liberty
Reserve and maybe another credit card processor (Paypal doesn't allow
prepaid and virtual CCs) in addition to privacy-unfriendly Paypal.
