@_subject: [tor-talk] GNU/Linux Tor Bundle Co-Running Firefox 
Under a Windows platform, I noticed the Tor Bundle is able to run at
the same time with a installed Firefox browser, the former process is
named as "tbb-browser".
Under GNU/Linux, I noticed the Tor Bundle was not renamed, ie. it is
just called "firefox". Would I be able to run concurrently both
browsers without any security compromise?
