So far, no problems.
You probably didn't add the /thisdir/lib to your dynamic linker's
path.  (Just running "make install" for libevent doesn't automagically
add it to the system's default libraries.)
Read your dynamic linker's documentation on how to add such paths.
With OpenBSD, you usually add the library path to the shlib_dirs= line
in /etc/rc.conf.local.
But is there any reason you don't simply use the net/tor port?  This
will save you all these headaches...

Indeed, this port is only for recent OpenBSD versions (3.7 and higher,
it seems).  I would advise you to upgrade your OpenBSD to at least
3.8, since you're using an almost unsupported version.  If that's not
possible, you are on your own...

@_subject: TorCP won't start without mfc70.dll 
Create an empty file called "torcp.exe.local" in the same directory as
torcp.exe, and then put your mfc70.dll file next to it.  You might
also need msvcr70.dll, btw.
I'm not sure who created torcp.exe, but whoever did it, might consider
statically linking the executable.  Windows has always been famous for
its DLL hell...

@_subject: TOR in Java? 
You obviously never ran any reasonably busy Tor server.  Java is way
too slow and memory hogging for this kind of thing.
And as for the buffer overflows, all the nasty crypto stuff that most
CPU time is spent upon is implemented in the Java runtime in... you
can guess. ;)
It's some kind of stupid myth that Java will save you from all
security problems.  Please don't spread it.  Security problems are
caused by sloppy programmers, nothing else.

Do you expect us to be mind-readers?  Where is your actual batch file,
did you forget to post it?
