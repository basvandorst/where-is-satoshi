@_subject: Cannot retrieve apt key from keyserver 
I'm on Ubuntu 10.04 and I try to install tor following
 (Option 2).
I try to add the following repository:
deb      lucid main
When I type in the terminal the following line:
gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv 886DDD89
I get an error telling me the key hasn't been found. I tried to retrieve the key
from  The key isn't found.
How can I install apt repository without this key ? Is there another way to
retrieve the key ?
