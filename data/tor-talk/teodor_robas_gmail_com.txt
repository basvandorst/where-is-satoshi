@_subject: How to deal with OS hibernation 
Hello everybody,
I regularly use tuxonice kernel hibernation. Recently I installed tor and configured as
bridge and exit point. I want to know how it is best to use tor in this Looking in the notices.log I found this warnings:
"[warn] Your system clock just jumped 31831 seconds forward; assuming circuits no longer work". So I wrote a small script that sends SIGTERM (15) when going
into system hibernation. Tor is then restarted at system restore.
What is the recommended way to deal with hibernation ? It seems hard to find information
about this because of the confusion between "tor hibernation" and "system hibernation".

Yes, I run Tor on a laptop. It usually runs about 10 hours/day.
I would like to choose the configuration that is less disruptive at
this usage pattern.

I would say it is still possible to run it, but at low speed ... you know, fly below the radar.

@_subject: copyright abuse through tor 
I think *they* will have to prove that that material was downloaded by *you* and you have it. That is so because you can defend (excuse) yourself anytime with: "somebody else used my wireless connection" or "my computer was infected and somebody else used my computer without my knowledge or consent".
Of course there is a difference between using tor and having a trojan: you were knowingly put your connection to somebody else use. But this should not incriminate you for the downloaded content in any reasonable legal system. And as far as I know (correct me if I am wrong) there is no law in EU to restrict giving bandwidth to somebody else, even when you do not know that "somebody else".
I know there are talks to introduce legal restrictions for providing proxy services to unknown persons in the same way as legally forbidding the act of borrowing a car to a drunk or unknown or incapable of driving Until now, it only looks like they might want to make some money by scarring or intimidating you. Be strong and do not give up your rights.

@_subject: white-listed exit rules 
I ran tor for a while and I noticed (in the apache and named logs) that there is quite a lot of torrent traffic. While I would have nothing against torrent and other sharing protocols (I think about the case of student campuses with very restrictive rules), still I have limited bandwidth to offer. And I would like that bandwidth to be better put to So I would like to run tor on a white list basis. I would like to know if anybody can share such a list - for news, social networks, forums, irc, im - suited for tor ?

@_subject: Help Iranian dissidents by collecting and posting Bridge  
This news was on slashdot not long ago:
Notice that a link was presented to instructions on how to set up
squid based proxy servers.
That may be the reason why the proxy technique got in the media but I
do not know why tor was not mentioned at all.
Thunderbird never asked me a second time for my smtp password until I
wanted to send this message, I thing I will go suspicious.

@_subject: accessing freenode from an IP address that ran tor 
I need some advice with this situation: I can not get access to freenode irc servers. It says that tor exit nodes are banned, even if I stopped tor two days ago. Now I have mailed to them the PGP encrypted nick and password hash and so on.
What I want to know is: do I need to run tor everytime I want freenode access ? Because I just want to connect directly.
And a second question: Does anybody have knowledge it those ip adresses ever get unbanned ?
