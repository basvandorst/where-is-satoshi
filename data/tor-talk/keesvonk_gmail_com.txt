I have long since given up on ZoneAlarm, they are not interested in
bug/crash reports from FreeZoneAlarm users. I am now using Comodo
firewall, with was the only decent alternative I could find, and am very
happy with it.

Does Tor keep a note of the different circuits it chooses? I am
interested in seeing what entry and exit nodes are being used over a
period of time.

Hmmm, I forgot about that. So I should have asked: "Is there a way to
make tor log the circuits it uses (or maybe a way for a local script to
periodically ask tor about the circuit)?"

This reminded me of question I was toying with the other day: If the
exit node of a circuit was in the same country as the computer of
origin, it would seemingly be relatively easy to match traffic send to
the circuit entry node with the traffic emerging from the exit node (I
realise that the amount of traffic would still make this very hard). Is
it therefore possible to exclude exit nodes in certain countries?

@_subject: Tor crashes ZoneAlarm 
I have recently installed the latest vidalia-tor-privoxy bundle from the
tor.eff.org website (vidalia-bundle-0.1.1.23-0.0.7.exe). And it keep
crashing ZoneAlarm (vmon.exe).
I can easily repoduce it:
1. Make sure that tor + vidalia are running.
2. Start Thunderbird (with Tor-button extension)
3. Check you email (will time out first time and crash ZoneAlarm,
usually second or third time).
My ZoneAlarm version is: version 6.5.731.
I have now tested this on four different machines, running XP-Pro (with
and without SP2) or W2K, and all exhibit the same behaviour. Does anyone
know what is going wrong and how I can avoid this?
Thank you very much,

I am using IPCop for that, but that does not give me the control over
which programs can access the internet, so I prefer to use both.

That would still not stop malicious software from accessing the
internet. I mean personally I run linux, so it is not an issue, but most
of my friends run windows, and to stop them having to call on me all the
time I prefer their machines to have as much security as possible. They
all know now how ZoneAlarm works and know when to ask me about strange
processes trying to access the internet. Sounds like an overkill, but
just the other day I had a friend with trojan that had just been
discovered two days earlier and his antivirus was three days old, so
thanks to ZoneAlarm it was stopped from doing to much damage.
I know this is now off topic, but I thought I better explain what I am
looking for.
BTW. can you flash linux onto most routers? I have a D-Link DI-504.

@_subject: Problem: Enigmail Thunderbird Extension & Tor 
I often find that my first few attempts to use Tor time out. I seems
that Tor needs some time to build up its initial connection, after that
it works fine. Give it half a minute to a minute and try it again.
Usually works for me.

@_subject: Torbutton 1.1.6-alpha 
Happens every single time, at least with the janusvm link.
Disabling NoScript does fix the problem, however it still did not use
Tor (according to janusvm.peertech.org). I had to disable FoxyProxy to
get Tor to work.
I normally make heavy use of those two extensions (when not using Tor),
does this mean I can't have Tor button and these two installed at the
same time?

@_subject: Torbutton 1.1.6-alpha 
I just installed torbutton 1.1.6, restarted firefox (2.0.0.5 on
Kubuntu). Clicked on 'Tor Disabled', which changed to 'Tor Enabled'.
Then went to janusvm.peertech.org (which told me I was not using Tor),
then hit the back button and got a dialogue box with said: "False doc
hooking. Please report bug+website!" (my initial page was:
file:///usr/share/ubuntu-artwork/home/index.html). After that I seem to
get that error on every page, even when just switching tabs (just opened
the above URL in a second tab).
Just closed firefox and clicked on the above URL to restart firefox, it
restarts with 'Tor Enabled', but no error. Then opened an new empty tab,
and then switch back to the initial one and straight away get the error
again. (Toggling Tor to disabled stops this behaviour, enabling it again
starts it again.)
Also when I look at my extensions they don't seem to be disabled. I am
using the following extensions:
Adblock Filterset.G Updater - 0.3.1.0
Adblock Plus - 0.7.5.1
CookieSafe - 2.0.6
Fasterfox - 2.0.0
Forecastfox - 0.9.5.2

@_subject: pop3 and smtp over ssh 
I would like to connect to a pop3 and smtp server over ssh server (ports
995 and 465) via tor, but I seems that a lot of exit nodes do not allow
connections to these ports (even though they are always authenticated).
Is there a way of specifying that I only want exit nodes that allow
these ports. If not, can I create a list of exit nodes that allow these
ports and tell tor to only use the nodes on that list (or the reverse of
course: a list of nodes not allowing these ports and tell tor not to use

Then why do my connections always time out? It is virtually impossible
to send or receive via those two ports via Tor. I am very willing to try
other things, but even with a connection time out of 10 minutes it still
times out. It might eventually find one that works, but if I can test
that before hand, I could limit the exit servers to once that work and
that would save me lot of waiting around.

Just a quick question, which probably shows my ignorance.
I would like to put a Tor hidden service on a VM in a IPCop DMZ, do I
have to open any incoming ports on the firewall? (It is not running as a
relay or exit because of the bandwidth limitations of my friend who is
providing me this service.)

So if I understand this correctly you could say that Tor builds circuits for ports, not for sites? If that is correct, can I tell Tor to prebuild a circuit for a certain port?

@_subject: Vista and Thunderbird 
I had a problem with a friends new Vista machine yesterday. When trying
to check email via Tor the connection failed instantly, not like the
normal time out messages you get from time to time. Firefox was working
fine though.
The way I managed to 'fix' it, eventually, is by uninstalling Tor button
and manually input the proxy setting, but instead of 'localhost' I had
to use '127.0.0.1'. The only possible reason I could find for this was
that in the command line 'localhost' resolves to the IPV6 address :::1
instead of the IPV4 address 127.0.0.1, I am not 100% sure if this is the
problem, but if anyone could shine some light on it, please let me know.

@_subject: Prebuilding circuits? 
I have found that while using Tor the first connection to a site always times out. As I understand it, this is because Tor is still building a circuit to the site in question. Now there are certain sites I access a lot, and it would be good if I could tell Tor to build a circuit to the site at start up time, that way I would always have an available circuit.
Can someone please tell me if and how this is possible. If I have totally misunderstood what is going on, please let me know as well.

It is an encrypted site on a none standard port, would that make a That seems to improve things a little, but how bad would this trade off be (I mean what percentage of Tor servers would be ignored because of this).

@_subject: Tor Problems on Korean Windows 
I recently installed tor on the windows machine of a Korean friend and it did not want to work. After a lot of messing about we worked out the the problem was his Korean user name in the path to the torrc file. Once we moved the torrc file to c:\program files\vidalia\tor and told vidalia we had done that, everything to started working. So it seems that either tor or vidalia chokes on unicode characters in the torrc path. I presume I should log this as a bug somewhere, but I am not entirely sure where.
