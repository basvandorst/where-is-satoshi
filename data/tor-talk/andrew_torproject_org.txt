:      That brings up something that has bothered me for a long time.  When
: tor discovers that its version doesn't match any in either client-versions
: or server-versions, it currently writes complaints about it to the log(s),
: but seems to do nothing further about it.  I'd like to see either of the
: following.
Recently, we're started emailing the node operators (at least those with
valid contact info) suggesting they upgrade to at least 0.2.0.34-stable.
This method seems to have a better success ratio in getting nodes
upgraded from very old versions.  At least, better than the log messages
that state your tor version is not recommended anymore.
We're also working on Tor Weather to enable automatic notifications, such
as "your server is out of date, please upgrade".

In general, these options seem a fine way to partition the tor
network.  Possibly more so for new releases and arbitraging the time
during which clients and relays upgrade. Tor clients already don't
trust the relays. The risk is possibly more to the relay operator than
the tor clients using their relay.  It's their OS in most cases that's
at risk, not so much the Tor network.  An option to allow your client to only select from a list of relays
running a version as agreed by the DA's as recommended seems the better
of your a vs b.
We should stop talking about making the relay trust the client.  I
don't think implementing a DRM scheme serves Tor in any way.  If you
think of Tor like TCP, then the whole discussion gets silly.  Tor is an
anonymizing protocol on top of tcp/ip, for now.  Hidden services and
such are example applications that use Tor, the protocol.
Roger and I have had conversations about this thread in taxis, train
stations, and the like as we've been traveling.  I'm sure he'll comment

@_subject: tor with OpenDNS as default DNS, using Firefox+FoxyProxy 
For the same reason I don't use a 3rd party blacklist for spam
filtering, I don't want my traffic filtered by a tor exit node.  If you
do, great, but don't force it on everyone else.  If my browser is told to ask for google-analytics.com, and your node
blocks it by policy, my tor client will find a new exit node that
allows it.  If you block the access to google-analytics.com after Tor
(such as filtering proxy or blocklist program via IP ranges) then
that's a fine way to get your exit node listed as a "bad exit".  I
suspect traffic from advertising networks is a pittance in comparison
to the peer to peer traffic/bulk data transfer currently overloading
the tor network.  Tor isn't trying to defeat any one business model,
but provide users the ability to control their information to some
degree when using the Internet.  I use tor to protect my privacy and anonymity online.  I want it
to do nothing more.  Let me decide, as the user, what gets
requested, denied, or allowed into my Internet experience.  It's the
user's choice if they want to subscribe to a list of what one person (or
organization) thinks is good or bad on the Internet, but most don't want
it pushed on them without a choice.
I use a firefox extension called Request Policy to not grab different
domains than the one I'm requesting, many of which happen to be
click-tracking and advertising networks.  For now, coupled with
torbutton, this is all I need.  If there was a way to set the "evil bit" in TCP, I'd like the option to
honor it or not; regardless of how many people tell me honoring it
would solve all crimes, cure diseases, and create world peace.

Vidalia can be downloaded at     * Add a "Find Bridges Now" button that will attempt to automatically
      download a set of bridge addresses and add them to the list of
bridges in the Network settings page.
    * Add support for building with Google's Breakpad crash reporting
      library (currently disabled by default).
    * Show or hide the "Who has used my bridge recently?" link along
with the other bridge-related widgets when the user toggles the relay
mode in the Network settings page. (Ticket     * Tolerate bridge addresses that do not specify a port number, since
Tor now defaults to using port 443 in such cases.
    * Add support for viewing the map as a full screen widget when built
      with KDE Marble support.
    * Compute the salted hash of the control password ourself when
starting Tor, rather than launching Tor once to hash the password,
parsing the output, and then again to actually start Tor.
    * Add a signal handler that allows Vidalia to clean up and exit
normally when it catches a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal. (Ticket     * If the user chooses to ignore further warnings for a particular
port, remove it from the WarnPlaintextPorts and RejectPlaintextPorts
      settings immediately. Also remember their preferences and reapply
them later, even if Tor is unable to writes to its torrc.(Ticket     * Don't display additional plaintext port warning message boxes
until the first visible message box is dismissed. (Ticket     * Renamed the 'make win32-installer' CMake target to 'make
dist-win32' for consistency with our 'make dist-osx' target.
    * Fix a couple bugs in the WiX-based Windows installer related to
building a Marble-enabled Vidalia installer.
    * Write the list of source files containing translatable strings to
a .pro file and supply just the .pro file as an argument to lupdate,

> There's this tor browser bundle that I guess is supposed to make it
The point of the Tor Browser Bundle is to provide a pre-configured
bundle of software to provide anonymous browser without any
configuration.  There's nothing to set up, it's already done for you.
We encourage people to use the TBB for their privacy and anonymity
online, and their normal browser for whatever else they do online.
We make an installable bundle that doesn't contain Firefox and is
configured to use Vidalia (the controller) to manage Tor. But then you
have to configure your apps to use localhost:9050 as a SOCKS proxy.
We chose Firefox because we can view the source and figure out all the
ways to protect anonymity and privacy online.  Opera nor IE are open
source, so we'd waste a colossal amount of time (and money) reverse
engineering the software with IDA Pro or something similar.
If Opera supports SOCKS 4a or 5, then point Opera at Tor on

There is an issue for some people using a clean Windows XP, Vista, 7

or compile OpenSSL ourselves with Visual C. The symptoms were the "find
bridges now" button didn't appear in Vidalia 0.2.x, and the relays would
never get flags. A few people posted comments to this blog about lacking

1) search the Changelog for ipv6:
Tor 0.2.1.5-alpha moves us closer to handling IPv6 destinations, puts
      IPv6 addresses.
    - Generate and accept IPv6 addresses in many protocol elements.
    - Make resolver code handle nameservers located at ipv6 addresses.
    - Try to fix Win32 compilation again: improve checking for IPv6 types.
    - Merge in some (as-yet-unused) IPv6 address manipulation code.
    - Detect and reject DNS replies containing IPv4 or IPv6 records with
    - Fix as-yet-unused reverse IPv6 lookup code so it sends nybbles

What's more likely is an inquiry by law enforcement because your exit

@_subject: Scott made me do it. 
A while ago there was a thread that devolved into "why does Tor still
ship ancient privoxy?" and "why are you shipping polipo with the Tor
Browser Bundle instead of current privoxy?"  For those interested, the
thread is here, Scott had a good argument for why we should update the bundles to the
latest privoxy, and I agree, we should.  But then I started thinking
about why we needed a proxy at all.  Almost all browsers support socks5
direct, isn't that faster than a middleman proxy?
This got me thinking about why we put polipo in the TBB, but not the
other packages.  The TBB "feels faster" when using Tor than using the
installed Tor, Vidalia, and Privoxy.  However, I couldn't find any
actual testing of performance of polipo vs. privoxy vs. socks5 direct.
So I did it myself, in a loose manner.
The raw data from Tamper Data as xml, proxy config files, and results in
a spreadsheet are all contained in
  And yes,
the ruby script is a quick and dirty hack.
I tested a few scenarios:
1) native polipo and privoxy without using Tor.
2) polipo and privoxy forwarding to Tor localhost:9050.
3) firefox socks5 direct to Tor via localhost:9050.
The summary of results:
1) Native polipo is 54.5% faster on average than native privoxy.  This
could be due to polipo's caching, http 1.1 pipelining, and it can serve
bits as fast as they come in from the network.  Privoxy needs to load
the whole page, scan it, and then send it to the client.  Even if
privoxy filtering is disabled, it still works the same way.
2) Polipo caching shines with Tor usage.  Common images are cached, and
served from the memory cache in single-digit millisecond ranges.
Privoxy needs to wait for Tor to wholly deliver the bits.  Caching is
faster, this we know already.  However, from a user perspective, it's
just faster to load pages.
3) socks5 in Firefox 3.5.2 did better than I expected.
4) I tried testing a click to a second page to see how much polipo
caching helps people reading different pages on the same site.  It
helps, but not as much as I expected.
Caveats:  Testing under tor is highly variable.  I used the same
circuits for both the polipo and privoxy tests to minimize variability.
 However, I can't control node load and congestion.
Out of 23 get requests for the Torproject.org/index.html.en, 17 are for
the country flags.   Perhaps we should load these last at the bottom of
the page, or do something else to speed up the torproject page load.
As I was doing this, I kept thinking of other ways to do it better;
1) time requests and bits between tor, the http proxy, and the browser.
 How long does each request take to get from the browser, to the proxy,
to tor and back across each layer?  how much latency does each piece of
software add to the request and delivery?
2) automate testing and let it run on a normal tor client over weeks.
This will average out tor network variability and show "typical" user
3) Pick a sampling of the top 100 websites by visits worldwide and
measure their performance with the three methods, fully instrumented as
in 4) Do user experience measurements.  Pay/ask/bribe people to sit in
front of a computer, video record their browsing and feedback, and ask
for a rating of each configuration (socks5, polipo, privoxy, and a placebo).
5) re-run  and run gcov to watch the code paths used in each piece of
software, and figure out what can be optimized for performance.
6) test various "private browsing modes" through tor to see which
browser is faster; firefox, safari, chromium, torfox, or torora.
7) how can we better tune polipo caching dynamically based on system ram
config?  Does having 1GB of cache provide significant benefits over the
I'm sure there are lots of things wrong with my measurements, minimal
analysis, and results.
Constructive criticism is welcome.

If you look at the tor-polipo.conf file, you'll see disk cache is
disabled.  All of this cache is in ram.
Just to clarify, I don't question the value of privoxy.  In a perfect
world privoxy would have caching, http pipelining, and do filtering.  If
people want to filter their browsing, then by all means they should be
able to do so.  I question the value of shipping a filtering proxy that
is enabled by default.  A growing number of Tor users choose Tor because
it provides un-censored/filtered access to the Internet.  Having the Tor
software filter the Internet by default seems ironic.

I agree there is a gray area here in filtering versus protection.  I
don't have a concrete answer at this point.  A fine question is, Where
is the boundary between protecting the user from an anonymity
vulnerability versus open access to information (for good or bad)?
Torbutton protects against known issues within Firefox, but are ad
networks external to those issues or is it something we need to mitigate
for the user (unsuspecting or otherwise)?
I may sound like a broken record here, but I don't use an ad blocker
plugin.  RequestPolicy does just fine to block 99% of the ads because
99% of the sites on the Internet use a 3rd party ad network that isn't
in their full domain. (I don't actually know if 99% of the sites on the
Internet use a 3rd party ad service, but roughly 99% of the sites I
browse for information appear to do so.)  This also breaks content
delivery networks and turns most sites into text only, but that's fine
with me.
Clearly I need to do more testing and use more features ofprivoxy to see
what it can do.

@_subject: Something that I don't understand about privoxy 
> So here are my questions: First of all, if privoxy is needed for
The Tor Browser Bundle, aka the portable bundle, doesn't include
Privoxy.  It includes Polipo instead.  Polipo and Privoxy serve
different purposes.
Privoxy and Polipo can both filter content at the proxy, before it
reaches your web browser.  In the Tor Browser Bundle, Polipo is
configured without filtering and without disk cache.  Polipo caches
objects in ram, and generally is used to speed up browsing the Internet
via Tor.  We use Polipo as a way to get around the Firefox bugs with
SOCKS proxies.  Using Firefox 3.0 and earlier with Tor directly can be a
very slow experience, due to hard-coded timeouts in Firefox.  Firefox
3.5.x may or may not fix the SOCKS issues enough to let us remove the
http proxy.
People install the Vidalia bundle so they can use their favorite web
browser (for good or for bad) with Tor and Privoxy.  At the time the
Vidalia bundle was created, Opera, IE, Safari, and other browsers lacked
the ability to filter content via plugins.  Privoxy fulfills this role.
 This situation isn't so much the case today, but we continue to ship
Privoxy because no one has come up with a better browser or
configuration.  And Firefox still has bugs with SOCKS proxies.
Torora and TorFox may be the future, where Torbutton's anonymity and
privacy protections are built into the browser; and they are faster at
interfacing with Tor directly.  This removes the need for a http proxy
between the browser and Tor.  However, research and development
continues on both browsers.

There hasn't been research into whether privoxy filtering adds
additional anonymity and privacy protections, at least no research that
I know of.  The real question is possibly whether ad-blockers, or domain
restrictions (such as with request policy plugin for firefox), enhance
your online privacy.  There are logical guesses here, but no

The forthcoming Vidalia 0.2.2 bundle will be either x86 or PPC, not
universal.  This cuts the package size in half.

@_subject: [Fwd: Tor 0.2.1.18 and 0.2.1.19 are released] 
For those who didn't see the announcement, we have a new stable release
based on the 0.2.1.x codebase.
-------- Original Message --------
Tor 0.2.1.18 lays the foundations for performance improvements, adds
status events to help users diagnose bootstrap problems, adds optional
authentication/authorization for hidden services, fixes a variety of
potential anonymity problems, and includes a huge pile of other features
and bug fixes.
Tor 0.2.1.19 fixes a major bug with accessing and providing hidden
Changes in version 0.2.1.19 - 2009-07-28
  o Major bugfixes:
    - Make accessing hidden services on 0.2.1.x work right again.
      Bugfix on 0.2.1.3-alpha; workaround for bug 1038. Diagnosis and
      part of patch provided by "optimist".
  o Minor features:
    - When a relay/bridge is writing out its identity key fingerprint to
      the "fingerprint" file and to its logs, write it without spaces. Now
      it will look like the fingerprints in our bridges documentation,
      and confuse fewer users.
  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Relays no longer publish a new server descriptor if they change
      their MaxAdvertisedBandwidth config option but it doesn't end up
      changing their advertised bandwidth numbers. Bugfix on 0.2.0.28-rc;
      fixes bug 1026. Patch from Sebastian.
    - Avoid leaking memory every time we get a create cell but we have
      so many already queued that we refuse it. Bugfix on 0.2.0.19-alpha;
      fixes bug 1034. Reported by BarkerJr.
Changes in version 0.2.1.18 - 2009-07-24
  o Major features (clients):
    - Start sending "bootstrap phase" status events to the controller,
      so it can keep the user informed of progress fetching directory
      information and establishing circuits. Also inform the controller
      if we think we're stuck at a particular bootstrap phase. Implements
      proposal 137.
    - Clients replace entry guards that were chosen more than a few months
      ago. This change should significantly improve client performance,
      especially once more people upgrade, since relays that have been
      a guard for a long time are currently overloaded.
    - Network status consensus documents and votes now contain bandwidth
      information for each relay. Clients use the bandwidth values
      in the consensus, rather than the bandwidth values in each
      relay descriptor. This approach opens the door to more accurate
      bandwidth estimates once the directory authorities start doing
      active measurements. Implements part of proposal 141.
  o Major features (relays):
    - Disable and refactor some debugging checks that forced a linear scan
      over the whole server-side DNS cache. These accounted for over 50%
      of CPU time on a relatively busy exit node's gprof profile. Also,
      disable some debugging checks that appeared in exit node profile
      data. Found by Jacob.
    - New DirPortFrontPage option that takes an html file and publishes
      it as "/" on the DirPort. Now relay operators can provide a
      disclaimer without needing to set up a separate webserver. There's
      a sample disclaimer in contrib/tor-exit-notice.html.
  o Major features (hidden services):
    - Make it possible to build hidden services that only certain clients
      are allowed to connect to. This is enforced at several points,
      so that unauthorized clients are unable to send INTRODUCE cells
      to the service, or even (depending on the type of authentication)
      to learn introduction points. This feature raises the bar for
      certain kinds of active attacks against hidden services. Design
      and code by Karsten Loesing. Implements proposal 121.
    - Relays now store and serve v2 hidden service descriptors by default,
      i.e., the new default value for HidServDirectoryV2 is 1. This is
      the last step in proposal 114, which aims to make hidden service
      lookups more reliable.
  o Major features (path selection):
    - ExitNodes and Exclude*Nodes config options now allow you to restrict
      by country code ("{US}") or IP address or address pattern
      ("255.128.0.0/16"). Patch from Robert Hogan. It still needs some
      refinement to decide what config options should take priority if
      you ask to both use a particular node and exclude it.
  o Major features (misc):
    - When building a consensus, do not include routers that are down.
      This cuts down 30% to 40% on consensus size. Implements proposal
      138.
    - New TestingTorNetwork config option to allow adjustment of
      previously constant values that could slow bootstrapping. Implements
      proposal 135. Patch from Karsten.
    - Convert many internal address representations to optionally hold
      IPv6 addresses. Generate and accept IPv6 addresses in many protocol
      elements. Make resolver code handle nameservers located at IPv6
      addresses.
    - More work on making our TLS handshake blend in: modify the list
      of ciphers advertised by OpenSSL in client mode to even more
      closely resemble a common web browser. We cheat a little so that
      we can advertise ciphers that the locally installed OpenSSL doesn't
      know about.
    - Use the TLS1 hostname extension to more closely resemble browser
      behavior.
  o Security fixes (anonymity/entropy):
    - Never use a connection with a mismatched address to extend a
      circuit, unless that connection is canonical. A canonical
      connection is one whose address is authenticated by the router's
      identity key, either in a NETINFO cell or in a router descriptor.
    - Implement most of proposal 110: The first K cells to be sent
      along a circuit are marked as special "early" cells; only K "early"
      cells will be allowed. Once this code is universal, we can block
      certain kinds of denial-of-service attack by requiring that EXTEND
      commands must be sent using an "early" cell.
    - Resume using OpenSSL's RAND_poll() for better (and more portable)
      cross-platform entropy collection again. We used to use it, then
      stopped using it because of a bug that could crash systems that
      called RAND_poll when they had a lot of fds open. It looks like the
      bug got fixed in late 2006. Our new behavior is to call RAND_poll()
      at startup, and to call RAND_poll() when we reseed later only if
      we have a non-buggy OpenSSL version.
    - When the client is choosing entry guards, now it selects at most
      one guard from a given relay family. Otherwise we could end up with
      all of our entry points into the network run by the same operator.
      Suggested by Camilo Viecco. Fix on 0.1.1.11-alpha.
    - Do not use or believe expired v3 authority certificates. Patch
      from Karsten. Bugfix in 0.2.0.x. Fixes bug 851.
    - Drop begin cells to a hidden service if they come from the middle
      of a circuit. Patch from lark.
    - When we erroneously receive two EXTEND cells for the same circuit
      ID on the same connection, drop the second. Patch from lark.
    - Authorities now vote for the Stable flag for any router whose
      weighted MTBF is at least 5 days, regardless of the mean MTBF.
    - Clients now never report any stream end reason except 'MISC'.
      Implements proposal 148.
  o Major bugfixes (crashes):
    - Parse dates and IPv4 addresses in a locale- and libc-independent
      manner, to avoid platform-dependent behavior on malformed input.
    - Fix a crash that occurs on exit nodes when a nameserver request
      timed out. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha; our CLEAR debugging code had
      been suppressing the bug since 0.1.2.10-alpha. Partial fix for
      bug 929.
    - Do not assume that a stack-allocated character array will be
      64-bit aligned on platforms that demand that uint64_t access is
      aligned. Possible fix for bug 604.
    - Resolve a very rare crash bug that could occur when the user forced
      a nameserver reconfiguration during the middle of a nameserver
      probe. Fixes bug 526. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha.
    - Avoid a "0 divided by 0" calculation when calculating router uptime
      at directory authorities. Bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha.
    - Fix an assertion bug in parsing policy-related options; possible fix
      for bug 811.
    - Rate-limit too-many-sockets messages: when they happen, they happen
      a lot and end up filling up the disk. Resolves bug 748.
    - Fix a race condition that could cause crashes or memory corruption
      when running as a server with a controller listening for log
      messages.
    - Avoid crashing when we have a policy specified in a DirPolicy or
      SocksPolicy or ReachableAddresses option with ports set on it,
      and we re-load the policy. May fix bug 996.
    - Fix an assertion failure on 64-bit platforms when we allocated
      memory right up to the end of a memarea, then realigned the memory
      one step beyond the end. Fixes a possible cause of bug 930.
    - Protect the count of open sockets with a mutex, so we can't
      corrupt it when two threads are closing or opening sockets at once.
      Fix for bug 939. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.
  o Major bugfixes (clients):
    - Discard router descriptors as we load them if they are more than
      five days old. Otherwise if Tor is off for a long time and then
      starts with cached descriptors, it will try to use the onion keys
      in those obsolete descriptors when building circuits. Fixes bug 887.
    - When we choose to abandon a new entry guard because we think our
      older ones might be better, close any circuits pending on that
      new entry guard connection. This fix should make us recover much
      faster when our network is down and then comes back. Bugfix on
      0.1.2.8-beta; found by lodger.
    - When Tor clients restart after 1-5 days, they discard all their
      cached descriptors as too old, but they still use the cached
      consensus document. This approach is good for robustness, but
      bad for performance: since they don't know any bandwidths, they
      end up choosing at random rather than weighting their choice by
      speed. Fixed by the above feature of putting bandwidths in the
      consensus.
  o Major bugfixes (relays):
    - Relays were falling out of the networkstatus consensus for
      part of a day if they changed their local config but the
      authorities discarded their new descriptor as "not sufficiently
      different". Now directory authorities accept a descriptor as changed
      if BandwidthRate or BandwidthBurst changed. Partial fix for bug 962;
      patch by Sebastian.
    - Ensure that two circuits can never exist on the same connection
      with the same circuit ID, even if one is marked for close. This
      is conceivably a bugfix for bug 779; fixes a bug on 0.1.0.4-rc.
    - Directory authorities were neglecting to mark relays down in their
      internal histories if the relays fall off the routerlist without
      ever being found unreachable. So there were relays in the histories
      that haven't been seen for eight months, and are listed as being
      up for eight months. This wreaked havoc on the "median wfu" and
      "median mtbf" calculations, in turn making Guard and Stable flags
      wrong, hurting network performance. Fixes bugs 696 and 969. Bugfix
      on 0.2.0.6-alpha.
  o Major bugfixes (hidden services):
    - When establishing a hidden service, introduction points that
      originate from cannibalized circuits were completely ignored
      and not included in rendezvous service descriptors. This might
      have been another reason for delay in making a hidden service
      available. Bugfix from long ago (0.0.9.x?)
  o Major bugfixes (memory and resource management):
    - Fixed some memory leaks -- some quite frequent, some almost
      impossible to trigger -- based on results from Coverity.
    - Speed up parsing and cut down on memory fragmentation by using
      stack-style allocations for parsing directory objects. Previously,
      this accounted for over 40% of allocations from within Tor's code
      on a typical directory cache.
    - Use a Bloom filter rather than a digest-based set to track which
      descriptors we need to keep around when we're cleaning out old
      router descriptors. This speeds up the computation significantly,
      and may reduce fragmentation.
  o New/changed config options:
    - Now NodeFamily and MyFamily config options allow spaces in
      identity fingerprints, so it's easier to paste them in.
      Suggested by Lucky Green.
    - Allow ports 465 and 587 in the default exit policy again. We had
      rejected them in 0.1.0.15, because back in 2005 they were commonly
      misconfigured and ended up as spam targets. We hear they are better
      locked down these days.
    - Make TrackHostExit mappings expire a while after their last use, not
      after their creation. Patch from Robert Hogan.
    - Add an ExcludeExitNodes option so users can list a set of nodes
      that should be be excluded from the exit node position, but
      allowed elsewhere. Implements proposal 151.
    - New --hush command-line option similar to --quiet. While --quiet
      disables all logging to the console on startup, --hush limits the
      output to messages of warning and error severity.
    - New configure/torrc options (--enable-geoip-stats,
      DirRecordUsageByCountry) to record how many IPs we've served
      directory info to in each country code, how many status documents
      total we've sent to each country code, and what share of the total
      directory requests we should expect to see.
    - Make outbound DNS packets respect the OutboundBindAddress setting.
      Fixes the bug part of bug 798. Bugfix on 0.1.2.2-alpha.
    - Allow separate log levels to be configured for different logging
      domains. For example, this allows one to log all notices, warnings,
      or errors, plus all memory management messages of level debug or
      higher, with: Log [MM] debug-err [*] notice-err file /var/log/tor.
    - Update to the "June 3 2009" ip-to-country file.
  o Minor features (relays):
    - Raise the minimum rate limiting to be a relay from 20000 bytes
      to 20480 bytes (aka 20KB/s), to match our documentation. Also
      update directory authorities so they always assign the Fast flag
      to relays with 20KB/s of capacity. Now people running relays won't
      suddenly find themselves not seeing any use, if the network gets
      faster on average.
    - If we're a relay and we change our IP address, be more verbose
      about the reason that made us change. Should help track down
      further bugs for relays on dynamic IP addresses.
    - Exit servers can now answer resolve requests for ip6.arpa addresses.
    - Implement most of Proposal 152: allow specialized servers to permit
      single-hop circuits, and clients to use those servers to build
      single-hop circuits when using a specialized controller. Patch
      from Josh Albrecht. Resolves feature request 768.
    - When relays do their initial bandwidth measurement, don't limit
      to just our entry guards for the test circuits. Otherwise we tend
      to have multiple test circuits going through a single entry guard,
      which makes our bandwidth test less accurate. Fixes part of bug 654;
      patch contributed by Josh Albrecht.
  o Minor features (directory authorities):
    - Try not to open more than one descriptor-downloading connection
      to an authority at once. This should reduce load on directory
      authorities. Fixes bug 366.
    - Add cross-certification to newly generated certificates, so that
      a signing key is enough information to look up a certificate. Start
      serving certificates by       pairs. Implements proposal 157.
    - When a directory authority downloads a descriptor that it then
      immediately rejects, do not retry downloading it right away. Should
      save some bandwidth on authorities. Fix for bug 888. Patch by
      Sebastian Hahn.
    - Directory authorities now serve a /tor/dbg-stability.txt URL to
      help debug WFU and MTBF calculations.
    - In directory authorities' approved-routers files, allow
      fingerprints with or without space.
  o Minor features (directory mirrors):
    - When a download gets us zero good descriptors, do not notify
      Tor that new directory information has arrived.
    - Servers support a new URL scheme for consensus downloads that
      allows the client to specify which authorities are trusted.
      The server then only sends the consensus if the client will trust
      it. Otherwise a 404 error is sent back. Clients use this
      new scheme when the server supports it (meaning it's running
      0.2.1.1-alpha or later). Implements proposal 134.
  o Minor features (bridges):
    - If the bridge config line doesn't specify a port, assume 443.
      This makes bridge lines a bit smaller and easier for users to
      understand.
    - If we're using bridges and our network goes away, be more willing
      to forgive our bridges and try again when we get an application
      request.
  o Minor features (hidden services):
    - When the client launches an introduction circuit, retry with a
      new circuit after 30 seconds rather than 60 seconds.
    - Launch a second client-side introduction circuit in parallel
      after a delay of 15 seconds (based on work by Christian Wilms).
    - Hidden services start out building five intro circuits rather
      than three, and when the first three finish they publish a service
      descriptor using those. Now we publish our service descriptor much
      faster after restart.
    - Drop the requirement to have an open dir port for storing and
      serving v2 hidden service descriptors.
  o Minor features (build and packaging):
    - On Linux, use the prctl call to re-enable core dumps when the User
      option is set.
    - Try to make sure that the version of Libevent we're running with
      is binary-compatible with the one we built with. May address bug
      897 and others.
    - Add a new --enable-local-appdata configuration switch to change
      the default location of the datadir on win32 from APPDATA to
      LOCAL_APPDATA. In the future, we should migrate to LOCAL_APPDATA
      entirely. Patch from coderman.
    - Build correctly against versions of OpenSSL 0.9.8 or later that
      are built without support for deprecated functions.
    - On platforms with a maximum syslog string length, truncate syslog
      messages to that length ourselves, rather than relying on the
      system to do it for us.
    - Automatically detect MacOSX versions earlier than 10.4.0, and
      disable kqueue from inside Tor when running with these versions.
      We previously did this from the startup script, but that was no
      help to people who didn't use the startup script. Resolves bug 863.
    - Build correctly when configured to build outside the main source
      path. Patch from Michael Gold.
    - Disable GCC's strict alias optimization by default, to avoid the
      likelihood of its introducing subtle bugs whenever our code violates
      the letter of C99's alias rules.
    - Change the contrib/tor.logrotate script so it makes the new
      logs as "_tor:_tor" rather than the default, which is generally
      "root:wheel". Fixes bug 676, reported by Serge Koksharov.
    - Change our header file guard macros to be less likely to conflict
      with system headers. Adam Langley noticed that we were conflicting
      with log.h on Android.
    - Add a couple of extra warnings to --enable-gcc-warnings for GCC 4.3,
      and stop using a warning that had become unfixably verbose under
      GCC 4.3.
    - Use a lockfile to make sure that two Tor processes are not
      simultaneously running with the same datadir.
    - Allow OpenSSL to use dynamic locks if it wants.
    - Add LIBS=-lrt to Makefile.am so the Tor RPMs use a static libevent.
  o Minor features (controllers):
    - When generating circuit events with verbose nicknames for
      controllers, try harder to look up nicknames for routers on a
      circuit. (Previously, we would look in the router descriptors we had
      for nicknames, but not in the consensus.) Partial fix for bug 941.
    - New controller event NEWCONSENSUS that lists the networkstatus
      lines for every recommended relay. Now controllers like Torflow
      can keep up-to-date on which relays they should be using.
    - New controller event "clients_seen" to report a geoip-based summary
      of which countries we've seen clients from recently. Now controllers
      like Vidalia can show bridge operators that they're actually making
      a difference.
    - Add a 'getinfo status/clients-seen' controller command, in case
      controllers want to hear clients_seen events but connect late.
    - New CONSENSUS_ARRIVED event to note when a new consensus has
      been fetched and validated.
    - Add an internal-use-only __ReloadTorrcOnSIGHUP option for
      controllers to prevent SIGHUP from reloading the configuration.
      Fixes bug 856.
    - Return circuit purposes in response to GETINFO circuit-status.
      Fixes bug 858.
    - Serve the latest v3 networkstatus consensus via the control
      port. Use "getinfo dir/status-vote/current/consensus" to fetch it.
    - Add a "GETINFO /status/bootstrap-phase" controller option, so the
      controller can query our current bootstrap state in case it attaches
      partway through and wants to catch up.
    - Provide circuit purposes along with circuit events to the controller.
  o Minor features (tools):
    - Do not have tor-resolve automatically refuse all .onion addresses;
      if AutomapHostsOnResolve is set in your torrc, this will work fine.
    - Add a -p option to tor-resolve for specifying the SOCKS port: some
      people find host:port too confusing.
    - Print the SOCKS5 error message string as well as the error code
      when a tor-resolve request fails. Patch from Jacob.
  o Minor bugfixes (memory and resource management):
    - Clients no longer cache certificates for authorities they do not
      recognize. Bugfix on 0.2.0.9-alpha.
    - Do not use C's stdio library for writing to log files. This will
      improve logging performance by a minute amount, and will stop
      leaking fds when our disk is full. Fixes bug 861.
    - Stop erroneous use of O_APPEND in cases where we did not in fact
      want to re-seek to the end of a file before every last write().
    - Fix a small alignment and memory-wasting bug on buffer chunks.
      Spotted by rovv.
    - Add a malloc_good_size implementation to OpenBSD_malloc_linux.c,
      to avoid unused RAM in buffer chunks and memory pools.
    - Reduce the default smartlist size from 32 to 16; it turns out that
      most smartlists hold around 8-12 elements tops.
    - Make dumpstats() log the fullness and size of openssl-internal
      buffers.
    - If the user has applied the experimental SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS
      patch to their OpenSSL, turn it on to save memory on servers. This
      patch will (with any luck) get included in a mainline distribution
      before too long.
    - Fix a memory leak when v3 directory authorities load their keys
      and cert from disk. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.
    - Stop using malloc_usable_size() to use more area than we had
      actually allocated: it was safe, but made valgrind really unhappy.
    - Make the assert_circuit_ok() function work correctly on circuits that
      have already been marked for close.
    - Fix uninitialized size field for memory area allocation: may improve
      memory performance during directory parsing.
  o Minor bugfixes (clients):
    - Stop reloading the router list from disk for no reason when we
      run out of reachable directory mirrors. Once upon a time reloading
      it would set the 'is_running' flag back to 1 for them. It hasn't
      done that for a long time.
    - When we had picked an exit node for a connection, but marked it as
      "optional", and it turned out we had no onion key for the exit,
      stop wanting that exit and try again. This situation may not
      be possible now, but will probably become feasible with proposal
      158. Spotted by rovv. Fixes another case of bug 752.
    - Fix a bug in address parsing that was preventing bridges or hidden
      service targets from being at IPv6 addresses.
    - Do not remove routers as too old if we do not have any consensus
      document. Bugfix on 0.2.0.7-alpha.
    - When an exit relay resolves a stream address to a local IP address,
      do not just keep retrying that same exit relay over and
      over. Instead, just close the stream. Addresses bug 872. Bugfix
      on 0.2.0.32. Patch from rovv.
    - Made Tor a little less aggressive about deleting expired
      certificates. Partial fix for bug 854.
    - Treat duplicate certificate fetches as failures, so that we do
      not try to re-fetch an expired certificate over and over and over.
    - Do not say we're fetching a certificate when we'll in fact skip it
      because of a pending download.
    - If we have correct permissions on $datadir, we complain to stdout
      and fail to start. But dangerous permissions on
      $datadir/cached-status/ would cause us to open a log and complain
      there. Now complain to stdout and fail to start in both cases. Fixes
      bug 820, reported by seeess.
  o Minor bugfixes (bridges):
    - When we made bridge authorities stop serving bridge descriptors over
      unencrypted links, we also broke DirPort reachability testing for
      bridges. So bridges with a non-zero DirPort were printing spurious
      warns to their logs. Bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha. Fixes bug 709.
    - Don't allow a bridge to publish its router descriptor to a
      non-bridge directory authority. Fixes part of bug 932.
    - When we change to or from being a bridge, reset our counts of
      client usage by country. Fixes bug 932.
  o Minor bugfixes (relays):
    - Log correct error messages for DNS-related network errors on
      Windows.
    - Actually return -1 in the error case for read_bandwidth_usage().
      Harmless bug, since we currently don't care about the return value
      anywhere. Bugfix on 0.2.0.9-alpha.
    - Provide a more useful log message if bug 977 (related to buffer
      freelists) ever reappears, and do not crash right away.
    - We were already rejecting relay begin cells with destination port
      of 0. Now also reject extend cells with destination port or address
      of 0. Suggested by lark.
    - When we can't transmit a DNS request due to a network error, retry
      it after a while, and eventually transmit a failing response to
      the RESOLVED cell. Bugfix on 0.1.2.5-alpha.
    - Solve a bug that kept hardware crypto acceleration from getting
      enabled when accounting was turned on. Fixes bug 907. Bugfix on
      0.0.9pre6.
    - When a canonical connection appears later in our internal list
      than a noncanonical one for a given OR ID, always use the
      canonical one. Bugfix on 0.2.0.12-alpha. Fixes bug 805.
      Spotted by rovv.
    - Avoid some nasty corner cases in the logic for marking connections
      as too old or obsolete or noncanonical for circuits. Partial
      bugfix on bug 891.
    - Fix another interesting corner-case of bug 891 spotted by rovv:
      Previously, if two hosts had different amounts of clock drift, and
      one of them created a new connection with just the wrong timing,
      the other might decide to deprecate the new connection erroneously.
      Bugfix on 0.1.1.13-alpha.
    - If one win32 nameserver fails to get added, continue adding the
      rest, and don't automatically fail.
    - Fix a bug where an unreachable relay would establish enough
      reachability testing circuits to do a bandwidth test -- if
      we already have a connection to the middle hop of the testing
      circuit, then it could establish the last hop by using the existing
      connection. Bugfix on 0.1.2.2-alpha, exposed when we made testing
      circuits no longer use entry guards in 0.2.1.3-alpha.
  o Minor bugfixes (directory authorities):
    - Limit uploaded directory documents to be 16M rather than 500K.
      The directory authorities were refusing v3 consensus votes from
      other authorities, since the votes are now 504K. Fixes bug 959;
      bugfix on 0.0.2pre17 (where we raised it from 50K to 500K ;).
    - Directory authorities should never send a 503 "busy" response to
      requests for votes or keys. Bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha; exposed by
      bug 959.
    - Fix code so authorities _actually_ send back X-Descriptor-Not-New
      headers. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
  o Minor bugfixes (hidden services):
    - When we can't find an intro key for a v2 hidden service descriptor,
      fall back to the v0 hidden service descriptor and log a bug message.
      Workaround for bug 1024.
    - In very rare situations new hidden service descriptors were
      published earlier than 30 seconds after the last change to the
      service. (We currently think that a hidden service descriptor
      that's been stable for 30 seconds is worth publishing.)
    - If a hidden service sends us an END cell, do not consider
      retrying the connection; just close it. Patch from rovv.
    - If we are not using BEGIN_DIR cells, don't attempt to contact hidden
      service directories if they have no advertised dir port. Bugfix
      on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
  o Minor bugfixes (tools):
    - In the torify(1) manpage, mention that tsocks will leak your
      DNS requests.
  o Minor bugfixes (controllers):
    - If the controller claimed responsibility for a stream, but that
      stream never finished making its connection, it would live
      forever in circuit_wait state. Now we close it after SocksTimeout
      seconds. Bugfix on 0.1.2.7-alpha; reported by Mike Perry.
    - Make DNS resolved controller events into "CLOSED", not
      "FAILED". Bugfix on 0.1.2.5-alpha. Fix by Robert Hogan. Resolves
      bug 807.
    - The control port would close the connection before flushing long
      replies, such as the network consensus, if a QUIT command was issued
      before the reply had completed. Now, the control port flushes all
      pending replies before closing the connection. Also fix a spurious
      warning when a QUIT command is issued after a malformed or rejected
      AUTHENTICATE command, but before the connection was closed. Patch
      by Marcus Griep. Fixes bugs 1015 and 1016.
    - Fix a bug that made stream bandwidth get misreported to the
      controller.
  o Deprecated and removed features:
    - The old "tor --version --version" command, which would print out
      the subversion "Id" of most of the source files, is now removed. It
      turned out to be less useful than we'd expected, and harder to
      maintain.
    - RedirectExits has been removed. It was deprecated since
      0.2.0.3-alpha.
    - Finally remove deprecated "EXTENDED_FORMAT" controller feature. It
      has been called EXTENDED_EVENTS since 0.1.2.4-alpha.
    - Cell pools are now always enabled; --disable-cell-pools is ignored.
    - Directory mirrors no longer fetch the v1 directory or
      running-routers files. They are obsolete, and nobody asks for them
      anymore. This is the first step to making v1 authorities obsolete.
    - Take out the TestVia config option, since it was a workaround for
      a bug that was fixed in Tor 0.1.1.21.
    - Mark RendNodes, RendExcludeNodes, HiddenServiceNodes, and
      HiddenServiceExcludeNodes as obsolete: they never worked properly,
      and nobody seems to be using them. Fixes bug 754. Bugfix on
      0.1.0.1-rc. Patch from Christian Wilms.
    - Remove all backward-compatibility code for relays running
      versions of Tor so old that they no longer work at all on the
      Tor network.
  o Code simplifications and refactoring:
    - Tool-assisted documentation cleanup. Nearly every function or
      static variable in Tor should have its own documentation now.
    - Rename the confusing or_is_obsolete field to the more appropriate
      is_bad_for_new_circs, and move it to or_connection_t where it
      belongs.
    - Move edge-only flags from connection_t to edge_connection_t: not
      only is this better coding, but on machines of plausible alignment,
      it should save 4-8 bytes per connection_t. "Every little bit helps."
    - Rename ServerDNSAllowBrokenResolvConf to ServerDNSAllowBrokenConfig
      for consistency; keep old option working for backward compatibility.
    - Simplify the code for finding connections to use for a circuit.
    - Revise the connection_new functions so that a more typesafe variant
      exists. This will work better with Coverity, and let us find any
      actual mistakes we're making here.
    - Refactor unit testing logic so that dmalloc can be used sensibly
      with unit tests to check for memory leaks.
    - Move all hidden-service related fields from connection and circuit
      structure to substructures: this way they won't eat so much memory.
    - Squeeze 2-5% out of client performance (according to oprofile) by
      improving the implementation of some policy-manipulation functions.
    - Change the implementation of ExcludeNodes and ExcludeExitNodes to
      be more efficient. Formerly it was quadratic in the number of
      servers; now it should be linear. Fixes bug 509.
    - Save 16-22 bytes per open circuit by moving the n_addr, n_port,
      and n_conn_id_digest fields into a separate structure that's
      only needed when the circuit has not yet attached to an n_conn.
    - Optimize out calls to time(NULL) that occur for every IO operation,
      or for every cell. On systems like Windows where time() is a
      slow syscall, this fix will be slightly helpful.

You don't.  By design, your tor client doesn't trust the tor network.
We routinely scan for misbehaving nodes, notify the operators, and/or
simply drop them off the network.  Otherwise, the vast majority of nodes
are run by people like you trying to help others and increase their own

torbutton hasn't been kept up with thunderbird for a long time.  If
someone wants to write torbutton for thunderbird, or other clients,
we're willing to share our knowledge gained with firefox.  It may be

I set this up and tested it.  The TB3 correctly used SOCKS
localhost:9050 as socks 5 just fine.  It leaked dns, but otherwise the
requests went over Tor.  The RSS poller has some weird timeout when a
feed can't be read via Tor.  However, TB3 just left the feed stale if it
couldn't be updated when tor circuits took longer than 2-3 minutes to
get the data.
As for mail, I could get imaps, pop3s to work over tor just fine.  There
were no exit nodes allowing smtp or s-smtp through their exit policies
when I was testing, so sending mail via tor didn't work (as expected).
Again, dns leaked locally.

It depends if you want it updated every refresh.  Sometimes, tor doesn't
build a circuit fast enough for TB3, so TB3 gives up and moves on.  I
imagine overtime, you'll get your updates just fine.
Actually, no.  The default exit policy blocks smtp ports.  Sometimes,
you can find exit nodes that allow smtp.  These are times are typically
few and far between.
I intend to dig through the tb3 source code a bit to see if there's an
option for forcing dns resolution over the proxy.

There appear to a few ways to set the timeout, unsure which one matters
for rss feed pulls over http over tor from TB3's perspective.
In the Config Editor, there is:
mailnews.tcptimeout set to 100
network.proxy.failover_timeout set to 1800
Changing these doesn't seem to matter too much.  I set them to 9000 and
there were still some test feeds that didn't load (blog.torproject.org
oddly enough).

There is a config option named:

it seems that tor does allow 465 by default.  Sorry for any confusion.
I should learn to RTFC first over my memory.
:      Does it have a way to choose SOCKS 4A instead of SOCKS 5?
It appears SOCKS 4 or 5 are the only options.  SOCKS 5 with the config

This was a display issue with Torbutton.  In both Torbutton 1.2.2 and
Torbutton 1.2.3, it configures firefox to connect on localhost:8118.
Torbutton 1.2.2 had text that said "use privoxy", torbutton 1.2.3 has
text that says "use polipo".  In both cases, the result was the same.
Firefox was configured to use whichever http proxy was shipped on port 8118.
The tor browser bundles (aka the easy bundle) have always included polipo.
There was a bug with bundles that included vidalia 0.2.3 through 0.2.4
where polipo wouldn't start with the correct configuration file.  This
is fixed in vidalia 0.2.6 on osx and linux.  It's fixed in vidalia 0.2.5
on windows.
Rather than talking about some esoteric versions, use the latest

@_subject: Running a Tor Server as a Tax Deduction? 
This question has come up before, as Brian Puccio mentioned, and comes
up again as The Tor Project is a real 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation.
   I'm not a tax attorney, nor CPA, nor accountant; therefore don't take
this as any sort of legal/tax advice. This topic is still under review
by Tor's legal advisors and accountants.  Consider this a quick overview.
There are two issues:
1) US FASB requirements for valuation of contributed services and if
they create or enhance an asset (for assets Tor can recognize in
financial statements).  One of the key points here is whether The Tor
Project would have to pay for the services versus rely on donations of
those services.
2) Legal risks to the Tor Project for having such assets recognized as
belonging to the Tor Project.
We (accountants and Tor) decided that for 2008, Tor would not pay to run
all of the relays.  The design of Tor and therefore the Tor network is
to rely on a decentralized model of informal volunteers to maintain the
The point of discussion is that Tor would be mostly useless if the
public Tor network didn't exist, so clearly this network could have some
value.  However, in order to recognize that value, the Tor Project would
have to record detailed information about every relay operator in order
to accept the contributed service as an asset, and give the donation
valuation to the relay operator.  This comes back into legal risks, and
reverts back to the privacy by design of the Tor software and Tor
network itself.
To help clarify what this could mean, here's an analogy:  Someone
donates a fully operational military tank to the Tor Project.  While we
suddenly have a tremendous asset on our hands (and financial
statements), we're beholden to all sorts of legal risks for owning and
operating a fully operational military tank as a private entity in the US.
We have the right to refuse donations in kind, and essentially we're
doing that with those of you running relays that make up the Tor
network.  We wholly appreciate your efforts (as do all of the Tor
users); it's just that we can't trade your volunteering for financial
gain on your end (through a tax deduction) at this time.
I realize this isn't the definitive answer of "yes or no" you want, but
it's the best I can offer right now as discussions progress.  The
decision can go either way, and I will keep you updated when a decision
is made, with the explanation.
This doesn't preclude direct donations in kind, such as hosting website
mirrors, our website itself, hosting archives, databases, website
design, graphics/artwork, etc.

@_subject: Yahoo Mail and Tor 
There are two reasons why we still ship old Privoxy versions:
A) The Privoxies after 3.06 have a local "web control interface"
which we believe is a security risk. We think that remote websites can
probably reconfigure your privoxy via that interface, maybe even without
your noticing.  If newer versions have the ability to disable this
interface, we can consider testing and subsequently including those with
our packages.
B) We're in the process of switching over to Polipo rather than Privoxy,
since it's smaller, simpler, and it does pipelining better.  You'll
notice that the Tor Browser Bundle we ship already includes Polipo.
Those two reasons combined mean we're leaving the Privoxy that we ship
on the old version.

issue is resolved in current privoxy versions, but I haven't looked.
No, and this is the point.  Polipo is a simple caching http proxy.
Polipo does include the ability to filter traffic by regex, but this is
disabled in our bundles.  If Mozilla would fix at least one bug in the
SOCKS layer, we wouldn't need to ship an http proxy with our bundles at
all.  The bug being, Our goal is not to filter the Internet, but provide anonymity.  Tor
users are free to setup their own solutions if they want ad blocking,
clickjacking protection, etc.  Most people do this in the browser now
with plugins.  If you want to use privoxy, by all means, keep doing so.

This is a fine use of exit policies.  If potential exit-node operators
feel this gives them safety and security, then they should do something
like this.  I may misjudge the popularity of a "safe list", but I don't
think you'll see it expand to a significant percentage of exit policies.
 However, I could be wrong.  The nice thing about the Tor network is
there is no central point policy control by design, so operators can do
what they feel is right for them.
Personally, I don't want to see the equivalent of the Internet Watch
Foundation extended to Tor.  What *I* consider safe is possibly very
different than others.  I use Tor to get open, unfiltered access to the

"Should I snoop on the plaintext that exits through my Tor relay?
No. You may be technically capable of modifying the Tor source code or
installing additional software to monitor or log plaintext that exits
your node. However, Tor relay operators in the U.S. can create legal and
possibly even criminal liability for themselves under state or federal
wiretap laws if they affirmatively monitor, log, or disclose Tor users'
communications, while non-U.S. operators may be subject to similar laws.

@_subject: Bitblinder = Tor 2 
Let's clarify this a bit.  Bitblinder is the same Tor just with
micropayments and 1-hop proxies.  Diff the bitblinder source code with
ours, it's not substantially different.  It's not "tor 2".
I think it's an interesting test of some theories we've been thinking
about already (reducing the number of hops, everyone as a relay,
incentives to be a relay).  There are also risks to each one of these
that we need to research and develop more to understand how they affect
risks to the user and others on the public Tor network.
As for why it's faster, I suspect it's because no one uses it yet.  Wait
until a few hundred thousand people show up and start swapping huge
files over it.  The current Tor network was pretty quick until a year or
two ago.  When we had roughly the same number of nodes but only 50,000
to 100,000 daily users it was great.  Now we're at 300,00 to 500,000
daily users and suffering under the load.  We have a roadmap to make the
Tor network significantly faster, it just takes research and development
(and funding) to do it right.  Tor at the end of this roadmap could be
considered "Tor 2".
I, for one, would feel horrible if we rushed to release something under
the pressure of "make it faster" and exposed all those who rely on Tor
for its strong anonymity properties.  I use tor for 95% of my Internet
traffic, I understand the speed issues very well.

current tor network, is a solid design as good as Tor, or is complete
bunk and merely includes the Tor tarball to say "uses Tor!" for their
marketing purposes.
However, coming up with the idea, and then punting all of the next steps
to the Tor Project doesn't work too well.  I have a list of platforms
that people have stated, "If you can turn Tor into an appliance on
device X, we'll sell it for you and donate x% back to you quarterly."

tomato, sheevaplugs, bug lab's modules, openwrt, ddwrt, windows ce,

This implies that tor is running at debug log level.  Unless you have a
very fast CPU and graphics card, Vidalia's Message Log isn't going to
keep up.
Optimally, you should remove your customized Tor config and simply let
Vidalia do all of the configuration for tor.  It sounds like you
already set or disabled control port authentication, which is why
vidalia can't set one.  The Vidalia configuration window for the
password defaults to "randomly generate", which is generally fine for
securing the control port.

I'm trying to understand this distinction, because the German press has
a habit of misunderstanding the details and claiming Tor operators are
targeted by law enforcement.  The reality could be 500 computers were
confiscated and 5 were Tor exit nodes.  The press has only focused on
those 5 tor exit nodes claiming the existence of Tor is the reason for
the confiscation.  This is incorrect.
The real reason, at least explained to us to by law enforcement, is the
computers were targeted because they have a log file, a list of IPs, and
those who were assigned the IP at the time.  They head out to collect
all the computers at each address and don't know what to expect.

As highlighted in the 0.2.2.1-alpha release notes, the Vidalia Bundle
for OS X includes some major changes. Many of these are for ease of use
and user experience improvements. The release of OS X 10.6 (Snow
Leopard) gave me a fine excuse to release the improvements.
It's best to un-install Tor/Vidalia and then install this new bundle;
rather than upgrade. If you want to upgrade, you'll need to update the
paths for Tor and Polipo in the Vidalia Settings window.
There has been a lot of testing since this test release of the drag and

installation far easier, less error prone, and keep all of the bundle in

abuse complaints and dmca threat letters, but a simple response has

expect when encountering a tor exit node in their cases, and that we're
going to both answer their questions and help exit node operators caught
up in their cases.

Truecrypt on os x needs macfuse to work.  If your tor/vidalia is
installed to the truecrypt volume, then you need truecrypt to work.  If
you remove macfuse, but not truecrypt, you have a broken truecrypt
installation.  If your truecrypt is broken, then you can't get to your

On Mon, 16 Aug 2010 20:32:13 -0700
First off, your enthusiasm and questioning our decisions is great and
encouraged.  Will you help us?
Yes, this is by design.  For years we've been a boring R&D organization
working away in relative obscurity.  Only in the past year have we been
forced into the public spotlight.  First was the growing number of
Chinese citizens that found Tor circumvented the GFW just fine, and
protected their privacy when doing so.  Second was the Iranian protests
in June 2009.  We now answer the press questions, appear on tv/radio
shows, panels, and other Internet media.  There's an internal debate
over how much publicity is good versus harmful.  We've learned that keeping a relatively low profile continues to let us
work on the R&D, rather than writing policy papers and dealing with
bureaucracy.  Many other organizations are great at doing the latter
two. We're happy to subcontract from the latter types of organizations,
which lets us focus on R&D.
Yes, 2 years ago that was more money than we could handle.  It's taken
6-8 months to ramp up to handle more funding and to get everyone
productive.  This includes finding the right people, passing audits,
managing the workload, and getting infrastructure assembled so people
can do their jobs.  Conversely, think of all we've been able to accomplish with that
$500k.  As Paul mentioned later in this thread, we did.  Karen is awesome and
currently handling the fundraising, policy meetings, grant writing, and
marketing for us.  However, she's one person, she could use help.
We are self-limiting.  Too much growth, too fast, will kill us.
Bigger isn't always better.  We are a cash and project-based business.
By design, we take on slightly more than we can handle.  Think of a
startup versus a Fortune 50 company.  Like all startups, there is much
more to do than people to do it. That's fine, as it forces us to focus
on what's important.  We don't have an endowment to smooth out the
funding roller coaster.  All of our contracts can be cancelled at any
point in time. We either deliver or die.  R&D work is much different than writing policy statements, legal
opinions, and producing documentaries.  So far, the UN, IGF, and parts
of various governments don't understand what we say nor what we do.  I'm
happy to keep talking to them and work on something that works for both
organizations.  Education and training seems to be the common ground
where we speak the same language.
We've recently started attracting potential sponsors that want us to
stand up for anonymity in general.  Starting to counter the
surveillance by design mentality of the general populace is a different
focus for us.  Frankly, the EFF and ACLU may be better at this than us,
nevertheless discussions continue. I agree.  We're working with a surprising number of people in those
categories.  However, the vast majority of the world doesn't understand
how the Internet works, nevermind how Tor can help them.  Education is
a big deal which takes time and understanding.  I can't tell you how many times I've explained to victims of domestic
violence, child abuse, or human rights activists that organizing over
some social networking site is a horrible idea. There are many, many
good things that come out of social networking sites, but too many of
them are careless with private information or not clear in what is
collected, how it is collected, and how it is shared. This fact comes
back to bite people or groups in unexpected ways. In many cases, people
have lost their jobs, been arrested, or put their families and extended
networks at risk because of something on a social network site. I don't want people to use Tor because we told them to do so. I want
them to use Tor because they understand the risks and realize they need
it.  This is a very US/Canadian value.  There are plenty of countries out
there where the general population trusts and believes in their
governments.  The average Chinese citizen appreciates that their
government protects them from bad things on the Internet with the GFW.
However, they fear "human flesh search" or corporate espionage and want
protection.  The point is that the world is a complex place, and
privacy/anonymity mean different things to different cultures.  Trying
to figure this out is the challenge.
There are anonymity and security issues to iron out, a few of which
Paul addresses later in this thread.  We are talking to the ISPs and
cloud providers.  They are large organizations scared of change
and what others may think about them if someone does something bad with
Tor through their IP space.  Everyone focuses on the exceptions of bad
behavior over Tor, very few focus on the vast majority of traffic that
helps someone.  However, we have bridges, exit policies, and lots of
other technologies they could sponsor just as easily.  This is a long answer to your questions and suggestions.  However, I
encourage the debate.  Even more so, I encourage action to help us.

Tor provides anonymity, ssl provides content encryption in transit.  I
use Tor for everything because I generally don't trust the local
network to not inject ads, record my traffic, or otherwise modify my
traffic as it leaves my computer.  This is true for home, travel,
phones, etc.
I have no problem logging into a website I trust through Tor over ssl.
I am not my IP address, just like I am not my postal address.  IP
addresses are for routing, not for authentication.  It's up to me if I
want to let my bank see my real IP address, or if I want to show up
from the USA when in Thailand.  As for your comment about "pain to switch", use two browsers.  One for
your Tor-based activities, and one for non-Tor activities.

The challenge here is to define "strong anonymity".  A possible current
definition is a state of not being identifiable within an anonymity set.
This anonymity is considered strong if it is resistant to all known
attacks on anonymity.  I think Roger wrote that line in the source to simply remind people that
Tor has a defined threat model, given the anonymity research field
is still growing, and that low-latency anonymity is inherently open to
some attacks, tor is not strong anonymity.
Tor raises the bar for de-anonymizing you to many attacks on your
anonymity on the actual internet today.  This is a fine place to start
to understand what Tor does and does not provide,
Many other tools simply state they are anonymous, without mentioning any
of the R&D on current anonymity attacks, their success probabilities,
and design flaws. If you're interested in learning more about the
current state of the field of anonymity in research, start here;
All tools have design goals and threat models.  Many just don't clearly
state what these goals and threats are to the user, but brush it under
the rug as perfect anonymity, or some other hyperbole.  Disclaimer:  Roger, Nick, and Steven are the anonymity researchers,
their opinion overrules mine.

In fact, these documents are already public.  They are available through
us on request, as required by US tax laws. Or, generally through
GuideStar or Charity Navigator.  There's nothing secret here,
it's all public.  Every 501c3 has to file these every year.
Tor develops in public, meets in public, and is generally approachable
for questions, comments, or concerns.  We specifically chose to be a
501c3 for the transparency factor.  We could easily have been a
for-profit entity with many willing investors to create black box
software.  We believe in the right to online anonymity and
developing and improving it with Tor.  The adversaries to online
anonymity are vastly better funded to the tune of trillions of dollars,
and in some cases, can tax their populace to better oppress them.  There are two points in that statement.  First, we've repeatedly stated
that you should evaluate our designs, the code, and to verify the
binaries we produce. Second, many organizations want anonymity online.
These organizations need Tor and/or our advice to accomplish their
goals. Our examples of Tor users gives you an idea of who wants their
anonymity online, We will accept funding from people who understand our mission, our
goals, and generally our research and development model of progress. We
don't take funding we don't feel comfortable handling.  We generally
work along two paths at once:
1) Research, attack, and improve the Tor design.  Low-latency anonymity
and the general field of anonymous Internet communications are still
relatively young.  Research into these fields takes anywhere from 3
to 10 years to solidify designs, develop attacks, and then develop
defenses to attacks;
2) Turn the research into code.  Improving the codebase and
the growing number of accessory programs for Tor is a growing
challenge. We have a live Tor network that is used by half a million
people a day.  We want to make sure that Tor works for those putting
their life on the line.  Therefore, we must make sure Tor is the
strongest we can make it to provide anonymity online.
The US and European Governments are large entities. They feed people,
protect citizens, save lives, make bombs, and get involved in wars.
They do not speak with one voice and one mission. For all of the people
who publicly state anonymity should disappear, there are just as many
who want to see anonymity strengthened. We are finishing up the 2009 audits and filings this month.  We will
announce our first ever annual report soon, and post the 2007 through
2009 IRS 990 forms, financial statements, and reviews.  This is what
you want to watch for progress on this front,
The best way we know to combat conspiracy theories and cranks is for the
organization to be as transparent as possible.  We hope you'll join us in protecting, providing, and strengthening
anonymity online.

The Chinese GFW team has been actively blocking all public relays since
the 60th Anniversary of the CCP in Sept 2009.  In March 2010, the GFW
admins ramped up and crawled all of bridges.torproject website and flooded
requests to bridges at torproject from around 6000 unique gmail accounts.
We've been re-balancing the various bridge pools to create more churn so
the GFW admins have to keep crawling in order to block the public
bridges.  We released a batch of bridges via social networking sites in
China mid-summer and those bridges are working fine.  New bridges seem to be blocked within 1-2 weeks.  We are working on a
number of things to improve the availability of tor in China.  In the
arms race of censor vs. circumvention, China's GFW is the furthest
along at Step 3 (attempt to block the bridges).  We are trying to have
this arms race as slow as possible.  One of the problems with the bridge
solution right now is that there are so few of them.  See
 for the current count of
bridges in the top graph. Many users in China are using vpns and other insecure proxies, and then
using tor over those technologies to protect their traffic and browsing.
Fluffybunny vpn, hot spot shield, and others are popular right now.  We want to roll out a better bridge design that makes it vastly more
expensive to try to block. The research and development on this step has
been underway for a while. Other projects to simply increase the
quantity of bridges are the Torouter [1] and bridge-bundle [2] plans we're
working on towards a March 2011 release.

We do not hide the fact that you are using a Tor exit node.  It's trivial for
someone to correlate the IP address of the exit node with that of your

the service already knows you are a tor user.  If they want to learn
which of the 4 million tor users you are, they need to start looking for
individual parameters that make you unique.  User agent is one of these

The first question is, "why a http proxy at all?"
The answer is, because Firefox SOCKS layer has hard-coded timeouts, and
other issues, Personally, I don't use an http proxy, I simply let my browser talk to
tor via socks directly.  The user experience sucks, because you'll
receive untold numbers of "The connection has timed out" warnings,
because firefox won't wait for Tor to build a circuit.  Chrome, Safari,
and Arora (amongst others) don't have this problem.
Once Firefox fixes bug 280661, we don't need a http proxy at all.
However, given the current pace of progress on 280661, we may switch to
Chrome before the fix occurs.
The second question is, "why switch from privoxy to polipo?"
Privoxy is fine filtering software that works well for what is it
intended to do.  However, it's user experience is lacking due to it
lacking a few features, namely, http 1.1 pipelining, caching most
requested objects, and it needs to see the entire page to parse it,
before sending it on to the browser.  Lack of these three features is
the reason we switched from privoxy to polipo.
We've received plenty of feedback that browsing with polipo in place of
privoxy "feels faster".  The feedback indicates that because polipo
streams the content to the browser for rendering nearly as fast as it
receives it from Tor, the user understands what's going on and will
start to read the web page as it loads.  Privoxy, necesarily, will load
the entire page, parse it for items to be filtered, and then send the
page on to the browser.  The user experience, especially on a slow
circuit, is that nothing happens, the browser activity icon spins
forever, and suddenly a page appears many, many seconds later.
If Tor was vastly faster, privoxy's mode of operation wouldn't matter.
We're working on making Tor faster.  However, purposely showing the user
how slow tor can be with privoxy was a huge point of complaint, and not
what we intended to do.
Does polipo have some bugs?  Sure.  Chrisd primarily, among others, is
working on fixing them.  At the current rate of progress on firefox bug
280661, we'll have polipo fixed before mozilla releases the SOCKS layer
fix.  Chrisd even wrote Mozilla a patch and submitted it on the bug.
The final point is that this is all free software.  You are in control.
 If you don't like polipo, but do like privoxy, then don't install
polipo and use privoxy.
The power of choice is yours.

I should clarify that by Chrome, I really mean Chromium, the free and
open source version of Chrome; We'd like to stop eviscerating Firefox with Torbutton.  Rather, we could
integrate torbutton functionality into private/incognito browsing mode.
 Chromium is relatively new, and we're working with the team to
implement the APIs necessary to integration of a truly anonymous/private
browsing mode.
We'd also like to work with Mozilla on the same pathway, but so far we
haven't made the right connections in the organization to have this happen.

No, we don't build our own Firefox yet.  I've been resisting adding
"Tor's firefox" to the list of software we maintain and build every
release.  However, yes it may become worthwhile to build our own
Firefox, and integrate Chrisd's patch.
I have mixed feelings as well.   Chromium/chrome has a nice sandboxing
model, is very fast at rendering, and in general is a nice browser.
It's new enough that by implementing some api's for us, we can integrate
torbutton functionality into it far easier than the current reverse
engineering we have to do with firefox.
Alternatives could be like torfox and torora, where you just build the
browser from the start with Tor in mind.

The wiki is written by volunteers, people like you.  If you don't

We don't compare ourselves to individual solutions because we're not in
competition with them.  There are literally thousands of "online
privacy" providers, sometimes called web proxies, sometimes vpns, and
sometimes ssh tunnels.  There are other websites, such as proxy.org,
that do a fine job of comparing the top solutions.
We do research and development into online privacy and anonymity.  Our
goal is to solve the hard problems that exist in the field today and
will exist in the near future.
We compare ourselves to the general class of single-hop proxies (ssh,
vpn, http/https proxies) so users can understand the security and
anonymity properties that are different.  If someone wants to figure out
how to objectively evaluate all possible solutions and compare and
contrast, great.  We as the Tor Project, aren't going to do it.

Before this devolves into personal attacks, we designed the system so
that if users divulge a bridge address or three the entire system won't
be compromised.  If the bridge address system required users never
making mistakes and publishing the addresses of the bridges, we could
have taken better precautions against accidental disclosure.
Another odd point is that most censors aren't blocking bridges. We've
been tweeting/qq'ing bridges for 4 months around China and they aren't
blocked.  (Dear China GFW censors, this is not a challenge.)  Commercial
firewall vendors also seem to ignore bridges as well.  Why?
In the grand scheme of things, 95% of a population doesn't use any sort
of proxying technology, and so far as we've been able to count, a few
million people have downloaded tor.   Compared to the roughly 1.7
billion people online, it's an exceedingly small number.  We believe the
goal of the censors is to maintain the impression of control.  Unless
you're going to whitelist the internet, which is already happening in
some commercial firewall products and in parts of some countries, then
someone will find a way through.   However, if 95%+ of your population
is none the wiser, great, you sure look like you can control the Internet.
Publishing lists of bridges is bad, but not the end of the world.  I
mean, we give them out over unencrypted email and microblogging sites.
Effectively, we're publishing them to the world.

All Tor users should look the same.  Not the same as all Tor users look

On Sat, Jan 9, 2010 at 2:05 PM, emigrant I don't wish to decrease the number of hops, but recently, some people
have posted to the list saying they would like to have the option of
decreasing the number of hops in a circuit to decrease latency and
improve performance.
Reading these discussions got me thinking about why three hops are
used instead of two.
I now see that the main reason for using three hops is that it gives
plausible deniability to exit nodes and entry nodes (not sure if
that's the right term, but what I mean is that node operators can be
confident that even if their machines are seized, no useful
information will be present on them).  Certainly this is very
important, especially from a legal point of view.

TOR ENTRY POINT RIGHT HERE! so that it is less likely for IT departments to be able to easily block access to such (I am also prevented from accessing any proxy servers and they often name themselves as proxies to boot so they scream their nature and make it easy to block).  Is there any way to create tor entry point servers that provide the benefits of the tor network without the cost of providing the site with user ID AND endpoint site?
As someone else said, these are called bridges.
I've met people who work on systems that are effectively a dumb terminal

how to either bypass the blocking or get tor working.  I've also noted

We turn down funding when organizations ask us to run relays on their
behalf.  They have the money, but not the technical skills to run
relays.  The risk to The Tor Project, the non-profit entity, is that we
become a target as we could potentially see a large percentage of Tor
network traffic.  This traffic becomes interesting to law enforcement,
criminal organizations, marketers, and others wanting to enumerate Tor
users.  This same concern is true for the funding organization.  A human rights
organization wanted to run either hundreds of relays or to see their
relay names as the top 10 relays in the Vidalia network map for a
year.  They almost looked at the network map/relay list as a branding
opportunity.  However, controlling relays with that much traffic, even
if the relays are dispersed around the world, would turn them into a
data collection target.  I encourage a peer to peer model of getting more relays.  Having
individuals run a relay and contribute the bandwidth that makes sense
seems to be a less risky model.  As the risk is spread out amongst
hundreds or thousands of individuals.  This is a more difficult path
than turning lots of money into relays.  Ultimately, I believe this
path is more sustainable in the long-term.  As committed relay
operators run them for their own reasons, not for a paycheck.
Active areas of research are around "everyone as a bridge" and "everyone
as a relay" if the tor client finds itself reachable by the outside
world.  Getting these options correct without screwing users is
difficult.  However, we are making progress.
In the meanwhile, we need more relays, in particular exit relays, to
help speed up Tor for everyone.

Yes, and there's some research into Autonomous System (AS) level

The idea is based on the assumption that there are organizations with
more money then technical skill willing to fund someone to run a relay
for some defined period of time, bandwidth, etc.  I'm not sure this is
true at this point in time.
However, this doesn't mean that starting a marketplace or exchange where
people with some money can meet people with technical skill in operating
a relay is a bad idea.  It's a fine experiment to learn about the demand
from both ends, and figure out what the market would decide on pricing
for slow/fast relays, non-exit/exit relays, branded/Unnamed relays, and
reliability and uptime.  Of course, this could also introduce some
interesting incentives to cheat.

Yes.  And more frequently, people are responding to the fear of Internet
surveillance (ad networks, search conglomeration, traffic analysis, etc)
by installing Tor because someone or somewhere told them it was a fine
solution to these problems.  These people don't understand what they
fear and do not understand what Tor gives them.  I've heard repeatedly
something like, "I installed Tor, have a green onion, and my IE browsing

Yes, this is how MyFamily works.  Each node in the family must be
configured to list all other nodes in the family.  If I start up node
Alice, and list Bob and Mallory in MyFamily, Bob must list Alice and
Mallory, and Mallory must list Alice and Bob.  If Mallory lists Alice
and Bob, but neither Alice nor Bob list Mallory, it's not a valid
Family.  Otherwise, Mallory could list every node in the network and
screw everyone.  Or list all nodes in the network but 3 and shunt all
traffic through those 3, etc.

@_author: Andrew Lewman 
@_subject: Family specifications (was: Re: perfect-privacy.com, Family specifications, etc) 
If only one side could declare a valid family that clients honored, you can control the paths clients choose. Eventually, some large percent of the network will find your declaration and be unable to build paths because they are all in the one-sided MyFamily declaration.  Or, worse off, you run three nodes, let's call them TheMan0, TheMan1, and TheMan2.  All three nodes list every other node in the network, except your three TheMan# nodes.  Now as clients find your MyFamily declaration, they can only build paths through TheMan0, TheMan1, and TheMan2.  Now you've won.
This is one reason why the MyFamily declaration has to be the same on both sides in order for clients to honor it.  Tor clients do not trust the Tor network by design.  There are flaws in the MyFamily scheme, as we're seeing with perfect-privacy.  It's a pain in the ass if you run a lot of nodes, so you just don't bother.  It also assumes an honest relay operator will list all of all the nodes that should be in a MyFamily declaration.
Right now, Tor won't use any relays in a circuit in the same /16 network to try to address "network closeness" of relays.  We saw it was plausible that someone can start up a bunch of relays in the same datacenter in the same netblock and start to see a lot of circuits within that netblock.  You can disable this behavior by setting EnforceDistinctSubnets to 0.
It is an open and active area of  research as to the degree of anonymity (increase or decrease) one receives as you develop trusted paths through the network (pick your own path), or Autonomous System aware paths, or country level aware paths, etc.

@_subject: Bridges and China (new thread) 
Rather than continue to hijack the old thread, here's a new one about
bridges and china.
I'm fully aware the GFW seems to have successfully crawled
 and added all of those bridges into their
blocking regime.  The email distribution method, bridges at torproject.org,
may also have been crawled and added to the blocking regime.  There are
still 3 other pools of bridge addresses, one of which is held in
reserve.  It seems the other two methods are continuing to work, as a
paltry 5000 connections from China still can access Tor daily.  This is
vastly smaller than the 100,000 or so we used to get.  The other methods of obtaining bridges are slower and more viral.  They
use social networking technologies like twitter and qq to distribute
bridge addresses.  I've been told if you search on baidu, you can find
such bridge addresses.  And until now, they still work.  We've given
some addresses to trusted networks inside China. What they do with the
bridges is up to them.  I've heard some are bridge addresses are being
released by blog posts, BBS posts, qq, and ads on taobao. I'm assuming
the admins of the GFW read or-talk in some fashion.  They are doing
their job and we're doing ours.
Conversely, Tor supports 3rd party http/https proxies.  Many people use
Tor because they want the privacy aspects of it, not just the ability to
circumvent a firewall.  You can use the 3rd party http/https proxy as
the access layer around the blocking system, and then to tor.
This is an arms race, we're working on next steps in it.

The point of releasing the bridge addresses this way is to see how long

For this specific topic, it is here: In general, all US non-profits have to file a Form 990 with the IRS
annually.  It is a public document that lays out who funds the non-profit
and how much, where the funds went, and a categorization of how the funds

find the 990 and evaluate their performance for yourself.  There are
other non-profits who make up metrics and rate non-profits on these
made-up metrics.  YMMV.

Yes.  The CCC has a bank account just for donations for their Tor
activities.  The banking info for the CCC will return to our donation
webpage shortly.
As for the question, "why can't Tor do this already?"  We've been told
repeatedly and by very smart lawyers, do not host relays in the name of
the non-profit Tor Project, Inc.  An oversimplification of the advice is
that we can spend our money on making more scalable, better performing,
and more anonymous Tor, or spend our money fighting lawsuits from anyone
claiming the non-profit is responsible for the traffic it transmits.  We
produce code, not legal statements of defense.  We're always open to
legal advice to the contrary. This FAQ is still valid,
As for a 3rd party hosting fast exit nodes, great.  Tor needs more
relays to scale.  The network is already overloaded and we're sustaining
around 500,000 daily users out of roughly 30 million downloads in the
last 12 calendar months.  Tor is slow, this is not news to anyone.  What
is news is that there is such a demand for online anonymity and privacy
half a million people are willing to take the slowness to protect
themselves.  I2P and FreeNet are also seeing growth over the past year
or two as well.  As the saying goes, "All ships rise with the tide."
The topic of an exchange or marketplace to match those with money to
those with technical skill in running relays is not new.  It's been an
internal debate for the past year or two.  Incentives can have unforseen
consequences, see
 for lots of
details.  This legal environments change dramatically from country to
country.  Right now, the US is probably the best place to run an exit
node, given tor has "common carrier like status" according to the
aforementioned smart lawyers.  Internally, we decided we aren't economists
and would probably suck at running such an exchange.  This doesn't mean
you cannot try.
Coldboot in the UK is also trying something similar.  The more the
merrier.  I've had casual conversations with some global ISPs about
running their own Tor networks as a value-added service to customers
wishing to escape the defacto Internet surveillance that exists today.
Not one has started such a thing to my knowledge.  My suggestion for those considering doing something like Kickstart is to
do a year at a time.  It's easier to raise $2400 to fund a fast exit
node at someplace like 100tb.com for a year than it will be to raise
$200/mo for 12 months.  Buy the server for a year and post a copy of the
receipt somewhere.  People will check throughout the year to see the
server is still online.  If not, figure out some refund plan pro-rated
to months left in the contract if the server lasts less than a year.
Maybe some other non-profit could offer to be a fiscal sponsor so the
donations are tax-deductible.  My USD $0.02.

The quick answer is that this is a known active attack, and has been

hostile node can create circuits through itself, or alter traffic
patterns to affect traffic at other nodes. Nonetheless, a hostile node
must be immediately adjacent to both endpoints to compromise the
anonymity of a circuit. If an adversary can run multiple ORs, and can
persuade the directory servers that those ORs are trustworthy and
independent, then occasionally some user will choose one of those ORs
for the start and another as the end of a circuit. If an adversary
controls m > 1 of N nodes, he can correlate at most ([m/N])2 of the

@_subject: beneficia versus maleficia 
It seems what you are wrestling with is the dual use nature of
any technology.  Some easy examples are: highways are used to transport pregnant mothers
to hospitals to deliver cuddly babies and to transport kidnappers and
their victims across the country.  The phone system is used to let you
keep in touch with your friends and family and to stalk and harass
domestic violence victims.  Firewalls are used by companies to keep
their employees protected by outside threats and used by governments to
repress their citizenry.
From my work with victims of domestic violence, abusers and survivors
use technology in surprising ways.  From cooking pots to butter knives
to pre-paid anonymous cellphones, I've seen the technologies used to
abuse and used to help.  It comes down to if you believe the good uses outweigh the bad uses.
Technologies are generally introduced with a narrow use case in mind.
Seldom to these technologies stick to their original use case over time.
We have real situations in which tor is used at
  For every bad thing some jerk
does over tor, there are likely 50-100 more using tor for good reasons.
Think about all of the bandwidth tor relays push and how many of the
connections result in complaints or abuse.  The bad uses are more
public but still the vast minority.
In the end, tor is a technology.  It can be used for both good and
bad.  We develop, advocate, and continue to work on tor for the
positive outcomes; whatever that may mean for your morals and locale.

It depends on the VPN.  Many vpns don't touch your dns settings,

Many people use Tails[1] for this on a dedicated host, or they're waiting

of all TCP traffic over Tor. The concern is that this is going to

It can do that, assuming your ISP is cross-referencing every IP accessed
with a list of current tor relays.
Using a bridge can also speed up your tor circuits if your connection to

This hasn't been true for years.  All connections to the tor directory
are through a single-hop tor connection, between your client and the
directory server. Somewhere in the 0.2.1.x releases we defaulted to the
wrapped connection (therefore encrypted) between the client and relay

Right now, you don't know as a user. Tor tries the bridges and if they
fail, puts it on a counter to try again later. Vidalia, the graphical
interface you see, has no way to show working vs. non-working bridges. I
believe there is a ticket open about this somewhere in trac, but I

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB - most secure version? 
TBB is going to be the easiest.  From a usage perspective, it is download, unzip, run.  Tor is not easy from the perspective of trying to understand all of the risks, rewards, and challenges with online privacy and anonymity. Torbutton 1.4.1 is compatible with Firefox 6.0.
The TBB contain torbutton embedded in Firefox.  We're finding that allowing users to toggle torbutton on and off is fraught with difficulties and data leaks. See Mike's post for far more information,   And correct, they do not contain Privoxy nor Polipo.  Privoxy is a fine filtering proxy, however it's slow and doesn't handle HTTP 1.1, and is complex to configure for 90% of our users.  When we shipped privoxy, it was a non-
filtering configuration that merely acted as glue between Firefox and Tor.  We needed the glue because Firefox through version 4 contained a bug in the SOCKS layer.  See this FAQ entry for more information, The Tor 0.2.2-x branch is now stable.  We believe it is safe to use.  The new -alpha branch is very alpha and probably contains all sorts of new risks yet to be discovered.  The Tor Browser Bundles with 0.2.2.-stable are being updated and released this week. The -rc versions of 0.2.2 were also safe, but we wanted to make sure everything worked as planned for as many people as possible before declaring them -stable.

It transparently proxies all apps running in Tails through Tor. All UDP is either sent through i2p or dropped.
In general, our thoughts on transparent proxying on Windows fall to the
"tor network adapter" model. Openvpn does this just fine. One of the
complications is handling all of the non-TCP traffic. Should a 'tor
network adapter' just drop non-TCP? Should it tunnel udp in tcp? if so,
what unencapsulates udp over tcp on the other end?
And getting a 'tor network adapter' correct requires skills we don't
currently have. If some talented Windows network coder wants to try,
lots of people would love it. coderman tried with his 'torvm' idea,

In general, no. Other than, the multiple check servers need to run by
very trusted people, as they see every TBB startup.
Specifically, the check codebase is getting replaced by torbel. Even
better is to get rid of the need to hit an external site at all. If TBB
could load up 99% of the check site locally, perhaps making a simple query
to check.tpo to receive an answer to 'tor or not', that would work
better. Best is if TBB never has to hit an external site to query anything
to determine 'tor or not'. Torora had some way to determine 'tor or not'
locally, and in a fairly reliable way.

Mike can answer this better, but I believe the main problem with this
is that Firefox doesn't have a per-tab reference model.  Meaning, a
non-tor tab could reload some content in a tor-tab, de-anonymizing you
in the process.  Or some javascript/metarefresh can load between tabs
and get your non-tor state and then your tor-state; which correlates
your identity in both cases.

There has been much discussion over a combined tor and polipo package,
as well as a vidalia-tor-polipo package for deb-based systems.  The core issue is that packages should not overwrite other packages
config files.  We've generally assumed (wrongly) that linux users
understand their system and can handle manual configuration of a few
packages, such as tor, polipo, and vidalia.  The general answer for
users who just want a tor client is to use the tor browser bundle.  The real answer is to fix firefox so it doesn't need a proxy between it
and Tor.  We patch firefox to do just this in the osx and linux tor
browser bundles.  Polipo was a fine kludge until either we started
patching firefox or mozilla fixed their many-years-old socks bug.
I tried to summarize this state of affairs in

On February 19, 2011, we are migrating or-talk from or-talk at seul.org to
tor-talk at lists.torproject.org.  We will migrate your e-mail address's
subscription to the new list. You will receive a confirmation from the

Current or-talk archives will be migrated.  Roger plans to leave the
current archives in place at seul.org as well.
We're using this migration to spread administration out to Tor's
sysadmin team rather than making Roger do everything himself.  The

@_subject: Tor exits in .edu space 
First and foremost, thank you.  We're trying to figure this out ourselves.  I've personally been the
introduction point between exit relay operators and a lawyer in their
country to help them when something goes wrong.  I've spoken to a number
of organizations, such as law enforcement, Internet providers, and
schools about what Tor is, who uses it, and how we can help when
criminals use tor.  In some cases, I've travelled to meet people to
spend time with them and help them as best I can.  Law enforcement organizations are generally surprised when we show up
to talk to them, to educate them, and explain that real people use tor
for real reasons.  If all you see all day are criminals using a hammer,
then clearly hammers are only for criminals.  It's the same with Tor.
It's frequently the case that their own investigators are using Tor to
hide their tracks online too, and are willing to show up to support us
and talk about how they use it.  I hope this helps stop SWAT teams from
kicking down doors when someone exits traffic for a jerk.
I've talked to people on the steps of their local police station just
after they were released from jail the night before.  I've talked to
people looking at academic suspension and huge fines because of a DMCA
notice.  This is why I started contacting law firms in various
countries to find resources for people,

people like this that help keep your liberties around the world.  Once

North Korea doesn't have Internet, much less personal computers

Circumventing the state-run proxy/firewall may be illegal.  However,
I'm sure if a Ministry of Culture wants to trump up charges, "crimes
against the common good or morals" is a fine charge to levy on someone
in custody.  A fine bit of legal research would be to discover in which
countries circumventing a national firewall or blocklist is illegal.

@_subject: Is "gatereloaded" a Bad Exit? 
In my opinion, judging a relay based on exit policy is a slippery slope
we don't want to go down.  We never claim to make using Tor alone safer
than using the Internet at large.  Whether the creep is at Starbucks
sniffing the wifi or running a relay is irrelevant to me.  Encouraging
people to use encrypted communications, the https everywhere firefox
extension, and learn to be more secure online are some of our goals.
The Tor Browser Bundle, while still a work in progress, is the best way
to protect novice users and get them safer than they are without Tor.
I personally run encrypted services on unencrypted ports, like 25, 80,
143, 110, etc.  It's just a port number and only convention says port
80 has to be for http only.  If people start doing deep packet inspection to enforce 80 is really
http or running filters in some misguided attempt to block "bad
things" through Tor, then those are reasons to 'badexit' relays.  There
are some obvious ways we can detect traffic manipulation through Tor
relays.  Today, we do detect them and badexit those relays.
If we're going to start censoring Tor exits based on impressions, we
might as well start blocking Tor relays that are rumoured to be run by
national intelligence agencies, criminal organizations, martians, and
other people we might not like.  In fact, we might as well go back to
the original model of "every Tor relay operator has met and gained
Roger's trust". I want a diverse set of Tor relays. If people don't want to trust
relays based on whatever heuristics they want to use, great, use

@_subject: [tor-talk] Talking to users 
On July 4th, with svn commit r24859, I put the official tor phone number on the 'Contact Us' page.  This same phone number has been on the press page for ages.  I did this to see what would happen, and to give people an obvious way to call us.  I've heard from a number of people over the past year that they wish there was a way to call Tor and ask a question.  Perhaps this is a larger sign of our website and documentation needing help. Perhaps some people just like to talk on the phone.  The phone rings about twice a day on average.  I've had some great conversations with people, ranging from victims of cyberstalking, to law enforcement, and many regular people with questions.  I also talked someone who wanted to know if tor could help them resist the 'smart dust' from the cia being blown into their central air system to implant false memories to convince them they are not an actual time traveler from centuries in the future.  The good news is, something like tor is wildly popular in the 2400s.
I've also pointed a few people at various relakks and ipredator, because they didn't care about anonymity, just geolocation and circumvention for various There have been some tickets created as a result of these phone calls:
* * * One set of tickets came from a 30 minute conversation with someone:
* * * The top three complaints so far have been:
1. Tor is too complex.  2. Lack of Adobe Flash breaks too many websites.
3. Tor's documentation is too hard to find on the Internet.
Here are my general impressions on the complaints.
*Tor is too complex.* Most of the people don't care about Tor per se. They care about using Tor as a tool to get some task or function done.  In most cases, this is protecting their identity online.  They don't want to buy in to Tor, join our religion, nor subscribe to our newsletter.  They just want to use it and not have to worry about it.  The exceptions to this were the cyberstalking victim and the law enforcement officer.  Both felt Tor was too complex, but cared very much about Tor as more than just a tool.  Neither realized the Tor Browser Bundle existed.
*Lack of Adobe Flash breaks too many websites.*  People use Tor to circumvent censorship to watch cats on YouTube and other video sites.  Apparently people also use Tor for Facebook and a number of other sites that require Flash to be functional.  One person told me that the risk of a rogue Flash app disclosing their identity is acceptible over Tor.  The flash cookie problem is 'easily taken care of by plugins, dude'.  I'm sensing that Flash is the main reason people start with TBB and then move on to installing Tor locally; and finding it complex and difficult to configure.  Perhaps the sandboxing technology we're using in the OS X TBB will make its way into Windows and Linux soon.
*Tor's documentation is too hard to find on the Internet.*  I agree.  I have trouble finding the docs and various configuration parameters needed.  This is even more the case when someone is on the phone asking a question.  Clearly we need to improve this for everyone.  Our docs are scattered across git, svn, website, trac tickets, and wiki links.  Maybe one central location that pulls all of this into some coherent page would be a good first step. Maybe a search crawler that worked well would be also be a good step.
I welcome feedback and comments.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Traffic retention of TOR-Relays in Denmark 
Let's take this apart into some easy to digest pieces.  First, I belive the law is to record IP packet header information, not the contents themselves.  While this is bad, it's the basis of traffic analysis and exactly one scenario in which Tor can defend the user. In part, I'm basing my understanding of this law from The logs of a connection running a non-exit relay or bridge are going to only see encrypted traffic to and from the home computer.  The logged packets may show someone using Tor, but the traffic contained within is still encrypted. The connections will between Tor user and Tor relay, and Tor relay to Tor relay.  Currently, Tor does not try to hide that you are using Tor.  Tor doesn't scream 'I'm using Tor', but at the same time, if your adversary is looking really closely, they can deduce you are using Tor.  The good news is that we're working on pluggable transports and obfuscating proxies to hide the fact that you are using Tor.  The logs of a connection running an exit relay is going to see encrypted traffic from other relays and whatever traffic exited from itself to a destination.  The logs will record lots of traffic from people other than the ISP subscriber.  Some small percentage of this data may be illicit, as defined by local laws.  This is the same risk for exit relays now.  Other information about protections tor provides against an adversary recording your traffic can be found at

I don't think this is a malicious relay, as I get these from time to

exit relay at the time in question, and that your exit could have been
used for the suspected crime.  Providing anything more gets messy, and
will be used against you.  In cases where I've been an expert witness or
submitted a signed statement, the defense wanted nothing more than a
statement along the lines of, 'This IP address, xxxxx, appears in the
official tor directory at the time of xxx on date xxx with an exit
policy of xxx.'  There are plenty of places in this world where having something
encrypted is the equivalent of putting the data in a locked safe.  You
can be compelled to decrypt the data.  Prosecutors love data.
So far, I believe every tor exit relay operator that has endured a
raid and courts has been found innocent and their computers returned.
I started a list of providers of legal aid,
mostly for tor exit relay operators.

You told torbutton you didn't want to redirect, so it doesn't for the rest of the session.  If you restart firefox/aurora, it should prompt you again on a google captcha. You can also control this behaviour by right clicking torbutton, choosing preferences, going to Security Settings, and clicking the Headers tab.

I think there is a disconnect somewhere in our understanding of what
you're doing. When you say 'private tor network', I take that to mean:
- you are running your own directory authorities
- you are runnning your own tor relays which are configured for your
  directory authorities
- you have configured a client tor to use the directory authorities
None of the above involves Vidalia. Vidalia is a controller for tor
with a subset of functionality available in the torrc configuration
Once you have a tor client configured to talk to your private directory
authorities, then you just simple fire up vidalia and connect to that
tor client. What you see in the Network Map will simply reflect the size
of your private tor network. The tor client is doing the work, vidalia
is just a pretty display of everything.

a safer online experience with Tor. Between renaming "Aurora" to
something more obvious, to a single executable/binary that hides the

towards a 'tor product for the masses'.

These aren't attacks on hidden services. These are attacks on php,

I suspect not. I run many hidden services, all are reachable without

but rather the software behind the service. Time will tell.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Rumors of Tor's compromise 
I keep having the same conversation over and over again with various reporters from various news agencies. I've put up a [blog post]
exaggerated) as our answer.  The content of the blog post is also included # Rumors of Tor's compromise are greatly exaggerated
Recently, there are two stories claiming the Tor network is
compromised. It seems it is easier to get press than to publish research,
work with us on the details, and further, to propose solutions. Our
comments are based upon the same stories you are reading. We have
no insider information.
The first story has been around 'Freedom Hosting' and their
hosting of child abuse materials as exposed by [Anonymous Operation
We're reading the press articles, pastebin urls, and talking
to the same people as you. It appears 'Anonymous'
cracked the Apache/PHP/MySQL setup at Freedom Hosting
and published some, or all, of their users in the
database. These sites happened to be hosted on a [Tor hidden
servce]( Further,
'Anonymous' used an old denial of service
attack on 'Freedom Hosting' known as the
attack. It's a simple resource starvation attack that can be conducted
over low bandwidth, low resource requirement connections to individual
hosts. This isn't an attack on Tor, but rather an attack on some software
behind a Tor hidden service. This attack was discussed in a thread on the
mailing list starting October 19th.
The second story is around Eric Filiol's claims of compromising
the Tor network leading up to his Hackers to Hackers talk in
Brazil in a few days. This was initially announced by some French
press websites; however, it has spread further, such as this [Hackers
Brazil in a few days. This claim was initially announced by some French
websites; however, it has spread further, such as this [Hacker
Again, the
mailing list had the first discussions of these attacks back on October
13th.  To be clear, neither Eric nor his researchers have disclosed
anything about this attack to us. They have not talked to us, nor shared
any data with us — despite some mail exchanges where we reminded him the phrase "responsible disclosure". Here's the attack as we understand
it, from reading the various press reports:
They enumerated 6000 IP addresses that they think
are Tor relays. There aren't that many Tor relays in the world —
[2500]( is a more accurate
number. We're not sure what caused them to overcount so much. Perhaps
they watched the Tor network over a matter of weeks and collected a
bunch of addresses that aren't relays anymore? The set of relays is
public information, so there's no reason to collect a list and no reason
to end up with a wrong list.
One-third of the machines on those IP addresses are vulnerable to
operating system or other system level attacks, meaning he can break
in. That's quite a few! We wonder if that's true with the real Tor
network, or just their simulated one? Even ignoring the question of
what these 3500 extra IP addresses are, it's important to remember that
one-third by number is not at all the same as one-third by capacity:
Tor clients load-balance over relays based on the relay capacity, so
any useful statement should be about how much of the *capacity* of the
Tor network is vulnerable. It would indeed be shocking if one-third of
the Tor network by capacity is vulnerable to external attacks.
(There's also an aside about enumerating bridges. They say they found
181 bridges, and then there's a quote saying they "now have a complete
picture of the topography of Tor", which is a particularly unfortunate
time for that quote since there are currently around 600 bridges running.)
We expect the talk will include discussion about some cool Windows trick
that can modify the crypto keys in a running Tor relay that you have
local system access to; but it's simpler and smarter just to say that
when the attacker has local system access to a Tor relay, the attacker
controls the relay.
Once they've broken into some relays, they do congestion attacks like
[packet spinning]( to congest
the relays they couldn't compromise, to drive users toward the relays
they own. It's unclear how many resources are needed to keep the rest
of the relays continuously occupied long enough to keep the user from
using them. There are probably some better heuristics that clients
can use to distinguish between a loaded relay and an unavailable relay;
we look forward to learning how well their attack here actually worked.
From there, the attack gets vague. The only hint we have is this nonsense
sentence from the article:
  The remaining flow can then be decrypted via a fully method of attack
  called "to clear unknown" based on statistical analysis.
Do they have a new attack on AES, or on OpenSSL's implementation of it,
or on our use of OpenSSL? Or are they instead doing some sort of timing
attack, where if you own the client's first hop and also the destination
you can use statistics to confirm that the two flows are on the same
circuit? There's a history of [confused
researchers]( proclaiming
some sort of novel active attack when passive correlation attacks are much
simpler and just as effective.
So the summary of the attack might be "take control of the nodes you can,
then congest the other ones so your targets avoid them and use the nodes
you control. Then do some unspecified magic crypto attack to defeat the
layers of encryption for later hops in the circuit." But really, these are
just guesses based on the same news articles you're reading. We look
forwarding to finding out if there's actually an attack we can fix,
or if they are just playing all the journalists to get attention.
More generally, there are two broader lessons to remember here. First,
research into anonymity-breaking attacks is how the field moves forward,
and using Tor for your target is [common](
because a) it's resistant to all the simpler attacks and b) we make it
[really easy](
to do your research on. And second, remember that most other anonymity
systems out there fall to these attacks so quickly and thoroughly that
no researchers even talk about it anymore. For some recent examples, see
the single-hop proxy discussions in [How Much Anonymity does Network
Latency Leak?](
and [Website Fingerprinting in Onion Routing Based Anonymization

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor spying 
Yes, as noted, this is old news.  Go back even further in time and you'll see a string of people wanting attention at 'hacker cons' by presenting nothing more than 'i ran wireshark on my exit relay and look what I found! aren't I super hacker cool?' Throwing the words 'tor network' into your presentation or talk title are fine ways to get listed, get press, and pretend you are a super hacker to those who don't know any better.
Moxie however, does have many skills, and doesn't need to pretend.  He ran an exit node with sslstrip enabled, which would essentially phish the users.  From the Forbes story mentioned in your original email, "By hosting the substituted fraud site at an arbitrary HTTPS address and adding a look-alike series of characters to the front of the URL, a user's browser can be tricked into showing all the signs of an HTTPS site."  Say sslstrip replaced  with  with a valid cert for *.ijjk.cn. Many users won't notice the ruse.  They think they have a lock icon, and see  in their URI bar. So clearly, this is the real paypal.
Many of the current browsers display the domain name of the ssl cert in response to these sorts of phishing attacks, so today, the user would see ijjk.cn in the green or blue ssl cert portion and then notice it says  next to it. That should tip you off that something is wrong.
There are far more sophisticated attacks with ssl and phishing around, but almost all of them rely on tricking the unwary user.
The general answer we give about Tor exit nodes is as follows:
Yes, the guy running the exit node can read the bytes that come in and out there. Tor anonymizes the origin of your traffic, and it makes sure to encrypt everything inside the Tor network, but it does not magically encrypt all traffic throughout the Internet.
This is why you should always use end-to-end encryption such as SSL for sensitive Internet connections. (The corollary to this answer is that if you are worried about somebody intercepting your traffic and you're *not* using end-
to-end encryption at the application layer, then something has already gone wrong and you shouldn't be thinking that Tor is the problem.)
Tor does provide a partial solution in a very specific situation, though. When you make a connection to a destination that also runs a Tor relay, Tor will automatically extend your circuit so you exit from that circuit. So for example if Indymedia ran a Tor relay on the same IP address as their website, people using Tor to get to the Indymedia website would automatically exit from their Tor relay, thus getting *better* encryption and authentication properties than just browsing there the normal way. It's not legal, assuming it was run in the US, EU, etc. See  Of course, botnets and phishing aren't legal either, but that hasn't stopped their growth into the tens of millions of infected machines.
For the wikileaks/jacob rumors, we have this answer,   In fact, it's a fine answer for anyone who worries their non-encrypted traffic is traversing the Internet.  We've helped write https everywhere with the EFF to help encrypt the traffic end to end, The recent DigiNotar, Comodo, and possibly other CAs breaks are a different sort of attack.  We don't have all of the details, one of the certs handed out by DigiNotar is *.*.com.  This means   and well, anything .com could be spoofed.  This is unrelated to Tor. However, if a government ran an exit node, and inserted their fake *.*.com certificate into the traffic, how would users know that their credit agency website,  is the real one or not?  Try and call up Experian and ask for their SSL certificate serial number and fingerprint.  I tried. I was routed to security because they thought I hacked their website, see  for more details.
How do you know you're talking to the real torproject.org for that matter?  Well, for starters, we publish our SSL cert fingerprints,  Other than that, how do you know? Current versions of Mozilla and Chrome, and maybe IE9, hard code our ssl cert fingerprint into their browser so if the cert doesn't match, you'll get a warning message.
How far down the rabbit hole shall we go?  Let's start with 'trusting trust' by Ken Thompson and work our way up to the current state of CAs today. Moxie is a smart guy, his answer to the CA issues, and therefore his own sslsniff/sslstrip attack is currently  I think Moxie's on the list, he can reply as well.

This question can likely only be answered by the authorities.  The
obvious attacks are against the webserver itself (apache, IIS, nginx,

don't provide the application or content at the address. You need some

Because encryption is illegal, not ip addresses and port combinations.
At the most basic level, they could just block tcp 443 and probably

deep packet inspection is the next probability to detect and block

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor banned in Pakistan. 
Perhaps I wasn't clear.  Pakistan has banned all encryption on the Internet inside their country.  It is unknown how this will be enforced, if at all. There are at least two ways Pakistan can enforce this ban:
1. Block typical ports for encrypted traffic, such as ssh, https, pop3, and imaps; or
2. Require ISPs to deploy deep packet inspection devices that look for any encrypted traffic.  Once they find encrypted traffic, the ISP can be required to  a. simply record that customer X is using encryption and report that to the government; or
 b. block the traffic. If number 1, Tor clients talking to bridges may still work, assuming the bridge isn't running on a blocked port.
If number 2, Tor clients in situation 2a still get recorded, because on the wire, it looks like someone is using encryption. Tor clients in situation 2b means the client will not connect to the next hop, the bridge in this case.
This is all conjecture as we have no more visibility into the enforcement mechanisms than any one else. We are working on pluggable transports and obfuscating the tor procotol so that we can fool a deep packet inspection device to some level. See  for extremely experimental code.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Blocking Tor - solutions? 
There is no easy, nor good solution right now. A solution that exists is
to run an unpublished exit relay. You then change the tor client to
allow .exit notation and use your private exit relay. I have heard of
some orgs that do this and share their exit relay with their
membership.  They use the normal tor network for everything they can, and then
switch to the private-relay.exit notation when needed. If the exit relay
is discovered (whether through cracking, law enforcement collection,
etc), then it could be much easier to map out who used it. It also may
increase liability because the exit relay operator cannot use the easy
explanation of "it was a public tor exit relay, therefore not my
The private exit relay still doesn't know where the client is in the
world, but not what the client is doing if using ssl and the like. The
org would possibly know what set of humans have access to it.
This is in no way condoning this option, but I'm continually surprised
at the creativity involved by others in using tor.

It's plausible they record all transit through their single internet

This collected information could give them tor clients talking to the
public list of tor relays or known tor bridges. They have deployed a DPI device that can recognize the tor handshake
and are recording the tor client to relay handshake. In both of these cases, they can only identify that you may be using
tor, not what you're doing. Using obfsproxy could defeat both of the above issues.

First off, thanks for running a bridge.  Bridges are divided into at
least four pools in the bridge database. The pools are web, email,
manual and other, effectively. If your bridge was slotted into the
latter two pools, it will take a while to get some users. An
alternative is that your bridge is already blocked in some countries,
such as China, and other users haven't found it yet.

Yes. Your bridge will not be able to talk to the rest of the tor
network, so will remain isolated.
Yes, we believe it is safe, even encouraged for some parts of the
world, such as China, where they are bent on hating the open Internet.

It seems it is easier to get press than to publish research, work with

upon the same stories you are reading. We have no insider information.
The first story has been around 'Freedom Hosting' and their hosting of
child abuse materials as exposed by Anonymous Operation Darknet. We're
reading the press articles, pastebin urls, and talking to the same
people as you. It appears 'Anonymous' cracked the Apache/PHP/MySQL
setup at Freedom Hosting and published some, or all, of their users in
the database. These sites happened to be hosted on a Tor hidden
service. Further, 'Anonymous' used a somewhat recent RAM-exhaustion
denial of service attack on the 'Freedom Hosting' Apache server. It's a
simple resource starvation attack that can be conducted over low
bandwidth, low resource requirement connections to individual hosts.
This isn't an attack on Tor, but rather an attack on some software
behind a Tor hidden service. This attack was discussed in a thread on
the tor-talk mailing list starting October 19th."

Because it's the default engine in firefox. We use the firefox source
code as the base of Tor Browser. Also, the majority of users want
google as their default engine due to the quality of search results. The
secondary default for search engines is DuckDuckGo if Google prompts
for a captcha. We get zero money from Google for search. The only Google money we get is roughly $3000 from
Google Summer of Code for every year we're accepted. Tor/EFF GSoC
students get a separate stipend if accepted, directly from Google.
Instead of theorizing about Tor's funding, look at it directly,
 All non-profit,
501c3 organizations in the US are required to disclose their
financials. If someone tells you they "acquired" tor's financials, it
means they downloaded it off our page or asked us for them directly.
For a bonus, Tor publishes everything about our financials, including
the optional documents such as our audit results and State of
Massachusetts filings.  They are a year behind generally, because it
takes 6-8 months for the auditors to get through everything to their
satisfaction. We expect our 2011 financial statements to be released in

the goal is to get the tor client to connect to the tor network.
Whether the tor client uses a tor bridge, or a proxy server, is mostly

Lack of bandwidth isn't so much the problem. Lack of tcp sockets and cpu
power for onionskins at the relays is the problem. The higher bandwidth
the relay, the worse these two problems become. Exit relays are already overloaded, adding compression overhead will
not make this better. Lots of traffic on the Internet is already compressed between the
client and server. What tor does in the middle is irrelevant. See the
SPDY proposal,
Generally, the tor relays do not want to touch nor modify user traffic
in any way. Once we can detect "compress or not", it's a quick slide
down a slippery slope to "censor or not". See

It's been a while since I relayed phone support experiences. Six months
ago we listed our phone number on the 'contact us' page. See the
experiences of the first month or so at 'talking to users',
There have been a few tweaks and changes to the live/phone support. It
is still free, but it is clear there is a demand for paid support and
consulting. The notable changes are adding jitsi for supporting otr and
zrtp-encrypted voip and video chats. Jitsi also works for anything
xmpp-based, such as google chat and voice. Also, publishing 'office
hours' for the world concentrates the calls to predictable hours.
We also setup a ticketing system to track email support requests.
tl;dr, users call, have questions, some calls are short, some calls are
long. maybe we should offer a paid support option.
First, the phone support FAQ list:
1. What is Aurora?
2. Why is Tor slower than x (vpn, proxy, native internet, psiphon, etc)?
3. Why is running a bridge/relay so complex? I want to help people, not
get a degree in computer science.
4. I want watch videos on the internet, how do I do this?
4a. Ok, not in tbb. How do I configure safari/chrome/ie/opera to use
tor so I can watch videos on the internet?
4b. why is this self-configuration so complex?
5. My anti-virus/anti-malware/spyware-detector tells me tor.exe and
vidalia.exe are unknown and unsafe. what do I do?
6. Can you explain to me online privacy and anonymity and how tor helps
make these happen?
Second, there are three calls that stand out over the past six months.
The first is actually not a single call, but a series of them.
'I'm an (animal rights or religious rights) supporter going to a
repressive Asian country to spread my message and take some actions.
Can you help me be anonymous online while traveling?' There are apparently some organized groups going somewhere in Asia
to do something. They eventually find Tor through search engines
and their fellow members and want to learn more. These calls are
generally 30-50 minutes long and generally wind up talking about how
the Internet works more than tor itself. There have been eight of these
calls so far.
The second was a series of calls from one woman. She called out of
desperation. She figured tor is 'technical and computery' and may be
able to help, since the local computer stores and police dept were
useless. She said her computer would randomly do things she didn't tell
it to do, like move the cursor, turn the webcam light on, and one of
her coworkers in another country seemed to know far more about her than
she remembers telling him over the years. The local computer stores ran anti-virus/anti-malware and found
nothing. One suggested she see a doctor for dementia (she's
older). The local police told her to take classes to learn how to use
her computer and even if her coworker was stalking her, he's in a
different country and therefore out of their jurisdiction. I was the
first to tell her she's not crazy and yes, infected computers can do
exactly what she's experiencing. After about 5 calls over two weeks, I
eventually handed her off to a local domestic violence organization who
can also help with internet stalking. It's surprisingly hard to find an
anti-abuse org that also knows how to handle the Internet. Comically,
the first two orgs I called pointed me at NNEDV.org, who then point
people at Tor for help with privacy online.
And the final call was my first video support chat. This person is an
adult video performer, and as she put it, 'there are fans, super fans,
creepy fans, and stalkers. I love the first three types of fans.'
The local police detective basically told her that because of what she
does for a living, there is nothing they can do about her stalker and
that she brought this on herself. She found tor through internet
searches. She talked to other companies who just wanted to sell her
software, but not actually answer her questions. She had a lot of
We covered online privacy, how the internet works, how to un-infect
her work computer, and how to keep her personal computer safer than the
work computer. Generally helped her setup tails on a usb drive,
tbb, and what happens when you login to google, twitter, and facebook
over tor (who does that provide privacy from, what does it protect,
etc). She wanted to know how to keep, in her words, 'the public me
separate from the private me' on the Internet and from her non-stalker
fans. In the end, she said the internet was far more complex than she
thought, and wishes she could just buy something that 'just worked'
without her thinking about it. She realized it's unlikely that will
ever happen.
In summary, there are the usual 5-10 minute calls/chats about technical
operations of tor, and then the far longer 'explain to me online
privacy and anonymity' calls. And yes, there are still the random crazy people that call and insist
they are being stalked by the Illuminati, The Greys, and other
intergalactic networks asking if tor can provide planetary anonymity or
anonymity on space networks. Thankfully, these are few and far between.

I don't have a definitive answer, but here are my proto-thoughts,
likely yes. This answer is based on support calls and tickets. It seems
most anti-virus/anti-malware providers include some software that
intercepts and/or replaces 'localhost'. Their software generally does
one of two things: 1. scans for known malware/virus patterns locally, with this scan
database updated periodically;
2. intercepts and relays the traffic to a 'cloud' somewhere which
records lots of information about the user (ip address, program name,
timestamp, registration or serial number) and stuff all of this into a
database. Over time, they get to learn a whole lot about your computer
usage and build a fantastic profile of it. I've seen documents,
executables, etc sent to the 'cloud' too, scanned, and returned to the
user. What they do with all of that data is unknown. My first thought
when working with a user and ESET scanner was 'who needs spyware, you
paid for your spying to boot'.
The typical support call is when the user's A-V system prompts them
with 'start-tor-browser.exe' is of unknown safety. do you really want
to run this?'  It then repeats that question for tor.exe and
vidalia.exe.  It seems when you click on some link for 'unsafe' or
'check the cloud', you go to the vendor's website and by default opt-in
to upload the aforementioned data.
If enough people tell the 'cloud' that the tor-related executables are
safe, it crosses some threshold and all 'cloud subscribers' no longer
get the warnings. However, every time there is a new tor release, the
cycle of approval starts anew.
All of this is gathered from working with users. A fine bit of data
privacy research may be to figure out what A-V companies are collecting
from your computer and storing.
