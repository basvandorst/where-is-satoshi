@_subject: Slashdot banning Tor? 
I've been seeing this message when I try to login to slashdot.org:
"This IP address or network has been used to abuse the system and logins
from it have been disabled. If you feel that this is unwarranted, feel
free to include your IP address (194.25.9.105) in the subject of an
email to banned at slashdot.org, and we will examine why there is a ban. If
you fail to include the IP address (again, in the subject!), then your
message will be deleted and ignored. I mean come on, we're good, we're
not psychic."
I get the same message when I go through other exit nodes too.  Anyone
else seeing this?  Has anyone tried contacting them?

@_subject: Can't connect through proxy 
Tor 0.1.0.10 under WinXP.  It was working fine until our network was
changed to send all traffic through a proxy.  I opened up torrc and
added lines for FacistFirewall and HttpProxy.  But here is the output
from notice.log:
Jun 24 13:55:56.551 [notice] Tried for 60 seconds to get a connection to
[scrubbed]:80. Giving up.
The output from debug.log starts here:

This behaviour is consistant with every site I try to connect with.
Privoxy always puts up a 404 page.  Any suggestions on where to look for
the cause of this problem?  Is there something more I should be setting
in torrc?
OBTW, the SwitchProxy extension to Firefox really comes in handy during
sessions like this.

@_subject: Can't connect through proxy 
No joy.  I added an HttpsProxy line and got the same results.  I
experimented with going through the proxy directly and found that it
expects all traffic to go through port 80.  So I next tried
  HttpProxy proxy.foo.com:80
  HttpsProxy proxy.foo.com:80
and that didn't work either.  What should I try next?

I don't know.  If this is a problem with authentication are there
particular log messages I should be looking for?
