You are doing nothing wrong. We just have not had the time yet to adapt
our test to all TBB settings. Sorry, if that did confuse you. We try to
fix this as soon as possible.
The test gets the values purely with CSS and disabling that is hardly an
option. There is currently no way to avoid that other than patching the
Firefox source. It is already on Mike's ever-growing ToDo list. See:

If you hover over the link, e.g. in the rating column you see how it is
composed: headers you sent AND the order of them are collected and
hashed. BTW: I just downloaded the latest Linux bundle I could find and
the test values seem quite fine (the Cache field should not be red but
that is an issue we still need to fix). The Torbrowser signature should
be aadd98ca8e50a5e29de9fe4b819197d1.
Yes, it should.
I am not sure what you mean but in the header signature are not all
headers included you send just the amount that is needed to distinguish
different browsers. Thus, you can have the same header signature but
still do not send the same headers.

I am actually not sure if there is something to improve at the moment at
all. That would imply that there is an official HTTP header
normalization for the TBB. But that is not the case. What we did was
taking the en-TBB and its values as reference values as we thought that
this bundle would be our best bet for the largest TBB user group. That
might be a wrong assumption, though.

Yes, you should inform your users that Dooble (and thus your TorBrowser
clone) has serious proxy bypass issues which make the inclusion of Tor

They are using FoxyProxy, right? Let's assume the PirateBrowser folks
did not deactivate update checks. Then, there should be a similar spike
visible on AMO where FoxyProxy is hosted. But there is no such spike in
the FoxyProxy user statistics.

Works for me. It would be interesting to know whether that only happens
with the official builds or with ln5's or gk's builds as well (I could
not access mike's due to permission issues)...

Works both on my 64bit and 32bit testing systems. Do you see error
messages in the error console (CTRL + SHIFT + J) that could be related?

Well, of course, you can resize the window as much as you like. But then
you probably loose the benefit of having the same browser window size as
many other users.

Not yet, alas.
Interesting. And this holds for the original Ubuntu Unity bug report as
