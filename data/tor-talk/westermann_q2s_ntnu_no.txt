@_subject: What about private & Public Keys 
If an attacker compromises the private keys of an OR, he can
authenticate himself as the OR during the TLS and the circuit
establishment process. Consequently, the attacker could read and decrypt
traffic by mounting a man in the middle attack.
Due to the property of perfect forward secrecy it can only affect
connections that are established after the key was compromised. All
connections prior to this event are still protected due to the property
of the used DH key exchange protocol [1]. To answer your other question:
Yes, it has advantages. Tor has this concept of long term key, mid term key, and short term key
(see section 1.1 of the Tor spec [2]). The short term key should be
rotated at least once a day according to the spec. However, I'm not sure
in which interval Tor changes the mid term key and long term key
respectively. Anyway, once the computer is compromised, changing the
keys is more or less meaningless. [1] To unsubscribe, send an e-mail to majordomo at torproject.org with

I think you are looking for:
see Section 5.4 in the control protocol [1] specification for details.

The anonymity test of Jondonym ( does this. They
embed a link-element to a css stylesheet:
link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
I don't know if the android browser follows such kind of links, but it's
worth a try if not done yet.

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor using SSH 
Your machine, running a Tor client, initiates a connection to a machine
on port 22. This is your situation as I understood it.
All of the mentioned IPs are IPs of Tor nodes and all of them announcing
port 22 as a listen port, e.g.,  Amunet9, a Tor router, accepts
connections on port 22 and 80. By searching for one of the mentioned IP
addresses at  , you can
verify this. The traffic to port 22 is most likely Tor traffic and is therefore
normal behavior.
You can also download a list of current Tor nodes, but this list changes
regularly (once an hour). You find a list here:
Probably, you only need to whitelist the guard nodes, but the mentioned
list does not distinguish between the different types of nodes.
