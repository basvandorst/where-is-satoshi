You do realize that it is completely common for "looking" at them to
take months.
This is a big thing to people in this community, because the police
will happily come and confiscate the tools you need to do your job,
and not return them for months, years, or sometimes even ever, even
in cases where it seems fairly straightforward to identify that the
person has done nothing wrong.  The police, and many of the policies
surrounding this issue, often assume that the party is guilty, and
also assume that seizure isn't a significant professional issue.
