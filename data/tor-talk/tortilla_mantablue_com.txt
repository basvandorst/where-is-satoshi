I tried in Linux after an auto-update:
8.0a9 (based on Mozilla Firefox 60.1.0esr) (64-bit)
I got the same warning on check.torproject.org that I'm not using Tor
Browser.  I would guess it might be an altered signature (user agent or
accept languages or other?)

You only replied to me, so I'm re-involving the list.
re: point (B) check.torproject.org doesn't look at your browser's
configuration settings - it can't inspect that kind of thing.  It's just
looking at the user agent string your browser sends *as a result of* how
that setting is set.  How it got that way is another question.
