@_subject: port scanning increase 
HI All
When I started my tor server the amount of port scans with from 1 every 5 sec to 2 /sec.  But the scans are not the standard probed ports, but ports that don't have any standard services.  25112,6883,9182,20341,....  and  traceroute packets. Is this standard?  If so thats spooky.
