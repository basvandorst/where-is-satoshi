In order to design secure code, especially when we are dealing with a large code base (like an OS), unit testing and manual review are unrealistic.  A better approach is to develop a system of classifiers and train them against every possible category of error.  We then submit our codebase to this classifier system and it generates a report indicating (with certain probabilities in complex scenarios) where the errors are.  This is then published for everyone to see in the case of open source software.  Each potential error is then reviewed, tested and submitted to the classifiers for reanalysis until given a clean bill of health.
To get an even better result from the classifiers, we would attempt to execute the code on particular chips or particular series of chips.  This will reveal errors in computation/data transfer at the hardware level.  This process is complex because we must use random sampling of given chips due to manufacturing variations.  To become ultra secure and robust, we would expose the hardware to radiation, both electromagnetic and nuclear, to emulate jamming/remote manipulation and cosmic rays.  The classifiers would reveal what form of errors occurred and how they were handled.  Emulating remote manipulation by radio is the most complex aspect.  Each wire inside a PC or device is effectively an antenna and typical shielding can be penetrated by a variety of means remotely.  Thus it becomes possible to address the board and chips at the level of each wire or logic gate and inject code.  This can cause a wide variety of issues and would normally be conducted by a sophisticated AI.
Then, we also have the reverse of this issue which I am sure everyone has heard of under the general banner of TEMPEST.  This is general EM noise that can leak into the environment through everything from emitted EM to electrically coupled devices, power, data or telephone cables.  There is also a more active version that uses the reflection of radar to determine the binary signal on any given wire.  This noise is analysed by classifiers and the data and processing is reconstructed, hence the focus on processing encrypted data.  It requires extensive engineering to minimise the leakage.  I would need to run the numbers, but offhand I think that the emissions from a even a smartphone can be captured and reconstructed from LEO.
So, this is a very complex area.  If you are serious about IT security, then you must attempt to design software and hardware that can match current espionage capability.  Any weakness will be exploited, regardless of how unlikely you think that would be to occur.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Partial View Traffic Analysis 
I've been working on some theories I have in regards to isolating traffic to particular regions using only partial views.  It should be possible to capture timing information based upon requests made by a logged on user to a website or hidden service (such as requests for js, or css files).
This would provide us with a general location of a user with a certain degree of probability.
Two major aspects control the resolution:
1.  The size and density of a given botnet.
2.  The number of timing profiles obtained.
We could also change the geographic location of the hidden service periodically, to increase the resolution further.  This is a highly cost effective attack against TOR and does not require the resources of a government to conduct either.
Has anyone else investigated this approach?  If so, what were your results?

With all the recent crack downs on civil liberties, seizure of TOR services and general censorship that is now hitting even mainstream search engines, I would like to propose a set of new services and some enhancements to the network layer to improve anonymity.  We need to get as much support as possible behind these services and improvements as they will assist in both the expansion and self-funding capability of TOR going forward.
The following services have been suggested and will require a fee, paid in Bitcoins, which will be donated to the TOR project.  This is a security measure to prevent saturation of the services.  These services should be integrated into the TOR software and run in a distributed fashion.
1.  Distributed Web Hosting
Currently, anyone hosting a hidden service must provide their own hosting solution and use software to provide access to the TOR network.  This strategy has seen increasing number of services taken down in raids by various governments.  We require a distributed hosting solution that provides a web server and database to anyone.  The requirements for the service are as follows:
a.  Payment gateway that accepts Bitcoins and either generates a new site, or renews a previously generated private key.  This gateway should retain no knowledge of any transaction, or the ability to revoke a site once generated.  Sites should automatically expire after a given date, unless the private key is renewed.  Private key renewals should not require the private key to leave the client-side.
b.  Sites can be hosted at any node in an encrypted server with redundancy options (whack-a-mole) and automatic replication between nodes.  No node should be able to inspect what it hosts in any fashion.  A premium can be paid to increase replication times.
c.  Should provide a set minimum of traffic capacity, a premium can be paid to increase that capacity or link sites to build a larger service (i.e. multiple front-ends, database clusters).  A Bitcoin pool should be created that providers of this service can be paid from to compensated for the increased processing.
2.  Distributed File Hosting
Follows the same structure as web hosting, but provides an FTP service.  Should integrate into the web hosting layer seamlessly.
3.  Distributed Virtual Machine Hosting
Follows the same structure as web hosting, but provides a complete virtual OpenBSD/Linux platform.  A Bitcoin pool should be created that providers of this service can be paid from to compensated for the increased processing.
4.  Distributed Web Indexer
Uncensored search of the entire internet.  Speed is unimportant, as is the frequency of updates.  The primary goal is to make it uncensored.
5.  Distributed Email and Instant Messaging
Accounts can be purchased for Bitcoins, completely decentralized.  Speed of delivery is unimportant and should be a best effort system.  The inclusion of a "global broadcast" for a premium is recommended.  This latter services allows for important announcements to be flashed across the world.  The premium should be set very high to prevent abuse.
6.  Distributed News Service
Pay a premium and post your story.  This will ensure only important news hits this newswire.
7.  Distributed Start Page and TOR Index
TOR needs an entry point, somewhere that provides access to all services and can guide users through the system.  Many sites have tried to serve this function, none have survived.
Enhancements To TOR
The UK government has instructed GCHQ to dismantle TOR and it is known that Sybil attacks are underway that allow metadata analysis of traffic that can expose the source of traffic based upon statistical processes.  As such, we require an update to the underlying network layer of TOR that obfuscates any attempt at traffic analysis.
The following is recommended:
1.  Packet padding to fixed lengths
2.  Fake Packets
3.  Packet timing jitter
4.  Random rotation of cipher schemes between links
This will assist in eliminating the global view issue.
Any suggestions, modifications, comments or constructive criticism is very welcome.

In an ideal world, there would be no payment system.  In the world as it
 is today, we must deal with both abuse of a system and the realities of
 the costs of operating a system.  In respect to the latter, we cannot live in some hippy freeloader universe.
In regards to 1c, you felt it was a type of net neutrality.  No, that is wrong.  Think of it more like the difference between shared and dedicated hosting.
The payment gateway would also be distributed.
The file hosting discussed on deals with ftp-like services.  If a need is shows for other types of file hosting, it can be added, but we should focus on core services first.
Not until you mention it.  This solution looks viable and should be re-written and absorbed into the default install of TOR.
Its not about selling, its is about preventing the abuse of resources and ensuring anything that requires servers can scale with the user base rather than being contested.
TORChat solves the instant messaging issue and should be bundled.  Now we need a distributed email system.
It would be a token amount, its just to prevent spam mainly.
I understand that, I'm thinking of an automated directory similar to TORDir where you manually add services and ones that fail a given number of checks get pruned from the system.
Creating a hidden service to act as a start page, or gateway, for users has been tried time-and-time again.  Look at core.onion, gone in a flash.  We require something more robust.

In a distributed system there are finite resources.  Only so many web sites, file hosting sites, VM's, can be hosted at any one point in time.  It would be easy to consume these resources on a free system.  By billing for them, it would cost a lot of money to perform this kind of attack.
I completely agree.  There would be no mechanism for this.  All that payment gateway does is take payment, request that a new hosting site be provides, present the credentials to the user.  The expiry of the hosting service would be a done within the hosting software and is just a countdown to a specific date, or lack of use.
Certainly, but it means that the consumption of resources on TOR is sustainable.  That is, there will be enough funds available to invest in additional hardware and expand the network.
The implementation of this service would preserve this and actually make it a lot easier and more secure.  The feds could not shut down a HS once launched.  There is no gatekeeper and existing tools to host hidden services would still be provided.
When websites, databases and users start consuming resources this model would be unsustainable.  There are costs associated with providing the necessary hardware and scaling the services.  You are, of course, welcome to pay those costs yourself but I do feel that is not supporting those who help provide the TOR infrastructure.
I am not asking that anyone aim for making a profit from this payment system, just that the funds are used to expand the service and ensure that it scales well.
That does not really make sense.  Let's say I run a site that gets 100 visits a day and someone else runs a site that gets 1 million visits a day.  Both of these services require different architectures and supporting hardware resources to operate.  In a distributed platform, is it fair to ask users to host a solution to accept 1 million users without assisting towards the cost of that hosting solution?  Is such a model sustainable?  Ideals and goals are great, but there is also a reality, the hardware costs money.
Given that this reality exists and those who operate nodes have limited financial resources, how could we ever hope to scale the system on good will alone.  I am not seeking to dispose of the current architecture, merely provide an alternative that will allow for rapid sustainable expansion.
I do agree on this point.  That said, what are the long term implications of this given the structure?  Very little from a practical viewpoint, we just see an expansion of the system and better services with a variety of secure options.  What we get is greater choice.
I have some experience in writing distributed filesystems on highly scalable networks.  I actually have some functional software for windows at present.  I would just need to add encryption and an access interface.  It should not be too difficult to implement.
For distributed VM's, it should not be too different to website hosting.  I could leverage existing tools such OpenStack or KVM.  The tricky part will be creating a management interface.  It is highly workable.
It is based on java and I'm not sure about the way the indexer works.  I would prefer a java-less solution if possible for security reasons.  If the solution can scale to millions of nodes and not require everyone to download a complete copy of the index, then it will be a simple port.
There is another thread on this list talking about a distributed email system in development, so it looks like there may be a solution in the works.  I'll keep an eye on it.
I find when people need to part with cash, they tend to be very shy. :)
The distributed services require an interface of some form and bundling it all together into some start page, or gateway, with a few other services sounds like a good idea.  It also helps new users find their feet on the network and branch out.

I've seen the proposal for default encryption already be watered down to "if available" from mandatory.  The IETF has a long history of watering down security protocols (WEP anyone?) and is driven mainly by corporate interest...the same guys causing all the problems by failing to stand up for end-users rights.
Something does not smell right here.  Ultimately, this is a power play, one that assumes control of TOR and places it in the hands of corporations and their custom implementations.  All of which are subject to national security letters and degrees of cooperation.  So, this is about backdooring TOR, nothing else.
That alone, at least to me, indicates that the IETF is pretty much NSA, or representing their interests.  I wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw them.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Risk of selectively enabling JavaScript 
Javascript, by itself, is not an issue and poses no more of a security threat than any other type of data transferred online.  Coding errors in image handling, html parsing, ftp, etc., can all be used to inject code.  The idea that you are gaining some security or increased anonymity by disabling javascript is outright nonsense.  As TBB is a standard product, its fingerprint should be the same for everyone.
The fact that TBB disables javascript is a testimony to how bad the javascript coders of Firefox are.  I think an investigation is warranted that highlights the particular developers at Mozilla who have introduced bugs into javascript handling.  Then get rid of them as a security precaution.  I am quite confident that we would trace this to a small number of individuals in that team.  I have concerns that Mozilla has not already adopted this approach.
I think there is a solid argument for adding filters to the exit nodes that strip anything that could be used against a person and enforce default headers ,etc.  This will kill any fingerprinting, injection and tracking attempts.  If anyone still requires full non-modified access, they should be forced to explicitly allow that by clicking a button.
That said, all of this is a complete waste of time if Tor does not start integrating techniques to prevent traffic analysis.

The idea of edge filtering ensures that clients are not exposed to exploits.  It is a defense-in-depth strategy.  It does not replace any client-side measure, it adds to it.
When a stream leave an exist node to request a clearweb, non-encrypted page, there is an opportunity to strip potentially harmful aspects from the returned resource.  This should be the default behavior.  With requests to non-encrypted content there exists the ability to place additional values in the packet that indicate this should be disabled.
Its not really difficult and not applicable to end-to-end tls connections.

Do we have any empirical figures on this across browsers?
Zero days can appear anywhere where data is transferred and code is incorrect.  If we are advising that JS should be disabled, we are making a statement about the quality of code in Firefox.  We may also be saying that the security services are sabotaging the product, but let's get some figures and name of responsible devs first.
Really???  I thought it was disabled in the latest betas.  Anyway, it doesn't change the argument since the recommended practice is to disable it.
There is because not everyone uses TBB.  It solves problems before they can become problems.
It would kill most of them by making all clients look the same since any exposed data is faked at the exit node.  That reduces the footprint and all we need to be concerned with a malicious exit nodes.
The idea behind defense-in-depth is that we continuously reduce the footprint and attack vectors systematically increasing the dollar value of any functional attack.  It is not a silver bullet approach.
Tor needs strategies for every form of attack.  If not, the entire platform becomes a waste of time.  The broad public perception will develop that the weakness are due to US government influence in the project.
That will be the end for Tor.

This particular issue of SSL/TLS has been known since the earliest days.  It is a well understood problem in authentication.  How do we know a machine or user is who they claim to be?
The solution was the use of a 3rd party to act as a verifier of identity or a trusted party.  This little fact is lost on most new-comers but was a big selling point for groups such as Verisign in the early years.  We ended up with a certificate-based chain of trust.  It has always been understood that if the private keys of the issuing CA, or the root CA, were exposed then it would be trivial to mount man-in-the-middle attacks.  In these times of National Security letters, we can be quite confident that the private keys were obtained a long time ago.
Where private keys could not be obtained, then the practice and policy was to support technologies that were weakened in some fashion and push them as the de-facto standard.  We have seen this in particular modifications to random number generators.
What this means is that your average SSL/TLS connection will be secure from criminals but not from government agencies.  In a world were government agencies are the primary source of industrial espionage this is mainly the concern of businesses and corporations that must protect privileged or confidential information.
In regards to identifying Tor users, this is more simple than anyone imagines.  A simple DB at an ISP recording IP addresses of those connecting to Tor nodes is all it takes.  In fact, the EU mandates that this data be held for 2 years:
That data can be correlated with access to hidden services and other websites, so we know for a fact that Tor is extensively compromised at present and provides no anonymity as it fails to deal with traffic analysis.

Yes, it is.
Certainly, but for anyone not supplying Tor entry nodes, which would be the majority of users, it is all it takes.
At a technical level, it is a two part system.  We have the unclassified system which records user's IP addresses.  Then we have the classified system (i.e. PRISM, Warrentless wiretaps, etc) which records which servers connections are made to.  When combined, this satisfies the EU mandate which as can be seen requires that "destinations" be recorded.
This is then combined with similar info from other nations providing a complete overview of connections.  When we add the "full take", they can then replay every data exchange.  When you add the crypto breaks, well...I think you can see where this is going...
They're crafty fuckers that way.  The know the public would never accept it.  The idea is to break it up into components so that seeing the big picture is difficult and speculative.  But its complete.
No, its not.  Traffic obfuscation techniques can eliminate the global view.  It just needs to be implemented correctly.

It can be argued that email and voip are merely abstractions of a packet switched transfer.  You can bet your last dollar that the interpretation used by the government applies to all forms of communications.
Traffic analysis is based on the statistical analysis of the differences at the physical layer.  We eliminate the differences to the point where no one can tell fake connections from real connections.  It is trivial to implement.

That's a very selective reading and I don't particularly care what you think.  For the record, this is what was stated:
"Basically, I keep a track of site numbers year-on-year, site availability from 3rd party monitoring and read comments on forums and chat.  From what I can gather, most of these sites were suspected of being honeypots due to their tendency to remove anything rape/violence related.  That is, they appeared sanitised in some way.  Then all of sudden, they started disappearing.  Some were connected with major busts of hosting providers, others without any indication what happened."

You must be living in a fantasy land.  The problem still remains, Tor is vulnerable to a global view and that global view exists according to Snowden.

I was doing anonymous  socks proxy chaining long before Tor was around, so I am well versed in the issues.  I agree that it has been stated from the very outset that Tor was vulnerable to a global view.  With respect to hidden services, the key problem is that hidden services' and end user's traffic whilst encrypted can be correlated.  Thus, discovering the location of a hidden service becomes rather trivial as well as discovering an end user.  My main issue is that you guys know this.  Not only that, but you are well aware that this global view exists thanks to Snowden.  Further, it would have been incredibly stupid not to assume that intelligence agencies with billion dollar budgets, very little ethics and Internal security agreements (i.e NATO, UN, etc) would have such an infrastructure.  You need to see the networks in these nations not as being independent, but an interwoven system that all reports back to the US.
Eliminating this correlation attack is trivial.  The attack is dependent on having visibility at both ends.  One at the users end (perhaps ISP) and one near the hidden service (perhaps exchange).  It doesn't take much to match these two together (like multiple nations sharing intelligence data).  One simple attack is just to flood the hidden service with connections and note where traffic spikes.
So, the simple solution is to distribute hidden services within Tor, so that class of attack will fail.  There are no servers in a data center to expose because it is everywhere and no one can tell, just by examining the flow of encrypted packets, who was looking at what.
Now, I know there are a wide range of additional methods to expose users and the majority are beyond your direct control, but this type of attack is something within your control.
I hope you can see where the suspicion arises that this is a deliberate weakness and that being funded by the US military does not inspire confidence that your claims of ignorance are any more than US government propaganda.  Especially, when key aspects of your reply are little more than Fud.

Traffic analysis depends on visibility.  Tor attempts to obfuscate the source of a connection by proxying packets through a network, or chain, of systems.  If an attacker has visibility of the entire process, or even just two ends of that communication, then a range of information can be inferred.
To make an inference requires relating two or more distinct pieces of information (data points).  To undermine traffic analysis (counter-traffic analysis), or any form of analysis, we must first reduce the number of available pieces of information to just one (a single data point).
Hosting sites internally within Tor does exactly that, when it comes to a correlation attack.  The government has only one piece of the puzzle, that your machine sent a packet.  They need a second piece (i.e. where that packet went) in order to infer that you were looking at a particular hidden service.  Then they need additional information of what that site was in order to infer what you were looking at.  So, what we can see here is that for each inference we require an additional piece of information (data point).
Thus, if you want to understand the level of potential exposure of any software, be it Tor or Freenet (etc), then quantify the information (data points) available and what inferences can be made from them.  Then annoy the hell out of the developers until they eliminate each data point.

What you are seeking a full design for a distributed Web Hosting platform within Tor.  Let's see...
We can use the existing mechanisms for hidden services, but rather than directing packets to/from a externally hosted site, we direct the packets internally within onion land.  On an initial page request, packets are directed to a random node on Tor network to find the first portion of the page.  That node then selects another random node to deliver the next portion.  This process repeats until all content is delivered to the client.
There are are a number of important elements in this design:  1.  "Page/Content/Media portions" can be migrated anywhere in the network randomly.  This is an automated system.  2.  The network forgets content/media not access for a long time.
3.  Migrations should look no different than regular connections
4.  There is no way to query the location of "Page/Content/Media portions" (that is internal to the network)
5.  No optimisation should be made for geographic delivery
6.  Uploads are shredded and delivered to different nodes (network migrates them)
7.  All data is encrypted before upload. (route through decryption nodes when properly accessed as a .onion address)
8.  Encryption keys are regularly changed
9.  Multiple copies of each site improving availability.
10.  Using hashes, remove duplicates of pages/content/media (instead share the same resource as a link/reference)
That would be the basics of it.  It needs fully fleshed out but to the end user it would be a CPanel like interface and a standard website with DB support.
I'll see about expanding on this.

Except that we know that such an attack is underway through PRISM and that no one made any moves to fix it.
How long has it been now???  A year???
By any measure I am sure we can call that material assistance.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Questions about NSA monitoring of Tor users. 
I can answer this:
1.  The IP addresses can be connected to an ISP and physical address should the need arise.  It allows the NSA to "rewind the tape" so to speak.  That is why there has been a push for data retention at ISPs.  Given that in the EU governments are seeking 2 years, it would indicate that the platform can rewind internet activity for at least that long.
2.  Tor is a communications platform, the NSA's job is to monitor communications and intercept military planning that effects either itself or its partners.  Secure global communications and computing is now a commodity, whereas it was mainly a state-only capability.  Thus, the average user is now coming up against intelligence agencies, rather than state actors alone.  Leaving blind spots would be dangerous to national security as it provides opportunities for planning and coordination.  So, there is a legitimate case here and no one denies it.  The real problem is that in the absence of a genuine international threat and by that I mean someone on the scale of Russia/China, these systems are being directed against groups with limited capabilities.  Those groups are now being defined as national security threats to justify budgets and to filter money into particular black projects.  Revelations by Snowden and other releases are merely a distraction to where the money is really going.  Did no one notice trillions are being drained from the US economy into some unidentified military project for the last decade or more???
It would seem to indicate that there is a Manhatten-style project underway.

With the US military it is a case of take your pick, from hypersonic delivery systems and satellite laser shields, to brain scanning and strong AIs, I suppose any one or all of them could qualify.
Take a look at the US federal debt, even though the wars have been winding down, borrowing has increased exponentially: Trillions are going somewhere, so whatever it is, it is big and they are willing to undermine the financial health of the nation to deliver it.

I have been examining the number of what would normally be deemed as illegal sites sites on Tor.  Eliminating the narcotics trade, as these tend to be intelligence agency backed enterprises, a serious decline has been noted across the board.
This would tend to suggest that exposure is common place and users no longer feel safe.  In the more serious categories, such as child porn and violent sexual material, no functioning open sites remain and many of the sites that require registration are crippled.  The entire planet has been scrubbed.
This, it would seem, indicates that Tor has been compromised on a global scale with very little fanfare or moves to correct the situation.
Does anyone have any insights into the problem?

Basically, I keep a track of site numbers year-on-year, site availability from 3rd party monitoring and read comments on forums and chat.  From what I can gather, most of these sites were suspected of being honeypots due to their tendency to remove anything rape/violence related.  That is, they appeared sanitised in some way.  Then all of sudden, they started disappearing.  Some were connected with major busts of hosting providers, others without any indication what happened.
Whilst it may be good in some sense, it states that Tor is failing in its primary task of promoting freedom through anonymity.  In fact, it would seem that Tor is having the opposite effect, silencing everyone through fear.  Certainly, some of this comes down to poor security practices, but that cannot explain the scale of what has happened.  So, the question remains, what is wrong with the Anonymity and Security of Tor?  The software is compromised in some fashion and we need to understand this.

The involvement of spooks in the drugs trade is off-topic, but it is something that is well known and documented.  Take a look around Youtube and Google, you will find thousands of reports.  There is even a Wikipedia entry documenting some of this:
The fact is, given the scale of modern international security, no can transport large amounts of narcotics with the direct assistance of an intelligence agency.  These guys are the defacto controllers of all world distribution channels.
The money is used to fund things that they can't ask government for, or things that need to be off the books.  In a lot of cases, it is a mutual relationship with suppliers to ensure support for other agendas or to gain access to particular areas.  So, the line between drug barons and intelligence agencies is highly fuzzy at best, at worst, non-existent.
Anyway, this is off-topic, so I won't be delving into this any further.

Basically put, if criminals cannot evade capture, how can anyone with important information to release evade capture?
Especially when they are the greater threat and more resources can be used against them.  The presence of criminal behaviour, enterprises and activity is a 'canary in a cage' that indicates the overall effectiveness of the Tor platform.
The canary is dead.  Something is wrong with Tor and we need to find it.

Hidden hosting and general usage of Tor are, in functional terms, the same thing.  I remember the issue with Freedom hosting, but that is long ago now and this downward trend is still continuing.  So, no, I am not buying that this is a product of people being spooked.  Many of these sites arrived or remained even after the Freedom Hosting bust.
I think everyone needs to stop looking for excuses and start examining why this is happening and fix it.  Otherwise, this project is a waste of time.

Well, I think this is settling down into a proper discussion.  Whilst the hypothesis is untested, leveraging illegal activity, especially reviled illegal activity, as a metric for the quality of anonymity and security provided by Tor is a sound strategy.
As mentioned before, the 'canary' is dead and we need to understand why.  Given that this is a global phenomenon, then we need to examine the factors that effect this group.  The primary factor would be the software itself.  A secondary factor would be the law, but this is not a consistent factor across the world.
What other consistent factors are there?

We also need to consider that some unidentified flaws exist in the code, but I agree with you traffic analysis is certainly the major problem at present.  Traffic obfuscation will not work against the NSA and it would cause problems with the network.
The only option is to offer hosting within the Tor network itself.  Such hosting would need to be fragmented/distributed, or we could be exposing Tor providers to prosecution.  That is, pages and backend access are delivered by composing them from multiple random nodes.  It would probably best to start with Nginx or Apache and then modify it.  That's a complex design, but robust and the traffic analysis would yield little-to-no actionable information.
Does anyone have any other ideas?

I understand everyone's feelings here and tempers can run hot.  Firstly, not everyone in the US government supports the current behaviour, its a minority in senior positions.  The rest are just following orders although some of them need to get a backbone and remember the oath they have taken and what their nation stands for.
Right now we have a situation where National Security concerns are trumping everything and that is certainly not the basis for a free world.  I don't know about the rest of you, but I'd rather face the enemy than hide like a coward jumping at every shadow.  I grew up with terrorism and the cold war, with the very distinct possibility of dying.  I rather run the risk of been blown to pieces, or shot, than support a stasi-like spy state that will protect me.  Throwing away freedom to safe-guard against possible threats is no way to go through life, in the end, it means you have lost your nation.  It means you did the enemy's work, which is by any measure a form treason.
Anyway, we have a simple solution to this global view and hidden services.  We just implement a distributed hosting solution within the Tor system and end-to-end visibility is gone.

I work with big data analytics, implementing traffic analysis and pinpointing the location of servers is a trivial task given a global view.  The obvious solution is to make one of those ends invisible ensuring a comparison cannot be made.
Given the scale of this obviousness, I can only assume that you're a sock puppet for an intelligence agency who has started to panic about the network going truly dark.
Deal with it.

I see that you were quite quiet whilst ad hominem attacks were being made against me.  But I will put that to one side for the moment.
As you mentioned, there are legitimate worries, mainly that Tor and people like yourself have a conflict of interest.  The main funding appears to come from the US military.  It appears to many of us, that the software has been deliberately kept weak to traffic analysis to support US intelligence operations.  In fact, it seems to 'fit like a glove'.  Further, that the issue of traffic analysis has been discussed in convoluted terms as a means of keeping that way.  Hiding from traffic analysis is not rocket science, nor does it require endless reams of papers and speeches on packet obfuscation.
Given that you are the head guy, I want to know what is going on?  If your reply consists of the stock answer, "well this is complex", keep in mind that I am a security specialist too and know that to be untrue.
I don't mean to be confrontational in any way, but the credibility of this project is on the line here.

Congratulations, so you found someone with a similar name what are the odds of that.  When you are reduced to digging up dirt, it stems from the fact that you are trying to change the nature of the discussion.
FYI, I am a security specialist.  I've previously worked with the Australian Federal Government designing software and infrastructure security for multi-million dollar projects to support National Security.  In fact, I do most of my consultancy work for government.
I see Roger has remained quiet, so I am assuming he either does not want to address the issue or is subject to a National Security letter.
These questions remain:
1.  Why does Tor appear to fit so well with a large scale espionage program that was implemented around the same time (namely PRISM)?
2.  Why, given the publication of details about PRISM, were moves not made to secure the Tor network?
3.  Why is there so much hostility to these questions, including character attacks and ad hominems?
4.  Is Tor an elaborate scam by the US military? (perhaps along with Bitcoin???)
5.  Why, given the simplicity of the solution, was hosting not an internal service in Tor right from the start?
As I have eluded to before, it does seem to me that Tor was designed to integrate into the US espionage apparatus and present itself as solution to anonymity, when in fact, it was ensuring complete traceability to the US government and selected partners.  Let me be clear on this, I do not think this was an unfortunate accident.

Fair enough.  I skipped through that talk and wow, you do look like you work at MIT.  It still seems to me that the marketing focus is given to a myriad of exposure techniques, but this global view is buried as a footnote.  Even though, it is the most important element.
I also noticed at the end of the talk, you began promoting Bitcoin, but failed to mention that the exchanges are monitored and the entire transaction history can be data mined.  Bitcoin is not anonymous, its about building intelligence on the financial links between people.  Financial metadata and statistical analysis that reveals the strengths of connections between people.  Its a bit like Facebook...or FinancialBook.
A serious blind spot exists when it comes to the real threats against users, large industry-scale espionage with international reach.  So, again, I reiterate my point.  From a completely objective viewpoint, it does appear that Tor was designed to fit into a niche role in the US security apparatus and that Bitcoin was just a logical extension of that program.
I don't know what role you played in this, perhaps you are naive, perhaps not.  I suppose we will get our answer to that in the future versions of Tor.

Thanks for the input, but this end-to-end traffic analysis is a well documented problem by the Tor devs themselves.  Although, what is missing from the devs statements is more revealing, namely that it can be fixed by removing visibility of one of the ends.  One must ask why that statement is missing and why it was never implemented.
Just by asking those questions, we can better observe the intentions, or at least make people squirm a little. :)

Well, let's see this:
We already know from the Snowden releases that the physical infrastructure for this is in place.  That it spans at least 33 nations covering all major fiber links.  Within the US, all traffic is copied verbatim at major exchanges.  In other nations, metadata can be shared to complete the picture.
We know that the physical infrastructure and regulatory frameworks are there, thus that must be going somewhere and as its metadata, that implies traffic analysis.
So, its a patchwork model and the costs are spread across many nations and information sharing to isolate sites is policy driven.

Well, let's put this another way.  On a planet, approaching almost 7 billion people, a network exists (Tor) that once had a substantial illegal content available (i.e. child porn, rape and snuff videos, etc.).  Then governments, such as the UK government, announce GCHQ was to assist in cleaning up the dark web.
Within a matter of months, not a single site can be found anywhere on the planet on the Tor network.
Then we also have Snowden, who informs of us PRISM.  An espionage program designed to provide a global view that was developed in parallel to Tor and it just so happens that this is Tor's Achilles heel.
Whether or not you accept the first part of the analysis is irrelevant, what really matters is the latter part and that Tor appears to be designed to integrate into the US espionage apparatus, rather than protect people from it.  Even when this is pointed out, no one makes any moves to correct the situation.
That pretty much tells everyone what they needed to know about Tor and its developers.

No doubt Snowden's documents are a mixture of real and fake material.  It would be standard practice to leave fud on the network to flush out leakers and those involved in espionage.  What Snowden knows of this is questionable.
The bottom line is that a solution must be implemented for end-to-end traffic analysis to protect hidden services.  Certainly there are questions about Tor and its devs, but the final implementation can be reviewed independently.

Interesting point. In many, if not most, countries the very act of
accessing such material is illegal. Yet, McCarron, in his post of 25
June, admitted on this public email list that he now had difficulty
accessing "the more serious categories, such as child porn and
violent sexual material".
That strikes me as stupid. Certainly it is not "low key" as you say.
