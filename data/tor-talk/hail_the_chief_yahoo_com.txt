@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and Hotmail. 
I know I am not the only person who is having problems using Hotmail and Tor.? I can login with no problems as per usual but when I try to open a message or change from the inbox to another folder then either I get sent back to the page that appears before the inbox or the inbox just stays the same.? I cannot open any messages.? This always happens and I have tried multiple exit nodes.
This has been occurring for some weeks now. I am wondering if anyone knows why this is happening.? It did not used to occur.? What has changed?
And is there a way to deal with this?? If Tor has stopped working with Hotmail then surely it could stop working with any site?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Selecting exit node by state - possible? 
Is there a way of easily finding an exit node by US state.? For example how would I find an exit node in Washington DC?
I can go to  and manually check all US exit nodes but this is time consuming.? Is their an easier way?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Questions about Tor changes after upgrading to Ubuntu 
I have just upgraded to Ubuntu 11.04 from 10.04.? 11.04 uses Firefox 6.02.
I followed these instructions ( and so added the Tor repository to my /etc/apt/sources.list then apt-get'd tor and I have three questions about the changes I have noticed from 10.04.
a) It appears that Polipo is no longer required.? My Firefox proxy settings show SOCKS 5 at 127.0.0.1 but the HTTP and SSL boxes are empty.? Presumably this is correct as Tor is a SOCKS proxy so all HTTP goes via it.? Can I confirm that all DNS now can go directly to Tor rather than requiring Polipo as the HTTP intermediary as was previously the case.
I appreciate that when you turn Torbutton "on" then network.proxy.socks_remote_dns becomes "true" which I assume means that DNS indeed does go through Tor (rather than to my ISP).
I see that network.dns.disablePrefetch;true also becomes "true" and presumably this also assists in maintaining the remote DNS.
b) I also assume that Vidalia is now an "optional extra" rather than required.? It seems as if Torbutton has replaced it.? Is this correct?
c) I note that the torrc file has moved from /home/myname/.vidalia/torrc to /etc/tor/torrc.? Why?
When downloading Torbutton from ( the Mozilla screen said "author not verified".? Why is this?
Thanks!? Much appreciated!
