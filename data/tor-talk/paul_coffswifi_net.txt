Some of the legal has broken links. ie  has been taken down by Google (self censorship?).
I got a cold caller email for the TOR mirror I have... I don't know who they are or what they are trying to achieve by trying to get me to update a link... Don't they know who to talk to???

  After updating the Tor browser to version 8, the ability to see the Tor
network chain has disappeared, through which repeaters it is currently
running. Is it so conceived? It is unreasonable, in my opinion. Or is it a
bug? In the previous version, after clicking on the onion, the chain was
immediately displayed ...
