@_subject: [tor-talk] Controller password - ARM 
Greetings all,
Since I've upgraded Tor from 0.2.2.35 to 0.2.3.13-alpha using the tor-devel
port on my FreeBSD server I've not been able to use the Anonymous Relay
Monitor (ARM) anymore because of this 'Controller password' issue..
On my server (terminal only) I was running Tor with ARM as a front-end to
keep check on things.. Since the upgrade from Tor there was an added
authentication method that required an upgrade for ARM as well which I did
thanx to Damian.. However ARM now asks for this 'Controller password' on
startup with the following two responses; Password found in
'/var/db/tor/.arm/armrc' was incorrect.. or Unable to authenticate: no
passphrase provided..
I'm not running Vidalia which I believe sets random passwords to
communicate with Tor..
My question is how do I get around this running just Tor with ARM on a
terminal only server..
Many thanx in advance for any input..

@_subject: [tor-talk] Python upgrade breaks 'random' in ARM.. 
Hi Damian et al.
I'm running Tor-0.2.3.15.alpha on FreeBSD 9.0, all fine..
However, I upgraded Python26 to version 2.6.8 (= up-to-date with port) & it
breaks ARM..
=> File "/usr/share/arm/starter.py" line 18 in import cli.controller
=> File "/usr/share/arm/cli/controller.py" line 11 in import cli.menu.menu
=> File "/usr/share/arm/cli/menu/menu.py" line 10 in import cli.menu.actions
=> File "/usr/share/arm/cli/menu/actions.py" line 8 in import cli.wizzard
=> File "/usr/share/arm/cli/wizzard.py" line 9 in import random
=> File "/usr/local/lib/python2.6/random.py" line 47 in from os import urandom as _urandom
=> ImportError: cannot import name urandom
Would you know a way around this because I'm not familiar with Python at
Any suggestions would be much appreciated..
PS. Running ARM from the executable comes down to the same problem..
