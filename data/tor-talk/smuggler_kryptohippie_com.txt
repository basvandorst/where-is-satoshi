Draft and comments sent via private email.
Private individuals: It seems to me that private individuals fall under
the same rule when providing services to the public.
In the sense of the law both middlemen and exit nodes provide
"telecommunication services". The concept of relaying communication is
enough already. Though for middlemen nodes one could take your argument
and say that it is an internal service (that means not affected by the
law) if it doesnt accept connections by any senders accept other Tor
nodes. I am pretty sure that if middlemen dont relay any traffic to/from
non-Tor IPs then they should be pretty safe. Unless however the Tor
network is seen as being ONE service (not many, i.e. per node).
I have made some daunting experiences with German law enforcement
(anonymizing only servers being stolen, home and office searched in very
early morning, direct charges against me as operator) even today. I do
NOT think that this is going to become better. So far non of their
assaults was successful because we had still some law to protect us. But
with data retention in the books we will loose that protection. I
imagine several LKA and BKA people already waiting for the day to f***
I hereby distance myself without being a core Tor developer or otherwise
affiliated with them.
Seems to be the most effective way for me. But it would leave the Tor
node ops with the problem of having to store the connection data. Which
can be some substantial cost to bear.
I meant that they might qualify streams as connections as well which
means that not only TCP/IP connection parameters are to be stored but
also connection data that is created by the protocol (e.g. being in the
stream). They already claim that for VoIP.
The problem with all that is that the exact technicalities are not part
of the law but are decided on level of bureaucracy and can be changed
every so often. The politicians have no clue about the Internet at all
and they don't have to because they leave the details to non-elected
"consultants" and other .
I think the best organisation to call for that would be the CCC.

Exactly, it is no law yet.
Well, the term "public comment" does not really apply to Germany. Most
of the talks and discussions that mattered were held without the general
public taking part (or being invited and/or allowed). The biggest issue
in the hearings was that some very large telcos are actually in favour
of the law (esp. DT). Many smaller telco companies wont survive the law
being passed.
The majority of the parliament and the "Bundesrat" (Senate kinda) are in
favour of the law. Only discussion today is how bad it will become and
when it comes into effect.
Thank you for wanting to fight for the liberty of Germans.
There is a project that is very active in that area and needs support:

Yes. More or less.
Contacting  and offering them your
support will do a lot.
Another thing is that there are data retention plans in the USS as well
so you should probably also team up with the EFF.

Wrong. I read the law. My lawyers read the law. It doesnt say: Store the
data you have. It says: Store these specific datasets, no matter if you
have them or not. The comments in the "Regierungsentwurf" are very telling.
So, I am sorry. Tor nodes will have to log. ISPs will have to log.
Everyone doing public telco services will have to log.
Actually, some companies do care for free speech and human rights. Mine
does. Which is why it leaves Germany now for more free ground.

No, upstreams/backbones etc dont have to log.
Only parties generating traffic data in the first place (dialup) and
parties changing traffic data (Tor) have to store.

I wonder if it would be a good thing to define "Middleman-Only" nodes.
Those nodes would ONLY talk to other Tor-Nodes. They will not accept
connections from non-Tor-nodes and not relay to non-Tor-nodes.
While the latter is currently configurable via the exit-policy the
former is not directly supported and thus quick hacks (like firewalling)
reduce the speed and reliability of the network.
The reason why to do this is that those nodes would not provide relaying
to the "public" and thus imho not fall under the various EU Data
retention rules.
Comments welcome.

Well, simple:
Backbones etc. are excluded from the data retention laws. As well as any
networks that are not available to the general public (like university
networks as well company networks).
By having middleman-only nodes (or better, second hop only nodes) those
would not be part of the "public" network but only infrastructure.
That means that those nodes would not have to log at all. AND they wont
be target to raids because those nodes would not be part of any records
at all if all other nodes in the chain are also non-logging.
It would allow German operators to continue running Tor nodes (second
hop only nodes) and other non-logging jurisdictions can provide entry
and exit nodes. However some german node operators might choose to do
entry/exit at their own risk.

Hi Ricky,
I know from personal experience that this is not necessarily true.
We had an IP under investigation. The RIPE entry showed it to be
operated by a corporation. All contracts (uplink, cage, etc.) were made
by the corporation.
That didnt stop the police to search my personal apartment (not the
corporate offices).

@_subject: UDP and data retention 
Hash: SHA1
I think it is missleading to talk about "connectionless" here, it is
"stateless". There is a relationship between sender and recipient as is
for TCP, however the state and handshake are missing.
UDP can be observed just as well as TCP unless you go for an extra mile
by using random source/destination ports which however still leaves the
sender/recipient relationship. Which however you could break by
falsifying the sender address...... getting some bad thoughts here.
