I'm seeing the same thing using "torsocks youtube-dl". It sounds like
they may be starting to block traffic from known exit nodes.

Hi Roger,
Is there a standardized way to evaluate a piece of software for privacy
flaws or does this require an actual audit of the source code?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser without Tor 
Hi all,
This is a question that we get from time to time in the Stack Exchange group. Can I use Tor Browser without without actually using the  Tor network? For example, I want to use the browser for checking my back account but I can't because my bank doesn't allow traffic from exit nodes.
A similar question that was asked recently is, "how can I connect to local IPs with the Tor Browser?". For example, my home SAN is on 192.168.1.X and it's not reachable with the Tor Browser.

Thanks for the reply!
Any idea about the second question? Firefox still has an "No proxy for" section on its proxy page. However Tor Browser no longer has that section. Do you know of any way to use that functionality or is that just gone now?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Use Tor in a right track. 
First of all, make sure it is Socks 5 + DNS because you want your DNS requests to be anonymous also.
Also, Tor is primarily an anonymity tool. If you have to log into Telegram with a private phone number, then you're not going to be anonymous and so Tor isn't going to be a big help to you. That is, unless you're using a burner phone/sim that doesn't have your real name associated with it.
Secondly, will the Telegram servers accept messages from Tor exit nodes? You might want to find out from others first before your spend money on it or get into trouble with their service.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Idea for a stand-alone browser based on Tor browser 
First of all, why not use Brave or Firefox for your non-Tor required needs?
Secondly, you can turn off Tor in Tor Browser. See here:

@_subject: [tor-talk] Private Exits 
The purpose of this email is to describe a solution that doesn't exist
but could. The technology is available, it just hasn't been created yet.
The current Tor network:
Alice uses Tor Browser to connect to mywebsite.com.
Tor Browser connects to a guard note, then a middle node, then an exit
node. mywebsite.com only sees the IP from the exist node and Alice
remains anonymous.
However mywebsite.com knows that the IP is from an exit node and at
first, it just annoys her with puzzles, then eventually it blocks her
altogether. She tries exit node after exit node and sometimes it works,
sometimes it doesn't.
Alice uses Tor Browser to connection to mywebsite.onion
Tor Browser connects to a guard note, then a middle node, then to
mywebsite.onion. mywebsite.onion only sees the previous hop but nothing
else and Alice remains anonymous.
The Tor network with Private Exits:
Alice uses Tor Browser to connect to myexit.onion.
Tor Browser connects to a guard note, then a middle node, then to
myexit.onion. myexit.onion provides a portal to the internet via a web
interface similar to a VNC session. myexit.onion is not recognized as a
Tor exit node and Alice can then go to mywebsite.com without any extra
Private Exits would exist primarily as a stand alone software
application. They would provide the user with a web interface that would
require uploading a public key to authenticate (similar to SSH). Each
Private Exit would normally have a 1:1 User/Owner relationship but it
wouldn't always need to be like that.
More Examples:
Pedro is a journalist inside of a country with stringent internet laws.
He connects to pedrowork.onion. This Private Exit is located at his
office in New York. He has complete access to the full Internet.
VPN Provider Iheartanonymity.com creates a shared Private Exit for their
paid subscribers. mywebsite.com sees users coming from a VPN provider
but they don't hold them in the same regard as Tor users.
Iheartanonymity.com only sees a small portion of the traffic that they
would see from hosting a traditional Exit Node and without the worries
about treated like one.
Suggestions appreciated. I am not a developer and even the simple bash
scripts that I write are so bad that they are a crime against humanity.
I'm just hoping to maybe throw out some ideas for someone else to implement.
Best Regards,
Jason Evans

Hi Grizzly,
What errors? How are you running it?
Tor Browser Launcher has had a lot of problems in Ubuntu in the past. What happens when you download and run it directly from the Tor website?
