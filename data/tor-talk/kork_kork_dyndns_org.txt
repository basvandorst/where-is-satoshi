Hi Oliver,
I suspect you might be missing /dev/random and/or /dev/urandom. You can
create those by running
mknod /home/chrooted/tor/dev/random c 1 8
mknod /home/chrooted/tor/dev/urandom c 1 9

Hi Oliver,
I just looked in the source, the crypto_seed_rng() function tries to
open /dev/srandom, /dev/urandom, and /dev/random, in that order.
Try making sure anybody can read from them by chmod-ing them to 644...
Which OS are you running?

My best guess would be that your proxy doesn't allow the CONNECT method
which I assume (not know :P) tor uses to tunnel through http proxies.

Hi Ben,
This header is from an internal "transaction" at Hotmail (65.54.229.28

Are you sure your MAC address is actually embedded in the TCP
My guess is that what you're seeing are the ethernet frames
that carry the ip packets used by tor's TCP connection.
If that's the case, we're talking about different OSI layers
(ethernet is layer 2, ip is layer 3), and only the ip payload
of the frames will reach the tor server.

@_subject: Sending mail through TOR/Socks 
I think this is the main reason why mailing fails so often: Most exit
nodes simply don't allow connecting to port 25. Every time you try
sending a mail and your exit node at that time doesn't allow it, you'll
get the described timeout.

@_date: 2006-03-03 21:17:29
@_author: Marco Gruss 
@_subject: insert mail 
You'd have to socksify postfix with something like tsocks.
Running an exit node allowing access to port 25 would pretty
much be suicidal (spammers would LOVE this!) though, so there's
a pretty high probability that you won't get a connection.

Whoops, I didn't get that, looks like I didn't read the original

Another possibility would be using a tool like rinetd or redir
to redirect $LAN:8118 to $LOCALHOST:8118 on the host. Not sure
if there's a Mac OS build of either of those tools though...

Hi Pascal,
The or port can be freely configured... 80, 443 et al. are just
the most used ones.
See 9876 is that server's port.
9031 is the port on which the tor directory is being served.
If you don't allow those destination ports, connections to those
servers won't be established. Other than that, it should have
no negative impact (somebody correct me if I'm wrong).

@_subject: exit node back to user 
Are you talking about the connection between the exit node and the
destination host, or about the connection between you as a user of
tor and the first tor node in the chain (i.e. your own)?
Both connections are unencrypted. Since your entry node is usually
running on the same host you're using it from and your connection
thus is through the local loopback interface, this isn't a very
big problem. Unless...
...your local connection is compromised; then the only difference
from the attacker's viewpoint will be a much lower speed (scnr).

Err... just create your own secret key and a certificate request
(for example using OpenSSL's CA.sh -newreq), choose "SSL Server
Certificate (Without CSR generation)" on StartCom's web site,
copy/paste your CSR, whee, you get a signed cert without ever
revealing your secret key to StartCom.
Am I missing something?

That's _exactly_ what's happening there when selecting the option
I mentioned.
You generate your key and request locally, send the request to
StartCom, you get back a signed cert.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor security on EC2 
Hello there,
with  actively promoting it,
I have been thinking about Tor vs. EC2 for a while.
Since at least Amazon's US datacenters are most certainly
under US jurisdiction, it might be possible for LEA to
obtain the private keys of EC2 tor nodes. Snapshotting
the corresponding EBS volume is trivial (in fact, you
can do it yourself from the EC2 console), so unencrypted
key files can be easily extracted.
You could use some kind of encryption (ecryptfs for your
tor home, or even cryptsetup on a second EBS volume) to
store your keys, but even then they could possibly be
extracted from a dump of the VM's memory (obtained by
running xen xm dump-core on the host).
Tor people, is there some kind of "automagic family"
for EC2 nodes? There's a (current, it seems) list of
IP networks available here:

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor security on EC2 
Ah, good point.
There are quite a few active non-bridge nodes though.
I seem to recall that Tor automagically "families" nodes from the
same /16; maybe that code could be expanded to family EC2 nodes
from the same availability zone. That might be a moving target

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor security on EC2 
That's true. It wasn't my intention to zero in on EC2 (which I think is
an awesome service) specifically, it's just that I have spent quite time tinkering with it, so I was kind of focused on it ;-)
