I have some questions regarding your numbers.
What exactly did you save? (2x4byte ip + timestamp?)
How detailed was your timestamp? (minute?second?milli?micro-second?)
Did you log every circuit build with start+end -time or every packet?
Is the patch avaliable to create a kind of european tor-script-set to
make it easier for tor-operators to stay legal instead of close their
(Maybe we can get the logs smaller and make a web-ui or script to
search for given
ip-list+time-ranges and also set up the
real-time-log-grep+signing+uploading with
minimal manual work of the operator.)

On Dec 17, 2007 5:51 PM, TOR-Admin (gpfTOR1) I reat a lot about this lately and as far as I can tell
instant-messaging is nothing short of electronic mail.
Thus it is far from data-retention-free.
The only loophole I could find was to not offer your service
publicly. Having a foundation that you can become a member of
(for free) and providing your own tor-network strictly for members,
that exits via the normal tor-network inbstead of directly to the
internet seems to be feasable.
Maybe this can be combined with the existing VPNs of free
wireless-comunities you have over there. I heard of one named
"freifunk" that seems to be pretty huge.

On Dec 2, 2007 10:47 PM, Alexander W. Janssen Probably but that's risky.
Just reminding:
Even as a non-exit-node you have to log if you provide your services as a
middleman publicly.
Logging is not only mandatory in germany but all of the EU to varying

I agree completely.
"DASI gegen Stasi" sound nice but not very credible.
What about "Anonymity e.V."?

Well, that's all good and valid.
But as an ISP controls all internet-access
of the client, it can with little effort fake
the tor-web+svn-server and some sites
where tor-packages for distributions are hosted.
(Unless they are signed like proper debian-packets
 but then again, users often have missing keys and
 thus ignore the warning. )
Thus he can change the initially distributed keys.
The ISP can also reroute the authorative directory
servers then and take over the client.
Well, where did you get the client from?
May that be "from the internet"?

If a middleman dies and the client gets to know this.
Can a running circuit be recovered by chosing a new middle-man and
informing the nodes down the chain about this?

@_subject: what about SMTPS over Tor? 
Hash: SHA1
One way to go would be to offer your SMTPS-server as a hidden service
and publish it's .onion-name to your users.
That works around any exit-policy-issues.
Yes, there is a dns-service that you can use to query if
a given ip is an exit-node and allowes connection to a given port(+ip).
(Not perfect yet.)
Your smtp-server can send mails through scripts and thus remove/rewrite
these lines. This can also be done on a local sendmail that the client uses
(thus no need to trust the server) instead.
Rewriting all the ".onion" in the headers also helps with servers that
check these
to be valid dns-names.

"Will be"?
There is a whole network of yacy-servers and at least 2 non-yacy
search-engines already. There are wikis, blogs, file-upload-sites,
hosting, irc-servers, ... today.
