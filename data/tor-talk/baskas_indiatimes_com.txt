I noticed TBB-2.3.25-1 is using 'cached-microdescs' which removes the
end-user's ability to choose exitnodes based on each server's exit
example of informations in obsolete 'cached-descriptors':
router name and IP address
reject *:25
reject *:119
reject *:135-139
reject *:445
reject *:563
reject *:1214
reject *:4661-4666
reject *:6346-6429
reject *:6699
reject *:6881-6999
accept *:*
Is this informations still available somewhere else? Maybe a torproject.org URL?

@_subject: [tor-talk] 'cached-descriptors' replaced with 
'atlas.torproject.org' appears to contain very, very little useful
informations and no informations on specific exit port availability
per router.
Would it be so difficult to make available on torproject.org like was
on serifos 6 yrs ago?
Thank you.
