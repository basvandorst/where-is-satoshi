@_subject: How to ban bad tor node which would redirect http request to a certain ip tracker? 
I recently found some "bad" tor node would redirect http request to a
pre-configured address such as
   where xxx is a 18 digit number contain a Unix time stamp and url is
the original url requested.
then  the host 218.86.119.72 will send back a cookie which named
'UniProclove' whose content is also a 18 digit number.
Is it possible to configure tor to isolate such a "bad" tor node?
or is it possible to configure tor to refuse to connect/relay to
certain ip addresses?

I dont know how to find which node did the redirect.
Seems that it is difficult to track this node, it only occurs from time to time
Now what i can do is to block browser cookies and/or configure Privoxy
to block this kind of urls.
