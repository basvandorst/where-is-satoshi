@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor2web 2.0 is live! 
Hi all,
We are glad to announce the release of the new tor2web software.
For those of you who are not aware of what tor2web is let us give you a
brief description. The goal of tor2web is that of promoting the use of
Tor Hidden Services
( Hidden
Services allow people to run TCP based services without disclosing the
identity/location of their server. In the specific they allow people to
anonymously publish content to the web. Also, since you are being
reached trough the Tor network, you are not required to have a static ip
address or purchase a domain. This lowers the entry barrier to content
publishing and protect the content publisher from retaliation and Denial
of Service attacks.
The problem though is that Hidden Services are usually only accessible
by installing a Tor client
( Tor2web
creates a transport, by acting as a web proxy, between the internet and
the Tor network. This means that anonymous publishers are able to reach
a much wider audience. The user visiting a website though tor2web is
always advised to install a Tor client as by doing so he will protect
his identity and leverage Hidden Services end-to-end encryption.
This version of tor2web (called tor2web 2.0) is based on glype PHP web
proxy ( and it is by no means the definitive
solution. We are currently working on a new design that will be able to
withstand other "attacks" that are currently possible.
What we have implemented is:
* A clear disclaimer warning the user that the content is not being
served directly from the server, but it comes from the Tor network
* Contact forms for abuse complaints and to report broken websites
* Transparent rewriting of URLs into the tor2web form (i.e.
so4rmjdiwmqjosxz.onion become so4rmjdiwmqjosxz.tor2web.org)
* Blocklists to allow a tor2web node maintainer to block particular
websites, the blocklists are stored in md5 format so the node maintainer
does not need to store potentially illegal site lists.
At this current stage we would like the community to stand-up and help
us by:
* Finding security and functional bugs in the existing implementation
* Volounteering to run new tor2web servers:
   In this first stage we are looking for reliable systems, run or
endorsed by trustworthy organizations involved in anonymity and privacy
research and development.
For the new release the goals that we wish to further pursue are:
* Distribute responsibility across multiple actors
* Minimize the probability of takedown of a tor2web node

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Bundle: PGP encryption built-in? 
I actually think it would be a great idea to include PGP encryption
support into the browser.
I remember discussing this with Jake some time ago of maybe in the
future having a bundle for Thunderbird and enigmail. I don't see why it
it a bad idea to move one step closer into that direction by including
PGP in the TBB.
Well that attack proposed there is pretty basic, I really think this is
a useful idea and it should not be discarded with no thought.
I must also here disagree, but I think I am a bit biased .
Anyways as I said, it would be of great use for people to be able to
user PGP built into the browser, at least for sending encrypted email.
It should not be implemented in a rush, but the gain that can be drawn
from such a feature is not slim.
Instead of having people download and install complicated software to
send me and an encrypted message I can point them to the TBB and they
are all set. Not at all a badi dea.
Robert, why do you have to be so negative?

@_subject: [tor-talk] massive automated bridge requests: why? 
Hopefully this will not be a double. I seem to forget easily what email
is subscribed to what lists :(.
True. I have also some rudimentary statistics built from bridges.csv,
that highlighted this issue some time ago, but from what I understand
this is starting to become a serious problem.
Yup, the package in question that apparently is shipped mainly for a
Chinese audience is a bundle that contains also Tor. The problem is that
the torrc contains statically hardcoded bridge IP address.
Here is a link to the commit in question:
When I first saw this the dates did match up with the traffic spikes to
Tor bridges, though it did seem strange that these requests where linked
to non Chinese speaking countries (Italy, Brazil, Spain).
This highlights that the issue is probably much more complex. Somebody
has developed a custom crawler to scrape for fresh and new Tor bridges.
I can imagine that the person who developed this though it was the
smartest idea in the world and I don't believe he meant no harm. Yet the
responsible application/tool/bundle must be identified and the developer
instructed to stop doing so.
Since the requests are coming in from every client every 30 seconds,
this must be seen as an attacks. What they are doing, in effect, is
conducting a DDoS on bridges.tp.org.
For this reason I think it would be appropriate to manage the issue as
if we where up against an adversary and start by trying to fingerprint
the application making the requests.
This would require probably to patch BridgeDB
( to log anonymized request
of the attacker.
Once the application responsible is spotted we should get in contact
with them and have them fix the bundle to stop doing these requests. If
this is not possible we could maybe write a snort rule or something
inside of BridgeDB directly to filter out and stop responding to illicit
malicious requests.
The CAPTCHA solution would work, however if the issue can be solved
easily by just detecting the UserAgent of the client making the request
(in case this is not being spoofed by the application, see above point).
Maybe implementing something slightly more complex, but that leaves the
user experience unaltered such as matching for request header order.
On the second solution I remember reading a couple of papers on it and I
believe there was also a presentation at CCC 2010 on it. I can't seem to
find them at the moment but I will update as soon as I find out.
I will try to do so and update you on the status of the inquiries.
That seem highly unlikely to me too.
Maybe some OSINT tool? Somebody who wishes to have highly levels of
anonymity by not disclosing that he is about to connect to Tor, but is
too lazy to setup a custom Tor bridge?

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor-blocking sites 
I think another thing that has not been properly dealt with proof of work
systems is that they they are generally not "ecological". By this I mean
that by doing a proof-of-work you are wasting resources by consuming
This phenomenon is especially evident in systems such as bitcoin, where
the hardcore miners will do precise estimates as to how many power they
will use up (therefore money spent) in relationship to how much they are
able to get back (bit coins generated).
A direction that I see extremely interesting is integrating distributed calculation
projects a-la SETI at home, The Lattice Project etc. into proof of work systems.
This way you would not only be wasting your resources but would actually be
doing something useful.
If we fail to make proof-of-work systems systems, I think we are making the
spammers win. If proof-of-work starts to become widely adopted and widespread
we should have though of this today, rather then tomorrow when people
will be wasting Peta-Watts of power over useless CPU cycles.
This is a very good question especially since we are seeing more and more
devices mobile devices and systems that don't have access to the same
computation power.
You just can't pick a size that fits all because the most advanced mobile phone
will never have 1/100 of the CPU power of a recent desktop computer.
