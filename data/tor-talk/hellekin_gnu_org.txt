into unknown criminals using the Tor network, or did I misread the blog?
When such things happen in the Uneven States of Appearances, the
authorities are used to suspend people's constitutional right to free
speech for Some Good Reason?. After the recent gag order revealed on
Mayfirst where the FBI wanted to exert political pressure on Greek
activists, I read this as a canary's egg, and related to the Sony Hack.
Pure speculation of course, but much more probable than any Russian
conspiracy, even if we're talking about investigating a foreign
corporation (indeed, what would the U.S. FBI do anything there? Chill,
it's just the Foreign Bureau of Investment litigation).

*** That is wikileaks for psychopaths, as presented:
"Its estimated that 5% of the general population are psychopaths.
Introducing financial incentive in an anonymous framework will produce a
greater yield of leaked information than from say the ideology that
drove patriots like Edward Snowden. For every idealist willing to
selflessly sacrifice their freedom, assets and even risk their lives for
a greater good, there are 1000 psychopaths willing to anonymously sell
out their peers for material gain."
Let's see:
"Exclusive bidders attempt to purchase the data for their own use and /
or prevent other parties from acquiring a copy. Should an exclusive
bidder win the auction they alone will receive the decryption keys. The
same data cannot be auctioned a second time on the Slur marketplace."
Those are the psychopaths and sociopaths with infinite funds as they
steal them from the public, like good organized criminals they are, in
the form of taxes, property, and exploitation.
"Crowd bidders pool their funds into a single bid. Should they win the
auction the network will release the decryption keys to all users on the
Slur marketplace and the information will therefore become public."
That's us, the public in need of the leaks.
At the risk of being publicly slurred, I don't think openness is good.
I think opacity is better than transparency in general.  I like secrets.
 What I don't like is psychopathy, corruption, sociopathy, power and the
abuse of it.  Opening an information market will certainly keep the bad
guys going, not stop them.  The bad guys will buy the secrets, sell
lesser secrets on their enemies, and slur will become a second-hand
pre-emptive declassification market to keep people away from the real
stuff.  Lost in translation.
But yeah, why not?  Turning anything into a market seems to be the way
to go--not.  So, libertarians, prove me wrong.  The only way I see this
becoming useful is if it forces the value of XBT up against the USD.

People can now vet the released chunks, pass their own judgement and
decide whether to start bidding on the remaining chunks to unlock them."
This is actually far from stupid, but I still disagree on the
commoditization of the leaks, the blackmailing (either way), and the
opportunity for the leaked party to buy silence--which is, it must be
noted, exactly what is actually going on in the current system, where
(self-)authorized parties decide what the public can read or not, and
especially when it can read it, making the leaks a flare in the dark sky

and participates of a sociopathic approach to society that is at the

addressed all criticisms we had received so far, but didn't bring much

that this issue is not a priority.
It makes use of the RFC6761 to claim special top domain names but my
feeling is that the DNS people would like to see most of "our" issues
addressed through DNS itself, and would likely prefer to divide the
contents of the RFC into special cases. There's also discussion to
rewrite, or amend history and restrict how RFC6761 can be used to not
follow the main IETF process.
As we didn't receive any more feedback and still have some time to
think, and not much novelty to add to the draft besides removing some
repetitions, it's been standing there. So I'd be more than happy if
other people would like to review it and pinch the ball.
The issue Anders is concerned about, namely that some entity could
reserve .onion and use it against Tor users, is mentioned in the
Security Considerations section, as well as 5.3.7 that references SAC45,
a previous document that already mentions possibilities of conflicts
between DNS, and P2P or private names from a study of DNS root invalid hits.

*** That is a common technologist / U.S. liberal / libertarian issue to
give responsibility to "the user" for "their" "failures" to do anything.
The poor-is-lazy argument.
But for non-hackers, the reality is that apart from booting Tails and
enjoying a proper Tor setup, installing the Tor package on most distros
does not come with pre-installed DNS and *will* leak queries by default.
So technically, you may argue that it's not Tor's responsibility, and
leave it there. But if you're honest you must consider the objectives of
the software, and distros, and end-users as being part of the "Tor system".
*** And irresponsible as well.
*** That effectively suppresses the anonymization of Tor in that case,
against a global adversary that is Not So American and have capacity for
eyes around the globe to pin your digital footprint to your ICBM
location in real time.
*** One complexity factor here is that not all systems resolve names the
same way, so you need to figure out from Tor whether the name was
resolved securely or not, which is not necessarily doable.
*** If useful websites can pop up under .onion, fake copycats can also
pop up that will mimick the original target without the user being able
to notice due to the natural latency of the Tor network. Then you can't
trust Tor anymore to do its job: for an end-user .onion means the site
was obtained via the Tor network. If it was not, because a DNS leak
brought you to the site via the clear Web, you're done.
The only meaningful failure for the leak of .onion to the DNS is loud
failure, aka NXDOMAIN, which is why it's technically important that IANA
forbids registration of .onion in the first place. As far as the DNS
supporters at IETF are concerned, it should be Tor's responsibility to
"use DNS properly" and avoid "integrating top-level domains into the
browser's location bar for convenience" (both quotes condensed paraphrases).
I guess one of the tasks for the next P2P-Names draft is to properly
decouple the DNS issue from the browser-location issue so that .onion is
not anymore a DNS-abuse issue, nor a convenience issue, but a strong
usability issue.
Aside, a second task is to maintain the cohesion of Tor and non-Tor
systems as a single technical non-DNS-based Peer-to-Peer name resolution
issue to avoid "special treatment" of minority networks, and ensure a
future for a techno-diversity of name resolution systems. Societies of
control like to think their (human) identity systems as definitive, and
history tend to consistently prove them wrong. The last thing we want is
to force all name resolution into a top-down, non-autonomous technique,
administratively-controlled centralized system that prevents better
techniques from evolving.

This attitude of disdain of yours is prejudicial to the countless people
who need some privacy and cannot have it because they have no clue how
to do it themselves, and they were thrown into a technological world
where engineers didn't bother building privacy-friendly technology.
If you are among the people who can trust their networking equipment
because you built it, configured it, tested it, and eventually can
change it whenever you feel like you should, then obviously, the Cloak,

So yes, you're part of the technical elite, and then what?  Does that
mean other people can't enjoy the benefit of their Constitutional Rights
at all, because engineers failed to encode them in the technology that's
sold all over the world?
If a router can provide a minimum of privacy, why wouldn't people go for
it?  Obviously, the Anonabox demonstrated that there's a lot of demand
for online privacy, and no matching skills from the buying side.
Going from zero protection to something is better than nothing at all.
As far as anonymity is concerned, there's no technical solution to it.
One has to work hard and tight to preserve their anonymity.  So probably
the Cloak shouldn't claim anonymity, but keep their claims in check with
reality, and be happy with privacy.  Or rather, provide a more explicit
threat model, where the term "anonymity" is contextualized and the model
is understandable by non-technicians.
I see no reason to spit on initiatives that try to bring solutions, even
if the solutions are not to your taste.  When there are false claims and
an obvious will to deceit, be my guest and kick ass.  But not everyone
has your skills nor your understanding of limitations, and civil
conversation can help a lot more people to learn from your wisdom than
any argument of authority.
And if you cannot trust your FREE HARDWARE network equipment, you have

for people to have two Ethernet ports, one to plug to the ISP modem, and

When I witnessed the success of the Anonabox campaign, I attributed it
partly to the fact it has 2 Ethernet ports: it's conceptually
straightforward for people to "see" a bridge with two "entries".
But now I think it would be better to explain why it's not necessary,
and how the physical world and the digital world work on two different
levels of reality.  The mindshift required to conceptualize a network
bridge with a single network interface card is about the same as to
understand that the aggregate of rational micro-decisions can generate

for murder because of a credit card transaction demonstrating he was

Black and white are a weak approximation.  A weak approximation doesn't
survive a reality check.  There are indeed two aspects to consider: one
is that using Tor for non-anonymity-critical aspects provides both more
stress on the infrastructure, and more cover traffic for people who
actually need the anonymity; two, more Tor users mean more Tor
infrastructure cost.  Those are two correlated issues, but need to be
considered separately, otherwise you fall into the trap of using Tor
selectively, where the goal would rather be to use Tor in every occasion
so that global surveillance is much harder.  If that goal seems too
extreme, it doesn't matter: the natural growth of Tor usage makes the
argument stand for itself.  You cannot prevent users from using Tor for
any purpose (freedom 0), not only because the license says so, but also
because it's a fact: are you going to spy on Tor users to determine what
is legitimate or not?
More usage will bring more infrastructure cost: that has to be
addressed, because the Tor network is relatively dependent on U.S.
military budget.  Not that I appreciate those bucks go into Tor rather
than in Gaza or Ferguson.  But you get the picture: don't put all your
eggs in the same basket.
*** Indeed, more exit relays would be great.  And router projects that
incorporate Tor can be a great way to add a plethora of them.  Except
maybe having a plethora of low-bandwidth exit nodes is not so
