I understand that it is not necessary, but I believe that making your
own ad blocking software would bring more people to tor. It does not
even have to come with the bundle. It could just be an optional add on
called, Tor Ad blocker.
Inappropriate ads are the main reason why I would just shift back to a
browser in which I can maneuver easier.

I did not think that Adblock was trustable considering how an
extension can bypass Tor.

I agree with Mirmir, but I would still be more comfortable if it was
made by Tor.
