An extremely interesting post.  I'm new to tor and am considering
setting up either a relay or a hidden service on an Ubuntu machine
running behind a single router on my home net but have hesitated to set
it up because of concerns about leakage.  I'll follow this thread with
great interest though I'm too much of a newbie here to contribute
anything substantive.

I would hope such a list does not exist.  The prospect of a home visit
by the federal LEOs would give those who maintain an exit (or any other)
relay second thoughts -- to say nothing of inviting ISPs to do some
blocking.

how is polipo installed?
I've tried to delete apt-get with    sudo apt-get purge tor polipo with
no success ... how can I completely remove tor and polipo so I can start
reinstall of both over again?

Same questions here. To answer your question,dear leader, it's because I
screwed up the first attempt to install.
