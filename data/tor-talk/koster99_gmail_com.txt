After updating the Tor browser to version 8, the ability to see the Tor
network chain has disappeared, through which repeaters it is currently
running. Is it so conceived? It is unreasonable, in my opinion. Or is it a
bug? In the previous version, after clicking on the onion, the chain was
immediately displayed ...
  Regards, Oleg!
