A CA will not validate a '.onion' address since it's not an official TLD
approved by ICANN. The numbers aren't random. From Wikipedia:
"16-character alpha-semi-numeric hashes which are automatically generated
based on a public key  when a hidden
 is
configured. These 16-character hashes can be made up of any letter of the
alphabet, and decimal digits from 2 to 7, thus representing an 80-bit
number in base32 . It is possible to
set up a human-readable .onion URL (e.g. starting with an organization
name) by generating massive numbers of key pairs
 (a computational
process that can be parallelized
) until a sufficiently
desirable URL is found."[2]
