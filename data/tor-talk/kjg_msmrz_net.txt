Is the tor-announce address[1] not being used anymore? I have not
received announcements there for ages.
It would make sense to me to have both new source code and new
binaries/packages announced on that list (or on another list which sole
function is announcements), as they become available.
Whoever uploads the new source or binary, sends an e-mail to that list
the moment they do that.
Each user can keep an eye on that list and decide for themselves: Do I
grab the new source and compile, wait for the binary announcement and do
nothing for now, wait for the binary announcement and shut down the node
in the mean time etc.

Thank you. That makes sense then. I did receive that announcement.
Ok, I understand. No betas or individual binaries on that list then. But
how about he idea of announcing all sources, including beta, ?nd all
individual binaries on this list as they become available? The
announcemtns could have a fixed subject line format so people can just
filter them to a folder, or even throw out any announcements that they
do not care for because they use a different operating system or don't
care for betas etc.
something like this maybe?
