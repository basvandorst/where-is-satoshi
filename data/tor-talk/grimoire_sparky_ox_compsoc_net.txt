Trademarks are only valid within a particular field of endeavour. Since
tor.com is a book publisher, not a provider of anonymity software, there
should be no problem.
This is why Apple Record and Apple Computers both traded happily until
Apple Computers started providing music...

@_subject: Some legal trouble with TOR in France 
Under the British "Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act", they would
simply confiscate the entire machine, demand any authentication tokens
required to access it, and lock you up if you refused to surrender them.
I believe similar laws exist in most EU jurisdictions now.
You're assuming that the police are not colluding with the DRM
manufacturers. If they have access to a signing key which the TPM
module will trust, they can put any trojan or rootkit they want on your
machine, assuming that Microsoft haven't done so already ;)
Remember, the point of restrictions management systems like TPM is that
Intel, Microsoft and other members of the TPM Alliance get to control
who has access to your computer, not you.

Which in the UK at least could land you in prison for up to 10 years.
Virtually nil? Let's face it, anybody who really understands TPM won't
be using Vista anyway, and those who don't will just fall for marketing:
"Microsoft are commited to helping the Government fight the War on
Terror and to this end have installed TPM software to protect our users
against terrorists and e-hackers"
I wouldn't be surprised if the US Government at least *mandated*
TPM-level access.
You can, can you?

@_subject: Tor bandwidth requirements (was: Some legal trouble with TOR in France) 
The Tor documentation states that 20k/sec each way is the minimum
requirement for a Tor server. If that documentation is wrong, and lower
bandwidth would still be useful, I'd be happy to run a server.
I could definitely offer 10k, perhaps 15k. I think it'd be useful if Tor
would be happy with 5k, since that will make running Tor servers on the
increasingly popular (in the UK) 128kbit upstreams feasible.

Out of interest, do we have any statistics on the ratio (in terms of

@_subject: Connecting to special ports through Tor/Privoxy 
This is because your Privoxy is configured by default to only allow
HTTPS connections to port 443, as the original response to your question
stated. You need to configure Privoxy to enable HTTPS connections to
other ports.
This is a Frequently Asked Question - see
for the solution.

@_subject: Tor and NNTP 
Yes, it is (and incidentally, thank you for supporting Tor). There is a
script which allows you to parse the "Tor directory", and see which Tor
servers will act as an "exit node" to your NNTP server. These servers
are the ones from which you will see connections.
The script is linked to from (among other places) the Abuse FAQ on
 - I cannot look up a direct link myself currently.
This looks like a sensible way to configure things. Your news server
will see connections to the "hidden service" as coming from localhost.
Yes, this should be possible.

When using Tor, there will be an encrypted connection from your computer
to a Tor entry node. Then the connection will bounce (still encrypted)
to a Tor middle node, and then (still encrypted) to a Tor exit node.
Only between the Tor exit node and blogger.com will the connection be
Anyone watching your internet connection will not be able to see which
websites you are accessing (or even whether you are accessing a
website), nor what you are communicating over your Tor-encrypted link.

This is why you should always establish the SSH key fingerprint through
some other mechanism before you try to connect. I've got the
fingerprints for servers I often connect to written down in my wallet.

Newer WRT54GS and similar models have less RAM because they run a
proprietery embedded OS rather than Linux. However, Linksys are aware
that many people bought their models for homebrew hacking, so they
released the WRT54GL which has more RAM for Linux hacking.

@_subject: GPG Preferences 
If GPGPreference only accesses keyservers over HTTP (some keyservers can
be accessed over other protocols), and it's honouring your request to
use Privoxy as an HTTP proxy, then it's configured correctly. It might
be worth configuring firewall software not to allow GPGPreference to
acccess external network connections, and see whether it still works.
The point of Tor is that you can use programs that aren't "meant" to be
used with Tor, to access networks that aren't "meant" to be used with
Tor. If it's important to you that your ISP (for example) can't see that
you're accessing a GPG keyserver over HTTP, or that the keyserver can't
see who's accessing them, then that's great. Or if you want to generate
"innocent" Tor traffic so it reduces the value of any particular Tor
connection for a hypothetical adversary, of course.
