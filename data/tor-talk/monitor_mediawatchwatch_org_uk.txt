Tor newbie here.
I set my relay (running on an Ubuntu VPS) to hibernate after 2GB and  everything seemed to be working fine until the time came for it to  wake up for the first time. My log showed this repeated error:
Jul 14 14:11:56.045 [notice] Opening OR listener on 0.0.0.0:443
Jul 14 14:11:56.045 [warn] Could not bind to 0.0.0.0:443: Permission  A tor restart seemed to fix the problem, with logs showing
ORPort [my-IP]:443
as being reachable from the outside.
Don't want to have to manually restart every day. Any idea what the  problem might be and how to fix it?
Thanks in advance,

Thank you, Roger. Should I edit the TorFAQ, so that others don't make the same mistake as me?
I need to hibernate as my bandwidth has a monthly cap. Any port recommendations, or should I just go with the default 9001?
Thanks again,

@_subject: what is best - speed or stability? 
I run my relay on a VPS with limited bandwidth, so have set it to hibernate every day after 1Gb usage.
When I set my RelayBandwithRate to 50kb, this means my relay is running for 12-16 hours per day.
If I set it to 25kb, it runs all day - and switching off hibernation becomes possible.
Which is the most useful option? Longer availability at a slower rate, or limited availability at a higher rate?
Thanks in advance,
