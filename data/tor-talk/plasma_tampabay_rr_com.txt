Did such "bad guys" not find ways to cover their tracks before the Tor concept existed?
Becasue a thing can be abused, does not make the thing a bad idea, or make it at fault for the abuse.  It facilitates nothing; as this same behavior would still continue without Tor, and has existed long before there was Tor.
Much like Firearms, a good analogy made by another or-talk subscriber.  I don't honestly feel we have any obligation to curb our function or behavior simply becasue there is a dirty mind out there capable of misusing it. Government Issued Tor Licenses a la FCC?  The more Government control there is over a given freedom/right, the more conflict of interest there is.  Serving up that Conflict of Interest on a silver platter, by insisting that abusers should be a concern of ours, is not responsible.
All tyrants rise from false "need."  What we "need" is for companys to have tighter security.  Failure to do so implies that Tor created the exploit, when in reality, it was just a conduit to a pre-existing deficit.
If you leave your garage dor open, and go on vacation, you might just get some of your stuf stolen...  Wether the theif drove up in a car with a tracable license plate, or did it with an Invisibility Cloak; doesn't Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.

Unless the Address variable in your torrc is changed to you new IP address; the tor network is going to keep trying to use the old IP as stated there.
I wish it would read from a seperate file so that I could run a script that just grep/awk-ed the IP from whatismyip.com (wget whatismyip.com | grep foo | awk -F bar '{print $x}' > /etc/?torip?), checked for changes, and would automaticaly "/etc/init.d/tor restart" if the IP was ever different, and also change the IP in such scenario...  I could write it to rewrite the whole torrc file each time, but that's anoying and dirty...

Bah, I see no problem with using it to evade the RIAA.  sure, it sucks for us Tor people who use it for what is was intended for.  It just means we need more nodes, and we need to grow more to support this demand.  I'm all for giving the finger to "the man."
It's time for Tor to expand, not regulate.  And if expansions isn't possible, just let it suck!  I can't imagine many fileshare people will cleave unto dial-up speeds with their broadband...  Once they learn that it sucks to use Tor, they'll stop.  We need knee-jerk decisions in this project like we need knee-jerk political actions...
But, that's just my $0.02

I see your point, but you miss something important.  Most file-share people don't leave their computers on 24x7.  When it takes this long to Download stuff, they usually NEVER get it.  Most are also windows users.  Their systems are flooded with spyware and general bad design; they just don't have that kind of uptime.
Even bandwidth regulation is a research concept that can have effects on other aspects of Tor.  I'm not agaisnt the matter.  The greatest scientific discoveries are followed by "Hey, that's weird, whoda thunk it?"  They aren't planned.
Trying to gestapo Tor into submission is kinda defeating the concept, I think...  But giving it some thought could possibly teach us all how our hidden services could be attacked.  Which begs the question, obviously a hidden service pulls more pipe than a client; if there were no fileshare people.  Couldn't you just put 10 computers on a linksys and al keep repeatedly going to that hidden service, and make exposure by traffic analization pretty easy?  How would bandwidth limits affect hidden services?
I talk too much....

I think this idea is the most suitable route to follow on the matter.

@_subject: Hello directly from Jimbo at Wikipedia 
I've avoided this conversation, until now.
Frankly, I like Tor just the way it is.  It's NOT suitable for high-volume use OR misuse.  It's slow, it's quirky.  Its easy to block.  This should make it clear to us who is our friend and who is not.  Granted, there are some real reasons why exit nodes might get blocked.  But compare it to the much larger volume of other methods used by the unscrupulous...  It becomes as stupid as the gun-control debate.
Bad things are gonna happen.  If you want to get your word out badly enough, just set up a hidden service with thttpd and a PHP blog engine of some kind.
I think having a seperate co-habitating daemon to perform this pseudo anonymity, for those who might want it, would be great.  It's OPTIONAL.  Kinda like USE flags in Gentoo.  I don't have to build in X11 support for apps that I'm only going to run in a terminal window.  They still run, and they cut way back on dependencies...  but I digress...  It may be too much work for the site admins to impliment support tor pseudo...  We're a very small segment of the internet.  we don't pull a lot of clout, especially with the black sheep reputation.
I think Tor needs less problems to solve, as in, fewer people demanding it do things it was really never meant to do.  Just let the network grow, let some people hate it.  You can't please everyone.  I never asked the world to love me, why should Tor?
But that's just my $0.02...

Tor is a good cause, I'm glad you've decided to make this effort.  My box is up 24/7/365, no accounting.
I highly recommend you try Gentoo for this system, other distros are just too bloated and difficult to secure.  Gentoo gives you only what you need, unless you ask it for more.  See if there is someone local to you who is familiar with the Gentoo distro.  It's touted as a tough nut to crack, but it's what I learned on.  Their documentation is impeccable.  Even if you don't understand a word of it, just cut and paste the commands and it'll work; and you'll be learning what most distros don't teach.
I'm sure you can find someone familiar with Gentoo at a local Linux User Group.  I know they'd be more than happy to help you get a box going.  It's not even half as daunting as you may have heard.
There are many distros that are "easier" to install, but you'll be in the dark when bad things happen.  And they will.  With Gentoo, you'll know how to fix things before you even get it installed.
My $0.02 anyway.

I frequently get unbearably slow circuits with Tor.  With donated bandwidth, it's the nature of the beast.  With broadband, we get spoiled.  It's still faster than most dial-up.

I'm lazy, and have not read much documentation, but maybe there is a way to avoid internal nodes of a specific advertised bandwidth?  Why would a node be able to advertise its bandwidth, if one cannot use this information in a useful manner?  I know that it is used internally to pick circuits, maybe there is a way (or a way could be made in the next version) to allow a CLIENT to specify "DoNotUseNodesWithAdvertisedBandwidthOfLessThan N" in torrc?  Might help out people who are less concerned with volume of available circuits, and want a little more speed.  But, may be detrimental to the balance of the network in it's infant stage....  Maybe somebody smarter than me can fill in these blanks?
That has got to be the coolest variable name of all time....  ;-P
