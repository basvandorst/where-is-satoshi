I have been having an issue where my linux tor server is getting the hard
drive filled after less then a day of useage. I tried changing the logging
section of the torrc file to only debugging info, but it still seems to have
a problem. I have since set up a cron job to delete the debug.log file each
night, but I would rather find out what is causing this file to fill up my
hard drive.
Below is the logging section of the torrc file.
Log debug-debug file /var/log/tor/debug.log
 Logs go to stdout at level
"notice" unless redirected by something
 else, like one of the below lines. You can have as many log lines as
 you want.
 Send all messages of level 'notice' or higher to
 notice file var/log/tor/notices.log
 Send only debug and info messages to /usr/local/var/log/tor/debug.log
 debug-info file /var/log/tor/debug.log
 Send ONLY debug messages to /usr/local/var/log/tor/debug.log
Log debug-debug file /var/log/tor/debug.log
 To use the system log instead of Tor's logfiles, uncomment these lines:
 notice syslog
 To send all messages to stderr:
 debug stderr

@_subject: DNS leak check 
I was wondering how you check that your DNS requests are not being leaked. I
have setup tor as a server on my Linux box at home and have just now got
privoxy running on the same server. I ssh into that server from my computer
at work and tunnel the connection into privoxy then into tor. Where would I
look to find the dns request and where it is being routed? How can I make
sure that privoxy is doing it's job in hiding the dns request. The
connection I have not looks exactly the same as before I had privoxy
installed and was just using tor.

Thanks, I thought that the debug level was only for errors. Would commenting
out all the logging levels then cause no logging to occur at all? Is that
probably the best way to run the tor server, or should I have some sort of
error logging in place?

Ok, so the problem hasn't gone away. I have commented out all of the lines
in the torrc file for the logging thinking that would cause no logs to be
created. But it seems that the logs are being created someplace else. Where
would these logs be, as they have again filled up my hard drive to 100% and
I need to purge them to get my system working again.
Thanks for the assistance. The section in the torrc file relating the log
files is below, and as I said I have commented out each line. Would the logs
be going to the stderr or syslog as a default location. I probably should
just send the logs to /dev/null just to make sure that they stop filling my
hard drive.
 debug-info file /var/log/tor/debug.log
 Send ONLY debug messages to /usr/local/var/log/tor/debug.log
 debug-debug file /var/log/tor/debug.log
 Send ONLY warn messages to /usr/local/var/log/tor/debug.log
 debug-warn file /var/log/tor/debug.log
 To use the system log instead of Tor's logfiles, uncomment these lines:
 notice syslog
 To send all messages to stderr:
 debug stderr

Sorry, I am running on Fedora Core 3, so I compiled the sorce as I didn't
see a binary for that one.
I may have found the files. I have deleted the /var/log/message and
normally is. I have also changed the torrc file to send logs to /dev/null to
stop this from happening again.
