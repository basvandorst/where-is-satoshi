I've put up some graphical world maps of the tor user to internet
population per country ratio. Tor user statistics are from
 and the internet pop. per
country data from the world factbook site (latest data set is from 2009).
To cut a long story short, here's the url: Disclaimer: no guarantee that these maps are correct! ;-)

Hi, once I cleaned up my scripts and rewrite some parts for easier use
it could be very well automated. So in general the answer would be: it
can be done ;-)
Here's a very quick (simplistic) summary:
1. I've downloaded free availably so called "shapefiles" which contain
country-shapes (multiple polygons) composed of coordinates (lat,lon). [1]
2. wrote some perl scripts to read these files out with the help of some
already available modules [2] and generated and generated some out of it
for easier use.
3. with the help of the GD module [3] I plotted these coordinates and
voila, here is the world map.
4. now I only need some input data, like tor average user data and some
other stuff like internet population per country data (from the world
fact book..the cia one). [4]
5. done
[1] -  (world countries shapes files)
      (This dataset is freely available for academic and other
non-commercial use.)
[2] - [3] - [4] -  &
Another question was:
Yes, right now it just shows color data without the scale data/numbers.
I will think of a better way to display this.
Anyway, these graphs were more like a side effect of my map plotting
experiments and i found them interesting. If time allows I will try to
enhance and automated them.
..till then, happy tor surfing/networking/relaying/developing..

some updates:
I generated some maps with
a) raw tor user data per country
b) tor users per country in % compared to their internet population
for each day in 2011 and created 2 small .avi's out of it.
You can find them here:
cxe7alag5fac2bln.onion (.onion url for use with tor)
 ("normal" access)
Both .avi's are around 1.5MB.

final update for the time being:
Video of Tor Usage over the period
october 26th 2009 - december 31st 2011
[ tor usage per country in % compared to their internet population]
same url as before:

avi is 9.6mb
