Our Response
    In Solidarity with Jacob Appelbaum and on the Side of Justice for All
We, the undersigned, are a group of women who have been friends,
colleagues, co-workers or partners of Jacob "Jake" Appelbaum over many
We have decided that we must speak out due to the nature of this
coordinated and one-sided attack on his character and work. It has
become clear the mainstream media are unwilling to fact-check, and only
too willing to persist in spreading uncorroborated and unfalsifiable
rumor. This statement is to give our positive experiences with Jake from
our first-hand, long-term perspectives, over many public and private
We do not claim to know what happened in precise situations that we were
not present for, and we do not want to trivialise and minimise any pain
that may have been caused. But we are observing  beyond the
allegations, that are not for us to comment on specifically  an
egregious character assassination is being played out with numerous
defamations online and offline. This is not how the truth can be
determined, or justice for anyone done, whether law enforcement is to be
trusted or not.
We would like to state that our experiences with Jake are different than
what is often being portrayed. We know Jake to be a kind, loyal and
dedicated person. We do understand Jake can be outspoken and provocative
regarding a number of issues  which can come across as offensive 
however, we have never found Jake to be as is being alleged.
We are not apologists for any genuine wrongdoing, and as women working
in this community we know that there are struggles around sexism.
However, simple punitivism is not how the human rights that we all
defend should be enforced or framed.
We believe that an open and evidence-based discussion in this situation
is necessary to allow our community to develop better processes to
handle any allegations. Furiously targeting one person without allowing
for proper fact analysis will never solve the bigger structural problem
that has been highlighted. We should use this moment to grow and make
things better, not destroy the movement and create divisions. We need to
create a channel for discussions on how to make things better.
We stand in solidarity with Jake against the way this is being handled
and on the side of justice for all, in hope the truth on all sides will
be able to come to light in a rational and constructive manner.

all women who have known Jake for many years. We know that there are
