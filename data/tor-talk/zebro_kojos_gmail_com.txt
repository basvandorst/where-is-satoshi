@_subject: [tor-talk] 'Iran plans to unplug the Internet, 
Perhaps there are more sources with more detailed/sourced info.
Thought this was relevant.
I wonder whether they plan / the idea would be to completely detach from
any foreign communications, save for some 'approved' nodes for banks and
I suppose if the Dark net plan were more mature at this point, it would be
possible to theorize the creation of a mediating cluster of nodes connected
to the internet via wifi-darknet / whatnot, that would rebroadcast to the
local darknet via wifi etc.
But holy damn. (I suppose the Iranian plan is premature etc., but still.)

If Tor is installed system-wide and the download site actually supports
resumes (if it's http, it may not; if it's ftp, it's bound to work afaik),
you can just do
torify wget -c If it breaks (or you need to stop - ctrl+c), you can resume later on by
executing that same command.
That should be safe, right? wget does not store cookies if it's not told to
do so explicitly, I think.

That's why 'torify' / torsocks can be useful, I suppose :) it forces all
traffic through Tor, afaik.

I hope wget does not fill in http-proxy headers in its requests, i.e. no
info is leaking that way? I suppose not.

Good idea. Since I'd be using wget in a virtual machine that does not know
the external IP anyway (host-only adapter) - that's what I'd suggest simply
to be sure (tor could be running on a separate VM that has access to
external internet - bound to that same host-only adapter), I wasn't
interested in really finding out, just suggested caution. But yeah, either
wireshark or some sniffer, or just wget a file on a server with access to
webserver logs ;)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Restarting Firefox 
I'm sorry because I haven't read the entire conversation up until now, but
if people are using Ubuntu, what is stopping them from doing
  sudo apt-get install tor    ;
configuring relaying in torrc and using the Firefox/Aurora/whichever
browser from TBB (would need to change the listen port, etc.)?
tor can run as a daemon; furthermore, you'd have such tools as *torify *so
you could just do
  torify wget or whatever. I think it's more versatile/flexible this way, no?
if I'm 'out of my element', sorry :)

Ok, understandable.
then again, SocksPort is just one line.. I mean one could write a simple
script and publish it for such users (which I might do in order to stop
this drooling of mine);
one finds the line, and changes the port number. Problem  solved?
For relaying, it is a matter of uncommenting, i.e. removing two hashes from
the beginning - two to ~five lines, depending on preference.
Any interest for a program that reads config from torrc, displays in a
simplistic GUI, and lets the user change options?

So from what it seems, the malware included a bitcoin miner that perhaps is
to report found blocks / sub-hashes (? is that a term; i.e. if it works in
a mining pool) to a server, perhaps this site in question.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Mail service requires "java script enabled" 
Java + Tor = bad
Javascript in Tor browser bundle + Tor = probably OK.
Ideally, you won't be using javascript, but as others have said, many mail
services require javascript for more interactive and fancy UIs, and that's
What you *don't* want running with Tor is Java. Java is a virtual machine /
large framework which works in browsers via a plugin. Stay away from
plugins (save for those recommended for / included by Tor Browser bundle /
Tor Browser developers). But as long as you're running TBB, you should be
ok. Javascript = an interpreted language / engine entirely *inside* the
browser infrastructure (whereas Java is not).

@_subject: [tor-talk] ssh over tor 
I'd also be interested to hear from anyone who took the time to research
this further. I for one arrived at the same conclusion as Lars at least in
regards to DNS leaking, and saw no way for anything to be leaked, really.
(Also, if netcat fails at some point during the ssh session, the pipe
breaks, and that's that, no leak problem.)
I've had a very similar line [1] in my shell's rc for a long time now. :)
but would be interesting to hear others' opinions, as I think quite a lot
of people may be using this way to do anon ssh.
[1] ssh -o "ProxyCommand nc -x 192.168.64.1:19234%h %p" -D 20234
(Tor binds to 192.168.64.1:19324; also dynamic-forward via port 20234 - a
kind of a chained socks proxy.)

@_subject: [tor-talk] [OT] rewriting a text 
I have indeed heard of folks using e.g. google translate to let it do a
translation from [original lang] -> [some other lang] and back to ->
[original lang]. No sources though - would be interesting to try and let
the Anonymouth or any other tools identify authorship of such pieces of
text (input excerpts of original texts authored by multiple people ->
double-google-translate one of them -> see if it is identifiable still by
any of those tools.)
I've also heard of it being possible to deduce the relative amount of
entropy in text compared to some counterpart (another, corresponding text)
- the idea being, a translation of an original piece will have >= entropy,
which is deducible by summing up the general usage frequencies of each of
the words in a given piece of text (have to have word frequency
dictionary/data of course). This sounds a bit flimsy and in any case naive,
but if one were to implement such a measurement tool, two pieces of text
could then be compared by the amount of information (well, 1/entropy) they
It might make sense to write a simple tool which, given an original input
text, substitutes some general-but-replaceable words with more unique /
less unique counterparts from a thesaurus. However, syntax (and style,
still) would remain an issue. I've seen forum posts on some boards where
deliberate simple / pseudo-creole English is used, supposedly (such being
the speculation there) with the help of google/whatever translate - several
passes of. Would be interesting to hear of any (more) actual
studies/research about this, though.

You are quite right, the absolute majority of syntactic structure prevailed
in this case. I did some experimentation now, it generally seems that
either significant portions of the same phrases are preserved (it attests
to the relative quality of the translation engine I suppose - doing proper
longer-phrase<->phrase translations), or it comes out as something too
unreadable. Had an interesting result after trying a larger portion of text
(from Alice in Wonderland - always good to have it on hand - [1]) on
english -> german -> arab -> latin -> english - a change of third->first
person in a part of the text, etc. But overall rather disappointing indeed.
