@_subject: [tor-talk] tor mention in newle released snowden documents 
if someone want to pick up on this thread, the nsa notes from that
meeting with dutch intel can now be found here:
 [3 pages, short
discussion of TOR starts at the bottom of p.2].
7 lines are censored by the newspaper, reportedly upon the request of
the dutch intelligence agency. after that, it reads 'they [dutch intel]
are looking at marrying up the forum data with other social network
info, and trying to figure out good ways to mine the data that they have'.
there's a number of theories circulating about what has been censored,
and why. any thoughts?
