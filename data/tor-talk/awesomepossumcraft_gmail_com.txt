Is anything else know about the attack using Javascript? How does that
even work? Speculations, wild guess, reports, and rants are all

As long as the current guard model is in place then the relay could
probably tell if its a client vs bridge by the frequency of visit. I'm
assuming that a client visits one of its guard more often on average
then a random bridge would connect to that guard. There is probably
something in the code that tells the node which spot they are in.
The network would be slightly less secure because the chances of
having the first and last node would be improved, making correlation
attacks easier. It would how ever not be a third easier though,
because of Guards and exits wouldn't be used (much) as a middle node.

I just found this from the EFF, which may be helpful.       Will EFF represent me if I get in trouble for running a Tor relay?
*Maybe.* While EFF cannot promise legal representation for all Tor relay operators, it will assist relay operators in assessing the situation and will try to locate qualified legal counsel when necessary. Inquiries to EFF for the purpose of securing legal representation or referrals should be directed to our intake coordinator by sending an email to info at eff.org  . Such inquiries will be kept confidential subject to the limits of the attorney/client privilege. Note that although EFF cannot practice law outside of the United States, it will still try to assist non-U.S. relay operators in finding local

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Bundle Unity Integration 
I was wondering if it would be possible to integrate TBB into Unity, as in the toolbar would be on the top and a user could search them through pressing ALT. Firefox has multiple extension that come with Ubuntu which makes me believe it may be as simple as installing them in TBB.
Is it possible to integrate Tor Browser Bundle into Unity/Ubuntu and would it cause any sort of ability to profile or leak sensitive information?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Unimportant Error in FAQ 
Hello everyone!
I'm not sure where to submit unimportant errors in the docs.
Anyways, I noticed that there is an error in the FAQ. It says "Most people who ask us this question don't want to distribute just the Tor software, though. They want to distribute the Tor Browser . This includes Mozilla Aurora  and Vidalia ." Since version 3.x of TBB Vidalia has not been included.
Thats my unimportant error in the docs.
Keep up the hard work on the important errors!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Onion Pi and Tor Talk Meta 
Adafruit has a tutorial  on how to make a Onion Pi, that was featured in Make Magazine. (It was actually my first exposure to Tor.) It works by having a Raspberry Pi run Tor and broadcast a WiFi signal that uses the Tor connection. Then, laptops can connect to the Wifi and use their computer as usual, but using Tor. I was wondering with all of the DNS leak issues and such, am I correct in thinking that this simulates running Tails? (i.e. does it effectively remove DNS leaks and prevent programs such as Skype from using non-Tor pathways?)
Also, how do I only respond to part of peoples emails in the list? (i.e. have a some of their text with a blue bar next to it, then some of mine, etc) I'm using Thunderbird.

I thought Tails worked by routing everything through Tor, as does the Onion Pi setup. Isn't Tails using transparent proxying, as everything is routed through

For me, running the most recent version of TBB on Ubuntu 14.04, I can stream videos from Youtube fine. I just have to temporarily allow all the page then refresh, then repeat again. It streams, slowly, but it does stream.
