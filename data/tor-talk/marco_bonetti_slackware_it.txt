try removing or commenting out the DirServer entry from your torrc file (

it's the second time this problem appears, maybe a default
misconfiguration slip in the unstable packages? (I mean: DirServer looks
really useful if you want to test out an unreleased version in a private
tor network, but it's less useful when the program is released ;-) )

tor is basically a socks proxy. by default it listen only on localhost,
rejecting incoming requests from other interfaces, you only need to set it
up on your server to also listen on other interfaces and use it once
you're in the vpn. so, for example, if now you're using 127.0.0.1:9050
once you set it up you can shutdown your local copy and use
10.66.66.1:9050 instead.
please refer to official man pages: and Also take a look at the wiki, it's full of interesting stuff:

You've to adapt the script limits to your own setup:
+ RATE_UP is maximum overall upload bandwidth, mine is 480kb out of 512kb
+ RATE_UP_TOR is minimum bw assigned to tor, I choose 160kb which should
be the minimum bw to mark your node "fast", IIRC
+ RATE_UP_TOR_CEIL, finally, is the maximum bw assigned to tor. As in
Perry's script I've assigned it the same value of RATE_UP
As I wrote before, my personal taste is not for traffic shapers but I
modify the script and tried it for a couple of days nevertheless. For what

@_subject: Confusion about TorButton, Noscript, etc. 
This is something I was thinking about for some times now, thanks someone
has bring it back up to my attention :)
I completely agree with anonym: it's a shame. However I prefer having both
of them installed as NoScript is wonderful for off-tor browsing and
TorButton is great for in-tor one.
But, as reported in the faq and in this thread, allowing a site via
NoScript can expose the user to javascript injection by rogue exit nodes.
So, a brainstorming of possible solutions:
1) use different profiles, one with NoScript for off-tor browsing and one
with TorButton for in-tor. probably the best one but, you know, it's
always nice to have an "all-in-one" solution
2) ask Maone to include a "Block Scripts Globally" option which will block
everything nevertheless, it should be fine to block everything on the
NoScript side and then fire up TorButton. This feature should work as a
dual of the already present "Allow Scripts Globally (dangerous)"
3) ask both Maone and Perry to work on a way to exchange information
between the two extensions. I don't even know if such a feature is
possible (I'm brainstorming afterall! :-P ) within the mozilla framework
but it would be nice if, once enabled, the TorButton extension will ask
NoScript to temporary block everything
What do you think? (maybe we should also invite Maone on this topic)

@_date: 2008-08-18 14:47:08
@_author: Marco Bonetti 
@_subject: Confusion about TorButton, Noscript, etc. 
I wrote to Maone about this issue, pointing him to the or-talk archives.
He replied with some interesting ideas, I'll report them here:
1) user actions
The user can enable/disable javascripts globally from the Tool (or Edit)
-> Options -> Content checkbox or toggling the state of QuickJava (
 ) button before
enabling Tor
2) TorButton action
The TorButton extension can switch to "false" the javascript.enabled
configuration option, NoScript will not be angry about it :)
3) NoScript action
NoScript can lookup if TorButton has been enabled, this way it will only
whitelists sites that are both under the user whitelist AND are providing
a valid SSL certificate
My ideas regarding points 1 and 2: I haven't read the torbutton source
code, does it toggle the state of javascript.enabled? I think so,
especially after reading this bug report
 however, with
javascripts disabled the NoScript extension should be all ok and not
causing problems.

define "protection that you need" :)
if you "just" want to browse the tor network leaving less traces behind
you, yes, TorButton is enough.
NoScript offer extra services, which are useful during *BOTH* in- and
off- tor browsing session like XSS and CSRF protection, chrome
information leakage and some DOS using external protocols.
Unfortunately, this protection comes at a price: the main NoScript
feature is the whitelisting of trusted sites and this can be exploited
by rogue exit nodes which will inject javascript into clear text page
they'll send you back.
Note that this behaviour is not tor dependant: an ISP can always inject
javascript in clear text pages it will route to you. It's just more
useful *WHEN* running a tor exit node as it could reveal the identity of
A good workaround is, for now, manually whitelisting only trusted ssl
pages (for which content injection is quite hard) or having this option
incorporated inside NoScript as mentioned in my previous mail regarding
this thread.

 > Ok, so as long as I don't whitelist anything, those attacks are pretty
not true: NoScript has a default whitelist with popular domains like
google.com or yahoo.com
nothing :)
let's try to clarify things a bit.
+ TorButton works on privacy: it enables the right proxy settings and
provides some extra protections to prevent identity leaking. One of this
feature is blocking of all javascript code to prevent injection by rogue
exit nodes.
+ NoScript works on security (which is not privacy) it enforce a set of
rules so that malicious sites or bad programmed one can't exploit some
common information stealing tactics like cross site scripting or cross
request forgery to gain illegal access to sites with your credentials.
The core of all NoScript defenses is blocking javascript too.
Those are the basic important concepts: the extensions works on two
different things and their core functionality is the same, block all
javascripts (then they do much more, but each of them in their context).
Now, the problem: one of the feature of NoScript is selectively
whitelisting sites so they can run javascripts or other possibly
dangerous content (like flash objects).
While this is a normal behaviour when browsing off-tor (as you usually
trust your ISP but it can be exploited nevertheless) it becomes
dangerous when browsing in-tor as TorButton will disable javascripts and
NoScript will enable them if the site you are tor-browsing is whitelisted.
I hope now it's a bit more clear :)
However, I've still a question regarding this problem: Maone wrote to me
saying that if someone or something globally disable javascripts,
NoScript will honor it and it will not try to revert the behaviour. To
me it looks like that if TorButton will switch the javascript.enabled
options, both of the extensions could work fine together. I'd like to
hear more from Perry about his work on this topic :-P
And, as a final consideration, whitelisting only ssl-ed sites is a
temporary workaround to be sure to have the functionality of both
extensions without the questioned problem.

that's the whole point of encrypting the communications and sharing the

a man in the middle can reroute traffic through his nodes but it will be
useless (except for sending your connections to /dev/null) as it can't
fake the private keys of each node.
In the italian wikipedia article, the author is wrongly assuming that
public keys for directory authorities will be exchanged through
Internet, so they can be easily spoofed, while they're already safe
inside your client.

The article talks about rerouting tor connections, not distributing a
trojaned tor package.
In the first case the (original) client is safe as keys are stored inside
it, in the latter where're not talking about tor. Once you trojaned a
program, any program, you haven't discovered any limits or
vulnerabilities: you've just INSERTED them.
It's funny, because this reminds me of some years ago: there was an
italian team which claims to have beaten any secure connections to home
banking sites and that https was dead. Guess how? with a trojan that
intercepts login/password. they surely got it right ;-)
It's stressed on the faq and every time you run your client: tor is not a

I can confirm the "HTTP jump" instead, on a customizegoogle-d profile and
on a vanilla one, both visiting  with every
"private data" cleared before each try.
I had monitored the connections with latest burp suite (it was handy, no
serious preference over web scarab), there're two http connections:
1) the first one during login (an id is sent out as a GET parameter)
2) the second one during logout, this one is really noticeable as firefox
itself will warn you about the https-to-http jump (you can turn off this
warning but it should be on by default)
I'm not a google expert and not too sure if the information sent in plain

No, preventing DNS leaking is up to the protocol used to talk with the proxy.
You can, however, use tor button with other proxies and get the extra

It all boils down to the point on how much you trust your users ;-)
You can even have some fun trying to set up a transparent proxy on your
gateway (be warned that's not too nice if your users will discover you'll
end up routing all their traffic via tor, without a warning)
Good point. If you need to run Tor on several of your machine, using a
central server would be the best option. Also, see
for a similar issue.
I bounce the question to a devel or an expert, IIRC Tor should build up
circuits as the load increase, but take the tip with care ;-)

It's not that simple.
I've just took a look at
 it's the first hit on
"bittorrent rfc", I hope it's ok :-P
As you can see at
 the "ip"
field is totally optional (many bt clients let you specify your real ip,
usually after you enable a proxy setting), the tracker will identify your
client with the "peer_id", the "port" values and what you need from / have
to offer to the swarm.
The tracker response
( will send
you a list of peer_id/ip/port and your own entry will be composed of your
peer_id and and (non torified) port with the exit node ip.
Data exchange is described at
 as you can
read the peers only check if the peer_id is a valid one (it is in the
tracker response), not if the ip address is a known one, in this way you
keep on reporting torified ips to the tracker and the real ip to the
clients you connect to.
Unless trackers will start accepting id/ip "corrections" from clients
(quite useless as it can lead to serious swarm damage as there's no strong
authentication mechanism) this method will grant you some anonymity.

@_date: 2009-02-20 16:35:42
@_author: Marco Bonetti 
@_subject: Bittorrent 
yes, the tracker will register the connecting torified ip if the "ip"
value is not explicitly sent in the connection request
others users will not be able to initiate an handshake with you because
they had the wrong ip, but your client is not idling in the meantime and
it will initiate himself handshakes with other ips received from the
not a total leech, you'll just be slower to join the swarm as it's all up
to the torified client to handshake with other peers.
once the handshake has been done, it doesn't care who starts what as long
both of the peers keep exchanging data.

this is true if you enable javascript on http sites while using tor, as a

I think that mozilla policies for accepting addons should not allow an

Generally speaking, if your javascript enabled profile is being
exploited by a malicious site, well, there's nothing which will prevent
the browser from reading any other files or directories on your disk.
yup, see above.
The only real threat scenario I could see is that a user donwloads a
compressed file with html and js via Tor, unpacks it and browses its
contents. Enabling file:// could allow any plugins/script/whatever to do
nasty things(tm) but, frankly, it's quite absurd.
In the past there were virus spreading via password protected zip
attachments with the password written down in the mail, so the victim
had to consciously open the file and run the executables, but I've still
some hope in the average Tor user ;-)
AFAIK, only the download of crafted addons. But I'm also interested in

Uzbl looks like a nice browser but I don't think it will be good for Tor
usage: anonymous surfing is not just a matter of enabling a proxy setting.
The user has to secure the code which arrives to his browser, either
turning javascript completely off or using TorButton "selective killing",
then he has to look for those html tags which could do nasty things like
opening side channels and when he thinks it's all over he should start
looking at which informations he send to the web server, in order to blend
in the crowd, either stripping them off or changing his settings
accordingly (like the user agent or the program's window size).
I admit, however, that perception of "good anonymity" is quite personal,
so I think it's ok if the user will surf with a new browser while being
conscious of the related problems, or, maybe, it will be cool if someone
will start developing TorButton features into other browsers as well ;-)

Hello list,
I was reading this Ars Technica post:
when I saw:
"The Personas project, which was launched by Mozilla Labs in 2007, is
now an official part of the Firefox browser. Personas are lightweight
themes that allow the user to trivially skin the browser's user
interface and apply custom (usually tacky) images and colors to the tabs
and main toolbars. Mozilla maintains a Personas gallery online where
users can go to get new visual styles."
When I tested (by chance, I admit) personas back in May, just before the
italian edition of e-privacy, I've had found that the extension will
send a cookie with your ip in plain sight back to the Mozilla network.
The problem is that this cookie is not updated that often so, for a
rogue exit node spoofing/reading getpersonas.com traffic, is really too
easy to grab your untorified IP. Not to mention that I throw the
extension to the not-so-friendly-to-tor bin and I forgot about it.
Now this announcement caught my attention, so the question is: is anyone
 doing any tor tests on firefox 3.6 and/or older firefox with newer
versions of personas? I'd like to know if this behaviour is still valid :)

@_subject: Bitorrent with Tor 
Hash: SHA1
This question has already been addressed with much flames on this very
own mailing list, take a deeper look at the archives ;-)
The answer is "yes and no": if you do a "full-Tor" bittorrent sharing
system, tracker and clients are hidden services inside Tor and noone
from outside can peek swarm.
If you use Tor to cover your torrent traffic, the only usable way to do
it is to torify only the communication from your client to the tracker
(which are like http requests), the swarm traffic is not easily
torifyable: you'll end up as a leech and not a sharer because the exit
node will just ignore the connections from the swarm (remember you're
contacting the tracker with the exit ip).
The problem is that client-tracker communication does not carry any
piece of copyrighted material, but this is the usual way to find a
sharer : just fake a torrent client and ask the tracker which ips are in
the swarm, then sue them all. :-)

Hash: SHA1
Hi all,
long time ago someone ported Tor and privoxy over to the iphone
platform, together with an iTor.app application:
Unfortunately looks like everything disappeared, does anyone still have
any pointers to that project?
In the meanwhile, I was able to build libevent, tor and polipo using the
 linux cross toolchain for iphone os 3.1.2 (that's all I got) against a
local cydia telesophoreo checkout. The result looks promising, I was
able to surf with safari proxied through local polipo:
I'm going to do some more tests before pubblishing anything, probably
I'll ask for inclusion in telesophoreo or I'll host them on
slackware.it, anyway I got a couple of marks:
1) strictly related to tor: I build the latest stable release *WITHOUT*
the --enable-iphone switch. As I can understand from the post linked
above, that option will jusr add some compiler flags needed only by
older version of the iphone toolchain/firmware and I think that probably
they could be removed as no longer necessary. Does anyone know something
more on that patch?
2) looks like that repositories for jailbroken phones build stuff with
iphone os 2.0 toolchains, I don't know if my debs will ever work with
older firmwares: they worked for me (so far), YMMV ;-)
3) I have a couple of ideas for a .app that will behave like a smaller
vidalia for the iphone, let's see what I can get out but do not hold
your breath: I have a toolchain but I still know too less on building
Obj-C UI with it so it may take a while :D
That's all for now, I'll hope to post something more interesting soon!

@_subject: why polipo? 
Hash: SHA1
cool, do you apply the patch to windows tor bundles? if not, it could be
worth to be applied :)
on the other side, I've mixed feelings regarding the possible switch
from firefox to chrome or any other browser but if this will help
spreading Tor, I'll more than gladly welcome it

@_subject: enabling bridges on NATed clients 
Hash: SHA1
It's cool to personally implement it if you want to made a NAT-ted node
visible: run pwnat on both servers and fire up tor on the internal one.
Here in Italy we've a big provider which heavily use NAT (Fastweb) if
you dig up the mailing list archive you can find a guy (Ian, maybe?
can't recall right now) who was able to publish a NAT-ted node using
iptables and an external host.
The only drawback of such solutions is the 1-to-n kill ratio: kill the
external node and you kill n clients behind it :(

Hash: SHA1
only peers of the swarm you connect to will have your real ip. the
tracker will probably just see your exit node one and announce it to
other peers as well.
there was a similar thread in this very mailing list last year, we also
end digging up a proposed BitTorrent RFC too :)

@_subject: Torbutton : please offer better user agent choices 
Hash: SHA1
could you dig a little more on the need of a choice of different user
agents? I'm not getting the point of why there should be choice: if the
users using this feature start changing they UA, the blending will be a
lot more weak.
If you really need it, just disable the feature in TorButton and install
the UA switcher extension: after all TorButton is the essential
extension for a complete firefox/tor setup but not the only one required
(although it does a great job all by itself).

@_subject: Bringing back Tor on the iPhone - take 2 
Hash: SHA1
I spent some time polishing the build scripts and creating a repository:
if you want to try it out, take a look at Right now it only hosts a copy of Tor, libevent and polipo.
You've to start the programs manually from the command line but they
work quite good: I did some tests and I was able to relay traffic and
host hidden services.
I hope you'll find them useful,

- From my tests, I can assure it is no longer needed on firmware 3.1.2, it
would be nice if someone else will be able to provide some more data.

@_subject: Quick question on Torbutton and NoScript 
IIRC when I was questioning about the torbutton/noscript compatibility I
received this answer: "if you turn on js, you break torbutton
functions". This was long time before the noscript restriction of active
content during https and many versions of torbutton ago, when noscript
was still an unfriendly tor extension, so take it with a pinch of salt ;-)
I'm assuming that, yes, enabling js via noscript will take over
torbutton block mechanism but the ability of noscript to restrict the
active contents from https only is a great aid in such situations.

Do you, or anyone else, have an English article on this topic? In Italy
we've something very similar since many years.

Hash: SHA1
another http proxy switch between polipo and privoxy! ;-)
I'd like to know if there are any specific reasons for this time choice,
like hardware support or ease of compilation or whatever. Maybe polipo
timeouts when chained to Tor which were mentioned some times ago?
Congratulations, again, for the release: Tor on mobile devices is great.

ok, thanks!
I like to eat my own dogfood :)
As I'm currently experimenting with Tor on the iPhone I'm trying to
tackle most of the problems mobile users will encounter, the polipo
timeouts are one of them.

Hash: SHA1
Looks like against hand devices has already been done  ;-)
I submitted your links to my friend Barenghi of Politecnico di Milano
who is researching in this field: last year they ran this kind of
attack against a SPEAr Head200 development board, equipped with an
ARM926EJ-S running on Linux 2.6.15. Results on RSA attacks are published
here: While he was at it, he also added that they'll publish soon newer
attacks against AES 128, 192 and 256, quite impressing stuff! Which has
just been pubblished as a technical report at:
