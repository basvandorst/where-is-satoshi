The bitcoin p2p protocol is a binary protocol with packets of fixed
size and structure, the packets that broadcast the addresses of other
known nodes to its connected peers can only contain numeric addresses:

The reason for such bundles is to be user friendly. To make an
application that will be accepted by ordinary end users it is
absolutely essential to make *one* installer that will set up
*everything* so that it can be used immediately after the installer is
finished. Even only two separate installers are already too much, it
needs to be exactly *one*.

I have seen it, I need more time to read about it and learn what APAF
actually is and how the final product that would come out of such an
effort would look like. It surely sounds interesting and maybe
something useful can result from it.
But unfortunately you should not expect much movement in Python
TorChat (from my side) for the next few months, at the moment I am
working 99% on rewriting TorChat from scratch in a compiled language
(the core of it and a libpurple plugin based on this code is already
finished), I'm planning to completely move away from Python as soon as
possible, the new TorChat will be one small static native binary with
no dependencies and also the build process and build dependencies for
it will be greatly simplified.
But I will still follow the APAF project with interest and try to
learn more about it, it sounds interesting.

It needs help from the Tor devs. For example Is there a fixed ftp or
http address where I can always get the latest stable tor.exe (only
the naked .exe file without installer)?
Please show us the code of *your* competent solution for a portable
Tor-using software on an USB key that can simply be plugged into any
Windows, Linux or Mac PC and then just works. We could all profit from
it. Static linking and/or bundling a needed runtime environment is
*not* a sign of incompetence, its a result of necessity. Even Tor.exe
itself contains some statically linked 3rd party stuff.

No. If this worked then there would be a serious flaw in his
configuration. It should not even try to resolve the hostname without
the help of tor.

What is bad about the torchat protocol? Is it its pragmatism and the
fact that it does not use xml and other bloat?

No, these few string replaces do not waste any time or resources, this
claim is totally ridiculous.
The protocol is self documenting, just print the messages to the
console as they are, the commands mean what their names suggest, it is
so simple you can even simulate a complete handshake and chat session
in telnet manually. Not every hype of the day (xml, protobuf,
binary-json, etc) must be used only because it exists and someone
thinks it has a cool sounding name, sometimes a simple line of text is
enough to transmit a simple foo=bar key-value pair without needing to
wrap it into kilobytes of obfuscating bloat.

2013/1/7 Outlaw :
Malicious code on the client machine could sniff the traffic on the
localhost interface or any network interfaces *beetween* your browser
and your own tor client). Also the browser (or a proxy located between
the browser and your tor client) could theoretically log the requests
in its history and someone could read it.

That would be the server hosting the hidden service. But the server of
some Website you visit and what it does with your requests is beyond
your control anyways (if it not your own server).
