@_subject: [tor-talk] How to know the running state of a Tor relay? 
For study purpose, I need to know whether a Tor relay is running or not at
a specific time in the past. Is it possible to get the information and how
can I do this?

Now I know I can use  to get
the running state of the relay if I have its IP address. But a relay may
change its IP address over time, which makes it difficult with this method.
So is there any way to get the running state of a relay if I have the
fingerprint or nickname which are more stable info of the relay?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Get relay information from the "Network Status 
The "Network Status Consensuses" file contains some relay information I
need. Now I have a relay's fingerprint, but I did't find a fingerprint
field in this file.
How can I get a relay's information from the file by the relay's

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why some optional weights of router bandwidths are set 
As we know, some weight params are applied to router bandwidths during path
selection. In the process of computing node weight, I find the the
consensus' "bwweightscale" param and the exit position related
params(eg.Weg,Wem,Wee,Wed) are all set to '10000', which results in every
node has the same weight value of 1. That means node's flag, such as
'Exit','Guard','V2dir', doesn't have effect on choosing the exit node.So I
want to ask what's the reason of the design like this?
