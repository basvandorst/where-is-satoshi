@_subject: Mixminion <-> TOR ?! 
Wouldn't it be a good idea to integrate Mixminion into TOR?
So that every TOR Server could be used optional as a Mixminion Server, too?
The Mixminion Project would probably benefit a lot of it...
What about the possibility to recieve anonymous email via
something at secret-service.onion ?

i didn't find anything in the wiki,
so i hope, that you are able to help...
how may i manually restart tor & privoxy on osx?
i tried:
sudo /Library/StartupItems/Tor/Tor restart
this works, but then it is no background process....
if i'd press ctrl-c to get back to my prompt (or close the terminal.app)
i'd stop
tor again...
any hints?
thanks in advance,

Hi Nick,
Hm! There may be a bug here.  I'll look into it. In the meantime, I'd
suggest you do a separate "start" and "stop" step.
srv-01:~ admin$ sudo /Library/StartupItems/Tor/Tor start
Starting Tor Service

obviously tor is running.. even though i had to brake it up with ctrl-c ?!
the startup script seems to bring it in background on its own....
perhaps there should be a slight change, so that the user dont has to
press "ctrl-c"
on its own to get his prompt back, because he could thing that he broke
up the process :-)

Hi Folks,
at  we offer a wiki based on mediawiki.
so far, we have nearly no content, but i hope, to find some
"experienced wiki-writers" willing to put some content into the securiwiki.
the securiwiki should concern with the following points:
- why cryptography & anonymity
- legal aspects using such technologies (german law)
- howto's (tor installation, configuration, .... / gpg installation,
configuration ... etc).
- everything else that fits to the topic "securi"wiki.
a friend of mine working at a advertising agency will do some artworks
for the wiki, but before he donates his time doing the design,
he wants to see some content ;-)
because this no (mainly) tor specific posting, we should perhaps not
discuss it
on the mailinglist... if you have questions, you may contact me directly
via email
or simply start writing something into the german securiwiki :-)
kind regards,

@_subject: Tor Hardware Router (Tor in a box) 
i talked to some ppl about this point and so far all of them
thought, that it could be a good idea - so i want to present my idea to
you, too.
In my opinion it would be a good thing for spreading tor,
if tor would be easier for end-users.
I imagine an independent tor-router hardware.
for example:
(it is a little embedded pc - quite cheap - form factor of a normal home
use router)
wireless mini-pci cards are optional - so it could be used as a wireless
access point, too.
the whole thing should be configurable via webinterface, like for example
the m0n0wall linux firewall (they also use the wrap hardware):
(see here:  )
features should include:
- webadministration
- possibility to run as server, client, hidden service (forward to local
- built in proxy
- ...
- independent trust system (external directory service or something)
(if the box images would be precompiled they could be more trustworthy,
of course sources should be availiable, too)
only a quick idea - you probably have even more ideas...
perhaps we should look at the m0n0wall project... i think there are some
ideas realized, which could
be used for a tor-in-a-box project, too:
quoute from m0n0wall:
" m0n0wall is probably *the first UNIX system that has its boot-time
configuration done with PHP*,
rather than the usual shell scripts, and that has *the entire system
configuration stored in XML format*."
what do you think?
kind regards,

Dear Adam,
thanks for your response.
It was just a quick idea, to see some reactions.
of course freebsd is not a must.
m0n0wall ( was just an example, because the php /
xml config implementation
is ihmo a good way to solve the configuration etc. of such an "appliance".
perhaps we should as the ppl. at pcengines.ch - they developed this box :-)
another solution would be the net4801 from soekris engineering. (
dont get me wrong.. my initial posting was just to check if there is
a general interest in a "hardware based" solution.
would be a good thing to know, what the devs think about it :-)

Hi Marco,
The WRAP from PC-Engines.ch was just a "lowcost" example (about 150 Euro).
The embedded engines from Soekris.Com have much more power and should
work for a tor-in-a-box-router solution.
have a look here: for example the net4826 would be a good thing.

to the soekris platform, too - so we should be able, too ;-)

Dear Roger, Dear Eugen, Dear List,
although Eugen's idea isn't really a bad one
i see some risks in developing a "commercial part" of the tor system.
Glymr's idea (also on the list) sounds much more compatible with
the open source idea...
What about talking to one of the "big non-profit organisations"?
Like Mozilla Foundation or Canonical Ltd (canonical.com and
Perhaps they would be interested in funding the tor project.
A "Firefox - TOR XPI Plugin" would definitly help to spread
the tor project...
Glymr's idea with a "central donation system - maintained for example by
eff" would be a good thing....
the eff (or another "special tor foundation") could forward funds to
the tor developers and to tor operators to "cover" (or at least help
them) their costs.. etc.

(the latest tor alpha with vidalia 0.0.7 still has this problem)
Unfortunately the trac system of the vidalia systems seems to be down.
the problem was:
"Vidalia seems to assume that the local user is running
Tor and that Vidalia has full control of Tor.  This works well on
Windows, but not unix-like OSes (osx/linux/unix) where Tor is installed
as a separate user and provides ControlPort access via a tcp port."

With Safari there is no real solution (at least i dont know).
you could generate two "profiles" in the osx network configuration.
one with proxy, one without..
the bad thing is.. when changing the profile your connection is cut for some

i just updated to the latest version of tor including vidilia.
unfortunately i cant use vidilia, as vidilia does not recognize that tor

older versions).
when i now try to "start" tor via vidilia i get of course an error msg

should the installer maybe be changed in this point?
maybe it should correct the autostart objects if an older version of tor
is detected.
what is the best option for me to correct this problem?

while reading this:
i had an idea i wanted to share with you.
what about building an dedicated tor operating system.
for example a boot image based on:
preconfigured with disk and swap encryption,
preconfigured with tor running in a chroot... etc.
this would increase tor's security a lot.
maybe servers running this special "tor-linux" could have
their own version number etc... so users have the ability to
check for (at least on the software-side) highly secured nodes.
another benefit:
setting up such a system would be quite easy...
download... burn to a dvd.... but from the dvd..
install... set node name.. etc... done.
what do you think?

This is a good idea.
I had nearly the same.
Maybe it could be solved even easier.
The server-config just needs an option to set "mycountry".
when establishing an onion-route the client should
simply choose an exitnode where mycountry is not equal
to the country of the server he wants to connect.
so.. exitnodes of country a will connect to targets in country b and c
and vice versa.
basically what you suggested, but forced.

But maybe this could be a bad idea anyway.
The investigations will be harder for a foreign country public
prosecutor / police department, but beeing jailed on your next travel

having investigations in your own country (which you are at least able
