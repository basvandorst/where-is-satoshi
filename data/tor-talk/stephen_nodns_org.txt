@_subject: Server Status 'offline' was Re: problems setting up a relay node on win XP 
It takes quite a while until your node becomes more heavily used. Tor
clients take your node's uptime into account when considering whether or
not to route through it. Higher uptime indicates a more stable node,
which will get more traffic.
Thanks Nile. My node's status was advertised as being online for some 3hrs or so until late last night, then the status changed to offline & the status has continued to be advertised as offline despite the fact that my connection has been running non-stop for the last 24hrs. Is this normal, if not do you/anyone else have any advice on what I can do to resolve this? The vidalia bandwidth log indicates that some bandwidth has been used during this time (around 70MB) a small portion of which might have come from utilising tor as a client (I've used Tor as a client only very briefly during the last 24hrs).

Greetings Nile!
There were no error messages in the Tor logs (I'm glad) & Tor does infact seem to be coping with my dynamic IP. After refreshing the IP address on the vidalia settings my node has now remained online for the last 24hrs (reflected also in the Vidalia server stats) so all is now well here!
Thanks again for the help!
Hey Stephen,
Have you looked into Tor's logs for any error messages? I believe you
can access Tor's logs through the Vidalia interface.
Some guesses:
- If you're running a Tor node with a dynamic IP, you should check that
your IP address didn't change.
- Do you have "Address" set in your torrc? It should be set to either a
"fully qualified domain name" (fqdn) or an IP address. If it's not
set, Tor will guess your IP. I'm not sure if Tor can "recover" from
your IP dynamically changing, though.

@_subject: problems setting up a relay node on win XP 
I've used tor as a client for a long time & now I'd like to give something back to the network by running a relay server. I've been following the advice on the tor wiki, specifically "Complete Tor walkthrough for Windows users by Steve Topletz" ( but I'm having some problems! I will attempt to provide an overview of what I have done so far. However, let me be clear, I am NOT in any way a highly advanced computer user & whilst I don't consider this task to be 'beyond me' my lack of technical savvy is almost definitely working against me here (infact this is a learning experience for me), so please bear with me as I attempt to explain my problems.
-postponed opening any ports (explaination below)
1) opened an account with dyndns to create a static ip address/host name
2) configured my hardware firewall (BT Home Hub) with the dyndns account details
3) configured tor as a relay server on windows xp using the vidalia server settings console: (I've chosen to disable the "Mirror the server directory - Directory Port 9030" option because vidalia's help section says this uses more bandwidth & I don't have a lot to play with) & I'm not running tor in the background as a windows service. I've just configured all of the typical settings for a relay node.
re-started vidalia & tor:  the vidalia message log presented me with my tor server indentity key fingerprint & informed me:
"Now checking whether ORPort XX.XXX.XXX.XXX:9001 is reachable..."
"Your server ( XX.XXX.XXX.XXX:9001) has not managed to confirm that its ORPort is reachable. Please check your firewalls, ports, address, etc/hosts file, etc
With regard to port forwarding/opening ports - whilst I've been running tor as a client I've had no problems just allowing it via zone alarm & my hardware firewall (BT Home Hub) hasn't required me to give tor any special permission, tor has just worked. In the set-up that I've described here, Zone Alarm informed me that Tor was attempting to act as a server & I gave it permission to do this. I haven't received any warning messages apart from the one I've detailed already.
Questions: 1) Now that I want to run Tor as a server, do I need to make any changes to zone alarm and my hardware firewall (BT Home Hub) to allow specific ports? In the article I mentioned at the beginning of this mail, the author refers to opening ports 443 & 80.
The BT Home Hub allows me to configure applications stating, "Each incoming port range can be translated into a different internal (local network) port range. Port ranges can be statically assigned to devices or dynamically assigned using an outgoing trigger."
The options I have for configuring applications on the BT Hub are:
protocol (tcp/udp)
port range
translate to internal (local network) port range
trigger protocol (tcp/udp)
trigger port
I'm uncertain of how I should make any configuration on the BT Hub but would appreciate any advice - I've chosen to ask this question here, rather than at a BT forum in case there is something I need to know that's specific to tor.
2) I've used the vidalia console to configure tor as a server. Do I need to make any other changes to the Torrc file (i.e those detailed on the wiki - "Complete Tor walkthrough for Windows users") or is the configuration I've made with the vidalia console sufficient? The settings I've made on the vidalia server settings console remain commented-out on the Torrc file.
Any help would be greatly appreciated & I aplogise again if my lack of knowledge seems retarded!

Thank-you Michael & Ringo for your advice!
Michael: I've followed your advice re: opening ports on the hub & doubled-checked some other issues you highlighted. Well, the vidalia message log says "Self-testing indicates your ORPort is reachable from the outside" and now a bandwidth self-test is underway, a seemingly lengthy process (2.3 hrs so far) I'm assuming that this is normal? My node is now acknowledged in the tor servers list. Thanks again for taking the time to help!

@_subject: locking down windows to run as a server on XP Pro 
I'm currently setting up a Tor server on Win XP Pro.
I have 2 questions:
1. I would like to disable as many unnecessary windows services as possible but would like to check if Tor or the Vidalia bundle implicitly relies on any particular windows services in order to function. Are there any windows services I absolutely should not disable, perhaps services that are maybe not that obvious?
2. Are there any issues with using the Vidalia Bundle/Tor on a computer that is also running PGP Desktop software, that uses whole disk encryption?
Any help/suggestions with these issues would be appreciated!

@_subject: More strange behaviour of Tor 0.2.0.2 Alpha & vidalia 0.0.12 
Here are my experiences, re: strange behaviour of Tor 0.2.0.2 & vidalia 0.0.12 - see also the end of this mail for comments on Rogers mail posted not so long ago!
I was successfully running a Tor relay node on Win XP Pro SP2 for six days using 0.2.0.2-alpha (r10455) & Vidalia  0.0.12 with my bandwidth configured using Vidalia at:
Average Rate: 36 KB/s
Maximum Rate: 40 KB/s
Everything about the connection was working real good. My bandwidth rate was averaging 38/39 KB/s during this time. My dynamic connection maintained the same IP address during these six days. However, when I returned to my machine yesterday morning the connection appeared to have flatlined. It turns out that I could get no connection to the Internet so I re-started my router and re-connected to the net & was assigned a new IP address (nothing unusual there, after all it is a dynamic connection ;) What does seem odd, though, is that when I re-started Tor & it performed the bandwidth self-test it registered my upload bandwidth limit at 21 KB/s rather than the settings I'd configured originally using Vidalia. I've checked my Tor Bandwidth Usage this evening & bandwidth has indeed been used (consistent with a bandwidth rate of 22 KB/s).
Is there anything I can do to ensure my original bandwidth settings are used and not this lesser bandwidth rate? I've read the thread entitled "" & I'm wondering if this might be a similiar kind of problem. The only other possibility that I can think of is that my ISP British Telecommunications ( Bt-central-plus) has been limiting bandwidth usuage of late on the Bittorrent network & I'm wondering if they have done the same thing with my connection now that I've been running my Tor relay for just under a week. This might seem a little paranoid but not beyond the realm of possibility. Would it be worthwhile to run a bandwidth test using my current Tor settings & can anyone recommend me a Tor-friendly bandwidth test?
Any other suggestions/advice would be appreciated!

@_subject: More strange behaviour of Tor 0.2.0.2 Alpha & vidalia 0.0.12  
Just to add to what I posted in my last mail...As I sit here observing the Tor Bandwidth Usage rates, I can see that whilst my advertised bandwidth rate is 22 KB/s, Tor Bandwidth Usage is monitoring sent bandwidth between 28 & 40 KB/s, 40 KB/s being my maximum bandwidth rate. I've observed this for the last 15 minutes, so these higher rates seem to be quite consistent.

I'm new to running Tor as a server. I've recently set up a Tor relay node on Win XP using release 0.1.2.10-rc which I've configured using Vidalia. My node is acknowledged in the list of servers and for a few hours it was advertised as being online but now my server status is advertised as 'offline' even though I continue to run Tor & I am online. Any explanation/advice would be appreciated.

I believe you're talking about the node MrBenn:
If so,
% telnet 86.129.181.33 9001
Trying 86.129.181.33...
It just times out. You (or your ISP, but probably you) are firewalling
incoming connections on this port.
My software firewall (Zone Alarm) was not configured correctly. Having dealt with that I've left my node running & noticed through the course of today that my server status continues to shift between online & offline.   Perhaps you're running a Windows firewall that lets things work for a
little while and then locks them down again?
See above. Hardware firewall configured correctly & no error messages or warnings in the log. (Another option is that your Tor process isn't running anymore, and the
default Windows behavior is to just time out for a port where no process
is listening.)
Don't believe this to be the case. I'm wondering if this problem might be due in part to the version of windows that I'm running (XP Home). I'm thinking of trying to install Tor on another system running XP Pro but I don't know if this is likely to make that much of a difference. From browsing the server list, it would seem that some people are using XP Pro, so maybe this would be a better choice? Any suggestions/advice would be welcome.

@_subject: I break the silence: My arrest 
Because of the terrible threat to civil liberties that currently exists (on several levels) in the UK there are some interesting groups and working relationships that are beginning to establish themselves. These UK groups are also building connections within Europe. Perhaps there is some kind of scope here for Tor Operators who have created their own association, to form some kind of affiliation with other groups that are already actively involved in addressing issues not too disimiliar to those that have affected (and no doubt will continue to affect) Tor Operators. Of course, there would need to be a clear understanding of the goals/objectives of any such association of Tor Operators/Users. The point I am trying to make here has already been made, that there should be some coordinated effort to promote and protect the legitimacy of Tor as a valid and important human rights tool. The shift of emphasis needs to be made, away from all of the negative implications of Tor and back onto the benefits that Tor has to offer. To my mind, this can only really be achieved through some kind of definite, structured, coordinated effort. I would be willing to play my part, here in the UK, where I can. I've included a link to the Open Rights Group by way of example (not promotion per se), to illustrate the point (that has already been made) that many groups already exist with whom an association of Tor Operators/Users could affiliate. This could be done both on a local (National) level and then also in various world regions. EDRI, for example, incorporates the involvement of at least one member of the CCC.    Any comments and further focus/opinion?
