This is just a test; please ignore it. Since I changed my tormail
address from .net to .org & resubscribed to tor-talk from the new
address I'm not getting tor-talk mail in my TBird client.

Thanks, but that wasn't the problem here. In any case, earlier today I
sent a query to the tormail admins, and now the mail is coming through.
I guess the admins fixed something... - eli

@_subject: [tor-talk] No Browser, ContactInfo rewrites? 
[TBB 2.2.35-8 running on Vistax64, with bridge enabled] So, earlier I
noticed a lot of continuous traffic in the Bandwidth Graph, and
ContactInfo in torrc being rewritten periodically:
"ContactInfo  gpg 0xXXXXXXXX" going to variations of
ContactInfo "\"\\\"\\\\\\\" gpg 0xXXXXXXXX\\\"\""
The other thing that's happened is that the browser has disappeared, but
vidalia is still running, and the Message Log shows nothing amiss.
All this during the last 8 hrs or so when the only country reported in
the Bridge Usage Summary was China. (Which I'm suspicious of; usually
over 8 hrs a lot of countries show up in the summary.)
I didn't see any new processes running; cpu load was normal. netstat and
the security log of my browser/router don't show any alarms, not that
I'm very good at recognizing problems there. A partial scan of my
machine (haven't had time to run a full) shows nothing.
Unless I'm misreading a coincidence, I finally stopped the rewriting of
torrc and the high BW use by rebooting the modem gateway, but the
browser is still gone.
I'm going to restart Tor; in the meanwhile, has anyone seen this sort of
disappearance of the browser in TBB? Does the rewriting of ContactInfo
indicate intrusion, or just some screw-up of my own doing? - eliaz

Of what use is a bridge working off an IP address of a provider located
in, say, the US, to a client in, say, Syria? Sorry for the elementary
question. - eli

Thanks for the reassurance about the process. While I accept the
free-speech basis of Tor (that "bad" as well as "good" guys can use it)
and the assumption that the network is overall doing more good than bad,
I've been concerned at the high usage that my bridge seems to be getting
from Syria (& China) when, as you say, for Syria it's not
necessary to hop all the way to the US to reach an entry node. Maybe I
worry too much, since it's neither here nor there to digital comms how
geographically far away an entry node is from a client machine.

@_subject: [tor-talk] how bridges work 
Thanks for the analysis, it's very useful. It raises some questions that
the programmers may want to shed light on.
Based upon my reading of the report, bridge usage greater than the norm
can be due to bridge-harvesting as well as to an increase in legitimate
traffic. Since the Bridge Usage Summary isn't in real time, there's no
point in my changing the bridge address (rebooting gateway) when I see a
bump in the Summary.
But if I ran a dummy client on a different machine, would I be able to
identify harvesters from the message logs? And would it be useful to
then reassign the bridge address?
The other thing and get from the report is that while the harvesters can
identify bridges, they can't uncover the identity the clients using
those bridges. Assuming that the routing algorithm keeps clients
attached to bridges during a IP address change (that is, if it connects
clients to bridge names rather than IP addresses), wouldn't it be useful
for me to reassign my bridge address randomly, without trying to
synchronize with the harvesters? - eli

@_subject: [tor-talk] Legitimate list? 
I hope tor-talk is an appropriate place to post this query.
I've been invited to a mailing list that is purportedly for bridge
runners.  The introduction to the list states:
This list will be devoted to providing TOR bridges to help people in
censored areas reach the free internet. Subscribers to this list can
submit ip addresses and once a week, a limited list of bridges will be
released to subscribers to help people (such as Syrians, Chinese,
Iranian etc reach for these bridges to access the internet.
I know and trust the folks who administer the list server software, but
have no idea who is managing the particular mailing list. I've posted a
query to the list requesting some sort of authentication, but so far
have received no reply.
Should I trust this list with my bridge details?  Can anyone suggest a
method of authentication, other than a facemeet, that I can suggest on
the list?  Finally, if anyone here recognizes the list I'm talking
about, please post your experiences.  Thanks, eliaz

Thanks, it's helpful to know they're not of the Tor Project. Still, they may be people like me, interested in distributing our bridge addressess safely to those who can use them well. The admins at the host have high standards of safety and use for good purposes (or at least purposes that I can agree with). But AFAICT the admins pretty much let anyone set up a list without supplying bona fides (whatever they're worth, on the internet) in advance. I intend to get back to the admins with this question about the list. But before I get ahead of myself & aggravate them, I'd like to be a little more confident that this may be a real problem rather than my overactive imagination. I'll be glad to send Runa the hdr info by PM as SiNA suggests. Let me know if that will be a help. - eliaz

@_subject: [tor-talk] apparent error in TBB 2.2..38-2 
Since loading TBB ver. 2.2.38-2, I notice that when I open & then try to
close torrc in Vidalia I get an 'Error at line one: "" ' message. This
only happens when I attempt to close the editing window by clicking on
OK; when I click on the upper right 'x' the editing window closes as it
should. The contents of the bridge torrc are exactly the same as when I
ran the bridge in previous versions of the TBB and previous
configurations of my machine. The bundle runs fine as a client, but I
still get the annoying error msg when inspecting torrc. I've downloaded,
verified, and run the setup program twice. Running on Vista x64. Can
anyone give advice on how to deal with this error? - eliaz

Thanks, Sebastian. Yes, editing the comment lines out in notepad

@_subject: [tor-talk] Vista DEP and TBB 
I'm writing to ask if there's been some network or server problem the
last few days?  I've run into a variety of error msgs & non-reproducible
difficulties, and before I tear my system apart I want to be sure that's
what I need to do.  Details:
All night the TBB hasn't been able to raise check.torproject.org as it
usually can on startup.  I finally got a couple of other sites up in
other tor browser tabs, along with spurious unsafe-site & other
warnings.  I would assume the problem was at the torproject servers,
except that I've gotten various error messages at various attempts to
log on that say that the problem might be a proxy error in my TBB
configuration, although I'm using the default installation unchanged.  I
still wouldn't worry except that Vista's Data Execution Prevention is
giving me warnings.  Also, the last couple of days my tor e-mail client
(thunderbird) wouldn't send or receive, leading me to think that
something was broken here; but tonight thunderbird has on its own accord
begun behaving as it should. - eli

Thanks, Krishna & Fabian - Yes, it looks like what I thought were
symptoms of a local problem were in fact hiccups in the network. Both
torbrowser & the TB email client have begun to work properly on their
own. My local testing shos nothing amiss. - eliaz

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB ver. 2.3.25-5 install 
[this in Vista x64] I haven't been able to install TBB ver. 2.3.25-5 successfully. The browser comes up but doesn't connect; instead it gives me an error message that it can't find the server. I've had to drop back to 2.3.25-4. The interesting thing is that when check.torproject.org comes up in -4, it doesn't complain about -4 being out of date.
I've had the same results with two separate downloads of the new version. Before I spend more time messing with my setup, I'm wondering if anyone else has run across this problem? - Thanks, eliaz

Thanks, that's a help. I've loaded it successfully on a remote machine.
Won't try it just now on my main machine as I've got a bridge running.
