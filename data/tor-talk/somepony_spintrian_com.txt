@_subject: [tor-talk] TB download improvement 
It's not just ESL, it's the lack of an easy familiar format for communication, support, and dumb newbie questions.  From an outsider perspective, this list is difficult to access and lacks appeal to a greenhorn like myself (it appears to be a hardcore dev talk from the description- you know the kind of place you get bashed for asking newbie questions).  And yet, the next best place I could find seemed like Ask.com
Is there a reason there is not a board or forum for Tor, or that it doesn't come up on Google?  I'm not talking Usenet or IRC, I'm talking something my mother-in-law can find, understand and use.

@_subject: [tor-talk] registration for youtube, 
I just this evening signed up for a google mail account using only the vanilla Tor browser and a random node.
I used a 10 minute email to verify the email account, I was a little surprised it got past google as a valid email domain.  Google did send an email and I used the link, no phone number necessary.
Perhaps your IP was showing from a country google restricts?  I just signed in with my account to verify (incidentally I cannot leave YouTube comments for some reason)
Try again?

@_subject: [tor-talk] keep session for more than 10 minutes 
I too am looking for an answer to this.  Using the vanilla Tor browser your identity changes (based on IP) automatically.  While that enforced anonymity is good in many cases, sometimes it makes a site impossible to use.  Personally for my Tor use I would like it ONLY to switch exit nodes when I hit the Use a New Identity button and on starting Vidalia.
I'm totally new and couldn't find a better solution than Snake Taste.  Is it possible it's this:
*KeepalivePeriod* /NUM/
    To keep firewalls from expiring connections, send a padding
    keepalive cell every NUM seconds on open connections that are in
    use. If the connection has no open circuits, it will instead be
    closed after NUM seconds of idleness. (Default: 5 minutes)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is this a practical vulnerability? 
My question is, if you NEVER requested the 1 web page in the first place, would you have experienced the same attack?  I mean if I were looking for new live Tor services I would probably periodically just roll through unknown IPs and check for a live node (or something) as one layer of attack.  No live node, move on.  Live node not already discovered?  The fact that the node responds (in some manner I'm looking for) is enough information, it's possible I don't even care that it has anything to do with Tor.
Just a thought, it should be clear I have no idea what I'm talking about. e.g. I don't know what your middleman server not getting attacked
