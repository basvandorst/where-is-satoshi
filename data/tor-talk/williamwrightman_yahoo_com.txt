@_subject: [tor-talk] Setting up a Tor relay on the hosting server. 
I have a couple of questions about setting up a Tor relay.? I've read  and  and Here is what I understand happens.? Please correct me if the information below is wrong or could be better managed.
1.Select an hosting company. After you have the OK from them then upload the Tor tarball and untar it.? I think that only Tor is needed when you are operating as a relay (no need for the Vidalia GUI).? So at this point Tor is on the server of your hosting company.
2. Edit the torrc file with the appropriate exit policy.? Obviously you need to put the information in to make sure it is listed as an exit node so it is entered into the directory. 3. I think I am right to say that you could then need to execute the Tor binary. So if you have /home_directory_name/tor then you would presumably need to SSH in and run the binary.? Or would it be easier to setup a cron job so that the binary starts but then stays on permanently?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Setting up a Tor relay on the hosting server. 
I have not as yet purchased hosting so cannot answer the question.? Obviously if Debian is best then I would look for a Debian provider. What I want to do is to buy hosting with an amenable ISP or hosting provider so presumably I would not have root.? I then need to figure the easiest way to have Tor always on.
I imagine the best way of creating the binaries then running Tor is via SSH or perhaps the best way to run it is via cron.
Lets start with: what OS and do you have root on this box? If it's, for instance, a debian based distro then that makes the setup a lot nicer.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is it possible to use Tor and Web-based Messenging 
Hi, A Scroogle search for "messenging online" reveals quite a few services.? However, my experience has been that such services do not work properly with Tor.? I'm not sure why but either I cannot complete the login process or my "buddies" do not appear or suchlike.? All I am trying to do is to login with a Hotmail or Yahoo address then add people, chat, etc.
I realize that I can download Pidgin and suchlike and use them with Tor but (for now at least) I would like to see if I can get web-based chat to work.
If anyone has had positive experiences with any web-based chat / messengering services combined with Tor then please let me know.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hotmail with Tor 
I cannot seem to properly use Hotmail and Tor. I have disabled NoScript and HTTPS-Everywhere but to no avail.
I can login with no problems and see the inbox but when I click on a message then one of two things happens.? Either I get sent back to the "Home" page which shows me the "Hotmail Highlights" or else the page seems to load itself but the message does not get opened.
I have tried with multiple Tor exit nodes.? Same problems. Has anyone else experienced the same issue?? Is their a solution??

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hotmail with Tor 
In my experience, Hotmail simply stopped working with Tor (and the Tor browser) about a month ago. I can view mailboxes, but can't open messages. Not long afterwards, Hotmail also stopped working with Outlook. Presumably the cause is some change to Hotmail. Any thoughts on a work-around?
This is precisely my problem.? I can view the inbox but cannot open any messages whatsoever.? I also wonder if there is a work-around.? Hotmail is a popular service so I would hope that it can be used with Tor.? Also, if the creators of Hotmail have done something so that Tor does not work, surely this means that the same could happen with other sites?

@_subject: [tor-talk] German police keylogger analysis (and the effects on Tor 
Here is an article which details the German federal police's use of keyloggers.
There are also links to Wired's coverage of the FBIs keylogger which are well worth a read.
Keyloggers would, I assume, defeat the whole purpose of Tor since the URL would be recorded and sent to the fedz.
How to overcome?  My impression is that no-one is sending .exe attachments these days but rather exploiting unpatched browsers by tricking people to visiting a site (although of course they can always install it manually).
I suppose that up-to-date anti-virus and anti-malware might help if you are on Windows.  And, of course, using NoScript and blocking Flash and suchlike. What would be the situation if you are using Linux (such as Ubuntu for example).  I realise that keyloggers must exist for Linux but would they be more difficult to install?
Is moving to Linux one solution?

@_subject: [tor-talk] German police keylogger analysis (and the effects on 
I don't really understand the apparent benefit of full disk encryption as opposed to using TrueCrypt partitions. AIUI if you are using FDE then the password is stored in the RAM while the computer is on.
If the computer is seized then the password can be obtained from the RAM.  I base this on Kevin Poulsen's book about Max Vision ("Kingpin") where Vision's FDE password was obtained from the RAM. because he was using the computer when his house was raided.
I would think that using partitions is better.  You use the computer "normally" but if you want to access anything personal then you open the partition.  When you have finished then you close the partition.  Now the password is cleared from the RAM.
Thoughts?

I just checked today and it's still not possible to use Tor with Hotmail.
Does anyone (Andrew, Roger, Mike, etc) know why this is happening?
I realise we cannot expect immediate solutions but I would like to know what the problem is even if there is no immediate work-around.

I was looking at the "bandwidth" graph in Vidalia and there was one thing I did not understand.? I loaded three webpages ( ( and ( I received 6.7MB of traffic (which seems a lot but I guess not when everyone is using broadband) but what I found surprising was that I also sent 3.6MB.
I have no idea why I would be sending so much traffic?
I tried with a couple of other exit nodes and roughly got the same results.

The Telegraph has 331 images. Fetching each one requires that you send a request for it. This request is expanded to a Tor packet, which is 586 bytes including some overhead. That multiplies out to 194 kB. Then each of those connections has to be opened and closed, which takes another two Tor packets per connection. I'm not sure how that works out when many images are on the same site.

I see your point.? So in effect the more graphically intensive the page the more traffic a Tor user is sending.

I don't use Hotmail, but it may / may not be related to javascript.? Either way, make sure that (at least) session cookies are allowed to be set for HM.
-----Cookies work as per usual. For grins, after disabling NOScript, look in about:config, type "javascript" in search, & see if any are still set to deny javascript, even though may have disabled / uninstalled an addon.? Uninstalling them (assume disabling, too) does NOT always reset the preferences they changed back to default.? It should, but doesn't always.
-----I disabled JavaScript and there were a few options that were "false" which I set to true:
However did this not solve the problem - same behaviour as previously. Are you using the same install & same profile of FF w/ Tor, as used for everyday use w/o Tor?? Or is it a separate FF / profile, w/ diff addons or plugins, that you're running w/ Tor?
-----Same as I use for all other Tor browsing. Look at the error console to see what, if any, errors show when trying to load the pages that show basically blank.? AFAIK, if FF has problems w/ a page, it will log errors in error console.
If given option, try changing the viewing mode of msgs to text only.

@_subject: [tor-talk] blutmagie exits shut down 
My fellow citizens,
today blutmagie exits nodes ceased operation.
My special hosting contract providing cheap traffic has been canceled
cause I'm no longer with Telef?nica Germany. Trouble with feds, police,
or the content industry is certainly not the reason. It's only a
question of money to pay traffic market price I can't afford.
Nevertheless many thx to Telef?nica for providing excellent network
services in the last four years.
regards Olaf

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fw: Hotmail with Tor [is their a solution!?] 
Thank you for this advice.
My questions are:
1.	An individual is using Tor, NoScript, HTTPS-Everywhere, Better Privacy, and has no Java, with Flash disabled, and then securely deletes his places.sqlite, cookies.sqlite, etc, files after each session finishes.  Forgive the stupid question but in this case why would TorButton actually be required (for any website)?
"Perhaps it would be useful to email the Hotmail security team and let them know that this isn't going to work very well for people who need security and privacy through anonymity?"
Is this something that would ever be done or considered worthwhile?  Do owners / operators of websites like Hotmail for example care what you have to say or do you just assume they will ignore you so do not bother to contact them?	
Thanks again!
