is there any chance to send an E-Mail message from the Tor network to gmail accounts or any other E-mail service providers ?
Usually each E-mail which is sent from the IP where for example: tor relay is running - is immediately block by the spam filters.
Till now I havent found ane sensible service, from which for example activist will be able to send an E-Mail. As You see, this E-mail has been sent from the protonmail.com. Nice service, but I would never store/send any messages from this website to my enemies or some organizations.
Does Tor has any E-mail System which could be easily use to transfer messages between Tor Network and Internet ? I`m talking about services from which E-mail is accpeted by the providers as gmail, yahoo, hotmail.
Does any one working on it ? Does any one has configured some kind of gateway which can be use to transfer E-mail message from the tor network to the internet ?
I will appreciate any for any infos.

I`m also using Tor + Protonmail.
I thought that there are some exit nodes for SMTP.
Any how, Tor+Protonmail (or some other provider mentioned by Katya) seems to be the best solution.

My target is to create some kind of Tor E-mail service with SMTP/IMAPS service where E-mail could be send in the trusted mode (with DKIM/SPF/DMARC)out and also received and stored for 24h.
This kind of gateway between INternet and TOr is quite risky in my opinion but any how I would like to create it. Webpanel with java script is quite risky, in my opinion simple E-mail command is much more efficient.
What do You think about ?

@_subject: [tor-talk] hidden service - for dummies ? 
today my colleague told me that he would like to start to write some kind of blog and publish it in the tor network. Because I`m not use to say people that I`m using TOR Network, I answered that I simply do not know how its working and who can help him.
My colleague is very good journalist but he doesnt have any IT experience. Every day at work he using some kind of CMS system where he is able to start publishing new articles and so on and so on. Unfortunately as a real normal user (as far as I know) without an IT knowledge, he will not be able to publish his articles in the tor network on his own hidden service. Please correct me if I am wrong...
I know many people with small IT experience which a running relay nodes. This is quite easy process to build new relay. Unfortunately, building of the hidden service portal seems to be that part of the knowledge reserved to the masters of IT.
Is there any free distro like (tails) with a possibility to build TOR Hidden Service in minutes to start publishing html pages ? Distro which can be easily installed/booted by the user with low IT skills ? Distro which will have a properly compiled secure HTTP server with some kind of CMS System ?
Does any one could support / advice here ?
