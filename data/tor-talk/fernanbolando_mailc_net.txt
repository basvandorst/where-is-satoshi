Hi all
In my torrc, in order to use bridges that uses ports other than 80,443
Is it acceptable to simply use
ReachableAddresses *:*
or allowing only specific ports
ReachableAddresses *:9001,*:8080,*:80,*:443

Thanks, Actually openbsd seems to defaults this to
ReachableAddresses *:80,*:443
So when I found it tedious to manually add each of bridge ports and
decided to simply set it to allow everything, got me wondering what
the was the preferred approach.
thanks again

Actually I am probably wrong with that statement. The settings may
have been subsequent updates I did a few years back that I don't
remember anymore.

@_subject: [tor-talk] When to use and not to use tor. 
Hi all
I have seen posts on various websites giving a general rules on when
and when not to use tor. I have seen, however any official
documentation on from torproject or any of the privacy
website like eff. Does such a documentation exists? can somebody point me to it.
dont use tor in banking or financial transactions
dont use tor in non encrypted email

Please note my original intent with I started this thread was to
create a base set of rules for my users to follow to maximimize tor
anonymity and not become a tool against anonymity.
So when I started googling I found suggestions from various mailing
lists and forums, however I could not find anything specifically
suggested by the tor developers or privacy advocate groups like eff.
Another vector I was looking at is to send out a set of suggestion to
the tor button in setting up warnings to prevent users from using tor
incorrectly like.
1. if somebody runs bittorrent traffic send a warning
2. if somebody sends an unencrypted web form through tor send a warning
3. set the always warn unencrypted webpage when tor is enabled.
that said, I did found this
 It forms
a general guideline in using tor. It's not as specific as the ones
from other forums, but it seems to be inline with that.

I think We can target just a set of general users. Like people who are
gun enthusiast or military afficionados
can read about all about those stuff without blipping as dangerous person.
I try to limit myself to educating people, not increase there IQ. If
they chose to
ignore popups and a documented set of guidelines and suddenly a
malicous tor exit
captured there banking password thats up to them.
Yeah, a one size fits all guideline is probably not possible so the
warning from
the tor website will suffice for now.

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor+virtualbox questions 
Hi all
I have seen posts regarding running vmware's networking through Tor,
but have not seen anything specific to what I am doing.
I am running Tor inside a linx virtual machine based on virtualbox,
configured to use bridged network access.  check.torproject.org
happily says i am running tor. So my questions are
1. Does this mean as along as I run the browser from inside the
virtual machine I am safe?
2. Has there been any study whether the host of the virtualbox is
leaking information?
3. We already have usb based torbrowser, I was hoping to use
virtualbox to build usbbased tor operating system package.
Has this been done before? This is so that they can just plug in the
"TorVM Usb" into a spare usb and run a virtual machine,
with access to all the unix tools running through tor.

Yes, this is definitely similar to what I wanted to do, except I was
looking into *bsd as the guest os.
The tails webpage also indicates a similar concern, whether this
actually serves the purpose of anonimity if the host OS is a paid OS
in some publicly accessible computer. I need to read up a bit more.
