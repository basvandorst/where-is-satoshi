Hello Tor,
Despite my check-marking 'Make Tor Browser the Default browser', wherever
I click on a link from an email regular Firefox opens up.
How do I make Tor Browser always be the default?

In my example, I needed to see a link to click. I did from a known link
inside a known email, and so forth .. in a plain-text email at that.
No mater how I get to a link, if it's outside Tor, then regular Firefox
opens and this is a PITA .
in any case, thanks to those who replied and are offering some form of
help. It IS appreciated.

Hello Tor List,
Is there a way I can use the 'Sync' feature, of Tor's browser firefox,
with my other non-Tor Firefox?

Indeed you are correct.
However, I guessed, whether correct or incorrect, that on my home
personal computer it may be a passable solution.
And I discovered a way to do it. Delete previous 'Sync' acct and make a
new one. Then sign all FF browsers up to new one. This then included the
Tot Browser Alpha version of Firefox.
Now if I could get the ubiquitous Adobe-Reader installed I could read the
Bank Statements from online ... they seem to require AR be installed on
some pages and on others I am able to download then read while not in a
Thanks for the time to write a reply to my original query.
