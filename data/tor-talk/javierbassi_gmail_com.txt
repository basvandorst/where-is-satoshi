@_subject: [tor-talk] Torbutton problem 
I had a bit of trouble and a 'wtf moment' with Torbutton yesterday. I
posted the whole story on my blog (in Spanish) but here is a summary
with the idea of what happened:
Summary: yesterday I tried Torbutton in Firefox 3.6.16 (I have both FF
3.6 and 4.0 installed) and after use it for a while I closed FF3. This
morning I opened FF4 and it was still using tor proxy, even with
Torbutton addon disabled (because not being compatible with FF4). I
didn't know it was still using tor proxy and almost log in to a non
https website. I think Torbutton should autodisable itself and return
network settings to default when closing FF.
I have been running a relay for a while but never tried Torbutton so
this was like the first steps with it:
blog post in case someone speaks Spanish:

The problem is that there might be a situation in which you are using
tor network without knowing. It's ok for the plugin to modify settings
as long as the plugin is enabled. If we went back to FF3 just to use
torbutton, when we go back to FF4 proxy settings are still set to use
port 9050 and plugin is disabled. Once you realize it there is no
danger, but if you don't know, you could be sending private data
through tor using http. I don't know if I'm being clear.

When you install them just choose two different directories. Make sure
the user you will use to run them have privileges to modify the files
inside the directories so they can update.
Use firefox -profilemanager to create two profiles.

Also now you must verify your cel via SMS in order to create an

I also can't see country flags with Vidalia 0.2.12 in linux. The logs
don't say anything about it.
I use TorStatus if I need the flags for something.

@_subject: [tor-talk] no country flags in Vidalia 2.10 
I have just added torproject urls to sources.list and installed
tor-geoipdb from deb.torproject.org (lucid). It still doesn't work
when I open vidalia. I think the problem could be that I didn't
install vidalia from the package manager. I downloaded a tar.bz file,
extracted it and I'm using it from my /home.
Anyway I wanted the flags some days ago to see if there was any Tor
Exits from Argentina with the Tor Exit message on port 80 and email
address to contact them and ask them if they had any trouble with ISPs
here. About a month ago I started running an exit node from home and
wanted to know if there was any history here. So I check with
TorStatus and it seems I'm the only one using "This is a Tor Exit
Router" message on :80.

A tor exit node will not be able to produce a dime this way because
its always the same IP that is watching/clicking ads (his own ads) so
the clicks will not count or the account will get banned in all
adsense services.
Still, changing links to amazon, ebay and other similar websites by
adding the referral/tag of the tor exit node owner could produce
income, regardless the IP. But who browse the internet for shopping
via tor?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hijacking Advertising to give a Tor Exit node 
Didn't know about AnchorFree. I don't know how can the advertisers
distinguish between impressions/clicks from different users if they
have the same IP. They have to trust that they are not one AnchorFree
employee refreshing the page with a script that changes the user
In our case, it would be difficult for Tor to build that trust because
it will depend on each exit node.
Quick question: can middle nodes modify traffic? If thats the case we
have a bigger problem.

@_subject: [tor-talk] EFF Tor Challenge 
By now you all probably know about the EFF Tor Challenge to increment
the number of relays:
I think its a great idea like most EFF's campaigns .
You can see in their list that most people (including myself) choose
to setup a middle node instead of an exit node, and that's the safest
choice for setting up a relay in your home.
I thought home PCs should run a middle node while servers from
important organizations, universities and news agencies should ran an
exit node.
I have to say I felt a bit disappointed when I saw that the EFF was
also running a middle node. I thought they would be running the
openest exit node. I know that they are not encouraging people to run
exit nodes. But if they do not setup an exit node, who will? I saw
some comments on reddit about this.
Does anyone else feels the same?

What is think he is trying to say is that if someone finds a security
vulnerability in Tor/Vidalia (this has happened in the past) the
attacker can easily have a list of all IPs running relays, and may
compromise all their machines with his 0day. And also he mention that
even if Tor is chrooted, the attacker can break out of the chroot
jail. This is not as easy as it sounds. To break out of the chroot
jail you need to escalate privileges first and how do you get root
inside a chroot jail? ( Of course if Tor was not running as root)

Yeah, thats why I found his argument strange and said 'I think he's
trying to say' although maybe he's not. But if he is, then a browser
or any app that use Internet is as 'insecure' as Tor.

January 2011. Seriously? By then I'm sure his gmail account was
already full of non-secret/non-important emails and pictures of

Julian email him directly to j at 203.113.128.15 or something like that.
His secret data is probably in a box with a TrueCrypt hidden volume,

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor exit+proxy 
A few thoughts on this user-->Tor-->open_proxy-->website chain. The
main reason why very few people run exit nodes is because abuse
complaints and raids.
If for example a tor exit node exiting only on port 80, could relay
all its traffic through an open proxy (or many open proxies), then the
abuse complaints will go to the open proxy admin and not to the tor
exit node admin. You would think that the open proxy admin will
redirect the abuse complain to you, or give your IP to the feds.
Maybe, but maybe not. Open proxys admins probably handle much more
abuse complaints than tor exit node admins. They will probably ignore
it. Some will not, but in the end the exit node admin will receive
much more less complaints.
This will not only help in recruiting new exit nodes but also making
some middle switch to exit. With more exit nodes the bottleneck effect
will decrease (at the expense of having a larger circuit)
About anonymity, it will be the same. Its the privacy that will get
reduced. (anonymity != privacy). Because, as hmoh said, there will be
two servers who can log and tamper your cleartext traffic. They will
not be able to tell who you are, only what are you doing. Anyway, if
you are using plain HTTP you should already assume you are having zero
privacy, using or not Tor. So its the same.

I meant case 1).
I have absolutely zero knowledge of US law. I don't know if
hidemyass.com are getting into trouble for posting a list of open
proxies. Sometimes this kind of stuff get fixed with a disclaimer, but
that's up to Tor team and their lawyers to decide. After all, law is
just one more protocol.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Google as default search engine revisited 
I agree with Eitan, google via Tor is not a threat to anonymity. Maybe
to privacy, as Kammerer said, Google knows which results you click but
doesn't know who clicked them. So privacy is decreased but anonymity
is not threatened.
But looking at this with a different angle. Google search performance
over Tor is horrible. Google instant (a so called "feature" that makes
a request with each letter you type  and starts giving you results
before you finished typing what you want to search) is quite annoying
without using Tor. With Tor, is unusable. Run HttpFox or something and
take a look at the number of requests when searching. That's why I
like Scroogle, one request, one reply.
Moving away from Google as default search engine will not only improve
TBB's user experience but also will reduce a the number of connections
out there, and that helps the network.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Google as default search engine revisited 
You raised a valid point. Although I have looked at the sent requests
and they don't collect the necessary information for this attack, they
could. And although a statistical attack applying keystroke dynamics
with their billion monthly unique visitors is practically impossible,
it is theoretically possible. This theoretical threat to anonymity
should be enough to make TBB devs move away from Google (or at least
remove google.com in NoScript's default whitelist)
