@_subject: Update to default exit policy 
I'm not clear on how authentication (on any port) stops spam,
other than the ISP cutting off a given userid after complaints.
A lot of spam already comes from malware infected computers via their legitimately configured email.
Those computers are probably not using Tor, let alone transparent proxy, but malware could grab their credentials and then use Tor on another host to send out spam over port 587,
if that port was allowed in exit policies.

@_subject: Need help with MPAA threats 
It is unlikely that the content in question was ever on your computer at all,
because Tor does not transfer UDP packets (used by bittorrent for data) and the default exit policy rejects the common bittorrent ports.
The MPAA investigators are likely seeing the Tor users' access to the tracker website
which is done via http.
However, imo your best legal course in USA is as phobos suggested.
I'm in Canada, where the DMCA does not really apply, but my network provider was getting annoyed receiving DMCA notices every day
and threatening to cut off my server.  The template letter i adapted from Torproject and
was sending to the DMCA complainants (cc my network provider) was not enough
because it did not stem the tide of notices.
I thought about getting a cease-and-desist order against the complainants
but i have no idea how (and no money) to go about international legal actions.
After looking at several dozen automated DMCA letters, i noticed that all but a few point to tracker websites for ThePirateBay.
I decided to add the ip addresses for those tracker websites to my reject list
and have not received a DMCA notice for a few weeks now.
Although this technically rejects some web (http) traffic,
it seems to me just an extension of the exit policy rejecting bittorrent ports
because those tracker ip addresses are primarily used for setting up p2p transfers.
I'm paying $100 a month in bandwidth fees to facilitate anonymous communication for activists etc - not to subsidize consumption of games and movies.
Yes i know p2p can carry all sorts of content;
if there is lots of "legitimate" stuff available via ThePirateBay my attitude could change.
Feedback on this is welcome.

@_subject: SSH and Telnet ports 
SSH password attacks from single sources can be deterred with watcher programs such as Fail2Ban which modify the firewall to discard connections from an offending ip address after a chosen number of login failures for a chosen period of time (e.g. 1 hour).
Some have suggested rate limiting new connections using iptables rules as well.
To counter this, SSH crackers devised distributed attack schemes
which try login only a few times from each of many different ip addresses.
However there are now also distributed versions of the watcher software
(  )
which pool the information about attackers and victims.
The latency from Tor wouldnt bother either sort of attacker,
but concentration of attack ip addresses via exit nodes might counter the distributed aspect
(until such time as we reach a much larger population of exit nodes).
It might be interesting to see how many ip addresses listed at DenyHosts are Tor exits.

It was in the news today that RIAA is switching strategies
away from suing individuals toward pressuring ISPs.
In USA the EFF might help with legal defense if you are sued or charged,
but that doesnt preserve your server or internet connection if your ISP just cuts you off.
Read your Terms and Conditions and Acceptable Use Policy and switch providers if necessary.
Help lobby against big government and fascist (corporate+police/military) states, etc.
Encourage everyone to use Free Software and strong encryption, and produce works licensed CC-by-sa.
What else can we do?
Nevertheless, some Tor operators (myself included) do so for specific reasons.
We might not help at all if we could not choose our exit policies.
Some who don't want to deal with complaints choose to run middle nodes.
I'm grateful for every byte of bandwidth.

@_subject: [OT] message formats (was: browser footprint) 
Supporting only ASCII (which essentially means English-only) in this day and age is a form of cultural imperialism.  Tor needs users in every country, in every language, to be fully effective and available.
So even if we speak only English on this listserv, it would seem inappropiate to fault people for using standards-compliant unicode-capable mailers,
or ask them to override default behaviour of their software to support apps on legacy proprietary operating systems.
Source code is available for other mail packages for Solaris,
as well as packages like GNU recode.
If you choose not to use one, then in the rare case someone posts
a base64-encoded message on a subject of interest, you could ask someone to send you the trancoded message.

AVG (and other antivirus software) inserts a proxy that catches the email traffic you mention.
The risk with any examining or altering of traffic is that you may be giving up your legal and moral claim to status as a common carrier or safe harbour
which is perhaps the only thing protecting you from DMCA and other prosecution in the USA.
Microsoft and friends recommend against email scanning
at least for your own email as it may confuse your email software and cause corruption
and you are protected anyway due to the antivirus software's file access scanning.
Thirdly the default exit policy does not allow exit to port 25
because it can be used by spammers and worms and your ISP may cut off your access as it will think you are the source.

@_subject: No Tor server exists that allows exit to 127.0.0.1:80. 
[snip] That could be caused by someone mapping certain domains to 127.0.0.1 in their local DNS service,
which when returned would cause your browser or http-proxy to request a document from localhost.
I used to map doubleclick.net to 127.0.0.1 in my router, for example.
Some malware and anti-malware software makes that kind of mapping in the Windows hosts file.
Thus i don't think a Tor node is doing it, though from a client point of view
one might consider a Tor exit node and its DNS as a single service.
Perhaps it could be logged at the exit node itself as a possible misconfiguration warning.
You can see your current exit node using Vidalia.
I don't know how to find out past exit nodes, or if it is a bad idea to keep that kind of info around.

The hardware on which the high speed internet runs is increasingly concentrated
under fewer owners.  How many internet access providers exist where you live
and do they significantly differ in Terms of Service, i.e. friendly to privacy?
Google alone now carries from 6 to 10% of all the traffic.
viz. The laws governing (or attempting to) what is allowed on the internet
are also swinging in favour of more control and traceability.  Indeed, if the ACTA currently being negotiated is implemented,
Tor could well become illegal, (a) because it can be used to circumvent
restriction of copyrighted content by country and (b) because you can use it
to hide identity while filesharing (even though we discourage that).
EFF and friends succeeded in repealing some PATRIOT act insanity,
but national insecurity and corporate greed continue to infect
all areas of law and social reality including the internet.

@_subject: StrictNodes 
clearly needs updating.
In the Changelog entry for 0.2.2.7-alpha - 2010-01-19 it says
  o Major features (relay selection options):
    - Switch to a StrictNodes config option, rather than the previous
      "StrictEntryNodes" / "StrictExitNodes" separation that was missing a
      "StrictExcludeNodes" option.
    - If EntryNodes, ExitNodes, ExcludeNodes, or ExcludeExitNodes
      change during a config reload, mark and discard all our origin
      circuits. This fix should address edge cases where we change the
      config options and but then choose a circuit that we created before
      the change.
    - If EntryNodes or ExitNodes are set, be more willing to use an
      unsuitable (e.g. slow or unstable) circuit. The user asked for it,
      they get it.
    - Make EntryNodes config option much more aggressive even when
      StrictNodes is not set. Before it would prepend your requested
      entrynodes to your list of guard nodes, but feel free to use others
      after that. Now it chooses only from your EntryNodes if any of
      those are available, and only falls back to others if a) they're
      all down and b) StrictNodes is not set.
    - Now we refresh your entry guards from EntryNodes at each consensus
      fetch -- rather than just at startup and then they slowly rot as
      the network changes.

If you want a serious answer, please cite the sources of those several opinions.
Then someone can refer you to the appropriate paper or FAQ where that opinion has already been discussed, or if a new weakness has been found then folks in Tor Project can analyze and add it to the priority tasks to fix.
If you are wondering whether to rely on Tor for your purposes, read the documentation about how it works and ask questions about specific aspects that you don't understand.  Also ask knowledgeable people you already trust to help you understand,
but be aware of any conflict of interest someone giving an opinion may have.
There are many parts of Tor and its associated software that use encryption,
and in each part the designers try to make it as strong as possible
while still keeping the software usable and performing well enough for its intended users - the people identified in the Who Uses Tor web page.

I'm not sure why there would be leaks with ABP.  Afaik it doesnt send information.  However it does update its blocklists which might be language-specific, which splits the anonymity set (if i understand the concept).
Regarding use of ABP itself among non-Tor users, i have personally installed it on hundreds of computers every year while servicing them and updating Firefox. So i am sure the user base is at least as large as the TBB user base.
Perhaps there is a concern about ability to fix vulnerabilities in the code - who will do that and maintain it.  Do they accept patches?  It seems to use Mozilla Public License.
ABP itself has changed default policy to accept some simple text ads, on the grounds of keeping small well behaved websites alive.  Should we be worried about ad-revenue corruption and creep?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Bridges from Tor-net? 
"There are a few reasons we don't:
a. We can't help but make the information available, since Tor clients
need to use it to pick their paths. So if the "blockers" want it, they
can get it anyway. Further, even if we didn't tell clients about the
list of relays directly, somebody could still make a lot of connections
through Tor to a test site and build a list of the addresses they see.
b. If people want to block us, we believe that they should be allowed
to do so. Obviously, we would prefer for everybody to allow Tor users
to connect to them, but people have the right to decide who their
services should allow connections from, and if they want to block
anonymous users, they can.
c. Being blockable also has tactical advantages: it may be a persuasive
response to website maintainers who feel threatened by Tor. Giving them
the option may inspire them to stop and think about whether they really
want to eliminate private access to their system, and if not, what
other options they might have. The time they might otherwise have spent
blocking Tor, they may instead spend rethinking their overall approach
to privacy and anonymity."

Both hidden and clearnet services can gather information to build profiles of their users over time, and try to correlate it with information from other services.  What is stopping the operators from exploiting that information contrary to interests of the users?
In the clearnet case, operators are accountable for their public promises and by established norms and legalities of internet behaviour.  Their reputation in other areas could be damaged by a scandal in one service.
In the hidden case, there is no accountability at all, which leads to quite a temptation.  Of course selling or using the information risks revealing where it came from, but because users wanted to be anonymous they may not have the means or the will to go after the operators.  This is the dynamic with, for example, underground railroads. (Not saying hidden services are necessarily illegal.)  If Tor users are careful, there is not much information the operator would be able to gather and exploit though.

user should have to go through captchas every session, even if their ip
address changes. In TBB the captchas can timeout before we even get a
chance to see them. Secondly, if they are going to use them, i wish they
would pick something a human can read which this often isnt:
or use a different method such as math questions or pick-a-kitten.
Thirdly, i started seeing these notices about reading from a canvas
recently: Is this due to a TBB missing feature or did Youtube use something in
HTML5 on purpose that violates privacy, e.g. is this a replacement for
the evil hidden Adobe flash storage?
Basically these changes plus the inability to view or even download
videos with ads on them (Adobe Flash only), means they are squeezing out
Tor users, and anyone else concerned with privacty and security.  It
bodes ill for TBB's uptake by the masses.

Tor Project goes to some lengths to make it clear that exit nodes
intentionally store no client data. If some were to start caching the
others would become more vulnerable to confiscation because they also
might be caching. It doesnt matter what sort of data is involved.
Even when there is a cache, the browser (or caching proxy) still has to
hit the destination site to check if the data changed. Any site that
serves a lot of similar data should have its own optimization or caching
at the front end.
Exit nodes serve many sorts of clients, so any caches would be flushed
too often to be useful.  A given user's requests might also span more
than one cache because the exit node can change during browsing activity.
They would get blacklisted.

There is nothing but ethics stopping the operators of exit nodes from
trying to watch your traffic. Therefore, if you are worried about
privacy, you should assume that they will try and ensure all your web
traffic is encrypted with SSL. Then the exit node operators will only be
able to see which sites you connect to, not the content of that traffic.
This was explained in the 2nd link provided below.
In addition, because of the Tor network design, the exit operators
cannot know the origin of the traffic, so they will not know it was you,
just that some computers were connecting to the destinations they observed.
Exit nodes that alter content are flagged as "BadExit", if someone
reports them or the automated scanner catches them. (Suggestion: a rouge
colour could be applied to their icons in any node listings.)
However, if you do not read the instructions and warnings that appear on
your screen, the likelihood is close to 100% that your computer is

conventional discrete-log-based systems over elliptic-curve systems; the
latter have constants that the NSA influences when they can."
and in Wired [2]:
Breakthroughs in factoring have occurred regularly over the past several
decades, allowing us to break ever-larger public keys. Much of the
public-key cryptography we use today involves elliptic curves, something
that is even more ripe for mathematical breakthroughs. It is not
unreasonable to assume that the NSA has some techniques in this area
that we in the academic world do not. Certainly the fact that the NSA is
pushing elliptic-curve cryptography is some indication that it can break
them more easily.
If we think that?s the case, the fix is easy: increase the key lengths.
The NSA can make use of everything discovered and openly published by
the academic world, as well as everything discovered by it in secret.
Assuming the hypothetical NSA breakthroughs don?t totally break
public-cryptography ? and that?s a very reasonable assumption ? it?s
pretty easy to stay a few steps ahead of the NSA by using ever-longer
keys. We?re already trying to phase out 1024-bit RSA keys in favor of
2048-bit keys. Perhaps we need to jump even further ahead and consider
3072-bit keys. And maybe we should be even more paranoid about elliptic
curves and use key lengths above 500 bits.
Are there some assurances that Tor is using the best parameters on its
symmetric, public key and curve cryptography?  And how can we check?

Sure, but it isnt so black and white.  Just as with media funding, the
stories that are aired arent necessarily false or propaganda - such

the choice of *which* stories to post and which ones to omit and which
ones to put investigative resources into, *is* heavily influenced by
funding - otherwise known as setting the agenda.
Tor Project had to refuse funding from a donor who was deemed some kind
of enemy of the US govt[1].  This should raise suspicions that the
project may not be developing in its most productive direction(s) for
the other parties that could or do use Tor (e.g. hidden service
operators, copyright pirates, anti-capitalists, whistleblowers, enemies
of the US govt).  (Despite the idealism, good reputation and best
intentions of various Tor Project members.)  It isnt just a matter of
looking for bad code or design decisions, we should look at what code
isnt there or what other non-code aspects of the project arent covered well.
As Moritz Bartl suggested recently, a second pool of funding and centre
of development expertise outside US influence would remedy the potential
problem of (interested portions of) the US govt setting the agenda,
broaden the base of support, and perhaps even reduce some of the trolling!

Tor cannot encrypt connections beyond the exit node - that is your

computer isnt encrypted with something at least as strong as SSL, then
the exit node operator and anyone else watching traffic coming out of
the exit node can see the contents.  With hidden services, however, the

@_subject: [tor-talk] Blacklists 
The FAQ gives 3 reasons why Torproject doesnt encourage that particular
solution to blocking of Tor:
To quote therefrom:
a.    We can't help but make the information available, since Tor
clients need to use it to pick their paths. So if the "blockers" want
it, they can get it anyway. Further, even if we didn't tell clients
about the list of relays directly, somebody could still make a lot of
connections through Tor to a test site and build a list of the addresses
they see.
b.    If people want to block us, we believe that they should be allowed
to do so. Obviously, we would prefer for everybody to allow Tor users to
connect to them, but people have the right to decide who their services
should allow connections from, and if they want to block anonymous
users, they can.
c.    Being blockable also has tactical advantages: it may be a
persuasive response to website maintainers who feel threatened by Tor.
Giving them the option may inspire them to stop and think about whether
they really want to eliminate private access to their system, and if
not, what other options they might have. The time they might otherwise
have spent blocking Tor, they may instead spend rethinking their overall
approach to privacy and anonymity.

4) have a single TBB with separate tabs or windows open, and each window
connects to a separate 3rd party vpn or proxy (to get a different ip
address), and then to the destination.
5) if you dont care about "relatively good" anonymity, run multiple Tor

Actually, the police had it right.  The only way police could know
whether the exit node operators were the source of the CP traffic was to
search their computer.  An exit node is indistinguishable from the
computers that it is acting the proxy for (barring ip leaks), from the
destination site's point of view.  Their own traffic would be mixed in
with exit node traffic.
Somewhere is a piece of advice from TorProject recommending people not
to run an exit node from home for the above and other reasons.

The main "other" reason i was thinking of is that the ip addresses of
Tor relays, especially exit nodes, are blocked from many services such
as IRC and Wikipedia, and by third party filter software.  The
knowledgeable relay operator can work around this of course, but the
rest of the household may not be so flexible.
Two other problems, easily remedied with a little money:
1) cheap home internet connections are not usually allocated a static ip
address so your relay may not accumulate enough uptime to get traffic
routed to it.
2) home internet connections typically have much faster download than
upload bandwidth, and your relay is limited by the lower one.
The fellow in Seattle gave the police his passwords to avoid having all
the hardware seized.  Again, is that something you want to risk for the
other denizens of the house, or your own other equipment?

More importantly, anytime a user logs into any Google account via a Tor
exit noe, they run the risk of that "something suspicious" screen and a
demand from Google that they verify their account using a different
means such as SMS or voice.  Many users will not have a voice or SMS
service handy to verify with.
If their normal home connection becomes known as an exit node, users
could be very much inconvenienced, and not just when accessing Google.
It does not matter if the exit node was ever implicated in some abuse -
merely being listed is enough to get banned from many websites and other

1) Ensure javascript is not needed to use the site, and tell users so.
2) Ensure there are no offsite images dynamically included, and no
dependencies on other domains (e.g. wordpress, google fonts).
3) good quality SSL certs from e.g. Lets Encrypt, with instructions how
users can verify.
It might look more "primitive" but the content is what users come for.
For months i have been suggesting to friends and clients, who are

Once enough people get used to rejecting 3rd party ads and snooping,
