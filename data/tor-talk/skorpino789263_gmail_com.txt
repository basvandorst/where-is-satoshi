False! A unique Tor exit IP that visits site1.com then site2.com won't
compromise same person visited those sites or tow different person who
used same Tor exit IP at the same time did that, thus anonymity
remains true.
Browser Add-ons can change actual view size to anything we plan.
That is correct. But a Tor user who temporarily use a natural
fingerprint to become undetectable for a while won't deanonymize
itself nor the rest of other Tor users who use a detectable version of
TBB because when a natural fingerprint is used once then there will be
no enough information available for data miners to link pseudonyms for
deanonymization, and for sure Tor users who need undetectability won't
use the undetectablizer Add-on all the time hence detectable TBB users
won't become unique.
Undetectability is a crucial requirement for privacy protection tools
and unfortunately seems that Tor developers don't wanna put their time
on this issue. I hope other folks take this problem serious and do
something quickly.

As I said it won't happen. It doesn't make sense to use
undetectableizer when using a public Tor exit node because that will
compromise you are using Tor thereby minority of undetectable users
won't hurt anonymity of major detectable users nor themselves.
undetectablizer Add-on is useful for private exit nodes. just think of
how Tor bridges are shared with users privately to prevent China
harvest and block all of them, a similar list can be provided by Tor
community or other groups to share private exit nodes after paying
some Bitcoins and anyone can mine Bitcoins anonymously by doing
computer works after a few days.
Undetectability is necessary but occasional. Most of the time you
don't need to be undetectable when searching websites or visiting
social networks but if attacker detect that someone is trying to hide
it's identity when entering a powerful vile's email account or when
trying to contact a high risk journalist, that might cost lives.
Yes. Using a randomized profiles each time user clicks on
UnidentifiableMode can solve reusing same unique fingerprint problem
however I prefer use common profiles that we have in mobile devices
because a lots of people are using them and they all have same
fingerprint. it would be a large haystack for hiding, if I several
times check same account from there I still look natural.
There are limited numbers of data requests possible (check out
browserleaks.com or browserspy.dk). We need list all of them and
compare with other browsers to spoof what is different.
You say that in UnidentifiableMode before closing the browser and
getting a new identity, opening different sites in different tabs can
be correlated to each other which is true if user choose a randomized
fingerprint however if a common fingerprint like mobile devices is
chosen then that correlation between different tabs becomes
UnidentifiableMode is used in rare scenarios, in a dialog we can
inform users what happens when they activate it. At the moment If you
maximize TBB a message pop up and inform you that this action makes
you vulnerable to tracking.
I don't understand what do you mean by ?clearnet fingerprint? ?
Fingerprint is generated locally inside the browser, it is about TBB
not the onion routers. Connecting to a website directly or via a
public Tor exit node as proxy gives one bit of information (true or
false flag) to destination website but we don't include this bit in
the fingerprinting attack.
As far as I know you can't fetch installed Add-ons by javascript, it
only works for plugins so it is not detectable either. Detecting
Add-ons is done by side channel attacks, for instance Adblock prevent
certain scripts or Noscript prevent certain objects, attacker can
simply call such elements and find out those Add-ons are already
installed or not.
We just change details a browser return to calls in a way that caller
can't recognize it is telling the truth or not. there is no need to
block things however the "resource://" should go away, it tells
everything even the exact Tor version you are using now. of course it
won't cause a detection if user choose a mobile device profile as
safari don't have such a thing.
Using a common fingerprint (e.g mobiles) all the time can solve this issue
In a public wifi hotspot there is only one IP address and several
clients simultaneously visit different websites. It would be very
difficult for an attacker to find out a private Tor exit node is
actually a Tor exit node and what we want is to prevent websites be
able to instantly detect Tor like today. Don't forget that it is not
impossible to locate a user if a global adversary observe a big
portion of globe and deanonymize Tor itself but we still trust Tor for
anonymity thus we can trust undetectablizer Add-on in most of cases to
remain unidentifiable either.
What? Undetectabilizer Add-on's aim is exactly hiding that we're using
Tor from the destination site. Pluggable Transports aim to hide that
we're using Tor from network observers located between user and
Making undetectablizer Add-on is a trivial task. It took several years
for Tor devs to show up a warning message when user try maximize it's
browser. It was a trivial task too but they are busy with other things
and don't have enough resource to do more good stuff. I hope they run
a kickstarter campaign very soon or some other folk help out make this
Add-on happen.

A private Tor exit node is not listed in consensus. And there is no
need to use a private exit node for undetectability, we can simply use
a public exit node that is connected to a socks proxy server thereby
destination site can't see exit node's IP address and match it with
If we use a socks proxy server to talk with destination instead of a
private Tor exit node then such an attack becomes as dangerous as when
you are using a detectable TBB over a public Tor exit node because the
number of socks proxies available out there won't be less than public
Tor exit nodes today.
in UnidentifiableMode if you use a randomized fingerprint then you are
unique until you close your browser and during that session different
sites you open in different tabs can identify same person is visiting
these sites but if you use a common fingerprint like a mobile device
that is same for everyone then you are not unique among undetectable
It's really impractical to ask a friend install a RAT and let me
backconnect to surf the Internet using his web browser. We can patch
TBB or create an Add-on that let anyone in special cases easily visit
destination sites anonymously and invisibly.
Why not expand those few benefits into more awesomeness?
Yes we can hide that fact from endpoints. at least we can prevent them
use an automated system to instantly find out the answer like today.
Tor is not perfect but still we can rely on it.
If you give us only one practical example that let destination sites
automatically separate TBB from vanilla Firefox or safari then we
forget about it but don't try throw your fallacies about what global
adversaries can do because nobody expect Tor to be perfect.

high latency doesn't mean proxy, a lots of gamers have high latency
problem just because of their poor ISP and many others complain about
slow ping because of their heavy Firewalls. even if destination
presume that a proxy or VPN is used, still in many different cases it
is much better than detecting that user is behind Tor. I remember some
NSA documents about targeting anyone who simply surfed Linux journals
but they didn't the same thing with Apple/Microsoft gossip sites. A
little bit change can make a lot of difference...
why you think we are limited to less than ~999 possible proxy?
We have nothing to lose. you are saying that if we fail they detect
that we used Tor but with current TBB setup they instantly detect that
we are using Tor.
Today all TBBs return same fingerprint, we just replace that value
with what iphones generally have. You might say socks proxy part for
exiting a Tor exit opens a new door for attackers.
When you normally use Tor your route is
is an IP address that doesn't change but ExitNode randomly changes
based on what is available. When we use a proxy/VPN before
DestinationSite we talk to DestinationSite with same IP address until
session fully ends, as any normal user always do. We want make sure
that this property can't deanonymize user itself or other Tor users.
1-as I said UnidentifiableMode is not made for everyday life, we only
use it for custom plans so we shouldn't open other tabs when doing
that, that means we won't open a real facebook profile in a different
session while in another session try contact with Guardian. This
manner foils associating anonymous sessions to unanonymous sessions.
note that if UnidentifiableMode fails to work as we expect, it only
makes user detectable and distinguishable from other users, it doesn't
leak the real location. nothing to lose here. If you are worry that
attacker look at entry-exit points of connection for correlating
traffic and deanonymizing the location then it can happen even if you
don't use any proxy to talk with destination, when your exit changes
frequently there is even more chance for attacker to finally get you
at one of his compromised exit points to deanonymize your circuit by
timing attacks.
in future versions we can let user import several proxies and use each
one for every different DestinationSite. So we can search google or
see cat videos while in a different tab write a blog post.
2-Whether undetectable TBB fails or win, it doesn't hurt detectable
TBB users if population of detectable TBB users remain almost as large
as it is today. According to what UnidentifiableMode is created for,
invisible users will be the minority in the Tor community hence
detectable TBB users won't be effected by undetectable TBB users.
How difficult is disabling Noscript or HTTPSEverywhere? Before
activating UnidentifiableMode we can tell user watch out the address
bar for https sign as they always do in regular browsers and instead
of blocking WebGL or canvas we can intercept calls to canvas read
function and return a normal response (if we are going to impersonate
iphones then that value would be same for everyone as all iphones are
same device)
if you write it for me i appreciate that :)
Therefore all undetectable users will have same fingerprint. In
ordinary TBB today all users have same fingerprint too but in
undetectable TBB instead of a suspicious Firefox fingerprint that is
black listed everywhere they will look like a natural iphone browser
that is used by many others elsewhere. For the time zone we should use
something more natural, I recommend EST as default for everyone and
allowing users to replace that value with a different common zone if
they needed.
And Tor devs don't need to do anything else. Finding a bridge for
entering the onion network or a socks proxy server to exit the pool is
on users who want hide their Tor from local authorities or destination
websites. They only need fix TBB, I guess by creating an Add-on. And
there is no need to make this Add-on built-in, we can ship it only to
those who want it as an experimental tool like OONI
in torproject's front page in side bar it says ?Who Uses Tor?? and
half of those groups need undetectability :))
Invisible mode have much more importance than bypassing verification
after opening accounts although the most common use case seems to be
bypassing flags. If you wear a mask and try go to shopping it clearly
cause problem but when you try talk to people about state oppression,
a mask put you in serious trouble and hiding your mask from a
government is much more difficult than hiding it from a drug store.
If 1 billion person use TBB it doesn't mean TBB becomes undetectable.
That Mozilla project have nothing to do with undetectability (I'm
afraid they even don't know what is detectability problem in TBB).
they just want add Tor in private browsing mode for extra security
because current Firefox private mode is snake-oil. In the wiki page
they mention we should fix fingerprinting problem. Their solutions
finally makes their private mode detectable as TBB became.

You say that if NSA detect my Tor and automatically hack me then it's
only between me and NSA. Yes you are right but Tor can save me if they
hide me from them at first place.
Google don't care about you. If you disappear they are more happy with
that. However detectability is not only about bypassing flags. I want
solve this problem for security reasons because detection in some
cases is really dangerous. I discussed about it already

In many different cases TBB users have to be undetectable (bypassing
flags, escaping from deep investigations, confusing malicious iframes
etc etc) when traffic flows through custom Tor exite nodes or even
when traffic flows directly just for the privacy TBB offers at client
side compared to plain Firefox.
TBB have a distinguishable User-Agent and screen size that can be
easily changed to something more common but it also have other
fingerprints that are hard to change, such as timezone=0 or
navigator.plugins=none or some dialogs [1] [2]. And TBB have even more
fingerprints that we are not aware of yet
Can someone please teach Tor users how to modify the source code and
compile a custom build or create browser Add-ons that subvert these
detection methods? There must be an option for those who urgently
(...) need undetectability and it doesn't require much effort to make
that happen.

Anonymity for Tor devs is a priority and they don't like give
different browser fingerprints to their users  because that plan makes
Tor users in each web service more unique as very few people actually
use Tor at each website, however uniqueness of user won't deanonymize
it right away, it depends on using same unique fingerprint on another
webservice that will confess user's identity and let attacker link the
pseudonymous identity to a real identity that used same browser
An optional tool that allows users temporarily make their TBB
undetectable whenever they need doesn't hurt anonymity of Tor network
at all.
I believe writing a browser Add-on that contains several common
profiles (desktop tablet and mobile configurations) or let users
manually define what their browser should return in response to data
requests, would be ridiculously easy.
And there is no need to wait for Tor developers to build such a
tool/guide, any third party can help.
No I don't talk about anonymity, I'm asking to fix detectability.
destination website shouldn't be able to detect user is using TBB,
some people think only problematic guys use TBB and Detecting it cause
a lots of problems in different scenarios (in my own case, for some
reasons i'm worry about QUANTUM_INSERT like programs that can
automatically attack me if they think i'm a suspicious user)
And there is no need to play flash/java in the game, lots of ordinary
people are uninstalling those malware-vectore plugins. Java is dead
and flash has to die, too.
