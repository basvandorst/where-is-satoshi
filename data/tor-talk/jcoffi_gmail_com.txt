If you're an exit node, I imagine someone was seeding a torrent through your relay.

Happy Holidays.
I've setup a server on tor that I connect to via "localhost..exit" instead of using a *.onion address. It works fine at first. However after 30 minutes or so I start receiving messages in my log from a connecting machine that says [notice] No Tor server exists that allows exit to 127.0.0.1:
The reason I used this method instead of hidden services was because my connections were timing out too frequently.
Any insight or constructive criticism would be appreciated.

So far the problem seems to exist only in tor-0.2.0.32-stable. The newer alpha version doesn't show signs of this problem so far. If it does, I'll do as suggested and let you know.

Line 834 in log.c has a typo. I caught it in .2.1.9-alpha and told myself that if I saw it in the next upgrade I'd say something. I just spotted it in 0.2.1.11-alpha.
