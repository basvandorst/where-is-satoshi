@_subject: [tor-talk] Orbit and transparent proxy rules 
I installed Orbit and went through the wizard and followed the
recommendations (i.e. to let it proxy everything since I don't know
what I'm doing).  I had it set to start on boot, but I turned that off
because it doesn't seem to work.  In essence, I get a warning stating:
WARNING: error starting trasparent proxy
and although I have a green icon telling me that I'm connected to the
Tor network, the check page tells me I'm not using Tor (which means
that other assertion is a lie :)
How can I debug and solve this?  There are some sites I'd prefer to
use with Tor when I'm mobile.  I'm not really worried about the other
applications (although keeping Google's hands of my location might be
somewhat of a plus).

What phone do you have?  Try installing the iptables app - orbot would not
work for me on cdma until I did that.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Advices for a Newbie 
With all due respect, I run linux on all my machines.  I have set up
and administer a LAMP server.  I have picked up a lot of security
knowledge.  I don't think of myself as below average intelligence.
I still understand almost nothing about tor - other than the general
concept about routing the packets through "anonymous" routes rather
than the shortest published route.
I have no idea what Tails does or is either.
Like the OP, I would love a Tor-for-dummies paper/e-book/guide.

For some reason, I still get "Error starting transproxy", and then the
check fails.

is much greater than would be a normal speed under tor, so I think
downloads does not obey proxy settings.

If they are going to answer your mail with a proforma reply, just resend
it.  Recorded delivery is a good idea too.
And contact your local Piratpartei.

my fone and it says powered by the tor project but when i look at the
settings it says sorry you are not using tor and i have downloaded
everything except i cannot get firefox or the tor browser so i am not realy
using any of the above i think ?
Does it also say something about proxy errors?  If your phone rooted?  If
your phone is not rooted and you are not connecting to tor then you don't
have the right iptables binary.  This means you'll need to root your phone
and get the iptables binary from the play store.

use orbot without the fone being rooted so i think thats why i cannot get
firefox or ttb but can i root my fone without a computer ?
That's beyond the scope of this list.  Google "how-to root android
In general you can use orbot without being root - but this assumes you have
the right iptables binary.  If you don't, and that would appear to be the
case you'll need to root it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Large search providers banning Tor exists, 
If you search the list archives you will find a substantial report on the
issues Google faces, how it tries to mitigate it without affecting tor, and
why tor is sometimes affected.  The answer is comprehensive, authentic and
reminds you what a small portion of web traffic tor actually is..
