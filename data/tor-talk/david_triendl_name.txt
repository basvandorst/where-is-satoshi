@_subject: Tor crashes? 
I am using TOR 0.1.1.21 on a Viruozzo based VPS with Debian installed. I tried the .debs from mirror.noreply.org and compiling it myself, but the result is the same: Tor crashes like a clock that strikes the quarters. Not later than 20 seconds after a clock quarter (means at HH:00, HH:15, HH:30, HH:45) Tor crashes without an error message.
The debug.log ends with these lines:
10: starting, inbuf_datalen 512 (0 pending in tls object).
10: starting, inbuf_datalen 0 (0 pending in tls object).
Does anybody experience the same?

@_subject: Excluding domains 
You can directly tell SeaMonkey to exclude a list of domains. Just open the settings window and navigate to "Advanced" => "Proxies". Then add your domain list to the "No Proxy for" field.

This works as well. If you want that all German and Austrian sites don't get routed via Tor set the ""No Proxy for" field  to ".at, .de" and it will not use the proxy for *.at and *.de domains.

@_subject: Tor Exit Node Sponsorship - looking for partners 
Hi everyone,
Kickstarter has three disadvantages:
1) It does not allow recurring fees, you'd have to start a new project
for every payment you want to make. This also means that someone who
funds the first Kickstarter project will not necessarily have to fund
the second one.
2) The creator and benificiary of the project has to be in the USA and
have a bank account there.
3) You can only pledge if you have an Amazon Payments account, for
which you need a credit card. Not everyone has (or wants) one. As much
as I hate to say this, PayPal might be a better alternative here. (Or
simple bank transactions for euroland people).
I quite like the idea of having another big node. While 20 small
non-exit VPS with only a few 100 kilobyte throughput are nice, one big
machine with 150 MBit/s thoughput (~ 100 TB a month) that has an open
exit policy and good abuse handling is nicer. Offering some backup
space and VPN (maybe from a second IP reserved for VPN use) is a nice
incentive too, btw.
