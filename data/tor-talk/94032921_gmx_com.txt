@_subject: [tor-talk] Connecting to SQL through TOR 
I have connected to many services including RDP, Web, FTP through TOR. For RDP I use a Proxifer that sends all connections from mstsc.exe though TOR. Right now I am having an issue connecting to SQL using the same method. Any ideas?
When I try to connect to SQL its saying proxy server cannot connect to host.
My Torrc files has these entries:
HiddenServiceDir C:\HSTest\SQL
HiddenServicePort 6001 127.0.0.1:1433
Opening up a SQL connection through excel I get this error. I tried with multiple SQL tools, all get the same error. I CAN connect when I use the IP Address.
[03.01 13:34:02] EXCEL.EXE (9376) *64 - o4nel857ejnetkzw.onion:6001 error : Could not connect through proxy 127.0.0.1:9150 - Proxy server cannot establish a connection with the target - TTL expired.
This shows a successful RDP connection:

@_subject: [tor-talk] Restricting TOR ports 
I checked off "This computer goes through a firewall that only allows connections to certain ports" and the allowed ports are 80,443.
1. From a netstat it looks like there is still some connections going to 9001 and imaps (143). Why is that?
2. Will this change also effect hidden services? I would rather run a service over port 443 for more transparancy with my ISP.
3. If I configure a bridge or obfsproxy bridge, will a hidden service connect though the bridge?
