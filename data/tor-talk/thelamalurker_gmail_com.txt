longer term availability.
It could be that only running a Relay for the 2 hours you are browsing
the web and then cutting off all the connections that have been made
through your Relay when you powerdown your desktop Windows PC and go to
bed might not be desirable.
I think it is rare for a desktop Windows machine to stay running 24/7.
So don't feel too bad about it.
I completely agree. By running Tor as a system daemon you can run it
under its own User (such as debian-tor) and then set up firewall rules
to block all outbound traffic except that coming from the Tor user.
This is how Tails prevents unintentional leaks that would have bypassed
Tor and potentially revealed your real IP address.
This is not possible when your unprivileged user starts Tor Browser and
then some weird Firefox plugin automatically launches Tor.
A download for just the Tor Browser without all the other crap mixed in
would be nice but it's not a big deal. Having sane defaults for
unsophisticated users is more important.

Are you aware that the FreeBSD project indiscriminately block all Tor users
from their official forums? Not even read access.
This is a problem because the forums are a vital source of help and
solutions to problems.
Why do you block even read access if not to send a very aggressive message
*against* Tor users?

It has always been blocked everytime I have tried over the years.
Dude started a thread specifically to shill FreeBSD to Tor users. At the
very least it seems appropriate to point out that the FreeBSD project
doesn't seem to particularly like Tor.
More optimistically I was hoping that if the original poster is actually
involved with FreeBSD he might be shamed into talking to the folks
responsible and attempt to get it fixed.
For what it's worth I did really like this talk from BSDCan 2016 about
improving on the Tor+Linux monoculture.

This is not for me it's for you. You want Tor users to use FreeBSD, this
is my feedback.
Blanket banning all Tor exits from accessing your *official* support
forum might piss off Tor users who took your advice to install FreeBSD
and now have difficulty getting help.
What you do with this feedback is up to you.
