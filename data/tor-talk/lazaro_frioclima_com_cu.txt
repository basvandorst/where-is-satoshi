@_subject: [tor-talk] Problems with cntlm 
I'm trying to configure Tor behind a local cntlm proxy that is behind a  Microsoft ISA Server 2006 but I can't connect to the Tor network. I'm not  sure if the problem is with cntlm or ISA or I'm doing something wrong. I  can connect all my other applications with the outside through cntlm.
Thanks in advance.
Best regards,
