@_subject: [tor-talk] visa.com blocked 
It appears to me that visa.com is blocking access to its site by users
using TOR.  I was unable to access the site using TOR, but when I went to
the site from a browser, Epiphany, outside of TOR, access was

@_subject: [tor-talk] Firefox, Adobe, and DRM 
I just received a message from the Free Software Foundation
advising me that Mozilla has climbed in bed with Adobe
Corporation and will implement digital rights management,
DRM, in FireFox.  Until now they had not supported DRM. They claim to take this act to preserve market share, but it
would not surprise me if money changed hands as an
additional encouragement.
TOR is not about DRM, but if TOR continues to use FireFox as
the basis for its browser, then the nose of the DRM camel
will appear under the wall of the tent.  Some of us have
assiduously avoided DRM, and TOR was one way to do so.  Will
it continue to be?
The source code for FireFox is available free and so the DRM
code could be striped out before making it the TOR browser.
doing so, however, will require additional effort; is TOR
prepared to take on this task? Paul A. Crable.  Portland, Oregon.  U.S.A.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Use of TOR for illegal activities 
I have just finished Macdonald's "Future Crime", a recent book listing the
ways in which we are all abused and insulted, and will be further abused
and insulted, by unsavory persons and organizations through our
technology, particularly through the Internet.  It makes sobering reading.
TOR is mentioned frequently, but the references are primary to its use by
criminals to carry out illegal activity, such as the Silk Road incident.
This ties in somewhat to a recent posting on this list claiming that 2/3's
of the activity on TOR is involved in pornography.
I suppose I sound like a disapproving fussbudget, but I have trouble
understanding how and why we allow TOR to be used this way.  I'm all for
free speech, but it's still illegal to falsely yell "Fire!" in a crowded
Is there some way to keep TOR out of the hands of sleazebags and crooks?

First, the author of "Future Crime" is Marc Goodman, not MacDonald as I
erroneously reported.
Second, thanks for the thoughtful replies.  Your points about avoiding
censorship are well taken.  I really can't think of any way to separate
the wheat from the chaff without some form of censorship.  I'd support
censorship if I was in charge of it, but I doubt most others would go
along with my idea.  So I guess we must leave things as they are, flawed
as they may be.
I believe that the founding fathers inserted freedom of speech in the
Amendments to allow people to speak their mind on political issues without
fear of retribution.  I think they'd be surprised at the purposes to which
it is being used today.
