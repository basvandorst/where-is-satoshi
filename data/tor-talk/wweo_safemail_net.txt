It's not pretending that it's difficult to do.  It is, in fact, difficult to do just by the nature of how Tor functions.  Even if you were logging everything that came out of an exit node that you control, you wouldn't be able to get good stats from that.  You'd need a significant sampling of other Tor exit nodes to do the same thing.  It's a bit hard to accept that you don't have an agenda to protect when you come in here asserting one of the most demonizing talking points against Tor with nothing hard to back up your claims other than "some guy on reddit said so."

No.  It shows that I'm simply not willing to accept an incredibly limited environment to speak for a network as a whole.
I've contributed by calling your bluff when you started getting antagonistic to others.  You don't have a good scientific experiment that helped you reach your conclusion.

While I hate to be the cynic, perhaps it's time to get an attorney involved.

I'm not surprised. Last week, the same guy kept asserting that Tor was mainly used for nefarious purposes like buying drugs or illegal pornography, in addition to claiming such would be "not difficult to prove." LOL!

You are projecting.
There is nothing wrong with using the legal process to protect your IP especially when someone who is misusing it is not willing to comply with simple requests and demands.
