@_subject: Limiting hops 
I use Tor on my laptop to encrypt wireless packets when connecting to an
unsecured wireless network.  Is there a way to limit the number of hops the
packets take through the servers so that I can better the speed?  I only
need one hop.  I'm running Windows XP.

Thanks everyone for the replies.  It's now apparent to me that Tor isn't
designed for the purpose I'm using it for and I would be better served with
a different solution. Is a VPN what I should be looking for?  I'm looking
for a no or low cost solution.  If this discussion should be carried out off
of this list, feel free to contact me directly.

I think we can safely say that for most people using Tor makes it
*more* likely that their unencrypted traffic will be sniffed.
But TOR would usually change who is sniffing the traffic:  Some guy in
his basement, some foreign government, or some spammer/scammer
harvesting email addresses and credit card numbers from your traffic
may be preferable to the person's school, employer, or government all
of which may have a more direct and specific interest in the person's
