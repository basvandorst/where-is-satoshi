Saito-san, All,
I'm living now in Japan. The new law, to me, is still confusing.
I had a Tor relay (non-exit) setup which I temporarily disabled partly for
fear that ISPs and law enforcement doesn't know much about Tor. And that
would lead them to my door.
I'm running the Tor relay purely to support the project nothing more.

Thanks for information Andrew. That is good to know.
