Can someone tell me how I can setup a Magnet application in the TOR Browser.
I need to able to "download" torrent files by the magnet application.
This is not available in the TOR browser.

I'm not using my Bittorrent over TOR.
I'm using TOR to connect to thepiratebay.se website as here in Holland that website is blocked by my provider (Ziggo).
Then I download the torrent files into my bittorrent program which is configured to use the internet in the normal way.
The piratebay changed their website, so you cannot download the torrents anymore but only can copy them using the magnet application.
