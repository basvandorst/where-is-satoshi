Don't confuse the Software Engineering Institute (CERT-CC is part of SEI) with academia, even if it is managed by Carnegie Mellon University.
SEI is a FFRDC (Federally Funded Research and Development Corporation) serving the US Department of Defense (and other partners) with a focus "specifically on software-related security and engineering issues". [  Its Pittsburgh building is off the CMU campus, located next to RAND corporation (another FFRDC with national security ties).  Wikipedia locates other SEI offices in Arlington, VA and Frankfurt, Germany.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Server / Browser html PGP Encryption 
What are you trying to accomplish?
First note that hidden servers already use RSA, the public key algorithm at the heart of OpenPGP.  The jumble of characters in the hidden service name is actually the fingerprint (or equivalent) of the service's public key.  The service sends you its full public key and your Tor client verifies its fingerprint, allowing you to authenticate the server's identity and send it messages that imposters are unable to intercept.  The extra features of OpenPGP (the protocol behind PGP, GPG, etc) don't add value here, at least not that I can see.
All of this is on top of the strong encryption of the Tor circuit which connects you to the server.
Going in the other direction, why do you want to provide an OpenPGP key to the server?  If it is for authentication,
Conversely, providing an OpenPGP across multiple session serves to identify you to the server(s) involved.  If this is what you want and you are using TLS (e.g. https), then a client certificate might be the right approach since it is already built into TLS.  I say might, because I haven't used client certs myself and don't know whether TorBrowser can be easily configured to use them.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Project Corporate Document FOI Request 
I have served on the board of directors of a nonprofit, though I have no affiliation with the The Tor Project, Inc.
Some of your requested documents are puzzlingly vague.  For example, I can only guess why you might want by "various Licenses and Certificates held", and would be at a loss to catalog the "form blanks to be signed by new parties of all types" used by my organization.
Others  are a matter of public record:  Consult the Massachusetts Secretary of State's web site [ for details related to
"Articles Of Incorporation", "Charter", "Bylaws", and "Operating Agreement".  Except for Bylaws, these named documents do not exist.  You will find their Articles of Organization and Annual Reports, which contain relevant information.
Others are on the Tor Web site itself:  The personnel you want to know about ("List of Officeholders", "Executives", "Voting Members", and "Shareholders") appear to be listed on the Tor Project Web site [  Of course, there are no shareholders, and precisely which people have voting power will be detailed in the Articles of Organization or Bylaws.
Still others appear not yet available.  It looks like you'll need some patience in obtaining the audited 2015 financials.
Finally, "Meeting Minutes covering years 2010 ~ 2015" should be available.  I would contact the Tor Project directly (Executive Director's office, maybe).
Tortalk doesn't seem like the right forum for your request.  The issue you filed in the tracking system was given medium priority, which seems proper to me.  Given the lack of specificity and redundancy or your request, I would expect it to take some time to complete.

In practice, the OpenPGP format used by GPG is unsatisfactory for automatic software updates.  GPG does not provide a library for creating or reading this format, so you'd have to run the signature checking in a child process, along with gpg-agent, intrusive keyring management, and quirky behavior across operating systems.  More trouble than it is worth!
MAR is a refreshingly simple format which uses PKCS1 (RSA-2048 + SHA2 should be in use now) for signatures - the same cryptographic primitives you are likely to use with GPG, but without the OpenPGP format insanity.
Personally, I believe bugs in the Firefox side of TBB are far more likely to provide exploits than a signed MAR update process, but whatever floats your boat.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to make the Tor service to stop faster? 
I bet shutdown delay has to have something to do with TCP connection finalization semantics, which can leave client processes stuck in a FIN_WAIT_2 state if tor closes too quickly.  My memory is a little vague here, but it is a result of interrupting the FIN-> ACK<- FIN<- ACK-> dialogue ... the client won't close the connection until it receive's that last ACK form tor, which tor can't send if it closes before it gets the client's FIN.
I've seen this with server processes on my computer that route through tor.  Killing tor can leave them in that FIN_WAIT_2 state in which they cannot be killed, and the service cannot be restarted since the hung process has the service port allocated.  Then it's up to the TCP stack to close the connection after it times out.
So, yes - it is a nicer way to say goodbye to clients.  And nicer here can mean nicer to you as well.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Kernel OOPS through Tor - report or ignore? 
Check for other causes before reporting:  Is the software (OS kernel & extensions in this case) up to date?  Is there a hardware error?  I reported a Tor crash, only to find it was caused by a failing disk.
Creo, It sounds like you have a crash recovery utility running.  If so, save the crash dump and reboot.  You can send the dump in or wait to see if it happens a second time.

The problem here is that there was no read syscall, so no errno value to check.  The file (microdesc cache) was mapped into memory using tor_mmap_file.  The disk error occurred when the kernel attempted to page in the data on a memory read, and signal 10 (bus error) was properly raised.  Handling this situation correctly is tricky.  I do not fault the Tor programmers for letting it fall through to the crash handler.
Here's my stack trace in case you are interested.

Descriptions of what the links are about would be appreciated.  Otherwise this kind of post looks awfully spammy to my eye.
But since we are on the topic, I am curious whether packet delivery shuffling will be added to Tor, and also what other notable security features distinguish these networks from Tor.
