It's bogus. Ebay and Paypal both will *NEVER* include a link in an email.
Both will tell you to go to the site and log in to your account. ANY email
that tells you to do anything else is bogus. Always type ebay and paypal
urls yourself or use bookmarks you created yourself, *NEVER* use a link from
an email.

- From what I've read, i2p reminds me somewhat of freenet, only without the
cached data store.  To me, freenet looks like the better option for
anonymous content publishing / retrieval other than Tor.

Hash: SHA256
I've been having the worst time trying to get the Portable Apps version
of Firefox to successfully connect via Tor.
Setting IE to use 127.0.0.1:8118 for all but local connections works and
checking IP address at showmyip.com and similar confirms it.
Using Torbutton with a regular, Non-Portable Firefox 2 also works.
In the portable Firefox 3.0.6, using the "test settings" button on the
Torbutton preferences dialog always yields the result:
"Tor proxy test FAILED! Check your proxy and Privoxy settings.
Privoxy config file contains the line
forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .
And works properly with IE6 and non-portable Firefox 2
Using Torbutton 1.2.0
firefox 3.0.6 (Portable Apps Version)
Tor v0.2.0.34 (r18423) ... the current "Vidalia Bundle" package.
Windows XP Service Pack 2
Thanks for any help.

I assume that Tor can (or could be made to) detect what OS it's being
run on.  Given that, what if Tor were to check it's current version
against the directory servers while it's creating circuits.
Then if the version running is judged too far out of date to be safe, it
could download the most recent version (via the Tor network of course)
for the OS it's running on and "auto-update" itself.
Yes, this might be considered a bit invasive but would result in the
node in question being up to date while causing only a momentary break
in connectivity.  There could also be an option in torrc to disable this
auto-update (which would be enabled by default) if desired.
That way if somebody decides to use Tor the way this collection of tbreg
nodes has, at least it can stay secure without user who don't know
anything about Tor and needed updates.

How about simply take a page from Freenet?  Each new build of Freenet
comes with a "lastGoodVersion=" variable that contains the version
number of the oldest build it's willing to talk to.
Nodes older than that can't connect to the network for anything except
updating the out of date node.

Not too easy to miss in the case of Sygate which puts up a large
'always on top' box asking if the change is ok.
I did have Privoxy running.  After shutting it down progress went from
stuck at 5% to stuck at 80%
Even though I had set the firewall to allow TOR, it was being blocked.
 After I created an explicit rule for TOR allowing it to connect to
any port, it started working.
Thanks for the clues
