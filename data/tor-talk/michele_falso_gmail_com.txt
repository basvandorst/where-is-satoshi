hi, i' am a student of information science at University of Salerno, Italy.
As i'm writing about tor for an exam i have read tor's document design but,
i don't understand how tor network generates the key to cipher circuits, who
generates this keys (identity key, onion key public/private pair and link
i'd like understand, step by step, negotiation of TLS link between OR/OR -
OR/OP and, after this, how tor generates public/private onion keys for each
Thanks very much for answers.
