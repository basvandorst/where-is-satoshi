@_subject: [tor-talk] What is "cookie protections"? 
Dear list,
I'm experimenting with moving all my daily web browsing to the Tor
Browser Bundle on Linux. For this use case, I've disabled the "Don't
record browsing history or website data" check box in the Privacy and
Security Settings dialog. (The reason is that I wanted to have the
option to stay logged in on a few key websites.)
There's only one potential danger I see here - cookies. (Of course
there's also the danger of someone stealing my browsing history from my
hard drive, but this is not in my threat model for now.)
This is why I'd like to understand what is the "Cookie protections"
dialog about. It's not clear to me what these "protections" do and how
they are meant to be used. I suspect it may be something like a cookie
white list, allowing one to mark certain cookies as protected and purge
all the other cookies (exactly what I'd need for my use case), but I may
be wrong.
I couldn't find any info on it. Can someone clarify?
P.S. I also have some other questions about tweaks to TBB for the "main
browser" use case, I'll ask them later to keep things clean.

Thank you for your suggestion. That's a great Firefox addon
definitely. I used to use it on Firefox. More recently on FF I used
Cookie Monster.
But I'd like to minimize the use of addons on TBB whenever possible.
And it seems to me that the "Cookie Protections" dialog that's built
into TBB can be useful. I'd just like to better understand what is its
intended purpose. (And maybe document it on the wiki.)

Thanks for all the info. Yeah, I browse with third party cookies
disabled. Additionally, I use two windows of TBB - one for the few sites
where I stay logged in, and the other, in Private Browsing mode, for
everything else.
Regarding the "cookie protections" menu item, it only shows up in the
Tor button's menu if the "Don't record history" checkbox is unchecked in
Privacy and Security settings.

Firefox's own Cookie Dialog) are always empty in the default TBB
configuration, *unless the user selects to enable history*" (emphasis mine.)
I.e. it's only broken if one is using the Private Browsing mode - and in
this case it is properly hidden. If I do record history however, the
cookie protections dialog is not empty.
But anyway I'd like to know what is the intended purpose of it (I think
I have already deduced it, but I'd like to hear other people's theories
about it).

I'd add that this applies not only to TBB, but to onion services too. I
run a personal onion site with my real-world identity stated right on
the front page. And I have no problem with that.
