If anyone has good intel on some really secure DNS addresses that would be great currently I'm using my VPN provider DNS servers and would like to have some more numbers to add to my list.
Primary DNS: 146.185.134.104 (Netherlands)
Secondary DNS: 192.241.172.159 (U.S. New York)

I'd seen this earlier on the tor talk lists ( and realized that this could just as easily be done on a raspberry pi with some creative reprogramming for a hundred bucks less.

Okay first of all Tor is not a VPN or an ISP and two don't even think about downloading torrents over the Tor network because you'll destroy it if you do. If your looking into downloading anonymously without getting caught their are several options to consider (which I'll list I2P is another anonymous network to consider using for downloading Bittorrent Over I2P - I recommend using a combination of VPN or two VPN's and a seedbox
there's also DD-WRT, OpenWRT routers as well:
