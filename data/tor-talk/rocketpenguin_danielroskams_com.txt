Hash: SHA1
I have experienced this problem many, many times. Seems that I am not
the only one! I agree that we need to do something about it.
(complaining/persuading to Cloudflare etc.) and without JS all the
captchas are buggy and useless.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor relay on home computer 
Hash: SHA1
I want to support Tor and I want to run a relay on my home computer.
Is it fine to do that because the IP address keeps changing every 1-2
weeks. I know how to edit the config and everything else.
Sorry if I posted on the wrong place.
