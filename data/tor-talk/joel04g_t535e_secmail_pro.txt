@_subject: [tor-talk] Idea for a stand-alone browser based on Tor browser 
Tor browser has good defense against many tracking techniques, however,
internet users may want a way to browse the web without anonymity but with
some of the great features Tor browser provides. (Security Level,
Noscript, Isolate trackers, Anti Fingerprinting, etc)
Some reasons users may want a browser like this include:
~Accessing websites that don't like Tor users
~Streaming without latency
~Doing online banking (Tor could create suspicion of a possible hack
attempt and block or hassle users)
~An easy and hassle free browser for users who really don't like latency
or with bad internet
I believe a stand-alone browser with onion routing removed but based on
the same code Tor browser uses could be useful to many internet users. I'd
love to hear everyone's thoughts on this!
