@_subject: [tor-talk] A question about Tor & Hidden Services 
Hello all,
I am wondering if it is possible to pass the hostname & private key on a
hidden service directly to the control socket, without writing it to the
hard drive (and without passing it to the process as a startup argument).

Can't you just use a load balancing proxy instead?

There are better mailing lists for this discussion.
