@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor's reputation problem with pedo, 
Tor has a rather severe reputation problem at the moment.  Given the recent
revelations around malware on the network, and the pervasiveness of
pedophilia, I think we should consider a course of action to help boost the
network's PR.
For one - while nobody is interested in acting as the police and stamping
out the pedo material, cleaning up links to pedo sites on the hidden wiki
and the various other link dirs would be a good start.
As a newcomer to Tor, as I explored the various onions out there, I felt as
if practically everywhere I turned there were links taking me to pedo
sites, IRC channels etc.
I recognize that free speech means free speech for everyone, even those
with views that we find objectionable, but there's nothing to stop the
community from turning a cold shoulder to these people who see informed
consent as being an optional or academic concept.
Just my $.02

Directly pursuant to this, and to my original note: What about a simpler
What about simply scouring all the directories, removing links to the pedo
Can you stamp them out? No, but can you make it VERY unlikely / difficult
to simply stumble upon them while investigating Tor-space? Yes you can!
And by doing so, you create an environment where people, taking advantage
of the incredibly awesome work folks have done with OnionBrowser, who
aren't necessarily Tor savvy can get a sense for what the system can do and
come away with a positive impression.

Can't agree with this.
You can get OnionBrowser for pretty much any platform.  Download and run,
end of story.  I grabbed it for my iPad and within a minute I was up and

Agreed, but understand - I'm not suggesting that *the Tor project* itself
cull this content, merely that directory / wiki operators make a concerted
effort to at least clearly label the pedo dens so they can be easily
avoided by those of us who have a real issue with them.

For what it's worth, OnionBrowser is open sourced, it is for Apple
My point was that using Tor need not be inconvenient at all.
I agree that there's a need for a hidden services directory, but I gather
from what I've read that doing this isn't easy due to large scale vandalism.
We'd need something like a Wikipedia with a dedicated group of volunteers
willing to undo each vandalistic act and keep links clearly labeled.

OK, you're right.  That's a bad idea - what about clearly labeling the pedo
sites as pedo sites?
And once again, please note I am in no way suggesting that *the Tor
project* undertake this effort, but that people who operate the hidden
directories might consider making it a little easier for new folks to avoid
this kind of content.
That's all.

I just had to shut my relay down because someone was using it to hijack
someone else's Gmail account :\
Dunno how I could get around this other than by blocking port 80, which is
kind of the point :)

To be clear, it was my choice.  Linode received an abuse complaint, so I
could either shut down the relay or have my account nuked.
I chose to shut down the relay.

I understood the legal implications.  See my above note about the abuse
report from Linode.
I'm not complaining, just noting that it's unfortunate that folks have to
abuse things.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor 0.2.4.17-rc is out 
I realize this is release candidate code, and the answer may well be "if
you need to ask this question you shouldn't be running it" but is there any
way to get the latest RC builds installed via the usual apt-get mechanisms
on my Ubuntu box without building from source?
I want to keep enjoying the niceties like /etc/init.d scripts and the like
and don't want to overwrite/corrupt the package managed binaries if I can
at all help it, but my linode is being hammered to death (non exit relay)
and I need to do something :)

It might be short sighted but I couldn't honestly blame them either.
When I ran an exit relay (not just a relay) the reason I had to take it
down is some idjit was using my exit node to hijack Gmail accounts.

Folks we just did an interview with Eric Schles of the Manhattan DA's
office who wrote a bunch of interesting software to help hunt down
human trafficking.
The reason I re-post it here is that it has a bunch of interesting
discussion around Tor - Eric would like to find a way, without
diminnishing the usefulness of the system and the service it provides,
to help root out and possibly ostricize pedo / sexual exploitation

@_subject: [tor-talk] Are webmail providers biased against Tor? 
They're 'biased' against Tor and other anonymizers for a very simple
reason - people abuse them.
In my brief career as a Tor exit relay operator, I had someone use my
exit to hijack Gmail accounts.
So, honestly, I can't blame them.  When something is *repeatedly*
identified to be a source of bad actors, it's incumbent upon those
providers to do something about it.
IMO Google's response - trying to balance a desire to enable genuine
users to use Tor while barring the bad actors, is commendable.
It's a tough problem folks, we should all recognize that.
Just my $.02.
