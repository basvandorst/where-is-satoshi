We're working on doing something similar at BrassHornCommunications.uk with
a 'Bridges on Demand' offering which'll spin up a new private bridge *(tick
box config for choosing meek plugins etc)* and provisions with Chef /
Will you be open sourcing any of your automation tools?
Will all your relays be within the same AS / DC or spread about?
Are you using OpenVZ / KVM et al / dedicated servers or 3rd party VPS
services e.g. Amazon for each relay?
No mention of what legal entity operates this website, the domain is
registered to an individual with obfuscated whois so I'd be skeptical of
just putting in a credit card number, more so that there is no indication
of who will process the transaction *(although looking through the source
it appears to be stripe.com )* and no option for paypal
No IPv6 makes me sad

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is there any societal use in Bitcoin? 
Ablative Hosting (clearnet + single hop onion hosting) is planning on utilising Bitcoin, not because we expect our customers to do anything criminal but because banks do and have exerted moralistic control over customers because of the nature of downstream customers / users (e.g. FetLife).
Visa / MasterCard etc shouldn't be able to dictate what ones customers publish on their websites, decentralised finance is useful at the very least from this perspective.
