@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and DNS 
hi all,
saw an open item in the tor projects, about dns and other resource record types.  this got me thinking about
just trying to understand Tor and DNS.
for what I gather so far, is Tor and dns is only about "a" records and quad records "aaaa", thats pretty much it.
i think PTR also but just whats need for hostname lookup.
I am assuming this means tor clients, and tor browsers but have yet to validate that.
any other info on this would be helpful.  still trying to dig around and find where the data may be.
