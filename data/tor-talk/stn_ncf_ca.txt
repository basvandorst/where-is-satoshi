@_subject: [tor-talk] Simulators available for Tor Network 
this is a good opportunity to ask since someone is asking about simulators and uwaterloo experimentor.
if one were to buy an old mac pro or build a nix box how much RAM is needed to run something like experimentor well enough to model the Tor network usefully ?
multiple cpu socket boards cost and so do stacks of RAM so old mac pros can sometimes be  cost effective.
anyone care to comment?

some weeks ago i asked daniel why he blocked tor traffic.  he sited SSH brute force, smtp and other abuse issues.  he's a sysadmin so i can understand the need to protect his networks.
thanks for brining in a higher resolution view here. hope your approach works or at least opens the door to communication with him.
he maintains a tor  list updated every 30 minutes so maybe addressing his specific concerns can help ?  i'd hate to see others blindly block from his lists.
he was polite and answered some basic networking questions about netBSD for me and that was about it.  he didn't answer me immediately either.  so straight to /dev/null ... not in my case at least.
he also doens't like anonymous proxies generally by the notice his site gives when attempting  to connect with tor if i've read it correctly.

i think roger dingledine presented some short timeline evidence awhile back in a video i saw but this is from memory.
a US university and the DoJ usa tallied tor traffic on their relay and only found something like 3% "unwanted" traffic.
that could have included things like copyrighted music sharing.
the study wasn't continued for some reason.
maybe someone who can correctly recall the event or study can fill in some blanks and verify but ...
only 3% "unwanted" traffic. that's easy to take IMO.

@_subject: [tor-talk] ACM ref to safe statistical analysis on tor/anonymity 
i found this ref regarding appropriate analysis on tor given the recent threads and interest.  might be dated with a 2010 pub date..
The Tor network is one of the largest deployed anonymity networks, consisting of 1500+ volunteer-run relays and probably hundreds of thousands of clients connecting every day. Its large user-base has made it attractive for researchers to analyze usage of a real deployed anonymity network. The recent growth of the network has also led to performance problems, as well as attempts by some governments to block access to the Tor network. Investigating these performance problems and learning about network blocking is best done by measuring usage data of the Tor network. However, analyzing a live anonymity system must be performed with great care, so that the users' privacy is not put at risk. In this paper we present a case study of measuring two different types of sensitive data in the Tor network: countries of connecting clients, and exiting traffic by port. Based on these examples we derive general guidelines for safely measuring potentially sensitive data, both in the Tor network and in other anonymity networks.

yes they have allot of good usage data tied to political and social change and censorship methods.
in other videos too i believe. if you have time keep obtaining the vidoes and watching if you can.  you'll learn allot.  don't be afraid of "hacker" conference videos on tor.   lots of good tor stuff by roger dingledine and some with both RD and jacob appelbuam.   those talks are a treasure trove even if they look dated at first glance.  i find allot of my questions taken care of in them regarding various decisions and "Why" tor does things the way they do.
very valuable because this is real world empirical knowledge as the Tor Project has had to adapt to changes and maintain their goals in spite of ill-informed attacks on the project.  no fluff.
anonymity is key of course so Tor will follow safe use guidelines when gathering statistics.
guidelines as per 2010 published in the article you liked.  glad it was helpful.

more social and political change data but with more examples than the previous video mentioned regarding the very real dangers involved trying to speak one's beliefs in an oppressive regime.  worse case death.
Published on Aug 30, 2013
Tor developers Roger Dingledine and Jacob Appelbaum talk about how exactly governments are doing the blocking, both in terms of what signatures they filter in Tor (and how Tor has gotten around the blocking in each case), and what technologies they use to deploy the filters -- including the use of Western technology to operate the surveillance and censorship infrastructure in Tunisia (Smartfilter), Syria (Bluecoat), and other countries. They cover what they've learned about the mindset of the censor operators (who in many cases don't want to block Tor because they use it), and how we can measure and track the wide-scale censorship in these countries. Last, they explain Tor's development plans to get ahead of the address harvesting and handshake DPI arms races.
(Iran blocked Tor handshakes using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) in January 2011 and September 2011. Bluecoat tested out a Tor handshake filter in Syria in June 2011. China has been harvesting and blocking IP addresses for both public Tor relays  and private Tor bridges for years.)

muskokas are a long standing toronto reachable pricey kind of cottage country. and yes residents of the muskokas would rightly be miffed at me for saying that.  hmmm they are all clad stainless cookware last a lifetime .. i digress
suprisingly it loads though i doubt you'd want to bother actually buying but it might make a silly media hook.   want safest online ordering possible ... use .ca  because it's currently tor friendly.
you asked for hope.  well ... not a monolith in practise ?  not much silver there but it's something.  but like the skype microsoft example ... microsoft doesn't necessarily see tor as a real threat but block tor from skype connections.
they hire some outfit to filter.  i guess the more they filter the better they can advertise they are doing their job?

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor browser speed. 
i've been informed running a bridge  relay/node requires 24/7 uptime so i'm building a "Box" to run at home dedicated to a tor bridge.
it takes more than a week for a node to start to integrate into the network and every time the node goes down i think you start again.
but you can run one via torcloud. i run two of them (
originally i opened a torcloud node to offer bandwidth to the torproject while i built my home torbox from old hardware but ...
torcloud is inexpensive (for 1 year at least) and likely more reliable than a home ISP connection  (at least more reliable than my connection in canada).
this way i can donate bandwidth both from home and via "the cloud".  if one goes down the other still runs.  additionally cloud + home offers network diversity.
i can't gurantee you will reach the speeds you desire however amazon's cloud services are designed to be steady and reliable.  again  better than my home ISP connection in terms of uptime.
torcloud is an official torproject release.
i quite like it.  the torproject has a preconfigured image you install after starting your amazon cloud computing account.     i am not an expert but have been through the process twice so can offer help if you run into problems.   i have yet to pay any fees after running for one month but torcloud cap is currently $3 USD/month under the amazon cloud computing "Free" plan (free up to 15GB networking bandwidth and torlcoud caps at 40GB usage/month).
once your torcloud bridge is running you can connect to it by manually entering your bridge node IP in place of a list of bridges tor gives you.

hi sectec,
i meant running both home bridge node and a torcloud node offers more divesity than i could offer normally as an individual.
if i could have setup tor on a different cloud service as inexpensively and easily i would have.    additionally i would have done so within my own country.
i don't have the skills to run a bridge from a different provider (yet.  i have to learn to compile at home first or  learn to install one of the precompiled vidalia packages on another cloud provider).  the amazon cloud was pre-packaged by torproject and it made it fairly easy all things considered.
i don't understand the choice criteria within the tor network well enough to know what the chances of a same net IP inner layer (bridge) handoff might be.   i assumed the more nodes the better for tor.
but i can't recall exiting in my own country yet.

this is "gold" to me.
what i mean is i can do some stats analysis for the torproject if the dataset exists and there is a question defined.    this churn question is a nice example.
the datasets are identified
instructions exist to parse the data (willing to try)
delimeters or data tags are given (r lines p lines)
question clearly stated.
_to give more people access to the data_
a wishlist might include a general tool for parsing data and perhaps exporting to common formats (csv libreoffice spreadsheet etc).
you might be surprised with the breadth and pool of people who can help once they can easily import a dataset into their stats, matlab or spreadsheet package they happen to know. decent psychology programmes require a good understanding of stastical analysis for example.  many psych students out there.  i've seen some social psych profs give matlab homework for example.  regarding social networks.
i guess if you know how social networking data can be amassed and interpreted you can figure out how to obfuscate that data too.  just a thought.  i'd still like to see tools that put out garbage that look like data useful to marketing and sales but i digress.    maybe everone looking average within 0.5 SD can work.  since cookies were invented.  _my skills are "menh"_ in the large scheme of things but i dont mind the work and i take it seriously.
multiple regression i can do fairly easily but multiple X and multiple Y ( eg factor analysis, principle components analysis, cluster, discriminant function analysis) would be a project that would take a good reference and study.  i am willing but skills are old.  i will try parsing some data on my own and see if i can "massage" the format to enter a stats package or two.  if a dataset can enter open/libre/neo office spreadsheet file i can export from there to what i need.  CSV tab  variant or perhaps a user defined  delimiter method.  i'll have to check.  my s/w is old but useful.
as i don't know tor well enough to come up with questions of my own questions that help the torproject learn about itself in the wild like this interest me allot if they are helpful to the projects' needs.

from a usability perspective issues i've run into with wget involve a disconenct between what the user wants to do and how it's presented as an option.
one has to go through a lengthy decoding project to get what one wants.
so a well thought out gui overlay can help accessibility allot.
this version of gui wget at least has a minimal pick list easily decoded

perfect for d/l datasets from torproject.

new talk subscriber. i'm
volunteering to help keep torcloud alive by offering help even though i can't be primary maintainer.
i recently got a torcloud  node up and running. $3 month first year is quite good. stable and once going no hassles.  i like the idea. less prone to outages than my home isp etc.
i did so because i have yet to build a good box for my home connection to service a torbridge for residential broadband
(suggestions as to what to use welcome.  pcbsd, debian or ubuntu flavour etc.  i'm using older h/w likely dual core 2.3ghz.  i think i have 4 gig ram but willing to invest in more.)
i can see the value keeping torcloud alive even if users stick with it for only a year of low cost donation.
no one knows me so i cannot handle sensitive procedures but i'm willing to help take other work off someone's hands that doesn't involve the required trust level.  eg update documentation and field help once i know process a bit better.
in a support message lunar mentioned torcloud needs a maintainer. perhaps having a helper might make it easier for someone to apply their name to it?
since tor requires consistent uptime i can see torcloud being an asset.  as much as i'll try to get a solid nix box going at home i suspect torcloud node might be more reliable vs people like me building boxes and running nix fulltime at home to service tor. (?)

since torcloud can limit usage accurately per user something like a "Bulk deal" with solid use control might go a long way to someone with the skills to negotiate with amazon.
that and an incredible archive of node level data.
in terms of torcloud use i suspect amazon's concern will be bandwidth use and 40GB/month is roughly the cap in ontario canada for "entry level" home broadband connections.  considered "light" in this market (most families have to buy more expensive packages and buy overage insurance or a larger cap here but that's another story.  it's really

i'm repeating myself a little but
i really think torcloud has potential to be very good for the tor network if costs can be managed.
i keep thinking about network reliability.  we had several outages this summer in the province of ontario.  bell canada's backbones affected smaller ISPs including mine.  while running a bridge at home is good i doubt it will be as reliable as my torcloud bridge judging by outages this summer.
this might continue sadly as canada cannot keep up with traffic requiring exchanges right now.  we route traffic to the US quite often even if the domains are .ca to .ca.  we're short on infrastructure.  makes little sense since IX hardware is relatively cheap.

i have created 2 account with the same credit card and both qualified as free accounts.  { !!!!! }
_thanks again Robert.  great tip !_
until i build a dedicated machine to house tor at home i decided to try torcloud.
it actually has some advantages over running tor at home.  one of them network consistency which greatly helps the tor network.
EG my ISPs backbone provider has had many outages over this summer and into the fall (bell canada toronto-montreal corridor)
quite bad.  it takes more than a week for a tor node to become fully integrated into the tor network so every outage creates another long delay to being useful to tor.
i am running 2 torcloud nodes now so i can take my time building the tor machine at home.
i will likely run both torcloud and a home tor box in the end.
