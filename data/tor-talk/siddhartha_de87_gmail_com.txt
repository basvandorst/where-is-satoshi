@_subject: [tor-talk] [tor-dev] Need to know if this is a bug 
" TransPort requires OS support for transparent proxies, such as BSDs' pf
or Linux's IPTables."
It's disabled because there's no Windows transparent proxy implementation
in Tor. That's likely because Windows has no OS support for transparent
Are there any thoughts of including this feature using something like
WinPCAP or SharpPCAP which allow packet capture and modification ( eg
source address modification etc ) ?
Thanking you ,

Dear all ,
I just found out that the tor.exe included in the Tor Browser ( ver 5.5 )
for Windows bundle ( Tor ver 0.2.7.6 ) does not support TransPort and
TransListenAddress ... The error message given was :-
Jan 29 23:16:24.129 [warn] Failed to parse/validate config: TransPort and
TransListenAddress are disabled in this build.
Jan 29 23:16:24.129 [err] Reading config failed--see warnings above.
Is this a deliberate design consideration or a bug ...
If we keep the tor.exe of both the browser bundle and expert bundles synced
I think it would be easier for users who would like to use Tor both as a
browser as well as a Transparent Proxy .
Thanking you ,
Yours sincerely ,
Siddhartha De
