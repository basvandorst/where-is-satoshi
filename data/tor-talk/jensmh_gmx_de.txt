@_subject: P2P wanted? 
I think we should encourage use of p2p over the tor network because
- p2p users may want anonymity too
- more traffic can lead to more anonymity

@_subject: tor 0.1.0.17, router_mark_as_down(): We just marked ourself as down. Are your external addresses reachable? 
After upgrading from 0.1.0.16 to 0.1.0.17, i get the following warning/error message:
Tor: router_mark_as_down(): We just marked ourself as down. Are your external addresses reachable?
There is no packet filter running and tor seems to accepting incoming connnections.
Is this a tor bug?
