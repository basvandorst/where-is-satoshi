to the local port corresponding to the exit policy...
Please note that the following Registry entries may be changed
for a better operation of Tor with Windows XP as far as I know:
MaxUserPort  set the value to 10000 (this increase the number of local ports used :
default is 5000 : here is 10000. Put the same values in your FW rules...
So instead of 1024 to 5000 set to 1024 to 10000
set the value to 30 (Means 30 seconds.this increase the speed of Fin_Wait
state of finished connection. The default value is about 4 minutes !!!)
If your FW is not a rule set FW: good luck...  ;-)
Hope this help.
Let us know.

and was later arrested and questioned on allegations of further criminal
activity at The News of the World, specifically the News International
phone hacking scandal. As a result of the subsequent trial, Coulson was
sentenced to 18 months in jail.
The MI5 and FBI are investigating a "network of corrupt officials" as
part of their inquiries into phone hacking, police corruption, and
bribery. It is only a matter of time before MI5 and FBI agents bring
down Rupert Murdoch and Prime Minister David Cameron together on
corruption charges. This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to
