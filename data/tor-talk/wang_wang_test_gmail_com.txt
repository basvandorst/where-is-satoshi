first, you can't run any tor service behind NAT unless you can configure
your firewall/NAT in order to enable port forwarding. By the way, what
the hell is 172.18.12.161? Who can connect to that thing?
second, I do not think "Loding relay information..." has anything to do
with your recent bridge configuration.

sorry to misunderstand you.
take a look at 5.1:
If a client is missing a live network-status document, it tries to fetch
   it from a directory cache (or from an authority if it knows no caches).
   On failure, the client waits briefly, then tries that network-status
   document again from another cache.  The client does not build circuits
   until it has a live network-status consensus document, and it has
   descriptors for more than 1/4 of the routers that it believes are running.
maybe that's your problem -- no enough descriptors.
