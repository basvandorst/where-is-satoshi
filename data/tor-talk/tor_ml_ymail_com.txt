@_subject: When is the 'MyFamily' setting unnecessary? 
I'm curious in which cases tor would _never_ use certain nodes to create one circuit and therefore makes the 'MyFamily' setting unnecessary.
I heard only of one "rule" (I guess on this list but I'm not sure):
- tor would not use nodes within the same /16 network to create a circuit
are there more such rules?

If it is technically not necessary, because tor would never use certain nodes in one circuit. I would understand people running >20 nodes that do not use 'MyFamily'.
If there are certain rules I would stop asking people to set MyFamily if one of these rules apply in the concrete scenario.
So there are no rules beside the "/16 network" - rule?

@_subject: connect Vidalia to a running tor instance 
is it possible to connect/"attach" Vidalia to a tor process that gets started by an init script and is running as user A, while Vidalia is running as user B?

That is what I did
..and tor is listening on 9051 but I don't now how to tell Vidalia that it should connect after feeding the passwort in the Vidalia Advanced Settings Tab.
Then I thought the settings in that tab (advanced) are used to configure tor not to connect to tor.

It is irritating but one has to tick:
"Start the Tor software when Vidalia starts"
even if Vidalia just connects to a already running tor instance and doesn't start tor.

This is not about me. I sometimes ask tor node admins that run many nodes to set MyFamily. Then I get a reply "it is not necessary".
If I knew that it is not necessary I wouldn't contact them in the first 1f94aaf1774d6d9e4c4b7bd242c3dc592c49db00 Pandora19

I believe Jake, when he says that these nodes would never be used in the same circuit, but I would like to know why - just to avoid asking the next tor node admin in a similar case.
Yes I mean the behaviour of the official tor software.

I can confirm that vidalia does not connect to tor (via controlport) if
"Start the Tor software when Vidalia starts"
is not activated and I do not click the "Start Tor" button manually.
Simply providing the password does not result in a connection to the controlport. (vidalia v0.2.9)
