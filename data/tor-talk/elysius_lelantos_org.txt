@_subject: [tor-talk] Can Google location system track TOR users? 
The other WiFi networks in range of your Wifi gave Google location
information. Google has built an extensive database of Wifi SSID's etc
via their google maps cars.
It has nothing to do with Tor.

In addition, you will need to check for DNS leaks, since the e-mail
client will do a MX host lookup for each recipient's e-mail domain.

Yes, if using webmail via Tor (and the Tor Browser) is one of the safest
ways to use e-mail while remaining anonymous.
Another way would be to setup Icedove or Thunderbird using Torbirdy (to
access clearnet e-mail services) and Foxyproxy (to access both clearnet
and darknet addresses). So long as your e-mail client and proxy are
properly setup, you should be able to reliably keep your private IP
address safe.
The main concern would be firing up your regular browser by mistake and
logging in (even once) using your real IP address.
Our service, Lelantos, only provides e-mail via Tor. We developed it
just so that 1% human-error chance is removed - you must access it via
Tor to login or register. (No javascript needed)

Hi Missouri,
We accept Bitcoin for payment. No personal information is needed to open
an e-mail account with us.
Bitcoins can be purchased by any means, and then sent to a service like
Bitcoin Fog if you need to make your bitcoins truly anonymous.

The more I read about various exit node exploits, the more convinced I
am that Tor's future is in beefing up hidden service functions and
keeping as much traffic as possible within the Tor network.
I hope that the Tor developers see this the same way. Expanding the
usefulness of hidden services is the way for Tor to grow and be accepted.
