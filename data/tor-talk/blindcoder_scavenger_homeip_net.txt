Hello List.
I finished the first version of a Tor LiveCD on Linux basis a few days ago.
It comes in a size fitting on a visitcard sized CD-R:
Documentation is here:
BitTorrent Iso Images are seeded at 200kb/sec and available at:
I am aware of Robert Hogans LiveCD and already in touch with him about ways
in which we can profit from each others work.

Hi people.
In response to a law that passed the german legislative today, I will cease
production, development and distribution of ROCKate binaries and - maybe -
even source code soon.
The reasen is ?202c StGB which states (IANAL translation):
"Producing, acquiring, selling, giving, distributing or making-accessible of
passwords or other access codes as well as computer programs whose aim it is
to commi a crime ... will be punished with up to one year in jail or a fine."
See also: Basically, these waters are too hot for me to tread in. Though the official
reading of the wall - reading from politicians that is - says that they only
target 'criminals' and there is no need to worry with the wording, nobody
knows when some underworked lawyer thinks he might go on to sue the ass off
of everyone in IT.
If someone wants to mirror/host/develop ROCKate further, be my guest. If you
need technical assistance, I can offer guidance, but I probably won't write
a single line of code anymore. Sorry.

I'd be really happy if someone can host it outside Germany. I don't think
they can sue me because I did the work before the law passed.
I can also imagine picking up work again if - when - the smoke clears.
Just for now, I'm not too keen to go to jail for some stupid law that outlaws
tools instead of use.

Well, german courts might that Tor is a popular link in attack vectors.
Maybe I'm a bit paranoid here, just not taking chances here.
The whole security industry in Germany is currently up in arms. The wording
of the law actually outlaws programs like nmap, wireshark and tcpdump as well
as outlaws usage of actual Virii and Trojans to test defenses.
Phenoelit shut down its german website where programs such as debuggers for
windows, SAP exploits and various brute forcers were hosted.

A rough estimate is that the ISO images have caused around 30-40 GB of
BitTorrent traffic. I have no data about the subversion repository.
The website should be in the sizes of dozens of MB.

If some of you have a non-x86 machine and some CPU cycle to spare, I'd

I have received some offers for this, thank you!
Here's the general way to do it:
First, get a copy of the subversion tree:
This will create a directory `rockate-trunk' with the latest codebase. Next,
run this command:
You will be presented with an ncurses based configuration menu. You only have
to make changes in the uppermost block of options:
Optionally (I suggest you do it) also select the option
"Stop building if a package build fails".
Then leave the menu and run these commands:
The compile process will start and - probably - fail.
If the compile fails for the package blafasel, then the complete compile
output can be found in:
Here you can see why the problem fail. To make changes to the way the package
is built, edit the file target/tor/pkg_blafasel.conf and adjust it. Look in
the file package/*/blafasel/blafasel.conf to see how it is compiled right now.
Also, look into other *.conf files to get an idea of what you can do in these
files (it's a _lot_).
When you made your changes, run:
Lather, rinse, repeat.
This is also documented on:
Unfortunately, I leave for Italy today and won't be online for the rest of
the month. But you can ask any questions you have in  on freenode.
It's a low-traffic channel, so be patient and repeat the question every two
hours or so.
Thanks for your efforts and see you in July!

I already thought about encryption. I plan to use it for /home both in the live
and in the installed version. Although, I never used truecrypt. As for now
I use cryptsetup-luks to set up encryption.
Also, IIRC truecrypt is proprietary. Does its license allow bundling?
Redistribution? What about cross-platform compatibility?

ROCKate currently runs on 2.6.21.3 so I guess it's fine.
Key management is an implementation detail and should be of no concern
to ROCKate users.
Last update is over a year old. Which parts do apply to todays kernel?

@_author: Benjamin Schieder 
@_subject: [ANNOUNCE] ROCKate Tor LiveCD V0.4.0.0 
Okay, so it's not GPL. Does it include any kernel level code? Because if it
does, I don't want to get into the whole distribute-non-GPL-kernel-modules
I don't really care about Win32. Preferably, ROCKate encrypted block devices
could only be read from within ROCKate. Guess that won't happen, though.
What I meant with Cross-platform is: sparc, x86_64, ppc, arm?

Nope, don't want to get into that trouble at all. I can easily make it
possible to use truecrypt if it's installed, but unless Linus and the FSF
themselve say that it's legally okay to distribute non-GPL compiled kernel
modules I won't include it in ROCKate. Sorry.

Well, personally I'm for luks, unless there are reasons against it. I'm
no cryptographer, so I have to look at people with the respective knowledge
Apart from that, as developer of ROCKate I consider it my job to make stuff
as accessible as possible without compromising security. This goes for a
preconfigured FireFox as it goes for filesystem encryption.
So far, I've seen three ways of doing filesystem encryption:
1) simply enter a passphrase, it gets hashed to a key one-way-or-another
   (hashalot, luks)
2) create the dm-crypt table, encrypt it with a gpg key. on reboot, request
   gpg key passphrase, pipe the table back to dm-setup
3) let the user select a cipher and then enter a passphrase (may be combined
   with 1, seen with loop-aes
4) Let the user do it manually
These are listed in decreasing convenience.
Since running `dmsetup table' still gives the required line to decrypt the
block device and LiveCDs generally do not have a secure `root' account,
running `dmsetup remove my_tor_home' after mount should be obvious.
(Yes, one can still read it through other means, but hey, don't make it
 too easy)
The need is a Tor LiveCD.

@_date: 2007-06-22 08:00:33
@_author: Benjamin Schieder 
@_subject: [ANNOUNCE] ROCKate Tor LiveCD V0.4.0.0 
The mount will stay (and appear as /dev/mapper/my_tor_home on /home). It's
just the /dev/mapper_my_tor_home device and entry in `dmsetup table' that
will vanish.
That's the one. I don't intend to have a Tor server LiveCD.
The good thing is: The ROCK Linux initrd already supports exactly that.
It's how I set up my root-on-raid and encrypted-home-on-raid before
booting the system.

- glibc 2.5
- Tor 0.1.2.24

The privoxy rule by itself won't work in most cases. At least my
installation of firefox does use this:
GET  HTTP/1.1
Host: X-SomeHeaders: value
The Host: will be modified, but not the GET. This is still futile since
I encountered many a webserver ignoring the Host: header with the query
as above.

Hi List.
I just finished testing and uploading ROCKate Version 0.3.
* updated to Tor 0.1.2.13
* added transparent Tor routing to config dialog
* added runtime update mechanism
* now has its own hidden website at:  ISO Images are available here:
For the next version I plan to include tor-dns-proxy. Any other software you
may wish to have included, please tell me. Wishes with pointers on HowTo
install/torify it and maybe plugins (gaim and OTR, for example) will be
prioritised :)
Also, in a few days (got a long weekend coming up) I will put up a public SVN
of the build tree seperate from the official ROCK Linux tree. Getting patches
applied in the ROCK tree is just a pain at the moment.

Interesting. Why isn't this listed in the help for hide-tor-exit-notation?
I've been searching for a viable solution for this for a while.
Also, would it be possible to do it the other way around? Inserting an
existing exit node notation into links in the page?

For me that only reads like it's not allowed to rent the server to third
parties. There's nothing in there about anonymous users or such.

You're the law student, you tell us :-)
But I agree that it can be extended to Tor/Open Proxies, even 'knowingly'
running vulnerable software that allows people to send spam over your
SMTP server. Basically, it can be extended to say: You may not have any
service running on your server.
And that's where I think the argumentation is void.
You are not allowing them to use the server (as in shell account) but
provide a service (as in open port to connect to).
In the end, it's a matter of interpretion.

And that is exactly why you use Tor's TransPort to route all traffic that
is not already Tor traffic through Tor.
Happy guessing where I'm from :-)
