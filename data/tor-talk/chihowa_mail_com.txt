Hmmm.  I've been trying to track down a regular kernel panic that occurs when I leave Tor running for several hours.  My hardware passes the tests on the Apple diagnostic CD, and Tor doesn't use more than 5% cpu, so it's not a heat issue.  I had dismissed Tor as the source of the problem out of hand because I couldn't imagine how it could cause a kernel panic.
I can't remember if it started when I went to 1.0.2rc or .3rc, but it wasn't a problem with 0.9.7.  I'll start digging in to it this week.  I'm pretty swamped at the moment, but I'll contribute what I can.  Oh, this is OS 10.3.9.

After posting this, I realized that I was havong these problems on Mac OS 10.3.8.  After upgrading to 10.3.9, the crashing seems to have passed.  This was obviously a Mac OS problem; a user-space program shouldn't be able to bring the kernel down.  So hopefully, it's Rod, Eddie: after going to 10.3.9 are the problems gone?

I'm not a lawyer, but I'd think that a published list of servers could be quite helpful in a legal defense, if it ever came to that for
