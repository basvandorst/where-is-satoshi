@_subject: [tor-talk] allowing access to LAN IPs 
Hash: SHA512
Hi everybody,
It's my first post here, I'm part of the team developing Tails.
In the context of the development of Tails we want Firefox to allow
connecting to webservers on LAN (RFC-1918) IPs. For example, some users
might want to use an Etherpad installation on the local network before
publishing their text on a blog.
To access those resources, the user would have to type the IP of the
local server in the location bar, and not its hostname, in order to
bypass Tor DNS.
Our initial plan is just to use FoxyProxy rules to grant direct access
(without proxy) to LAN IPs.
With this setup, we couldn't think about an attack which would be made
possible by allowing this only: if an attacker in control of both local
and online resources tries to de-anonymize a local user accessing online
resources, this user could be de-anonymized anyways by other means, we
believe this true by design with Tor.
If such an attack is still possible we also thought about modifying
Torbutton to treat LAN IPs as 'local' and not 'online', just as it does
for URLs such as 'file:///'.
What do you think of this idea?
Can you think about possible attacks that would defeat our plan?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Call for testing new tools and instructions to get 
We are aware that the process of getting started with Tails
(downloading, verifying, installing, starting, and configuring) might be
the main stumbling block for its wider adoption.
Over 2015, we have worked very hard to make this process easier and
today we are happy to release a first beta version of the new process.
We worked on:
1. A Firefox add-on to automate the verification of the ISO image,
   written by Giorgio Maone, the author of NoScript.
2. The inclusion of Tails Installer directly in Ubuntu (and Debian
   really soon), to avoid burning a DVD, using two USB sticks, or going
   through the command line.
3. New instructions on the website to present the process
   step-by-step, according to your operating systems, skills, and
   available hardware.
We would love to have many diverse people test it and tell us what
they think. For example, if you tried to install or verify Tails in
the past but failed, your feedback will be much appreciated!
It would be most helpful to point out:
  - Technical problems. If you think that something technical failed
    during the process, try to describe in details what you were
    trying to do and how it failed.
  - Usability problems. If you fail to understand something, point us
    to the part that is unclear; if you get a result different from
    what you expected, tell us what surprised you in a bad way.
    Please don't report problems that you think other people might
    face, unless you are a usability expert
  - Victories. For example, tell us if you found this super cool or
    if it helped you install Tails for the first time!
    details to improve but we wanted to give you all an opportunity to
    try it out before it replaces the current documentation on the
    website.
If you're ready to give it a try, visit:
    Please send your feedback to tails-testers at boum.org.

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor + twitter issues 
Just right now Twitter asked us (Tails_live) for a phone number.
We registered a disposable phone number this summer to be able to
generate an app key. And now they're asking for that phone number as we
connect through Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] [Tails-dev] Persistent Tor start in Tails vs 
We're in a quite abstract cross-distro Tor discussion, so let's go for
Unless I missed something, right now the entry guard concept is not
explained nor advertised to the user at all. As a user of Tor Browser or
Tails, the only wait to learn about entry guards is, first to be aware
of this behavior of Tor, and then to infer its status from the Tor
Browser circuit view or Vidalia in Tails.
If we think that the relationship between location and entry guard is a
meaningful information, for the mobile user for example, maybe the name
of the entry guard could at least be fed back somehow before the
connection takes place, in Tor Launcher or whatever connection process
will might come up with in Tails.
I'll keep this idea in mind while working on
 Thanks for the point!

So far we use it for our main developer to developer chat room
(tails-dev). But anybody can join.
At some point we'd also like to replace the  at irc.oftc.net chat
room that is preconfigured in Pidgin in Tails [1]. Which means that
anybody who opens Tails can get in there in one click. That's used a lot
for user support, random questions, etc.
This cannot be moved to conference.riseup.net as we need XMPP accounts
to be generated on the fly, as people boot Tails a new account should be
generated. I'm not sure this is possible with XMPP or if any server
offers this.
If you know of any solution to that, please tell us!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Torify deja-dup 
I've been testing pretty much all the backup solutions available on
Linux to find a good match for Tails (so far in vain):
I found both the interface and the backend of Deja Dup too limiting for
our use case (for example, it forces full copies every now and then,
which can be really tough when working over Tor).
For my personal backups I ended up using borgbackup which has a much
much better backend but no graphical interface. Though, if you can
handle a couple of command lines, I didn't find it complicated and I
think it's really worth it over Deja Dup. To connect to onion services
from Tails I'm using:
SOCKS_SERVER=127.0.0.1:9050 borg create two
