This conversation is a little tired.
The tinfoil hats are going to see any funding of Tor by the US government as evidence that Tor is really a front for it and/or pwned by it.
Others are going to disagree, pointing out that money is spent in public on items on a roadmap. Is there likely to be a meeting of the minds or just a really long thread that proves nothing to anyone? :-)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Firefox vs. Tor Browser Bundle release cycles 
Firefox ESR 17.0.11 indeed turns out (somewhat confusingly) to be?
equivalent to Firefox ESR 24.1.1, and the TBB based on ESR 17.0.11 was?
released only four days after Mozilla's updates, which frankly deserves?
praise. TBB's latest code is only one release behind Mozilla's on security?
ESR17 has hit end of life at Mozilla and won?t be receiving any more security updates. There was no 17.0.12 released yesterday, for example. In order for TBB to be current for recent security updates, it needs to be off of the ESR24 branch.
That said, outside of the advisories, the bugs for a given release of Firefox are not opened to the public for a minimum of six weeks (one release cycle) following a release and sometimes a bit more as to avoid any self-zero day events.
So I was wrong about precisely how far TBB is behind the latest ESR?
release on security patches, but like I said before, at some point the?
latest TBB is either shipping known-vulnerable Firefox code or it's not.?
From the visual bottom of?
 it looks like?
Firefox ESR 17.0.11 included security patches from Firefox ESR 24.1.1, so?
my understanding is that TBB is at least potentially vulnerable to the?
known, patched vulnerabilities in the list above.?
No, ESR 17.0.11 included some ESR 24.1.1 patches. There is not a 1:1 mapping. The codebase is different and the same fixes are not always applied to the older codebase, either due to lack of defect but also sometimes due to overall code changes that make it difficult or dangerous to apply the patches.

Yes but good luck with that. Mozilla and Tor are both aware of the possibilities involving looking at checkins, code changes, and binary diffs.
An adversary could potentially dig through current Firefox release code,?
diff it against relevant portions of the code base used to build the Tor?
Browser Bundle, and then infer potentially exploitable vulnerabilities?
that TBB users might also be vulnerable to.?

Again, I wonder what you?re doing to fix this issue or is this really just an informational awareness campaign?
Anyone paying attention knows there is a delta between TBB and Mozilla releases. I can?t comment on why that?s the case as I don?t know the TBB build, QA, or releases processes.
The fact that users are running releases that are older than the current TBB is a separate issue and one that has been brought up here and elsewhere before. Part of this is the lack of an auto-update mechanism, which I believe is being worked on, and that users are, frankly, a bit thick at times and don?t pay attention to things.?
As to Firefox release dates, you could always look at our Wiki:?

@_author: Al Billings 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Firefox vs. Tor Browser Bundle release cycles 
I?ll also add that a two or three day delta on releases (which is most of those listed) is pretty damned good.
The bugs in those releases aren?t public. Diffing changes and trying to contract zero days is actually quite hard as well. If you were talking about a month long difference in dates, I?d be more concerned.
Also, all bugs aren?t created equal. As you can see looking at the Firefox Known Vulnerabilities page at? most of the fixes are not sec-critical rated bugs. Sec-critical and (some) sec-high rated issues are the ones that give a real possibility for drive by zero days. Even then, many of these have no known weaponized exploit and are simply dangerous in theory. One of the things Mozilla does before a sec-critical or sec-high bug goes in is look at how easy it is to weaponize as well as where in the ship cycle the release is in order to avoid long windows of exposure after checkin. Two or three days on top of that is not the primary danger.
If you want to focus on greater and lesser degrees of danger, I?d say focus on why ESR versus mainline Firefox releases for TBB?s basis (and the fact that the current TBB is from a now out of support ESR17 branch).
Otherwise, this conversation isn?t terribly useful, as much as you may find it interesting. :-)

Mozilla runs a completely open, documented, and transparent release process.
The dates are published basically six months in advance (and more like a year if you count in six week increments). We?ve moved one date (the next one) in the last 18 months, I think. See?
We freeze and build a week before release. You can watch the hg repository, which is public, for when we bump the version numbers, which locks down the release. For example:

You can build as soon as the tree is frozen in hg. You?ll have to watch in case an emergency build 2 or 3 happens, which does occur, but you could build six to seven days before Firefox is released, which is what we do in order to give our QA time. All that happens on release day is we push to mirrors. There is no magic then.

I would assume they were digging into the origins of the Silk Road, tracking down references as you quote below. It isn't clear how they actually got his name and if they had it before customs intercepted him importing fake IDs. The paperwork claims that this was a random customs check but that could easily be misinformation and they had his name on a list or somesuch.

There are exploits all the time in various operating systems and tools. Given how old your OS is, there are core things that are simply not addressed in it. You're effectively playing on the Internet with a loaded gun as every time there is a bad exploit that a OS vendor fixes (such as Apple in your case), you don't get the fix.

Good luck with that. Having an OS that isn't missing years and years of security updates isn't being paranoid or being engaged in "social control" by a vendor. It isn't the "bleeding edge" either. It is simply being secure. If your operating system isn't getting regular security updates, you're insecure. The longer it goes on, the more insecure you are. You'd be much better off running something like Linux if you're concerned about vendor control but want to be secure.

Yes but you have to choose to view the original html or it doesn?t do anything. So, by default, users will not be automatically exploited. They have to get a bad email and then choose menu options for that one email to then be able to click on a link which then might have content?
This is why it was considered a ?moderate? security issue. It isn?t a drive by exploit where you send mail to people and then something happens to them. They have to actively cooperate to be exploited. It is a bug, yes, but it isn?t as bad as was being painted the other day here.
