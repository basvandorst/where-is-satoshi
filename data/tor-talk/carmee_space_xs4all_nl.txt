@_subject: So TOR is NOT  really anonoymous!? 
Mentioned URL asks your browser to download a java applet.
Java applets run locally on your machine. So they can do
anything you can do locally, including resolving your real IP.
In firefox one can also turn of downloading applets by unchecking 'Allow
websites to install software'.
Have fun, don't blame tor for you downloading applets,

@_subject: exitpolicy question 
Space's exitpolicy does not allow for IRC. This is because my provider
asked me to set it that way. My tor process however tries to
connect to remote IRC ports anyway. Iptables prevents it and also
identifies tor as the process doing it. It happens a few times a day.
I wonder what's happening.

(wth is the jhohnbalance router for?)
To answer the question: it is connecting to 195.72.0.6 mostly,
but _not_ exclusivily. Other IP's from /var/log/messages* are:
Aug  6 DST=213.92.8.4
Aug 16 DST=82.126.208.33
Aug 17 DST=84.81.231.189
Aug 18 DST=84.81.231.189
Aug 22 DST=81.208.84.20

@_subject: exitpolicy question 
ahum: 84.81.231.189 was me testing my iptables, so
forget about that. 82.126.208.33 and 81.208.84.20
can be non-tor packets (different behaviour, no related
process logged on those days).
So only 213.92.8.4 (calvino.freenode.net) seems to be
real tor traffic.

@_subject: exitpolicy question 
Yes I figured that out :)
Still I have a faint feeling there's something special about this one:
it makes my node do unexpected things. Things like connecting to port 6667
in spite of my ExitPolicy.

@_subject: reconsidering default exit policy 
Yes you could, but a lot of standard stuff uses IRC ports.
Two months ago I was disconnected from the net by my provider because
of abuse via IRC. Luckily I only needed to mention Tor to get back up
again. That is: after blocking IRC.
Maybe excluding IRC in the default ExitPolicy would prevent some abuse
problems and frustration. And I can tell you: getting disconnected is
very frustating, up to the point of madness :)

@_subject: IRC zombie controllers 
Please correct me if I'm wrong:
My understanding is that there is also some policy to make tor as
userfriendly as possible. We like a lot of users, because the greater
the number, the safer and better the tor network.
In other words: All Lusers Must Like Tor.
Then I say 'block IRC by default', because ISP's will shut them down
one day. They will (by definition) not go into setting ExitPolicy
settings right themselves.
On this list already two have mentioned to have been disconnected
because of irc via tor.

@_subject: ideal server config? 
I read most of the site but I could not find an answer to the following
question. Sorry if I overlooked it (in that case please point me to
where the answer could be found).
I wonder if there is any _ideal_ server exit policy for the tor network.
What's best for overall performance and/or what's best for project
development? Or is it variation in policies that's good?
Thank you for your attention,

@_subject: Tor SwitchProxy howto 
I'm using this configuration for a few weeks now and I recommend it.
After reading the howto I would like to suggest a small addition:
Sometimes I want to switch to another proxysetting to temporarily have
a faster (but non-anonymous) connection. It should be noted that when
shifting to another proxysetting, by default the page that's currently
active will be reloaded through the new proxysetting.
So: one should first be on the page where anonimity is not an issue;
loaded through the tor/privoxy settings. Then only after that switch
to another setting and have it reloaded.
Btw: this automatic reloading default can be unset.

@_subject: upgraded server not responsive? 
I upgraded to 0.1.0.10 and the fingerprint changed.
So I re-registered it as a server. Now more than 12 hours
later I'm still listed as an 'unresponsive' server[1]. I'm
pretty sure I'm using the same configuration and firewall.
So what am I doing wrong. Thanks :)

Hash: SHA1
I spent some time fiddling with ~/.tor/cached-directory to see
how my server performs in comparison to other servers.
I ended up with attached bash script.
I'm sure it can be done better but hey it's nice :)

@_subject: Tor and port 80 
It should be possible to write a small server listening on port 80 that
does something like this:
if traffic exactly is tor server traffic
   route/nat/tunnel to internal tor port
   route/nat/tunnel to internal httpd port
