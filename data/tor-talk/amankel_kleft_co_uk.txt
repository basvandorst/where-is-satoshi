@_subject: [tor-talk] Proton Mail and Tutanota - not exactly Tor friendly. 
Hey there,
According to my knowledge the only check protonmail performs is a GeoIP-Filter which can be disabled in the web app settings. (1)
If your authentication logs are set to basic or advanced, this may be a reason for the challenge. If they really believe in what's written on their about-page they should be Tor-friendly too ;)
Kind Regards,
Andre Mankel
