This issue has been ongoing for months now.
I think I read Ioerror write he isn't interested in fixing the bug for Windows, but Sukhbir is willing (yet unable to even reproduce the bug). This bug is NOT only for Windows, it's for many OSes.
Is TorBirdy going the way of Vidalida?
All of these bug reports seem to be the same issue?
 (Windows 7 & FreeBSD)
 (Xubuntu)
 (Windows 7 & Ubuntu)
 (LinuxMint)

That is why I wrote the original message. This bug is most definitely a blocker for many people. I imagine lots of users try to install TorBridy, find once they do Thunderbird no longer loads its GUI, so they freak out(!) (as most users aren't advanced, I imagine). Even if they manage to find the bug reports and learn to create a new profile, that's not a fix, and I bet less than 10% of new users will even find the bug reports (I think most will curse the Tor Project and had a very bad taste in their mouth).
I understand it's hard to fix Jake, but I think there should be more awareness about this huge issue. At least for new users that are hit with the bug and don't know how to get their email program to even Right now there's very little awareness of the bug, and those that are hit with it are left with no recourse is they don't find the bug reports (so they learn to have to create a new profile to even get Thunderbird GUI to load).
Thanks Jake, for everything you're doing! I am not trying to 'dis' you, I am just trying to get wider awareness of this huge issue to try and get more help (I am not a programmer so I'm of little help). I love TorBirdy, but for a long time I've been unable to use it, because I really don't like having to create a new profile -- it's just to messy.

I have posted in  that using a new profile allows Thunderbird to load when TorBirdy is enabled (Windows 7). I was unaware of the error console feature; I will create another new profile and test as you requested, posting any relent info to Could you list any and all steps you wish people to do to help you track down this issue? I'm more than willing to assist, but I need hand-holding to know how to assist.
Also, how about all those tickets get merged into one? It seems not helpful to have so many tickets for seemingly the same issue.
Thanks Sukhbir, for you efforts and caring! :)
