Correct me if I'm mistaken, but I believe the laws do not require
holding onto the content of the call/data, just the routing information
or phone numbers. If so, it's interesting to note that that's exactly
what Tor is for - defeating _traffic_ analysis.
It will be interesting to see how Europe's reaction to
radicalism/terrorism compares with the US's. Hopefully, it doesn't turn
into politicians flinging poo and "soft on terrorism" charges at each

@_subject: Tor limitation 
Isn't the EFF more geared toward defending digital rights in the US?
Sure, the slogan is "Defending Freedom in the Digital World," but most
of their activities are obviously US-centric. Things like the "How to
Blog Safely" (
document are "exportable" (at least for English readers), but I don't
believe they've gotten involved with foreign governments like they have
with the US government, right?
Anyway, for a bit of perspective on the "Chinese version of the
internet", so to speak, check out this post from EastSouthWestNorth:
Choice quote:
"Since people in China have never been free to express their political
views in public, not being able to do so in cyberspace isn't actually
viewed as a sacrifice. People don't feel like they're giving anything
up. On the contrary, they feel that blogs and other forms of online
social media have given them a great deal more freedom of expression
than they ever had before."
As for China exit nodes and Tor, it'd be fine to have middleman/entry
nodes as well as directory servers AFAICT. I'm hoping anyone in China
considering running a Tor server would recognize that people on the
network wouldn't appreciate exiting from a node in China...

Definitely. I've felt much the same way myself, along with all the anger
and rage at hearing of huge companies like Yahoo, Google, Microsoft,
Cisco, all helping the Chinese government in varying degrees to limit
the internet.
Their excuse is that they must comply with local government laws. I
don't really believe the people that make those decisions at those companies are all greedy, evil, or morally bankrupt, though. I think they
really believe China /will/ eventually become more open and democratic.
Indeed, access to the internet, even if it is limited, may very well
allow change to happen faster than it would otherwise. Maybe I'm being
way too optimistic.
But, I guess we've kind of strayed off the topic of Tor now. So, how
about that exit node problem?

@_subject: Getting Unblocked at Wikipedia 
I was under the impression that Wikipedia, Gentoo Forums, /., et al
grabbed the list of tor exit nodes every so often to use in their black
lists; so once you're no longer an exit node and they refresh their
black lists, you should be effectively unblocked. You could probably get unblocked through  on irc.freenode.net.

That's likely not the fault of Tor, but rather a random scan for
vulnerabilities in your web server. I say that with tenative confidence.
If you get the error regularly, perhaps you could create an empty file
called "\x13BitTorrent protocol\x80" in your httpd's root directory and
see if it goes away.

@_subject: Directory Server 
Yes, the directory servers are a trust bottleneck. There are currently
only a handful (6, I believe) of trusted authorities whose IP addresses
are hard-coded into the Tor source code. While a well-funded attacker
can create a large amount of Tor nodes, the attacker would also have to
social engineer the developers to become a directory authority.
I think 2 of the directory authorities are run by Roger, one of the lead
Tor developers. If you don't trust him, you probably shouldn't be using
his software ;).
Sorry about the fuzzy numbers, hoped that helps regardless,

I can't speak as to when it'll happen, but the Dapper version works fine
on Edgy. I recently walked an Ubuntu-using friend of mine through the
same situation.

Yes, this is what I said in my original message. I worked fine as of 3

I experienced this for the first time yesterday. Attempting to go to
legitsite.com redirected me to something that looked like a domain
squatter page - but the domain in the address bar of my browser was
legitsite.com. Quite an interesting attack :)

Hey Stephen,
Have you looked into Tor's logs for any error messages? I believe you
can access Tor's logs through the Vidalia interface.
Some guesses:
- If you're running a Tor node with a dynamic IP, you should check that
  your IP address didn't change.
- Do you have "Address" set in your torrc? It should be set to either a
  "fully qualified domain name" (fqdn) or an IP address. If it's not
  set, Tor will guess your IP. I'm not sure if Tor can "recover" from
  your IP dynamically changing, though.
Apologies for not being more sure. Hope that helps some, though!

Hello all,
I was just linked to an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education
about Tor:
An assistant professor at Bowling Green State University is confronted
by the university's network people about his use and advocacy of Tor.
He's a bit lax with the technical details, but it's interesting to see
Tor in a mainstream publication :).

It takes quite a while until your node becomes more heavily used. Tor
clients take your node's uptime into account when considering whether or
not to route through it. Higher uptime indicates a more stable node,
which will get more traffic.
In other words, everything's fine, just sit tight for a day or two :).
Thanks for helping the Tor network!

@_subject: Public lists of exit nodes? 
The list of exit nodes is public. It isn't maintained by users - it's
created by the network.
It probably takes "a while" for every directory server and Tor client to
receive an updated directory listing with any given invalid node
