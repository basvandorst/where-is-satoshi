@_subject: [tor-talk] Measuring on-line anonymity 
Hi, is there a way to measure the level of anonymity on a system?
For example Signal es a very good keeping secret on communications, but is very bad for anonymity as it need a real phone number to work. Using a real phone number to communicate makes an association of all your chats with your real identity. In many countries in latinamerica you need to give you document id to get a phone number.[1] It is also a centralized service so that the sysadmins and the people behind Signal can have a look at the metadata if they want.
Ricochet is way better to protect anonymity. I don’t need a phone number, not even a name, I just use the onion service hostname. With Richochet I am anonymous all the time unless I identify myself.
Email may not be as good as Signal for end to end encryption (even with pgp), but it can be way better for anonymity. For instance, this email account was created using Tor in Protonmail, and there are other mail providers that allow me to this. If I always use Protonmail with Tor, it is very hard for Protonmail to learn who am I and where I live, doing that with Signal is harder. However with Ricochet is way easier.
Is there a way to measure the “level o anonymity”. I am very interested in comparing email, chat and voip tools to find out witch tool is better for anonymity. For instance in email is hard to be anonymouse to the server provider and in Signal is even harder, however in Ricochet is very simple as there is no service provider.
[1] Actually you don’t need to use your real phone number, advance users can do tricks. That is not for everyone.

Thanks, lots of good stuff!!!
What I meant is that is easier to stay anonyumouse on a system like Ricochet.

Hi I would like to know your thoughts about anonymity and voip. I would like to know if it is possible to hide the fact that Alice is talking to Bob and that content of the communication is secure of course.
I see that Whonix people have thought about this before and have a nice Wiki page:
They recommend Tox and Mumble. Would something like Ring would work over Tor? Have you try Mumble as hidden service?
Thanks a lot !

So my understunding is that I could use any IP protocol and communicate with each other as if we where in a LAN. Is that right? If so is there any FLOSS VOIP program that allows me to comunicate directly to other IP without the need of a server?

[....] I don't want hide who am I  to the other end. I want to hide the fact that I am calling someone and that the conversation actually took place.
So Alice wants to talk to Bob but neither of them want anybody to know that the conversation happend. If the conversation is end to end encrypted no one should now that they where talking and that the converation happend. So from my understunding there is anonymity in the fact that they are separeting from the act of having  a conversation. Am I right?
Please if you want to be philosophical about it go ahead. I really want to improve my understunding of anonymity and privacy.

For the record. I did some tests with Mumble and it works great. The test where made from Linux and with Plumble + Orbot in Android.
I can conect to the onion service when I start Mumble with torify, but when I try to configure proxy socks it doesn't work:
hostname: 127.0.0.1
port: 9050
TCP only
I did try to do onioncat with Linphone no success yet, but is more a configuration on Linphone than other thing. I need to configure it to use de ipv6 address of the tunnel that OnionCat creates and not the one of the physical interface. Thanks a lot!!!

I respect the EFF for all of its work, but I don't understund this one. So if I have PGP to protect my email, their solution is to stop using PGP because someone could read my encripted mails. So now everyone would be able to read all of may emails. Wouldn't be better to ask people to disable HTML on email and to upgrade their email clients to stay protected.
I know PGP is not perfect, but it is the best we have for email. I know email is not perfect but it is more or less descentralize. Why should be stop using email in favor of something such as Signal (recomendation from EFF article) that is centralize and we should trust the guys running the server are good guys. I understund that Signal has great security features like foreward secrecy that PGP doesn't. I know it is open source, but you are forbid to installed from free repostiories such as Fdroid.
Also you can not use Signal if you don't have a phone number. How great is that for anonymity. In the country where I am living you can not activiate a mobile phone number without your national id. I am writing this email from Protonmail wich I only connect from Tor. I don't really trust  Protonmail, but I can be anonymouse to them thanks to Tor. Is Signal the replacement to email? I do like the way the Signal protocol negociate offline the keys and that each message is encrypted with a different key. That idea of encryption for asynchronous communication can actually be a good replacement for email, but in a distirbuted network.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Questions about Directory Authority Servers 
From my understanding when a Tor proxy is started it downloads a list of relays from one of the ten  Directory Authority Servers listed here:
Am I right?
If so who run these servers and how the people running them are chosen? I would like to know a bit on the governance on how this authority servers are chosen.
What could go wrong if one or more of these servers are compromise?
Thank you very much!

Coy.im is a nice option. It is OTR and Tor by default and helps you create anonymouse accounts.
