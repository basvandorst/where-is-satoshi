@_subject: [tor-talk] Directory servers and their services 
Good morning to all :),
I'm a tor-newbie.
My interest is, to have a look at tor2web.
I researched, that I have to receive a list from tor-directory servers to be able to use tor2web.
My questions are:
- how do I learn anything about how to reach a directory server and
- how to verify that I really reached a tor-directory server
- how can I receive information about tor2web and
- how do I create a tor-circuit?
I'm using Vidalia 0.2.17|Tor 0.2.2.36
TIA for your help!
