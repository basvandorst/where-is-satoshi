@_subject: [tor-talk] William was raided for running a Tor exit node. 
The only information I've read about the matter is what's on  , and it doesn't provide much regarding the length or complexity of the investigation. From that webpage, the information I find relevant is:
(1-1) the exit node was located in Poland, and therefore outside the jurisdiction of the LKA;
(1-2) William had already been questioned by Polish LEA about activities coming from the exit node;
(1-3) the exit node was moved to a different ISP after the troubles with the Polish LEA;
(1-4) the exit node wasn't turned back on.
What we _do_not_ know is:
(2-1) what country the clearnet forum (that the child porn was posted to) is located in;
(2-2) who reported the child porn to LEA, or if LEA was already monitoring for the child porn;
(2-3) if Polish and Austrian LEA are cooperating on the investigation;
(2-4) when the investigation was initiated;
(2-5) which LEA initiated the investigation.
Given the information above, it's a completely reasonable scenario that the child porn was reported by the clearnet forum owner, or discovered by some LEA, at which time the offending forum user's IP was determined to belong to the Polish host of the exit node. When compelled, the Polish host provided the details of William Weber. The LKA are then able to raid William on the suspicion of child porn distribution, and they seize everything that could be used to store the material.
You (Steven Naslund) question why no LEA seized the exit node. This is explained by the fact that the exit node was moved from the Polish host _after_ the child porn was posted to the clearnet forum. It's completely reasonable that LEA may not have been able to determine where the server was moved to.
You also question the reasons for the LKA to raid his private residence when the exit node's last known location was a Polish host. Surely you aren't suggesting that LEA shouldn't raid a suspect's private residence because the last known location of a (missing) server (that is confirmed to belong to the suspect) wasn't the same address?
Your opposition to this matter is moving into land of the crazy conspiracy-theorist. You're looking so hard for something more sinister to the story that you're ignoring reason. We should only take positions on the evidence we have, not the evidence we don't have.

I agree the scenario you described is absurd, but I don't agree it's absurd to be paranoid or practical when your activities (like running an exit node) may result in you being raided.
I was raided in 2010 because of false allegations made by a cranky former employer. It was a very unpleasant experience and it's the reason why I run relays instead of exit nodes. The raid resulted in the seizure of all "electronic devices with storage capabilities" that were at my personal residence, in my vehicle, and on my person; it didn't include my hosted servers or offsite backups.
Unfortunately, this meant that my mobile phone (work and personal use), tablet (personal use), and laptop (work use) were seized because they were on me when the raid occurred. Fortunately, I'm paranoid/practical and had a mobile phone, laptop, and recent backups stored at my parents' house. Having these backups in place required a little effort and upfront cost, but it allowed me to return to work and studies with minimal disruption.

SE sites are great for getting answers to specific questions but the
Q&A format doesn't encourage open-ended discussion.
Am I right to assume this isn't an official forum?
Why did you decide on a US host?
TBH, I don't think I'd use the forum because the mailing list is
pretty convenient.

Hi tor-talk,
I'm not sure where else to ask this question so I give my apologies if this is off-topic. Please feel free to suggest a better list/forum/website.
I've had a personal email account with GMail since it was invite-only, but lately I've read a few stories about Google's use of our emails to provide better targeted advertising to its users. These stories make me uncomfortable and, continuing with my (slow) changeover from Google services and products, I would like to change.
In no particular order, what I would like from the email provider is:
  * Privacy-conscious (don't parse my emails to target advertisements to   * Reasonable storage space (I have currently have 418 emails using ~100MB in my personal GMail account)
  * Don't close the account if I don't log in with the web interface in {X} days
  * IMAP preferred but POP will suffice
  * Free would be nice (I don't want to lose my email account if I lose my job)
Anonymous-/encryption-type services offered by HushMail or Safe-Mail aren't a priority for me; I mostly want something reliable, long-lasting, and not doing a Google on my emails.
I appreciate your advice.

Hi tor-talk,
Thanks for the information about email providers.
Obviously, I currently use Lavabit but this email, and activity it's used with, is kept separate from my "real life". My "real life" email has been on GMail for a long time, which is what needs to change. Two things I really like about Lavabit: that they've published their infrastructure setup, and the simplicity of signing up. Two things I don't like about Lavabit: location is in USA (I may have missed more location details, though), and the email sender's IP is in the headers. Because of the latter, I'm not convinced to use them as my personal email provider just yet.
I really like everything I read about Autistici. I applied for an email account but regardless if they approve of me/my reasons, I'm happy to donate to support them. Those guys have a great message.
I'll check out the providers mentioned and report back on my experiences in case anyone's interested.

I hope I didn't sound as though I was looking for a free meal in my original posting when I said that a free service would be nice; I really would be concerned that if I no longer had a job that I wouldn't be able to keep my email account.
You do make a good point, however, and I'd like to give an anecdote to support your message. It wasn't until I volunteered for local activist and atheist groups that I realised how important donations are to some causes. These guys were surviving solely on donations from the public. As a result, I happily donate to groups that I think are doing a great service, and I encourage others to do the same (because really, who can't spare $20 for a good cause that can spare $20 a week for overpriced coffee?)

Great link. Interesting site.
(It's amazing that the web is so vast that after 15 years online, there are still websites tucked away that I haven't seen.)
I would be interested in your data. Do you have any problems uploading it to mainstream file sharing sites? You could encrypt it and send tor-talk the passphrase. Or perhaps upload it to a .onion (I don't know any off-hand).

The link you provided in your first response ( says Autistici offer 5 aliases. I didn't read any confirmation of this on their website, so it may or may not be accurate. If I'm approved for email, I'll let tor-talk know.

@_subject: [tor-talk] No free Hushmail account if signing up using TBB 
When I signup at Hushmail while using TBB I no longer see option for a
free account, only the premium accounts. I've closed TBB several times
and get the same options at Hushmail. Could anyone else confirm this?

I'm not using Hushmail for their "security" but because I can create a
throwaway  account in 30 seconds. Well, it used to; I
can't find a way to get the free account while using TBB so I'll need
to find a new host. Do you know of any?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Recommended method for updating an existing TBB 
I've had problems updating my existing TBB software and wanted to get
some feedback. The steps I take are:
1. Download the latest TBB/Firefox's download directory
2. Extract "tor-browser-2.x.x-{x}_{lang}.exe" in the current directory
3. Cut/paste the newly extracted "Tor Browser" directory over the
existing "C:\Program Files\Tor Browser"
4. Run "Start Tor Browser.exe"
5. TBB/Firefox opens at  and I get the page
for &uptodate=1
I do it this way so I retain plugins, settings, and bookmarks for
TBB/Firefox, but it doesn't appear to be working anymore. Over the last
few releases, step 5 has instead showed the page for &uptodate=0 and I'm
not sure why TBB/Firefox is being detected as an outdated version. To
get past this I just delete the existing "C:\Program Files\Tor Browser"
directory and start fresh with the latest TBB.
How do other users update their existing TBB software?
Are my steps for updating incorrect or unsafe?
Is there a recommended method for updating an existing TBB software?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Recommended method for updating an existing TBB 
Is there official documentation on this? I searched the Tor wiki but
didn't find anything specific. I may have missed it, Trac searching is
(It may not matter, but I wrote "plugins" when I meant "extensions")
I understand that plugins/extensions may leak identifying data, however
I feel I should clarify that I'm not using Tor as a tool to protect my
life. The extensions perform specific tasks - advertisement blocking,
managing cookies, etc - and I haven't been informed that TBB/Firefox
already does these tasks. If TBB/Firefox can handle these tasks then I
have no problem not using the extensions.
I don't agree that changing settings in TBB/Firefox should be
discouraged; you may have meant this in regards to some specific
settings, but you'd have to elaborate for me to be sure. For example, I
routinely enable the "Tell websites I do not want to be tracked" option.
Is this discouraged? Why?
