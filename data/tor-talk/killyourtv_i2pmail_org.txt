Since you're using Apache I think mod-rewrite would be a far better
solution. After all, rewriting URLs is what it does. :)
     * Add a vhost for kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion and rewrite its links from
   to * Add a vhost for whonix.org and just rewrite http -> https (which
  you're doing already).
I have been doing something similar for  /
 (using Apache) and  /
 (using Nginx) (amongst other I2P/clearnet/Tor
sites) for some time now with success.
