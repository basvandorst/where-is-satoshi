@_subject: [tor-talk] Orbot relays not grouped by family 
Hash: SHA256
If I run multiple relays, shouldn't they be grouped into a node family? I
see no way of doing this with Orbot on Android, which lists only an option
for setting the node nickname.

A drone that is controlled via hidden services contacted through cellular
data seems like a good means of maintaining anonymity for drone operators.
There was a WiFi scanning mod of the ParrotAR that did something like this.

Yes, I meant that the drone would receive commands like altitude changes
and coordinates. Real time control would probably not work

There has not been a sustained increase in search traffic for the Pirate
Browser on Google. Tor and "Tor browser" haven't shown a spike in search,
either. Could it be from users in Syria? Also note that the Google Play
Store has been unblocked in Iran, allowing distribution of Orbot/Orweb in
that country to phones with the Play Store app installed (partial
bootstrapping problem).

To answer my own question, Syria had a spike from 1000 to 4000 but that's a
tiny fraction of the recent increase. Iran doubled from 4000 to 8000 which
is also only a part of the increase. Is there a page listing each graph by
country or overlapping them all?

There is an indication that computers are connecting to the "Tor"
anonymizing proxy network from Antarctica. This information is anonymously
self-reported by the connecting client computers and it's entirely possible
that the locations are inaccurate. However, there is also a possibility
that malicious software has been installed on computers in one of your
research stations which is using the Tor network for command-and-control
purposes, unbeknownst to the owners. I would encourage you to investigate
this matter.
I'm an operator of Tor relays and take an interest in the activity on the
network, but I'm not directly affiliated with the Tor
Projectnor do I claim to represent them.
Please refer to their website for further
information and official contact addresses. I've also sent this message to
their mailing list should you wish to follow up, there.

Hello Lee,
I would like to start by stressing the fact that this function is meant for
very advanced users and can damage the device if not done correctly.
Moreover, this function is completely unsupported by Pogoplug and therefore
by preforming any SSH related action to the device, the support and
warranty of the device automatically expires.
Having said that, if you wish to process with this actions, please find the
instructions below:
1. Go to Mac/PC command line and enter the following:
curl --data "" (switch out the IP above with the IP of the Safeplug)
2. At this point, sshd will be running and you should immediately ssh to
the device and change the root password.  The stock root password is:
ssh root at 192.168.7.170
password: ceadmin

Additionally, a popup appears during the debug launch which says "Profile
Missing: Your Firefox profile cannot be loaded. It may be missing or
inaccessible." That message doesn't appear with the launch via GUI and also
the message about TBB being damaged isn't present with the --debug flag set.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Twitter account lockouts for Tor users 
I've noticed that Twitter accounts accessed via Tor have a tendency to lock
due to suspicious activity. This requires a password reset via email or SMS
and may sometimes entail an hour-long delay before Twitter restores access.
I use an alpha[1] Twitter client along with Orbot, both as provided by the
Google Play Store.
Have other Twitter & Tor users seen this same account lock-out?

@_subject: [tor-talk] No SMS auth on Facebook following Tor login 
I logged in to my Facebook account via Tor and it was immediately locked
due to "suspicious activity". After unlocking the account by clicking on
pictures of my Friends I removed my phone number from my account and
attempted to re-verify the number via SMS. This failed with "Sorry, there
was a temporary error sending your confirmation text. Please try again in a
little while or right now."
Repeated attempts have not worked and my support request to Facebook was
closed without any useful information. I noticed an undocumented error code
in the URL: 1549011
Has anyone seen this issue before? (It's not a bug with Tor, obviously)

Does the Tor Project have an official position on this device?

I've had a string of requests from Linode support staff that I block access
to certain IP addresses. They've restricted traffic to my exit node several
times when I've been slow to respond to their requests.
