An interesting point.  I'm not sure I buy it.
In order for this to make sense we need to clarify how giving up some
anonymity to post on Wikipedia is worse than sacrificing the anonymity
you had when you enter a user ID and password to move from a bank's
website login screen to your account information.
In both cases, there is information to protect.  Some form of
identification is a reasonable way to protect that information.  The
nym seems to surrender a lot less identification (at least until the
police search your hard drive) than the user ID.
And when you say "[i]t's not a choice, it's an ultimatum," you imply
that everyone who uses Tor does so to "participat[e] in an interactive
way," or that even if, for example, I never intend to edit a Wikipedia
article, I lose a freedom to do so anonymously, and therefore I lose,
even if I don't perceive a loss.
For this to make sense, we need to understand how this is a greater
loss than the many freedoms we surrendered to form civilization.  In
forming civilization, we collectively agreed to abide by laws, all of
which impinge on freedom in some way, and some of which serve to
facilitate co-existence.
The problem Wikipedia faces with vandalism is a problem with some
people who have not agreed to live by ordinary standards of civilized
conduct.  There's a lot of that on the Internet now; it's sometimes
compared to the Wild West.
An imposition of civilization is a solution to that problem.  And
Wikipedia contributors agreeing to use nyms seems a very civilized
solution.  And just as towns of the Wild West selected a sheriff to
enforce law, Wikipedia is asking contributors for some form of
identification, even if it is only a non-anonymous IP address, so that
rules may be enforced against abusers.
We're touching on some fundamental issues here; I'm not saying you're
wrong, but I think your argument needs better development.
I'd say the Chinese dissident case is a valid one for us to consider.
Even if it isn't so applicable to Wikipedia.
But as I understand it, the nym solution is being developed to satisfy
the Wikipedia folks, but theoretically could be required for other
interactive services as well.  And that certainly *could* be a problem
for our Chinese dissident.

No, no.  You're entirely correct.  And that was my point.
The recognizable entity is not an anonymous entity.
The one thing that's been made clear here is that the nym solution
should be implemented apart from Tor.  As someone posted, those who
adopt this solution would have to accept the implications.
And those implications probably mean this solution is inadequate for
the Chinese dissident.
But as far as Wikipedia is concerned, this apparently doesn't matter.
They don't want first person accounts anyway.  They want *verified*
I'm thinking that limits the value of Wikipedia as an outlet for a
dissident.  While I tremble at the thought of restricting *any* outlet
for dissidents, I'm also inclined to think that Wikipedia would be
correct to limit this sort of information.  Wikipedia is there for a
specific purpose, and I don't really see that purpose as all that
compatible with being an outlet for dissent.
But this leads us to a slippery slope for which I have no answer.  For
in the United States, the current administration has made a
significant effort to stifle dissent.  The Joe Wilson/Valerie Plame
case is perhaps the most visible example of this.  At the moment it
appears likely that the rabid right is in serious trouble; we may be
safe for now.  But even as of a month ago, there was a considerable
amount of verifiable information--which I would venture to say was
certainly suitable for Wikipedia--that the administration simply
ignored.  Given the Patriot Act, it is not such a large leap that the
next time something like this happens, the administration in power
will be more likely to suppress information.
And the nym solution--given "sneak and peak" searches--will be just as
inadequate here as it would be in China.
I fear this invites a far wider discussion than the one we have
already had.  For there are large problems which the current Internet
architecture clearly fails to adequately address--with or without Tor.
Whether you're talking about vandalizing Wikipedia content or spam or
phishing or any of a number of other kinds of abuse.
This discussion has highlighted that anonymity poses a problem.  Most
of us are concerned with preserving it, and for good reason.  And what
is clear is that we need a solution far broader than Tor.
I wish I had some ideas for this solution.  I don't.

There would have to be some kind of inconvenient to obtain key

Except that a good deal of the verbiage on this thread has illustrated
the shortcomings of IP addresses.  You asked how a web server would
distinguish between authenticated and unauthenticated Tor users; your
suggestion would require the Tor server to authenticate users.
The moment you authenticate, you are no longer anonymous.  Hence Tor
no longer serves the purpose for which it is intended.
This is not a technical problem.  What you propose is a fundamental
contradiction.  It is a logic problem which cannot satisfactorily be
addressed at the technical level.
I'm thinking of web cookies.  These are already a well-developed
technology.  They work for all kinds of sites that require
authenticated access.
Now, let's be clear about the anonymity that Wikipedia hopes to
preserve.  In fact, they are claiming that they are blacklisting Tor
(and I presume other anonymous) IP addresses, because anonymous users
vandalize Wikipedia entries.  They say they don't want to identify
users, but the policy of blocking users by IP address assumes that a
user is identified by that IP address.
Therefore, Wikipedia is using IP addresses to identify abusers.  Just
like I blacklist IP addresses of SMTP servers that send me spam.  It
is not be a perfect identification; I *know* that I miss out on
legitimate e-mail.  But it is identification--and therefore, I am
treating no IP address as anonymous.
So if Wikipedia is going to block based on IP address, then they too
must drop the fiction that they are preserving anonymity.  They
aren't.  For either a user can be identified through an IP address or
they are refusing edit access.

Okay, that's interesting.  I still object to blacklisting by IP
address as a form of preserving anonymity for reasons I've stated
elsewhere in this thread, but given that...
Actually, part of the problem here would be just that you would need a
reviewer in a less unfree country.  And it terrifies me to contemplate
that a dissident should need to rely on outsiders.
But since this issue arises, let me play devil's advocate, just for a
moment.  Just long enough to ask about the concept of dissidents
contributing to Wikipedia.  Is this really an issue?  Does Wikipedia
solicit the kind of information that some governments would choose to
suppress?  I think I'm missing a concept here.
And though I'm curious about the answer, let me set the question aside
almost as quickly.  For I assume that Wikipedia is, in this thread, a
poster child, for a problem that involves other sites and services as
well.  Some have mentioned IRC and blog spam.

With statements like this, why are you even here?  This is a statement
that allows no room for negotiation.  You are, in essence, claiming
that Tor servers exist for the sole purpose of aiding and abetting the
defacing of Wikipedia and other mischief.  Therefore, those of us who
host Tor servers are bad people, whether by intent or otherwise.
What it is you don't get is that you have already decided that Tor is
evil.  You do so based on your claim that almost everything you get
through Tor servers is vandalism.  You want us to authenticate users,
in direct contradiction to the entire idea of anonymity.  Therefore,
you would have us emasculate Tor.
And at the same time, you claim to endorse the idea of anonymity, by
1) not authenticating users, while 2) claiming that you *do*
authenticate users.
If you have security problems, then you need to address your security
problems.  Instead, you are asking us to address your security
problems.  And you twist logic to accuse us of sticking our heads in
the sand when it is your authentication model--whether in fact you
actually do authenticate or not--that seems fundamentally
contradictory and fundamentally flawed.
But rather than resolve your own contradiction, you would have us
import it into Tor.  Like I said before, wrong answer.

If you do your own authentication, then you don't need us to do any
authentication.  If you do your own authentication, then you already
have means to block abusers.
Yet you ask us to compromise the anonymity which is the core purpose
of this project.
Your response here is inconsistent.

The concept of anonymity is incompatible with identification and with

Very simple.  You have claimed in response to another of my postings
that you do authenticate users.  Others here say that in effect you do
not.  Not being a Wikipedia contributor, I don't know whether you do
or not.  But your responses to others seem to concur with their claims
that you do not authenticate users.  It seems you are trying to have
it both ways.
You advocate a contradiction as a solution to *your* problem with Tor.
Worse, you want the developers of Tor to import this contradiction
into the operation of Tor.
I sincerely hope you don't have to have ever been a programmer to see
why this is a problem.

Pseudonyms are a separate problem from Tor.  As someone posted, Tor
does not prevent people from using pseudonyms.  If pseudonyms will
solve Wikipedia's problem, then fine; a good portion of this argument
has been about Wikipedia's need for authentication.  See my comments
following your footnote.
Now why couldn't *he* say that?  The man's involved with an
encyclopedia project; he should be able to write.
The way this particular aspect of our disagreement arose is that I
accused him of wanting Tor to do his authentication for him.  He
claimed that Wikipedia does do its own authentication.  Now you
explain that Wikipedia does not *require* authentication.  Which
undermines the usefulness of offering authentication.
You are attempting to compare Tor's security policy to Wikipedia's
security policy.
Tor has a security policy.  Tor's security policy is to protect
originating IP addresses which might be connected to persons.  We
hope, in combination with Privoxy, it protects anonymity
reasonably well.  On the reasonable (I think) premise that other
sites are primarily responsible for their own security, it only
limits some abuse.
Now, what is Wikipedia's security policy?  With no authentication
requirement, and a policy that allows anyone to edit (unless they're
connecting from a blacklisted IP address), I might as well ask, "What
is truth?"
But Tor is about anonymity.  Not about pseudonymity.  Not about other
forms of authentication.  As it should be.

Excellent.  You're absolutely right that there would be implications

I have no reason to object to what you suggest here.

It's true.  They are a little crufty that way.
Indeed.  And that obsolete one will get regenerated every time I

That trick (for future reference) is:

    ./configure
And, yes, it worked.
Silly me, I thought it was using the old libevent I had compiled when
I first embarked on this expedition months ago.  But no.  This is the
really crufty old version OpenBSD includes.
I choose OpenBSD for my router because I really like how they handle
networking.  I like pf and I like how they handle network card
configuration.  I can't figure out how to get FreeBSD to do the same
