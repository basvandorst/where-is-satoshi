@_subject: [tor-talk] Private obfs4 bridge 
I live in Iran and we have so many censorship because of that i use
Tor in Ubuntu.
My Tor version is 2.6.8 and i use Obfs4proxy to use obfs4 bridge.
I was wondering if you`d mind giving me private obfs4 bridge for more speed.
Really thank you ;)
Please help me.I really need a private obfs4 bridge because in Iran we
have a bad censorship.
