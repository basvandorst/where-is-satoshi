Quoting " When using a transparent proxy, it is possible to start a Tor
session from the client as well as from the transparent proxy,
creating a "Tor over Tor" scenario. Doing so produces undefined and
potentially unsafe behavior. In theory, however, you can get six hops
instead of three, but it is not guaranteed that you'll get three
different hops - you could end up with the same hops, maybe in reverse
or mixed order. It is not clear if this is safe. It has never been
You can ?choose an entry/exit point, but you get the best security
that Tor can provide when you leave the route selection to Tor;
overriding the entry / exit nodes can mess up your anonymity in ways
we don't understand. Therefore Tor over Tor usage is highly discouraged.
