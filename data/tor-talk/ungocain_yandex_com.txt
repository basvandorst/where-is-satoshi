I'd like to know as well.  All I could find in trac was this:
    There's no explanation there, but it's possible that this part of the
code in 38 ESR just wasn't given a security-/privacy-conscious review
yet, with other more pressing work in the 5.0 pipeline.
In any case, my many-years-old workaround stays as dependable as ever:
disable js (this goes without saying, really) and disable css.

You left out the part about verifying PGP signatures (!).
You're excused this time because the MAR format allows for (possibly
multiple) signatures and Tor developers do sign their MAR releases.  I
also expect the Tor Browser to fail tightly in case of unsigned/invalid
MAR files.  But for those that already decided what degree of trust to
put where, and are going the manual route anyway, checking a PGP
signature ex ante is in order.

It's problematic, of course, since it requires an expert not only on
programming, networking, privacy and security but also on Mozilla's
extension architecture.  But really, I don't think there's any other

Hi guys.
I posted this as a comment in the blog a few days ago, with no answer so
I've been experimenting with manual incremental updates and noticed that
the "mar-tools-linux64.zip" file in the distribution directory changes
between Tor Browser releases (the executables inside the archive also
I've seen it change at least twice between the two most recent releases.
The signatures were good.
1. Is the source in the tools being updated or is this some artifact
of the build/distribution system?
2. If the source changes, are you guys doing that or are you just
pulling from Mozilla?
3. Is there a changelog anywhere?

As stated, that conclusion is wrong.  In general, 1 cookie != 1 domain.  A

That build corresponds to a branch which includes the commit that

Seems so.  You will still be prompted to update through the MAR system,
but it won't happen automatically.

He means onion MTAs directly communicating in order to deliver the message to
its destination:
https:// en.wikipedia .org/wiki/Mail_transfer_agent
https:// tools.ietf .org/html/rfc5321
https:// tools.ietf .org/html/rfc5321
The implicit promise is that if the message originates from and is destined to
an onion address, it never leaves the Tor network.
He means "OnionMail": http:// en.onionmail .info/directory.html
They are mail servers running behind onion services. Not necessarily "web".

Hi, I like your idea but have some criticism to make regarding what you
consider users of the Tor network.
Why can't people separate Tor from Tor Browser in their minds?  Tor is a
network transport.  Not all Tor users are lusers sitting behind Tor Browser,
clicking things.
For example I have a system-wide Tor daemon, and I use it for a variety of
different non-interactive things, like news reader updates, automatic source
code fetches, web-api-related requests, and other cronjobs.  I am not the only
one.  Shitflare also affects completely reasonable automatic non-interactive
uses like that.
In fact the Great Firewall of Shitflare completely fucks every hope of
composability of their clients' web sites.
No.  Javascript in the browsers is shit. Shit for security, shit for privacy.
I consider requiring Javascript for fundamental functionality an affront.
Ditto about Tor vs. Tor Browser.  Though a neutral _protocol_ (a remote API)
to request and submit the PoW could be workable.
Ditto, Tor != Tor Browser.

Your IP should never be visible there.
Is /what/ by design?
All communication should be tunnelled through the local tor daemon.  It
should not matter whether you click "Test tor network settings" or not.
It should not matter whether you see anything in Torbutton circuit
display or not. Both of these are merely informational.
You can check for yourself using a network sniffer like tcpdump.

@_subject: [tor-talk] augmented browsing - "sed inside torbrowser" 
Using sed/awk/etc. for website transformation sounds very silly.  Your
scripts will turn completely unwieldy as soon as you try to do something
You can do much more, much easier by using your own self-served javascript.
And you don't need to install extra addons like Greasemonkey for that
(people just shouldn't install anything on top of Tor Browser, unless they
are competent programmers and have audited the code).  Nor enabling
javascript for the website itself.  All you need is already conveniently
packaged in Tor Browser: NoScript.
Learn about NoScript surrogates.
Note: NoScript surrogates are not equivalent Greasemonkey scripts,
Warning: You have to think carefully about the sort of transformations you
make and in what context you make them.  Because they could be used to
fingerprint you.
PS: Talking about code audits: How many of you have looked at NoScript's
source?  I have.  I was happier prior.
