@_subject: [tor-talk] Torbutton and Firefox 16.x.x.Incompatible. 
When I install Torbutton on Firefox 16.x.x series Firefox no more starts.It seems both are completely incompatible.With the 15.x.x series no problem.Yes,I know I should probably be using the Tor Browser Bundle,but,I do things the old way.I prefer to compile from source and configure everything manually.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How do I know the number of Tor users nearby? 
Imagine that I live in a country with heavy political surveillance(which is not the case) and I am one of a couple of users of Tor there.I'm probably at risk.So,how do I know if I am THE ONE in the middle of a desert,or I am surrounded by a big crowd of Tor users.Is there a way to know that?By country,city etc.?We can easily know,for example,the number of relays running in a country,can that be translated to total number of users-running relays or not-?Is there any public statistics of Tor users worldwide,by country,city etc?  Thanks.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor SSL traffic, VPN SSL traffic etc., 
Can network sniffers,traffic analyzers etc. see enough differences to determine that,this is Tor SSL traffic,or this is VPN SSL traffic,for example?It would be interesting to have on  site a graphical explanation of what Tor packet format is,layers of encryption in it(I remember,for example,the book TCP/IP Illustrated for all the TCP/IP protocols),including packet format changes for the new obfsproxy "translation" software.The tor website does have that graphics for how the tor network operates,a more low level explanation would be good reading.Or,is there any place where we can already find something like that.Thanks.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Bundle and Local GeoIP Database.Configure. 
When I put in the Vidalia's configure file(Tor Browser Bundle):
to use a local GeoIP database,that does not work.The view the network map in Vidalia does not show anything(green lines to show active relay paths/circuits,and not active circuits).When the above 2 lines are not in vidalia.conf all works normally.So,how can I configure theTor Browser Bundle to use a local GeoIP database? Thanks.

@_subject: [tor-talk] HTML5 video and Tor anonymity. 
Using Tor(TBB default configuration,plugins disabled) I can see videos.I suppose that it is HTML5 videos,so,isn't the same that flash videos? and can the anonymity be compromised?
More,by default,TBB accepts JavaScript running.So,I suppose JavaScript is not a great danger for Tor anonymity.Is that right? Or,should I take any additional precaution?

@_subject: [tor-talk] What is the meaning of the following in tcpdump files? 
Analysing a tcpdump file of a Tor only connection(with Wireshark) a lot of times I get (EXTRACT) :
298517    2174.409794    "Destination IP"    192.168.1.64    TCP    etlservicemgr > 44861 [ACK] Seq=272869289 Ack=9508575 Win=501 Len=1440[Packet size limited during capture]
298518    2174.410803    "Destination IP"    192.168.1.64    TCP    etlservicemgr > 44861 [ACK] Seq=272870729 Ack=9508575 Win=501 Len=1440[Packet size limited during capture]
298519    2174.411750    192.168.1.64    "Destination IP"    TCP    44861 > etlservicemgr [ACK] Seq=9508575 Ack=272872169 Win=994 Len=0[Packet size limited during capture]
Other times instead of: "...etlservicemgr...",I get "...https...",or "...SSH...".I guess it is related to the entry node I use.So,is this "...etlservicemgr..." a connection really encrypted? Or is there any form for an entry node "FORCE" a non-encrypted connection?
