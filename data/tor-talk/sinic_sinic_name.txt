Similar ideas came up in the past. Last year I've implemented something
along those lines as part of my Bachelor's thesis, but I wasn't fully
satisfied with the results. Still, maybe my work is useful to you or
someone else: The most interesting part for you is probably chapter 2, the analysis.

No, it's end-to-proxy for the regular Internet (where exit nodes may be
able to see your traffic) and end-to-end for hidden services.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Problems? Verifying signatures in Tor 4.0.4 
Note that calling gpg --verify with a detached signature as its only
argument is insecure (later versions of GnuPG should emit a warning).
See my message to Gnupg-users and subsequent responses for details:

Yes, the .asc file that Nicolas was talking about is the one an attacker
would distribute alongside a manipulated .tar.xz file. Your .asc file is
fine, so GnuPG sounds the alarm if someone messed with the archive.
An attacker, however, could easily fool GnuPG with a file inline-signed
by the Tor Browser Developers. Using, e.g., sha256sums.incrementals.txt
and the respective detached signature sha256sums.incrementals.txt.asc
(both available at  an
attacker first creates a signed file with an arbitrary key:
The newly created signature packet gets thrown away:
And the signature of the Tor Browser Developers takes its place:
GnuPG now won't even take a look at the .tar.xz archive when called with
that .asc file as its only argument, but still reports a good signature.
I've attached the file for you to try it out.
Specify both the detached signature and the archive you want to verify.
