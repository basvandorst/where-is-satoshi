@_subject: [tor-talk] Blocking event in Kazakhstan, October 2014? 
Hash: SHA1
Excellent find. No major events that would explain a blocking event
occurred in Kazakhstan judging from a quick Google search. I guess
they simply felt that their censorship systems needed an upgrade,
after having upgraded to deep packet inspection back in December 2011
due to unrest.
