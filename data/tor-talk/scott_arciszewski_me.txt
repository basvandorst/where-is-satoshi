I'm using the latest version of the Tor Browser Bundle. It gives me this
prompt: ^- possibly related

Any time an option comes up that I don't want to think about, I immediately
deny it. Better safe than sorry.

Heh. I failed to learn anything of value from that article. Where do
people think non-profits get the majority of their funding; well
wishes, kitten giggles, and unicorn farts?
I've talked to a few people who pointed at this and the Black Hat
fiasco and promptly went full tinfoil-wrapped potato. It's stupid.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Giving Hidden Services some love 
Trigger warning: This entire reply is going to be shameless (though
non-profit) self-promotion.
The current state of diversity in Onion Land is disappointing. So many of
the sites still online emphasize things like drugs, porn, and hacking. I
think everyone would benefit from a wider swath of the population getting
involved in hosting hidden services.
Consequently, I'm specing out a FLOSS desktop self-publishing software
using node-webkit and Tor (set up to use Hidden Services).
Some of the ideas I have already include:
* Simple integration with an Onionimbus provider.
* Namecoin integration
If anyone's interested, I'll set up a repo in the AM.
