@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor exit node IPv6 
So, does this mean that when I run Tor v0.2.3.22-rc
(git-213ba1a70b41ea97) with dualstack (both v4 and v6) in bridge mode
(twice the ORPort argument), both the v4 and v6 addresses are
submitted to the directory authorities? And does this mean that they
will both be presented at  ?
