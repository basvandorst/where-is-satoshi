@_subject: [tor-talk] tor and apache 
I am running a tor relay on my desktop (Ubuntu 14.04) as well as using tor browser to access the internet myself. I would also like to host a web site
using apache on the same computer. Are there any risks in doing this? the relay or my web browsing be compromised? There was some information tor.stackexchange.com indicating that running a relay
on the same computer as a tor browser does not increase the risk and may
possibly be beneficial though there is some uncertainty. However, I haven't been
able to find anything relating to running apache and a relay on the same
computer. Does anyone have information about this?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Blocking of Tor relay IP address 
I having been running a Tor relay for a while now and have met the following problem. It seems that if you run a Tor relay for long enough your IP address ends up in blocklists maintained by various services. One of these services is Akamai and Apple seems to be using Akamai services. As a result I lost access to Apple sites such as discussions.apple.com and support.apple.com even when not using Tor. The problem disappeared when I asked my ISP to change my IP address. I would like to continue running a Tor relay but I would also like to be able to access apple sites from the same IP address. Does anyone have any information or suggestions relating to this situation?

Thanks for your reply Allen. I should have mentioned in my post that I am not running an exit relay. I have
ExitPolicy reject *:*
in torrc.

Thanks leon. I don't have an exit relay. However I am interested in know how you manage the ip's reputation online.
