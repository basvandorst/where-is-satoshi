I'm a bit of a newb at this (all of it). But this email thread (tor-talk)
is completely unencrypted, right? And it has to be that way?

Can you provide proof of this?"
The articles I've been reading about the NSA breaking encryption have
suggested that 1024bit encryption may be totally compromised, or
ineffective... but proof is hard to come by.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Spoiled Onions 
I have a basic question about the Spoiled Onions report. The bad onions
mean that someone could block traffic, could re-direct traffic, or
otherwise censor content, but they couldn't de-anonymize users nor could
they prevent user from re-connecting to Tor network with different nodes.
Do I understand the story? If so, am I correct?
