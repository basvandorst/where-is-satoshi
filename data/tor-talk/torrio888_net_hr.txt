People always whine how Tor is slow but when I do a speed test over Tor I get amazing speeds comparable with my actual internet connection, how accurate are this results?

I used this instructions for preventing flash from circumventing Tor Browser's proxy settings.

 Speedtest.net uses Adobe Flashplayer to run its test so i am not sure
 how you got TorBrowser to run it.  Their beta speed test might work.
 Bandwidthplace.com has an HTML5 speed tester that seems to go via Tor.
 It works after you temporarily allow all on the site in NoScript, and
 say no to the canvas prompt.

 Don't know how bandwidthplace does their "ping" test either.

They could employ a bunch of people whose job would be to  go to  request bridges, solve captchas and add bridges to the block list and request bridges over gmail.
I asked this question before and the answer was something along the lines that there is a limit of how much and what bridges are given to users based on their IP address and geolocation but that is not the answer because  they could give this people totally uncensored access to the internet  so that they can use VPNs and Tor itself to circumvent this limitation.

 Terrific information. I am informing the Italian community
 about this development:
   and placing a plug for yawning's cfc add-on to protect Tor
 users from Cloudflare abuse. That add-on actually needs a
 bit more love as it currently breaks sites that do not use
 Cloudflare directly but only include an image or such.
 Also, Torbrowser should ship with it directly.

I have read the proposal for non hidden .onion services for sites that don't need anonymity but want to use Tor's end to end encryption and authentication, for  example Facebook. Could the same be done for people that are more interested in censorship circumvention then in anonymity to decrease latency and conserve bandwidth  so  instead of building 3 hop circuits they could build 2 hop circuits? entry node---> exit node ---> website
