Sure. You can report that you have a window size of 0x0 if you want. Or
42x23 or 1234x567. But the problem is a) that you want to be in a group
of users with the same window size AND b) that there is no means to get
(further) information on what your actual window size is. Reporting
"whatever size you tell it" is not appropriate to achieve these two
related goals. It turns out that especially b) is quite hard if you do
not report the actual window size.

Hartmut Haase:
Okay, if you make a screenshot of the browser window and this gives you
different results for the height and width of whole window this may be
the result of having different toolbar, url bar and button sizes etc.
which is influenced, in part, by your underlying operating system. So,
this is nothing to worry about as long as the values web pages may
retrieve are rounded to multiples of 200 (width) and 100 (height) which
the inner window (i.e. the window only containing the rendered website)
is set to on start-up. Tor Browser reports those values even if for your
browser window (i.e. the window with the website and the toolbar, url
bar etc.)/screen size.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Merging all languages (locales) into one Tor Browser 
David Bala?ic:
I am not convinced by this argument. First, if you have 5 million users
then 3 million is a majority, too, which would still leave 2 million to
teach themselves how to switch to the desired locale. You might argue
"Well, it would be much much less than 2 million people that would be
affected." Maybe, who knows.
But even then the first thing you'll get as support is users asking
"Where do I get the [language of your choice] Tor Browser" as they
landed on the english Tor project landing page and assume they get the
english browser if they can't switch to the language they want (as
Mozilla e.g. offers (see:  ),
which they don't want.
If you somehow avoided/managed that you need to take care of the people
that really want to use another language or you ask all on first start
which would be the second hurdle users have to take to get Tor Browser
running. And you need that for all supported OSes propably with
screenshots explaining things.
Then you need to take care of a fraction of them that activated a
language (e.g. Chinese) you ship by accident and are now completely lost
as they are not able to parse, e.g. Chinese and thus to get back the
language they want.
So, in short: I am quite concerned about the usability issues (and I
probably missed a bunch) that would follow from having all locales in
one bundle.
But there is hope for you: We plan to have a hardened/alpha series which
contains all the locales already in it. See:

Each tab is its own Tor circuit
Is this due to the 100-Foot overview nature (maybe it looks that way
from 100 feet above :) )? The thing is that not the tab is the important
isolation criterion but the base domain of the URL you have in your
location bar. Thus, requests to blog.torproject.org and
trac.torproject.org in different tabs go over the same circuit (let's
ignore some corner cases like circuit timeouts etc.). And then there is
the catch-all circuit for requests not associated with a window/tab at
all... and all the things we have not fixed yet. Oh well...

Nice. I have not heard someone trying to do that before.
Not sure what you mean with "works" but starting it this way will create

needed for Tor Browser (like Torbutton and HTTPS-Everywhere etc.) and
without tor and pluggable transports.
Commit bc305e697edb6860fe035e4b67fc5f027de237a5 in Tor Browser needs
this entity and Torbutton defines it. This is, again, a sign that you
are missing the extensions we ship in Tor Browser.

Yes, this is bug 19890 and it should be fixed on Mozilla's side right
now (I tested it a while ago): having a clean Tor Browser you won't get
that warning anymore. To quote from the blog post update:
Update (August 11, 10:04 UTC): Starting from a couple of hours ago Tor
Browser users might see a notification box in their browser claiming
that Firefox is too old providing a button to get a newer one. This is
both due to a server-side code change on Mozilla's side and an oversight
by us during the ESR45 transition. Clicking on the "Get Firefox" button
is save and leads the user to our Tor Browser download page. Needless to
say, this whole behavior is highly confusing and we are apologizing for
it. We are working on a fix as past as possible and hope to get Mozilla
to exempt Tor Browser users from this feature while we are working on a
new release. For technical details see our bug tracker.
We plan to release a new Tor Browser version shortly to address the
issue from our side. As a workaround one can either install a new Tor
Browser 6.0.3 version from our website or set
`extensions.systemAddon.update.url` to `""` which should get rid of the
out-of-date-extension the next time an extension update check gets
performed. Again, we are sorry for the inconvenience.

Hi Theresa,

Thanks! Let us know what you learn and where you think are (additional)

Yes. The problem is that the cookie protection dialog is not working in
private browsing mode due to an underlying bug in Firefox.[1] So, we
disabled that feature in that mode in Tor Browser as users got confused
by it.[2]
If that's the case then this is a bug. Providing a New Identity should
not be bound to the user being in Tor Browser's default mode or allowing
disk records for whatever reason.

The problem you are seeing is due to a preference governed by the slider

Or do you have changed settings in Tor Browser yourself that could cause
Restoring the default settings is not changing anything visible on the
privacy pane, you are right, but it does adjust important settings both
in the browser and NoScript.
A safe thing to do would be downloading a clean, new Tor Browser from
our website and start over again (mabye exporting the bookmarks from the
currently used Tor Browser and importing them in the newly downloaded one).

@_subject: [tor-talk] noscript 10.2 default mandatory sites, trusted sites 
No worries, Tor Browser does not trust those sites. I think your
confusion above stems for a misunderstanding: we use NoScript for a very
specific purpose, which is for helping us with our Security Slider,
while its default use in any other browser, say Firefox, is a quite
different one (giving you protections against scripts running etc.).
So, with that in mind looking at the NoScript source alone for
interfering what it does in Tor Browser is not sufficient. You need at
least to look at our code controlling NoScript as well.[1]
Re: the permissions, yes, that's again because NoScript serves a
distinct purpose in Tor Browser (which is different from its default
usage in other browsers).
That's fixed in our alpha releases, provided you flip a preference.[2]
We plan to backport that fix, probably to the next stable, but won't
make it easier to mess with NoScript's settings as the risk to shoot
oneself in the foot by tweaking/"tuning" NoScript is pretty high.

CarlSpackler at getbackinthe.kitchen:
I think I agree with the general idea and that it would be a benefit to
have some kind of differntiation between "bridge is working right now"
and "bridge is not working right now".
However, I wonder how we (say Tor Browser) should measure that safely
and make sure that it is actually the bridge that is down (maybe there
was just an upstream issue at that time). Or do you mean the latter does
not really matter to users anyway and as long as bridges are not
reachable for whatever reason they should be treated as down? Moreover,
once bridges are marked as down I am not convinced yet we should just
discard them. Bridges are scarce and it might be just a short time the
bridge was/is actually not reachable/down.
An other option could be to incorporate external measurement data but
that comes with the price of enhanced complexity making sure that all
users have up-to-date data about bridge reachability readily available.
And even that is error-prone because even though that external
measurement might indidicate a bridge is down/up that might not match
the experience an individual user has.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser disabled NoScript, but can't update 
Roman Mamedov:
I think we should differentiate a bit here. Of course, Tor Browser
relies on that as we support installing extensions as long as they are
signed by Mozilla. It's a fair point, though, saying the extensions we
ship as essential Tor Browser extensions should be resistent to Mozilla
PKI failures or we should fall back to safer defaults or... We have some
options here which we will discuss in the near future and then we'll
implement those we deem worthwhile.
I think that's not adequately describing the situation we were in.
Mozilla did not suddenly remotely disable Tor anonymity protections at
their whim. What happened was that Tor Browser users on higher security
levels got suddenly essentially the same experience as any Tor Browser
user that is using Tor Browser as we ship it. This is definitely a
serious bug, I agree. However that did not happen by pressing some
button remotely as the certificate you had *locally* in your browser
You could argue that Mozilla could just sign any exension and ship that
one as an "update" to NoScript and Tor Browser would happily install it.
Yes, this possibility exists and we will revisit that screnario (see
above). However, there are no known ways that Mozilla can induce a Tor
bypass be it remotely or by installing an extension into Tor Browser (or
by failing to monitor expiration dates of certificates) (if I am wrong
here, please let us know). I think that should be kept in mind as well
when talking about the scope of the problem at hand.
Finally, if you look at the amount of code we inherit from Firefox (way
more than 99%) then there is plenty of room where things can go wrong
(for a bunch of "wrong"s), so even if we avoid the NoScript problem in
the future (which we should), we are pretty dependent on Mozilla.
