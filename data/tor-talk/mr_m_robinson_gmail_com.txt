@_subject: [tor-talk] No BetterPrivacy for Tor? 
I updated Tor and was adding few addons, out of habit I went to
the BetterPrivacy add-on page and got this message
so tried again
So, is this a Tor thing or is Mozilla selectively blocking add-ons by
country of origin? If I don't use Tor this add-on is available.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why can't I hide/minimize to tray anymore? 
Windows 7 65-bit
It's not Ticket  (new defect)
Everything is fine, but PMW (Process Manager for Windows) cannot affect
the Tor Window anymore.
I'm trying to hide/minimize the aurora window to the tray. this hasn't
been a problem in past versions, but now NONE of these type (PMW, DM2,
etc) apps will affect the tor/browser window. I Prefer PMW for the quick

@_subject: [tor-talk] TB for Win 
I've run both at the same time for years with accidentally using the
wrong browser. Except for the Scrapbook add-on I leave the Tor-Firefox
stock, and I also use Process Manager for Windows to 'hide' Tor-Firefox
when I'm not using it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How does the new browser know where to find old 
I just upgraded the Tor bundle, I unzipped it into a different
folder than the last bundle, but when I tried to import old bookmarks it
opened to the location of the previous version's exported bookmarks,
which were not saved in a default location. How does the new browser
remember where the old browser saved the bookmarks?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Scroogle is No More? 
I've tried DuckduckGo, It isn't for heavy engine users. It seems like a
childrens search engine, and it has a lousy results format format.
I don't understand how Ixquick/Startpage can tap Google, yet Google goes
out of its way to crush Scroogle, which was by far the best out of what
I've found and checked on this thread.
I must be getting old, YaCy and Seeks can not replace Scroogle on its
worse day.  My browser clears everything (cookies, flash) when it shuts
down. Why would I want to tie into any of these?
Clusty/Yippy fell to the dark side, after being bought they adopted a
disturbing censorship policy.
For a heave engine user, Scroogle is hard to replace, none of these is
getting it done like Scroogle; Ixquick, maybe, with a bit of
Greasemonkey, but I don't like the fact that they have Google access via
two sites while Scroogle is being forced off the net for virtually doing
the same thing.

Which download helper are you using?
Thanks for the Bloody Vikings, I've never heard of it.
No one ever uses OpenBSD for live security disks...

Your mother/grandmother,
cheapskate notion, last night, of not paying David Glass to tame/clean

to pay David, she sure isn't going to pay the guy that was supposed to
clean the basement.
