Most consumer-oriented cable modems and routers don't have this sort of
capability. If the goal is to restrict tor servers to only those people
with big pipes or expensive, professional-quality gear, then that's one
thing. But if the point is to encourage wider adoption, then solving the
problem with CPE equipment is not the way to go.
A very unstable solution could be to run tor under trickled, but this
creates its own problems. Firstly, trickled can be unstable with some
apps, and (at least on my system) will often die unexpectedly. Secondly,
you'd still be advertising this fat(ter) pipe, but rate-limiting it
below what's being advertised. This is probably Not A Good Thing (tm).
As for expecting the average tor user to modify source code, that seems
pretty unrealistic. Not everyone running tor is a programmer, and it
would seem to me that requiring users to recompile like that doesn't
solve the larger issue.

@_subject: More problems with tor startup 
I'm still seeing errors like this:
    Apr 23 19:37:34.250 [warn] Your server (24.182.53.20:9001) has not
    managed to confirm that its ORPort is reachable. Please check your
    firewalls, ports, address, etc.
despite the fact that the port *is* clearly reachable from outside, and
tor seems to be connecting properly--at least from a client perspective.
What is this message really telling me?

Descriptors are essentially file handles. You'd need to ask your virtual
server administrator how many are allocated to your instance. If you
have more than 1024, then I don't see why you couldn't run Tor, but

This isn't entirely fair. Some virtual hosting providers are pretty
responsive, while others aren't. Just like anything else in life, YMMV.
If your hosting provider is selling you X GB of tranfer a month, most of
the good ones don't care what you do with it as long as it isn't illegal
or likely to cause them abuse complaints.
Then again, there are plenty of virtual hosting providers who really
only want you to run a mail or web server so they can drastically
oversell their bandwidth. Check your broadband company's "contract"
(which is usually just abusive ToS in most cases, IMHO) and you'll see
where the hosting providers get their ideas.
If you want to run a Tor server off a virtual host, shop around. I'm
pretty sure you'll be able to find a company that will allow it. I know
I've used virtual servers in the past where the operators were more than
happy to make modifications to suit my legitimate needs; maybe they'll
do the same for you.

@_subject: Wiki about usage of vservers still up to date? / What are 
Tor can be niced to reduce load on the CPU. Also, some virtual machines
such as Xen, OpenVZ, and some of the Solaris 10 features allow you to
set resource limits per virtual server to avoid resource contention.
I used to use a Virtuozzo vserver for security audits, and the operators
were able to set it up to give me full burstable access to the CPU while
still ensuring that other vservers weren't resource-starved.
I would imagine that Tor, niced properly, with a reduced MaxConn
setting, and properly rate-limited wouldn't be abusive on a
properly-configured virtua,l server. But again, YMMV.

@_subject: Weird behavior of my server 
True, although I've been able to have some limited success by reducing
MaxConn as well.
AFAICT, this isn't really how Tor works. Maybe the developers will chime
in, but speed has a lot more to do with latency between nodes and
bandwidth consumption on the exit servers than anything else.
Last I checked, there were only about 35 exit servers in the network. No
matter how many middleman routers there are, all that traffic still gets
funnelled through the same exit servers, so while there's a net gain in
*privacy* by distributing the load among more middlemen, there's no net
gain in traffic speed.

@_subject: Lower minimum bandwidth? 
I'm running tor 0.1.0.17-1 as a server on a 256K/3MB asymmetric link,
and am a little frustrated that I can't rate-limit less than 20KB/sec.
Since the upload speed of such a link is fully saturated at ~25KB/sec,
it would be nice to be able to offer a smaller percentage of the link to
tor users (e.g. 10-15KB/sec).
One of the Wiki questions was how to improve adoption rates for tor
servers. It seems like tor might be better served offering more servers
with lower bandwidth rather than fewer servers at higher rates, but
that's just my $0.02.
Even if tor doesn't offer better upstream rate-limiting (incoming is
currently the only rate-limiting supported), I really think the servers
shouldn't refuse to start just because BandwidthRate < 20KB. There are
*many* interactive services (telnet and ssh, for example) that could
perform quite well even at lower rates, and allowing server operators to
offer them might increase the uptake of exit servers as well.
Is there a technical reason why lower rates aren't supported? And is
there anything else I can do other than adding "MaxAdvertisedBandwidth
10 KB" to my torrc?

@_subject: Problems with restarting tor 
I'm running tor 0.1.0.17-1 on Debian. If I send a HUP, or even restart
the tor server, I get lots of the following:
    Apr 23 13:38:15.869 [notice] Tried for 60 seconds to get a
    connection to [scrubbed]:9030. Giving up.
I've even tried "rm -rf /var/lib/tor" before rebooting to see if
something is wedged in the stored files, but the only thing that really
seems to help is a system reboot.
Have other people had the same problem, or am I missing something
