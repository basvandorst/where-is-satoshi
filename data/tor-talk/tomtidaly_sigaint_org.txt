@_subject: [tor-talk] wget - secure? 
I asked a question asked about this issue on the wget mailing list this
week and a patch was provided by Tim Ruehsen. If you have time it would be
great if you read the mailing list discussion to see if I got the issue
correct, and if your happy with the patch.
