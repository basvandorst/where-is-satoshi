@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Question - Not saving settings 
A question for you:
Because cookies were being saved and not deleted with the default settings
of "never remember history" I changed the setting to custom and then
unchecked the accept cookies from site option.
I then proceeded to set the sites I wanted to accept cookies from manually.
So far so good, however when I close out of the browser it does not save
these settings. I assume it has something to do with a file that is set at
read only or a directory that is not allowing a new file to be written. I
poked around a bit but didn't see any file that was obviously the one and I
didn't want to globally disable read-write in the profile directory.
What is my next step?
Thank you.
