Using Tor via Telex  (added 7/20/11)
Normally, the Telex station is able to see the destination of your proxied requests
(e.g., the ?Blocked.com? that you request via Telex). However, it is possible to use
Tor, an anonymity-providing
proxy, on top of Telex. This way, the Telex station will only be able to observe that
you are using Tor, not your ultimate destination.
To use Telex as an entry to Tor, first make sure you've downloaded the Telex client
below. You'll also need our Tor public key file, which instructs the Telex station that you want to be connected to our Tor Bridge instead of our HTTP
proxy. To use this public key, run the Telex client with the additional options shown in bold:
telex-client -k tor.pubkey -p 4444 notblocked.telex.cc
Next, download the Tor Browser Bundle
client (if you don't already have the most recent version), and edit your torrc file
to add the following three lines:
Bridge 127.0.0.1:4444 F580401C7A5EEDD54F2927A1C161E9642D1ADCCC
UpdateBridgesFromAuthority 0
UseBridges 1
At this point, launch the tor_browser_bundle, and a browser window should
open using Tor over Telex. You can use this page to verify that you are connecting through Tor.
i thing this is a good idea instead to use bridges to connect to tor....
Is it like that or what?????

how come a software or tools as Telex and is not anonymity??????
because the most of blocked sites by the governments are restricted also and censored...
so  i dont think a software like Telex can work against these governments cause no body is ready to loose his freedom....

thx for ur answer but still i need help in how to fix my exitnode????
    Simply edit the torrc while both Tor and Vidalia are closed. Vidalia
    edits the torrc file when changes are made using its interface; upon
    starting up, however, I believe it gathers its parameters directly
    from the torrc. In my experience when I write a custom torrc with
    Tor and Vidalia closed, and then start Vidalia (which in turns
    starts Tor), my custom torrc is overwritten, but upon careful
    observation of the new file, it can be seen that each of my settings
    remains the same, although reordered and with added header comments.
    I do wish there was a "do not edit torrc" or "confirm before editing
    torrc" option in Vidalia, but generally the changes it makes are
    harmless. C'est la vie.

However, my experience has been that such services do not work properly with Tor.  I'm not sure why but either I cannot complete the login process or my "buddies" do not appear or suchlike.  All I am trying to do is to login with a Hotmail or Yahoo address then add people, chat, etc.
I realize that I can download Pidgin and suchlike and use them with Tor but (for now at least) I would like to see if I can get web-based chat to work.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Creating Custom Circuits 
i was reading about Creating Custom Circuits..
and i found these orders ..but i didnt know how to use them and where to write them..???
Using Tor control protocol you can create custom circuits of different sizes. Regardless of circuit size the last node must be configured as exit-node. In order to successfully create and use custom circuits we must first disable Tor's automatic circuit creation mechanism. While it can not be completely disabled (?), we can still use the following configuration options to force Tor clients to use our custom made circuits:
setconf __DisablePredictedCircuits=1      <- disable preemptively creating circuits
setconf MaxOnionsPending=0                <- maximum circuits pending
setconf newcircuitperiod=999999999        <- longer period before creating new circuit
setconf maxcircuitdirtiness=999999999     <- longer period for circuit expiration
You can delete already created circuits so they don't interfere:
closecircuit 2
250 OK
closecircuit 1
250 OK
getinfo circuit-status
250 OK
can somebody help me and give a example to how an where set these orders???

"DNS: couldn't open /etc/resolv.conf: No such file or directory
Disabling disk cache: No such file or directory
Disabling local tree: No such file or directory
Established listening socket on port 8123."
My OS is WINXP,SP3,
should i configure anything manually in TOR "settings"?
and i'm confused, what's Polipo,TOR, Vidalia ?
Hi all,
Just downloaded and installed TOR, when visiting an URL, i get this error message : "514 Authentication required."
I don't use any proxy server for connecting to Internet,
your help would be greatly appreciated,
"A" URL, or any / many URLs?
If many, make sure settings in Polipo are correct  - & Polipo is running.  Also, if using Firefox, d/l latest Torbutton alpha ver from Tor Project site.  It will set the Tor proxy settings correctly in FX.
If using IE... don't.  Seriously, you can configure IE to work, but using Firefox is safer.  Or, just d/ l the Tor Browser bundle, w/ pre config'd Firefox included.
Can install it to a separate folder than other Fx installs.  to be able to run  a 2nd instance of Fx, create a separate profile for the Tor Browser.  Then in Properties of desktop icon, in the Target box, after the executable file, add the profile name & no remote command:   \firefox.exe" -p fx-shrd-7-22-10 -no-remote

i used Vidalia, now i did run Tor Browser...it works!!,
also in Tor Browser port changed from 9051 to 8118.
r u using vidalia or Tor Browser bundle???
Thanks for your reply ,
I use both FireFox and IE, same problem on both, and with TOR i can't surf anywhere.
here's output after running Polipo:
"DNS: couldn't open /etc/resolv.conf: No such file or directory
Disabling disk cache: No such file or directory
Disabling local tree: No such file or directory
Established listening socket on port 8123."
My OS is WINXP,SP3,
should i configure anything manually in TOR "settings"?
and i'm confused, what's Polipo,TOR, Vidalia ?
Hi all,
Just downloaded and installed TOR, when visiting an URL, i get this error message : "514 Authentication required."
I don't use any proxy server for connecting to Internet,
your help would be greatly appreciated,
"A" URL, or any / many URLs?
If many, make sure settings in Polipo are correct  - & Polipo is running.  Also, if using Firefox, d/l latest Torbutton alpha ver from Tor Project site.  It will set the Tor proxy settings correctly in FX.
If using IE... don't.  Seriously, you can configure IE to work, but using Firefox is safer.  Or, just d/ l the Tor Browser bundle, w/ pre config'd Firefox included.
Can install it to a separate folder than other Fx installs.  to be able to run  a 2nd instance of Fx, create a separate profile for the Tor Browser.  Then in Properties of desktop icon, in the Target box, after the executable file, add the profile name & no remote command:   \firefox.exe" -p fx-shrd-7-22-10 -no-remote

@_subject: [tor-talk] New Browser Bundle 
yes u r right ..
Java Script an cookies should be disabled....
but why there r not in this version this is the question should been answered????
noticed that the new, very latest browser bundle for windows
has Java Script enabled, cookies enabled and NoScript
changed settings back to "enable globally"  considered "dangerous"!
Any reason for this? Even after I unchecked "enable globally" I started to surf
and then noticed a different icon on the top of the window of Aurora where it
now shows an icon for 'Tor enabled" and 'NoScript'.
When I went back into NoScript Preferences, that's when I found "enable globally" - dangerous -
checked again||||||||//////////??????................*  flat on my face_________________ (..)
I guess I really don't understand this NoScript. It shows one icon that supposedly "protects me",
but that icon is nowhere to be found in the preferences panel/window. Why not? It has always
seemed very confusing and misleading to me and why it changes settings that I haven't changed
I do not know.  I am not tech savvy, computer gravy or hair wavy.  But now I must learn.
A little help please on how or where to go, to understand NoScript. Maybe I would be better off
just disabling it altogether? Hmmmm?
Again though, aren't Java Script and cookies supposed to be disabled for Tor to work at its best
in creating anonymity? I don't know how to tweak it like you'all do and I stopped doing substances
many years ago. You know? Not playing 'hide 'n go tweak' any longer.
Takes 3 months for a book on Terminal to reach me and there's still a month and a half to go!
Tanks!   Advance!   In!

how to download this software???
i tried to download it from the site but nothing is downloading????
You should be able to download from Youtube over Tor using youtube-dl
and polipo. Bear in mind that it might be very slow, and using large
amounts of relay bandwidth if you don't have to could be considered

hello friends...
I was reading about Node Guards here :
SO Entry Guards can limit or stop the attacker from the document above...
But i still have some inquires:
how to get the entry guards???
and  to set an entry guard does it mean to use always the same entry node each time i want to connect to ToR????

if u make a look here : u will see some nodes are mentioned as Guard and some not...
so i am talking about those Guard ones to making them as entry nodes...
