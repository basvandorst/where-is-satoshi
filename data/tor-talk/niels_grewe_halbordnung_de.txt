Well, the British government passed a law last year threatening 5  years of jail if you do not disclose your keys/passphrases to unlock  these [0]. One could argue that by "forgetting" your passphrase you  actually fail to disclose it. On the other hand an US court recently  ruled that your password acually is protected by the 5th amendment  [1], but I believe the US govt is challenging this decision. Anyways

@_subject: Default ORPort 443 [was: Re: German data rentention law] 
Besides, opening ports < 1024 usually requires root-privileges,
which could introduce serious security issues if an exploitable
flaw were found in Tor. You can still advertise port 443 as your
ORPort and listen on 9001, but this requires some port-forwarding
magic, which is not entirely feasible for a default
configuration. (But your other reason is sound as well)
just my 2c

@_subject: Internet censorship in Germany is now official 
At least not directly, but their operators could be more prone to be  implicated in some police investigation, because an exit-node IP may  repeatedly appear in the log files of the pages where blocked requests  will be redirected to.
Still, saying that censorship is now "official" might be a bit of a  exaggeration. There is now an offical initiative by the government,  the bill has still to be passed by the parliament.
