@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor browser won't become the standard one... 
I just entered the Tor-community and can?t set the Tor-browser
as standard. I tried it by using the settings within the browser and also
with the Windows(10) function to assign certain apps to browse or whatever.
In the list provided by W10 are only Chrome(which I normally use), IE and Edge.
I noticed that your browser is recognized as Firefox by Google. Can there be a
conflict? Must I install Firefox to get it in that list?
Thanks in advance for any reply.

Hey Wim,
Did you tried selecting TBBs firefox.exe manually via 'Open with' while right-clicking an html file?
Works like a charm on my 7x64
Andrej I don't know what you mean by TBBs. And  you are mentioning Firefox but the problem
is with the Tor browser. Meanwhile I also downloaded Firefox and there is everything ok, simple
settings you can adjust.
Any ideas n e 1 ?
Wim

Hey Wim,
When talking about TBB the Tor Browser Bundle is meant. (Including vidalia and little-t-tor; You are calling it just Tor Browser but it's the same TBB is built using the Firefox Kernel with some additions/extensions and mostly just a secure/careful configuration. So if you are using TBB / the Tor Browser you are always using Firefox.
You can manually by following this guide on Option 2. Here you need to select the path to your firefox.exe (usually in the "Tor Browser" Folder) Please let us know if this helped,
You won't believe it but right clicking the file doesn't give me the option
to "open with"! I think this must be a Windows 10 thing...
I already noticed a list in W10 where you can connect files to programs to open them with.
But I think it's type of file (e.g.  .exe) and then the program..
I'll check it out!

I'll check it out! I did and indeed, it?s type of file and then you must choose an app.
But it seems Tor isn?t recognised as an app for opening webpages.
On the other hand when I tried it with Firefox itself, that was recognised of course.... Tor isn?t even in the list of all apps on the PC, although it works fine.
What?s the next possibility?

I send this for the 2nd time because it said content type wasn?t allowed (1 smiley I put in ?)
Like someone said  I made an html document and put it on the desktop.
It immediately gets a Chrome logo. When rightclicking it I get to choose opening
by Chrome or IE(not even Edge...OR another program but as I stated before
Tor isn?t in the list of apps to open a webpage. And like I said it isn?t even in the
list of ?all apps?, but works fine...
In the meantime, Tor keeps asking met to set it as default browser and I cant help
What I tried again also is rightclicking the firefox.exe to ?open with?
but it isn?t just there (anymore?)!!
I also tried this as administrator and for another exe file, same result.
Any suggestions anyone?
Thanks in advance!!
