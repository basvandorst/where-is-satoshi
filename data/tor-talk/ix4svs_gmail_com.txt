As promised:
Summary findings:
1. Running _one_ cloud instance is very cheap (less than $5/month).
2. Running 5-6 instances from the same Amazon account gets you in the
$100-$200/month region
3. For some reason, instances in the Sao Paulo and Tokyo data centres
see much more traffic than other regions.
I would recommend everyone with an Amazon account spin up an instance
in Sao Paulo or Tokyo.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Trusteer Rapport happily working inside 
I'm using Tor browser bundle for Windows v2.2.35-7.1 (latest as of Feb
2012) and notice that Trusteer Rapport (software pushed hard by banks
in the UK that is supposed to raise the bar against
keylogging/screenshot stealing malware on Windows) is happily
functioning inside the Aurora instance of the Tor browser bundle. This
goes against the "do not install plugins in your truster browser"
I understand that Tor is not trying to protect against local attacks
and Trusteer Rapport is certainly installed on my local computer - but
the fact it's just "there" in Aurora concerns me. The result is that a
common database (of logins Rapport monitors and tries to protect) is
shared between all of my browsing sessions.
Short of running tor-browser-bundle on a read-only Linux live system
running off USB media, is it possible to somehow protect the Aurora
instance from accepting any external plugins to interfere with it? It
appears there are software bundles out there that accomplish this [0]
but that may be too far in local application protection space (and
therefore off-topic) for Tor to address.
I assume the answer in Tor-browser-bundle & Rapport's case is "no, it
cannot be blocked" - as it's supposed to trap system calls below the
browser level - but it seems to have the potential to compromise the
anonymity of people using the Tor browser bundle so I thought I'd ask.

Great idea - thanks for providing these images. Deployment of new
instances is a breeze.
One question on the included configuration: It seems to currently cap
bandwidth at 10GB/week. But AWS Free Usage Tier gives us 15GB/month.
AccountingStart month 1 10:00
AccountingMax 15 GB
be a more sensible default for people trying this out? Making this as
cost-free as possible should help with Tor Cloud adoption.
Does this config limit the usefulness of the relay?

Splendid. Just spun up one instance per region - will report on their
usage & costs once I get the first bill.

Excellent stuff, thank you!
In particular well done for keeping it at just the right level of
complexity and not overloading it with information that will
confuse/scare away most people.
I like the idea of pointing people to this picture, asking them "do
you want THIS?" and then being able to point to the Tor Browser Bundle
as a one-stop solution that provides exactly THIS.
(Now all we need to do is somehow convince the other 99% of the
population that the "NSA", "police", "sysadmin" and "lawyer" icons are
not some privacy activist's pipe-dream but real threats)

@_subject: [tor-talk] aggregate traffic relayed? 
Bytes sent/received stats as captured in the tor log are not
persistent across service restarts - every time Tor exits, the it
starts counting from zero.
What's the best way to keep aggregate Tor bandwidth usage statistics
for my relay?

Apparently the gobbledygook in the footer doesn't mean anything to
people who haven't spent years on mailing lists.
Perhaps there should be something more explicit like "To unsubscribe,
