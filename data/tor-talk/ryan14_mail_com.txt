Hi, If I am using the Tor browser bundle, does having the NoScript addon enabled offer any benefit? Would I still be completely anonymous if I used Tor browser with NoScript disabled?

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor browser bundle with vpn 
if i connect to a pptp or l2tp vpn(not openvpn) and then load tor browser bundle will this work flawlessly or are there other things i need to configure? the reason i want to use a vpn with tor browser is because on some websites when i submit a form with tor browser it comes up with a blank page and i think to fix this i would have to disable noscript which could leak my real ip if i wasnt using a vpn right?
