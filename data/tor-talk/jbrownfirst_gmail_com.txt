There is a very strong control over telephony in many countries. Many
counties intend to make this control more and more stronger.
In the Russia, when I live, for example the Putin's and Medvedev's
bloody dictatorial regim now intend to ban VoIP telephony:
Besides, there is no effective open source system of VoIP telepony which
let people freely talk and connect by chat and sending-receiving files
between each other without any control from Governments, companies etc.,
maintaining anonimity and encryption of communication at the same time.
We have only the skype but it is propietary soft belonging to a private
company aiming only gain profit not maintaining anonimity and
independence people's contacting from Governments etc.
As knows this company lets the Chineese authorities to know about
conversations between Chineese. So they can provide confidential
information about users any other Government.
But I think that their protocol is very intresting  becouse the skype
network building on a peer-to-peer model, that user directory will be
entirelyentralized and distributed among the nodes in the network, and use
encrypted connection insluding connetion with the exit node when making
calls to ordinary telephone.
Maybe I am not quite right, but this network system seems to me looking
like the Tor network.
I think that building such system based on open sources, maintaining by
open source community will protect anonymity and privacy of people and
independence each of us from goverments, corporations etc. control,
becouse we will be able to call each other without any state or
corporate control over our telephone calls.
I think that it will be very good  to include in the Tor project creatings and maintaining such VoIP telephone system or doing this  as
an independent project concurrently of the To r project.
Or including in the Tor project  simply maintaining  UDP -connections
that may let  using SIP  and etc. protocols through the Tor.

The Livejournal has blocked access to that resource through the Tor.
It is certainly the consequence of purshasing the LJ of Russian company

That decision of Russian powers of purshacing the LJ was adopted because
many Russian oppositionists used it in the conditions of suffocation of
    freedom of speech by  Putin's bloody fascist regim.
I think that all progressive humanity must require from the US President
B. Obama to order the FBI to investigate the circumstances of purshasing

But did they say you about a character of that abuse?
I thin that only an RSS feed of  LJ friends pages is not a serious
ground for blocking the Tor network.
If they did such not by order of the SUP for protection of the Russian
dictatorship I can't understand why the SUP by they 2 years ago. For
latent  shadowing against Russian oppositionists for the Federal
security service of Russia?
I was very sleepy when you wrote your letter (it was about 3 a.m at my
place) and I coudn't recognize that I could try ask them a question
concerning the next.
By the information of Russian press (see, particularly
 ) the secret
services of Russia arrested estimated murders of Markelov (many people
in Russia think that they are not real murders because real economic
base of Markelov's murder was deforestation of the Khimki forest against
which Markelov fighted and any version about the revenge of
"nationalists" have not under it real economic and money base and seems
very absurd) through LJ activity of them.
In accordance with this information they had access to the LJ not
through the Tor but through the specific public wifi - so-called WIMAX,
from account registered on assumed name.
So, the Russian secret services had needed an information about
ip-addresses of those users of the LJ for computing their through 	
triangulation with  beam gain antennas.
So, we can suspect that those ip-addresses were given to Russian secret
services by the SUP besides the official inquiry of Russian authorities
to the US authorities (as I know there is not an agreement on mutual
assistance in criminal matters between Russia and the USA).
If it was really so, it was an obvious interference of Russian
government in internal affairs of the USA in accordance with
international law.
I don't know about the US criminal law but such actions are examined as
an espionage by the Russain Criminal Code.
I think that the notion of an espionage is approximately equal in all

@_subject: Tor-exit without any exit rejection policies 
Hi people,
For protecting the Tor project I want to start an exit Tor node. Because
I live in Russia, i.e. in the country with extremal tyranic?al regime
and without any political and personal liberties, I am afraid to do it
here and I intend to rent for it a VDS/VPS-server in suitable offshore
As a victim of Russian tyrannism and dictatorship I know how important
to have a fully functional but anonymous access to the Internet.
Because it I want to set up a Tor-exit without any exit rejection policies.
Could anything of you advice me such jurisdiction for that or maybe
concrete VDS/VPS-providers having servers in such jurisdictions?

next results:

System Fonts no javascript
Are Cookies Enabled?	No
Limited supercookie test no javascript

2. If JS is enabled and J is disabled:
practically the same result except that it defined that cookies was enabled.
3. If J and JS enabled both I can see time zone, Screen Size and Color
Depth and others.
According with the above I have the next questions:
1. What is the bug in the TB which lets that test define that I use
Mozilla under Windows but not IE under Windows? Or the TB masqueradge
only the OS not the type of browser? (I thought that it masqueradge the
type of browser too, am I not right?).
2. It defined that by the browser characteristic "HTTP_ACCEPT
Headers" those are only one in about 7000 browsers have that value. Why?
What could mean the above value of that characterisrics?

the FreeBSD on a VDS)? Or I need make some configurations in that file?

Sometimes ago I ren a VDS under Debian Lenny,
~# uname -a
Linux 2.6.18-028stab070.4-ent  SMP Tue Aug 17 19:03:05 MSD 2010 i686
I set up on that VDS only exit tor-node and nothing more. I didn't stop
apache, proftpd daemon and etc. because I have intended to use it in the
feature but I didn't use it for several month.
How I have the next problem.
Some days ago I received the next messages from crondaemon:
Internal error!
Internal error!
and from rkhunter that my server have problems which you can see in the
attached log inculding detected SHV4 Rootkit and SHV5 Rootkit
When I try to start rkhunter in the shell of that server it doesn't want
to work.
chkrootkit tell me about problems too (see attached log).
unhide-tcp does not want to work as rkhunter, unhide finds seen in
attached logs.
clamav find the next:
debsums tell me the next:
 grep -i failed debsums20101126.log

How it was possible to catch that viruses, rootkits and etc. from using
an exit tor-node? Have anybody such problems? What is the security
measures takes of other owners of exit-nodes?
What is the better to me - to try clean the existing system or to give
an order to VDS provider to reinstall my VDS?
If the last way is the better (now I am inclined to that) - what files
from tor-node installation I need to save exept torrc and keys of my node?
Or it would better generate new keys through new installation of
tor-node? Could existing keys compomise my tor-node after reinstalling
my VDS?
And could it be an attack against exactly my VDS as tor-node? Could it
be an attempt of an Adversary to take control over my tor-node for
attacks against the Tor-net?!

disappears after rebooting router.
What is the better - use the tor under root user or make any script

1) There are a simple way to do it discribed on the torproject site:
But this way is not doog: it is impossible to install the TB in the
MicroB browser and all sites can see OS and other information about client.
The next, that applet is not immediatly from repositories of the
torfroject and uses old versions of the stable Tor, not the latest.
Furtherinmore, if the tor-client is dicconnected by any reason that
browser connects diretly without any warning.
2) The next way is using the easy-debian package and install the Tor in
the debian system working under `chroot`.
Now I intend to try it and after trying I will inform the community.
3) And the bettest way - as I think - as the using transparent
torification, but it probably unworkable.
As we can read here:
"Transparent proxying is not possible with the default N900 kernels at
this time".
I use now an advanced kernel and I have the "nat" table in my iptables.
I have too the utility `useradd` in my maemo-system, so I can create
another user for transparent torifying.
But I don't know is it possible to start another X11 or to use gksu for
X11-applications on my device?
Have anybody a good experience with transparent torifying of such devices?

Very thanks for those information. But what about "signature"? What
means that parameter and how does it computes?
As I suppose it is a hash of some data which browser send to server, and
it must be the same on each TBB in the World, am I right?
In the American version of the TBB it the same as in Russian but your
test indicate that in Russian version is wrong and that in in American
version is rights.
If I am right and that hash must be the same on each TBB, could you
right its right value? (I don't want to write my value here by the
security purposes).
P.S. But as I can see from  and from
 it detects from my Russian version
TBB the next:
LANGUAGE: en-us,en;q=0.5
ENCODING: gzip, deflate
CHARSET: windows-1251,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
and from American version:
LANGUAGE: en-us,en;q=0.5
ENCODING: gzip, deflate
CHARSET: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
It seems as a bug in the TBB becuase in spite of indicating of "en-us"
language it indicates Russian charset in Russian version of TBB.
Probably, I take place in other non-American-Engilsih versions of TBB.

 )
  there is no digital signature of the latest sources code of the TBB.
Please, see here :
There are some symbols but not in form of digital signature!
Sebastian confirm it on 24 March 2012
but that issue was not fixed till to now.
Please, fix it if it possible!

Thanks. it was effective now :)
There is a signature in his place now :)
P.S. Sorry for my idiotism I forgot the url-address of the main
repository of the Tor which is  :) I tried
" from my sources.list but I
found there only deb-packages :)
If it possible could the team of the Torproject give the link to the
repos on the main page of the site? For such people as I which decided
to try themselves in compiling and devoloping etc. :)

Hello, friends!
I have got a new TBB file
tor-browser-gnu-linux-x86_64-2.2.35-7.2-dev-en-US.tar.gz for the site of
the Torproject and have tried to verify it.
I have had the next result:
$  gpg --verify
gpg: Signature made Mon Feb 20 12:45:15 2012 UTC using RSA key ID 140C961B
gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
As I can the the previous version was signed by Erinn Clark:
 gpg --verify tor-browser-gnu-linux-x86_64-2.2.35-7-dev-en-US.tar.gz.asc
gpg: Signature made Sat Feb 18 19:53:24 2012 UTC using RSA key ID 63FEE659
gpg: Good signature from "Erinn Clark "
gpg:                 aka "Erinn Clark "
gpg:                 aka "Erinn Clark "
Is the sign of tor-browser-gnu-linux-x86_64-2.2.35-7.2-dev-en-US.tar.gz
right sing?

As I see, the new version of Tor is unavialable, that package works with
depricated version 0.2.2.34.

It is very pitty.
But I found the package of the latest stable tor-version in maemo repos:
 (0.2.2.35)  and upgrade my tor in
maemo through aptitude.
Futhermore, after including all needed kernel modules in the latest
version of the package "kernel-power"
 (I asked about that its
developer) it is now very simple to use transparent torification on n900
(without Tor Status Area Applet
 it needs simly
to start tor as daemon).

As I can see now, no.
I have did such you describe but I have the same result. But after

So, they probably blocked some exit-nodes.

Putin's fascist junta intend to ban the Tor and other anonimous
services:  "MPs claim that the adoption of legislative initiatives on which state
agencies can block access to sites containing illegal content, there is
still a lot of work in this area.
In particular, members are going to limit the use of the programs,
masking the information data and IP-address of users - anonymizers.
The fact is that if the decision of the court will be locked out of
Internet users to a particular site, the last by proxy will visit the
pages blocked site.
For example, with these programs, users in China and Belarus very well
go to those sites to which local authorities are blocking access.
In this regard, representatives of the lower house of Parliament propose
to ban the software, then there is a proxy server that is installed on
the user's computer, or browsers with built anonymizer for example
browser Tor. In addition to masking tools of deputies web servers -
standalone sites, with the help of which users can establish special
programs to pass the modified IP-address on the blocked sites.
Such amendments will be made to the Federal Law "On Information,
Information Technology and Information Security" and the law "On the
protection of children from information harmful to their health and
development," which has already undergone changes this summer and which
had been prescribed norms helping to block sites with illegal content.
According to the author of amendments to the legislation on blocking
access to sites with illegal content deputy Yaroslav Nil, the question
of a possible ban on the proxies will be discussed within the walls of
the State Duma.
- We now have a committee on information policy, information technology
and communications, and on it we will discuss the possibility and
feasibility of introducing a ban on the use of software, which can mask
the Internet - says Nilov. - It is quite logical decision after we have
amended the possibility of blocking sites containing illegal content.
According to another co-author of the laws of the blocking of websites
with illegal content - Deputy Speaker of the State Duma Sergei
Zheleznyaka parliamentarians intend to continue to shield users from
illegal content on the Web.
- Of course, the decisions that we have made in recent years in the
information security of users on the Internet, are not our latest
initiatives, - says Zheleznyak. - We're going to continue to fight the
"harmful" content of our networks, including software that allows any
way to mask Internet crime.
For breach of access to the network by the user using anonymizer could
face punishment - from blocking access to the Internet through an ISP to
a quite reasonable fines.
In addition to the legislators to ban proxy in Russia are the
representatives of some social movements. The leader of the
organization's anti-pedophile "Headhunters" by Sergey Zhuk, mostly
proxies are used to commit crimes on the Internet.
- Our organization supports the ban proxy in Russia. Around 99% of those
who use anonymizers to hide their information data to commit crimes.
Whether economic crimes on the Web, or viewing of child pornography, or
to access blocked sites - says the beetle. - Then it prevents the
investigating authorities find criminals, and probably would have been
extremely useful to prohibit the use of anonymizers.
Experts in the field of information technology argue that providers can
identify subscribers using anonymizers when visiting websites. However,
they doubt the effectiveness of measures already taken to block sites
with illegal content or that prohibit anonymizers.
CTO LETA Alexander Bondarenko points to technical problems in the
implementation of this idea.
- They have already legislated solutions to block sites containing
illegal content. But the decision to block the sites and bans on the use
of proxy are malorealizuemymi - said Bondarenko. - Technically competent
users will still find a way to circumvent the ban. As with the server
locks up, and when blocking of websites will be immediately blocked
their new mirror sites and servers. Therefore, most likely, and already
taken and planned solutions will remain formal."

Hello, people!
Because many my contacts continue to use Skype and don't want to use any
nice soft (such as jabber, torchat and etc.) I need to use it too.
For protecting of my location and etc. I use it only through Tor (on VM
working under transparently-torifed user).
Some days ago I would be very, very difficalt to connect to skype
through the Tor-net (earlier it was very easy).
As can I see in my Vidalia, my skype application can make resolving
through tor and can connect to hosts through port 443, but conncetions
with port 33033 cannot establish (I can the the trying to open it and
after it it closed immediatly).
As can I see the skype doesn't work without that connections which now
establishes very rarely.
I have 2 versions:
a) the Skype team ban the Tor-connections to skype (but I can still
connect to skype to ports 443 and I can to browse their web-site and
even log in to it through the Tor without any problems)
b) many Tor-exits don't let the above-mentioned port (33033) in their
It is not good from the Skype team if they do the first.
If the second  hypothesis is right I ask owners of Exit-nodes, if it
possible, to let that port in their ExitPolicies.

Very thanks.
As can I see through Vidalia and `netstat` on the stage of establishing
connections the skype-client connects with some hosts belonging
Microsoft and "Skype Technology" with ports 443, 12350, 33033
In the next time establishes connections with some other ports.
Always there was no problem to log in to skype through the Tor-net
(using transparently-torified scheme) but some days ago something was
I can log in to skype with some difficults but I cannot see status of my
contacts, chat with them and etc.
As can I see from Vidalia the Tor-client tries to open connection for
skype to port 33033 and cannot do it. Connections with 443 and 12350 are
Sometimes it connects but after some minutes it disconnects.
I don't know whether the skype ban connections or the owners of
Tor-nodes in a one moment reject the port ? 33033 but it looks like the
first not the second.
When I try to connect with skype through vpn (openvpn) after Tor-net it
works nice.
