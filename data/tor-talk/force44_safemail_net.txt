@_subject: Excludenode problem 
I want to exclude a node that has a very low speed and makes my connections drop quite every time.
So I turned off Vidalia (and Tor) and added in the torrc file:
ExcludeNodes rootkit
RendExcludeNodes rootkit
When I run away Vidalia, I often see this rootkit server in the builded connection!!! So this torrc file is not used ?? How must I do?

@_subject: General anonimity/privacy question when using TOR 
I copy below a part of the FAQ of JAP, my question is "Does it apply also to TOR?". In other words, what is better to improve a TOR user's anonymity: Stay connected a long time (or never disconnect, if he uses a cable, DSL etc connection), or often disconnect (to change his IP, for example) ?

@_subject: Socks/TOR setup question 
Sorry to come back again with this question, but I would appreciate an
help to fix this problem..
My question below; I add that I am using SockCap to socksify some
programs. SocksCap is setup with 127.0.0.1:9050 (Socks4 OR Socks5, it
doesn't change anything), and the log messages come when I use a
socksified program...
If there is a way to use the socks server of TOR without SocksCap for
software that haven't any "proxy option", I don't know them...
Thank you again.

"Error replacing "[mypath]/cached-routers.new": File exists"
"Error replacing "[mypath]/cached-routers": File exists"

I  use Tor, TorCP and Privoxy:
Privoxy listens on 8118
TOR requests are sent for http and https to 127.0.0.0 on 8118,
and to 127.0.0.1 on 9050 for the socks requests.
That works fine,  but  I am always receiving such message in the Log file:

This message is created when any application uses the TOR server, no matter if I parameter it as a socks4 or socks5.
As I am already using Privoxy, what must I change in my config so that this message isn't generated? Moreover, must I setup my applications to use TOR as a socks4 or a socks5 server>

Yes in fact I didn't explain correctly!
I use SocksCap that I point to TOR on 127.0.0.1:9050
Then, I "socksify" for example my email software, with SocksCap.
These messages always happen when I run also for example ICQ, or a FTP, SSH, email etc software also "socksified" by SocksCap.
But doing so, is there a way to remove these messages, using socksified applications through SocksCap ?

@_subject: Firefox extensions and anonymity, TOR etc 
Yes, but safe-mail.net requires JS enabled at least to connect the first time into your account. The default safe-mail template is using JS, and to change to the "No script template", you must click on button that is enabled only if JS is enabled! I asked the safe-mail team to change this a few months ago, and hope it will be done.
There are anyway a lot of free mail services (but for sure not secure as safe-mail is) that allow to open mailboxes without using JS, java or anything else.
And we can always open a mailbox for example at Yahoo, WITH JS enabled, from a wifi public and free place, conecting with a notebook and a spoofed MAC address, through TOR of course. Then we check the mailbox with NO JS, yahoo allows this!
Well, I just installed it, and guess what? In the config box, I read "Javascript must be enabled for FlashBlock to work" !!!
Uninstalled it... IMO better is to have Flash than JS enabled!
About Vidalia: There is still the PGP bug It is maybe right that the problem doesn't come from Vidalia directly, but having to chose between PGP and Vidalia, well...
I am still using TorCP, but in fact I wonder what's the advantage to use TorCP, or Vidalia, rather than simply the TOR program. During normal using, I never use any of the TorCP feature. What would be VERY great is the ability to easily put some TOR nodes (by IP, name or country!) in a personal black list, but as far as I know, no interface allows it simply.
Maybe the April3rd TOR project ( will allow this? :)
A BIG thank you to Robert Schade for his great TOR nodes map! Very interesting, and it makes me ask a question: I see a node in Saudia Arabia. Some nodes in China.. and even a node in Iran! These countries strongly control the internet. How is it possible to believe, that these nodes are not some kind of honeypots ?! And for this, it would be great to be able to easily decide to not use some TOR nodes.

@_subject: Warning, Vidalia creates problems in PGP 
I was using TorCP since a while and decided to try Vidalia. I am also using PGP (8.5, 8.5.1, and 9.xx) on a few boxes.
I didn't see anything suspicious at once, Vidalia was running fine, and PGP as always too.
But today, I saw that I couldn't anymore unmount any PGP virtual disks, and moreover, the mounted PGP virtual disks didn't show up in Windows explorer. Of course I didn't linked this problem to Vidalia! I checked my boxes against viruses, trojans, lokked all the running processes, etc. Nothing suspicious! I then uninstalled completely PGP, created a new virtual disk and made the test again: Same result!
Then I remembered that I just installed Vidalia some hours ago... I killed it... And the PGP mounted disks became visible again, and they again could be unmounted!
A few tests showed that when Vidalia is running, the PGP virtual disks cannot be unmounted, and don't show up in Explorer.
Morality: Back to TorCP... !

@_subject: Connecting to special ports through Tor/Privoxy 
Not sure it is the best place here for this topic, sorry if I mistake!
Config: Firefox 2 Privoxy Tor (Vidalia)
When I want to connect through Tor to special port as 8443 by https (Plesk panels), I simply cannot and always get a blank page. (Usual config for https is 127.0.0.1:8118)
To solve the problem, I have to delete all entries the https entry, and so I use the Socks5 proxy on 127.0.0.1:9050
Earlier I used the multiproxy extension for Firefox, had one entry "tor (usual)" and one entry "Tor (Socks5)". So that was easy to change.
Using now TorButton, this isn't the same, as I have to edit the "Preferences" every time.
Isn't there a way (probably something to add in the Privoxy config?) to be able to connect through Tor to  without using the Socks5 proxy?

Since 24 hours, e-gold has decided to block all TOR nodes, and not only. In fact they check 3 "spam databases" and if the user's IP is in one of them, e-gold just declines any operation, people cannot even login into their accounts.
There are a few things here:
It is the first time I see a website blocking IP that appear in SPAM databases! Spam is, as far as I know, an EMAIL problem, so why would a domain block surfing from these IP?
About TOR particularly, I feel very strange that all exit nodes would be listed in spam databases, as most of them (if not all) don't accept sending mail requests. That is why I rather believe that e-gold in fact fetches the TOR exit nodes list, and directly block their IP addresses.
A friend, connecting from his home in Germany without TOR, without any proxy, cannot enter his account as his IP address (a dynamic one from a dialup provider) was listed 2 months ago for spam!!!
A few people are already complaining that they cannot get into their accounts, and so their money seems to be lost! E-gold was already known to block accounts without any warning and explanations, recently blocked accounts of all Iranian people and KEPT their funds, now they automatize the scam process!
E-gold seems to be the next (or TODAY'S) major scam of the internet!

I have an idea of feature that could be interesting, but don't know

whatever the TorButton status is.
For example, there would be one more function in the right click
menu, "Bookmark this link WITH TOR". Then, the link will always use
TOR, even if Tor is turned OFF with Torbutton.

I connect to various safe-mail accounts through "secure POP" (over
SSL, port 995) to read my mail and have never problems. Or better to say that when the tor exit node doesn't connect to safe-mail, I just try again a few minutes later and usually it is ok. My mail program (Thebat) even does it all alone, it checks email every xx minutes, as I wish.
Sending mail is another story :) It is quite impossible in SMTP on 25 as in secure SMTP on 465, as most tor exit nodes block traffic to these ports. So, to send email, better is to connect to a web
interface (in https of course), safe-mail is fine for this too.

I was connected to a secure website using TOR and saw that the Firefox certificate icon was broken, a message saying that some elements are not going to ssl.
That looked strange, as the site is a bank and I was checking my account. I looked at the Vidalia panel and hadn't the time to see the exit node, I could just see "Sofia BG" as the circuit closed at this time :(
I immediately logged out, and logged in again without Tor, changed all my access code. In direct connection, no problem with the SSL icon.
Logged out and connected again through Tor 3 times, changing exit node at every time, no more SSL icon problem.
What can have happened exactly? I think that if the exit node changed the initial bank certificate for HIS certificate, I should receive a warning by the browser, no? Anyway that couldn't probably explain the fact that the SSL icon was broken.

@_subject: Using tor, help 
I am running a tor node (unfortunately not exit node because of the hostign company) since a few months on a dedicated server, all is fine.
I would like that some Perl scripts running on some websites also hosted on this server would connect through the Tor network (Using for example LWP), and will be happy to pay for receiving tech assistance for this.
More exactly I would like an easy method to use for example so that SOME LWP requests are sent through Tor (but I don't want ALL connections go throu Tor, only some of them that I especially want).
Thank you.

@_subject: Exit nodes in torrc question 
I have the following lines in my torrc file:
ExitNodes node1
AllowDotExit 1
MapAddress .site.com .site.com.node2.exit
When I connect to site.com, node2 is used as exit. I believed it should be node1, as ExitNodes is a global directive, no?
Or are the lines processed in order they are written in the file?

@_subject: Exit node and datacenter 
Since about 18 months I am hosting a Tor relay middleman" on a dedicated box rented at Rackforce in Canada and I would like to turn it to an exit node.
Any suggestion about what to do concerning the datacenter? I would like to avoid being sent offline at the 1st complaint... To unsubscribe, send an e-mail to majordomo at torproject.org with

@_subject: Tor and google groups 
Yes, but I have a nice collection of SIM cards from various countries... Every time I travel (twice a month at least) I bring back some SIM cards for this kind of "work"...
Well, I am using Privoxy since the beginning of Tor, never understood why i would have to change.
Anyway I followed your suggestion and cleaned the cache, then I could enter Googlegroups with Tor! Thanks a lot for your help :)

@_subject: Tor and google groups 
Though I could open an account at gmail, it is impossible to login to post in google groups. I am told, whetever the exit node is, "Your browser's cookie functionality is turned off. Please turn it on.".
I am using Tor, Privoxy, Firefox and Torbutton, both in their last updated releases for Win7.
Any suggestion?
Thank you, and best wishes for 2011, hoping censorship will give up... "I have a dream" :(

@_subject: Tor and google groups 
Yes in Western Europe it is so. But there are many countries were SIM cards are just sold in the streets without any requirements. Former USSR, many countries in Asia, some in Africa, etc.
I do it already for some friends but the point is that with the phone number I would be able to enter the account and change the password, read emails etc. Not that good for privacy, people who do not know me should not accept :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Mail service working with Tor 
I use myself Free to receive mails, must pay a small fee for sending mails but there are great features (scheduled mails, any "from", mailings). Payment through e-currency, so good for keeping a low profile.
(I have no connection at all with them, just this can be useful as I can connect thru TOR without problem).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Protect from yandex 
I can use TOR on Yandex without any major problem including market and partner. SOME exit nodes are blocked, just use others. To select exit nodes from Moscow, seems hard, but look at the list of exit nodes and check tehir IP, MAYBE you will see that some of them are located in Moscow.
Another way is to rent a VPN service located in Moscow, or even rent a VPS in a datacenter, use it as a proxy, send your emails through TOR to your VPS, so it will show the datacenter in Moscow IP. And if logs are checked by the datacenter< They will show TOR exit nodes from anywhere in the world.

I saw this service at CAPTCHA is funny, not sure that any robot may break it?
Mailservice is good to RECEIVE mails, tried it a few times. Sending Is not possible as it is a paid service with e-currencies that have disappeared. Site seems to be discontinued, anyway I have asked a free test to send mails and am expecting a reply :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Any free email service can work with Tor 
About MAIL.RU they will ask you a SMS validation only if somebody complaints about your mail.ru address. I myself use many boxes there, all with TOR, never got any SMS validation unless ONCE after a guy told me he will complain...
I use myself now for subscribing to lists etc, the service at They SSL certificate is self issued so I get a warning but no problem for me, for what I am doing with it... I contacted the admin there, they are modifying they system to SEND emails, but for receiving all is ok.

@_subject: [tor-talk] I am getting European nodes only? 
Using the last release of Tor Browser, I am a bit surprised: Circuits are made ONLY with European nodes! I changed "identity" a few times, asked "New Tot circuit for this site", every time there are only European nodes!
I cannot believe that Northern and Southern America, Asia, Russia, haven't any Tor node???
Any suggestion to stop this and use other nodes than only European ones?
(I didn't modify anything in the config)
Thank you!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Circuits in Orbot 
I am using Orbot for Android and was surprised to see that circuits are up to 5 nodes. I remember having read that TOR would not be more secure (and even could be UNsecure) if it would use more than 3 nodes to build a circuit.
Any explanation?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser in RAM 
On Win-7, the usual Firefox (with a dozen of extensions) uses about 180 Mo RAM.
TorBrowser, with the basic extensions supplied in the package, uses 450 Mo when launching it, and then increases itself up to about 580 Mo. Without any opened page, no connection to any website. When I connect to websites, the RAM usage grows and grows and grows... So much that I have to shut it down!
Any idea? Thank you!

@_subject: [tor-talk] TOR Browser - Change circuits 
I understand that if a node used in a circuit is down, Tor will build a new route. But if all nodes used in a circuit are running correctly, how often will Tor change the route? Is there a way to control this?
Thank you
