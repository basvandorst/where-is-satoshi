@_subject: [tor-talk] Torify WebDAV? 
Apologies for those who already read my message at the tor-onions
mailing list [0]. But, as I got no answer there, I am trying now here.
I have an onion service with a Nextcloud server. I would like to access
its files from a GNU/Linux 32-bit computer. Nextcloud desktop client is
torifyable, but it is 64-bit.
I tried to access my files with
torsocks nautilus
so that I could access them in Nautilus through "Connect to server"
using WebDAV, but it says it cannot resolve hostname. I don't know how
to troubleshoot. Any help is very much welcome.
I also tried by davfs2 as explained at
I followed the instructions, but I do not know how to torify it in order
to reach my .onion domain. The things I tried do not work (torsocks
mount ./nextcloud)
Any suggestion on how to access my onioned Nextcloud files from my
32-bit GNU/Linux computer will make me very happy!
Thank you!

Problem solved, I found the 32-bit Nextcloud client I needed.

I remember Tor Broswer used to create a new circuit per tab. It had also
the "Create new circuit" button.
What happened?
How come I have now the same IP address on every tab?
How come the new-cicuit button is not there anymore?
I am also curious to know why the list of the three nodes being used per
circuit is not shown anymore.
Thank you.

Does anyone know how to torify deja-dup so that I can use an onion
service as the storage location?
And, is this the right list to ask for this kind of support?
Thank you.

Thank you, that sounds good.
But for now I am looking for something lighter and simpler.
Any other solution?

Wow, Shaarli seems just what I need. Thank you!
Are you talking about Nextcloud? If so, please let me know your
thoughts. I just know the android client is bad, they did a very
complicated thing instead of letting the user choose per folder 2 way
sync or one-way upload or download sync.
But thought the rest was ok...

I have several email accounts in Icedove. When trying to get new
messages, does TorBirdy create a unique Tor circuit per selected
account? Or does TorBirdy sync all my email accounts through the same

By the way, is this the right place to ask about TorBirdy?

Anyone syncs Torbrowsers' bookmarks?
How do you do it?
Maybe with your self-hosted server?
Maybe through Nextcloud Bookmarks [0] and Floccus [1]?
Do you see any problem?
Anyone tested it?
