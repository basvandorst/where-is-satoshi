@_subject: First results of analysis 
Hi  *coderman*   :
May be but read this thread first to have a the complete story:
Newsgroups: gmane.network.tor.user
The *facts* collected until now shows that the problems seems to comes from
web site hosting with some "services" for their "valuable customers" like
"filtering" and adding some redirections and frames for advertisement...
Look at this post about some "tests" with so-called rogue exits nodes:
Newsgroups: gmane.network.tor.user
Based on the data collected until now, the problem do not comes from the exit nodes
but from some web site hosting services...

@_subject: EXPERIMENTAL Windows binary for 0.1.1.24; please let us know if it works. 
Hi  *Nick Mathewson and other Tor users*   :)
Version 0.1.1.23 works for me with no problem.
Here some feedback about the new version of Tor (0.1.1.24) for W32 Typical error messages are: "instructions at address 0x0012e7a7 use memory address 0x00000800. Memory can't be read"
at boot time,
"Impossible to start Tor Win32 Service on local computer, Error 2 : specified file not found."
if I try to start the service manually.
1- The reason of these error messages are:
The command line of Tor when running as service (demon) is:
"C:\Program Files\Tor\tor.exe" --nt-service -f "C:\Program Files\Tor\torrc"
but the typical Tor installation keep the config files in this folder:
C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Tor
[The user name "administrator" may be different from one system to an
Did the torrc file [and the other files of this folder] must be copied from here:
C:\Documents and Settings\Administrateur\Application Data\Tor\torrc
to there:
C:\Program Files\TOR
Or Did we have to changed torrc ImagePath of the service in the registry C:\Program Files\tor
C:\Documents and Settings\Administrateur\Application Data\Tor\torrc  There is no "ControlPort 9051" at the end of this command line
like when we run Tor as user program instead of NT Service...
"C:\Program Files\Tor\tor.exe" --nt-service -f "C:\Program Files\Tor\torrc"
"C:\Program Files\Tor\tor.exe" --nt-service -f "C:/Documents and
Settings/Administrateur/Application Data/Tor/torrc"
instead of that:
"C:\Program Files\Tor\tor.exe"  -f "C:/Documents and
Settings/Administrateur/Application Data/Tor/torrc" ControlPort 9051
Did we have to add "ControlPort 9051" to the command line ?
2- At the startup the Tor service and Vidalia start very fast
   and makes access to the Tor network (That's very good !!!)
   (As I can see with my firewall log for example...)
   but:
   Vidalia can not update automatically the new IP address
   and this must be done manually ...
When The Ip address is manually changed in Vidalia it's updated in message log.
   But Did it is updated in the Tor network too ? I'm not sure of this...
   in Vidalia | Network Map
   No connections are shown except    No connections are build according to Vidalia display:
   and
   no internet access are possible thru Tor with a web browser for example
3-  When Tor is stopped from Vidalia the Tor service is stopped     but Vidalia shows "Tor is stopping" and remain in this state...
4- The log in stdout do not give typical informations such as Server
fingerprint, OR and DIR port reacheable and so on...
5- If you want to save the Vidalia log file to C:\Program
Files\TOR\Tor-log.txt  you have to create Tor-log.txt manually *before* saving the log there  otherwise this crash Vidalia (not Tor).
6- The Vidalia "New Look" and features are Super!    (The french version was fixed too : thank you !  :-)  )
7- When the new version of Vidalia and Tor for W32 is *not* running as NT Service but as user program, Tor run with no problem.
Hope this help.

@_subject: Analyzing TOR-exitnodes for anomalies 
Hi  *Robert Hogan*   :
Hmmm... Personnaly I don't believed that Whistlemother (or any other nodes)
are responsible for this...  It looks like web server filter or DNS server
But now how to explain the same behaviour with
a web site like   a web site like hotmail.com ???
They don't share the same web hosting service...
Is this a new "filter" for Web sites or Web Hosting ?
An other question:
How this "filter" spot a Tor exit like Whistlemother?
I guess it's based on the IP address of this exit node.
(Or the browser referer sent to the web site... ??? )
Since no exit nodes have a control on what is doing by Tor users, Is it
possible that some bad guys had used Tor for "unacceptable" things and put the Whistlemother Ip address into a "black list" of this hypothetical
"filter" ???
One way to check this is to compare exit nodes with a fixed IP address
with the exit nodes with a dynamic Ip address and if this make a
difference.  If an exit node with a dynamic IP address is not spoted as a bad IP in the
hypothetical "bad list fliter", therefore the filter is based on IP address Many test must be done before to prove this.
If the behaviour of Fixed Ip address exit nodes and the behaviour of Dynamics Ip address exit nodes
are the same
a) the hypothetical filter is not based on Ip address
b) there is no such filter but somethings else...
??? [not sure ...]  :-\
( !!! Hmmm.. I to revised my formal logic manuals a little bit .. ;-)  )
It's hard to find enough data about this problem because there's no way to
easily reproduce it.

Hi  *M*   :
Check this with Vidalia ... Please let us remain calm like Norwegian sailors in the storm. For the moment nothings prove that any exit nodes are responsibles for this.
We have to do somethings based on facts not fears...
I suggest, If the facts prove that some exit nodes are responsible, that we
keep them temporarely, instead of immediatly blocking them, and use them
as "guinea pig" to study their behaviour and prevent that kind of abuse in
the future.
Consider this as a laboratory experience with "cyber-rats" !  ;-)
Better than SETI at Home IMHO.

Hi  *Matt Edman*   :
Tor. I Fixed it by moving torrc and the other files from APPDATA%\Tor\ to
%PROGRAMFILES%\Tor\ I mention this for the other W32 users who read this news group...
OK. I'll send Vidalia bugs there. Thanks.
I fixed it the same way the other err. message...
First news. I'm running a Tor server since the last August.
I know what I'm doing. Be sure of this. :-D
Yes Sir.
Services can be also controled with sc or net command line...
I asked this question because the command line of Tor
when runned as user program include this variable
but not when it's runned as NT Service.
I have a dynamic IP address. When this address is changed for any reason
the new one is never taked in account by Vidalia and by Tor...
The variable "Address" in torrc file is not updated automatically
and Tor is still running with the old one...
Nothings in the log.
I have these symptoms:
in Vidalia | Network Map
   No connections are shown except    No connections are build according to Vidalia display:
   and
   no internet access are possible thru Tor with a web browser
stdout : standard output: the screen display in Vidalia.
When Tor is started, normally there is informations in the log such as
Server fingerprint, DIR and OR reachable...
When Tor is runned as NT Service these informations are not displayed in
the "stdout" ...
You're wellcome.

@_subject: Tor not working 
Hi  *Spin Doctor*   :
1- May be Mac OS firewall should be checked first (ipfw)
If you have a personal firewall that limits your computer's ability to
connect to itself, be sure to allow connections from your local
applications to local port 8118 and port 9050. If your firewall blocks
outgoing connections, punch a hole so it can connect to at least TCP ports
80 and 443, and then see this FAQ entry.
2- May be some file permission to be checked with chmod
When you are running Tor on Mac OS X and Vidalia isn?t responding (circling
umbrella) or when you see a message in your syslog like:
Jun 31 12:34:56 Abcd crashdump[354] : tor crashed Jun 31 12:34:56 Abcd crashdump[354] : crash report written to:
And in your crash report you find a lines like
Exception:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (0x0001) Codes:      KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE (0x0002) at 0x00000000
It is much likely that your torrc was set up with wrong permissions. chmod
o+rw torrc should fix your problem. Its very lovely from Mac OS X to kill
the Tor process with a EXC_BAD_ACCESS instead of invalid permissions. This
problem should be fixed in the next few releases.
When it's working, Tor should report that it 'has successfully opened a
circuit. Looks like it's working.' Also you say : "It worked fine yesterday, but today it will not connect to any site"
You may find some hints from the Tor error and warning messages (in Vidalia) or from your firewall log and so on...
Did Mac OS have a feature equivalent to the System Restore in W xp ?
This can be the most simple things to do.
Let us know.

@_subject: Confused about Tor settings 
Hi  *jon smith*   :
Tor button set the connection configuration to socks v5
and let ftp and gopher at 0...
You are confused because it is and you're not a moron jon smith !
I had tried different setup since last august for a lot of W xp
applications. For firefox the most simple connection config is
the Tor button setup.
But you have to know that DNS leaks are still presents ...
For example;
The only way if found was to block the UDP port 53 for firefox (and the other applications) with my firewall.
No "about:config" parameters stop the DNS request launched
by this application (v 1.5.0.7) ...
[ network.proxy.socks_remote_dns set as True have no effect... ]
This [Tor button + fw setup]works perfectly for firefox but not with Thunderbird...
I tried various connection setup; Freecap, Torcap and so on.
These works with pop3 not pop3s (such as Gmail on port 995)
so for Tb I add pop3 and pop3s servers IP addresses in the HOSTS file.
The Ftp is always blocked with any connection configuration.
It can be partly avoided by using an external Ftp client and
the correct socks setup but not for many Ftp transfer within
the browser and I found no way to redirect these Ftp requests
to an external application ...
You have to know that the Ftp protocol is a weird one...
In active mode it's behaved like a "basic" p2p application
and in passive mode it's required a large set of available ports...
(Lat but not least I'm on W xp not Unix/Linux and you can figure out how a "Billou's OS" is less flexible:
no "sh" here !  :-(((  )
As you see there is a lot of reason to be confused!
Use Tor button with Firefox
Block UDP port 53 with your firewall for the applications you're using with Tor.
I hope you're less confused now.
Let us know.

@_subject: More bad tor server? 
Hi  *News Assi*   :
The exit node allow the Http requests and they, as far as I know, add anything to these requests.
Take also in account that the requests transit accross many nodes before the exit one. The ad frames comes from the web sites. Normally privoxy control this. (And some Firefox extensions such as AdBlock plus, NoScript and so on)
Did web filtering is enabled in privoxy?
Check this in the Main configuration file:
4.2. toggle
the variable "toggle" must be set to  0
and no # at the beginning of the line...
What you can do is to make an experience. Go to the web sites you're talking about and check in Vidalia what is the exit node.
Check if you have this ad frame then:
Click on "New identity" and check again the same site...
If there is a difference with some exit nodes then try this:
In torrc file add these variables:
ExitNodes nickname,nickname,...
 A list of preferred nodes to use for the last hop in the circuit. These
are treated only as preferences unless StrictExitNodes (see below) is also
? StrictExitNodes 0|1
If 1, Tor will never use any nodes besides those listed in "ExitNodes" for
the last hop of a circuit.
and add the "no ad frame" node as exit node ...
or , as you wish, you may try to use my node as the exit.
My node is GULLIVER and it's presently running at 79 Kb/s...
Somethings like:
ExitNodes GULLIVER
StrictExitNodes 1
in torrc file then restart Tor.
Remark. I'm sure this experience will failed
since these frames do not comes from the nodes...  ;-)

@_subject: Confused about Tor settings 
Hi  *jon smith*   :
The DNS leaking comes from the application itself, not socks...
If I don't block the internet access to the port 53 in UDP, Firefox send a DNS request and the socks setup is no taking in account...
It's seems that socks are not completly supported by Firefox.
(on Windows XP only ???? )
This can be checked on W xp with a (good) firewall log or with a packet sniffer such as Ethereal or Packtyzer.
I guess there is no relation between Ftp (active or passive mode) and DNS leaks.
I checked with Google to find a sample ruleset for ipfw
but it's seems that only the packets are filtered not a specific
application. So how to do this? I have no idea ...  :-(
In this example I found no way to block a port/protocol to a specific application...

It's a closed source OS and not well documented. [The MSDN documentation looks to be written by and for "E.T." !!! ;-)  ]

A kind of DNS poisonning? (From a local DNS server or Remote DNS server...)

What we can do is to report any "strange side effect" including:

@_subject: Analyzing TOR-exitnodes for anomalies 
Hi  *glymr*   :
Alexander W. Janssen hypothesis is based on "suspected" exit nodes with
a policy allowing an exit to port 80 ... My point is somewhat different: a second hypothesis may be based on
the exit nodes with an exit policy to port 53 ...
Here we have different possibilities:
exit nodes with exit policy allowing port 53 (only)
exit nodes with exit policy allowing port 80 (only)
exit nodes with exit policy allowing ports 80 and 53 (only)
exit nodes allowing 80, 53 and other ports
In order to check if the Port 53 is valid or not I guess the easiest[?] way is to contact poeple responsible for these exit nodes and ask them which
DNS server the're using... So these DNS server may be checked by other Hmmmm... there's also poeple with local DNS server...  :-/
I guess the main problem with this issue is the lack of data.
We need more facts about this from Tor users ...
Well... I have no "bee in my bonnet"...  :-/

Hi  *Thomas Hluchnik*   :
[ Correction: for our english {only} speaking friends ...  ;-) ]
My german is somewhat limited so
Ich habe mit der Hilfe linguistische Werkzeuge ?bersetzt Google.  ;-)
The independent national center for data security Schleswig-Holstein (ULD)
criticizes in connection with the seizure of anonymization servers the
police. ULD leader Thilo Weichert expresses itself in a report ?irritated
over the criminal professionalism lacking of the investigators?. It is the common request of data-security commissioners and punishing
pursuers to make child pornography in the Internet secured. It is at any
time possible with a concrete first suspicion and with judicial resolution
with the anonymization service AN.ON, widens from child pornography back
to pursue.    On 6 September according to report of the ULD due to a resolution of the
district court Konstanz of the anonymization servers of the ULD was
seized. The seizure accomplished with a security leader in Karlsruhe is only communicated to the ULD after ?own costly searches on 11 September?.
The ULD kept the seizure resolution further two days later only after
renewed demand. The action obviously stands in connection with further
seizures with operators of anonymization services in the past days. A goal
of the police actions is it to make users of child pornography in the
Internet.    With the current seizure and the short term loss due to it from AN.ON the
authors were warned, continue to write the ULD. The public prosecutor's
office has now besides a computer, which will not bring further
realizations, since AN.ON does not store connecting data. ?Would have each
Internet criminal list in the meantime admits to be, how AN.ON functions.
All legal and technical information is publicly in the Internet callable;
the ULD stands for the consultation of the punishing pursuers ready?,
describes Weichert    Beyond that being more than negligent that the punishing pursuers with
their seizure made Internet more uncertain, ?by it provisionally with the
ULD computer the only from a German independent authority operated mixes
from traffic pulled and thus the protection from net espionage prevents?.
The ULD points out that AN.ON is a project promoted by the Federal
Ministry for economics and work. It makes possible for Web users to surf
with the help of the software JAP free of charge unobserved. It serves -
as demanded by the German Telediensterecht  (tele protection right???  C.L.) - the guarantee of the data security in the world-wide net and also from many enterprises to the protection from restaurant economics is used. The ULD inserted Konstanz complaint against the resolution of the district court. The service AN.ON is again in the net, ?soon also again with its own ULD computer?, promises the data-security commissioners.

Experiment! Try with 5 Kbytes/sec then 10, 20 and so on...
(For a server the minimum is 20 Kbytes /sec.)
You don't have to give all your bandwith to Tor ...
I have an ADSL connection and run a server at 70/75 Kbytes/sec.
Why you don't make a phone call to somebody at your ISP to know the bandwith and speed for your connection ?

@_subject: Using Gmail (with Tor) is a bad idea 
Hi  *Fabian Keil*   :
I'm using Gmail with Tor and Thunderbird not Firefox or an other browser.
pop.gmail.com on port 995 -> SSL  ...
smtp.gmail.com port 587 -> TLS ...
So the connections between my computer and the Google servers are encrypted. (With or without Tor...)
With this the only privacy problem remaining is what Google is doing with the mail data in their servers... and this can be easily solve by
using PGP/ GnuPG.
I'm not convinced that Tor failed to encrypt correctly the communications
with the combination of Tor + Firefox + Gmail ...
If your demonstration is correct there is a problem with Tor itself:
how a Man-in-the-middle may have an access to the authentication cookies ?
I'm interested to have some advices on this.

Hi  *Fabian Keil*   :
Just one remark Sir.
This site is accessible by anybody in clear :
which reveal these informations:
DE *zwiebelkuchen       tor.fabiankeil.de                                            DE *zwiebelsuppe        tor.fabiankeil.de  So it's easy to find fabiankeil.de
and finally:
You leave your email address in clear (in text) in your web site.
This reveal your ID and this is the best way to be spamed... No?
Did using Gmail + Tor + Thunderbird + Pgp/GnuPG and access  Gmail with SSL/TLS connexion is not a better solution ?
Everythings is encrypted this way:
with the SSL/TLS connexion to send/received emails
with GnuPG to encrypt the content of these emails
and with Tor to encrypt all the transmissions...

Hi  *Exile In Paradise*   :
Big Bother or not, how Google may keeps an eye on our mails if it's encrypted with GnuPG ??? On SSL/TLS connexions ?
With Tor?
Talking about Big Brother (and paranoia):
Tor was'nt developped at the beginning by a branch of the U.S. Navy ?  ;-)
