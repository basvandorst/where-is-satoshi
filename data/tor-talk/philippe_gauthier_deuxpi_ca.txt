Le lundi 18 avril 2005 ? 22:29 +0100, Adam Langley a ?crit :
Then as an exercise, I put together some Python code which does forward
HTTP GET commands to a SOCKS v4a server (Tor). I guess it shouldn't be
very difficult to implement at least POST, CONNECT and HTTPS from that.

@_subject: Sorbs 
On my side, the latest answer I got from SORBS (Matthew Sullivan) was to
suggest to not use Tor nodes as mail servers.
For example, the server that is running Tor here is also being set up as
a remailer (in addition to my personal mail server.) I can only hope
that the SORBS problem will not interfere significantly; I also don't
care anymore about SORBS delisting.
The best we can do now is to educate people about blacklists and about
the SORBS case. Pointing (techical-savvy) people to the or-talk thread
( is a good

Exactly the same thing for me. I asked for a delisting from SORBS 4
times in the last months.
You can read from the SORBS site that they are cooperating wuth an
effort called "DarkNet". This system will register the source IP address
of packets entering traps of otherwise unused IP blocks. My opinion is
that some user of the Tor network made a request for an address in one
of these IP blocks, which made the Tor exit node being tagged.
I will try to contact SORBS though their support system to see where it
can lead. They haven't been very cooperative in the past.

If anyone wants to test this without playing with patches and CVS, I put
the Debian package (sarge) I built on the web:
My node (deuxpi) will be running the patch from now. I will take a look
into the patch when I'll have some more time.
Just one question: is it recommended to turn debug logging on?

"\303\250" (octal) looks like 0xC3E8, which also corresponds to the UTF-8 glyph
"?". Anyway, internationalized domain names should be converted to ASCII form
(Punycode) to work correctly, so this is likely just a web browser or client
software problem.

I was thinking about this problem a while ago and found that a Squid web proxy
could be used to answer HTTP requests. Squid would then forward the requests to
another proxy (Privoxy) see:
There is some discussion of this method and security implications at:

Take a look at Mixmaster anonymous remailers. This protocol is a
cousin of Tor (Mixmaster has "high latency" while Tor has "low latency".)
To be able to receive replies to anonymous messages, there is a
feature of anonymous remailers called reply-blocks that uses the older
protocol called Cypherpunk. This protocol uses PGP encrypted envelopes
and a system called a nym server.
Finally, many anonymous remailers should be reachable through Tor (via
hidden services or alternate ports.)
