Hi, everyone!
I've just signed up to the list, and am still feeling my way (been a while since I've used a mailing list like this), so please excuse any bumps!
I've just downloaded and installed TOR to another of my computers that I use to try out new stuff on, but I can't seem to get it working properly. It all seemed to install OK, and when I start it, it seems to be connecting to the network OK too, but I'm unable to actually access any websites using it. So I'm asking for help here from those who know these things, as I'd really like to get TOR up and running ASAP.
My system spec is as follows:
Celeron 1.1GHz
128 Meg
20GB drive (about 2GB free)
XP Home SP3
Firefox 3.0.16 (I think - it updated last night...)
My ISP is Orange Broadband in the UK, and I'm running AVG Free 8.5, XPAntispy, Spybot-S&D and also have Malwarebytes Anti-Malware installed as a scanner.
When TOR is disabled, I can browse perfectly normally, but with it enabled, I just can't get to any websites at all - Not even the most basic HTML-only pages.
So I'm looking for advice on what's wrong, and what I need to do to fix it, and any help will be VERY gratefully received!

I downloaded the latest stable version a couple of days ago, and there were no errors in the log when I checked that. Your suggestion that it could be the firewall getting in the way certainly makes sense - What's the best way to test and fix that?
