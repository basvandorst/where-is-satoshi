@_subject: [tor-talk] How to make 100.000 bridge? 
Yes, it's really a problem to find a tech-savvy person to run a private bridge outside the censored regions. Recently, I wanted to test obfsproxy and that adds to the problem! I had to find a person having enough time and knowledge to configure an obfsproxy server out there!
Any idea to make the whole process of "making a machine a Tor bridge" more automated is great! Right now, Vidalia interface is really straightforward in setting up a Tor bridge, but to make it operational, the port forwarding part which should be done manually (in most cases) is a hassle for a normal user.
