@_subject: [tor-talk] New arm version doesn't show connections 
Hash: SHA1
For what it's worth, I don't think this is actually related to the arm
upgrade, I would guess that Stephan may have also recently updated to
Tor 0.2.3.9; when I upgraded a node to 0.2.3.9 I also found that the
connections panel behavior changed; previous to Tor 0.2.3.9, the arm
connections panel showed both circuits created by my Tor instance as
well as all the other inbound and outbound connections on behalf of
clients.  With Tor 0.2.3.9, arm is only showing circuits my relay has
explicitly created (ie when it's starting up), and in normal
steady-state operation, shows nothing.  Testing the connection
resolvers returns:
proc       2453 results     1.4369 seconds
netstat    2449 results     1.4570 seconds
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/share/arm/test.py", line 43, in     connectionResults = connections.getConnections(resolver, "tor",

Were you presented with a captcha for this second query?  If not, I
would expect that would be why the redirect code wouldn't have been
triggered; the question and redirect are relevant for queries where a
captcha is presented, not all searches.

Any additional data points needed for chasing down any remaining
(non-Windows) bugs?  I'm getting the latest git version pushed out to
a few relays that we'd upgraded to 0.2.3.6 (and had crashes on), happy
to help test specific failures if it'd be useful.

Sounds good, I've got a 0.2.3.6-alpha-dev from master earlier this
morning running on a few hundred megabits/sec of relays and bridges,
will roll a new dist from the current HEAD of master and get that
testing on a couple more that I haven't yet updated.  Will let you
guys know if anything blows up!

Hash: SHA1
Maybe I'm being dense, but under what circumstances does it make sense
for a GPG public key to be ... not public?  I genuinely would like to
better understand your position.  My specific questions on your example:
* If you want to hide your key from me, how do you expect me to reply
to the communication while maintaining the confidentiality?  I don't
understand a use case in which this would make sense.  Hiding it from
the public is one thing, but hiding it from the recipient?
* What do you mean by "may be used to ask you to disclose a specific
key", exactly?  The only thing doing the "asking" is my trusted local
GPG instance, and in the case of --throw-keyids, it will actually be
asking me /more/ questions and causing significantly more risk of
information disclosure in the case of system compromise (but if my
system is already compromised, I've already lost, so I still don't
understand the threat profile here either).
* I won't argue about the third party, but that's already handled
automatically by Enigmail when you BCC, which is typically the only
way that third party key would get in the mix in a standard Enigmail
use case scenario.
Additional to all of this, the GPG key itself is never being disclosed
here, just its key ID.  It's still giving a unique identifier from
which you can build a social graph, I'll grant you, but again, I'd
argue that it's a real stretch to say this information is anything
more than is already disclosed in the required SMTP headers.
Please, educate me!

I've recently started using  for a personal VPS.  I
believe they're in Iceland if traceroute tells it true, and their
prices seem reasonable.  Haven't had any complaints so far.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
The average bridge user likely has no idea where their bridges are
geographically located; they simply request bridges from BridgeDB via
one of the available mechanisms, or get them from trusted contacts,
and use them, without worrying about where they are.  So it's not at
all surprising for a bridge in the US to see traffic from all over the

@_subject: [tor-talk] No Ident response on IRC when using Tor 
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
The ident request involves the IRC server initiating a connection back
to the IP you are connecting from and requesting ident information.
It doesn't matter what exit you use, this will never work for a Tor
server, as it won't have any information to return.  This is simply
something that is expected when using Tor, and is unrelated to the
disconnect message in your original post.  It's rare (if it happens at
all) for an IRC server to refuse clients based on a lack of ident
