@_subject: [tor-talk] whats the very first connection initialized by tor at 
whats the very first connection initialized by tor at startup and where does it go? i couldnt find any information on google or torproject.org...
i mean there must be a server who got at least a bit of information about some nodes to start from. like in bittorrent where the tracker knows all the peers.
can anyone explain that to me or is there a link with further information about that?

yeah, i found it:
"add_default_trusted_dir_authorities(authority_type_t type)"
so, if someone in my network, for example my ISP knows this "trusted_dir_authorities", he could route everey request to a lets say "virtual-tor-network"-server who handels all the traffic i do over tor, acts as everey node i think im connected to, acts as every entry and exit - every circuit...
i mean that would be possible right? of course must be some complex programming but still...
who are this trusted_dir_authorities, servers set up by who?
These would be the directory authorities that can be found in the
function add_default_trusted_dir_authorities in src/or/config.c.
There is an exception, of course: if you're using bridges, Tor is
required to go through a bridge beforehand.

why do i always see, at least most of the time the same Nodes in my circuits?
for example "noiseexit01(c)(d)(...)" or "TORy(1)(2)(...) and so on...

ah, what i forgot to ask:
are these trusted_dir_authorities regular nodes with fingerprints and so on?
These would be the directory authorities that can be found in the
function add_default_trusted_dir_authorities in src/or/config.c.

@_subject: [tor-talk] always connected to the same couple of Nodes, why? 
why do i always see, at least most of the time the same Nodes in my circuits?
for example "noiseexit01(c)(d)(...)" or "TORy(1)(2)(...) and so on...
dont care some much about noiseexit01 and TORy - of course the are multible (so chances are higher to get a connection here), but anyway, the few more others (also almost always the same) dont change the thing...
i mean there are over 2000 nodes and i always get may the 15-20 same nodes?
whats wrong? any help?

@_subject: [tor-talk] duckduckduck.com redirect-try on google query 
90% of the time i type a search-query in the right search bar (google), Aurora wants to redirect me to i think mostly duckduckduck.com and asks for confirmation. if i click "dont redirect" it brings me to google captcha window and after i type the correct letters, im connected with google...
how come? the google query supposed to go over https, how can the last Nodes change that? or is the ExitNode anyway?
what to do to stop that?
i found a littlebit on google about this topic but not really an answer...

are you running the config for test purposes, or is there a good reason why using always the same EntryNode?
no judgment, really just want to learn!

so, google thinks im kind of spammer because of my IP-adress which probably has done bad thingd too, and asks me to redirekt to another site like duckduckgo... right? did i understand, so its not a certainly bad exitnode...
