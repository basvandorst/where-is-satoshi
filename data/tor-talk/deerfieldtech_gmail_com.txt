@_subject: Tor and SMEServer ? 
Hi Philippe;
I was hoping to see some replies to your post... I use privoxy/tor on
SME7. I used the tor package from the RPMForge repository (DAG/Dries)
and the privoxy and e-smith-privoxy RPMs from
Then I modified my privoxy config file according to the
recommendations on the tor website, tor.eff.org . Remember that you
don't want to use squid! It will, as it is configured on SME7 anyway,
leak your domain. Of course, the e-smith-privoxy contrib sets you up
to use squid so I'm not sure it is necessary to install it at all.
Anyway, if you'd like to discuss this further, sign up on the forums
at contribs.org and I'll join you there. I prefer privoxy to all the
other filtering proxies I've tried, it has a decent web based
configuration, and I see that there has been some recent activity with
the project; version 3.0.5 is in beta.

For others that may be reading along, the thread is now here:

How about tor on a WRTG54 wireless router? That would be cheap, and I
would guess it's possible given the linux OS firmware. I can't make
this happen since I'm not a programmer, but the idea has occurred to
me before. I like the HyperWRT project, Thibor version.
( Maybe start a thread in the forums to see
what the response is.

@_subject: Aggressive probe of anonymity 
I'm wondering if there is a site or a set of scripts that I could host
on my own site that agressively probes a browser connection for
anonymity. I'd like to test various browser/proxy/os configurations,
mostly for learning purposes and for identifying what and to what
degree different technologies are vulnerable.

Thanks for the reply, but both of those sites (I know grc well, new to
pcflank) assume a direct connection to the internet. I'm looking for a
test of this situation; on the tor network, behind a firewall on a
network with a local IP; various operating systems. Then I'd like to
have things like java, javascript, cookies, images, flash, etc. tested
for leakage of identifying information.
As an example, squid can be configured to send your proxy/host type
(ipid.shat.net), which even though you're on tor will reveal your
actual IP address (or at least your server name). So ipid.shat.net
shows this, many other ip address testing pages do not.

If someone were to upgrade/change their server OS or generate a new
key for purely non-malicious reasons, this could happen, no?
