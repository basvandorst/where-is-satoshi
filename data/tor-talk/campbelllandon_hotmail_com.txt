@_subject: [tor-talk] Trouble with signal newnym 
I'm new to Tor, and I'm working on developing a crawler that uses Tor via Polipo/C# HttpWebRequest. So far, making an HTTP request via Polipo through Tor is working like a charm. However, I would like to change my route/exit node more often than every 10 minutes. Every single bit of advice I can find about this, including the Tor documentation, says that all I have to do is Telnet into the Tor control port and issue the "signal newnym" command, and I'll move to a new circuit. However, it's simply not working. I am using a C# Telnet wrapper called Minimalistic Telnet, and issuing the following:
TelnetConnection tc = new TelnetConnection("127.0.0.1", 9051);tc.WriteLine("AUTHENTICATE \"pwd\" SIGNAL NEWNYM");I'm scraping an ASP.NET page I setup on a development server to check IP, and the command is NOT changing the IP. The Vidalia log shows "New control connection opened", and I get a "250 OK" response, but that's it: no other messages logged, and the circuit is not changed. Is there anyone who could tell me what I'm doing wrong?Thanks,Landon

@_subject: [tor-talk] Limited Exit Nodes? 
I have my Tor configuration limited to US-only exit nodes via torrc like so:
StrictNodes 1ExitNodes {US}
I'm getting US-only exit nodes, but the problem is I appear to be limited to about 18 nodes! Everything I check indicates that there are about 300 active exit nodes in the US at any given time -- why am I only getting the same 18 over and over again?!?
Thanks,Landon
