@_subject: Removing TOR from Registry 
No disrespect to TOR users and all those who put in all the hard work to make a reliable program (free more importantly) that innocent people can use and I myself have enjoyed the privileges of trying to browse anonymously as an extra security feature but once again I am having to remove Tor and not look back for a while cos it does get in the way of some of my other installed applications.
I use Windows not Linux which Tor appears to be better suited.
I have just recently solved a problem after my pc became corrupted and I found privoxy blocking ads from my FTP client - I needed the latest Macromedia Flash player.
Is there a command I can run in the command prompts to completely clear TOR from my system or registry safely?
I reiterate, this is temporary and I do intend reusing TOR again sometime in the future again.

Forgot myself everybody,
I have been here before - I am supposed to use plain text. Sorry about the last message in blue background.

@_subject: Tor with webmail/pop3/imap/smtp  
The quoted below response would be a great idea and I'd certainly volunteer myself to try this out.
I'm no techie but always happy to try the odd application out.
Should it appear, I'd like to learn of it in the announcements as I won't be on this list for very long.
"To overcome just this problem, I'm thinking about setting up an e-mail
service from WITHIN Tor as a set of hidden services. Basically, it
would be a webmail/pop3/imap/smtp service, that only accepts new
account requests from within tor and has a limit on the amount of
e-mails that could be sent per account per interval.
Does anyone know if this already exists, and if not, would it be a
welcome addition Tor?

Can you recommend the image back-up program you use?
I have been looking for one for a while.
Norton's Ghost is useless.
I dare not use reg-mechanic or any other registry cleaner.
I have used such programs before and they have messed up my pc because there are programs I only use once in a while or are linked to those that I do use.

Nice to know I am not the only person who feels incompetent sometimes.
Half the time I don't read stuff properly and learn through trial and error.

Sounds complicated alright.
Ain't no techie and prefer programs that leave me with little to do I hate commands.
What you see is what you get programs are my general preferences.
