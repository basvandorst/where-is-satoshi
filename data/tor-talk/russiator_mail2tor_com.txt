"The Tor Project has learned that there may be an attempt to incapacitate
our network in the next few days through the seizure of specialized
servers in the network called directory authorities. (Directory
authorities help Tor clients learn the list of relays that make up the
Tor network.) We are taking steps now to ensure the safety of our users,
and our system is already built to be redundant so that users maintain
anonymity even if the network is attacked. Tor remains safe to use.
Is it Russia? They put up a $110,000 bounty to take down Tor only about 5
months ago:
Russia offers $110,000 to crack Tor anonymous network

What's ridiculous is to think Russia only is proffering $110,000. I
suspect there's a lot more 'there' there than those articles suggest.
The Russia link doesn't seem very far fetched to me. Maybe you have better
reasoning than "it's not a lot of money, therefore, ridiculous"?

"Trolling game" Whaaaat?
Point in fact it is important who is behind this, yes. To suggest
otherwise is simply absurd, because "to find ways to beat it" it helps to
know where "it" comes from (this is basic, really).
So I would suggest you're Russian, due to how you reacted to my rational
suggestion Russia's behind this; okay, that's good to know, now I know
responding to you again is a total waste, because

Thanks for the clarification.
So, if this attack doesn't happen by say this coming Friday, are you
assuming it won't happen in the future?
Thanks for putting this out there

I wrote about this bug 4 days ago and no response on the bug tracker.
Where should I go to get attention to this major issue?
For some time (weeks) I haven't been able to use Thunderbird (before v30.*
When TorBirdy is installed and enabled Thunderbird won't load, so I have
to delete the TorBridy install file to get Thunderbird to load again.

Hello sir! :)
Okay, I will more details to the ticket now, thanks.
I just tried TorBridy 0.1.2 ( and it
works fine with Thunderbird 31.3.0. And I see there few changes for
TorBirdy v0.1.3
so maybe not too hard to figure out (hopefully).
Thanks for this, and thanks for TorBridy, and all the other great work you
