@_subject: Tor takes too much RAM 
Hi !
Oh, that was me :-)
I'm quite new to Tor and never ran a 0.1.1.x version. So I didn't know that
the current memory consumption is too high. Sorry for that.
I'll try.

@_subject: feedback about 0.2.0.6-alpha (r11277), traffic pattern and memory 
Hi !
I've "only" a 10 MBit connection but I do see this behaviour too (Tor
0.1.2.17 at the moment):
I usually restart Tor every 5 days when network utilization decreases due
to heavy swapping, see memory usage graph. But this strange traffic pattern
 repeats almost daily.

@_subject: Google becomes usefull for us again 
Hi !
Unfortunately they seem to block some Tor exit nodes too.
When I go to Scroogle via anonymizer.ccc.de I receive a "403 Forbidden"
error :-(
