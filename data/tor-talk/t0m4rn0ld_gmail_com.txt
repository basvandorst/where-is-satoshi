@_subject: Smallest cheapest device to run a tor home server? 
Hello Everone ( I am new ),
i love Tor and i want to contribute.
First of all does it make sense to run a tor relay on a ADSL line. I would
be willing to share 30-40kb a sec 24/7.
I have a linux WLAN router ( DD-WRT ) with 125 Mhz, 4 mb flash and 16 mb RAM
( 3 mb free ). Is that enough to run Tor?
( I didnt find any recent ipk packages .. so i guess it is not worth it
otherwise people would do it ... )
Would a 32 mb device with 200 mhz do the trick? Or what about the NSLU2 or
the Linkstation. Or is a used laptop the best choice?
So many questions :) ( BTW i didnt find any requirements on the homepage )
PS: sorry for asking, but i already asked on the german CCC list but didnt
get any definite answers.

Yes, Epia would certainly do the trick. I guess a 32mb router with 200 mhz
could do it too. The Slug (    ) seems to
work too.
But i think something more powerfull like the gigabit Linkstation (
 ) will certainly be enough to route
60 kb/sec ( 30 up and down ) .. why would TOR need more resouces??
I think i might get an old Pentium notebook with 64mb+ RAM or a Linkstation.
