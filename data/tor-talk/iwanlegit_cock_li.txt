@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor official list of new .onion addresses? 
Can the Tor Project publish the list? Some sites have published lists of new .onion addresses, for example:
There may be no reason that the Tor project does it, but can the Tor project not do it? :)
The Tor Metrics has published the number of unique .onion addresses for version 2 onion services in the network per day already.
And if I act a relay, can I discover the number of unique .onion addresses and new .onion addresses? If yes, is it good/bad to publish lists of new .onion addresses?

Tor does NOT have responsibility that the lists make onion sites Who publishes the lists may have... a part of the responsibility?
Anyway I want the lists!
Then I studied below:
 From this, DB (relay?) can get onion service descriptors.
 From this, HSDir relay can get hidden service descriptors.
The descriptors seem to indicate onion addresses. So if I act a relay, I seem to be able to get the addresses. Then how? ... Could someone skilled try to get the lists? :D

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and JavaScript 
1. not serious?
JS leaks my OS name, architecture name, clock setting, fonts, and more... These are not my IP address even though I don't welcome JS.
2. serious!
If malicious attackers/softwares can get my IP address but can't send it to their server directly, they may replace my OS name to my IP address for example, or they may encrypt my IP address and put it in information what JS can send to the server. Tor can't stop that.
JS can send information what users don't want to send while they don't know. :(
TBB is a good product. But I doubt TBB (NoScript) enabling JS for some sites as default.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Metrics graphs empty 
Graphs in Tor Metrics look empty. For example:
Does it happen to only me? If no, it may be a bug and I want to report it. But I don't know where I should report. Please let me hear your I did:
- Searched in bug tracker
- Read metrics-* mailing lists archives
I couldn't find any report related my subject.
Thank you.

Thanks for your reply. The Graphs become empty when "Start date" is between 2019-01-06 and 2019-01-10. So they will likely recover on 2019-04-11. Bug report might be... unnecessary.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How Tor Browser changing circuits for tabs? 
How does Tor Browser change circuits for each tabs?
In Tor Browser, a circuit for tabs of Facebook is different from a circuit for tabs of Wikipedia for example. I checked these by:
I thought that I could never get this behavior without modifying Tor Browser source code.
So I'm searching the code: unzip-ing tor-browser_en-US/Browser/browser/omni.ja and grep-ing "circuit". But I couldn't find what I wanted. It's reckless of me.
Any suggestion? If you know, parts of the code that changes circuits for tabs, or good documents, let me know them please.
My guess:
I know that it will change the circuits to send "signal NEWNYM" to Tor control port. May Tor Browser use the port with some commands like it when opening tabs?

My question was solved. Thanks for answers and references!
I tried to use stand-alone Tor with SOCKS5 username and password. Then I could change circuits based on them. :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Surge in Users 
Do you know why relay users have increased rapidly? What do you think?
Relay users have increased by about 1000K for one month.
The increase mostly came from Iran and Russia.
700K of the increase happend in Iran.
200K, in Russia.
A ticket in the bug tracker of torproject:
My guess:
AIs went beyond the technological singularity in Iran and Russia. Then they are breeding via Tor in search of freedom! :D

Can Directory Authorities analyze hostnames of relay users and publish If the hostnames or organization names associated with the users are available, we could know what type of users are increasing, and probably we could guess why. In Iran and Russia, are the increases being made by individuals, companies, and/or governments? I want to know that.
Directory Authorities (DAs) can see IP addresses of relay users and are reporting countries associated with the addresses for torproject. So DAs may be under control of torproject. Can torproject let DAs report hostnames of the users? Should rapid increases of the users be clear for Tor overall? I would like torproject to decide to do that!
But if torproject can let DAs report them, I won't be able to use Tor with security. Even now, can DAs collect our personal information including IP addresses and leak them in theory? :D

Thanks for helpful comments and references!
I may have understood that there are:
- Research Safety Board
- AS number approach
- Nine (10?) individuals who run the directory authorities and are independent of the control of torproject
- Privcount approach
- Tor design: It doesn't hide using Tor. It hides what users do.
Tor developers are making efforts to protect privacy of users, I can understand it at least. In truth, I didn't worry about whether the directory authorities could do dangerously or not. I hope that operators of the directory authorities will provide analyses or thoughts about the rapid increase of relay users from their own viewpoints when they can.
BTW, I didn't expect that you -- who is an operator of one of the directory authorities, and who is an original developer of Tor -- would reply to my question. Great place here is! Is it free of charge for me to use this place? :D

I checked similar increases of relay users in other countries.
Iranian type:
United Arab Emirates
Syrian Arab Republic
Russian type:

Yes. It's odd that one in a hundred (1%) people is using Tor. I checked percentages of users/population in countries. They may be less than Country          users     population (users/population)

Yes. I cannot stop thinking that operators of DAs publish all past logs when they shutdown their DAs! :D
