I might be missing the point, but why not doing it your self?
You already have a domain name, you would need to configure your own e-mail server, tor, AV, spam filtering  and so on....
If you use imap/smtp ... you also need to take in considaration the security of the client being used.
Why do you need imap and pop3?

I just did check.torproject.org and as far as I can tell, the site is working properly.
I'm using the same version as you are but Tor Browser for windows.

I'm trying to register to the "Tor bug tracker and wiki".
I'm using a screenreader, and I can't register because only a "visual
capcha" is provided on the following page:
Would it be possible to implement a way to allow users of screenreaders
to do the captcha on their own?

Tor Browser is accessible with a screenreader, how ever, beginning with
"TBB for Windows" 8.0 there is an issue that is being fixed:

The only help is to have sighted assistance!!! :)
The irony of it is that I can't even open a bug report about "trac"
being overzealous.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB 8.0 for Windows not accessible screenreader 
Beginning with TBB 8.0 for Windows I can no longer use it with my screenreader (1).
My screenreader is totally lost and makes TBB 8.0 unusable in this case.
Given that TBB 8.0 is focused on user I realy hope that all users will be able to continue using TBB.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hardened Debian Security Focused Distribution - 
Being able to do a fresh install of something that involve
"security/anonimity" is clearly welcome.
I don't feel comfortable installing some "security" on top of something
Will links2 be available?
Firewall capability would be nice.
Remote access to Hardent Debian.
Fully installable/usable using CLI.
Note that my comments are based on my understanding of Hardent Debian
which I understand to be a Debian distribution with security in mind.
P.S. My SMTP provider restrict the number of recipients I can send to.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Captcha verification fails when using "Get an audio 
Hello all,
I'm trying to verify a captcha by using "Get an audio challenge" but I
get the following:
"Try again later
Your computer or network may be sending automated queries. To protect
our users, we can't process your request right now. For more details

Latest version of TBB.
What can I do to work around this?

I thought that closing and then starting TBB would do it as well but I
managed to get it working using your approach.
Many thanks.
