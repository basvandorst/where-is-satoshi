@_subject: Question 
Hello everyone :)
I'm a computer science student studying Tor (if necessary I can send the
same mail from my official college mail). I have questions about Tor and the
types of services that use it (in the aspect of the reputation of Tor as a
security parameter). I'd like to talk to anyone from the dev team because
it's hard to get the accurate info from forums.
