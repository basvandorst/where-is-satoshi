Dear Nick,
I made an attempt to access Tor. The following error message came back. Platform Version '52.1.2 is not compatible with Mini Version >=45.9.0. Max Version <=45.9.0. How do I resolve this issue?

To the Tor Community Each time I logged on to check my email, Google automatically sets the account page to Spanish or German. Often I would go back to set the page to the correct setting, but it would revert to Spanish or German. I wish I could speak both language. What should I do? Thanks much.
Chris Williamson.

Dear Tor Community,
Tor seems to be defaulting at start up  and only seems to be loading at No Script. Whereas,  Firefox through DuckDuckGo seems to be storing websites visited even though you can delete these pages after visiting these sites. Looking forward to any meaningful response. Thanks much.
