@_subject: [tor-talk] Warning to TorBirdy users: system language leak in 
Hash: SHA512
Due to a change in Thunderbird's handling of the
"reply_header_authorwrote" prefs [1] TorBirdy users which use
Thunderbird 31 and later leak their system language to recipients* of
reply messages.
Usual TorBirdy quoting behaviour when composing a reply looks like
this (author name is not followed with "wrote"):
John Doe:
leak ("wrote" in the case of an English system) introduced with newer
Thunderbird versions:
Whether the system language is actually leaked depends on the content
of the email body. If the sender (you) manually remove the entire text
in the composing window - the "authorwrote" line is not included and
no leak occurs.
*) If the message has not been end-to-end encrypted this leak is not
limited to the intended recipients.
