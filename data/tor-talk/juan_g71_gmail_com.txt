Public relations, yes. I think the Tor community needs to strenghten its ties with big American firms like, say, Google, and especially with the American military. Tor people can stress the fact that Tor is used by the American military and that it helps them murder any kind of deviants who resist American rule (for instance, muslims).
        Now, I see that you are concerned about "informed consent". I'm wondering if you are then campaigning against so called social security, public education, taxes, and ultimately the state itself? I mean, if you're really worried about 'consent'...
        But maybe you are working on a more limited scope now, and you just want to stop parents indoctrinating 'their' children with religious garbage? Surely children are not giving "informed consent" when subjected to religious brainwashing...

        Sorry, but it seems to me that the 'promotion' of 'freedom' that the Tor project allegedly serves in places line china or iran is indeed part of the monolithic agenda of the US military.
        Notice that the US military/government is a police state spying on virtually all of the 'western' world. A 'threat model' that, oh surprise, the Tor network can't handle.

No worries. The real problem here is the apparent belief that calling people "tin foil hats" or accusing them of being 'conspiracy theorists' has any real weight in a real discussion.

But I didn't claim I discovered anything, and if you think I learned about Tor's history yesterday, you are mistaken.         The fact that I chose to comment on Tor's politics yesterday doesn't mean I haven't been aware of those issues for a (far) longer time...
        I'm also making the general point that Tor is not useful against 'nation states', which go figure, happen to be the biggest threats to freedom - especially the US state. Is that no news at all? It isn't. And yet it sems to me it needs to be underscored.
        Thanks for the Johnson pointer.                 I'm not sure if/why you're expecting technical help from me, or if it's a rhetorical trick along the lines of "either start coding or shut up"         Wrong exactly. The argument that I can't comment on what you do unless I run a multimillion sofware project (and 'better' than Tor) is invalid.
        And again the same pointless personal attack. Well, at least you didn't tell me to take my meds and fuck off.
        The thing is, I do not need to come up with better designs (that can't work anyway against serious adversaries), in order to take a look at what you do.
        For what it's worth : trying to have a diverse and big user base, and providing security for all users seems to be impossible. You either provide relatively good security for a small number of sensitive users, or relatively lax security for 'general' users.

Can they for instance pick a residential IP address from a city in japan or germany or thailand, and know what the user is doing? (downloading porn, chatting on irc...using Tor...etc).

order of magnitude: from over three months to only 1 day for a typ-

In that case, thanks for suggesting  I might be clueful in technical matters, but I'm sorry to disappoint you. I don't think I am.
        And basically, I think the problem that Tor attempts to solve is a political problem. Thus, it needs a political solution.
        I don't think my claim was unsuported. But let me try again.         Tor cannot protect individuals from organizations that can monitor 'big' parts of the internet. Organizations such as the US government, for instance. In that sense Tor is flawed.         I understand that the flaw is an inherent limitation of the way Tor works and it hasn't been put there 'on purpose'. But the fact remains, it is a bug, or feature, of Tor's design.
        I understand that the connections between Tor and the US military are public.         "it was designed by U.S. government employees and contractors based on technology invented by U.S. government employees."
        Right. That is public knowledge, but regardless of those facts being public, the implications are the same.         The US government is a criminal organization. The biggest on earth. It's a criminal organization even according to its own twisted standards - they pretend for instance that their  criminal spying activities are 'bound' by 'law' and restricted to so called 'national security'  but that is not the case.
        So the question remains. Why should Tor be trusted given its connections to such an organization as the US military and given how US 'moral' standards operate.
        And let me preempt you. The above criticism is pretty valid. Whether you consider it 'constructive' or not is up to you, but if you're interested in true free speech (among other things) you might want to think about the political side of the problem, not just the technical side.

I can't help but agree with the general idea - there's always a weakness. Still, I don't  think the remark is completely relevant if you are offering it as counterpoint to my comments about Tor.         Well, maybe it is a flaw in the general approach against surveillance? (which also includes Tor one way or another...)
        I could give you a hint, but if I did, your reply wouldn't be as interesting. Anyway, here it is. I get the impression that people try to brush off the connections between the US state and Tor. For instance, some clever fellow changed the topic of this thread to SPAM...
        So, what I would find 'satisfying' is a more serious analysis on that relationship.
        Yes, but I don't consider them an ally against surveillance. As you know, they are exactly the opposite.         Oh, sorry, that's sheer militaristic nonsense. The military and government are nothing but a parasite on civil society. Whatever they do is ultimately founded and relies on non-military research.

I'm not sure what 'ad hominems' you have in mind. Rather, I'm sure that what I'm saying isn't an 'ad hominem' at all.
        On the other hand,  I see that people who are skeptical of the Tor project have been called "conspiracy theorist" and accused of wearing 'tin foil hats'. I was asked if I was 'taking my meds' and politely asked to "fuck off". This thread's subject was at some point changed to "SPAM Re: [tor-talk] Tor and Financial Transparency".
        All that seems more in line with 'ad hominems' perhaps? You know the basic structure :  "What X says is invalid because X is a conspiracy theorist wearing a tin foil hat and he didn't take his meds!"         Oh, and to top it off, seems that you are suggesting below that I might be 'trolling'? Gee, that wouldn't be yet another ad-hominem would it.
        There's an interesting ambiguity here, it seems. First it's stated that onion routing doesn't protect against 'big' (in network terms) adversaries. But then no hard data is given about how 'big' the adversaries really are.         How well is Tor preserving the anonimity of its users? Well, there are "hard problems" to answer that question...
        I asked "Why should Tor be trusted", given its connections to a criminal organization.         That's not even an argument. It's basically a question. And seems like a pretty  reasonably question to me, by the way.
        You can even drop the bit about criminality if it upsets you.         Product X is meant to defeat one of the main objectives of the very company that manufactures  product X. Shouldn't the users of X take a closer look at what that means?         Indeed.
        But I don't think that's what I'm doing here.
        Well, here there seems to be a little fallacy...?
        "is _by design_ set up for (and thus receives)"         That would be a non-sequitur, I believe.         From "is setup for scrutiny" does not follow "it actually receives scrutiny" and it even less follows "it receives qualified scrutiny".
        "Unfortunately while OpenSSL is open source, it periodically coughs up vulnerabilities. "
        "We've also been saying that even open code like OpenSSL needs more expert eyes."
                I assume that what's true with respect to openssl is just as true with respect to Tor.

But I didn't say "there can be no adequate answer". What I'm saying is that given A and B, initial distrust is a rational response. I don't think this rational distrust can be described as an ad hominem.         And I can go further, I can say we have A, B, and so in this or that *particular case* there may be no adequate answer, or there is no adequate answer.         But fine. There isn't much point in keeping quarreling about the exact definition and usage of "ad hominem".
        And of course all that helps to dispell part of the distrust.
        I'm not sure I fully follow. And I'm surprised by something that looks like an appeal to 'group thinking'? Sorry, I can't find a better word for this         "valid argument as recognized by the group"
        I'm not sure what standard for discussion you're advocating, but what I seem to understand is that if I don't stick to your standard(whatever that is), then I'm trolling?
`       But, all right. No point in engaging in endeless discussion about the meaning of 'trolling' either.
        Yes. I took a quick look at it first and asked how those results affected hidden services, but I didn't get an answer.
        I've now read it thoroughly. The use of an internet map and circuit simulator is interesting. So, after something like ten years, there's an analysis that tries to get a complete and quantified picture of the system. Better late than never, I guess.         Maybe in 2002 the assumption that the internet was too big and complex for it to be succesful monitored was correct, but that assumption doesn't look too valid now?         I'm not denying it's a hard problem. And it's a hard problem that doesn't help Tor's reputation since it makes it hard to know how well Tor is performing. But you knew that.
        Even if I drop the composition, the picture is still odd. Organization M has the goal of spying on every 'foreign' living soul. Organization M starts and mostly funds project X that goes against M's goal. Something is off.         But, OK. You are of course free to use your time in whatever way you feel it's appropriate.         Yes, I see that. I must admit I mostly got a fair hearing from you.
        And that makes it easier for people to audit the system and so the audit is more likely to happen, I see that.
        Anyways, thanks for the discussion.
