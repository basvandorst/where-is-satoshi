Hash: SHA1
Mir Hossein Mousavi, former presidential candidate during the 2009
elections and leader of the Green Movement under illegal house arrest
for approximately 18 months, was transferred to a cardiac hospital in
down town Tehran under extreme security measures accompanied by his
wife Zahra Rahnavard.
526 days after his illegal house arrest, Mir Hossein Mousavi who was
reportedly suffering from extreme chest pain was reportedly
transferred this morning, Thursday August 23rd, 2012, under extreme
security measures to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) at a cardiac
hospital in central Tehran. It has been reported that security agents
arrived at the hospital the night before Mousavi?s transfer,
installing security cameras throughout the hospital.
According to the same reports the security apparatus assigned to Mir
Hossein Mousavi and his wife Zahra Rahnavard at the hospital includes
tens of IRGC agents, security agents and plain clothes officers. The
hospital personnel working in the unit where Mousavi has been
admitted, have not been allowed to leave the building and Mousavi is
said to be banned from all visitation.
It has been reported that as a result of a blocked coronary artery,
Mousavi under went a three hour angiogram. Upon completion of the
operation, Mousavi was transferred back to the CCU unit where he is
likely to remain for a longer period of time.
In the event that Mousavi?s hospitalization is prolonged, there is
speculation that he will be kept in isolation in a separate unit in
the hospital.

@_subject: [tor-talk] HTTPS to hidden service unecessary? 
Tor will encrypt your data while it's being passed from one relay to the
other, all the way to the Exit node. If you send HTTP, it will come out
HTTP :)
By TLS?  So if running a hidden service, is it redundant to serve it
using HTTPS/port 443??
Hidden Services are a special case, everything inside a hidden service
is end to end encrypted. So as long as the hidden service and the Web
Service are on the same machine I guess you can get away with not
installing SSL on the web service.
I used to setup my hidden services with SSL on the web port and when I
realized this it was very pleasant :)

[ EU / Blocking / TOR ]
European Commission net neutrality consultation excludes TOR users
Brussels, 23 July 2012 -- The European Commission blocks TOR users'
access to its web site. TOR is an internet anonymisation technology and
became widely popular for its facilitating role in the Arab spring movement.
"This is ironic, the Commission is conducting a public consultation on
net neutrality, and they already censor a part of the internet to access
their site", finds FFII President Benjamin Henrion. He was troubled by
the issue when he tried to access the consultation website from European
Commissioner Neelie Kroes.
"The European Commission is seeking answers to questions on specific
aspects of transparency, traffic management and switching in an Open
Internet", the website says. But TOR users receive a less inviting
message: "Network Error (gateway_error) Server overloaded. The gateway
may be temporarily unavailable, or there could be a network problem."

Finally after years of waiting we will get to see what a so called
"Halal Internet" looks like. So far they have completed "Phase One"
which is to disconnect all the governmental entities from Gmail and
other foreign services.
Next phase is to do the same with the entire population of Iran. It is
hard for me to imagine the Internet getting completely shutdown. I
suspect they will make SSL traffic very slow to a point that users would
give up and look for other alternatives....
Today, Iran started to block Gmail at different ISP and cities all over
Iran. The head of the unit that is in charge of blocking said that
"Because of the release of an anti-islam videos about prophet Muhammad
on Youtube, which is owned by Google, *The People* have asked for these
sites to be blocked! So we have decided to Block Google and Gmail
service until further notice."

You cam lock down your .onion using this feature:
HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient auth-type client-name,client-name,?
If configured, the hidden service is accessible for authorized clients
only. The auth-type can either be 'basic' for a general-purpose
authorization protocol or 'stealth' for a less scalable protocol that
also hides service activity from unauthorized clients. Only clients that
are listed here are authorized to access the hidden service. Valid
client names are 1 to 19 characters long and only use characters in
A-Za-z0-9+-_ (no spaces). If this option is set, the hidden service is
not accessible for clients without authorization any more. Generated
authorization data can be found in the hostname file. Clients need to
put this authorization data in their configuration file using HidServAuth.
As far as getting a linux box with SSH, there are already some good
recommendations in this email thread.
