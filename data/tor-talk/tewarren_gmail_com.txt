@_subject: How can I trust all my Tor nodes in path 
Maybe you could answer a question for me. Should I NOT login in to a site,
such as a bank, when using Tor? Or do I need to make sure it is https:?
Appreciate any clarification.

Thank you, just trying to make sure I understand. I will also follow that

Greetings. I am new here. What brought me here is the inability to run Tor
on my main WinXP pro system. While loading an error dialog popsup stating
"Tor has encountered an error and must quit". What are some reasons that
would cause Tor to crash? This is a very clean, stable system with no other
problems, that I am aware of. I have used Tor on another system with no
problems. Any suggestions either solving this problem or where to find
answers would be appreciated.
Thank you,

The latest stable release 0.1.1.25 from the the Tor DL page.*
*What processes? Nothing unusual, reformatted and reinstalled not long ago.
It is fully patched and up to date WinXP Pro SP2 system. I have been trying
to keep what loads at startup, etc to a minimum.
Originally it ran the first time just fine, but afterwards is when the
problem started. I also once tried Torpark and the exact thing happened, Tor
would error.
Tor tries to start, the error dialog popsup stating Tor needs to quit, but
it is shown to keep running in Task Manager.
Appriciate ANY ideas.

I will try that, again. Firewall? Yes I am running Keiro. The error seems to
be very early when Tor is starting up. The first and only time it worked
there was not a problem with the firewall.
