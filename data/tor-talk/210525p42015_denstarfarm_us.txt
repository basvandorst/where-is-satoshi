Hello Tor-Talk,
I noticed that in alpha 4-2 I could retain passwords on sites.
Once I switched to Alpha 4-3 I could not.
So I switched back to version 2; did the appropriate Configs, under
options, then and repeated the aforementioned.
Whether by design or error, Alpha 4-2.0 can not retain P/W

Yes, fine there as well as alpha 2
Just thought I'd ping someone who is working on builds in case nobody
had noticed.
thanks reply
