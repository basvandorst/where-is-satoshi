I wholeheartedly disagree. Not only do jurisdictions have very  different and specific laws, even the definition of terms such as  hacking and child exploitation/pornography differ dramatically. For  reference, see But even _if_ there were a globally accepted standard of what is  definitely illegal everywhere, implementing a set of filters is a very  bad move. As soon as you have a technology to filter based on content,  people will start adding other "obviously bad" stuff on the list to  filter. Your result is a system in which censorship is easily possible.

I think that this really blocks Tor. Tor currently uses IP addresses  to connect to other nodes, if you're behind a proxy that disallows  such connections, Tor will be effectively blocked. I see the possible  solution of a proxy chain or a tunnel to a server without using it's  IP address directly.
Have you tried such an approach?

Hash: SHA1
No, you should turn it off. Having those statistics doesn't add any  value to the Tor network, you cannot even make broad statements like  "30% of all traffic in Tor goes to xy.com", because you see only a  tiny fraction and the real usage is likely to be entirely different -  think about how different exit policies etc come into play. Generally,  it's always recommended to not log unless you have a reason (for  example a bug you're trying to find).
The less verbose your logs are, the less likely it is someone will  find them interesting and makes you give them out. This applies to the  whole community of relay operators - if it is a well-known fact that  most of them log, adversaries might become more persuasive when they  ask for logs.
Generally, Tor exit nodes must always be assumed to be malicious, but  this of course doesn't mean that once it's a proven fact that an exit  is malicious, it will be excluded.
So, a personal question: What is your motive? Do you feel you have a  right to know what people are doing? Because this is where the ice  gets really thin...

Tor is _not_ just about hiding who you are to a service provider, but  also about hiding where you go from a local observer (your ISP, other  people on the same network, etc). Also, access of blocked services  certainly is a big aspect here. Same goes for hidden services - I  might be the only person who knows the address of my hidden service,  and it's still a valid use case.

Hash: SHA1
The problem with Ubuntu can be followed by reading In short: Tor provides working Ubuntu packages in the noreply  repositories, so users can simply use those to get working, up-to- date, secure versions. Because Tor is in Ubuntu Universe, no security  updates are provided by Ubuntu itself, meaning that Ubuntu used to  ship remote-root vulnerable versions of Tor for a long time, even  though they were informed about the problem and could simply have  adopted the packages from noreply. As it stands, I personally deem any  package in Ubuntu universe as a great risk to anyones computer  security, since updates are not provided in a timely manner. That  being said, I'm very happy with the current situation (Tor being  removed from Ubuntu, while users can install packages from noreply  without any trouble to get the latest version of Tor).

@_subject: Reducing relays = reducing anonymity ? Tortunnel. 
Hi Niklas,
This works by pretending to the exit relay that you've already come
through the Tor network. This is considered abusing the resources
made available to the Tor network by volunteers, and effectively
entirely breaks your anonymity.
The only goal of tortunnel is speed. Remember, though, that most
nodes on the Tor network aren't exits, so even for the network as a
whole tortunnel, is a bad idea as exit capacity is tapped by more
people (assuming the people who use tortunnel would otherwise
find something else that offers speed but no anonymity).
Remember that not only the exit node, but also people who might
want to threaten/watch the exit node or its operator are perfectly
able to track you down and analyze all your traffic as much as
they want.
Yes, quite many people do, unfortunately. We have implemented
a patch to detect people who abuse Tor in this way, and exit node
operators using the development version can already opt to deny
handling traffic for tortunnel users. As this option gets more testing
it will propagate into the stable versions and probably be turned
on by default before too long.
Yes, unfortunately quite a few people use it.
It hurts the network by endangering exit node operators, and
by completely ignoring any of the load balancing that happens
in normal Tor.
Anonymity is entirely gone.
No, because Tor itself identifies as a client to the first hop. This
means that the first hop knows that you are a client, and
disallows exiting.
One thing you fail to consider is how secure tortunnel itself is.
Others have reported it is doing some dubious things, and it
wouldn't come as a big surprise if there were a nice bugdoor

To indicate that a line ends in the torrc but Tor should treat

block are ignored.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor - 1-click-compile-version 
All Tor developers that have voiced their opinion on the matter of
backdoors state that they would never put in a backdoor, and personally
I would immediately quit the project if any evidence was produced that
such a backdoor was implemented/is about to be implemented. This is not currently possible, because the builds are not deterministic
[0]. So, nobody except the release engineer knows how the binary was
built exactly.
This is pretty plainly wrong. Tor uses a set of currently 8 directory
authorities (I operate one of them, gabelmoo), and uses them to
bootstrap. Blocking them all is easy, and prevents bootstrapping for Tor
clients that aren't using bridges, but if a bridge is available they are
not required for bootstrapping purposes. If a sufficient number of them
are compromised, an adversary can do bad stuff like skew the popularity
of a relay or prevent a relay from joining/add a relay that isn't really
online, etc. Unless a majority of them are hijacked it is very hard to
pull off those attacks unnoticed, tho.

I feel that your insults are entirely uncalled for here. Running a relay
from a home connection is perfectly fine if there's enough spare
bandwidth. There is absolutely nothing wrong with doing just that, and I
am thankful to every operator who sets up a good node.

This code has been inside Tor since 2008, and propagated from
0.2.1.3-alpha to 0.2.1 and then into 0.2.2 (which the authorities are
running). I'm not sure where you read about a requirement for
dirauths to run different versions, if this ever existed it sure hasn't
been the case for at least a few years.
Non-authorities aren't affected by this bug.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor 0.2.3.1-alpha is out! 
Tor now has a build-time option to optionally include a helper script that
has upnp and/or nat-pmp functionality. This helper script further needs to
be enabled by setting a Tor configuration option (PortForwarding) to
enable the feature at runtime.
When that option is set on a build that supports it, and the router
supports and is configured to allow upnp configuration, only then will
automatic port forwarding be attempted.
It is my general recommendation to always disable upnp everywhere,
but that's beside the point here.

Nobody said anything about withdrawing support because of this. Note
that Jake spoke of suspicion. Recommending against the use of Operating
Systems that have reached their end of life and no longer have security

surprise you at all?
By just reading the articles you linked to above, you will see that
MS claims the attack is fixed in the most recent version of Windows XP.
You don't provide any kind of evidence that it is still a problem on
those systems.
It's not entirely clear what the implications are, from what I understand.
Maybe that is because you demand a fully qualified answer within six
hours, while you fail to provide a good bug report? Typically, bugs
get reported to  where the developers
actually expect them.
Here's the reply from someone on the tor dev team: "Exciting! It seems
you've found a bug on Windows 2000 systems, we should totally debug that
and see if we can get it fixed! Unfortunately, we don't have a windows
2000 system around to debug this ourselves, and this is the only report
we've gotten about trouble so far. Please try and provide more input
about your system, the other software that you run, and if you have any
experience debugging software so we may help you get this issue
If we have to conclude that the expert Bundle doesn't work on Windows
2000 anymore for whatever reason, I'm afraid we'll have to drop support
for it unless someone else steps in to provide the necessary fixes."

Hey Jim,
your suggestion does indeed appear reasonable, and I had actually
prepared such an addition to the download page when we learned
that this bug is not windows 2000 specific at all. It can hit people who
use all versions of Windows, but by far doesn't hit most of them.
So it is in fact false that this is specifically a bug with support for
win2k, and rather it's a general bug that we're hoping to solve. We've
had some help from someone experiencing the issue, but details are still
a bit in the dark. Hopefully we'll have a patch out soon.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Suggestion: make _hidden services_ choose random 
Unfortunately, you got it all wrong. There's a trivial attack against any
hidden service that doesn't use entry guards: Make a lot of connections
to it, while running at least one relay. Then do some timing analysis to
see when your connection to the hidden service coincides with a
connection to the node that you control, and write down the IP address
of the person making the connection, and you have de-anonymized
the hidden service.
If you have 200 bad entry nodes under your control, that attack will
work very quickly and reliably, whereas there's still a good chance
that you need to keep those nodes running for a few months for the
hidden service to pick one of those nodes as guard.

@_date: 2011-10-22 14:50:15
@_author: Sebastian Hahn 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Suggestion: make _hidden services_ choose 
This assumption is wrong. Just making a single connection is enough
for timing analysis, and that means if you ever choose a bad node -
whether that's a guard node or not - you've already lost.
I hope the above made it clearer?

You can set the ShutdownWaitLength tor configuration option to something

@_subject: [tor-talk] The Tor network doesn't support Named relays anymore 
Dear Tor users,
the system for naming relays has been an issue for a long time.
Referring to a relay by the operator-chosen nickname in your Tor
configuration file was never a great idea if you wanted to rely on Tor
using that specific relay. As a band-aid, the Tor directory authorities
implemented a naming system, where one of the flags they gave to relays
which picked a unique nickname, stuck with it for a while, and didn't go
offline for more than half a year, was the "Named" flag. This meant
relying on the dirauths for one more thing, and added complexity for the
dirauth operators.
To rectify the situation, proposal 235[0] was written to evaluate the
possibility of stopping the naming system. The tor-dev thread that
followed lead to a code review to ensure currently running versions of
Tor won't be adversely affected by consensuses without any Named flags.
The result of the analysis is that no such issue could be found, and
we're proceeding with disabling Naming. Please note that this does not
mean you cannot use the "Nickname" field anymore when setting up a
If you - in your Tor configuration file - refer to any relay by name and
not by identity hash, please change that immediately. Future versions of
Tor will not support using names in the configuration at all.
Please report any issues that you might find, so we can react
Thanks & Cheers

@_subject: [tor-talk] [tor-consensus-health] Consensus issues 
Hi Sebastian,
thanks for looking after the network!
Here's an easy theory on what might have happened: When it was time to
vote, tor26 made a vote, and distributed it to the other dirauths. When
it was done doing so, it went offline. The other dirauths made a
consensus, and signed it. tor26 came back online, learned that there was
a consensus it didn't know about, fetched it from the other dirauths,
but didn't sign it - because the time to sign it was in the past. This
does not constitute an error condition for tor26, because enough other
dirauths signed it for it to be considered valid.
I'd argue against increasing the complexity of the voting process to
handle this rare edge case. I do think maybe the wording is confusing:
What does "Consensus belonging to" mean? A consensus doesn't belong to
any individual dirauth. I don't have a quick suggestion for what to
name the notice instead, tho.
Yes, gabelmoo was down as I was fixing its bw auth. Nothing to worry
about indeed.

This means that for the reported period of time, the directory authority
gabelmoo, which I maintain, recommended more versions for use than the
other versioning directory authorities. This happened because the
decision to change the recommended versions was made while I was asleep,
and I've only fixed it for the upcoming consensus in a few minutes.
So the message is harmless.
The idea is to recommend all versions which aren't known to be bad, so
that an operator who reads their Tor logs will realize their Tor really
needs to be upgraded in order to remain secure/operational when theysee
it. So, if an -rc version is fine to use, we can keep recommending it.
