That's interesting. I haven't tried this myself, but I would imagine
it may have to do with the way that craigslist generates their pages.
I could be very wrong, but I think that they're regularly generating
static pages to be served rather than making them dynamically.
For example, if you're searching for a popular term or watching a
popular category, the page for a search only seems to get updated
every 15 - 20 mins at which point several new entries will show up.
Maybe posts created from tor exit nodes are flagged in this automatic
page regeneration?
