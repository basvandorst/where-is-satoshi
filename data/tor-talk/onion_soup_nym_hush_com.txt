The figure almost doubles in the whole December. These extra usages disappears after that. Does anyone know what happens?

if there is no clear explanation account for the doubling of the usage figure in the whole December, i would speculate that this is an error in the estimation. could anyone confirm this?

@_subject: Tor relay security 
I come across How to Run a Secure Tor Server at: ty and have some questions I could not get answers on my own, limited by my knowledge.
1. The article talks about encrypting sensitive information on a Tor server. Does the author mean that files on hard disk are obtainable by other Tor users when I run a Tor relay? How likely is that going to happen? What platforms are more vulnerable in this 2. I noticed there are key files found on machines running as Tor relays. But I get no idea how do they come into place. Are they generated automatically when I configure my Tor as a relay? as a client? And do I get a new key each time or does it ever expire? The article talks about safeguarding the key. I read that Tor employs asymmetric key so I suppose that key is my private key. If that key is compromised, does this (a)reduce the entry node's certainty about whether the packets are originated from me and (b)allow anyone with that key to decrypt packets destined to me from entry node?

@_subject: configure Tor to advertise its orport as 443 but really bind to another port such as 9001 
using debian 5
i followed this: i did three things:
1. set "orport 443" and "orlistenaddress 0.0.0.0:9001" in torrc file
2. Similarly, "dirport 80" and "dirlistenaddress 0.0.0.0:9030"
3. lastly, in rc.local, i added "ssh -fNL 443:localhost:9001 localhost" and "ssh -fNL 80:localhost:9030 localhost"
and i configure my Tor as a bridge. but the bridge address vadilia gives me is with 9001 port. should i be expecting a 443 port on my bridge address instead?
or do i misconfigure?
please help.

Does anyone know if China is currently blocking Tor? Does the situation described below persist?
