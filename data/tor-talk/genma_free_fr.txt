Hi All,
I've discover the apt-transport-tor project (
see  and I've got a
question: what's the difference between apt-transport-tor and a
command-line such "torrify apt-get". I've send an email to the
developper of this project and I'm waiting for an answer.
Maybe someone can answer/help me to understand, it will be helpfull.
I notice the project documentation doesn't not insist on the fact that
in the /etc/apt/sources.list the url need to be httpS to be sure that
the downloaded package are not compromized. Any other comments/critics?
I'm preparing a text for my own blog in French, Le Blog de Genma and
I'd like to investigate this project before writing my text.
