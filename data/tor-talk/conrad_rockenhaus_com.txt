@_subject: [tor-talk] Thoughts on Tor-based social networking? 
Hi Bill,
Your email actually kind of intrigued me and I just wanted to comment
on some of your points...
You'll be surprised at the battles within the US Government, mainly
the US Military/Intelligence Community about TOR.  As a Communications
guy in the Navy, my job was (yes, past tense) develop solutions for
communications privacy, plausible deniability, etc. and quite a few of
them utilized TOR, and there's a huge core of TOR supporters within
the community that support TOR, including the free speech aspects,
completely... of course, none of us are the Intelligence types.
Then you have the Intelligence Community, who, going out on a limb
here, doesn't value privacy.  They feel technologies such as TOR are
only for nefarious purposes.  I mean no one needs anonymity anymore,
So, in a nutshell - you have a clash of two worlds here - you have
people within the US Government that actively support TOR and believe
in it and you have the people that feel that it's one of the evil
things and would love that technologies such as it and perhaps even
SSL didn't exist.  Just my $0.02 on that topic about it.
I'm not sure about the hackers, but I'll tell you this much - it is a
super-hard issue to maintain an exit-node, especially in the United
States, and not run into any legal issues.  I previously ran a TOR
exit node...I don't anymore, because said exit node is still in the
custody of NCIS, which is funny as during my interrogation about the
TOR exit node, I did explain that my job in the Navy extensively
technologies such as TOR and I was attempting to promote free speech
and privacy.  I was quickly corrected about the subject per the above
discussion about the two differing views about TOR.
Thankfully, due to the way TOR is configured no user data was
compromised.  They had a simple FreeBSD box.  Whoopee.  However, it's
situations like these that I'm thankful that traffic isn't audited or
sniffed or anything, because the ramifications of that could have been
very serious for many people after the box was seized.
I guess, what I'm basically trying to say - it's a hard balance
between the two.  When you're providing an opportunity for free speech
with the possibility of no consequences (for the end user), there
might be a bonehead or two who's going to potentially abuse it, but
when you start with logging and auditing, you're providing an
opportunity for a third party to compromise someone who really doesn't
need to be compromised.

Well, there's a way to get this done, but it's not a *nix based
solution.  You can utilize ISA Server, Microsoft Exchange, and the
Socksv4 firewall client.  Use the ISA Server to centrally connect to
Tor, use the Socksv4 client to let Microsoft Exchange connect via
socks to the client.  It's something I'm willing to try out and see if
it works if anyone wants to know the results of such test, but I'm
pretty sure this type of solution should work.

If you have it laying around, I'm interested.  Would you mind
uploading it to GitHub or emailing it to me so I can upload it to
GitHub (credits to you of course.) so we can work on it some more.
Would rather use anything other than Windows.
I'm going to experiment with the Windows though, just to see if it
works or not.  I'll get y'all posted.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Graypony 
Hello Tempest,
Basically Greypony has been mostly configured, but I'm running into
some issues doing transparent proxying with Postfix and the edge MTAs.
 I don't want to store any of the mailboxes on the edge MTAs at all.
All of the mailboxes must be stored on Tor in order to assure security
and anonymity of sources.  I'm hoping that the code that Lunar has
that Ruby code that'll allow the configuration of using querying DNS
via TCP to prevent DNS leaks outside of Tor.
Of course, if anyone has any suggestions, I'm more than open to them,
please - I would like to consider this a group effort.
For those who don't know - Greypony  is a Tor
based hidden email solution that allows users on Tor to send emails to
the public Internet from within the Tor network, send emails to other
Tor users, and allows public Internet users to send emails to Tor
users.  The goal for the service is to have built in GPG encryption,
IMAP, webmail, and all sorts of other goodies.
The Internet facing MTAs (the MTAs on the Public Internet) just run a
MTA, do not perform any logging whatsoever, and just forward emails to
the Tor dataserver.  The opposite occurs, the Tor dataserver sends an
email to the MTA and it forwards it on the the Public Internet.
Again, no logging is performed on the Tor dataservers either.  There's
no way to recover passwords on the dataservers.
Preferred authentication would be Certificate based authentication
(certificated would be generated) and again, GPG would be used to
ensure proper security.
If there's any suggestions, or any questions, please let me know.

@_subject: [tor-talk] tordns incapable of MX lookups (was Basics of secure 
Basically, the reason why Windows was brought up in the discussion was
due to the fact that ISA Server has a SOCKS4/5 client that will allow
client computers (including MS Exchange) to connect to the ISA, which
can be configured to route everything through Tor.  That's all.  I'm
not sure of any *nix compatible proxying server that would allow a MTA
to connect to a SOCKS4/5 server.  That's all.  Of course, I could
could be wrong and would love to hear other ideas on this concept.

Thanks. The service that I'm starting up is connecting to external mtas
that aren't tor exit nodes.  So basically, the way tormail was set up to a
degree. Starting out small until so I can prove the viability so people
will start using and hopefully donating either bandwidth or etc to keep it
There's going to be one major difference between this project and tormail
though - the data/web backend won't be in one place. More on that later,
I'm trying to get the proof of concept off the ground.

@_date: 2013-09-17 17:45:33
@_author: Conrad Rockenhaus 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Help with getting a good automated sign up script 
That's exactly what I'm doing with this project.
Internet<---->MTAs(Just running Postfix with ABSOLUTELY no logging) also
running TOR as a (client only)<------>Data Server(Running as Hidden Service
only, no logging)<----->TOR End User
Basically, to the normal Internet, it will just be a plain jane email
address that is coming from a plain jane MTA.  The MTAs will not know the
IP address of the data servers because they will only deliver the email via
TORified SMTP to the data server.
Of course, standard SPAM limiting measures will be in place (limits on
number of addressees in a message, limits on how many messages can be sent
per minute, per hour, etc.)
Now I've got the MTAs, I'm just perfecting the configuration and trying to
figure out a good domain name to use for the service (I would rather not
use networks.rockenhaus.com, which is the placeholder for now.)  I also
need to come up with a secondary domain name in case people start blocking
emails from the domain.
I'm funding the initial proof of concept.  What I'll be asking for is
either a honor system payment (so those who can't afford to pay can still
use the service) or a donation based model, and also try to fund the
service with tor based web hosting (which I doubt will bring in any needed
cash) and ask for donations of bandwidth and servers.
The primary main objective, heh, is to ensure a failsafe system to provide
freedom of expression, freedom of government intrusion, and freedom of
ensuring access to an experimental anonymous email system that won't turn
over anything on it's servers, as if authorities seize MTAs, they won't
find any evidence on there, and if they seize a data server, there's
another data server standing by to automatically fail over (not putting the
eggs in one basket like tormail.)  The only lines of compromise are
sniffing the traffic in the MTAs, most TOR users are capable of utilizing
encryption for their emails anyway.
Sorry for the long response.  I just wanted to paint a picture of how it
would work.
Now, for those who are curious about a guy who appeared out of no where and
started building this - I've been lurking for a while, and I didn't want to
say anything until I had the resources to build this.  If you want further
information about me please feel free to contact me and I'll let you know
who I am and why I am very pro free speech and pro tor, even when it's used
to personally attack me.

The development servers are in separate jurisdictions throughout the world.
 For the initial proof of concept, I have two MTAs and two Data Servers,
with one spare server.  Each one is in a separate jurisdiction to make it
more difficult to tap.  I won't go into details, but let's just say that
the United States wasn't an option for the Data Servers.  I may consider
the US for MTAs in the future...

I have researched the ownership and governmental cooperation of each
company I have chosen and there's also a specific reason why I've
chosen some companies.  The MTAs are not as worrysome as the data
servers are, but the data servers will have drive level encryption,
partition level encryption, and file level encryption - so yes, the
NSA can beat three levels of encryption, but they can't beat an
emergency track low level format (if we have that much warning.)
There's other fail safe systems that I would rather not disclose
publicly that protect the data from the prying eyes of government,
that I personally know will be effective in preventing any
Intelligence Community organization from obtaining anything from the
data servers.  If you want to discuss certain aspects of this please
email me off the list.

@_author: Rock 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Help with getting a good automated sign up script 
Hash: SHA1
I'll gladly disclose the systems - I want to be be as transparent as
possible, as I feel that was one of the major faults of tormail was
the lack of transparency which led to it's downfall, as we saw when we
realized that it was brought down as it was all completely hosted on
one sole source, Freedom Hosting.
That will be the fail safe - this project isn't solely hosted.  The
plan is once the proof of concept, by that once I make sure that my
code works and the team works and and users are pleased with the
service and people are happy with the transparency, and we're
providing a valuable service to ensure the ability for others to have
freedom of expression, freely, especially from areas where it's
restricted, without fear of reprisal or fear of someone providing
their information to a governmental source, which hopefully there will
be enough volunteers to ensure that these services are adequately
At this point though the backup location isn't ready for for complete
configuration - I only have the certificates for the VPN between the
two sites configured and I'm still working on the the failsafe code
basically, honestly, it's not security through obscurity, it's just
the need to complete the actual code to ensure that physical site A is
taken offline, then physical site B will come online with the same
hash hostname.
So basically, the final design will be as follows, mtas will deliver
be configured to deliver to both all of the data servers (we will
start off with at least two sites), but only one data server will be
the primary data server at a time.  That primary data server will
mount the other ones remotely via a vpn connection and have the db
constantly written to the secondaries.  If the primary goes doe down,
one of the secondaries will take over.  If for some reason, the
hostname is considered "compromised" (such as a primary server being
seized by a governmental organization and replaced), the hostname of
the next secondary will start being used.  Such a change will be
propagated via Social Media and other means.  But any way, the nice
ascii graph.
Internet---------MTAs---------Primary Data Server---------tor users
                  |
                  |
                  |

                  |
                Secondaries--(OpenVPN)
                tor users
There's some already coded solutions that I'm looking into that I just
want to make sure work with tor hidden services.  There's also some
solutions that people smarter than me on this list probably know about
that hopefully may share with me.
The way the service is set up will be documented.  The other team
member and I will be actively documenting everything and ensuring that
we have everything documented and again, as transparent as possible.
For this little project I hope plenty of people volunteer, plenty of
people participate in a open provide feedback and ideas because you
know what, I might have ideas, I might have solutions, but I'm sure
someone might have something better.
Thanks for your feedback!

- -An email service that supports the the freedom of expression.

Good God every conversation, now. Anyway.
This exit isn’t bad exit material. Turkey has been known to block Tor though, I’m actually proud of this guy for having the cajones (also known as balls to those of you who don’t habla espanol) to operate an exit in country such as Turkey, which absolutely hates freedom inducing technologies such as Tor. Let’s give this guy (or gal) the atto-boy by marking the exit as a bad-exit just because stuff gets blocked in autocratic regimes that this operator has no control over. None, absolutely none. They screw with the DNS servers over there, that’s why during the last uprising they were tagging “8.8.8.8” on the walls.
Now they’re doing things a little more sophisticated. Either way, this guy gives us a window to see what is blocked and what isn’t blocked within the Turkish thunderdome.

As you notice I never mentioned any pricing or anything like that. That’s probably because I intend on introducing the service to the community as a public service. This isn’t a commercial offering, this is a solicitation to test a new public service that we’re trying to offer the community.

After an email exchange with Iain, I will admit that I did approach this somewhat wrong given the nature of this mailing list. What I should of done is discuss the architecture of the solution and provided an opportunity for input and the feasibility of the solution prior to seeking users to try it out. I will do that in separate correspondence. For failing to discuss the architecture first with the group, I apologize, I just wanted to keep the note short because I didn’t want to sound like I was advertising.
To note - I am not providing this service as a commercial service. I am providing this as a free service to benefit the Tor community. It has been a goal of mine to provide VoIP/XMPP/SMS services to the Tor community for some time now, and I intend to provide them as a community service. The only things that will be charged for is if a user wants direct dial access to the outside world (because I have to pay a telecom company) or if a user wants voicemail capability. I think that’s fair to charge for those two items.
In reference to my government ties, I served in the US Navy. I was a communications specialist. I was medically retired. My present connection to the government is I receive retirement pay and I am subject to the UCMJ because I receive said retirement pay… therefore I would say my present connection is I only care if my pay comes in on the 1st, otherwise, don’t care. I became interested in Tor because I actually had an opportunity to use Tor while on Active Duty while in the course of my duties. I worked in communications, I cared about computers and radios and didn’t really care about intelligence. I don’t care about your data but I care about protecting it. The fact that I served in the Navy shouldn’t be concerning as lots of people have served in the military. I would say that the military experience truly opened my eyes to what the Constitution really says about Free Speech and the protection thereof.
I sincerely appreciate your email and I hope people actually give me a chance and work with me on this project instead of attacking me because I also run a commercial enterprise. All I am trying to do is help the Tor community. GreyPony hosts 18 Tor Relays, we are in the process of obtaining our own ASN and IPv4 and IPv6 net blocks from ARIN since we are now multi homed, and we’ve transitioned our cloud environment to a high availability environment all just to better support the Tor community. I don’t make a profit at all, but I continue to do this because all I want to do is help increase Tor network diversity and capacity.

What’s your point? Yeah, I personally support two relays, but I provide

I’m personally helping out with AS diversity by ordering an interconnect
from Level 3 to justify a ASN and IPv4 and IPv6 address space from ARIN so
GreyPony can provide services on a unique AS, improving the quality of our
exits and relays.
Now I’m trying to start a free VoIP, Telepresence, and IM service that has
the ability to access the public phone network and do cool things like save
voicemails and such. I do these things because I actually care about Tor
and it’s users. Did I mention that this service is free, unless you want to
dial outside the switch?

Hello All,
So prior to opening up the service for beta, Iain suggested that we have a
discussion regarding my proposed service and my planned architecture to see
if there’s any room for improvements in the design or any vulnerabilities
that can take away someone’s anonymity.
So the design is pretty simple, I have an Asterisk box, and in front of
that Asterisk box I have a FreeBSD box that is running Tor, SSHD, and
OpenVPN. SSHD and OpenVPN are exposed as hidden services via Tor. The Tor
user connects to Asterisk via a passwordless OpenVPN or SSH tunnel to route
UDP traffic to Asterisk.
Asterisk is connected to Internet to allow interconnection with VoIP
providers, termination with with users that don’t care about anonymity, as
well as interconnection with other XMPP servers.
SMS is enabled, it requires an email address. If you don’t have a reliable
Tor accessible email address, we’re working on a solution.
Any comments/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

2)	Traumschule is looking into creating a wiki page or opening a ticket for this project.
3)	Every alternate solution we looked at didn’t have the advantages that this solution had, which is the ability to provide PSTN access and interconnections to public Internet XMPP servers.
4)	Results of a test were conducted and one second round trip latency was noticed from PSTN to a soft phone connected via Tor (via OpenVPN). Hopefully performance improvement will be noticed with OnionCat.

Understood about the half-duplex communication, but I’m trying to keep this as close to as standard PSTN usage as possible. My goal for this project is to allow an independent journalist in a hostile country or a censored user that happens to not have any technical knowledge other than to connect a soft phone to a username and a password via a a relay or a bridge and make that phone call to communicate to the world what is really going on.
Half Duplex communications are great, but Gulf War I proved to the world how valuable full duplex, real time audio communication can be in a given situation, especially in a situation where no one else is able to provide the world that insight.
For the switching portion of this project - once we’ve proven a concept we need to get a project page like has Iain has suggested. I hope that the switching project’s switches will be required to have open IAX2 interconnect policies and a master directory of “Area” Codes :P.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What is the weirdest/creepiest thing you have found 
Just adding a little on to this, when I was in the Navy stationed at a
Joint Command, there were certain situations which communications,
access to hidden services we ran, and access to the Internet required
the use of Tor. When I was attached to a particular Naval Security
Command, we conducted communications experiments with Tor under the
guidance of a sponsoring Laboratory and a Command that was interested
in the technology. I got into relays because of that, but the point is
I never realized that there was a dark side of Tor until someone I saw
it on the news one day.
I don't feel that Tor should really be tainted with the name "Dark
Web" because of all of the positive uses of the technology - from
dissidents, to governments, to journalists, to just end users that
want to protect their privacy. "Dark Web" has a bad connotation and
confuses uninformed users with the true intent of Tor. The actions of
a few (a few drug hidden services that are getting shut down, etc.)
shouldn't taint the actions of the many.

expanding Tor's FreeBSD Resiliency. There's quite a few people that
would like to help but aren't comfortable making the plunge on their
own. Increasing the number of FreeBSD machines ensures we don't have a
single point of failure as the number of Linux machines presently on
Tor greatly outweighs the number of FreeBSD machines on Tor.
This was previously discussed, but I'm sure you weren't paying
attention, but that's where the project started from and it was always
a nonprofit project to begin with.
In addition, we're now assisting with AS divestment as well, to try to
get people off of highly populated ASes so those don't form single
points of failure. Which is another goal of the Project, from what I
have been told. I understand you may not get that, so I'll explain it
as simply as possible - too many middle relays and exits are getting
service from the same service providers. We are trying to help provide
another Tor friendly service provider to the table (which runs
separately from this since that's a commercial operation).
When we had are stuff fully online, we occupied all 15 top spots of
the highest bandwidth exits in Canada. Right now my highest performing
exit in the US is in the Top 10 but I've been scaling that exit down
as I'm not sure if I'm keeping my personal items online anymore at
this point.
Finally, the GreyPony project has been there to make it be able for an
enduser be able to easily setup and get going on their first new relay
with dedicated support, sometimes people want that extra hand.
Before you trash a project before you should learn about it, but all
you've been doing is trashing things. Maybe you should try
contributing to something and ignoring things you disagree with or
asking questions if you don't understand it, instead of just resorting
to talking trash about a project. I just makes it look like you have
plenty of free time to mock others because you aren't helping others,
but that's my take on things.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Well, 
How was my response advertising or a repeat commercial offer? How is
my service even a commercial offer when it's a 501(c)(3) non-profit
and I'm not making a profit? How come you don't seem to get so
offended when Emerald Onions (for example, I have absolutely nothing
against them at all) supports an update about their services?
Why am I questioned for responding to an email bashing me for
attempting to contribute to the Tor project in a large way by helping
others run their own relays by asking that person how they're
contributing to Tor project themself? I would think that would fall
under the lines of "general discussion." I don't see where I'm
advertising for Greypony when all I'm doing is refuting this person's
demonstrably false statements such as "the project only runs middle
relays on small virtual machines" or "500 KB/s" bridges" which does
fall under the guidelines of general discussion and free speech. After
all, the only counteract to false speech is free speech.
I do wonder why the Tor Community Council wants to have such a
Chilling Effect on any speech related to GreyPony while allowing all
others to speak freely. It's kind of odd especially since it was
previously posted on this list that people could post even about
COMMERCIAL providers that are Tor friendly once and awhile but we're
OK a little hypocritical behavior if we don't like someone, amirite?

Yes, hiro was speaking as a community council member. The email was
verbatim to the email sent to me personally.

Whomever this bad actor is made their attempt so obvious it makes you wonder if this was the first part of an full scale attack, with this part drawing attention while they implement other measures to capture packets.

I'm sorry to top post, but it was the easiest way to get my message
across. If you're worried about information leakage, have you perhaps
looked into running Tails from a USB stick or on a VM?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Abuse email bot 
I just figured I would ask to see if anyone had one before I wrote one
or looked to see if there was a decent solution out there. Since
Irdeto and all of those lovely DMCA companies ignore WHOIS comments
that say "please open a web ticket here at  to report DMCA
related abuse" I was wondering if anyone had a solution that
automatically searches an abuse email for the reply-to email address,
since it's usually sent by a nobody@ account or an automated account
that bounces emails, will take whatever associated case number there
is with the DMCA complaint, and send a reply, explaining that it's a
Tor node, if you still want to file a case, open a trouble ticket here
at this link?
If someone has something already, I would appreciate it some tips.

@_subject: [tor-talk] VPNs and Ports 
I’ll be starting a free VPN service soon to allow users that are blocked from using Tor at their location to access Tor. To prevent abuse of the service, I plan on restricting the ability of the VPN to only access 53, 80, 443, 8080, 8443, 9001, and 9030. Are there any other ports I should consider keeping open for the service?

I’m already running a couple of exits and bridges, this was just something in addition to it since I’m bringing some new infrastructure online.

Sorry for top posting, but I can’t help but to ask, since you seem overtly cautious about your security, why don’t you utilize a solution such as booting Tails from a USB key (Higher degree of confidence of anonymity and prevention of leakage) or use Tails in a VirtualBox VM? (High degree of confidence of anonymity and prevention of leakage). I know it’s not directly Tor Browser, but it’s Tor Browser integrated into an isolated bootable Operating System for your security.
