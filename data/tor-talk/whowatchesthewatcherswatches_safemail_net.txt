@_subject: Noscript JAR Settings? (Still Unanswered! Reposting With The Hope of An Answer!) 
Noscript default settings under JAR tab marked as NOT blocked are both no script domains in the box within this section and the entry at the very bottom of the JAR section titled "pattern matching sample". With default settings, wouldn't this allow a rogue exit node to hijack or control Tor client's browser sessions by faking the noscript domain with a method?
What should these default settings in the JAR section be changed to? Should the entries in these sections be highlighted and removed before Tor use? What harm is there in Noscript performance should these two sections within the JAR area of Noscript configuration be cleared or left alone with default values?

@_subject: Noscript 2.0 causes error messages in Tor 
I experienced errors in Tor with failure messages related to a destination address. I determined the new version of Noscript was the cause and reading the article below, I now know why. If you have witnessed these errors with Noscript 2.0, reply here. Whst is the remedy to this error?
I downgraded to an older version to dodge this error, I would like to keep current. The new feature related to ABE, see below, was causing the error message in Tor. Tor works with Noscript 2.0, but with error messages timed to every 5-10 minutes. I don't recommend Noscript 2.0 for Tor users ATM unless this error may be resolved.
Noscript 2.0 Released, Firefox Plugin
28 July 2010, 17:38
NoScript ( creator Giorgio Maone ( has announced ( the release of version 2.0 of his open source extension for Mozilla's Firefox browser that blocks the execution of JavaScript, Java, Flash and other plug-ins or scripted content. The add-on for Firefox includes a white list ( to allow scripts from certain web sites and helps to prevent clickjacking ( attacks, which involve a crafted web site inserting a transparent iFrame underneath the user's cursor. Victims believe that they are clicking on the displayed web page, when in fact they are actually clicking on control elements (e.g. buttons) on a transparent iFrame from another website.
According to its developer, the latest version of the NoScript add-on for Firefox is even more reliable, has an updated user interface synchronisation system that's more efficient than previous versions and includes several improvements against cross-site scripting (XSS). Maone is especially proud of the new feature in version 2.0 that builds on the add-on's Application Boundaries Enforcer (ABE) ( module and provides cross-zone CSRF protection for flawed routers which expose their WAN IP on their LAN interface, saying that it "saves your router's ass even if it's so flawed to expose its UI on the LAN with its WAN IP". Other changes include the addition of an import / export feature, better handling of mixed permissions pages and improved support for Firefox Mobile, also known as "Fennec".
More details about the release can be found in the change log ( NoScript 2.0 is available to download ( from the project's site or from the Add-ons for Firefox ( portal and supports Firefox 3.0 or later. Users running older versions of Firefox must use the previous 1.10.x branch of NoScript. NoScript is licensed under version 2 of the GNU General Public License (
