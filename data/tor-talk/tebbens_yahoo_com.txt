@_subject: The use of malicious botnets to disrupt The Onion Router 
The problem of corrupted exit servers is indeed one that we should all
ponder until a solution may be found.  However, setting up, say, 1,000 hidden,
slaved, correctly configured tor servers via a bot net may be rather more
difficult to accomplish than you have fully considered.  Entry guards and
middlemen probably wouldn't be useful to an attack coordinator.
