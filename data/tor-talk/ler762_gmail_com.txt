@_subject: Windows buffer problems 
This bit from the web page:
  "Manipulating
and TcpWindowSize to 0xfaf00 (1027840) seemed to increase the time to
failure when running Tor and BitTorrent."
seems backwards.  Instead of buffering up to 16KB of data for each
open connection you're telling the system to buffer up to 1MB of data
for each open connection.  How can increasing system buffer usage help
if the problem is insufficient buffer space?
So I'm wondering if the problem could be that the system runs out of
available ports.
XP defaults to using something like 4K ports and 240 seconds for
keeping a closed socket in the timed wait state.  Has anyone tried
bumping the allowable port numbers up to 64K and dropped the timed
wait state time to 16 seconds?

@_subject: My tor exit node is STILL gone from the node list 
Hi Alexandru,
Routing could very well be just fine & PMUTD still be broken..  but it
looks like the problem is with Ecatel network announcements.  Check
this out: give it your network (89.248.169.0/24), select the last few days and
watch how the route bounces around.
I'd suggest getting a list of the directory servers and creating a
script that tries to connect to each one every 20-30 minutes.  Log the
status of each connection attempt and, assuming there's some failures,
go back to your provider with the list of IP addresses and times when
you couldn't connect to them.  Give them specific times & IP addresses
and they might be able to fix whatever it is.
I have no idea, but it couldn't hurt to enable logging and see if
there's anything interesting logged.
It'd be nice if somebody could give you the status/timestamp of your
server as seen from the directory servers.  That might be enough to
help your provider figure out what the problem is.

Which is why I stopped running a relay - waaaay too many people poking
at my machine.  In retrospect I was probably just incredibly naive,
but when I put up a tor relay I was expecting to just relay tor
traffic.  I did not sign up to be the target of any wannabe pen
The difference being that enterprise security monitoring systems are
monitoring *enterprise* systems.  Tor exits and relays do not belong
to you; you have no right (certainly the ability, but NOT the right)
to run pen tests on those machines.
Absolutely brilliant.  Someone donates to your cause and, if they
don't come up to your standards, you do your best to ensure they get
pwned instead of just dropping them from the donor list.
It seems to me the only legitimate "do something" available to the Tor
community would be to drop the server from the list of tor nodes.
It wouldn't be hard to set up, but absent an agreement with the owners
to allow scanning, how long do you thing it would last?  I kept adding
IPs to my blacklist until I got tired of it & turned the relay off.

You haven't cleared it with me.

Super.  So in addition to deciding how I *should* feel, now _you_ get

suspect the tor network would lose a lot of servers if they're
required to allow your "free security audit, without any illegal

You probably wouldn't like the suggestion I have for you...
No it isn't.
We seem to have a fundamental disagreement.  If I provide a service to
anyone on the Internet, that does not imply I've given permission for
anyone to to do anything to that server.
Agreed, there isn't much that I can do to stop anyone from attempting
anything - which is why I took my relay down.  People like you decide
that public resources are their own personal play-toys and do whatever
they feel like with, or to, them.
What part of the concept "your behavior is indistinguishable from a
Tor unfriendly person" are you having trouble grasping?
The problem is that I don't know you, I don't know your intentions,
and I haven't given you permission to do a security audit, free or
otherwise, on my machine.  You need to GET PERMISSION FIRST or you're
behaving exactly like those "Tor unfriendly person" you mentioned.

would one see for something like   Are they
using the same cert for all their servers world-wide? (the context of
this discussion -is- if one is using tor :)
How does one do that using tor?
Of course not!!  When I'm using tor the latency is all over the place,
I don't even know how to look at the hop count and, with my current
limited knowledge, my "server particulars" checking is if I've got a
lock icon or no
Which brings us full circle ..  how do you verify that the ssl
connection is to the site you want & not something else?
Indeed.  I agree, but consider this a thought experiment - how does
one use tor with a high degree of confidence that your https traffic
is not being MITMed?
For example, China is the great boogey-man wrt monitoring/modifying
user traffic.  I can add an "ExcludeNodes {cn}" to my torrc and delete
all the chinese-looking CAs from my browser.  Now all I've got to
worry about is every other gov't and all of the malicious exit node
operators (including the chinese gov't exit nodes set up outside

[.. snip stuff addressed to others ..]
My understanding is that the issue is common to all 'secured' web
sites.   HTTP is trivially subverted; HTTPS needs a valid cert or the
user clicking past a "No, I don't care about my security; go there
anyway" warning before it can be subverted.
My solution is to not download software over tor and verify the
downloaded software.  Sometimes it isn't possible to verify the
software & sometimes I don't bother verifying.. depends on how I feel
at the moment.
For it to be a major concern, an attacker would have to a) have a
valid certificate b) man-in-the-middle your traffic.
What are the chances of someone other than the site owner getting a
valid cert for the site?  In Google's case, apparently 100%
What are the chances of someone MITMing your traffic?  If you use TOR,
100%  So how highly do you rate the probability of a tor exit node
maliciously altering your traffic?
Going back to the 1st msg in the thread:
It depends on what you think the chances of someone doing a MITM attack.
Microsoft & FF seem to have already done that.  Use the defaults and
neither asks if you want to upgrade/install patches.  (I could be
wrong there - I do my best to disable automatic updates on everything)
I think microsoft already has - looks like all their software is
digitally signed.
That's a decision you have to make for yourself.
Enough that I don't download software when using TOR.  Sometimes I
verify signatures, sometimes I don't bother.  I am very picky about
where I download software from tho.  But realize that isn't a
guarantee.. sourceforge got hacked not that long ago & that's one of
the sites I do get software from.
Any "secure" ( site certainly is; dunno if that's all though.
It would be nice if someone who actually knew all this stuff would
give a long answer.  I've been reading blogs, same as you, and come to
my own conclusions and made my own decisions regarding 'safe
behavior'.  Do I think I'm "safe"? No.  But in full-out paranoid mode
I can't think of anything that would make me safe, so I go with what I
consider reasonable precautions.

@_subject: [tor-talk] time to disable 3DES? 
Sure seems to be a function of firefox.   Enter about:config in the
url bar, enter security.ssl in the search bar, double-click lines
containing 'des' to change the pref to false, revisit
The point was showing the ciphers supported by the browser.  For this
case, I don't care what ciphers the server supports.
Which means?
I know approximately zip about crypto, but AES was selected as the
replacement for DES back in 2000 & it seems like DES has always lived
under the cloud of "did NSA deliberately weaken it?"   So why keep it
around?  It's not like there are no alternatives..

Right.  But is it still safe to use?
but if it's turned off/disabled then I'm sure it won't be used
Who checks to see if the web server on the remote end is horrifically
Not me..
My question is if there's a good reason to keep 3DES, not is there
some better way of attacking TBB users.
So...  if you're visiting a web site that does only 3DES encryption,
is that good enuf or do you say no thanks & go elsewhere?

Maybe CERT isn't technically a federal agency, but it seems pretty darn close.
The CERT Division works closely with the Department of Homeland

Report Malware and vulnerabilities to DHS by e-mail at cert at cert.org

At one point, the tor docs said it wasn't proof against a global

Something else to consider
  "... Evidence in United States v. Jay Michaud hinged at least in part on
    information federal investigators had gathered by exploiting a vulnerability

to how much time elapses between a FF 'remote code execution' vuln

  - with no caveats.
  BLOCK TRACKERS
  - except they aren't actually blocked, just isolated.  right?
  DEFEND AGAINST SURVEILLANCE
  - I suspect tor is a better defense than using a vpn but still...
with no warnings or caveats it seems a bit much.
  RESIST FINGERPRINTING
  - yay!  "Tor Browser aims to ..."  a reasonable claim.
But wait!  There's more!!
Click on the 'Download Tor Browser' link & go to
Click on the 'Download Tor Browser' link on that page and get sent to
"../download/" but that's where I was, so wtf?  Maybe I need
javascript enabled??
There's also a link for "Verify Tor Browser signature" but no link to
the signature file.
At least the "Download in another language" link gets me to a page
where I can download tbb and the sig.  It doesn't show which version
will be downloaded, but it does have working links, so it's infinitely
better than the download page.

If they'd fix the download link on
 it would be a lot better.
It seems to me that newcomers are the ones that most need warnings
instead of a blanket
   Protect yourself against tracking, surveillance, and censorship.
but I don't see anything there about tbb not defaulting to a safer config
  and is this still be an open problem?
  But tor needs 'covering traffic' and .. what?  They don't want to
scare people away?
  I'm missing a link for downloading tor.

If I thought they'd add some warnings, sure, but I suspect that adding
anything that would make the tor browser look less than perfectly safe
isn't going to happen.
For the download page:
line 132 - remove this bit
            Download Tor Browser
You're already on Having a link to the page you're already on is confusing at best.
line 333 - remove this bit, over-promising & linking to the page
you're already on
Download Tor Browser
Download Tor Browser to experience
real private browsing without tracking, surveillance, or
              Download Tor Browser
I don't remember where this quote came from, but it was from a
discussion on web page design:
  Iconography is counter intuitive to the literate.
Underneath the graphics that I thought were just graphics - eg:
add the link text for the program & signature
      torbrowser-install-win64-8.0.8_en-US.exe
And move the
  Verify Tor Browser signature
link to immediately after.
