@_subject: [tor-talk] How do I separate/isolate Tor streams in TorBirdy 
Yes ist is.
Just use the addon proxyfoxy. With this addon you can choose different
proxys for different domain wildcards. So you can choose for each mail
account another tor-instance.
I don't know if this is really needed because torbirdy uses the
SOCKSPort which can isolate streams, but I don't know which isolation
flag is set by default.
