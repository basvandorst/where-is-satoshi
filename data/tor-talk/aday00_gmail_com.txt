Side-by-side would be good.
I'm often switching my proxy settings around between port 8118 (use Privoxy+Tor) and port 8119 (use Privoxy w/o Tor). I don't like the Firefox "Tor button" plugin because it's too global. I'd like one session that I know will use Tor, and another that won't. I was considering installing Seamonkey with different proxy settings for this reason alone. It's good to be able to use the full speed of my connection, while still keeping the anonymous option open for some traffic.
I think themes may be a bit distracting too, but that depends on the theme. Having a different process name would be nice, or a little icon somewhere would be enough. Just so long as I can tell the two apart and have them be separate processes with separate configurations.
