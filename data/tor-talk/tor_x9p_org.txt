@_subject: [tor-talk] [tor-relays] Action relays on 188.214.30.0/24 subnet 
The set of "potentially" (no proof!) unwanted relays was updated (looks
automagically via script or sort of), still do not have their HSDir flag
back, only 17h uptime.
Meanwhile, HS users, HS operators, if you feel these nodes are suspicious
enough (if not, please discard this message), you can add in your torrc:
StrictNodes 1
ExcludeNodes B3466ED26C27D57205A1FAEB3FCA888EA5DCA1C5,
And optionally block them in your firewall:
If these relay's operator decides to give a speech, am all ears.

nice move from EFF, thanks Seth. If accepted and implemented by Lets Encrypt, super :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Google Goes Full Retard Against Tor 
do all sorts of egregious nasty things with google on
its a capitalist world, it has good and bad aspects. your gmail.com
mailbox is a good aspect of google.
its possible to try to boycott it, what about vimeo policy on Tor? Or
setting up a crowdfunding project to make all YT videos available via Tor HS, replicating all youtube content to Tor users, captcha-free?, saying a
big fuck you to all licenses.
Fuck google for the annoying captchas, information collecting, NSA
partnership (forced by subpoenas or money-driven). God bless google for
Project zero and gmail inboxes, and Google drive. Internet dichotomy.

Assuming "grarpamp" does not use a PGP key for sensitive matters, than
yes, you are right.
Assuming not, I stick to my point.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Need a stable .onion address hosted by the Tor 
I believe you should not trust just 1 .onion address, there are latency problems, AS problems, circuit congestion, I believe much more.
You should compile a list of different public .onion addresses hosted in different AS/countries and try them in a round robin way.

My point is, even google, AWS or facebook have some routing/datacenter issues, from time to time (the most recent some days ago with google DNS routing). So, choose 3 different HS hosted in different AS/datacenters and test them in round-robin.
But as nusenu already pointed out, maybe a better idea is to just test the exit node.
Interesting stuff, "KERNEL MAGIC" instead of LD_PRELOAD. Wish you success. Please keep us posted.

A hackish, lame, gnupg backed, volatile way of making hidden service de-anonymisation harder
I think today the main problems with Hidden Services are:
-Actors setting up high bandwith relays/guards HS directories and collecting descriptors
-HS vanity name needs to be popular, so users can identify it and come back
-Positioning attack via bruteforce
I believe almost all problems are expected to be addressed with next-gen HS
While waiting for that, we can take some simple steps and take the game to the next level of
cat-and-mouse, which will cause some trouble to snoopers and wanna-be snoopers:
I believe:
-GnuPG is your friend
-Offshore VPS are quite cheap nowadays
-Try to avoid most-know cloud providers for "market entry" servers - Azure, Google, AWS, OVH
-Security-focused Linux and BSD are nice
-Dont be too much paranoid :P
-Choose a control server
-Setup 3 "market entry" servers as test on AWS
-Cron job on "market entry" servers rebooting machine every X hours - I know its good to
avoid AWS, but the always changing IP address from AWS instances here are being used in your
Control server (no need to stay online all the time):
1)Access marketplace backend server via SSH, using keys for auth, preferably SSH via HS
 -Generate new HS onion URL every X hours
 -Sign it with GnuPG key
2)Choose one "market entry" server
 -Setup vanity HS private key in a "market entry" server and reload tor
 -Remove vanity HS private from old "market entry" server and reload tor
 -Setup an 302 redirect under nginx/apache/lighthttpd with new HS onion URL generated at 1)
into "market entry" server, put 30 seconds delay, message signed with private key so users
can check wheter redirect is legit or not
 -Expect "market entry" servers to be found, so make them short-lived and rotate between
different providers
