@_subject: [tor-talk] Help with Tor and Flash Player plugin struggle 
Hello tor-talk members,
I've now tried everything and I cannot get ANY Flash content to play in this Tor-Firefox ESR web browser, even though I've tried installing the Flash player plugin that this browser asks for when I'm on a YouTube page (and even though this computer already had a current Flash Player plugin installed previously).
Let me make it clear that privacy is not important to me _/*right now*/_ during this quest to make the Flash Player plugin work with this Tor browser... I can reset any settings for maximum privacy later when I go back to that purpose for using Tor... right now, I'm just trying to make the Tor browser play Flash content.
So even though I've /*UNCHECKED*/ the /*Torbutton>Preferences>Security Settings>Disable plugin during Tor usage*/ box, and I installed a new Flash player plugin /*THROUGH*/ this browser, and I even set it to allow all scripts because I thought maybe that was complicating things, /*IT STILL WILL NOT PLAY FLASH CONTENT OF ANY TYPE*/.
to ask for your help with...*/
If I go to the Tor Browser folder on my hard drive at /*C:>Tor Browser>FirefoxPortable>Data>plugins*/ there are NO Flash plugin files that show up in that folder even after I install a new Flash Player plugin THROUGH this browser... I believe that is why it will not play Flash content.
All it does when I install a Flash Player plugin through this Tor browser is to overwrite my Windows 7 system Flash Player plugin, but it does not actually place any Flash Player plugin files in the /*C:>Tor Browser>FirefoxPortable>Data>plugins*/ folder, so that's why this PORTABLE version of the Firefox ESR browser will not play any Flash content... and it doesn't work from the Windows system Flash Player plugin the way that my normal Firefox (NON-TOR) web browser does.  My other Firefox web browser sees the the Windows system Flash Player plugin just fine and it does play Flash content correctly.
There is, however, one text file that comes stock inside the Tor browser plugins folder and when it is opened it says, /*"Place Firefox plugins in this directory (Flash, Shockwave, etc)"*/.
So with some advice from someone on the Adobe help forum, I tried copying the Flash Player plugin files from the Windows system folder at folder at /*C:>Tor Browser>FirefoxPortable>Data>plugins*/, and that still didn't work.
Note that I am closing and re-opening the Tor browser between each of these tests.
So I then followed some further advice from the expert on the Adobe help forum and I changed the name of the main Flash Player plugin file that I had copied and pasted in to the Tor browser plugins folder from not work... note that I left all the other files that I copied and pasted from the Windows system Flash plugins folder with the same name they originally had... I tried only changing that one Flash plugin file name, as instructed by the expert on the Adobe help forum.
I also tried posting a question about this on the Mozilla Firefox forum, but no one there is able to answer this question.
What the problem seems to be is that when this Tor-Firefox ESR 10.0.7 browser installs a Flash Player plugin, it just installs it to the Windows system folder /*(the same way that the normal (non-Tor) Firefox browser does)*/ and _/*NOT*/_  into the Tor-Firefox plugins folder it to be able to play Flash content.
No matter what I do, whenever I try to view a YouTube video or any Flash video in this browser, or any Flash graphic content at all, I get the yellow bar at the top of the page that says /*"Additional plugins are required to display all the media on this page - Install Missing Plugins"*/ and there is a banner displayed where the Flash content is supposed to be that says, /*"The Adobe Flash Player is required for video playback - Get the latest Flash Player"*/.
And as I explained at the top of this email, I have already installed and re-installed the Flash Player plugin on this computer multiple times, including doing it directly through this Tor-Firefox ESR browser files in to the Tor-Firefox browser plugins folder at C:>Tor Browser>FirefoxPortable>Data>plugins, and where do I get those files?  Everything I've tried, which is pretty extensive, has not worked, and it seems that someone there should know about this.*/
Thanks for your help,
