Why is it suggested not to do this? Does it matter as long as I'm not at
all concerned about privacy? I want to run a wallet-less bitcoin node and
thought I might as well make it accessible via Tor, however it definitely
isn't worth paying for an extra server to serve as a dedicated proxy.
BTW, what kind of memory usage can I get by with to run a Tor server? How
about a Tor node?

Oops. Server = hidden service and node = relay. It made sense in my mind,
but precision is important. I'm already kinda tight on my bitcoin node
(190/256MB). Averaging 1MByte/s and 20 simultaneous connections, would it
be worth trying to squeeze a Tor hidden service in there? What are the
determinants of the memory use? Is it more # of connections or rate of

Hi, I'm running a node on 107.161.31.82. (Sorry if IP isn't enough. I don't
really know what's best wrt identification of a node.) It's been up since
Oct. 13, but I'm still not seeing any traffic. Is there something I need to

I calculated 200KB/s to be about half my monthly allowance, so I have
150KB/s in my torrc. (Or at least I thought I did.)
RelayBandwidthRate 150 KBytes  # Throttle traffic to 150KB/s (1200Kbps)
RelayBandwidthBurst 800 KBytes # But allow bursts up to 800KB (6400Kb)

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to write program that uses Tor network 
This is a lot of really good advice. Thanks. For some reason, I was
thinking C++ would give a measurable performance increase for the spider,
but after having questioned that it seems really dumb. Obviously the
network will be the bottleneck by far. I think I'll still use C++ for the
back end though, since that's where the performance might matter. I'm also
thinking about using Wt for the frontend. It seems like most of the search
engines on Tor aren't capable of holding up to the load. Do you think
that's caused by computational limits or upload/download rate limits?

Hi, I'm writing a spider in C++ and thinking about running it on the Tor
hidden network. I'm using boost::asio for the network API. What would be
the best/easiest way for me to retrieve pages from the Tor hidden network?
P.S. Yes, I'm respecting robots.txt and rate limiting. I'm not going to DOS
you guys.

Also, about rate limiting, what sort of rate limit do y'all think would be
mindful of the health of the network and the average site? I'm thinking a
maximum of 1 req per second per site and 10 reqs per second overall (in
other words, 10 sites per second). But based on my experience browsing with
TBB, that might be too much.
