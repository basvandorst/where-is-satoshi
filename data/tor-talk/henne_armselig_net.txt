Hey guys,
have been lurking here for a while, but now I need some advice on how
to handle this special situation:
I've been running an exit node from my home network for ca. a year or
so. Now I've receviced mail from 21st Century Fox's lawyers in Germany
accusing me of torrenting a movie. Since all I offer via Torrent are
some old PC-BSD-ISOs and "House on Haunted Hill", I'm pretty sure it
must have been a user from the TOR network.
Now they want me to pay ?1.0000 (which I don't have due to recent
health problems and unemployment) and sign some papers. I'm not going
to do that. Even if it turns out to be more expensive, I'm looking for
legal advice now. So if you do happen to know a lawyer in Germany, who
knows about Torrents, TOR etc., please let me know!
Also, I'd love to hear about similar experiences and how you dealt
with the issue.

Hi Moritz,
thank you very much for your quick reply. The draft letter you
provided is very helpful and I didn't know about
metrics.torproject.org to "prove" that I was running an exit node on
that IP address.
I'll keep looking for a lawyer, though. Just in case. If you guys are
interested, I'll post any updates here or blog about it.

Small update:
I've snail-mailed them a letter based on what Moritz had posted. They
replied with a standardized letter without even commenting on my
statements. It's basically saying "Last chance to pay or we'll go to
So I'm a little unsure whether or not it's now time to actually
consult a lawyer or wait until FOX makes it's next move.

Hey Joe,
thanks for sharing!
They're demanding ?450 compensation for the alleged sharing of the
movie via BitTorrent. Plus ?506 lawyer's fees. So in total we're
talking about ?956,-
FOX is working with a German company, ipoque GmbH, that monitors
filesharing platforms. So they've logged my IP (the exit node), the
time stamp, the hash of the file in question and got a court order
that forced my ISP to handover my personal data to them.

Hey guys,
it's been a while since my last mail, but I had decided to keep it low
and not post anything public on the subject. Several months have
passed since the last mail from FOX's lawyers and I've heard nothing
from them since then.
Therefore I've come to the conclusion that they dropped the case
because of the statement I sent that Moritz had prepared. Special
thanks for that! My exit relay is back up and pumping the GBs.
Thank you very much for your support and input!
Mit freundlichen Gr??en /
With kind regards,
  Hendrik Neumann
