@_subject: [tor-talk] FW: ID digest is 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 
I have upgraded Tor to TBB 3.5 and run Vidalia to continue to provide an internal relay. I have been running a small relay daily for a solid six months.
Now, doing some logging to see if all is well with the new versions, I found my log file has entries with a really interesting ID digest.
Dec 29 13:36:34.000 [info] channel_tls_process_netinfo_cell(): Got good NETINFO cell from [scrubbed]:1061; OR connection is now open, using protocol version 3. Its ID digest is 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000.
Is someone just playing with a modified build of TOR? Is something else, preferably really sinister...(just kidding)...happening? If you feel like satisfying my curiosity, please let me know.
Have a safe and happy New Year,
  Hans
