Oh, but we do. It's called "market discipline", and it goes like this:
"Hi Verizon. Cancel my account. I've switched to a real ISP that
connects me to the *entire* Internet."
No, we can't. Those systems are useless for stopping spam (but great for
breaking forwarding). Even if domain authentication were a good idea,
you'd want cryptographic authentication like Domain Keys. But even that
is not real authentication. If you want real email authentication, you
should use PGP signatures.
The spam problem is a text classification problem. Any proposed solution that works by side effect ("DHCP users are bad and can't send email", "China is bad and can't send email", "This MX is bad and can't send email") is no solution at all.
We're getting pretty far afield from Tor now...
The estimated-users:complaints ratio is actually very good.
No, we don't. If your application needs authentication, your application needs REAL authentication. Discriminating against people on the basis of their IP route is ridiculous and counter-productive, and always was.
EFF is promoting free speech, safety, and security.
EFF never has supported abuse, and never will.

Ugg, yes. This reminds me that John Gilmore has been talking about a

work cross-platform would be "fun" (write a firewall config for all
major platforms that somehow does not interfere with any other

@_subject: Ideal Tor Server & ExitNode? 
I'm not sure what you mean. The Tor server is not in any sense It is true that the more traffic and the more types of traffic there are
on the network, the better protected all Tor users are. Whether that has
any meaning vis-a-vis a single particular node, I don't know.
I don't think directly, but CPU utilization on a Tor server is largely a
function of the amount of bandwidth the server passes. There are
indications that traffic analysis may be easier (the timing of packets
is more predictable) when a server's CPU is heavily loaded.
So get more CPU power than you think you need. :)
At the very least, open exit policies on high-capacity machines make the network more usable, and usability enables us to have more users, which results in more and more varied traffic, which increases anonymity.
I don't think we're at the point yet where we want to set limits. There is the potential that a high-capacity node might get more traffic, and thus if that node is compromised (from the point of view of a particular user), then it's a greater risk than it would otherwise be. But we're still in experimental mode, and capacity and debugging opportunities are The default exit policy is good.
You should encrypt or disable swap for all sorts of reasons, besides just Tor. So, yes.
Logs are used for tracking bugs and ensuring correct operation. I think you can set a relatively short window for your logs, like maybe a week or less. Also, log at the default level, increasing verbosity only if you are actually investigating a problem. Decreasing log verbosity might be a good idea, but since Tor is still experimental, it might help most at this time to stick to the default verbosity level.
No idea.
Host integrity is critical, and you can best ensure that by using a safe
OS (let me know if you find one...) with minimal services enabled. Ideally, you'd run nothing but Tor, but realistically you'll probably
also want SSH for administration. But be sure to configure SSH in as
paranoid a manner as is possible for you (allow connections from certain
IPs, allow only certain users, disallow remote root logins, don't use
sudo or use a VERY careful sudo configuration, and so on).
Tor itself should not generate or keep any sensitive information in
non-volatile storage. Not having any non-volatile storage at all is
obviously great if you can do it (e.g. boot from a CDROM that launches
Tor, have no hard drive).
It would be great to have a machine with no writable non-volatile
storage, which runs only Tor and not SSH. Rebooting in case of trouble
would be acheived by one of those remotely-controllable power strips
and/or by physical access. There is the question of logging. Maybe a loghost, which the Tor server connects to by tunnelling syslog over UDP over TCP over TLS...

all they had to do was block the IP running Tor (or even just block the

I just called them up and told them what was going on, and I was back

You don't have much, if any, leverage against your ISP. The worst you
can do is take your monthly payment away from them, and they've got many
more customers who are unaware of or don't care about the issues you do.
Oh yes, using an exit node you feel is more trustworthy is an excellent
idea. That's why the ExitNodes configuration directive exists, and the
..exit feature.
Same as SSL, or any other encryption. Your data is encrypted multiple
times while it's inside the Tor network; only the exit node sees the
final plaintext after it peels off the last layer of the encryption.
If an adversary alters the ciphertext of an encrypted cell of Tor
traffic, the cell will fail the integrity check done by each Tor node in
your circuit, and the cell will have to be resent.
When using Tor, threats against data integrity come from the exit node,
from the destination server, and from your own client software. That's a
major win compared to the situation when not using Tor: your data is
under integrity threat from *every* intermediary, instead of just the
last! This, combined with the ability to choose your exit node, puts you
way ahead of the game.

We know another person who wanted to analyze Tor traffic coming out of
exit nodes for academic research, and I'm not sure where he ended up,
legally speaking. There were thorny issues, although I think he planned
to scrub and aggregate the traffic. I don't know if he ever went through
with it, although I think we would have heard from him if so since he's
a friend.
Lawyers tend to advise their clients to take the least risky and safest
path. In this traffic sniffing example, it's obviously safest not to go
anywhere near violating the Wiretap Act. The surveillance laws and
related case law are not as clear-cut as we might hope them to be, and
surprising results sometimes come out of the courts on these topics. (I
helped with the drafting of a brief by EPIC in the Brad Councilman case,
for example. That was a weird one, although note that it had to do with
stored communications, not communications in transit; and that the law
distinguishes between the two.)
I am not a lawyer, but as the Tor legal FAQ says, you can contact our
privacy/surveillance/speech lawyer Kevin Bankston if you want to get
legal information, or if you want to get help finding representation.
(Please, everyone, don't spam Kevin with frivolous questions.)
Nobody, least of all me, ever suggested that security through nobility
is a good idea.
Certainly. It's also possible to do so without going anywhere near the
Wiretap or other Acts, such as by auditing the code, black-box testing
techniques like fuzzing, running a Tor network on private hardware that
3rd parties are not using in production and tcpdumping that, and so on.
If you want to do a white hat pen test kind of thing on the public Tor

I understand the need, and I'll fly it past our lawyers to see what they
think about drafting such a policy paper. They are unlikely to make
strong, specific, forward-looking legal statements, of course.
I can tell you what I do, which I regard as reasonably safe and polite.
I run three Tor servers: one at EFF (confidence), one on a machine some
friends and I share (explosivenoodle), and one on my home DSL line
(livingcolour). confidence and explosivenoodle I run in middleman mode,
to minimize annoyance and potential liability for my employer and
friends (respectively). (EFF is considering running an exit server, but
we aren't yet.) livingcolour uses the default exit policy. All three
servers are rate-limited to about 20Kb/s because bandwidth is either
donated and I want to be nice (explosivenoodle), or limited (confidence
and livingcolour). I don't sniff traffic on any of these three hosts,
and I log at warn level, using debug level only for limited times when I
actually am trying to debug something (rarely). All three machines are
kept up-to-date and run only services I actually use.
I don't commit abuse through Tor when I use it. That's easy -- "Oops, I
didn't troll on IRC again!"
I sometimes drive around in the Tor source tree for fun and learning,
but I haven't found any security bugs. If I did, I would simply tell
Roger and Nick. I have reported a few security-irrelevant bugs (and, I
sheepishly admit, non-bugs) to R and N and they have fixed them fast.

directives, for example, which caused Tor not to start. Nick fixed it in

BitTorrent is able to acheive this in part because peers can
automatically discover each other. Doing this in Tor, while still
providing protection against adversary peers, is more difficult.
Decentralizing the discovery process, for tit-for-tat and other reasons,

This is a false dichotomy. Computers and networks exist so their users
can do work. System and network administrators exist so users can
concentrate on their work and not be distracted by the foibles of the
equipment. Thus, the interests of administrators are in fact aligned
with those of users.
To demonstrate this principle, set your firewall to block port 80.

There's no way to handle this anywhere but where your TCP/IP stack
resides, i.e. the kernel. There is inherently no way to do this in a
cross-platform manner, and Tor is cross-platform and runs in userland.
Furthermore, there is no way we could set some default policy that would
work for everyone. Plenty of people dedicate entire machines to Tor;
others use Tor on machines running many applications.

 It's ironic that the Web once seemed to promise individuals new
 opportunities to explore the world without showing their face. Instead, it
 is turning out to be a powerful force against anonymity. Most information
 about people's online actions is traceable - if someone with resources
 cares to go to the trouble. But there will be much more to this trend than
 the familiar fear of governments spying on innocent victims, or even
 they-asked-for-it dissidents. The bigger questions revolve around the
 tolerance of societies for diversity and recognition of the human capacity
 for change.

@_subject: Slashdot banning Tor? 
DoS attacks are only effective if the attacker can impose higher
resource costs on the victim than the attacker must pay to mount the
For example, an attacker can open many TCP connections to a server but
never complete them; the server must keep the half-open connection open
for a specified length of time, while the attacker can simply never
respond. On a server open to the world, this can seriously degrade or
destroy performance. Similarly, an attacker can cause some operating
systems to behave badly by setting incoherent sets of options on a TCP
circuit. Since Tor normalizes TCP packets, some types of attacks are not
possible via Tor.
The Slashdot and Wikipedia problem is entirely at the content layer, not
at the network or transport layers. Tor itself is not concerned with the
content layer.

Have you ever installed Linux before? All you need to do is get Linux on

Installing Fedora is about as easy as installing an OS could be:
download the CD images and burn them to discs (or buy CDs), pop the
first CD in the drive of the machine, and reboot. Then just follow the

Which, for reference, is:
I think everyone understands your (not invalid) point. It's just that we accept all kinds of risks every day, and we deal with them. By using computers (and cars, and buildings, and ...) we open ourselves up to risks, but we continue to use them because the benefit they provide is greater than the risks. And the risks can be mitigated.
It's the same for Tor. Tor is more beneficial than it is risky, plain and simple.
To demonstrate the point, consider that the framers of the US Constitution provided for (and themselves made heavy use of) anonymous speech, even as they explicitly acknowledged the inherent risks. The US Supreme Court (and lower courts) continually reaffirm the right to free speech, even in the face of risks.

@_subject: IDS bells ringing 
Incorporating an IDS into Tor (or just running one alongside Tor) has been proposed before. Nothing can stop Tor server operators from running an IDS on the Tor traffic.
But doing so has its problems, such as when the Tor exit policy is not the same as that of the IDS (or firewall) the Tor server is subject to. In that case, a server may be falsely advertising its capabilities, to the detriment of the Tor network.
There is also this comment in the technical FAQ wiki:
"Adding an Intrusion Detection System to handle exit policies would increase the security complexity of Tor, and would likely not work anyway, as evidenced by the entire field of IDS and counter-IDS papers. Many potential abuse issues are resolved by the fact that Tor only transports valid TCP streams (as opposed to arbitrary IP including malformed packets and IP floods), so exit policies become even _more_ important as we become able to transport IP packets. We also need to compactly describe exit policies in the Tor directory, so clients can predict which nodes will allow their packets to exit -- and clients need to predict all the packets they will want to send in a session before picking their exit node!"
I have not read all the literature, but from what I've seen the entire IDS field is close to being discredited. (I could be wrong.) Like spam filtering, automated source code auditing and virus scanning, it's an AI-hard problem. Now, that doesn't mean you can't get good results, but it does mean you need to be a statistics genius with lots of free time, patience, and a very closely specified task domain.
The cost of failure when applying such tools to transport and network layer data is very high.
I think we already are pretty close to doing as much as is reasonable. Yes, it's *possible* to apply network, transport, content and other layer filters, but it's not at all clear they're worth the cost, complexity, and entertaining new failure modes.
Tor's exit policies in the hands of a responsible operator, together with reasonable and polite negotiation, have been enough so far. At least they have been in my experience.
And/or legislated, as the argument goes. This is also a highly problematic proposition. Perhaps you could have some sort of vendor liability law providing a cause of action for when software fails, but with some kind of carve-out for FOSS software. That's a whole can of worms I don't want to get into, but if you want to know some of the potential problems, read up on anti-spyware legislation and proposals for legislation.

I think I sense a problem already. It's Privoxy, an HTTP proxy, that listens on 8118. Tor listens on port 9050 for SOCKS connections.
The Privoxy configuration that is installed by the Mac installer is set to use Tor as a SOCKS proxy; thus, you have two ways of using Tor with your web browser:
1. Tell your web browser to use Privoxy as an HTTP (and HTTPS) proxy; Privoxy will then in turn use Tor.
2. Tell your browser to use Tor as a SOCKS proxy.

"""Abstract: Tor is a popular low-latency anonymity network. However, Tor does not protect against the exploitation of an insecure application to reveal the IP address of, or trace, a TCP stream. In addition, because of the linkability of Tor streams sent together over a single circuit, tracing one stream sent over a circuit traces them all. Surprisingly, it is unknown whether this linkability allows in practice to trace a significant number of streams originating from secure (i.e., proxied) applications. In this paper, we show that linkability allows us to trace 193% of additional streams, including 27% of HTTP streams possibly originating from ``secure'' browsers. In particular, we traced 9% of Tor streams carried by our instrumented exit nodes. Using BitTorrent as the insecure application, we design two attacks tracing BitTorrent users on Tor. We run these attacks in the wild for 23 days and reveal 10,000 IP addresses of Tor users. Using these IP addresses, we then profile not only the BitTorrent downloads but also the websites visited per country of origin of Tor users. We show that BitTorrent users on Tor are over-represented in some countries as compared to BitTorrent users outside of Tor. By analyzing the type of content downloaded, we then explain the observed behaviors by the higher concentration of pornographic content downloaded at the scale of a country. Finally, we present results suggesting the existence of an underground BitTorrent ecosystem on Tor."""

It's a question for our legal team. I'll ask them.
The main thing is that this feature is not intended for true real-time
MITM alerts. It's for research and study, and I hesitate to overload it
for MITM detection for all sorts of technical reasons, including those
Mike has raised.
