There may be numerous ways to do it (and we will hear from some after this I'll bet) but I was thinking of you hiring a bit of a server in the destination country (USA) and 'tunnelling' there from wherever you find yourself.
If you look for 'VPN + Hulu' you should get the idea.

I was looking for a long lasting shirt because it represents the value I place on Tor and the large amount of time and money expended on the up to 40 relays and exits I have had at times.
If people wear their Tor prize shirt for years they may well keep their relays or exits running too.

There ought to be a detailed guide for Tor being set-up on hired servers well intending people answering the call for more Tor nodes and specifically exits.

Thank you on behalf of the ideal.
I think you are an asset being a helper and a maintainer will more likely appear now.
It appears to me that there are far too many TOR people popping up on the same aspect leaving fragmented impressions.
If one person is the one to ask for directions it must be better than that.
One big question to do with using Amazon is "What can we do when the free year runs out that isn't costly?".
When I set up multiple accounts using all the credit cards I could manipulate they didn't notice that I was paying with one card. I wonder what other things they might not notice.
I don't think a tor proxy is even a tiny burden to Amazon's system so is it possible that they might offer us an ongoing deal which costs, say, $20Aus a year which would be tolerable for many of us?
Are there any other clouds which offer honeymoon deals like Amazon's?

Fair enough sort of.
When I encountered this list and the general references to Tor around the place there was far too much rumourmongering about exits and Tor in general scaring people away.
It is reasonable to be cautious but if everyone talks in general terms of fear and mayhem it is working against Tor and one wonders whether ISPs are some of those influenced by such unfounded stuff.

Isn't the idea to seed the prospective version for testing, hence the button to get it?
The button leads to the dud link.

Did you have a failed installation previously and the current effort is installing in a new directory so that when you click on the new one it is looking for a file for the browser profile, or something, in the original but incomplete set?
I had a similar problem until I searched and removed everything to do with all tor stuff.
good luck

Hi Dawood
What did you find in your Google research that didn't answer it?
Hi Kevin,
Does that mean questions asked here should have proof of this being the last resort or is this list to help people as the ad blurb says?

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor project website change 
A bit of time has passed since the feedback on the 'new' torproject website.
It appears nothing has changed there....
What is the plan here?
Should we accept changes as this one as 'normal'?
Udo You might as well. From the tone of the bulletins from headquarters it is their organisation and community and we are but fringe dwellers or an audience.

I see.
Is that helping tor?
It looks like the website maintainers do not understand tor well enough.
