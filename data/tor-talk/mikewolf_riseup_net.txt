Forcing RC4 is pretty common.  For all the web servers out there that
don't natively support TLS 1.1+, (RHEL/CentOS 5.x and 6.0 <= 6.4, Debian
Squeeze, etc), RC4 is the *only* cipher available that isn't vulnerable
to the BEAST attack.  I'd expect to continue seeing the use of
RSA_RC4_128_SHA until RHEL 5.x goes EOL in March 2017 and Debian Squeeze
goes EOL in Feb 2016.
Theoretically, all the major browsers have been patched and server
admins could stop restricting connections to RC4, but I have a feeling
that the companies that perform PCI scans (for credit card processing)
still fail servers for BEAST vulnerability if they don't force RC4 for
TLS 1.0.

This is what the wiki [1] has to say about it:
"You can very well decrease your anonymity by using VPN/SSH in addition
to Tor. (Proxies are covered in an extra chapter below.) If you know
what you are doing you can increase anonymity, security and privacy."
Each of the different combinations of [tor,vpn,ssh,proxy] are covered in
more detail on that page.

-- Unless the malware breaks out of the VM. [1]
 -- Not true.  You're assuming the malware is looking at your IP
address and then reporting it.  Well, it may... but the act of
connecting to another server to report your IP address exposes your
actual public IP address.
BTW, 192.168.1.50 is *also* not the IP address assigned by your ISP,
it's a local NAT address given out by your router.  If you could hide
behind NAT, you'd already be safe :)

Given that it's trivial to fix and you're a "security specialist", when
can we expect your patch to address the issue(s)?
It really isn't.  In fact, you're failing pretty hard at your mission to
discredit the project.  If you're the expert you claim to be, write a
patch or write a paper.  Trying to provoke panic on a mailing list by

Bonus points if you're "Z".

BTW, it was not lost on me that you failed to respond to anything I said

@_subject: [tor-talk] darkweb-everywhere - was: Using HTTPS Everywhere to 
I had an idea recently that might be an improvement (or might not?) on
the darkweb-everywhere concept.  What if we introduced an HTTP header
similar to HSTS -- `X-Onion-Address` perhaps -- which could be sent by
sites that wished to advertise their .onion address?  Just like HSTS,
the header would only be acted upon if received over HTTPS (we don't
want malicious parties injecting headers and redirecting people).
Future versions of TBB could perhaps automatically redirect users to the
.onion site when this header is present, or perhaps prompt users to
inform them of the hidden service.

I think the xxx.onion is sufficient.  We're simply telling the client
that the site is available at another location.  Perhaps there are cases
where additional data would be required (site is in a subdirectory of
the .onion domain?), but I haven't really thought about it.
I don't see any advantage to doing this.
I can see max-age being useful; includeSubdomains, probably not.
Apache, lighttpd, and nginx all support custom headers with simple
changes to their respective configuration files.  I would suggest coming
up with a better name for the header though; I believe the `X-` prefix
is no longer favored, but I don't remember the actual preferences.

@_author: Michael Wolf 
@_subject: [tor-talk] darkweb-everywhere - was: Using HTTPS Everywhere to 
I thought about that -- but I don't think much is at risk.  The browser
would receive the header on its first request to the site, before it
received any links to advertising or loaded additional resources from
third parties.  If the browser immediately drops the connection and
opens a new connection to the .onion site, what has anyone learned that
they didn't already know?  The target site saw a connection from an exit
node, and then a connection to the hidden service, so it can assume that
this is the same person... but how is that any worse than you continuing
to connect to them over clearnet?  The third parties never see a
connection until after the page has loaded from the .onion domain, so
there's no contamination there.  Am I missing something?
Agreed.  The redirect probably shouldn't be automatic anyway, unless the
user specifically configures it that way with an user preference
somewhere.  A once-per-session prompt with a "Don't ask me again"
checkbox would be nice.

You don't trust vfemail.net to give you their proper .onion address over
https?  Why would you trust a third party more?  It may be a matter of
preference, but I feel the opposite about it.  I consider "some trusted
site" to be a single point of failure, a desirable target to be
exploited, and unnecessary overhead.  Who would manage the site?  How
would you get your site listed?  How do you ensure that people don't
list .onion sites for clearnet sites that they don't control?  It seems
like a lot of additional effort compared to adding one line in an
.htaccess file.  I just don't see any benefit at all of having a third
party handle this.

Adding a header is one line in an .htaccess file for Apache.  It's one
line in a configuration file for nginx as well.  The instructions for
telling people to add this header would be the same for every site using
Apache/nginx, respectively.  'Simply check[ing] if the client IP is a
Tor exit node, and then advertis[ing] the availability of the hidden
service to such users' is not nearly as simple (definitely not a
'one-liner'), and would require a unique/custom solution for nearly
every site.
Checking for exit node IP addresses can also fail.  Records are not
always fresh, some exit nodes use a different IP address for incoming
vs. outgoing traffic, and some users may be using a VPN after tor (even
if it is a bad idea), giving a false negative.  The header has none of
these problems.  The header is a simple advertisement that the site
offers its content at an .onion domain.  The user agent (or plugin) is
free to use or ignore this information as it pleases.  It's simple, it
doesn't fail, and it doesn't require additional interaction with a third
party (no DNS requests leaking who is connecting to a site...).

Would it be difficult to either:
A.  Send a random ID with each request
B.  Treat the ID almost like a session cookie.  When the session ends,
so does the ID.
Obviously neither option will be very useful for sites that make you
authorize each new browser you connect (like banks, facebook, etc)...
but for the random snoopy site wouldn't this be sufficient?

Please don't use Tor for this.  Use a proxy or VPN.  Streaming
high-quality video uses way too much bandwidth, and it doesn't seem like
you actually need the anonymity that Tor provides.

Nobody is suggesting that Tor be limited to "serious journalists,
activists or whistle blowers..."  I /am/ suggesting that in most cases
it's inconsiderate and unnecessary to use Tor for streaming Netflix, a
high-bandwidth entertainment service that you typically pay for using a
method linked to your identify.  Perhaps Mr. Henry has found a way to
pay anonymously or has some unique circumstances.  For most streamers, a
VPN will perform better while achieving the same goals, without taxing
the tor network.
