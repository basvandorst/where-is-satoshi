Hmm, I don't have any especially good comments right now, but it
does seem potentially worthwhile investigating adding configuration
options for this for hidden services which don't care about keeping
the endpoints anonymous from each other, just from everyone else.

Keep in mind that colo/rent-a-server and cable/DSL at home aren't
the only possibilities; I run my own mail server on a machine located
in my home and have done so since about 2000 - since 2005 it's been on a T1
circuit with a 99.99% SLA, which has worked flawlessly, and before that it
was variously on ADSL with static IP and dorm-room ethernet back before
filtering such things got very common.
With consumer-targeted internet service dynamic addresses can be a problem,
but IIRC it's usually possible to get a static one or use dynamic DNS.
Port-filtering and weird traffic shaping is the real problem; I've been
refusing to deal with such and insisting on spending for the T1 ever since
an unpleasant encounter with an ISP that blocked outgoing TCP port 22.

Remind me to stay well clear of your jurisdiction.
In practice, on the few downtime events I have had with power outages or
machine problems and such, I've mostly not had problems with servers not
queueing and resending, but I have seen some mailing lists give up on
delivering to my account and had to unsub/resub.
Yes, local mail spool is nice, and so is being able to just write one's

Well, there is an advantage to co-lo in that if they raid your home they'll
probably seize anything more technologically sophisticated than an abacus,
whereas with the co-lo you'll just lose that server, at least in that raid.
On the other hand, yeah, I don't know if there's a difference in terms of
the amount of effort for them to get at it.  You could also make it more
of a hassle for them to follow up by putting it in a colo in a different
country than your residence.  What one *really* wants is a way to get colo
anonymously and then harden the server against snooping in case they do seize
it, but that seems fairly tricky to arrange since there's both the payment and
the need to physically deliver the server as potential identity leaks.
I think with colo it would be reasonably possible to be assured of knowing
about it if it's tampered with, though.  You could design something with a
tamper-evident case so you'd know if it were opened or removed from the rack,
you could ssh into it from your home machine and have a high-resolution
probe of whether it's running or not, and so on.  If you're particularly
paranoid and up for a little hardware design, put an audio recorder
or other suitable monitoring device on a PCIe card with a battery or supercap
to charge up from the bus and then keep it running while the machine is shut

Seconded; you can't trust VMs on hardware you don't control for anything
that needs to stay private - at least not until we get Turing-complete
emulated processors implemented in homomorphic cryptography.  At minimum you
need a real machine in a colo, which means you need to figure out how to
pay for it anonymously [1], and if you want a second line of defense you
want to harden your server against intrusions too; doing your disk crypto
in tamper-proof hardware would probably be a good idea [2], as would making
sure you can trust your BIOS [3].
[1] prq.se claims they work with anonymous clients on their web site,
but all the methods of payment they mention are identity leak hazards.
[2] I don't think the kernel supports this, though :/

This is all just wrong.  It's wildly implausible that *any* amount of
computational power the NSA will *ever* have will attack such large
key spaces by brute force.  On average, you have to search half the key
space, so 2^127 keys, to break the cipher.  Let's be insanely overgenerous
by a factor of at least a few thousand and suppose 1 'operation' == 1 key
tested, so your 10 exaflop machine can test 10^19 keys/second.  Then it
needs (2^127)/(10^19) seconds on average to brute force a 128-bit key, or
twice that in the worst case.  That's 539 billion years.  The sun will reach
its red giant phase and engulf the Earth before it gets through even one
percent of the keyspace.
Furthermore, thermodynamic constraints apply: for every bit of non-reversible
computation output, one must expend energy 4*k*T, where k is Boltzmann's
constant and T is the absolute temperature.  The lowest you can plausibly
take T is equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background (2.73 K), since
you would need to expend more energy for cooling to maintain a lower
temperature.  Thus, every non-reversible bit of output needs at least 1.51 *
10^-22 J of input energy.  Forget cryptography for the moment; consider just
cycling a 128-bit counter through all of its possible values.  Adding one to
a number always changes 1 bit, changes another half of the time, and so on,
so we have 2^0 + 2^-1 + ... + 2^-128 = 2 * (1 - 2^-129) irreversible bit
outputs per counter value, times 2^128 values gives us 2^129 - 1 bits expended,
or 1.03 * 10^17 J.  Not a totally implausible amount of energy, but a rather
large one, roughly one day's worth of output for all the power plants in the
world - actually doing crypto ops that many times would need thousands of
times more, and current hardware is many orders of magnitude away from being
able to even approach fundamental physical limits on computational efficiency.
It also nicely demonstrates that 128-bits is about as far is it goes for
brute force even being theoretically possible within the known laws of physics;
brute-forcing a 256-bit key would consume far more energy than is available
in the observable universe.
Summarizing more concisely, there's no possible way the NSA can attack 128-
bit keys by brute force.  The more plausible dangers are that they know a
cryptanalytic attack not known in the public literature that can break ciphers
like AES more efficiently than that, and being certain of security in such
cases is very hard because proving lower bounds on computational complexity is
very hard [1], or that they're far beyond the capabilities of publicly known
hardware at building quantum computers and can apply Grover's algorithm in
a large but not impossible 2^64 operations.
[1] Since you can test whether a key is correct in polynomial time using two
blocks of ciphertext, search for keys is in NP and being able to rigorously
prove security for a block cipher would imply P != NP as a corollary.

Apologies; I have slightly mis-spoken here.  This implication would only
hold if the problem were NP-complete, which I do not believe is known to
be the case for any cipher.  Proving such lower bounds is still, however,
beyond the capabilities of present mathematics.

I would move out of the US rather than submit to such an order; I don't
think I'm the only one of us who would.  That said, the Tor network *is*
vulnerable to attempts to suppress the relay operators and directory
authorities, which are more dangerous than attacks on the developers -
one can release software pseudonymously easily enough.
The directory authority attack vector could be weakened by adding support
for DAs as hidden services and moving a voting plurality of them to HSes.
Recently, Jake and I talked about some ideas for a more radical change,
eliminating the DAs *as servers* and just having them intermittently
poll directory mirrors to learn descriptors for new routers and upload
their votes.  I think there will be effective defense strategies for the
DAs if it should become necessary.
The hardest problem, I think, is defending against attempts to suppress
relays by legal force; the current model of total connectivity means it's
trivial to enumerate the IPs of all relays.

I think "flood the network with slow connections" is a mis-read; they
seemed to be speaking of slow nodes that falsely advertise high bandwidth,
an attack which won't work since we now cap unmeasured bandwidths to
20 kbit/sec IIRC.
Their evident interest in this sort of thing suggests we should examine
the bwauth system more closely to be sure the node can't distinguish a
bwauth measurement from other connections, though - otherwise they could
still manipulate the path selection weights like that.

@_subject: [tor-talk] x.509 for hidden services 
For defense in depth on the HS side, it's best to run the HS Tor on a
different machine, or at least a different VM, than the HS server, so
that if the HS server software is owned, the HS private key isn't
compromised.  The setup you describe would prevent that configuration;
consider allowing, in addition to self-signed certs, a certificate chain
where the root is a CA certificate matching the HS key in the manner you
describe and signing a certificate using a different key for the service
to use.
As for the migration to elliptic curves, I think the most serious problem
you'll encounter is that the curve we end up using may not be one that has
a standardized OID or is widely supported in X.509 implementations - e.g.,

Yes, and that is what it looks like.  The strings 'code', 'old' and 'fail' in
the URLs seen in nachash's logs were also present as top-level directories on
his site, and he apparently had a 404 redirect to his index page - so a
buggy crawler might well produce something like the observed pattern.  Who
would leave an obviously broken crawler producing nothing of interest like
that running for such a long time and O(1M) requests, though?  An attack
designed to look like skiddie bullshit is starting to sound plausible.
