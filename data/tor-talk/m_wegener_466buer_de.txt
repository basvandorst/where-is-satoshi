@_subject: [tor-talk] hiddden service  on openwrt 
Hi there!
I was wondering wether it is possible to run a hidden service, using an openwrt router :)
As i did not find any information on this I`m about to compile it for openwrt, see if it works out.
Did someone give tor on openwrt a try?
Having a tor repo for openwrt would be awesome! :)

atm, I`m on a TP-Link WR841ND, V9.1
You are right, there is a tor version of openwrt here:
as this is under "oldpackages" (sept. 2014) I don know wether this package might get updated or not.
Right now, I'm creating the Openwrt - cross compile enviroment, takes longer than excpeted; though I keep beeing patient :)
