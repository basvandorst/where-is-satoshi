As the router for a VirtualBox internal network, ra's Tor gateway VM
 does basically what you describe.  You could route
that to a physical NIC on the host.  Or you could replicate the setup in
a Soekris etc box.  JanusVM  might also work for
you.  Basically, it's a VM running Tor that you access through an
OpenVPN tunnel.

Responding to criticism about cooperating with the US investigation of
LulzSec, HideMyAss said: "Regarding censorship bypassing, some have
stated it is hypocritical for us to claim we do not allow illegal
activity, and then claim our service is used in some countries to bypass
censorship illegally. Again we follow UK law, there isn?t a law that
prohibits the use of Egyptians gaining access to blocked websites such
as Twitter, even if there is one in Egypt ? though there are certainly
laws regarding the hacking of government and corporate systems."  See
One precaution might be to choose VPN services in jurisdictions
unfriendly to your own.  Perhaps Russian VPN services would more likely
cooperate with Syria?  Would US ones be less likely?

I also routinely run TAILS as a VM.  In VirtualBox, after creating the
VM, one can delete the hard disk and boot from the ISO file.  It's not
an issue for me because the host (1) is under my control and (2) uses
encrypted LVM.  I wouldn't otherwise run TAILS as a VM.

Using encrypted LVM, swap (everything except boot) is encrypted.  Still,
amnesia requires shutting down the host.  If total amnesia is important,
you can turn off swap, write zeros to it, and then turn it back on again.

Assume that the Zetas have full admin access for all local and regional

very well, run relays, and routinely communicate through it.
How safe would it be, in those areas, to access Tor through bridges?

Arguably, the prudent threat model is that the Zetas will kill you if
they learn that you're using Tor.  They can access available resources
for finding bridge addresses .
And they may have connection logs, so provisional obscurity isn't

OK, I get the distinction.  It would have been more accurate for me to
say "attacks on hidden-service sites".
That's good to know.
I didn't mean that people are intentionally DDoSing the Tor network.  I
meant that the attacks on hidden-service sites may have spillover
effects.  Let's say that SlowLoris attacks bog Apache serving some
hidden-service site.  With enough attackers, could the site's entry
guards become bogged?
Also, once hidden-service sites have bogged, are they flagged as
unresponsive by their entry guards, or elsewhere in the Tor network?
Indeed.  Thank you.

Freedom Hosting  seems to be "
Enemy Number One".  I've been monitoring its availability, and I'm
puzzled by the results.
So, I open a few instances of TAILS 0.8.1 routed via VPN services to
various exit IP addresses.  All of them can load my private test sites,
with typical delays of a minute or so.  However, all of them report
"Proxy error: 504 ... General SOCKS server failure" for the Freedom
Hosting site, and they do so immediately, with no lag.  These are LiveCD
instances, by the way, so there's no local Polipo cache.
Conversely, using an old Tor installation, freshly booted, the Freedom
Hosting site comes up, with typical delay of a minute or so.
What might be causing that behavior?

I'll be happy to help.  However, I don't think that it's fundamentally a
Tails issue.  I see the same immediate 504 error for FH with a recent
Ubuntu installation running Tor 0.2.2.33 with Firefox 3.6.23 and
Torbutton 1.4.4.1.  Using Ra's Tor fast gateway 0.0.1 (with Tor
0.2.1.24) and Ubuntu with Firefox, I get a different error: "The
connection was reset".  It's also immediate, with no network lag.  And
all the while, my old Tor installation (running Tor 0.2.2.33) is loading
FH just fine.

Alternatively, one could run Tor on VMs that can only access the
internet via OpenVPN-based "anonymity services".  OpenVPN clients can be
run on physical routers, with tunnels routed to physical LANs that lack
management access.  Even if attackers manage to compromise VM hosts,
getting real external IPs also requires compromising the routers.  One
can readily extend this approach using nested OpenVPN tunnels.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden service security w. Apache/Win32 
It would be very dangerous to use Windows in any way for running hidden
services!  Run Linux and VirtualBox on your host machine.  Ubuntu is
probably best if you're new to Linux.  Have your host machine access the
Internet through a reputable multi-hop VPN service, and firewall it to
prevent leaks.  That way, even if something goes wrong with your Tor
setup, you're not leaking from your real IP address.  Run Tor on a
router VM, as a transparent proxy, and run Apache on a Linux VM.  LAMP
setup in Ubuntu is trivial.
If you need Windows, it would be best to use another machine.  If you
must use the same machine, run Windows as a VM.  In that case, you'll
want to use a gateway VM (e.g., pfSense) for your VPN connection
(firewalled to prevent leaks).  That way, Windows won't be advertising
the same IP address that Tor is using.

They didn't "crack Tor's encryption".  They posted a fake "Tor security
update" on one of the Hidden Wiki pages.  It was actually malware that
sent true IP addresses to their server(s) when Tor wasn't running.
TAILS would have prevented that, because there's no history.  Using a
Tor gateway VM would have prevented that, because there's never Internet
connectivity except through Tor.  Connecting to Tor through a VPN
service would have provided a safety net (to the extent that the VPN
provider protects users' privacy).

If it really matters that they not be aware of each other, I recommend
accessing each one in a separate VM.  But that will seriously eat up
resources.  Unless you're using Tor, you'll also want to use VPN
services so VMs don't share the same IP address.
