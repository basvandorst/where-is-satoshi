@_subject: tor block list 
Dear TOR block-list administrator,
If you are blocking TOR nodes primarily for IRC users, then you should
be aware the TOR nodes are individually configurable as to which
destinations they allow.  Some TOR nodes don't allow *any* outgoing
traffic -- they only act as middlemen between other TOR nodes.
Attached is an example perl script which can parse through tor exitpoint
rules and show which nodes allow access to a particular port (say one of
the IRC ports), and which nodes do not.
Currently, less then 60% of tor nodes allow outgoing connections to port
6667.  By comparison, 67% allow outgoing connections to port 80, and
none allows outgoing connections to port 25.
So I don't think a single list will cover all uses.  Rather then
disallowing connections from a system because it happens to be a TOR
node, take into consideration what the exit policy is of the node.

@_subject: tor block list 
Then still you gain nothing by blocking tor nodes which do not allow any outgoing connections.  There should be no technical reason to block hosts with no exitpoints.   That should be easy to fix, and it doesn't require separate lists.
I'd say it is guaranteed to cause false positives the way it is now.  100% false positives for SMTP as of a couple hours ago when I last checked -- there were a total of 0 tor nodes that allowed exit to SMTP This kind of service..  Sounds like an evil group.  Maybe we could call them 'red commie bastard' servers for greater effect.  Tor and SMTP are entirely separate, even if they come from the same IP address.
On the flip side of that flip side, I don't envy your job, because services which provide blocking lists are tasked with a job of not producing false positives, just like my spam filter.  Sure, it would be easier if you never had to fine-tune blocking -- you could do like a certain company and block all of Europe..  But just like my spam filter, false positives tend to upset customers, and I know that if my spam filter starts dropping mail from my friends, I do something about it, including finding something better.
I had a talk with someone from one of the IRC servers recently because they were getting unwanted traffic from my tor server as an endpoint.  The person reporting the problem had suggested that I block IRC ports or else my server would get blocked by his network.  But the way I see it is that there are hundreds of IRC networks, and blocking access to all IRC ports would be dumbing down the connection options to whatever the least tolerant network wanted.  I'd rather see my node blocked by IRC networks that don't want anonymous traffic, because I expect that there will be some that do allow it!
So, I have nothing against some networks blocking IRC connections from tor nodes with IRC exitpoints, like mine.  But if my server's other connections are wrongfully blocked, then I'll try to educate the users on finding better solutions.  That's why I think it is in both of our interests to have your lists used for the right purpose.

@_subject: blocking google groups [was Re: ExitPolicy abuse] 
I also got a report recently from someone about UUNet abuse through Google.  Apparently they had reported it to google, but never got an answer (not surprising, in my experience google is very slow to respond to mail, if they ever respond).  I think the problem lies with google - they are acting as a proxy from HTTP -> UUNet and not filtering spam along the way.
So until google fixes the problem, I've rejected access to google's network.  I don't know how many ways groups.google.com may be accessed, but my first stab is to block 216.239.37.0/24 , which contains the 3 servers listed right now in DNS.
Perhaps over time we're going to have to build up a list of networks that are wide open for abuse, like google groups, which we may want to block in a default exit policy..

@_subject: blocking google groups [was Re: ExitPolicy abuse] 
Right, meant Usenet..   I would expect that google will also get bad publicity if they do nothing and act as an anonymous gateway for spam to usenet.  The same way that TOR gets bad publicity on certain IRC networks because it is used as a gateway for abuse.  Or hotmail for spam, etc, etc.
Perhaps Usenet readers will block all messages from google.com, similar to how some IRC networks block all connections for TOR nodes...
dig groups.google.com gives:
;; ANSWER SECTION:
groups.google.com.      860     IN      CNAME   groups.google.akadns.net.
groups.google.akadns.net. 216   IN      A       216.239.37.104

groups.google.akadns.net. 216   IN      A       216.239.37.147
I can confirm that when I load a browser and type in "groups.google.com", it connected to one of those IP addresses..  So the exitpolicy block should work...

@_subject: tor eating CPU time 
I upgraded to 0.0.9.3 last weekend, and it dropped tor's average CPU usage by almost half.
However thing have been slowly getting worse.  Saturday stats show about 30% CPU average usage, increasing slowly to a little over 40% on Wed, then about 50% by Thursday, and about 12 hours ago tor jumped to 100% cpu usage and has not taken a rest since then.
The strange thing is that this doesn't correlate with traffic served.  Tor traffic has been steadily averaging about 200k/sec, and started dropping about 12 hours ago by as much as a factor of 2 (much higher variation though).  So, CPU time increased, but network traffic decreased...
Looking through my server monitoring logs, I don't see any correlation against network usage or number of open TCP connections.   I'm about to restart TOR, but before I get into the habbit of periodic restarts, is there anything I can do to get information about the problem?
In case it helps, here are the messages from warnings.log from about the time when the CPU usage first pegged at 100%  (the cpu pegged at about 15:50 server local time +- 10 minutes):

Over the last few hours, the amount of tor traffic to/from my server has reduced by about 2 orders of magnitude.  There is nothing in the logs but this (probably because I had been changing accounting rules recently):
Jan 29 04:58:49.868 [warn] configure_accounting(): Mismatched accounting interval; starting a fresh one.
The number of established network connections has dropped from about 400 down to about 100..  So it is still doing something, just not much..  Does tor log anything when it is hibernating?  Or perhaps it is just tired?

@_subject: Anonymous/Nonymous Communication Coexisting? 
Some clients will let you specify configuration based on the url.  For example with firefox, you could create a configuration file which contains:
function FindProxyForURL(url, host)
Then in Firefox, go to preferences / general and in the Connection settings, set "Automatic proxy configuration URL" to "file://[path to your config file]".  I use a proxy configuration file, but I haven't tested this with '.onion' rules..
Or you can do it the other way, have a list of domains that it is ok to use directly, and have everything else go through the privoxy proxy. Some examples of ways to test, not recommendations:
if( dnsDomainIs(host, '.freshmeat.net')  dnsDomainIs(host, 'sourceforge.net') // pick up "
 dnsDomainIs(host, '.sourceforge.net') // for "
 (host == '127.0.0.1')

@_subject: reconsidering default exit policy 
Both of your arguments are biased by a very different view then that of
a system administrator.  There are two target audiences here --
anonymous users and server administrators.  The policy choices which are
ideal for one group are probably not ideal for the other.
Once apon a time systems shipped with all services publically visible
and no firewalls, because if there was no known exploits (positive
reasons to filter), then they may as well be enabled.  That was
convenient from a user's view.  However as we all know by now, that
turned out to be bad from a server administrators point of view.
Consider you want to entice system admin A to host a tor server.  Sure,
you could tell him that this is a cool funky 90's retro service which
will proxy basically everything to everywhere unless he figures out how
to limit it down to reduce the blacklisting mail, server attacks, and
usenet spam reports he gets.  Although as an administrator I prefer to
see systems that come online with minimal necessary functionality and
then let you enable things from there as you become comfortable with them.
This default policy choice doesn't have to be set in stone.  As tor
becomes more stable and abuse-prone services (like google's usenet
proxy) figure out how to deal with anonymous access, then I suspect the
default policy can become less restrictive without causing more
frustration to a server administrator.

Your generalization is false.  Take this case for example -- anonymous
users of Tor are not necessarily the tor operators.
To demonstrate, how about I set my firewall to block Tor ports?  I think
that is a much better demonstration.  I can effectively handle all
complaints by setting up an email alias for /dev/null.

@_subject: reconsidering default exit policy 
I have mixed feelings about the best default exit policy for TOR, which is why I'm playing devil's advocate and making sure other views are considered.  But no software maker (or other service provider) should ever feel justified in punishing their user, whether they have RTFM or not.  That is just bad business.
It helps us all if TOR is widely distributed.  That means we should hope it will be also run by those who don't know much about TOR, internet workings, or usenet abuse, but who have extra bandwidth and want to help.  It also means there will probably be many people who aren't native english speakers which adds an extra level of complexity to RTFM.  Letting people "suffer the consequences" because they didn't understand to the same depth as the people on this list would be Since we are asking people to donate resources, if they have problems then we have problems.  So by punishing them, we punish ourselves.  For that reason, I think the default exit policy should be chosen to minimize the trouble caused to site operators.  The more technically able operators can RTFM and see how to widen their exit policy further.
How about this as a litmus test:  will the vast majority of people on this list be using the default exit policy as-is without any further reject entries?  If not, then I think it is not a good starting point for new TOR server operators.   We should eat our own dog food.  Personally, I would not use the default exit policy as currently proposed without additional reject lines - concerning usenet abuse through google's usenet proxy as the prime example..

I whipped up a small script last month when I got some complaints about
IRC abuse.  I wanted to find out how many tor exitpoints there were for
:6667.   I think I posted it at one point, but since it is a small
script I'll attach it again.  It only looks for accept/reject lines
which match all networks (the form '[accept|reject] \*:(\d+)-?(\d+)?')
The only two sources of complaints that I've had so far have been from
IRC abuse and from usenet abuse via google.  The IRC networks seem to
have figured out ways to deal with Tor users, although I was intending
to allow IRC exit points anyway because there are many IRC networks, and
some may still accept anonymous connections.
For the google problem, I've been blocking by address rather then by
port.  So I've blocked a large range of google addresses which contained
the groups.google.com ips.  But I just checked now and it looks like
groups.google.com maps into a new set of addresses then last month, so
looks like I may just keep adding more of google's IP range(s) to my
reject lines.
sigh...  I guess being on blacklists isn't so bad though..  One thing
I've noticed though is that I get a lot more worms/zombies trying to use
my web server as a proxy.  They must assume that because I am on a
particular blacklist that my web server allows proxying.  Amusing in a
way, but it was causing my firewall logs to grow rapidly (which showed
up as a secondary effect on my server's temperature log from extra disk
IO)..  so it is official, tor contributes to global warming :-)
I remember hearing someone talk about asking their google friends what
they were going to do about anonymous abuse, but that's the last I heard.

Well I am still happy with my tor server in the US.  Tor has been
running reasonably well lately (minus last week), and after the first
round of complaints related to IRC and google when I first started, is
hasn't been too much of a problem to deal with.
This is what nearly caused me to drop tor.  Not because it was crashing,
but because it was failing in such a way that it was disrupting other
As I reported a while back, tor would slowly (over about a week)
increase cpu usage until it became cpu bound, even though the network
load hadn't increased.  When it starts eating so much system resources
that it degrades performance of my other services, that's when it
becomes a problem.  But after watching it carefully for a while and
eventually setting a daily accounting limit cycle, that gives tor a rest
most nights and I haven't seen the same problem lately.  Tor failed in
another strange way last week, but this time with 0% cpu and no network
traffic served (the processes were still running, no errors reported). I
noticed after 4 days and restarted.
My server is remotely hosted, so this hasn't been an issue for me.  But
this would prevent me from running tor on my home machines.
Tor seems more stable lately.  As long as it doesn't cause problems for
my other (higher priority) services, then I'll just restart it if I
notice a problem after a periodic check of the traffic logs.

Yes, 0.9.9 has problems.  Two hours ago, tor went nuts.  When I logged onto the machine, I found 65 tor processing running.  They were each listed as having a resident size of approx 7-8mb each, totaling 440mb of memory being used.  The entire system was in deep swap mode, which may have limited further spawning of tor processes.
The oldest process was from May 24th, so it has been a few days since tor last acted up and I had to restart it.  I am also thinking of going to automated restarts, although I find that solution very saddening (it reminds me of running a Windows server).
