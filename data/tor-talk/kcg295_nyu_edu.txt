@_subject: [tor-talk] Guard Selection 
Hello everyone,
I've read through the path selection specification document and I am a
bit confused about guard selection. It says that (when guard nodes are
enabled) "Tor maintains an ordered list of entry nodes as one's chosen
guards and stores the list persistently to disk. If a guard node becomes
unusable, rather than replacing it, Tor adds new guards to the end of
the list. When choosing the first hop of a circuit, Tor chooses at
random from among the first 3 (by default) usable guard on the list."
How is this list derived? What is it ordered by? How many guards are in
this list? Are guards added to the list with probability proportional to
their bandwidth, as with other types of node selection? Am I safe in
assuming that this is a local list unique to the client?
Sorry if these questions are a bit basic or if I missed the answers
elsewhere. Thanks for your time!

Thanks! Another question:
Is the path selection document at the root of that repo current?
Thanks again,

@_subject: [tor-talk] Node Down and Old Version Notifications 
Hello everyone,
The other day I got a really helpful e-mail. It seems a person named Paul wrote a program to check the PGP key servers and e-mail people to let them know that their keys are about to expire. After updating my key I thought about how an approach like this on the Tor consensus could be used to notify people when their Tor node goes down, or when their version of Tor is out of date and therefore their node becomes "not Though such a tool might be useful, I wonder if it is in the spirit of Tor. I know that a lot of people obfuscate their e-mail when running a Tor node (using AT instead of  etc.), and I'm sure part of the reason this is being done is because they don't want to be contacted by bots. However, maybe they would want to be notified if their node went down or was out of date.
Are there any thoughts on whether or not a tool like this is a good idea? If people think it's in the spirit of Tor I'm willing to sit down and try to write it up.

Interesting! My node never got any of these notifications. I wonder why that is. I'll check this out!
