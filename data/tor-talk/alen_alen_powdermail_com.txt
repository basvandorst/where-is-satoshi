I ran across AORTA as a potentially improved replacement for Torsocks.
Note to the author of AORTA (Rob van der Hoeven), I've had AORTA to  work on CentOS 7 which shows a kernel version 3.10 but RedHat often  backports lots of features into older versioned software. This might  be worth noting on the webpage.
**Did anyone else check out AORTA or review its code? Not so much a  coder here, I would like to listen to community response/review of  this tool.
I had one (chroot?) situation it worked better than Torsocks. But the  author doesn't go into detail about his technique of Torification vs.  Torsocks. How does it work? Why is it supposed to work under more  Also wonder, what exactly the software does when testing if "Tor  handles all Internet traffic"? Is it necessary, what are the  consequences of using -c to disable the test?

I think these are its rules, copied from aorta.c, any opinions from experts?
const char *aorta_rules[] =
     // create an aorta chain inside the nat table
     "-t nat -N aorta",
     // DNS queries for onion addresses are resolved to an address in the
     // TOR_ONION_NETWORK range. traffic in this network must always be
     // processed by the local Tor daemon
     "-t nat -A aorta -p tcp -m tcp -d " TOR_ONION_NETWORK " -j  REDIRECT --to-ports " TOR_TCP_PORT,
     // do not touch non-routable addresses, except for DNS traffic
     "-t nat -A aorta -d 127.0.0.0/8    -p udp -m udp ! --dport 53 -j RETURN",
     "-t nat -A aorta -d 127.0.0.0/8    -p tcp -m tcp ! --dport 53 -j RETURN",

Well, I'm not sure what is cause this:
$ aorta -c -t telnet abcd1234abcd1234.onion 80
WARNING NOT testing if Tor handles all Internet traffic.
RUNNING telnet abcd1234abcd1234.onion 80

telnet: connect to address fa93:ac5e:c801:b104:ad21:2e27:0f18:b4f:  Invalid argument

OTOH this works fine:
$ torsocks telnet abcd1234abcd1234.onion 80
Trying 127.39.20.0...
Connected to abcd1234abcd1234.onion.
Escape character is '^]'.
Why is AORTA failing, also why is result of trying to connect on IPV6  "Invalid argument"?

No, sorry, it's changed from the real address. The point was to observe
aorta timing out a connection while torsocks connecting ok. I found
unpredictable. But happening enough to create doubt in what aorta is
Well, you have discrepancies also. Why is the behavior different? Aren't
both connections going through same tor?
Doesn't telnet look for IPV6 if IPV4 fails? Where it got lookup, I can't
say. What does aorta do when IPV6 is requested?
