Quoting Lara (2015-03-05 17:34:06)
Right now you can not use bitmask over Tor, because up to now bitmask does VPN on udp only and Tor only routes tcp connections. There is plans for near future to support doing the VPN on tcp as well, what will solve this problem.
The other way around works fine. You can do Tor inside a bitmask VPN connection.  If you have bitmask a Tor in your machine that is what will happen.

I find really funny when people rant about things without even looking on what they are talking about.
Mailpile does not use node, it's written in python and all the javascript of it is for the browser. Up to now mailpile is in a beta status and is too soon to value if their distribution methods are trustworthy.
