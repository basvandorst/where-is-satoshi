Perhaps it is possible to detect typical P2P usage and ban it from the
tor network?

@_subject: How to define DNS name? 
You need to set an DNS A record pointing to your servers IP address and
configure it in your torrc file.
Extract from torrc:
     The IP or fqdn for this server. Leave commented out and Tor will
    guess.
    Address your-dns-a-record.yourdomain.com
If you don't own an domain name where you can edit the DNS records you
can register at a free DNS provider like dyndns.org or afraid.org.

@_subject: contradicting log entries regarding ExcludeNodes 
I am running a tor client on my laptop and a tor server (nami) on
another computer.
Most of the time the laptop and the server are using the same Internet
To avoid building a circuit starting at my laptops client and ending at
my server I added following line to my torrc:
ExcludeNodes nami,$3B1CD4DC4863DD1013E7C35A6F475C28946AB909
After reloading the config i can see following log entries:
Aug 14 03:42:54.973 [notice] Tor 0.2.0.4-alpha (r11023) opening log file.
Aug 14 03:42:56.727 [notice] We now have enough directory information to
build circuits.
Aug 14 03:42:56.745 [warn] You specified a server "nami" by name, but
this name is not registered, so it could be used by any server, not just
the one you meant. To make sure you get the same server in the future,
refer to it by key, as "$3B1CD4DC4863DD1013E7C35A6F475C28946AB909".
Aug 14 03:43:00.345 [notice] Tor has successfully opened a circuit.
Looks like client functionality is working.
Aug 14 03:45:06.111 [notice] We tried for 15 seconds to connect to
'[scrubbed]' using exit 'nami'. Retrying on a new circuit.
Aug 14 03:45:06.115 [notice] We tried for 15 seconds to connect to
'[scrubbed]' using exit 'nami'. Retrying on a new circuit.
I am a little bit confused:
Tor is warning me not to use the name "nami" because it is not
registered which means it is using my ExcludeNodes settings.
A moment later tor is trying to connect somewhere using exact the server
i did not want to use.
My (complete) torrc looks like this:
SocksPort 9050 # what port to open for local application connections
SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1 # accept connections only from localhost
ControlPort 9051
ExcludeNodes nami,$3B1CD4DC4863DD1013E7C35A6F475C28946AB909
Can anybody explain this to me?

Ok, no more Warnings.
Yes, i am sure this is my clients log file. I added 'SafeLogging 0' and
found this:
Aug 16 14:43:52.170 [notice] We tried for 15 seconds to connect to
'84.145.85.140' using exit 'nami'. Retrying on a new circuit.
'84.145.85.140' is my own webserver at this time (dynamic ip-address),
the same as running tor node 'nami'. I also noticed my ip-address
several times while checking ipchicken.com and whatismyip.com. I made
sure the browser is configured to use tor (which apparently is working
fine or i would not be able to see the notice stated above).
I still do not understand why my tor client is building circuits ending
at node 'nami' even if forbidden by ExcludeNodes.
Best regards

@_subject: Tor server "nami" taken by the German Police 
Hash: SHA1
just was informed by my Dad that the police is searching our Family
House. They took the machine running Tor exit node called "nami". Expect
it to be down for quite some time.
I do not know the details yet but will keep you informed.
