Yes. The best solution is to download Torbrowser from the Torproject website, or Tails at  Not only do either of these solutions work out of the box (in most cases), they also preserve anonymity.
Not unless you configure them to use Tor.

This looks really good! I can't wait to try it out once it's finished downloading. Just one question though, does it have a persistence option so that bridge/relay configurations can be preserved?
