@_subject: Last openssl update for Ubuntu breaks Tor 
i have/had problems with Tor 0.2.2.19-alpha and 0.2.1.27 (recompiled) after
the last openssl update under Ubuntu Maverick according "Ubuntu Security
Notice USN-1029-1, December 08, 2010, openssl vulnerabilities, CVE-2008-7270,
Both Tor versions crash with core dumps and the last line in info.log is:
"[info] cpuworker_main(): CPU worker exiting because Tor process closed
connection (either rotated keys or died)."
Because i'm running Tor in chroot, i deleted everything under /var/lib/tor
and replaced the openssl libs with the prior version from 30.11.2010
till this problem is solved. And now Tor works.

Hi Ted,
Yes, here the same: "Version: 0.9.8o-1ubuntu4.3"
Thank you for your input. Mmh, i don't know, what was false or doesn't work
as before, but i changed the libs again with the ones from 0.9.8o-1ubuntu4.3
this morning and now it works ;) So, i withdraw my statement - Tor
(0.2.2.19-alpha) works with the last OpenSSL version on Ubuntu :)
