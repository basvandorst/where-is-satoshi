@_subject: tls error messages 
In the infos.log of my tor server the following message is very often
found :
Nov 19 17:41:11.553 [info] connection_read_to_buf(): tls error. breaking
(nickname a_tor_server_name, address the_same_tor_server_IP_address).
Does it means that something wrong happens in the OR connection between
my tor server and the other tor server is it a normal message to inform that an OR connection has been
disconnected normaly ?
Thanks in advance.
tor 0.1.1.25
Kubuntu Linux 2.6.15-27

@_subject: being a middleman 
Hello Roger,
By the way, the wiki has a reference to "middleman"
"If you want to avoid most if not all abuse potential, set it to "reject
*:*". This is called being a "middleman" node"
May I take the liberty to remove  "This is called being a "middleman"
node" from the wiki ?

Hello !
I would like to understand why my tor server (clearstream) try to reach
the following servers on non usual tor ports ports (80, 443, 9001,
9030) ?
For example :
server IP 	port
12.30.222.10	9876
143.167.16.16	1731
18.244.0.188	9031	
What impact it has on my exit policy on my firewall ?
The server is running 0.1.1.23 on Linux in a DMZ behind an IPCOP
Many thanks in advance for your explanations !

@_subject: Error generating TOR web site 
Hello Roger,
Many thanks for your help,
Following your advices and reading the svn book (rtfm...) helps me a
lot !
The html pages are now generated without errors.
But ... I have some trouble with the links in the french generated html
documentation page.
Some of the links generated with "make" by wml files in the fr
directory, linking to pages in english, are pointing to .html and not
to .html.en files.
For example, pointing to
and not to The reference in the french and english wml file is the same :
  href="
The german documentation html file have the same behavior.
Do I miss something ? ( again ...)

Hello Marco,
Thanks for your quick answer.
If I understand well :
- tor administrators can use any port for their ORport and DIRport;
- as a consequence another tor server can ask my tor server to set-up a
OR or DIR link with it using any port;
- so if my tor server want to be able to answer requests from any other
tor server, I must have a totally open exit policy at my firewall.
Is this OK ?

Does being a middleman by using a reject *:* policy means :
- that only servers will connect you ?
- or servers and users will connect you (you are a middleman and an
entry point) ?
