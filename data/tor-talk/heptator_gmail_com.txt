@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor on Kindle 3G? 
Amazon offers free internet worldwide through their Kindle 3G
eReader/tablet (running some embedded Linux), however they proxy all
the 3G traffic through their servers. Apparently that means that even
if you try to establish a https connection to some server, it is
Amazon that establishes that secure connection on your behalf, and all
the traffic between you and the Amazon proxy can be easily monitored
by Amazon (which is probably what they are doing anyways). I would
like to ask if any of you has tried to deploy Tor on Kindle 3G. A more
general question is whether Tor can be easily deployed on embedded
linux devices (other than those running Android).
If to connect to the internet one is forced to use an untrusted proxy,
can Tor be of any help here? I.e. can Tor encrypt the data and hide
the final destination from the untrusted proxy while at the same time
having to pass the data through it?

No, I was asking about Kindle 3G (to be more precise Kindle Keyboard
3G - Fire is basically android and supports only wi-fi connection (not 3G),
so it should be straightforward to adapt Orbot to Fire. However Kindle
3G is some embedded linux, not android. The interesting thing about
Kindle 3G is that you get free internet worldwide (where 3G
connectivity is available) but at the cost of surrendering your
(browsing) privacy to amazon...

@_subject: [tor-talk] problem with cache preferences in TBB 
the IP anonymity test at  suggests that
browser.cache.memory.enable should be set to 'false'. in TBB from
about:config I set it to false but on every restart it is set again to
'true' (however this is not the case for browser.cache.disk.enable
which is also suggested by the test to be set to 'false'). Does
anybody know what settings to change such that the value is not reset
to 'true' on every restart of TBB? Also, is there any specific reason
why the above mentioned preferences are not set to 'false' by default
in TBB?
