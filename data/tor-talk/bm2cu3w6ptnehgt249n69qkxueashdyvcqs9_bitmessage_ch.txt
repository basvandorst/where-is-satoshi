@_subject: [tor-talk] Publishing Dangerous Data and Opinions 
Greetings tortalkers,
I have data with expert guidance which will result in death threats.
Ultimately, we will be killed for releasing this data with expert
guidance. We want to publish this data and stave off impending death for
as long as possible.
Are there field-tested guides for configuring a service in the most
anonymous way possible in order to publish files? I have scoured the
Internet and deep web for the past month and have not found a single
field-tested guide to doing so. We cannot trust a service or others to
carry out this data publication. Pointers are very much appreciated.

@_subject: [tor-talk] BBC Horizon: Inside the Dark Web 
until the pathologically press starved JA twins appeared-desperate for
relevance-almost decent was the episode. beyond me why tor continues to
fund and care about these two.
for jakey's nearly $100,000 salary, tor could hire fleet of half-drunk
russian coders to fix all bugs and flaws in the code. would cut down on
the amount of crapware produced by the same drunks and do the world a
oh, I apologize. directly from his IGF egofest, jakey is journalist now.
this begs the next quandry: why is tor paying journalist?  journalist for
who?  ...and where are all the good stories in the press...
