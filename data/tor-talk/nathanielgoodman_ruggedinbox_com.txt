@_subject: [tor-talk] Friendly LAN bridge -- bad idea? 
Around here all devices and usual guests use tor. This of course generates many direct connections to the tor network.
We were wondering if there would be any negative (privacy) implications from running a private bridge inside the LAN to which all the devices around here would then connect instead of making a direct connection to the network.
Waiting to hear your insights.
