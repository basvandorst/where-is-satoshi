@_subject: Tracking with etags 
Hash: SHA1
First, sorry if this has been mentioned before. I've searched and
haven't found any mention, but it seems too obvious to have not
already been reported.
Basically, client gets etag from server, client sends etag to server
next time it connects, server can associate client.
Might not sound significant, but if Gmail - for instance - gives
people Etag's, they - and anyone listening in on the connection - can
associate unanonnimized accounts with anonymized accounts.
I tested this on tor + privoxy and it worked.

Provided the people downloading warez contribute at least as much
resources as they use, it's good for tor surely?
