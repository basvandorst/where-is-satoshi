@_subject: tor path length 
Hi all,
I've setup a private Tor network to do some testing on. I'm trying to find out how to change the default path length to a client specified value. I'm interested in both values less and greater than the default.
If anyone can point me to the documentation that would be great.
I did notice the attribute 'NumEntryGuards NUM' but don't think that is what I need.
Is this hardcoded into the executable? Will I have to modify the source
to allow this?
Express yourself wherever you are. Mobilize!

So if I wanted to modfiy a client proxy (assume this is modifed to allow 1 hop) to do one hop, will the other

@_subject: puppetor setup 
I've just recently found out about the Framework Puppetor
and am trying to get the AccessingPublicWebServerOverTor example
working. However, I seem to have hit a snag.
When I execute the program I get this error:
Feb 12, 2008 10:57:21 PM de.uniba.wiai.lspi.puppetor.impl.ProxyNodeImpl startNode
WARNING: Could not start Tor process! Tor exited with exit value 255! Please go check the config options in /home/skaoth/workspace/TorTest/test-env/1202885841439/proxy/torrc manually!
Feb 12, 2008 10:57:21 PM de.uniba.wiai.lspi.puppetor.impl.NetworkImpl startNodes
WARNING: Starting nodes was not successful in 5 seconds.
The torrc file generated seems simple enough

Anyone have any ideas why this might be happening. I'm running in a VMWare instance and TOR seems to be working.
I'm not currently set set as a relay.
I've also go questions about PuppeTor as far as simulating exit-node policies
and was wondering where/who/list to contact
Appreciate any help
