@_subject: [tor-talk] web browser add-on extensions vulnerabilities 
Tor Browser users:
NoScript and other popular Firefox add-ons open millions to new attack
TB supplies default extensions, from which two are TB project's own and should
be subjected to an extension review process like those vetted by Mozilla.
The researchers provide a CROSSFIRE tool to analyze them.

Of course, one more reason to be careful about using add-ons in TB.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser update 
When I start Tor Browser it displays a message that it is establishing
a connection to Tor network.
After that I can request "Check for Tor Browser update ..." from Torbutton or
from menu Help - About Tor Browser display and eventually obtain it without
"Test Tor Network Settings" verification (that is, the Tor circuit's and my IP
addresses not visible thru Torbutton selection yet).
I would tend to think that Tor browser should be tested and anonimized first
(that is configured) before initiating any communication with the outside world, even if it is a Tor Project site.
Is that by design or something that should be fixed ?
Tor Browser 5.5.2 on Linux.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why my tor-assigned IP address differs from that of exit 
sometimes when I start the browser and execute "Test Tor Network Settings"
on Welcome Page, I get an IP address that differs from that of exit node (as
displayed thru Torbutton).
Why does it happen, and is it something to worry about or a bug ?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browsers - problem with sequencial runs 
I have both TB 7.0.2 and TB 7.5a2 installed separately (different dirs) -
they are
fully different apps.
I do NOT run them in parallel as that would normally cause a problem.
But I do sometimes run them one after another by starting and closing e.g.
TB TB 7.5a2 and after a few hours trying to start start 7.0.2 which then
reports an error due to being unable to connect to Tor (when I quit and
restart, sometimes twice, I am
able to connect, but have to "CONNECT"-configure as if on first run after
I do not have any related custom configurations.
I think I should be able to do it - these browser runs are independent and
should not know about each other (presumably thru some run-related
uninitialized data structures).

Hi Kathy,
There is a way to collect run-time info (what's being executed)
by means of strace Linux command (the output is meant for
a programmer, so do not be intimidated by it).
Make sure you have strace installed:
$ which strace
You will have to start TB from inside its installation dir
(fill in your own dir):
$ strace -o tb-strace.out
tb-strace.out is your run-time log file in text format.
Just do your browsing.
When you get stuck, try to close TB by usual means, and then
eventually kill it by PID as you described.
Upon TB exit, you have tb-strace.out file to look up for clues
 (let somebody review it, or attach it to a problem report).
