@_subject: [tor-talk] Wired Story on Uncovering Users of Hidden Services. 
A recent story in Wired is entitled "Visit the Wrong Website and the FBI Could End Up in Your Computer" by Kevin Poulsen ( The story involves the FBI uncovering the IP addresses of numerous users of a Tor hidden I know this was mentioned previously ( but I am interested in a different aspect.
Within the story, there is a link to a PDF of an application for a search warrant ( which provides illuminating reading (parts are a bit disgusting as they refer to the content of the hidden service which was serving child In short, the FBI arrested the owner of the hidden service, took over the server, then installed a "Network Investigative Technique" (malware) which collected the IP of visitors. See pages 31-33 of the PDF Three questions:
If it's possible for the owner of a hidden service (whether the FBI or a regular person) to install malware which grabs visitors' IPs, then what is stopping any hidden service owner from doing this?
The Wired article states that "In a two-week period, the FBI collected IP addresses, hardware MAC addresses (a unique hardware identifier for the computer?s network or Wi-Fi card) and Windows hostnames on at least 25 visitors to the sites. Subpoenas to ISPs produced home addresses and subscriber names, and in April 2013, five months after the NIT deployment, the bureau staged coordinated raids around the country."
However, in the affidavit, I'm not sure that MAC addresses are Considering the number of individuals that must have visited the hidden service, this doesn't seem to be very many people. Why were so few identified? Were the 25 using outdated browsers (TBB)?
How, in this case, was it possible for the FBI to learn the IP addresses of visitors to this hidden service? The Tor hidden server page states that "In general, the complete connection between client and hidden service consists of 6 relays: 3 of them were picked by the client with the third being the rendezvous point and the other 3 were picked by the hidden service."
Can someone knowledgeable please explain how visitors to a Tor hidden service can have their real IPs detected?

Thanks for these links. Illuminating reading.
However, the story I referred to has nothing to do with Freedom Hosting.
It refers to "Operation Torpedo" (get the joke: "tor" + "pedo").
Wired did a follow up to the original story on 26 August: Original story (5 August): As I mentioned, the original story has a link to the affidavit which contains information about the FBI malware.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor -> VPN Clarification 
My two cents.
I use a VPN then Tor. If I'm not wrong, my ISP sees that I've connected to the VPN IP. The Tor entry node sees that I've arrived from the VPN This is beneficial if you don't want your ISP to know that you are a Tor user. I suspect that a VPN is less "suspicious" than Tor.
You can buy the VPN service with Bitcoin for added anonymity. Also, check to see whether the VPN leaks your DNS at  or equivalent.
I have checked in Wireshark what happens when I use a VPN and Tor.
The tun0 (the VPN using OpenVPN) interface shows my VPN IP contacting the Tor entry node. I check this using It is of note that tun0 will also show traffic from the VPN IP to other non-Tor IPs. You can look up what these IPs are in WHOIS. I guess this is just other traffic from me (via my VPN IP) to the internet.
The wlan0 shows my internal IP (192.168.x.x) to the VPN IP.
I know this thread closed about a week ago but if anyone has any comments on my post then please reply.

Thanks for the advice. I understand what you are saying. My point is that, to me at this moment, setting up a hidden service on my VPS sounds somewhat intimidating. I realise that to you and most technical people on this list, it's something trivial. I am not a "naturally" technical person (if we can divide people up into technical and non-technical segments). Hence, to you and your ilk, what is normal and easy, appears complicated and demanding to people like me.
At the same time, perhaps I'm wrong and it's easy to set-up a hidden server to look for SSH connections? Perhaps I'm assuming that things are harder than they are in order to persuade myself not to learn. I'm also "time poor" at the moment which doesn't help!

@_subject: [tor-talk] =?utf-8?q?Are_webmail_providers_biased_against_Tor=3F?= 
I have noticed that when I try to login to my Gmail or Hotmail accounts with Tor, I invariably get asked to validate myself (e.g. receive an SMS). This is understandably due my IP being in a different country from the "usual" IPs that I use to sign in.
However, I have experimented with StrictExitNodes. I am in New York and have used a number of New York exit nodes. I still get asked to verify.
I am wondering if Tor developers or experienced users know (for a fact) whether or not this is "normal" or whether using an exit node automatically makes Gmail and Hotmail think that a "hacker" is attempting to access the accounts.
This is not a case of a website e.g. Craigslist blocking Tor. It is whether the use of an exit node IP automatically engenders scrutiny from whatever security algorithms certain webmail providers use.

The impression seems to be that Tor is ipso facto suspicious to Gmail irrespective of the exit node's location, whereas "abnormal" IPs (e.g. those from Nepal) are only suspicious if they originate from outside the usual geographical location of the user.

Thank you for this information. The other issue is whether the fingerprint of the TBB raises suspicions. The website  shows:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0
I don't know if this is a common (non-TBB) string. Could this also cause Gmail's algorithms to request validation?
In terms of IP addresses, I would expect Gmail to object if a New Zealand user started to login from Nepal. My issue is whether Gmail should object if a New Zealand user (based in Auckland) logged in with a VPN or tor exit node based in Auckland.

In the Preferences section of the TBB, the proxy is SOCKS 5 on Since the TBB is a web browser and the web uses HTTP(S), why is the HTTP settings not used.
I understand that Tor also uses SOCKS (e.g. torsocks). But, even so, the browser uses HTTP(S). Why does the browser require SOCKS and not HTTP?
I know there is a very simple answer but I don't know what it is!

Just to check: I am using TBB and I download a file (PDF, EXE, whatever) and the box comes up which says "Tor Browser cannot display this file. You will need to open it with another application", presumably if I click "OK" then the download happens via the Tor network.
In other words: the download cannot happen outside of the Tor network.
(I realise that if one opens a document while running Tor the images or macros in the PDF or DOC file can provide one's "real" IP to a server but that's not what I'm talking about here).

@_subject: [tor-talk] =?utf-8?q?Am_I_successfully_using_Torsocks=2C_SSH=2C_a?= 
I, like many other uses of Tor, have become increasingly frustrated with sites like Craigslist which discriminate against Tor. It makes these sites hard to use. I therefore decided to discover if it is possible to use Tor but end up with a non-Tor IP.
I use Torsocks to login to a VPS server via SSH and bind SSH to a specific port with SSH’s -D option.
My configuration is: torsocks ssh -D 33333 name at vps.com (33333 is just a random unused port).
My normal Firefox browser (not the Tor Browser Bundle) has in Preferences / Advanced / Connection the SOCKS host set to 127.0.0.1, the port set to 33333, SOCKS v5 is ticked, and remote DNS is ticked. The “No proxy for” box is blank.
I also use a VPN for added privacy to ensure that my ISP cannot tell that I am connecting to Tor. The result is (in my opinion):
VPN ---> Torsocks (on 127.0.0.1) ---> SSH (bound to port 33333) ---> VPS ---> Internet.
First, I connect to my VPN provider. Second, I connect to port 33333 on 127.0.0.1 where Tor (via Torsocks) and SSH is running. Third, I connect to a VPS (over SSH) and SSH is bound to port 33333. Torsocks transmits the HTTP(S) traffic through three Tor nodes. Finally, the Tor routing ends at the VPS and the traffic goes out onto the internet from the infrastructure of the VPS.
In my browser, I checked  which shows the IP address of the VPS. When I SSH into the VPS, I see that the last IP that logged in is that of a Tor exit node. In Wireshark, I see that my VPN interface connects to the IP address of a Tor entry node.
I have two questions. Does this setup appear sensible and secure? I am sure there are other ways to achieve the same goal but I would like to know my system is valid. I think my system is secure but I would appreciate opinions from more experienced users.
The result of this model is that my IP is that of the VPS which is static. I did add a HTTP proxy to Preferences / Advanced / Connection in Firefox but the result was that the SOCKS proxy (and thus Torsocks and SSH) were ignored so the result was VPN –-> HTTP proxy –-> Internet (which bypasses Tor). Is it possible to use a HTTP(S) (or another type) of proxy to alter the IP. The ideal model would be: VPN –-> Torsocks (on 127.0.0.1) –-> SSH (bound to port 33333) –-> VPS –-> Proxy (e.g. HTTP(S)) –-> Internet.
Thank you for your help. I appreciate any advice and suggestions.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and Spamhaus. 
I was looking at exit nodes on  which checks dozens of blacklists. Typically, each exit node is considered bad by about five blacklists. I've checked about 15 exit nodes and all are blacklisted by xbl.spamhaus.org and, by extension, zen.spamhaus.org (zen is a compendium of all Spamhaus' blacklists; if an IP is in one then it's in zen).
Virtually all are in cbl.abuseat.org which is the Composite Blacklist which is a part of Spamhaus.
Yet most blacklisting services do not consider exit nodes to be dubious.

For example, if I go to Craigslist and can't use the website  and get "This IP has been automatically blocked" or when I login to Gmail I am forced to verify myself, is this related to Spamhaus' blacklisting?

I think not because, from the email headers I have seen, the exit node IP is never included in the message headers at the destination.
The IP of the sender is that of the webmail provider not the exit node. So it should not matter because, even if the exit node IP is "bad", it is never seen by the recipient.

AUIU, my VPS sees the tor exit node IP but the destination site sees the VPS IP in Country X.
Does this sound viable? Is there an easier way than ssh? If this idea is sensible, then the command line means I have to use a very basic browser like Lynx. Correct?
All ideas / opinions / criticisms / suggestions welcomed.

The reason, simply, is that I have never used the -D of ssh before!
So am I running torsocks ssh to the VPS and then ssh -D to 8080 at the same time?
Why would the local SOCKS run on 8080? Tor runs, I think, on 9150?
I'm sure you're right but could you please spell it out for me. Thanks!

I signed up for Proton Mail only to be asked for SMS validation (just as Gmail does). Tutanota did not ask for SMS checks, but my account has been suspended for up to 48 hours while they manually check it (which doesn't sound too unreasonable since it's free). However, both these services proclaim they are pro-privacy but they are more or less

How do you mean "nuked"? Existing accounts just vanish? Or you are never allowed to send / receive mail?
Openmailbox (which I am using now) used to allow signups via Tor but now any form of Tor or VPN signup is banned.

Ruggedinbox is unreliable as the site is often down. VFEmail used to work but I can't seem to sign-up now.
ProtonMail demands SMS validation.
Tutanota seems OK but on this list a poster said that they closed his accounts down for no reason.

Earlier this week I attempted to buy a domain with Namecheap since they accept bitcoin and, helpfully, have WHOISguard free for the first year.
Sadly Namecheap do not like proxies which includes Tor and will prevent you from purchasing.
Can anyone suggest a reputable (i.e. one that works) domain registrar that accepts bitcoin and has no problem with Tor. I say "reputable" because, in the past, I've found that a number of Tor and bitcoin friendly registrars have a tendency to time out or hang for some reason mid-way through the registration process.
Many thanks.

I didn't explain myself very well. With the proxychains tool ( you can write something like:
proxychains firefox And then in /etc/proxychains.conf:
socks5 127.0.0.1 9050
socks5 100.101.102.103 33333
Proxychains runs Tor then the SOCKS proxy so the destination website sees a SOCKS IP not a Tor exit node IP. Yet the user is still using Tor to access the SOCKS proxy.
The problem is that the SOCKS IP itself may be "bad" (perhaps even as "bad" as an exit node IP) and hence Gmail, FB, etc, still discriminate (and hence demand additional proof).
Since SOCKS IPs, like exit node IPs, can be selected by country and (sometimes) via city, it's possible to have an IP which is in the city in which the webmail or social network person resides.
IOW: a London-based FB user can have his FB account accessed by a London-based SOCKS IP (accessed over Tor). Whether or not the FB login algorithm would regard this geographically correct but nonetheless SOCKS-based IP as authentic is not something I would know. You mentioned in the video that the "problem" with Tor is that the user's IP changes and the IP that attempts to login might be in a different continent from that which is usual. In this situation, you have a non-Tor IP which is geographically correct attempt to login. Yet it is still a proxy IP not a home user or business IP. Is that an issue for Gmail, Yahoo!, FB, etc? I don't know.

But a point might be: tor exit nodes are public but SOCKS proxies are not. Unless you tell me otherwise, I don't think there are centralized databases of SOCKS proxies.
Now my suspicion is that you will say: not the point. People will be messing around with said SOCKS proxies (the aforementioned scraping for example) and hence it's irrelevant whether there's an accessible record that said IP is a SOCKS proxy. Yes?
Just one more point: one can use  to check whether an IP is on any blacklists. I've occasionally found proxies that are 100% clean. Yet still I get asked for a CAPTCHA when using them. This is, I suspect, because  focuses on blacklists used for spam (e.g. those checked by mail servers) rather than looking at any kind of web-based "badness" e.g. scraping. Hence an IP that may have a perfect mail spam score (no blacklists) doesn't preclude said IP having a high level of badness for non-mail spam You mean Venus in Furs versus the 120 Days of Sodom? :-)

Spell out to me, please, why it is important (you mention it twice) that the IPs of exit nodes and VPNs belong to data centers. I assume it's because they are static IPs (in contrast to residential IPs which are less static)?

How does Tor deal with IPv6? I ask because I recently signed up with a VPS which automatically allocates both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. I checked my IP with a variety of online IP checkers and noticed that one checker -  - showed my IPv6 address rather than my IPv4 address.
How would IPv6 work with Tor?

Hi Alec,
Thanks for your detailed and informative response. I had never heard of "scraping". BTW: are you the Alec Muffett name-checked in Kevin Mitnick's autobiography? I assume so.
It may be of note that when I got the Google error, Amazon also required a CAPTCHA in order for me to login to my account. Whomever was using the exit node maliciously, was obviously affecting non-Google organizations Since you used to work at Facebook (and I know you've posted on this list before about the FB onion address), I've a couple of questions based on my experiences with FB and Tor.
I'm wondering if FB (and, for that matter, other companies like Google) have some kind of hierarchy of "badness" of IP addresses. For example, for FB is an exit node "worse" than a SOCKS proxy which is "worse" than a VPN? I ask because I usually login to my FB via a London-based IP provided by my ISP. However, when I try to login to my FB account via an exit node with a London IP or via a SOCKS proxy with a London IP, I am asked to verify myself by selecting photos of my friends. I could well understand this if I was logging in from an IP - any type of IP - in, say, France but I don't really understand why a London-based IP should be suspicious since it matches the usual geographical login location, unless of course, all exit nodes and known SOCKS proxies are suspicious to FB irrespective of whether or not they correlate with the "normal" IP location of the user (in my case London).
What I am trying to ask is: how does FB (or similar organisations) decide that an IP is "bad" when it is in the same place as the IP that normally logs in to an account.
I wonder if you have any thoughts on the matter. Thanks!

This is exactly my issue. If I login to my Gmail or FB account then invariably Gmail or FB thinks I am a suspicious person hence "Something seems a bit different about the way you're trying to sign in. Complete the step below to let us know it's you and not someone pretending to be you" or worse "Google couldn't verify it's you, so you can't sign in to this account right now." In the FB case, I am asked to identify my "friends" half of whom have baby photos or the image is unclear.. Sometimes I get them wrong and am locked out for a few hours. And this is when connecting via the FB .onion address.
IMO, and I am curious to know what Alec thinks, Google, FB, etc are creating far too many false positives. Googling "Something seems a bit different about the way you're trying to sign in" results in numerous cases where innocent users have been locked out.
Two questions:
Is there a way that using an exit node for Gmail, FB, etc will not be considered suspicious? Is that even possible?
Is it possible to use a different proxy way to access Gmail, FB, etc without being seen as suspicious? For example, one could use proxychains with Tor followed by a SOCKS proxy to login.
In both cases above (exit node and exit node plus SOCKS) we assume that the IP address more or less matches the "normal" non-proxy login. I am in Paris and use a Paris exit node and a Paris SOCKS proxy for example.
Finally, thanks for participating in this discussion. It is rare to have people who work or used to work at the major webmail and social media companies from a) getting involved and b) providing a nuanced (not anti-Tor) perspective.

Quick Question:
The node JPsi2 has an IP address of 37.200.99.251 and a host name of j60204.servers.jiffybox.net.
Does connecting to this node require DNS resolution? I assume not. I imagine that I request a connection to the IP address (not to the domain name).
