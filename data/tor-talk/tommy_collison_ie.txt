Hi all --
First time posting, so hope this message is on-topic. I wanted to alert
y'all to an encryption workshop/crypto-party happening in Brooklyn on
January 30. Verso Books, who just published Biella Coleman's book on
Anonymous, is hosting it, and I'm helping out teaching.
Am hoping to get participants set up with Tor, OTR and PGP encryption,
and maybe hard-drive encryption. I'll also go over online privacy in
general, threat models and the like.
has more info and an RSVP link.
Best --

Part Wikileaks, part TMZ, Slur.io positions whistleblowing outside of
the public interest. A marketplace where the highest bidder takes all
creates an explicit profit motive.
I really hope it's a joke or something.

(Not an expert.) I thought that HOC was better than most portrayals of
hackers in pop culture (didn't lean on cliches too much, didn't
overstate their 'powers,' for the lack of a better word) but it still
leaned on old memes -- Lucas calls himself "Data_Crusader" going into a
chat room. Sigh.
