@_subject: [tor-talk] sock proxy port 
hi, I think  sock proxy port should be 9050
but with TBB, I notice that the socket port changes every time I started
TBB, like 49223, 58871
what is the reason for this? and is it possible to make it constant?

@_subject: [tor-talk] will html5 ruin the anonymity of Tor or TBB 
We know that flash plugin is third-party stuff and may ruin the anonymity
of Tor,
how about HTML5, will it be a threat for tor or TBB?

@_subject: [tor-talk] exit node cache 
when a Tor client send a http request, requesting a lot of data, like
picture, files or video
the http request will finally be sent by a Tor exit node,
and the coresponding web server will respond to the Tor exit node with http
response carrying the large bulk data.
The bulk data is transmitted via tcp connection between the tor exit node
and the webserver,
so there will be a lot of TCP ACKs.
my understanding is:
Since the Tor exit node may spend a bit more time to send the http data
back to the Tor client,
1) if the Tor exit node is continueing acknowledging the webserver on
receipt of tcp segments,
then the Tor exit node will have to cache a lot data, is it right?
2) actually the TCP ack is from the Tor client? if the Tor exit node
doesn't receive the TCP ack from the Tor client,
it will never acknowledge the receipt of tcp segments from the webserver?
which understanding is right?

@_subject: [tor-talk] where does Tor browser bundle cache the web page content 
if I want to find the cache location for ordinary firefox, for example,
flash vidoes, I can use the following command to find it
find .mozilla/firefox/*.default/Cache -type f -exec file {} \;  | grep Flash
but for TBB, I looked into the TBB folder and couldn't identify the location
indeed, there is a folder called .mozilla, but there is nothing inside
does anyone know where TBB cache its web content?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor web browsing http connection establish procedures 
for web browsing I'm a bit curious about the http connection establishment
 without tor, when we access a website, the procedures are:
           DNS query :                                                C ->
DNS server
           DNS response:                                            DNS
server -> C
           the client initiate a TCP 3-way  handshake:    C<-> Webserver
           HTTP GET:                                                  C->
but with tor, my understanding and questions are:
           DNS query :                    C -> TOR network -> exit node ->
DNS server
           DNS response:                DNS server -> exit node

@_subject: [tor-talk] exit node cache 
yes, that is it. so when the exit node buffer, namely the stream packaging
window, is full
the receive window of the exit node will decrease
