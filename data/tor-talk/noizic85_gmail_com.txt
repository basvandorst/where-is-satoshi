Is it closing in before you update FireFox portable in the tor bundle? I
thought it was possible to do it manually but it seems all kinds of settings
connected to tor requires some advanced computer skills and there aren't any
decent extensive guides out there.

I'm trying to get countermail working with my TOR bundle I use on a USB
stick for added security and anomity when I feel I need it. However, I
believe Java has some security holes that's why it's not accepted. While
that's good I need TOR to accept java so I can access countermail's login
applet and considering their site's security (no IP logging, added
end-to-end encryption, OpenPGP encryption, digital certificates) along with
the fact the added anomity I will receive by using a TOR bundle on my USB
stick with a portable FireFox it should not be that harmful.
Anyone that could help me?

Ah, ok. I will contact them as I've been asking questions and they
respond quickly. Now it's always great with competition and other than
AnonymousSpeech I haven't find any other decent anonymous e-mail
domains. Could you or anyone as well recommend some other that works
well with tor? I like both, I guess AS is preferred via TOR because it
doesn't use Java.

Great, that's actually what I wanted to accomplish when I begin using

Is there something specific I need to do to make Thunderbirds'
connections go through TOR?

I forgot to ask. How do I actually check if Thunderbird is going through
