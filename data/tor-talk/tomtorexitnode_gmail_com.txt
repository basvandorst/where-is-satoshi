I just put a Tor exitnode online with the nickname "ididitfortehlulz".  I decided to be an exit node.
Have fun with it ;)

@_subject: Question about serving directory information 
Hash: SHA1
Hello fellow Tor-users :),
I'm trying to run a Tor node that will only serve Directory information.
My hoster doesn't allow me to run a Tor relay, but I want to let him
donate his bandwidth to the Tor project by serving Directory
information. But when I turn off the ORPort, Tor doesn't publish his
Is there a way to let Tor listen on his DirPort and let Tor serve
Directory data on this port but not do any relaying of other traffic
through it?
Thanks in advance,

Hash: SHA1
Hello fellow Tor relay admins,
I run several Tor relays on residential DSL connections. This morning my
dad called me, telling me that my ISP had disconnected us from the
Internet because of a Trojan running on my systems (I wasn't at home at
that moment ;)). They had received a abuse complainant that one of my
boxes on this DSL connection was on a botnet.
I checked the timestamp of the log they sended to me with the uptime of
the computers. Only the computer that was running a Tor node was online.
It was pretty obvious that the botnet connections were coming from this
box. The box was clean, had no rootkits installed or other malicious
software, so it was Tor, relaying a connection for a bot.
My ISP didn't knew what Tor was and asked if "that Tor" logged the
connections that were running through it. I told them Tor was an
anonymity system so it doesn't keep any logs of the traffic that's going
through it. They were confused, they told me that every decent Tor relay
keeps a log of the connections running through it.
I'm living in The Netherlands, running this Tor node on the ISP XS4ALL.
XS4ALL is one of the ISP's with the most knowledge of the internet and
the things happening on the internet. I'm pretty shocked that they
didn't knew about Tor. I want to alert all the Tor relay admins that are
running Tor nodes on a connection from XS4ALL to be prepared to get
disconnected, because they think there is a trojan or rootkit running on
your system..
XS4ALL restored the DSL line but I had to promise that it wouldn't
happen again..

Thanks :) My ISP reconnected me again but I had to promise to never run
Tor again. Tomorrow I'm going to call them and try to change their
minds. XS4ALL is a ISP who stands for freedom of speech, they are
against censorship, etc etc. If they knew what Tor was they wouldn't
disconnect me for running Tor..

I chose to be an exit node because I wanted to donate my bandwidth to
other Tor users. I've been running a middle-node for several years but I
think that good end nodes are needed too, so I decided to start running
an end node.

This morning is a friend of mine also was disconnected from the internet
because XS4ALL thinks there is a Trojan running on his system. He also
runs Tor on his system.. I'll keep you guys posted.

You are totally right. The strangest thing is that XS4ALL is a ISP that
stands for freedom of speech, anti-censorship, protection of the privacy
of their customers, etc. And they don't know Tor. I thought XS4ALL was
one of the best ISP's in The Netherlands to run a Tor node, but that
assumption was totally wrong..
Because this is the second line closed down @ XS4ALL all my Tor nodes
are offline now.. Don't want to take the risk to get disconnected again..

Yep, I'm going to run a non-exit node too.. But I really want to run an
exit node and I really don't like it that XS4ALL is filtering me because
of that..

Tor will detect it and republish his server descriptor with the new IP  in it.

This message started flooding my logs: Jan 09 22:19:27.260 [notice]  We're missing a certificate from authority tor26 with signing key  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000: launching request.
A friend of my has exact the same message flooding over his log. We  are both running 0.2.0.15-alpha. OS on my box is FreeBSD and on his  box Debian, so I think this message is not OS related but it's related  to the authority. Is someone else having the same message lately?
