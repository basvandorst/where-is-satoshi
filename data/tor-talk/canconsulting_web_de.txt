@_subject: Key length and PK algorithm of TOR 
two questions.
1) is there a specific reason why TOR does use RSA with
a keylength of only 1024 Bit?
2) is there a specific reason why TOR does not use ECC,
which is more secure (with reasonable curve parameters and same
key length like RSA) *and* uses less or, depending on the
ECC algorithm, at least not significantly more CPU cycles than RSA?
