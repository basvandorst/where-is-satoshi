We seek volunteers to run tor gateway software on stable IPs with good
The political and legal risks are probably small compared to that of a
full exit server. The bandwidth
requirements are smaller too, but we ask that all nodes have at least
1mbps up/down to aid responsiveness.
WikiLeaks.org is a wikimedia project for the large scale dispersal of
leaked documents.
 Thanks,

This is a distributed squid pre caching system with various dns and
ssl hacks that we have developed for WikiLeaks.org to increase the
accessibility, performance and security of possibly very popular
hidden servers.

@_subject: Is tor the right choice? 
We use something similar to freenet for the file store. Tor is only
one actor in the play. We've put a lot of thought into it how to make
it scalable and accessible and secure.

Does the public nature of tor routers makes hidden services  vulnerable to
discovery using flooding attacks?
Open an onion connection to the hidden service, asking for echos. Now  flood each
router. If the "ping" is overly delayed, the router is on the hidden  Since the rendezvous node is known and the other nodes vary over  time, this will
eventually reveal the entry node.

Yes, this is what we observed too; but found nothing about this in  the FAQ
on hidden services and the default tor config is not set up to permit  this configuration without
Likewise [not in reference to hidden servers], it is better for Tor  to use a different outbound
address to inbound, since the ORport addresses are published globally  by Dirservers. Also
not mentioned to my knowledge.

Then it seems a further recommendation for hidden server operations is
to manually specify guard nodes from a set of high traffic nodes.
