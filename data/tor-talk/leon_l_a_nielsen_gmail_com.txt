Use the middle proxy started by tor.
I can't write Ruby, but I guess there is a built-in method to go
through a proxy before connecting to a website.
The proxy will send you inside tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How close to really secure Android phone with Tor 
Just remember rooting/updating to custom firmware might open up for
some new holes.
I recently set up a fake wifi hotstop and logged all traffic over port
80, and apparently, my turned off phone connected and started asking
for a file from a modding site (something like stats.js) every 10
second or so.
Also, you might have heard that next (google) version of android is
going to have SELinux :)
Just to point out, you can't be sure that your android is always as
reliable as one might think.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Phones for Tor 
I had a weird experience with a android ROM which even when turned off send
stats to a server over wifi... I have not tested it with stock rom, and I
have no idea how it works, but it might be worth listening to phone data
and try to figure out what it does before using a mod\ded phone for
something important... Even when it\s turned off.
