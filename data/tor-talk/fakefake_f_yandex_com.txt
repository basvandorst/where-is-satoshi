yes there is. but that doesnt work. neither in tor browser nor in normal firefox. if private browsing is enabled you can also in normal firefox not enable saving passwords.

NSA, Tempora, PRISM And Company can always look who is behind Tor?
They know the real IP of every Tor user every time they use Tor?
What about all those people recently suggesting Tor to defeat those? A whole website prism-break.org!
Shouldn't Torproject be more clear about it's limitations? This is not even in FAQ!
