@_subject: [tor-talk] Banned from IRC. Is there a work-around? 
Generally speaking most IRC networks block tor nodes (the only execption I
can think of is freenode, but even then you have to email them with a PGP
key etc). The easyist work around i've found is to use one of those "online
webchat" irc things (CGI:IRC, or whatever they are called), those don't
normally block tor nodes, and aren't normally blocked on irc networks. It's
not suitable for long term useage, but it does work.
