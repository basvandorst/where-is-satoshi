@_subject: [tor-talk] Can it be used on a android phone. 
Orweb uses the built in webview feature of android, which can't use
remote dns resolving (required for .onion) and is not secure and
fails to protect your IP with html5 videos e.g.
Use Orfox instead, it's a Firefox fork with full socks5 support, so
.onion sites should work too.
