@_subject: [tor-talk] Metrics in Iran and other countries 
Hi all,
1. I was wondering why there is such a huge drop in Direct TOR Traffic?
2. Does a country/government with only a small number of directly
connecting users pose a threat to the people using it in those countries?
3. Where is the most reliable source to find out how secure and trusted
the TOR Network is?
i.e. whether then network or browser has any known vulnerabilities.
4. Is TOR safe to use on it's own, do we need to use other tools along
with it?
Users from Australia directly connecting to the TOR Network appears on
the steady decline, at least according to the metrics data.
Does this mean TOR Users in Australia will be under more scrutiny and
Here is the metrics on users directly connecting to TOR from Iran.
Since January it has fluctuated significantly.
5. Can I still recommend TOR for people in Iran, or would that be
dangerous and irresponsible?
6. Is there a visual display of the TOR Network as overall? (similar
visuals to what vidalia use to provide)
Thank you for your replies :)
If you wish to reply to me directly PLEASE ENCRYPT your messages.
Kind Regards,

I have noticed though that at least on the Mac version of Tor that after
the update "6.5.2" the tor browser window is very laggy and I don't mean
the page loading, I mean the system responsiveness and the rainbow spiral.
I know it is not my Machine because it passed a clean bill of health
after thorough diagnostics.
My machine handles everything else alright, just not Tor after the last
Please let me know if any other mac users are experiencing these issues
since the update.
Kind Regards,

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Router 
Hi Tor Community,
I remember some time last year there was talk about a router for
journalists to bring with them when they went abroad.
It was really simple. I don't remember what it was called, netaid netkit???
Does anyone here know? Whats the progress of that project?
Is it safe to use? Also where can I find it online?
Kind Regards,
