@_subject: [tor-talk] TorTV - just the WDTV for now... 
re all,
Some weeks ago I was visiting Naif in Milano and saw he also had a
WDTV so we ended up talking about it, since I'm also a WDLXTV app dev
he encouraged me to make something like this now. So here we are.
I've built and packaged Tor to run on WDTV devices, which are pretty
popular Internet TV solid state appliances found on the consumer
market for less than 100$ - also many art musea use them in storage
and use them often for exhibitions ...
This project is called TorTV WDTV is a decent MIPS box with an amazing community behind it,
especially thanks to B-Rad's WDLXTV firmware I'm looking for more TV appliances to hack and curious which platforms
you know of, here I've also submitted a post on Slashdot asking people
about it, since I know well only the WDTV, I'd rather invest time into
devices known to run well cross-platform apps and having an easy way
to deploy them
At last, I used to run a pretty fast Tor server in Europe back in 2006
its handle was Streamtime, for a project focusing on Iraqi bloggers
 until it was taken down for a bust on pedofilia,
the project itself was way more active back then. So here I'm back
with a more resilient approach, consider it another humble
contribution to Tor which I'm well intentioned to maintain :^)
hack on!

re all,
cheers Phil, thanks for the cozy welcome :^)
brief updates:
- We made it for a discussion on slashdot, there are some interesting
  bits of knowledge coming out of it
  - Yes I'm interested in working together so that TorTV becomes an
  official Tor application. Let me know how!
- Does anyone knew about this use of Tor? how do you feel about it?
    I for one didn't thought of having streaming video over Tor, I'm
  more thinking of a compact, cheap and solid-state portable proxy
  disguised as TV device, eventually torify some connections of the TV
  itself at a later stage.

re all,
what is the difference between DNSCrypt and a simple compination of
ssh and socat? something like:
 Iclient$ ssh -L 5353:127.0.0.1:5353 server
 Iserver$ socat tcp4-listen:5353,reuseaddr,fork UDP:dns.server:53
 Iclient# socat -T15 udp4-recvfrom:53,reuseaddr,fork tcp:127.0.0.1:5353
 Iclient# echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolv.conf
works well to encrypt DNS queries to a dns server of choice.

AFAIK msmtp devs prefer to add features with shell scripts and piping,

@_subject: [tor-talk] Stories of pwnage 
Apologies for cross-posting, however this list might be directly
interested in this story since the hackers who break in our servers
made extensive use of Tor.
re all,
as some might have noticed or read, Dyne.org has been hacked and
lulled a few weeks ago by the crewz at Everyone Gets Owned
(beware the above is better read while playing your fav tunes of
 Autechre, Clock DVA, Ozric Tentacles, Chemical Broz or even NIN)
In the E.G.O. release there is an interesting range of informations
about the happy mess running in one of our public servers: you can
even use some of it to figure out some passwords and stuff. Damn.
While the l33t sp33ch in the zine sounds quite l4m3 (c'mon guys, its
2013, and happy new year!) the reader should be careful before judging
this as a scriptkid gig, because to our analysis it seems to be an
interesting hack. EGO crewz have used a 0-day vulnerability in the
wiki Moin Moin to gain shell access as www-data, something that
affected at that time a lot of more websites like the Debian wiki or
the Python wiki. Here are the details as released by the Moin Moin
crews: As of now this is a rather serious vuln, patches are almost all out,
everyone should update. Our reaction to the discovery was simply to
inform Debian and MoinMoin privately, nothing else. We were anyway
honoured to see a 0-day burned like that on us. Wow :^)
The tech they used to gain the shell is quite serious, there is some
smart tunneling via Tor involved and cute moinexec.py shell, in
general a rather neat way to cut through our butter with a style that
looks better in code than in their z1n3 l33t sp33ch.
And they were also right in guessing that almost noone used Jaro Mail.
Ultimately the E.G.O. hackers have been kind on us and have not
bothered to damage or deface anything. Some people reported outage of
the dyne:bolic webpage on reddit
but that was pure coincidence since the dynebolic.org website is
hosted on another machine that had an harddisk failure right during
those days.
In their release they speak about having rooted kernel, vendor and
bugged our software with backdoors, but frankly that's not true. We
have crypto hashes and signatures of all the software we distribute
and controlling those everything matches. The server "Munir" which was
hacked had a lax security policy anyway because nothing really
critical was in there.... it also seems that E.G.O. crews haven't
bothered to do root escalation either, but then we might be just wrong
on that :^) and while our software users will still be safe, we'll
leave those hackers keep a shell on our server, why not. After all,
they seem to be able to get one anyway if they want.
In fact, just in case they like to step forward with us privately, we
are keen to have some exchange and even include part of their
interested members in our network (yes, we do have some private
mailinglists, you might have seen then by now).
At last, since as we mentioned the hack was done with proper tools and
as of now a 0-day was burned for the lulz, we offer a reward of
10.1337 Bitcoins to the E.G.O. hackers for releasing some of their
neat tools as free software, like the stuff they have used with
us... if you do, just publish a Bitcoin address on the next zine,
we'll pimp it up for your next golden teeth implant.
that's almost all folks! now lets talk politics :^) we leave you with
two quotes, the last one is a rather long text from the 5th issue of
the Zero For Owned zine titled "Summer of Ham" where some known
r0ckst4rs were hacked. Immediately below another short quote. All this
because we agree with the rant of the often marginalized, so called
"black hats": there are serious problems in the security industry,
that the hacker community at large should address, maybe is the time
to bash the hell out of the manager cast and their fck'd up hierarchy.
As Michael Abrash once wrote, quoting his colleague Gabe Newell:
 When he (Gabe Newell) looked into the history of the organization, he
 found that hierarchical management had been invented for military
 purposes, where it was perfectly suited to getting 1,000 men to march
 over a hill to get shot at. When the Industrial Revolution came
 along, hierarchical management was again a good fit, since the
 objective was to treat each person as a component, doing exactly the
 same thing over and over. [...]  Hierarchical management ...
 bottlenecks innovation through the people at the top of the
 hierarchy, and there's no reason to expect that those people would be
 particularly creative about coming up with new products that are
 dramatically different from existing ones - quite the opposite, in
 fact.

The security scene  is fucked. You have Dan  Kaminsky lecturing you on
how DNS poisoning  will destroy life as we know  it. You have Matasano
harvesting talent  and critiquing everyone,  and then Ptacek  can only
announce  the release  of....a graphical  firewall  management client.
There's kingcope  killing bugs and dropping  weaponized exploits while
making no  other contribution  except putting a  smile on the  face of
kiddies. There's  iDefense and their competitors  selling exploits and
only doing  research in how to  make more exploits.  There's Jeff Moss
running a  conference under the hideous  misnomer "Blackhat Briefings"
where the same researchers search  for glory and present the same shit
year after year. There are people who just live press release by press
release. And on top  of it all, somehow you STILL have  not got rid of
Kevin Mitnick.  The industry cares  about virtualization one  year and
iPhones the  next, every  year forgetting the  lessons it  should have
picked up in the last.
If you are just someone looking to  pay a fair price to not get owned,
you find  out quickly  that none  of these people  exist to  help you.
Very few people in this  industry have their income model based around
actually making you  more secure. At best, some of  them have it based
around convincing you that you are better off.
The  very concept  of "penetration  testing" is  fundamentally flawed.
The problem with  it is that the penetration tester  has a limited set
of targets they're allowed to attack, while a real attacker can attack
anything in order to  gain access to the site/box.  So if  a site on a
shared host is  being tested, just because site1.com  is "secure" that
does NOT in  anyway mean that the server  is secure, because site2.com
could easily be  vulnerable to all sorts of  simple attacks.  The time
constraint is another problem. A professional pentester with a week or
two to spend on a client's network may or may not get into everything.
A real  dedicated hacker making the  slog who spends a  month of eight
hour days WILL get into anything  they target. You're lucky if it even
takes him that long, really.
Those things should all be  very obvious, but whitehats still make the
mistake of discounting them. Look at Mitnick. Every time he gets owned
he blames his host or his  DNS provider. If he's getting owned through
them, that's still his fault.  Choosing a host is a security decision,
it's  just like  choosing a  password. If  you choose  a weak  one you
expose yourself.  It's still your fault.
It's   the   same   with   outsourcing   the   development   of   your
security-critical code.  Mitnick could get  someone else to make him a
flashy website,  and then blame them  when it is full  of file include
vulnerabilities.  People do this  all the  time, indirectly,  by using
ridiculous  CMS  or  blog  software.  As  an  easy  example,  look  at
Wordpress.  Even easier,  look  at Wordpress  in  2007.  Horrid.  When
considering Wordpress, a blackhat starts reading the PHP, shudders and
giggles, and then laughs at the idea  of ever using it on one of their
servers. A whitehat never gets  that far apparently, they just install
it  and  get  owned.  I  simply  fail  to  see  how  leading  security
researchers run  all kinds  of code that  is blatantly  dangerous. Are
they really that bad at reading code? Or do they just not care much if
their passwords end up on  Full Disclosure? If it's the second option,
why is that?  Why can these people make a living selling security when
they make such bad choices? How do they maintain legitimacy? They take
less responsibility for getting owned than do the people who they sell
services to.
There's a popular term for people who don't read code.
We call them script kiddies.
You cannot outsource  blame. You HAVE to take  responsibility for your
mistakes, whether they are mistakes in your code, mistakes in code you
are using, mistakes by your host,  or mistakes in who you trust. These
are all  security choices.  Learn to control  this shit. Learn  how to
read code.  A lot of the  time it only  takes a very shallow  audit to
realise that the code is crap and  is bound to have bugs. In a smarter
world,  security professionals get  paid to  stop people  from getting
owned. End of. These is no limit to the scope of an audit.
Are you professional  types really this out of touch?  I see all these
papers about how to protect yourself from these super-fucking-advanced
techniques and exploits that very few people can actually develop, and
most hackers will NEVER USE. It's the simple stuff that works now, and
will continue to work years into the future. Not only is it way easier
to dev for  simple mistakes, but they are easier to  find and are more
The  whole concept  of full-disclosure  has backfired.  It  will never
work. It's some slashdot hippie pipe dream. Even you dumbass corporate
types should recognize this. If  you're constantly giving away all the
vulnerabilites you  find, for *FREE*  mind you (and what  other industry
does that?), and the vulnerabilites  get harder and harder to find and
exploit, it will  get harder and harder for you all  to do your "job".
Frankly, I'm  surprised that the non-disclosure  movement didn't start
in  the security industry  in the  first place.  In a  way it  did, by
default.   With full-disclosure,  the security  industry is  all about
show and  gloat, it is not about  fixing anything. A lot  of bugs have
been fixed  from it, but it comes  with the price of  an industry that
likes to cripple itself. Projects  run by teams of trained monkeys are
always eager to add more bugs to replace those that have been fixed.
We hate  the industry because  it is full  of shit. There are  so many
trolls like Kaminsky who just  desperately search for anything new, to
get  attention.   So  many  talentless  buffoons trying  to  scam  the
planet.  A   lot  of   the  actual  talent   out  there   is  severely
misapplied. It's  an industry  tied to news  and not  results, because
very few  of you can  even attain results.  When you can't,  who's the
wiser? Your  customers can  hardly tell if  you have really  made them
more  secure  or  not.   Sometimes  there  are  superficial  benefits,
sometimes there aren't. How do you convince the customer that they are
more ZF0-safe than  before, if they were never  targetted and probably
never will  be? And you all lack  the legitimacy to really  do the job
you should anyways. We can only expose so many frauds, the rest of you
can pretend you have changed something.
Very few whitehats  actually go out there and  provide a service where
they make people more  secure. Not just for a day or  a month. Are you
genuinely fixing  the underlying design and logic  flaws that generate
security problems for your clients or customers? If you actually clean
up every exposed security flaw  they have, will they still be "secure"
in six months or a year?
We could go on. Just in general, the industry is failing.
Flat out failing.
You cannot even protect yourselves.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Dowse: a transparent proxy setup supporting Tor 
re all,
Last night I've released this little handy software called Dowse, which
might interest people on this list.
Here is the homepage of the project: It consolidates what has been my home setup for years now into an easy
to deploy script, tested on both Debian 6 and 7, but should run on any
GNU/Linux box really.
Originally inspired by a post on  which
illustrates how to speed up Privoxy by putting a Squid in front of it,
Dowse helps users with light sysadmin skills to setup such a transparent
proxy at home to filter all traffic on the port 80 (HTTP).
The result is a DHCP and local DNS (implemented with dnsmasq) that can
run such services instead of the ADSL router (which we know nowadays
more than ever it can have backdoors... aehm) and filters out all ads
and a good deal of privacy-eroding web junk for all people connected
through its LAN, without the need to install anything on their
computers, which in fact can run whatever operating system they have.
What it does also - which might interest you in particular - is detect
all URLs whose domain ends in .onion, routing them directly to Tor,
effectively making the onion network accessible without any plugin or
software installed. We know this is not optimal for browsing the onion
in total privacy, yet is a perfect way to let social spaces have a
window on that world that people can use to peek in and make an idea.
Here is the announcement: Here is the GitHub repo: Feedback is very welcome, this is an early public release and can well
use some testing and auditing. I'm planning some more features soon, but
holding my horses just for the moment... among them is dnscrypt
integration, parallel execution of multiple privoxy+tor pipelines to
speed up browsing via squid's round-robin, chroot binary distribution
and testing on OpenWRT and RPi.
I'm interested in reading your opinion on all this,
best wishes for the 2014 and many thanks for keeping up Tor

I don't understand what do you mean by "firewall"?
many things can be done between the network layer 2 and 4 using
ebtables, iptables and transparent proxys. Do you simply want to block
all outgoing traffic if not through Tor?
If you detail your situation then I might be able to include your needs
in this new minimalistic software bundle I'm currently working on
For now, its main focus is to perform well on old PCs or embedded
devices running Linux, with some mild privacy measures (privoxy) and
automatic .onion and .i2p resolution (which is not fully anonymous, but
prone to leaking links to clearnet). I'm contemplating already the
inclusion of a simple switch to make it block all traffic to clearnet.

Well put. I just like to add that Tor Inc should not ignore this
request, not because it having any legal binding of sorts, but simply
because it comes from someone who is most active in the Tor community
(with most useful post on this list, according to my analysis) and
well representative of it. So to say, this can't be called trolling.
And I'm quite confident Tor Inc can provide appropriate information.
I do suspect this request comes in the context of realising what sort
of communication can be established between the community and Tor Inc,
considering its director of communications has posted only twice and
only recently on this list.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Project Corporate Document FOI Request 
I am confused. Our Streamtime.org collective considers itself part of
the Tor community. We ran the 2nd fastest server in Europe until 2006,
when our operations were heavily targeted by Dutch police, so we
desisted running it on our only server, noticing the take-up by then
was considerable so this wouldn't have affected the network. Since
then, nor me nor my colleagues never stopped advocating for Tor in the
context of freedom of speech for people caught in war zones.
In all this time, we have never had an "umbrella" above our heads. In
fact, this would have been pretty embarassing, since the fact that our
operations are *independently motivated* is crucial to our mission and
the nature of the Streamtime project. Or is that why our project has
been somehow overlooked by Tor? many people I've met later on don't
know this story. However, I'm not here for lamenting that.
Just saying we don't have that umbrella, whatever that means.
I'd be curious to know actually.
What you wrote above is very reasonable.  I must admit being foreign
to US legal terms not having grasped this nuance at all in my previous
reply. Thanks for clarifying.
I am still puzzled by the definition of community and even more now
reading yesterday's Steele's statement:
"In addition, the Tor community has created a community council to
 help to resolve intra- community difficulties, and it is developing
 membership guidelines, a code of conduct, and a social contract that
 affirms our shared values and the behaviors we want to model. We
 expect these to be finalized and approved by the community at or
 before our next developer meeting at the end of September."
where/who is this council? what are the ways to participate?
As far it goes for many people who aren't in US and/or have no money
to travel around and/or aren't sexy enough to participate in coding
sprints :^) it is somehow difficult to grasp what ways are there to
interact with these developments. This also makes it frustrating for
coordinating each other on the advocacy of general ideals which we all
have nurtured even before Tor existed.
I can well speak for our collective here, we all love the Tor project
in its own limits and puberty and big merits, but it is very difficult
to understand how to link our efforts to its Inc and/or community, as
well share some solidarity and reflections. Perhaps the scene-like
dynamics and bullyism have a role in this, yet I don't really believe
so. I hope efforts will be taken so that the Tor "community council"
won't be something even more exclusive than it has been so far.
thanks for your consideration, I guess noone else in Tor Inc. will
read this anyway.

Interesting. I do have a weird attraction to rabbit holes.
FTR here a DIY "dyndns at home" solution using bind9, git and ssh keys

relays moved to such a setup.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Bittorrent starting to move entirely within 
FTR there are I2P plugins for a vast range of external clients and
even an embedded new client. Oh and BTW there is even a C++
reimplementation of I2P.
why "a bit harder"? look this is what really sets me off in Tor: the
posture of it being an "easy solution" to everything.
Please, lets be frank. I2P supports torrenting on its network since
many years and it works perfectly fine. Beyond that nice, there is no
need for Tor to push more "marketing" to race above "competitors". The
mainstream battle is already won, if there was any. The vision on the
linked gist to conquer a new fronteer to bring more relays to Tor: BS!
To my eyes and those of many others, Tor would be much more credible
if it would acknowledge and respect boundaries. There are
implementations out there that are way less... "institutionalized" and
work perfectly fine for specific uses. Such niches shouldn't be up for
grabs whenever it comes handy, we shouldn't ignore specialized
implementations even if they aren't marketed as Tor. Centralizing all
in one network doesn't do good to anyone.
So now, because of torrenting, is I2P the next Tor? I don't think so.
But I think it would be honest for us to point out people in the
direction of best implementations and there is no doubt that I2P is
the best for torrents.
Hype, marketing and competitive behaviour has never done any good to
F/OSS projects and less than ever to crypto projects, IMHO. and I know
you aren't a shiller grarpamp, hoping you don't take it personal.

true I don't consider the usecase of 100 torrents on seed and/or
download. I must say I fail to imagine its conditions, but lets leave
that aside as its probably my limited interest in understanding such
uses of torrent. your argument on scalability holds.
of course it does. to me it seems very well written.
ACK, didn't realize that
very interesting.
I'll save that for later, haven't read docs on the matter yet.
there is a tradeoff to this. Tor's popularity makes it an obvious
target and we are mostly loosing this arms-race to law-enforcement
monitoring, which is full-on. not sure how hard will be to detect
torrents, but the call for more relays is admittedly useful. however
that may be just me, yet I doubt, I'm so perverted to prefer, whenever
possible, dinky little private networks that are different and serve
different contexts. My dream is a sort of codified scrambling layer
a'la Vecna's sniffjoke. Not scalable indeed.  But who needs big
amounts of data to travel on P2P, really? these are different
IMHO to be really in the dark one should also not be so popular.. but
OK I get clearly Tor is an attempt at a different strategy.
this would be an interesting conversation.... but I'm not capable to
elaborate further via email now. I think you get what I mean. I recommend keeping an eye on naif's posts, he often provides good
hints on where law-enforcement is at with the... counter tor-rorism
they'll provide a boost, but it won't stay unchallenged for long.
you are right such a study is missing

hi there,
missing from the thread, I'd rather include it as a reference
mostly in Italian (idea was born at hackmeeting.org)

ROTFL. we have to include Asbesto in this thread :^D
for a start, on the generic side, lack of POSIX.1b compliance?

@_subject: [tor-talk] release of heads 0.2 live 100% libre torified distro 
dear fellow tor-talkers :^)
with this mail let me bring to your attention heads gnu/linux, a new
live distribution hitting release 0.2 and mature enough for the first
expert opinions and tor-fingering around: heads is not only a version of tails without systemd, which we
consider an enormous new surface of attack many of us don't even want
to be exposed to.
to protect its users from any backdoors in device firmware, heads aims
also to be a 100% Free linux distribution without any binary blobs or
proprietary software, following to the guidelines of the GNU project
at the same time heads linux kernel is patched with -grsec using an
hardened profile and routes all its traffic through tor.
at Dyne.org we are great fans of the tor project and we used to run
exit nodes back in 2005, barely resisting police raids and what
not. now with heads the intention is to thank and give back to the tor
developers and community another useful tool in the family, that's why
we plan to support our mate parazyd on this long term effort.
for those in the tor-dev roadshow willing to give it a shot we left a
copy in the hands of an activist following the tor-dev tour across
Europe these days, in the hope that will be useful.
happy hacking
