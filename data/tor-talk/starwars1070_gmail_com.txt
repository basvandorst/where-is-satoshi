@_subject: [tor-talk] torsocks is broken and unmaintained 
i agree with adrelanos i use tor manly to run a bridge and a relay at my work {we set up a server for that} but i  find it difficult to Macaulay go into sock but on the occasion i use it which is rare besides to connect to an employe computer but if we had a library of tor connection optioned where say a developer could attach his programs and run it through there  when the  c level people go off to other countries we only allow them to use tor to connect back to us if hey don't want to use a vpn some don't but most will although it does make it difficult to make sure tor stays up to date one of the either one of my senior techs or myself have to go pull in the laptops and update them but it easier then somebody piggybacking on there vpn and getting into the databases
