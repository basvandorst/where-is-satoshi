Are there any news since the switch to DuckDuckGo's search results ?

Since the last tor-birdy update, Thunderbird doesn't start (stuck at
"Connecting to ") unless I run TBB first.
Any one experiencing the same issue ?

It is stock TBB with stock TorBirdy.

Nothing happened to disconnect.me except that suddenly they weren't able
to provide their service to Google's search engine. I use DuckDuckGo
already and it's TBB's default search engine.
