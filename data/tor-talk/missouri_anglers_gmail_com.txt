@_subject: [tor-talk] Inquiry about Vidalia/Tor bundle 
I downloaded and installed "PirateBrowser" which is a Firefox browser configured to use vidalia/tor.
I assume this is simply just a browser set up to use an anonymous proxy?
I am not exactly a beginner when it comes to using anonymous proxies.
I have been gathering proxy lists, scanning them with software to see if they are valid/anonymous and configuring my browser to use them for years. However I am no expert.
This Vidalia/Tor has me confused.
The program loads, connects to the Tor network and everything looks and acts well.
However when I check my stats at various websites that I use such as (
my IP address is revealed along with my ISP amd other accurate information.
I also checked  and it says that it is not working.
I am getting no errors. Everything seems to be working properly.
Maybe I am overlooking something simple? Maybe it is not what I thought it was?
Any help would be appreciated.

Thank you for your information.
I uninstalled the "PirateBrowser".
Instead I downloaded the Browser bundle from I hope this will get me started on the Tor network.
Thanks again.

PirateBay is pushing the Pirate browser on their website.
People are not searching for it. They are discovering it while downloading torrents.

Is this a good group for a newbie to ask stupid questions? Or is there another group I should be involved with?

I have an email client (Sylpheed) that I use to download email from gmail and others.
Can this be configured to send/receive through the Tor network?
Where would I find information on doing this, assuming it can be done?

Has the security of "Simple Mail" been discussed yet?
If so, can someone tell me where I can find the past discussions?
If not,   Simple Mail is a mail client add on for Firefox. It allows you to get notified, read and write messages for multiple email accounts "inside" Firefox. Does it maintain the privacy associated with the TOR Firefox browser?

I suppose the best way to test this is to send myself an email using "simple Mail" and then run the headers through something like SPAMCOP.NET and see if there is a trace of my ip address/ISP found.
I am not really tech enough to go much beyond that.
Is there something else I can do to test this?

In my attempt to set up a secure anonymous email system I thought it might be easier to sign up for a free web based email account while using the TOR browser.
Do you know how hard it is to do that with java script disabled?
I must have tried 30-40 different places such as yahoo, gmail, gmx, hotmail, etc.... No java script, no account.
I assumed if I signed up while using the TOR browser then they would never have an IP address associated with the email address.
I finally found "ATLAS.CZ" which let me sign up without java script enabled.
However during the process I realized the "CAPTCHA" code they wanted me to retype was using symbols I did not have on my keyboard.
I finally solved that problem and now have a working email address (in Czech) that has never been exposed to my real IP address. (I was using TOR browser through the entire process)
My question is, Can I count on being anonymous if I continue using the TOR browser to log into the web based account and send emails? (java script is always disabled).

Pardon my ignorance on this matter but,
If I go to "lelantos.org" and pay for a new email account how do you avoid relating my paypal, credit card or other method of payment to my new " account.
It seem that to pay for something you need to share personal information.
When you share personal information to purchase an email account I dont see how that keeps the email address anonymous.
Not that I mind paying something as valuable as a truly anonymous email address, I just dont see how that works.???

Hulu requires JavaScript to work properly.
If you enable  JavaScript when visiting the site
does that not defeat the purpose of using TOR?
