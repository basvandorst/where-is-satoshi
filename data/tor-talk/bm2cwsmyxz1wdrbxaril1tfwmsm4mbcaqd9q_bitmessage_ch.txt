What about Robert Hogan's "torora" browser for use with Tor
( I recall Tor people wanted to help
him, or help with funding, or something, and Robert declined.
Anyone have word about its current state? Looks like it was last worked
on in 2009?

Alice Anderson:
AdBlock doesn't actually block ads from loading in the browser, it only
blocks the browser from showing them to you. So, there could be some
small page rendering speed increase from using AdBlock, but no gain in
anonymity AFAIU.

Andrew Lewman:
It's trivial to turn-off their whitelist, but that still leaves a
AdBlock that doesn't really block ads . . .

@_subject: [tor-talk] best distro to use Tor 
Hi Gerardo
Great question! This has been on my mind for some weeks.
I've been thinking a lot of Whonix over the past few weeks, I use it in
VM to play with it, and I like it. After all the Snowden leaks I want to
get away from Windows as my main OS, and I'd like to use transparent
proxy for Tor (using TBB on Windows isn't good enough, thanks for
proving that, NSA (waves at NSA spooks reading!)).
The bonus here is using an OS that Tor devs use, not a second-thought OS
they have to support but would rather not (in a perfect world).
I've used Ubutnu, Kbuntu and Whonix.
I use Win 7 x64 for my work system, I need Word, Skype and the other
Windows programs for my day job. So I'm forced to keep Windows around.
Does anyone reading this list use Whonix as their main OS? Would anyone
caution me against using Whonix as a main work OS (coming from Windows,
but not a newb with *nix)?
I am thinking about buying two computers, connecting them via cable.
The problem is I would need to run Windows 7 in a VM in Whonix, that may
cause trouble due to transparent proxy, so maybe a vanilla distro would
be better for me?

@_subject: [tor-talk] What are some free and private email providers? 
Joe Btfsplk:
I too use Bitmessage.ch by their hidden service address (SSL). I use
Torbirdy with Thunderbird.
When I send emails to people I just enter a name into Thunderbird and
that's the name a recipient sees. The email address of course is long,
but I haven't found anyone that seemed to care.
I dont send big files though, the 2 mb limit is low.
A trace of an email sent through Tor and then Bitmessage and then to the
recipient shows Tor exit node IP address, without usable metadata AFAIU
what Bitmessage.ch does for metadata.
There's a new Tor Mail Gateway coming online and it sounds bad ass:

Joe Btfsplk:
Yes, scanning is still an issue, just like if one used Gmail, Yahoo
mail, etc., instead of Tor + Bitmessage Mail Gateway. Scanning can/does
happen at a few points along the email path.
Using Bitmessage Mail Gateway (bitmessgae.ch) with Tor means the
recipient see's the Tor exit node IP address.
I have found a few commercial email address (to business) drop the email
due to the IP address, but not even 5% of the total emails Ive sent I
would guess, are blocked.

I was thinking about this to get around IP blocks on Tor exit nodes:
My computer (SSL) > Thunderbird + Torbridy > Tor (not using hidden
service to bitmessage.ch) > Internet > VPN > Internet > Bitmessage.ch >
Internet > Recipient
Not sure if that's possible or easy with VPN and Bitmessage Mail Gateway??

Joe Btfsplk:
I was thinking about tacking a VPN after the Tor exit node, before the
Bitmessage Mail Gateway, to hide the Tor exit node IP address. But im
not sure if that's possible. AFAIK VPN can be used to send email
(POP/SMTP) but i dont know if what I was thinking about would work.

Hey Mick,
Maybe I am not explaining myself well or maybe Im ignorant and dont see
what you see (the latter is most likely  ).
All I was thinking about was placing a VPN between Tor and Bitmessage,
so the Tor exit node isn't seen by the recipient.
I could be wrong but i thought VPN could be used with POP/SMTP, so I
thought maybe such as VPN could be placed between Tor and Bitmessage,
relying of Bitmessag's SSL to protect content from the VPN after it
leaves Tor network.
I could be totally wrong because im about as far from an expert as one
can be and still use this list..
The "> Internet >" parts were just to show the traffic leaves one
network, travels in the Internet to the second server (VPN) and then
travels in the Internet to Bitmessage.ch.

Antispam 06:
OnionMail anyone?
Here's a Google translation of the text from Italian to English:
"OnionMail is an Open Source mail server designed to work through the
Tor network. Useful to create Tor Hidden service e-mail.
funziomento of The OnionMail is virtually identical to any other SMTP /
POP3 with some details and functions interssanti specifically designed
for use on the Tor network. With this mail server can send and receive
email from the Internet and tor increasing your privacy and protecting
the metadata."

@_subject: [tor-talk] OT - Stop Watching Us NSA rally on 10/26/2013 
For those interested and close enough this rally to attend:
About the rally
Right now the NSA is spying on everyone's personal communications, and
they?re operating without any meaningful oversight. Since the Snowden
leaks started, more than 571,000 people from all walks of life have
signed the StopWatching.us petition telling the U.S. Congress that we
want them to rein in the NSA.
On October 26th, the 12th anniversary of the signing of the US Patriot
Act, we're taking the next step and holding the largest rally yet
against NSA surveillance. We?ll be handing the half-million petitions to
Congress to remind them that they work for us -- and we won?t tolerate
mass surveillance any longer.
Who we are
StopWatching.us is a coalition of more than 100 public advocacy
organizations and companies from across the political spectrum. We came
together in June 2013 to demand the U.S. Congress investigate the full
extent of the NSA's spying programs. Go here to read our letter to U.S.
Congress demanding accountability and reform.
