Yes, I have already adapted the TBB browser to proxy the package installed tor service. This just entails stripping out the tor elements and treating the browser as a relatively clean Firefox pointing to the appropriate proxy. Obviously, the benefit of the tor service is UID, allowing it to be specified in IPTables. But Vanilla Tor is poor, will rarely get off the ground, and has little defence; and there is minimal pluggable transport support in packages without a lot of work. The idea, instead, is to have the tor service, configured in init.d/tor and the tor-defaults file, to point to the TBB binary and its pluggable transports (all in Tor and Data in the TBB folder structure). This should be feasible, since the TBB folders contain everything needed to run Tor, and the tor system daemon installed by the debian package is configured in /etc/init.d/tor and the tor-defaults file in /usr/share/tor, allowing it to be pointed at the TBB binary. I can't find anything that configures pluggable in the system beyond the torrc config file itself, so it is unclear how to ensure the tor binary uses the transports in the TBB folder, unless this is incorporated in the binary anyway. This would be radically unlike any version of tor I've seen run, and advantageous, since it benefits from the tor daemon, allowing a hard iptables policy to specify the daemon UID (simply changing the permissions of the TBB package, or creating and assigning a GID is something I have tried and not been able to have work), and from the newer TBB binary and its extensive support for transports, all contained in two folders and constantly updated and easy to update. In fact, in theory, this would be better than installing Tor at all: all that would be required ideally would be the TBB, an edited init.d and defaults file and a script to run. This also assumes that the debian package in installed and simply hijacked to run TBB. Editing init.d/tor is not straightforward, though: the path statements are odd, for a start. I have started to look at editing init.d daemons in Linux for this purpose. But all this will take a lot of trial and error. If there is much more to it, it would help to know. ​Sent from ProtonMail, Swiss-based encrypted email.

I understood that most TB attacks were metasploits - exploitations of vulnerabilties that result from java, flash et al, or other increases in attack surface in browsers. I >despise< the heavy use of java on the net: it slows life down, and is an increased vulnerability, and would love to discourage it. It is also genrally extraneous to requirement, for example email services will work perfectly well without java; animated gifs are cool :)

The profile in question refers to the default Firefox browser profile (in TBB this is in TorBrowser/Data/Browser/profile.default. It may be that if files here are altered, Tor will report the profile as unloadable. Redownload the Browser, or reunpack it from compressed file, and rerun. If the file you downloaded is corrupted, it should show with the checksum or gnupg signature check fail. If the problem is occuring with the Tor Launcher as part of a package installed tor setup, you will have to redownload the Browser through the Launcher. I assume the easiest way to do this is to apt-get remove tor and the browser and then reinstall and try again. Not that the TBB cannot be altered - it can. But some things seem to cause this error and I have seen it myself when fiddling with the TBB profile. ​Sent from ProtonMail, Swiss-based encrypted email.

I recall I encountered an node-box technology on Wikipedia, designed for running tamper-proof Tor nodes such that monitoring was impossible: the system was designed to allow for boot and key authentication only, and could not be snooped. I seem to be unable now to locate the page, but this would solve many of the problems of bad nodes in the Tor network, at least if a filtered network composed solely of such systems were used. Of course, you would wonder why this hadn't been done if it were possible...but then again, while I shrug at what I view as major problems with Tor implementation, Linux security OS provision, and so on, I remind myself constantly that most things in modernity don't work, from products to theories, free or not, so there needn't be a conspiracy involved :)

I am putting Tor on the back seat after months and months of arduously trying to improve Linux distros (several) for this purpose, and looking at the various sec options on offer including Tor, in part for precisely the reasons being described, albeit observed in the Tor Browser Bundle and in secure distro conditions provided by TAILS. Tor Browser is indeed the recommended vehicle for Tor web, for all the reasons cited. I have found its EFF fingerprint woefully degenerated from that seen a couple of years ago, for no reason of which I am aware. Tor Browser does not lack a fingerprint: it is uniform, the intention, like TAILS, being that users become indistiguishable from each other. The EFF profiling page used to produce radically improved results between TBB running under Windows and the likes of TAILS, but I have been surprised at recent results. I have seen this observed only once in forum posts when I searched not so long ago. Feedback evidenc3, more worryingly still, suggests that Tor is doing worse than the notorious DNS leak risk or cross-site fingerprint correlation, et al, including where observed with TAILS. My view, like it or not, and I suspect rarely observed, is that clearnet search engine behaviour using 'privacy oriented' clearnet engines, and clearnet web randomizers, exhibit a behaviour best likened to data analytics associated with commercial tracking, keyword behavioural advertising, etc., in turn suggesting routine capture of torified DNS resolution: since TAILS is regarded a secure Torified solution, it can be considered to be least likely to leak DNS by other means, etc., and provides a good litmus test for this fail. I encourage anyone to explore the problem. Meanwhile, I have had to take a break from the Tor issue. I feel the TBB, which contains everything needed to run Tor and includes all available pluggable transport support in a constantly updated and readily available form, would offer the best way to run Tor under Linux if linked to the Tor service or daemon (ie. assuming Tor's init.d script and tor defaults can be pointed at the data in TBB instead), allowing for iptables isolation problematic or impossible with TBB itself, also a chroot-ideal isolated package - rather than having to deal with the Debian package for vanilla Tor or its single (practically depracated) Obfs3 transport package, or scrape together further transports, etc., and install the Tor Launcher package and then download Tor via its dedicated facility, making the browser impossible to implement for live systems (ie. uninstalled). Again, I wonder why Tor has been implemented in the way that it has and why no one else has suggested this solution. And that's just Tor. Then there is the work in cleaning up an OS to use (Linux is now full of pockmarks and troubles, here, imo, and lacks a serious solution - I actually hate using TAILS for its design and rigidity), and the various other potential components of a secure system, assuming one is even possible, allowing access to various sectors of the web (Clearnet, Tor or I2P, which I lack any serious documentation for, Freenet, etc). Documentation and disinformation has not helped, neither does having to leave trails of forum memberships, emails signups, etc., somewhat counter to the intentions of anonymity and privacy, surely. I am somewhat doubtful that Tor alone really represents the threat the NSA is said to attribute to it, personally. I have seen Tor claimed to have been 'broken' by the NSA, with typical vagueness - though what I see resembles basic data analysis visible in online feedback. I have had to work too long, observe and deal with too many failings, where time is indeed money, and need a break, still more given an apparently insurmountable glitch I do not see observed elsewhere. ​Sent from ProtonMail, Swiss-based encrypted email.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and TBB Issues Needing Good Advice 
So far I have been unable to gain a working torrc and iptables setup for either tor, or, particularly, Tor Browser Bundle. And believe me, I've read, searched and tried - alot. Funnily, many of the security advantages of using Tor are defeated by the need for heavy research and the amount of bad/disnformation out there: Tor is undone by its complications and the lack of clear solutions for heavily secured use.
I would like to be able to run TBB secured with a custom torrc file and iptables policy, but this has proven challenging. Torrc settings and iptables settings for tor itself will not easily translate into TBB, which presents its own specific problems.
For examples, TBB does not run as a service as tor does, so it cannot be isolated in iptables in this way. Userspace and namespace methods, where TBB could be run as a dedicated user or in a dedicated namespace, have so far been tried and failed - and I have found no specific workthroughs for this subject. Userspace or namespace isolation would still be ultimately desirable, and this is one thing I would like to see described for this specific purpose.
As a result I am left trying to isolate TBB by port, which also requires that I define tor ports in torrc. Defining default ports, those that are known, causes TBB to stop working, solved by redefining different ports. Examining netstat shows that TBB continues to open the default Control Port on 9151 in addition to any newly defined ports. It is currently unclear where TBB is set to do this.
Iptables policies of any complexity, providing 'torification' of a system to avoid potential leaks, so far fail with TBB. Policies adapted from those on trac.troproject cause TBB to fail on certain counts, and I am unclear as why certain settings are specified.
VirtualAddrNetwork specified in torrc for TBB will produce an unknown host/port response from iptables.
The various addresses I have seen specified for LAN or IANA are a mystery to me.
TBB seems to be neglected almost entirely in serious discussions of Tor. And yet it is more up-to-date than debian-tor, which currently only offers Obfs3 transports, now somewhat old, in Debian packages, and Meek with some trouble: TBB contains all transports in .py files; it is portable, making it instantly operable in any Debian distro with a few simple (scripted) adjusts, and affording the protection of a 'disposable app', and faster to run than installing Tor and obfs3 on a lacking system, with the Tor Browser only installable via the Tor Launcher package and downloading into debian from the Tor project directly (leaving me unaware of how the browser might be saved for offline installation): TBB can double as a Tor Browser for debian-tor without trouble, but I would still like to be able to run or even adapt to debian-tor) its malleable and rapidly reconfigurable implementation and transports (I assume it might be possible to adapt TBB's .py transports provision to debian-tor, I just don't know how).
My chosen solution is to install debian-tor from stored files, adapt transports from the TBB, and use the TBB as a proxy browser for Tor, with additional hardening (lock prefs) if possible. And to run TBB in itself. All require good iptables policies, which has proven a particular challange for TBB.
Ideally, what is required is:
1. A clear explanation of how Linux solicits and maintains network connections, particularly with regard to public wifi negotiation.
2. A separation of this basic networking functionality required to maintain router access and of the Tor or TBB processes.
3. A clear explanation of all required allowances in iptables, of Tor, including by port if possible, and including of addresses like those for LAN et al. NAT table routing has proven particularly challenging.
4. A method for running TBB with custom torrc, observing the failure of default port specification (which is part of port securing in custom hashed passwords, etc.) and VirtualAddrNetwork (which I assume is due to TBB's lack of service/daemon functionality.
5. Advice for adapting the transports from TBB to tor.
6. A walkthrough for advanced isolation methods like dedicated user accounts, which have so far proven impossible to run with TBB from a separate account, and network namespaces, which appear to be a potentially powerful isolation solution but which I have not seen adapted to this purpose yet, despite being considerably lighter than complete OS virtualisation/containers.
A walkthrough for applying TBB transports to debian-tor would be a bonus.
As I say, all my attempts so far to produce a working custom torrc and iptables solution for TBB have not worked (though TBB itself will run with an 'open' clearnet iptables setup), all my attempts to adapt published iptables setups have not worked, and all attempts to isolate TBB particularly behind userspaces have also failed. Namespaces are not something I have yet seen tried for this purpose. A working TBB setup is of course likely more readily adaptable to debian-tor than vice-versa, with a few minor adjustments.
As it is I will have to go back to using TAILS for any degree of Tor security until the problems are solved, despite the failings of TAILS in my view (rigidity, lack of programmability in scripting, GUI style, etc.) :/
Any helpful advice would be appreciated.

I'm afraid you miss the point.
1. To operate TBB with an attendant IPTables setup, including for reasons of potential leaks, admittedly more of a risk in Torification of other apps. DNS leaks are regarded as a widespread issue, quite apparent in looking into tor configurations, though I personally agree (?) that this smacks of bad programming, perhaps in OS design (though again, this tends to be regarded as more of an issue with diverse proxying). Isolating TBB in iptables has proven problematic, since it lacks a native UID, etc.
2. To operate Tor with the full range of transports: I have started looking at the possibility of operating debian-tor with the transports included in TBB, ie. pointing tor at the pluggable transports and libs in the TBB data and Tor folders, but would love some help with this. This would give the best of both.
3. Further isolating tor or TBB behind a user account, and ultimately a network namespace, which is touted as a light weight container option, but I have not seen documented for this purpose.

Well, by bad I meant any serious hazard to anonymity. The 'bad apple' attack was put forward as long ago as 2006, a full eleven years back. Tor exit nodes have since come under suspicion, and de-anonymization attacks based on entire exit node clusters to which user can be redirected have become a threat. The solution I was referring to, which is alleged to make exit node logging impossible, was Tor Ramdisk, a Tor Project item. The solution would of course be to establish a filtered network based on Tor Ramdisks, throwing out the suspected or actual bad apples. The touting of solutions based on ensconcing a further encrypted tunnel inside a Tor route makes no sense: an encrypted tunnel is simply a straight line to a destination, be it a tor exit node, an ssh shell account, a VPN sever or a VPS account: in each case the encryption last as long as the destination and no more. Anyone routing throught Tor to a shell, VPN or VPS only defers exit node logging to a further link in the proxying chain, if Tor is to be used further, including to access the deep web which can only be done 'raw' through Tor anyway, making exit node logging an inescapable hazard as yet; again, the caveat is that Tor can only provide anonymity, if that, not privacy, and any identifying activity through Tor risks deanon or disruption. Of course, if you just want to use tor to obsfucate your route to a shell, VPS or VPN then.... All that talk of online activity involving emails, forums, the deep and dark net must avoid either identification of any kind and accept potential disruption or destruction of transactions of any kind as a basic hazard, As for my part, I have also observed problems I would attribute to DNS capture on some strange scale, through tor or not: poisoned DNS is an established attack, though I am not quite suggesting this. The problem can only be ascertained by me through feedback using online randomizers, suggesting result washing indicative of behavioural advertising. I leave it at that.

Sorry, but 'shill'? I just grab any email providers I can, the more secure the better, and use them, a gradually depleting online service I would say. Any service I use is used with a knowledge of its limitations, like java-addlement (something I disliked about the Riseup webmail rewrite), Tor friendliness, and so on. I know of virtually no onion web email providers I completely trust now (though I still have a soft spot for Sigaint, in part given its demonstration of java free webmail. Feel free to make suggestions :)
I also umderstand the riseuppers have used their own VPN? Despite all that disparaging talk of VPNs having no privacy and security value at all, from the likes of Linux OS makers to Tor advocates?

True, private commercial and corporate funding may indeed be no better; and in fact, one bugbear is precisely the extreme emphasis of state erosion of privacy in press to the neglect of private interest. Nonetheless, commercial systems are largely regarded as a lesser threat in adversarial terms (though this may be misleading). The reality is largely both, often in collaboration. The state participation, with TOR openly touting its usage by military and law enforcement, also raises the impetus for nation state control of the technology; the implication is that anyone going online with Tor, for one, is facing a system where world powers are vying for control, rather than merely petty criminals, the darker side of the net et al, who are always the top of the bill in dumb renditions of the dangers of the online world. Ideally, of course, all this would be crowd funded by its users. GRSec complained of its implementation by free users (particularly among the Debian community, I think) only to drop its free software availability, depriving the Linux community of one kernal hardening method (for those who can be bothered to work this hard - a note I add feeling an ideal OS should be available anyway - I would pay to see it developed GNU). SELinux, linked to the NSA, is left. My feeling is that an ideal Linux security OS is sorely lacking, astonishing given its prolific permutations, and that TOR itself remains troubled for all the reasons I have cited: implementation, the war for exit nodes and their risks, and what appear to be a failure of secured DNS, judging from the 'poisoned DNS' impression made by online feedback. I rarely bother to fire up Tor now when using the net due to being unsure of its definite security value. ​Sent from ProtonMail, Swiss-based encrypted email.​

One solution for actual electronic device signature profiling (which is an exotic attack) would be to use a wifi dongle when you access the net securely. This delivers a completely distinct (or any number of distinct) wifi device signatures rather than mere MAC address spoofing et al since wireless access is handled by an external USB device. ​Sent from ProtonMail, Swiss-based encrypted email.​

Considerable study has been done in this regard. Bitcoin anonymity can only be guaranteed where transactions - the purchase of bitcoin itself - cannot be tied to a real world account and identity.

I have considered it, as I explored various distros, most buggy and by no means secured out-of-the-box, in my view. But I have had such a nightmare experience working to any degree of satisfaction with Linux, I am reluctant to work on anything more stripped down. Alpine Linux was another option I looked at, for example, but there is no readily available Live CD - you have to build it yourself from command up (ideally from chroot, I think, to provide the basic packages and a desktop), then find a way to make a live distro from it. I remember looking at the BSD site and downloads and pondering on what I would have to do to get a working live boot...But I have been generally disappointed by the lack of an ideal secure OS ready to go with which I am happy. OS work has been put on the backseat for me for now :) I need a break from it. ​Sent from ProtonMail, Swiss-based encrypted email.​

I just took a look at availability of FreeBSD Live ports - not mainstream, you say, although I think there are inherent advantages to running live systems (in part implied in why TAILS opts to be so by definition - my own pref is to exceed this and run the live boot image without ever installing it, making it continuous at each boot without being affected by usage, and capable of being reestablished and redeployed rapidly in case of failure). GhostBSD is one example, Frenzy is another. The latter, pondering defunctness, also illustrates another problem with distros in general, and the Linux road is littered with abandoned attempts, distros that are no longer supported, and so on. Repo operating systems need Repo support, and a constant user base that includes its developers. I also took a look at the Tor/Tor Browser Bundle issue with regard to BSD, where I see many have issues using the two together, as if Linux in this regard did not presenr enough. I have just had month after month of problems with Tor implementation - though not with the simple act of running Tor per se. I feel TBB is also superior, and would like to run Tor as a daemon from it, which no one seems to be doing. Many of the security issues derive from online operation -  withness the kerfuffle over DNS leaks - rather than OS kernel security itself (most pertinent to containment, in my view). The problem for me with Tor, as what should be one arm in a repertoire of secure systems that are largely unimplemented by default in most - and most security - OS's - is the potential lack of security or anonymity of its exit nodes, to which Tor Ram Disk was supposed to offer a solution but is unimplemented.
I became very tried of the work, and of the minefield of security advice, applications, and over-proliferation of problems associated with online security as a whole, including with regard to Tor. TAILS for me was a non-solution - rigid, not generally receptive to Debian's support for software, lacking VPN/I2P/Freenet support, over-committed to Tor alone, and what I felt was an awful front-end. I at least want to use an OS with a slick and approachable GUI. Fedora is now among the few OS's offering kernel hardening as a matter of course - and in my experience was riddled with bugs, despite being the apparent source for Redhat. ​Sent from ProtonMail, Swiss-based encrypted email.​
