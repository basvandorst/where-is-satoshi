Perhaps your most pressing concern should be about whether or not it

that.  And any failure to do so would have the side-effect of making Tor

certainly should not be on the forefront of your mind.  It would also be
only minimally useful -- particularly when compared to actively gaging

@_subject: [tor-talk] Be anonymous without Tor 
This depends on what kind of anonymity you are looking for, and from
whom.  The answer to your question is entirely dependent on the nuances
of your life and your concerns.
Real example: my tweets do not broadcast my current location, so they
don't reveal that information to random people who might see my public
account.  But the people who do have access to that location data range
from all of Twitter Inc to my ISP to (possibly) Twitter's marketing
partners to the US government.  But I can have location obfuscation, if
not actual anonymity.  And usually, for me, I find this to be sufficient.
Figuring out the ways that you want to maintain your privacy is the
first step towards actually having privacy online.

A human rights nonprofit recently asked me to set up a PGP public key server as a hidden service.  Lots of people run cozy.io instances as hidden services for "personal clouds" calendar, contacts, task list, documents etc.  A good friend of mine set up his RSS feeds to pipe into a hidden service, and just uses the Tor browser to read the news (even if he's in a filtered location).
   For audio chat, Mumble does okay.  I probably wouldn't recommend it as an enterprise solution when used over Tor, but it's pretty good when using it in push-to-talk mode.

Patches are reviewed by some of the most conscientious and intelligently-paranoid security engineers on the planet.
The constant "but what if nsa?" refrain tries my patience like nothing else. It assumes that both the US government and Tor are monoliths. Neither could be farther from the truth. The ecosystem is also arranged in such a way that the most competent security engineers, cryptographers, and circumvention developers have their eyes on Tor. If someone doesn't trust Tor, then they shouldn't use it. Tor devs consistently push security fixes to Firefox, so maybe they shouldn't use that, either. =P
As for funding, read the tax forms and you'll see where Tor's funding comes from. It's not from the NSA, and I'm happy to stake my reputation on that. I wouldn't be involved if that were the case.

Yeah.  Aside from all of the other legitimate reasons why to not bundle an ad blocker with TBB, this is also a large amount of code (and filtering rules) that are maintained by an outside entity.  Which makes a pretty decent attack vector.
   And also, if you are a filter/autoblocker/adblock/etc, you're deferring to someone else's judgment about what you should be able to see or read.  I say that as a user of adblock who is okay with the tradeoffs (and I whitelist ads on my favorite ad-supported sites).
   I'd be curious about the pros/cons of bundling in something like Privacy Badger, which has a bit of a different approach than things like Adblock Plus.  But this still goes back to the obvious "blob of outside code" and filtering issues that adblock et al have.  I think the best answer goes back to user choice -- users can add these and other extensions if they'd like, but Tor's software is designed to help bypass filters, so baking in filters feels like a step back.

Mumble's pretty cool, but I've yet to try it over Tor.  I'm enamored
with the idea of running a WebRTC video app as a TBB extension/plugin,
with a TURN server run on its own domain or as a hidden service.
Implementation would be tricky.  Deploying a standard TURN server and
WebRTC app on a domain and *then* testing it for stability when run
under Tor would be Step Zero for determining feasibility.  But if
someone's tried a chat either as a user or dev, that would be pretty
  Bummer about freephonebox, though not totally unexpected.  This is a
really difficult problem.[1]
  People have done it as of late October.  My theory is that they're
exiting through nodes that aren't in the MS blacklist yet.  Who knows
how frequently it's updated (every x months, x>1?).
  Three years ago, the answer would have been "way too many."  People
want a human connection, and Skype makes it easy. (Then they sell your
data, invade your privacy, sell out to the censorship regime...).
  Not a fan of Skype =/  But there need to be more options to nudge
people towards.  If it's a thing that doesn't need to be (separately?)

But I *think* this problem is a little trickier than it appears on first blush.  If the site is down because the server is down/seized/wiped, then the onion's key information could be gone too.
   It would be cool if the TBB redirected to the backup onion of a site if the primary domain is down.  cryptic.be > 404! > cryptic000000000.onion
   Problem there is kind of obvious in that it's not easy to get a list of websites which offer an alternate address.

So while you might go to  yahoo.onion is available and gets added to a list of hidden services.  Or site owners could opt-in with relevant information in an onion.txt.  Or visitors could recommend a website for inclusion/spidering similar to either pingomatic or google's old webmaster tools site.  (Note that this paragraph likely contradicts some of Tor's current dev goals around hidden service enumeration).

   For youtube, this is pretty easy, but I've found a script that does the opposite rewrite for the same reason (watch videos without needing flash).  For most video sites, it's the opposite situation, where their embedding scheme requires flash, but you can watch .webm/.mp4 videos on their website.  And I've had embedded youtube videos fail to load under TBB -- the difference could be /v versus /embed in the snippet.

   I was at his sentencing, and can tell you a couple of things about the case.  As it says in the complaint, authorities relied on an informant to say when Jeremy Hammond went offline.  At no point did they say that his location was leaked.  They went to pretty great lengths to force him offline to confirm that he was "Anarchaos" -- but because the link was initially so tenuous, even setting up an IRC bounce would have thwarted those correlation efforts.
   If the feds are watching a chatroom and you don't have a persistent connection, they can track when you enter and exit, even if they don't know where you're physically located.  If you're in contact with an informant, they're giving all of your chats and personal details to their keepers.  Those two things together can be used to target for surveillance (legally, with a warrant).
   It's an awful situation, but has nothing to do with Tor.  In fact, he's restricted from using Tor explicitly for the next 13 years because they couldn't track his location.

=?utf-8?q?s_speed=3F?=
Hey Virgil,
   I'd say that the issue with Tor's speed is one of inconsistency, rather than outright slowness.
   Give you an example:  I was watching a friend set up a new laptop, and she elected to fetch drivers direct from the manufacturer's website.  So someone downloads a few dozen files with the Tor Browser.  Pretty common stuff.  She ran into issues of speed -- at one point all pending downloads failed -- but for the most part the speed ranged from 200kbps to 1mbps.  There are circuits where the connection slows to Pyongyang levels, but for the most part Tor is pretty solid.
   Tor excludes relays that have less than X speed over N period of time, but perhaps the threshhold for X should be raised and length N should be lowered.  My theory is that this would solve many of the "speed issues" that people experience.  Perhaps try simulating these differences with Shadow and report back your findings?

There's also the issue where a small number of relays fail to update, and are eventually excluded from the network.  These people still think they are contributing, and because they don't have email addresses, there's no way to let them know that they need to update.  It's not impossible to have an OTR/email address (etc) and still be anonymous.
   Especially for exits, there should be contact information.  It's a fairly minor requirement when compared to the time and expense that running an exit entails.  Middle nodes?  Maybe not.

Hey all,
   So Satori is this app for Google Chrome that distributes circumvention software in a difficult-to-block way and makes it easy for users to check if it's been tampered with in-transit.  I've been kind of obsessive about it, and now that it's been released, I'd love to see what the Tor community thinks. :D It's basically *just* been released, so I'm seriously looking for critical feedback and bugs to squish.  People seem to like it, but Satori is far from perfect.
Code:  (download the zip)
App:  (to install directly)
* Tor Browser Bundle v3.6 for fifteen languages for Linux, Windows, and * Mozilla Thunderbird v24.4 - email client
* Enigmail v1.6 - encryption plugin for Thunderbird
* TorBirdy v0.1.2 - allows you to send and receive email over the Tor * GPG4Win v2.2.1 - required to gpg-encrypt email
* Guardian Project apps (not yet implemented)
To test the github version (requires Chrome):
1) go to chrome://extensions
2) check the Developer Mode checkbox
3) click Load Unpacked Extension
4) select the Satori/chrome folder
This will add it as a packaged app, and you can open the app by clicking its icon in chrome://apps/

@_subject: [tor-talk] Satori (this crazy app thing I've been working on) 
Sorry for the delay in responding.  Life gets in the way sometimes.    So it offers downloads from places that are not currently blocked or MITM'd: Google's Chrome Web Store, Amazon, and Github.  Which seem unlikely to be due to various economic factors at play.  This is mostly my opinion, though backed by research I've done in this area.  Granted, distributing from these three sites could change the equation for censors, but right now it works very well.
   Fetching .crx files from the Chrome Web Store is particularly devious, as these are unlisted extensions across a few accounts.  These download as zip files which contain the Tor Browser Bundle.  This option is only available for Chinese, Farsi, and Arabic, as it takes a fairly large amount of time to set up.  Downloading from Github or Amazon is more straightforward, and downloads the usual .zip file.  The bundles aren't modified in any way, so the sha256 checksums and gpg signatures should be verifiable across torproject.org and its mirrors.
   I've been weighing fetching the files via torrent with something like bitford or bittorrent torque built-into Satori, but haven't come to a solid conclusion on it. It's technically possible to do so, but there are questions in my mind that need to be resolved before I think this could be a real solution. Mostly because it's easy for a censor to just start seeding a given torrent and then tally IP addresses of people downloading. Another is whether the trackers would just get blocked outright (and running a tracker on AWS sort of loops back around to the idea of a single point of failure).
   Thanks! ^_^
   I'm not sure whose call that is, tbh.  Happy to keep it a personal project =)  And UI/UX feedback is always welcome.
   True. I'm planning to add a stylesheet for screen readers (which would hide the  entirely), along with WAI-ARIA attributes[1] to make it more accessible overall.  I really like the background, but might nix the space theme and go with the polygons on black instead.
   Agreed.  Currently leaning towards replacing A/B/C with download icons that indicate the source.  That sentence is super dry, but I think you get what I mean.
   Yes!  First, download the zip from github: * Go to chrome://extensions/
* ? Developer mode
* Click "Load unpacked extension"
* Choose Satori/chrome directory
   Then go to chrome://apps/ to launch (this is the apps page).  Once development slows a bit, the goal is to have gpg-signed releases in the github repo.  So that way it's possible to independently verify that the app came from me and still use it without logging in to google.
   Oh butts, I didn't even notice those! :D  Will fix!
   Thanks, though the Google Closure library really does the heavy lifting on that.
   Will do!

Thanks! ^_^ A firefox port is not planned for various reasons, but I'm looking into an Android app.  An activist approached me some time ago after their network was having issues getting backdoored Firefox extensions, which is what led to Satori's development.  There's less to lose for a censor by tampering with FF extensions in-transit than MITMing all connections to Google's distribution networks.
   Large projects like Whonix and Tails won't be added just due to their shear size.  SSL is throttled pretty heavily in certain locales, so it seems likely that the request would time out for those who need it most.

Hey Patrick,
Most newspapers have a taste for the salacious, and the DailyDot is not exempt from that criticism. People buy drugs online (which is incredibly stupid for several reasons), but that is in no way the largest use case for hidden services. Not even close. It sells papers (and their digital equivalent) because it's exciting, but as you point out there are plenty of exciting and mundane parts of this community worth writing about. The trick is finding them.
The people behind PubLeaks have set up 42+ hidden services for newspapers and journalism organizations in the Netherlands. Start there.
Then talk to SecureDrop. Talk to TorServers. Go through the public list of core Tor contributors and read about what they're working on. Reach out to domestic violence organizations and see how they are helping people stay safe. Find out the conferences that we present at, then see what related topics are presented. Read papers from this year's USENIX & FOCI. Go to 31c3 in December and the Circumvention Tech Festival in March. High five some people. Approaching the community as a whole is a good idea, but you've got to approach existing organizations that either do outreach or have run successful projects in circumvention. It's not always obvious who those people are, but small steps will get you there.
And now for some complaints: I've seen some steep assumptions in your articles. Your Firefox piece in particular needed, you know, confirmation of facts. It seemed entirely speculative. There have been other, more minor errors that should have been caught. Judicious fact-checking absolves many sins. I also don't think it was fair to imply that one specific person was the cause of (eg) targeted surveillance. In my case, it's *definitely* not the cause. While Jake and I have a habit of disagreeing*, at the end if the day, the fault must rest with the oppressor not the oppressed. The fact that we are colleagues and have both had issues at various times *is* related -- but only because we work in a space that is being unfairly targeted! We all spend too much time fighting each other when we should be fighting for our freedom. Ugh, humans.
* about effective activism, about the relative fluffiness of cats, about whether orange looks good on anyone, about the sky, about whether we've eclipsed Foucault's vision of the control society and moved into an undefined panoptic society, about browser-based cryptography (it's fine, dammit), about closed-source cryptophone vs open-source diy setups. Frankly, we can fight about insufficiently toasted bread if the timing's right and we're both in a bad mood, let's be honest.

People have taken it upon themselves to run relays on raspis, but that's not exactly Tor's fault.
   It seems really obvious not to run a relay off of an extremely low-power computer.  IRL, I always try to convince people not to do it, but it rarely works.  Honestly I would recommend against it even for a bridge, but there's something to be said for having increased address diversity at the expense of performance.  (But I *also* don't want bridge users to be penalized for needing to use a bridge).
   Raspberry Pis are decent for most running hidden services, however they suck royally for relays.
   But to answer your actual question: because we each only have a finite amount of time and can't respond to every thread.  As for what to run a relay on, there are very small servers that run about $100 that get the job done.
   I follow the "1 rule" -- At a bare minimum, 1GB RAM & 1Ghz CPU, connected via ethernet, with "RelayBandwidthRate 1000 KB" set in torrc. This is for a dedicated machine that only runs a relay. Not a raspi, not your phone, not a cafe wifi in Kamchatka. Test your internet speed before setting up your relay and you may be pleasantly surprised at how much throughput you can get. =) Helping the network is really important, but you want to make sure that you're not actually hurting the network on accident.

But a couple of years ago, I bought a $35 refurbished Dell desktop with 1GB ram and ~1ghz processor, and it ran Tor relays beautifully.  One of the main benefits of the software is that so much work has gone into making it light and compatible with a myriad of systems, so that Tor doesn't *have* to manufacture new hardware.  There are lots of issues with hardware projects and it costs an obscene amount of money -- not to mention the implications on security and anonymity that it would    I do agree that there should be a note about what a base level system looks like.  Most of the documentation is in the process of being rewritten, and this would be a great addition.  The discussions around what is the ideal minimum for a new tor node to contribute are ongoing, and will impact the recommendations.
   This could work, but would need a maintainer.  Lots of hosts have pre-made images for other uses, and there are projects like VirtualBoxes[2] that might be good places to distribute these.  An easier way would probably be to use something like a python/bash script or an ansible playbook to install dependencies, set permissions, and detect speed to configure the torrc.
   Just think of the amazing improvements to software and education we could do with a hojillion dollars! :D
   The thing is, the ideal minimum specs to run a tor relay are really low.  Anything you can buy that *isn't* a raspi/beaglebone will probably do okay.  Even the Novena board can run relays.  Even refurbished $35 computers can run relays.  This is a long-solved problem.  Tor doesn't need to solve it all over again.

If the issue is that people don't always have a clear idea of what hardware will work for relays (hardware they likely already have!) then this doesn't even approach it.   If the secondary issue is that people are bummed out that raspis/beaglebones shouldn't run relays, that is *also* not fixed by Tor undertaking a massive hardware project.
   I say that interested people should come up with ideas for how to pull it off, code it up, put it on github with a large "Danger! High Voltage!" warning, and get feedback from the rest of the community. =) That's how people get started and learn.
   A custom image wouldn't necessarily be able to solve driver compatibility issues better than stock Debian/Ubuntu (though Ubuntu is better for quirky hardware than Debian).  If you install Debian and don't have the right ethernet or display drivers, you're still going to use a different machine to connect to the internet and look up the solution.  Because you don't have access to the internet on the missing-ethernet-driver machine.  This is kind of a bootstrapping    This is one of the few projects where I'd say hardware compatibility isn't a factor.  If you can run Debian, you can run Tor (even if you can't be effective as a relay).

I think this is a really bad idea overall, but I'd be curious to see what this would look like in practice.  Do you detect the (unpatched for past five years) Cisco routers on the network?  Do you flag the Intel processor?  Is the closed-source NVIDIA driver a dealbreaker?  I think that everything around hardware has tradeoffs.  Even if something like this existed and worked well, there'd be a push to then just not use whatever software had this bundled with it.
   Lots of people use Tor on not-great hardware because that's all they have access to.

Some people also collected details around the malware and did a bit of analysis.  There is a better repository of this info, but I wasn't able to find it in my notes.  Here are some details:    After a visitor was popped, their system would call back to the FBI's server.  Pretty straightforward.  However, there are a couple of things to note:
1) This is not the first time that Freedom Hosting had been taken down.  onionland folks had hacked them at various points.  Among other reasons, this leads me to believe that they didn't host anywhere near a majority of the hidden services :P  They're barely a blip.
2) People started pranking each other by distributing links to pages with the payload.  That, combined with the relatively mundane nature of most FH-hosted hidden services, is probably why there haven't been a lot of cases to come out of the FH takedown.

It's possible to split the difference a little bit.  You've identified that it's difficult to bring people up to speed technically, and *also* hard to cover most of the ecosystem in a meaningful way.  There are dozens of components and tor-related projects.  While you and Jake both talkfast, there's only so much that you guys can cover in an hour.
   I think it makes more sense to start from the beginning.  Talk about the social problems that Tor tries to solve, and then talk about the technical ways that Tor actually solves them.  Domestic Violence victims are easily tracked via email and other means, so using tor will help prevent that by giving them a different IP address and preventing niche attacks that are otherwise hard to mitigate.  People with serious medical concerns use it to keep their private information private.  Everything from pregnancy to rape to transgender status can cause someone's personal data to be more valuable to big corporations -- or put them at risk of death, depending on location.  Someone wants to look up OSHA regulations anonymously and maybe file a complaint about their dangerous workplace -- Tor helps make sure they're really anonymous through the magic of onion routing.  Anonymous bloggers and journalists need it for the same reason.
   People frequently need to get through filters to be able to speak freely, and as surveillance and censorship technology improves (eg, DPI), then Tor conducts serious research to bypass those measures quickly (Meek, obfs4, FTE).  There's an endless list of use cases and case studies that can be used as entry points into basic technical overview of core components.  Projects like Orchid/Shadow/Cupcake are all great, but don't necessarily speak to what Tor actually strives for

Hey Kyle,
   With Freedom Hosting, I actually don't know.  It seems like few technical details have come out of that case.  However, I *do* know that they'd been hacked at various points, and the service had very poor security overall.  The restrictions in place did not actually prevent php files from creating *other* types of scripts...  Their sandboxing was reputedly quite bad, and for years they had no restrictions on resources that users could utilize.  So creating an app designed to expand to occupy all resources on the server until it crashed was highly effective.  The server itself may not even have kept access logs.  It's    With SilkRoad[2], supposedly investigators imaged the entire drive, so this should still be possible.  In any case, I think it's important to avoid taking the investigators' statements at face value.  Weev mentioned that investigators made dubious technical statements in some places, and while I haven't read all of the documents to come out about this case, that's certainly within the realm of possibility.
   There are likely still details that haven't come out yet about both cases (though I can't know for sure) and it's not entirely clear what level of technical expertise various people have.
Things that are important to note for hidden service operators:
   - Firewall rules are really useful for keeping out unwarranted    - Don't hardcode your IP address in any links (though this is one of the least-likely theories).
   - Having a pseudonym isn't a replacement for excellent security    - Don't run a hidden service host.
   - For best security, run your own services rather than relying on someone else's security.  I feel like this is often overlooked in the name of "easiness" but it's really important IMO. [1]
[1] Incidentally, the hidden service documentation rewrite has been underway for a while now.

No, this can be done very effectively with software firewalls. Though some people are doing more with authenticated hidden services. Some people also divide server and tor processes in some interesting ways.
Don't run a hosting service for others to use. Several people have tried, with varying levels of fail. It's not a good idea. Best-case scenario, you spend a lot of time administrating and removing abusive/illegal content. Worst-case scenario, you're legally liable for the content others post.

For the size-conscious, you can also run a hidden service on a TP-Link 3040, but it gets a lot trickier as you only have 32mb of ram to work with.  For all sorts of reasons I wouldn't recommend being a bridge/middle/exit node while running a hidden service (especially on a router, which is already extremely    OpenWRT and Commotion both come with uhttpd (+cyassl), which is fine to run basic websites and distribute files. It's also built into openwrt.  There's also mini-httpd, which is quite popular.  But if you're already using a flash drive as a surrogate hard drive, the 12kb difference over uhttpd isn't going to really help.  Of course, Apache/nginx/lighttpd are all available.
   The  flash and ram on Ubiquiti pico/nanostations are too low to do much of anything except run OpenWRT and act as access points.  And anything that is power-over-ethernet is going to be very difficult to run a hidden service on full stop.

And never write an email because it's death.  You're giving prosecutors all the evidence we    Much of crime relies on face-to-face trust networks to plan and execute their projects (for lack of a better word).  This reduces the chance that there will be lasting evidence that investigators can use.  Tor doesn't log connections, but that doesn't mean that a criminal wouldn't reveal themselves in other ways.  This is why I always tell activists and journalists that Tor can only be one part of their security plan.
   With online crime, botnets are de rigueur, since you can rent them or easily create them (or pay another criminal to create them).  Criminals use them as proxies to cast suspicion 1) away from themselves and 2) onto someone who is completely innocent.  Depending on how sophisticated a criminal is, they can connect to compromised machines in sequence, making their own pseudo-onion-routing-network.  They can also remove logs and most common botnet software can be configured to remove itself (!) after a certain amount of time or if it can't connect to the command & control platform.  Botnet-based crimes are the ultimate multi-jurisdictional problem, since known victims can be in dozens of countries, with dozens of investigations ongoing and many many victims trying to prove their innocence at once.
   But yeah, there's a lot going on in the world of crime, but the vast majority of it is offline.

Thankfully the Tor Browser works for most users without needing additional configuration.  And there's a discussion ongoing about making a .desktop file that will allow users to simply double-click it to launch [1].  I think that will get Linux users pretty far, but given how mainstream and usable Linux distributions tend to be, Tor may need to do more to reach out and integrate better with the free software community [2].  I'd recommend having a solid showing at FOSDEM, LibrePlanet, DebConf, or possibly even the Chaos Communications Congress.  And maybe the developer(s) could utilize reproducible builds[3].

There are a few more things to consider:
- The flash size of most OpenWRT-compatible routers is 4-8mb.  That 8mb must include OpenWRT (3.9mb) and tor (~3.2mb) plus any dependencies that might be required.  In practice this is way beyond 8mb, and requires USB storage.  This is less `apt-get install tor` and more manually configuring fstab.
- The point about needing to know how to flash a router is an important one.  But users must also know how to update their routers (which typically requires knowing how to flash the router).  This is easy to learn, but does require several steps.
- There are various how-to guides online already that discuss how to create your own torouter.  The price point on this is ~$50, between a TP-Link MR3040, a usb stick, an ethernet cable, and Commotion/OpenWRT/DD-WRT.  So any new commercial product needs to come in fairly low (less than a $100) to be competitive.  For high-quality small hardware runs, this is very difficult.  And out of that budget must come promotion, returns, the R&D process, case design, etc etc.
   For me, having to buy custom hardware is not so much a barrier, as it is a complete non-starter.  TP-Link (or whoever) is a large company and if something goes wrong with the router, I know who to contact.  If a router overheats and causes damage to other electronics, I know who to hold responsible.  `Jim's Torouter, LLC` doesn't inspire the same level of confidence.  For those who *do* inspire confidence (such as Bunnie Huang's open hardware), the price point is too high for most people who would want to buy one.

That is really awesome! :-) Thanks for the update.
On Thu, Jul 14, 2016 at 5:42 PM, Kate Krauss < kate at torproject.org I don't say much on Tor-Talk, but I will say this:
Thanks, Medium, for removing all those CloudFlare captchas for Tor
users. As an activist from East Africa once reminded me, the Internet
means *all* of the Internet. Otherwise it isn't quite itself--it is
meant to be accessible and comprehensive; a nearly inexhaustible catalog
of the world.
Thank you for helping out.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Any updates from Tor Project on ioerror? 
It *is* a bit strange, though not unexpected at this point.  People are going to believe what they want to believe, and will lean on the lack of police involvement despite the fact that the number of rape victims who file a police report is vanishingly small.  Of the couple dozen friends and family who've spoken to me about their experiences with sexual assault, only one succeeded in prosecution.  Her rapist was convicted of "simple assault" (not rape) and got community service with no sex offender registration.  For raping a thirteen-year-old girl and offering to plead guilty.  Much ink has been spilled on this topic, so I won't belabor the point, except to say that this is the trend rather than an exceptional case.
   Interestingly, this logic seems only to apply to rape survivors.  I would guess that these same people defend Edward Snowden's decision to not go to the police about illegal surveillance practices and instead to talk about his experiences.
   Also, the notion that Tor would be hoodwinked by some cointelpro/psyop/conspiracy bollocks is quite insulting.
   Yeah.  These are quite serious allegations and I'm happy that Tor's got a legal firm to investigate.  If people take issue with investigating claims like these, well, that's unfortunate.

Hey all,
   Just a reminder to keep discussions on-topic, and to be conscientious when posting.  Due to the extreme amount of off-topic posting (centered around a handful of users), there's much discussion about whether to replace tor-talk with a moderated list.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Reminder to stay on-topic 
I've been fairly surprised that the response has been almost entirely positive.  The 45-post thread on cypherpunks where Zenaan Harkness called me a "fake man" (classy) notwithstanding.
   And is Zenaan banned?  No.  Is grarpamp or most of the other people who posted in support of Jacob Appelbaum banned?  No.  And is Jacob Appelbaum himself on the ban list?  No.  So please let us dispense with the idea that the handful of people banned from this list are being persecuted for their beliefs.
   There are thousands of people on this mailing list who receive *every* message -- this is not a forum where off-topic posts can be deleted before being seen.  And quite frankly, three weeks of unbridled posting seems like plenty to me.
   Tor is a software project, not a telenovela.  Please keep posts on-topic in the future.  There are endless opportunities to express an opinion online, and everyone is free to seek them out.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor in Haskell & Other Unikernel Tricks 
Found an interesting talk from Adam Wick about implementing Tor (and perhaps onion routing more broadly) in Haskell unikernels. Unikernels are basically single-purpose virtual machines, in this case using HaLVM.
"Adam Wick takes a deep dive into a unikernel implementation of the Tor anonymity system. He discusses what aspects of Tor make it an attractive target for a unikernel, and what aspects of unikernels are particularly interesting when considering Tor."

Hey Aaron,
Just curious if HotPETS allows talks to be given via distance.
There are 10 kinds of people in the world: those who understand binary, those who don't, and people who didn't expect a base 3 joke.

I've had a good experience with Autistici/Inventati -- which is a small Italian co-op similar to RiseUp.  MayFirst/PeopleLink and Electric Embers are also great co-ops that are fine with Tor users, but aren't free.  A/I isn't "free" per se either -- they run on donations -- but there's currently no payment required to use their services.  They have a dozen or so domains that you can choose from.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor honeypot 
Hi there,
   One of the cooler projects like this was Roya's active probing research on the Great Firewall[1].  In her case, she ran a private bridge (not distributed, only for her research use), connected to the bridge once from within China, then watched for new connection attempts.   She also ran a packet capture for a day to help find patterns (as, again, no one's traffic passed through except hers).  And it's easy to run a service on port 9001, do the connection, then remove the service if you don't want to use tor.  =)
   There are lots of misc scans going on, which mostly seem to be curiosity.  Whenever an interesting/weird piece of malware comes out (which opens a rando port), I will occasionally do a scan to see how many machines may be infected.  Funny story: after an NSA backdoor report came out, I found that millions of devices had that port open via a scan.  After a brief freakout, I investigated further and found that a popular "smart TV" used the same port. :D  All of this to say, of course, that the follow-up investigating and research matter a lot heh.

@_subject: [tor-talk] is it me or did tor talk get really quiet? 
His bug was interesting in a few ways.  For one, it appeared weeks after he claimed to have it.  Perhaps most surprising was that senior engineers needed to walk him through the problem he was interested in reporting (by Erinn Atwater & Ryan Duff [2]) before he could articulate it in any meaningful way.  His insistence that it was a Tor-exclusive bug also cost him a bug bounty from Mozilla (their chart would appear to indicate $10k+ for a bug like that).
   It's also worth noting that Tor released a patch the same day the bug was finally reported.  Rotor Browser (jmprcx/movrcx's project) hasn't patched the issue [1], even though Mozilla and Tor both did.
   That discussion happened in Feb/March of this year as part of the Winter meeting.  The upcoming Seattle meeting is the Summer meeting (I know, I know).  The link above shows the outcome of the discussion -- hence "report-out".
