@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor build failed - can't find libevent.. 
Hello everyone,
I go by the name of Air0s & this is my first post to the list so pls bear
with me..
I've got a problem building Tor from source which has to do with libevent..
Check-out the response I got from Nick Mathewson..
So here I am.. I've removed the 1.4 version of libevent but now
I need to set the --with-libevent-dir option or change the CFLAGS/LDFLAGS..
# pkg_version -v | grep libevent
# locate libevent
Question is how & where do I set these flags..?
Much obliged for any feedback..

No need for the snare Robert, but thanx for the help..
I had removed the v1.4 of libevent, removed the tor-0.2.2.35 pkg from the
Db & built the new tor-0.2.3.13-alpha from the
account v2.0 of libevent.
All's nice & peaches you might think but not quite..
Starting the Anonymous Relay Monitor (arm) which I run as a front-end to
keep check on things, it complains with
the following: Unrecognized authentication type: SAFECOOKIE.. And yes I do
have CookieAuthentication as a setting in my torrc, so what else needs to
be done..?

Hi Damian,
Code that I wrote for torctl and copied into arm raised an IOError when it
SafeCookie is making Tor choke with or without the normal Cookie
authentication setting..
Fixed this in arm...
Fantastic.. However though, how do I get it to work again.. I used to have
a pkg installed & could just run ARM as a _tor user but now from the git
clone I did an install into /usr/share/arm/ but I've no clue how to get it
to work.. Pls forgive my stupidity in this but I've never ever worked with
Python before..
