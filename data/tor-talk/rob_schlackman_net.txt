@_subject: question about router depth 
Does anyone know how to set the max number of routers that a tor client  will use?  I am using the Windows version.  How do I know how many routers  I am going through?
Thanks for the help,

I was listening to the security now podcast on twit about tor and I think  they got it all wrong.  They made it sound like you could go through as  many routers as you configure it to do.  I will send them an email.   Thanks for the replies.

I was actually looking to lower the router count to make things faster.   But it sounds like the default setting are set at 3 routers.  So thanks  for all the answers.
