@_subject: [tor-talk] Attacks via Tor? 
Hi there,
I am running an exit node with Tor 0.2.2.33.
Today I got a message from my provider that it has been contacted by owners of
several webservers which have been attacked (through port 80) from my server.
My guess is that Tor has been used for these attacks.
Is there any chance to avoid this scenario?
thx in advance,
