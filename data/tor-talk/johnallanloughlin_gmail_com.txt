Dearest Tor,
Before I download you and start loving you, let's have a little "*dtr." *I
have one question:
How do I know that sundry spies out there will *not*, while I'm downloading
you/signing-up the first time, steal my log-in creds *on the spot *and
follow me right into Tor land?
The question probably reveals me for the non-techie ignoramus I am. But
still...?I have secretive (tho' *legal *and *ethical!*) things to do once I
get there, and I want only the eyes I choose to see what I'm doing.
Alms for the Ignoramus?

Aha! Thank you, Matt.  I'm sure there is more to learn.
In essence, I want to be able to communicate off radar w a specific set of
folks, but wo having to drag them into a darknet arena they may not be
comfy with bc of religious convictions. Nothing nefarious, but needfully
underground for their security.
If I need more than Tor, mind sharing how i might go about securing? It
wouldn't be anything more than text-type communication.
