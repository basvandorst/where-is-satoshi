This is interesting. Did they provide any explanation for this? Your root server, did they have access to the server as well? How did they know you were running a relay, other than looking on your server for a Tor process, or looking into your traffic? What problem did they try to solve by adding your server on a blacklist?

@_subject: [tor-talk] answers of Ms Kroes on EP questions 
Ms. Kroes has answered the parliamentary questions on blocking access to the users of Tor to the website of the European Commission. The questions were:
The Commission is blocking access to its website for users of TOR (The Onion Router). TOR is a technology that enables people to surf the web anonymously. It has become increasingly popular since it played a role in facilitating the Arab Spring movement.
1. Why is the Commission partially censoring Internet access to its site whilst at the same time it is conducting a public consultation on net neutrality?
2. What compromise does the Commission propose between, on the one hand, the goal of transparency that it is pursuing in terms of traffic management and, on the other, respect for anonymity and data protection as advocated by TOR?
The answer of ms. Kroes:
The Commission is committed to maintaining the open and neutral character of the Internet. At the same time the Commission strictly respects the legislation on the protection of personal data. The Commission's public consultation on ?specific aspects of transparency, traffic management and switching in an Open Internet? is open to everyone. The Commission understands and respects that citizens may prefer to stay anonymous when accessing websites hosted on Europa.
Nevertheless, the Commission has the duty to take all the necessary measures to ensure a high rate of availability of its websites for all citizens. The Commission therefore needs to ensure the reliability and security of its networks and websites (and those it manages for other institutions) against (cyber-)attacks. In this context the Commission takes all the measures deemed necessary to mitigate risks and counteract attacks that occur, taking account of the technical specificities of the latter.
Personal data of respondents to the Commission's public consultation is strictly protected in line with EU data protection legislation. For transparency purposes the responses to the public consultation questionnaire will be published. However, all respondents have the possibility to indicate after each question, whether their response contains confidential information. If the respondent mentions that the answer is confidential, it will not be published.

You have probably heard of it already, but just in case you have missed it:  the Dutch government proposed to search and destroy foreign computers. For some background, I'll quote the blogpost from my colleague:
The proposal would grant powers to the Dutch police to break into computers, including mobile phones, via the internet in order to: i) install spyware, allowing the police to overtake the computer; ii) search data on the computer, including data on computers located in other countries; and iii) destroy data on the computer, including data on computers located in other countries. If the location of the computer cannot be determined, for example in the case of Tor-hidden services, the police is not required to submit a request for legal assistance to another country before breaking in. Under the current text, it is uncertain whether a legal assistance request would be legally required, or merely preferred, if the location of the computer is known. The exercise of these powers requires a warrant from a Dutch court.
See  for some more details. Feel free to ask if you have any questions.

"Operation Torpedo began with an investigation in the Netherlands in
  August 2011. Agents at the National High Tech Crime Unit of the
  Netherlands? national police force had decided to crack down on online
  child porn, according to an FBI affidavit. To that end, they wrote a web
  crawler that scoured the Dark Net, collecting all the Tor onion
  addresses it could find.
  The NHTCU agents systematically visited each of the sites and made a
  list of those dedicated to child pornography. Then, armed with a search
  warrant from the Court of Rotterdam, the agents set out to determine
  where the sites were located.
  That, in theory, is a daunting task?Tor hidden services mask their
  locations behind layers of routing. But when the agents got to a site
  called ?Pedoboard,? they discovered that the owner had foolishly left
  the administrative account open with no password. They logged in and
  began poking around, eventually finding the server?s real Internet IP
  address in Bellevue, Nebraska."
The operation is in known in the Netherlands by the name of Descartes.
The name "Torpedo" was their internal nickname for the operation. The
case was a followup to the Robert M.-case, one of the largest child
abuse-cases in the Netherlands.

A web   erawier is a software program that can be used to automatically search   for websites, identify any hyperlinks cantairred on those websites,   and follow those hyperlinks to additionai websites. The NHTCU   configured the web erawier to search for "hidden services" ending in   ".anion" within the Tor network. Severai hundred "hidden services" we   re identified and documented bythe NHTCU. Each of these "hidden   services" was then manually reviewed by the NHTCU to determine whether   it cantairred child pornography. The typos are from the OCR.

Reality is a thing of nuance: although the risks of running a middle relay from home are for more limited compared to running an exit relay from home, there are some things that should be taken into account.
Most notably: the IP-address from your home connection will be listed in one or more block lists, based on the criteria that these lists list all none Tor relays. This may be a problem when site owners decided to deny traffic from IP-addresses that are running a Tor relay. As a result of that, if you run a middle relay from home, you may have difficulties reaching some sites.

@_subject: [tor-talk] trusting .onion services 
I'm wondering...  - How can a user reliably determine some .onion address actually
   belongs to intended owner?
 - How is the provider of .onion service supposed to deal with a lost or
   compromised private key, especially from the point of view from the
   user of this service? How does the user know a .onion-address has
   it's key revoke?
Let me explain...
One of the advantages of using a .onion address to identify the service
you are connecting to, is that you don't have to rely on a third party
as you would do in a system with Certificate Authorities. By relying on
the certificate signed by a trusted CA, the user can be sure the site he
is connecting to is actually belongs to a particular entity. With a
.onion address that is no longer needed since those address are
self-authenticating. Sounds good.
Now, the problem I have is that the user doesn't have a reliable way to
determine whether a given address actually belongs to the site he wants
to visit. As far as I can tell, Facebook has two solutions to this: it
mentions the correct address in presentations, blogs and press coverage
wherever it can and its TLS-certificate mentions both the .onion address
as well as it's regular address (as Subject Alt Names).
So, the first solution can't be done by everyone, not everyone has that
much coverage. The second solution is nice, but falls back to the CA
system. Ironic, isn't it? [1]
Or, to rephrase it: how can a user reliably determine the .onion address
for a given entity without relying on the flawed CA system and without
the entity having a lot of visibility?
Given the fact that the hostname is a derivate of the private key used
to encrypt the connection to that hostname, there is a bigger issue when
the private key is stolen or lost (or any other case where the key needs
to be replaced.)
When the key is lost (yes, shouldn't happen, but shit happens), the
hostname changes. There is no reliable way for a user to learn what the
new key, and therefor the hostname, is.
When the key is stolen (or compromised in any other way), the key should
be replaced. This may be even more problematic than the case where the
key is lost, which would render the site unreachable. When the key is
stolen, the key may be used by an perpetrator. The problem: there is no
way to tell the world that a particular key is compromised. [2] The
administrator is able to make the site accessible via a new key and new
hostname, but the attacker may keep running a modified copy of the site
using the stolen key.
[1] Ironic, as Roger's blog on this topic makes clear there are all
kinds of reasons why we do not want re-enforce this system, partly
because it is flawed, partly because it costs money, partly because it
undoes the anonymity that some hidden sites need, partly because...
[2] OK. Not entirely true, maybe. It may be possible to include those
key in some listing of the directory authorities marking them as bad
nodes. This is a manual process.

Yes. That sounds like a nice setup - however, with all respect, not one that will be adopted in a safe way by the majority of the people. It is not "broadly accessible". I like it a lot that sites like Facebook are accessible as a .onion-service as it will make these kind of security accessible to a broad group of people, including those with a less strong technical background. They (no, we all!) should have more accessible means to verifying the ownership of a .onion-address.

Yes. Just to make sure: this would solve only the problem that a key of HS may become compromised and some way of revocation should be available. It doesn't solve the other issues (as, making sure that some key actually does belong to the intended/expected owner).
The owner could create the revocation message right away and store it somewhere safe, just to make sure that if the key is stolen ?nd deleted, the owner can still create a revocation certificate.
