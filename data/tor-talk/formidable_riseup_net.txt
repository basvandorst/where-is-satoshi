I can't get how they can spy by UTC?
If i sends it at UTC+6 and he received it same time at UTC-6,
receiver will find in header UTC time.
So whats the problem, how can he convert it to +12? oO
It seems to be paranoid style worrying about date time header.
Problem is when Date header not set to UTC, but torbirdy make it UTC.
