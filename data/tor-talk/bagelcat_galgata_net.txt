the guest systems in parallels gets  unique ip?s from your local dhcp- server (router). It looks like a "real" computer in your local lan.  So you can make connection inside your lan the same way you do for a  real system.
You have to look for the ip of you mac-system (e.g. 192.168.0.2). Use  this ip in the proxy settings of firefox in your guest-systems.
Of course you have to change the privoxy-setting to allow connection  from your lan-ip-range. Change in the file config in your privoxy  Folder (usually /Library/privoxy/) the setting "listen-adress  127.0.0.1:8118" into "listen-adress: "your-mac-ip":8118". You have  also to look for your firewall-settings etc.
nice system anyway, isnt it? .-)

You do not need to change the setting in privoxy back. Just point the  proxysetting of your browser on the local client (where privoxy is  running) also to the LAN-IP adress instaed of localhost/127.0.0.1 and  everything will be fine. .-)

@_subject: Analyzing TOR-exitnodes for anomalies 
Ive got this strange behavior also now several times when using tor.  Always there is a redirect with "landing.domainsponsor.com" wich have  the registrar Oversee.net .
A self-description of that company:
"Oversee.net is a technology-driven media company that delivers  innovative advertising solutions in the search (information.com),  display advertising (revenue.net), and lead generation (low.com) and  (degrees.com) segments. Oversee.net is also emerging as the pioneer  of next-generation consumer properties. "
I looks like they have found strange ways for advertising.
The exitnodes wich connect to domainsponsor.com are always locate in  US (all US nodes I have seen are located in texas or US without a  more exact description). One Time the exit node was located in DK.
Ive got "url not found" messages with every DE and UK nodes I have  hmm. I think this is a problem with some dns-server on second/third  level wich make a link to that domainsponsor.com when they are asked  for a not registered url. Is it possible?
much fun

ok i have played now for more than an half hour with nonsense  domainnames. every time the connection goes through an exit node  located in texas, one time in the state new york and one time in  denver i have got the advertising page.
maybe it will be a nice test, that someone unsing the same ISP - and  in that case maybe the same dns-route - that one of this strange exit  nodes have will test what happened when the write a not registered url?
I have also got the advertising one or two times when I was  connecting to an exisiting page. But it seemes that nonsenses  domainames are a good way for testing cause you can reproduce the  much fun

yes. I have made more test an seen via vidalia, that the advertising  pages came up when the exit node uses the dns-server NS1 or  NS2.oversee.net (mostly 204.13.161.20 seen).
I?ve made a break now for myself in privoxy, reconfigure it to use  socks4 forwarding instaed of 4a. So I have to live with the tor-dns  break. I will see if this is a fast help for now.

Hash: SHA1
i2p is not realy new.-) The Version History started in 2003.
I have some expirience with it, but i think its offtopic here. Or  not? well just a fes comments..
- - it a java-app running on java 1.5
- - like to get a lot of cpu time+ram
- - like to produce a lot of traffic (garlic-routing)
- - it is much slower than tor (my opinion)
- -creates a darknet wich anonymize the traffic only, NOT the  connection itself
- - it is possible that i2p can have a great future. But there is alot  of work to do.
that articel has some mistakes in it, not very well researched at all..
bagel (feel free to pm me)
