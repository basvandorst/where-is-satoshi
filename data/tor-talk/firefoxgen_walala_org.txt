Strong MD5 or blowfish crypted root password and IDS man. also chroot prisons and eliminating those services you don't really need running all the time. Denying root log-in is good too (have to log in as standard user than su to root. attackers need to know both passwords rather than just one).

FF does SOCKS 5 securely, so I don't see why you couldn't. The only reason I do is because I'm paranoid and use Squid to filter out some http headers. Squid doesn't  know SOCKS, so I need privoxy for http--->socks translation. Unless you're doing what I just described, you shouldn't have to.

The latest  stable (1.0.6) operates without causing any screen messages when tor is set to 'notice' loglevel. Programs known not to do DNS in a safe manner do result in such notifications. When did you last review the source? I'll do a local ethernet sniff w/ Etherial if you would like further verification (it's late right now otherwise I would just do it

Damnit! Aparently Dingledine was right. Etherial picked up the DNS queries. It seems that just because Tor doesn't say that there's a problem, it doesn't mean that there isn't a DNS leak going on. Could this behavior (or lack thereof) be considered a bug?

Arrakis, what is the about:config entry's name and value? I can try adding it to my 1.0.x config and see if it does anything. BTW, further testing yesterday has shown that 1.0.x in fact does do SOCKS4/5 correctly, as long as you have the 'enable proxy for all protocols' or whatever box checked. HOWEVER, we have discovered that Squid insists on doing its own DNS lookups, and there doesn't seem to be a way to change this behavior. Thus, I am going to append a warning/notice of depreciation on all related pages on the Wiki (there's only one or two of them). Although Squid can filter out those evil headers (which I really like), the fact that it DNS leaks cancels out any of these positive effects.

OK. It doesn't actually make any difference though. This would thus lead one to surmise that this functionality must be hard-coded "on", and the setting in FF 1.1x simply allows to you turn it OFF when you could not previously (why anyone would want to in general I dont know).

As for the opt-time stuff, I'd venture a guess that it has to do with the last time your verified and/or posted to the "currently active" directory listing that all the Tor clients and servers use.

Some would argue that it's just the free market doing it's thing, and some entrepreneur is cashing in ;D. What's the name of that self-contained, 'USB-stick' Thurnderbird and Firefox? I can't think of the name right now. It would probably be really easy for Arrakis to add this to his project. The one thing that's nice about VPM though is that it is cross-platform and contains a few extra security features that would be hard for a non-geek to configure. The reason I say this is because there are many dedicated freedom activists in the US and around the world that are just dying (sometimes literally) for something like this, but don't have the technical know-how to self-implement.
Arrakis, do you need help with TorPark? If so, I'd be willing to chip in, at least to a degree.

If my exit node was still at home and not here behind this university firewall, then I'd be all over it ;) In leiu of that, I have an idea/question. As far as I know, Tor doesn't do any kind of DNS name caching when operating as an exit-node. What do  you think of crypted, in-RAM DNS look-up caching? The utility of this feature would be twofold. First, there would be slightly better performance. Secondly, and more importantly, you'd have less DNS look-ups over time, meaning that it would be just that much harder for an exit-node sniffer to get ideas about usage patterns. This might also have the added bonus of relying on the OS's native DNS cache as much, which is assumed to be insecure cleartext.

This is not *entirely* related, but I'm typing it here before I forget, which can happen quite suddenly at times! My question is: I've picked up that Tor compression has been considered, at least in passing, before. What algorythms were considered? Just gzip or something else? I've used Guttman and VanSomebodyOrOther algorythms, at least in the context of ethernet frames/TCPIP and it gains about 8-10x more throughput on avarage. The problem is that they require all the routers in the path to actually support compression, which doesn't often happen.
    I guess the bottom line here is: Can plain old generic SSL be compressed, or is that functionality specific to the SSh toolset itself and not the SSL protocol proper?

The reason I ask is that my server cannot be accessed by clients from the outside due to a university firewall. Both the connection here and at my remote location are pretty fast, so I think opening a forwarded port over there to over here would be relitavely low latency.
    I definitely want to check this first though to make sure that others can actually get some use out of my node.

Wouldn't that make it even more insanely slow and inconsitent than it is already? Also, unless you're doing either just one host's connections or a large group of connections, it doesn't seem to make sense. If it's 2-5 hosts or something, it doesn't seem like it would have a very good security/resources ratio.

@_subject: Re[FF]: How-To route other protocols through Privoxy (e.g. IRC) 
It's really two different ways to get the same result. If you wanted to, you could apply all of FasterFox's settings via about:config. The only reason I have both is because Firefox has been around much longer than the Fasterfox extension, and when I wrote the docs originally manual was the only option. Do other readers find this unclear? If so, I can easily go back and add a sentence laying out the options verbatim. Personally, I just use FasterFox with the Optimized or Turbocharged setting. You can do some playing around with stuff, but I've found that while Turbo is sometimes a bit faster than Optimized, it will make some servers be unable to send you content in full or sometimes even at all, as that setting uses settings outside of the official RFC specs. That said, I'd try Optimum first to make sure every thing's working, and then try your luck with Turbo after you've eliminated any other quirks.
Hope this helps,

Dear Roger,
    Why does Tor support SOCKS 4 and 5 protocols but not 4a? Getting this implemented would surely eliminate the security risks and user-end headaches associated with using other applications to get around this     Alternatively, if there's some reason why this has to be the case, has anyone thought of doing one of the following as a work-around?
A. Setting tor-resolv as the system's default name-server via some registry (win32), shell (unix) or stack-level hack?
B. Configuring BIND/named via it's own config files and/or iptables to resolve DNS names via tor on port 9050. If named is caching names in a secure way, you could speed resolving up a bit too perhaps.
C. If I'm wrong about all this, please feel free to just slap my ass and call me 'Sally' :D

@_subject: Free SSh access that allows port forwarding 
I was planning on doing some testing to see what the performance would be like for tunneling tor over a remote SSh connection to allow users to connect to my server though this WAN firewall. Unfortunately, it looks like my SSh server back home is not responding, and no one there of course knows how to fix that. Thus, I'll need to find a third party SSh host that will allow me to forward the appropriate ports. I have an sdf.lonestar.org and a silenceisdefeat.org account, but neither seem to allow port forwarding.
    Does anyone on this list happen to know of a very cheap or ideally free service that I could use? Perhaps someone wants to make a deal of some sort?

Very cool I'll check this out. In addition, Ultimate-Anonymity.com provides good services for cheap prices as well. They provide much of the same services, but it differs a bit. There's a one-time 29.95 fee, and they also do snail-mail remailing which has come in handy several times.
BTW, how would I go about port forwarding such that when a client tries to connect to port 9050 or 9030 on that ssh server, it redirects to those ports on my local box over here? I know the commands for getting my data to go in and out from this end, but I don't know how to do a "firewall-style" port forward via secure shell. Any help with this would be most appreciated, and if it works I'll certainly pass along the results and documentation to everyone.

Hash: SHA1
This may be a good idea to contemplate, Anthony. I know of many
successful action organizations, including some I've worked for/with
directly that had such set-ups. Does anyone here have legal knowledge
specific to this realm of affairs? I myself am not a trial lawyer, so
I don't know the pros/cons of this directly. On the other hand, I am
an expert on legal and non legal related privacy and asset protection
    If done correctly, one can conceal one's ownership of property
(finances, physical property like house/car, etc) and hide most
economic transactions from the Databases-of-Doom. Fellow ExitNode
operators should check out  and read
the "Asset Protection Crash Course".
    The bottom line here is that if the self-proclaimed "authorities"
can't find/don't know you own anything of value in the first place,
they're much less likely to seek you out as the next great "example"
to be held up and publically beaten to scare the public
(metaphorically speaking). It's worked for several years for me and
longer for many others, so covering your legal-financial ass is very
affordable insurance when standing up to the welfare/warfare/police state.
    Mr. Georgeo, I think we may have something here with the idea of a
two-pronged legal defense:
    A. On the front-end, a good regimen of "preventative care"
privacy/asset protection "best practices" should be encouraged amongst
Tor users, especially server/router owners. This will nip most
seizures and lawsuits in the bud before they start in most cases.
    B. For those rare exceptions when someone slips up and/or the men
with guns happen to get lucky through sheer statistics, we'll need a
way to fight back using the judicial system. I'm sure many of us are
already EFF members (I know I am at least), but going forward, the
EFF's legal burden may consist of Tor related lawsuits to a greater
extent. We already know that Germany and France have labeled operators
"Child Porn ringleaders" already, and something similar has happened
to a student at a US university relating to computer crime. As anyone
know pays attention to world politics knows, the US and all other
national governments have the bad habbit of picking up on their peers'
worst habbits. Anything to usurp more power... I mean spread democracy
and/or fight the war on terror/porn/[made up issue X], right?

This may very well be true in general. However, consider these two
important aspects:
1. Government=force, and if you can get away with shutting up your
opponents AND stealing most of or everything they have, why not? For
them, it kills two birds with one stone, and as we all know, it's
nearly impossible to get any of it back after the fact. This factor is
important not exclusively for Tor people, but for political critics in
2. More directly related to your analysis (which I believe is true as
a general principle), we must recall that in today's connected world,
the easiest way to get someone and take them down is to review their
many public and allegedly private records, such as bank transaction
information, utility bills, health forms (especially in more
socialized nation-states), etc. I don't pretend to argue that this
will instantly make you immune to the legal railroading that some
operators have experienced over the months, but it does make it quite
a bit more time consuming and expensive. After all, we're dealing with
incompetent, lazy bureaucrats here that would rather eat donuts than
bust people if it means having to do some actual work. They rely on
goading ISPs, banks, etc. into forking over information. This is an
even more acute risk in the US since the (un)PATRIOT Act passed.
Here's an example:
I have an 'invisible' LLC whose "principle place of business" is
registered as being in the Canary Islands. I organized it so that I
could get set up a wireless Internet account with a major US telcom. I
paid for it with an anonymous prepaid debit card. As a result, no one
knows where I live, nor do they have my SSN, as my LLC's EIN# was used
instead (also not connected to my personal info). You could use this
basic process for a variety of needs, but I used this one, as it's
germane to the basic problem at hand: "How can we help legally protect
Tor router operators?".

@_subject: A new public consumption tor article 
Hash: SHA1
I just put a new article about how/why someone like you should use
Tor. It's very basic, and not too technical. Here's an excerpt:
URL: Your personal browsing habbits, purchase history, and personal
preferences- perhaps even your name and contact information are
available on-line. In today's interconnected, data centric world, this
is not a surprise. If it relates to you, it's possible that a piece of
information is out there and available. But does it have to be this
way? The short answer is... No! Enter the Tor Anonymous Proxy ,
sponsored by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. This small, simple
client/server program will become your buddy, and you'll want to use
it when visiting controversial web sites, sending important e-mails,
or chatting on-line. Let's see how it works...
How Tor Works
On the official web site, Tor is described as:
"...a toolset for a wide range of organizations and people that want
to improve their safety and security on the Internet. Using Tor can
help you anonymize web browsing and publishing, instant messaging,
IRC, SSH, and other applications that use the TCP protocol. Tor also
provides a platform on which software developers can build new
applications with built-in anonymity, safety, and privacy features.
Tor aims to defend against traffic analysis, a form of network
surveillance that threatens personal anonymity and privacy,
confidential business activities and relationships, and state
security. Communications are bounced around a distributed network of
servers called onion routers, protecting you from websites that build
profiles of your interests, local eavesdroppers that read your data or
learn what sites you visit, and even the onion routers themselves."
Sounds good, right? Probably, but let me reiterate the above in plain
English everyone can understand. In a nutshell, Tor is simply a large
conglomeration of computers connected together via encrypted channels
over the Internet. As a result, it is very difficult for a spy
(government or private) to determine which computers are talking to
which, and how. Is Computer  really connecting to that web forum, or
is it simply doing so on behalf of any one of thousands of other
machines in the network? There's no easy way to tell. And it gets
better. The more people participate -either by starting a server or
simply using the client mode- the more anonymous Tor gets! Pretty
cool, huh?

Are you using any of the bandwidth controls? If so, that may be about
the time that your exit node runs out of bandwidth. Mine would only
take 3-4 hrs to run out of bandwidth, I guess because I'm in a high

are still blacklisted at cbl.abuseat.org.  I don't have the IPs handy
right now (they could be dynamic for all we know anyway), but if
you've got a mail server and/or allow common mail ports on your exit
node, please double check to make sure you're not in this blacklist
DB. This same thing happened to the MX at my univ, and it took over
two months for the blacklistings to fully go away!

    I do IT for a US public policy organization that won't be
mentioned right now. Very basically, we focus on the First Amendment
redress of/ /grievances thing, sort of like how Moveon.org does it.
Anyway, we are testing the possibility of using Tor to help prevent
being blacklisted by Congressional IT bureaucrats. In conjunction with
this, we'd like to encourage participants (at least donor
participants) to help out by running their own Tor exit nodes to
improve the anonymity and bandwidth capability of the network we've
all come to know and love. I'm all for doing this, but the question
is, how do we do this in a proper manner? My fear is that spreading
the word too much will get us in trouble eventually. Worst case
scenario would be that they blocked ALL known tor nodes, but I think
this is highly unlikely given my first hand experience of the poor
quality of government IT.
    That said, does anyone have experience with this kind of
situation? If so, what do you suggest?

in need of documentation that is also NOT programming side, which I
don't know much about? I also support the project financially already.
Perhaps I can get some of our members to do so as well.
We would be using Tor as a cover for a cluster of e-mail servers which
send constituent messages to Congress. Currently, we do this directly,
but we've had a few isolated "accidents" in the past that were not
explained, and seemed a bit like political censorship, though we can't
prove it due to the usual "plausible deniability" that politicians so
I agree that this whole thing may have negative consequences, but
would it be possible to configure Tor so that we had a separate node
network that was not connected to Tor, at least not as far as end
nodes go? This would shift and contain the blame to our participants
and not the entire community. Still, governments are famous for their
tendency toward collective punishment, so perhaps that wouldn't do
much anyway.
Is there any other solution?

gets eaten up over the first three hours or so of operation. I could
set the rate limits lower, but is there currently a way for Tor to
make inteligent decisions based on the average load? In other words,
in an ideal world, Tor would determine the average load, and normalize
it over the 24 hour AccountingMax period, giving the average rate as
the upper bandwidth rate during the day. This average would move a bit
over time, but always aim for AccountingMax over the course of the
average day.
Is this possible, and does it make sense to anyone?

final thing: It seems that iptables configs are lost when the computer
is shut down. Can I just add this to /etc/rc.d/rc.local, or should it be
initiated earlier in the boot sequence given that iptables is kernel

It seems to be gone now, at least for the time being. Others have had
this problem too though just fyi.

Has anyone else noticed the following bugs, specifically on Ubuntu 7.10?
A) When upgrading/installing/removing packages using apt, Tor tries to
initiate itself for no apparent reason, which results in a non-fatal but
very annoying error from apt that wastes buffer space, or requires
clicking a button if you're in X using Synaptec.
B) When a new tor release is let out of the cage, older directory auths
send a warning that you should use Now Obsolete Version X. To me, it
would seem more logical to have the warning be "my version or higher,"
not "my version or bust." Is there some technical or security related
reason for the current behavior?
Keep up the good work,
PS- Roger, I just saw your mention in the latest Linux Magazine.
Congrats on your latest 15 minutes of fame!

I'm also using the alphas, btw. As I said, this isn't critical, but it
is annoying as hell, and should be fixed when convenient. Not doing so
might drive away some new users who might assume the program is broken
or something.
