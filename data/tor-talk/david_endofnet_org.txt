It is a browser problem.
If I change the browser (even without using Tor) I have to do the same
process. So I think it is something based on cookies.

If you would not like to disable the /server-status you could use
something like:
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Authentication Required"
  AuthUserFile "/etc/htpasswd/.htpasswd"
  Require valid-user
  Order allow,deny
  Allow from all
and protect it with some really heavy user/password.

If you use linux on your node,
you could use tcptrack.
