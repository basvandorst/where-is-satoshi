Yelp is based in San Francisco. So is Pinterest. Getting the Wikimedia
Foundation (also based in San Francisco) to come over would be a huge
victory, IMO.

I'm downloaded the package at
official/torbrowser-install-3.0-alpha-1_en-US.exe on a Windows 7
64-bit laptop. I did not see any error messages on the install but
when I opened 'Start Tor Browser' nothing happened.

Mike Perry:
I have the Tor Browser Bundle installed on my Desktop. Running 'Start
Tor Browser' as Administrator and User has the same effect. The mouse
will indicate it is working in the background for a moment, and then no
window opens. It also does not matter if I unpack the file as
Administrator or User. Microsoft Security Essentials has not indicated
that it blocked anything. I wish I had the Windows 7 CD so I could
create a Windows 7 Virtual Machine, but I do not.
When I open 'Start Tor Browser' I notice a new process begins
WerFault.exe (Windows Problem Reporting) and then closes, but I don't
receive any error notification or message. I haven't had this problem
with any previous browser bundle.
