@_subject: [tor-talk] TorCitadel: Testers with RaspberryPi needed for torified 
I've created a Howto ( to run a decentralized network of home-made torified mail/jabber servers.
Instead of entrusting your mail some unknown hidden service mail operator you just run your own mail server on a Raspberry Pi at home/office. All TorCitadel mail/jabber servers use TOR as transport encryption. You can connect with any Jabber/IMAP/POP3 client to your Raspberry Pi based TorCitadel node.
Please test the Howto, extend and improve it.

I'am working on a HowTo for an end-to-end-encrypted email service ( It will receive mails via SMTP as a TOR hidden service. Unfortunately SMTP-clients do not support SOCKS for outgoing connections. I'd be glad for any input from you how to route outgoing SMTP connections into the TOR network.

Citadel is a groupware with integrated MTA, MDA, Jabber- and web-server which makes it very easy to configure for average joes. Setting up a TOR hidden service is no problem. TLS is not necessary as TOR already uses end-to-end encryption. The problem is to make Citadel sending outgoing SMTP/Jabber traffic to the TOR client.

I assume this relates to Elrippo's documentation. After my understanding all connections between a TOR-client and a TOR Hidden Service are end-to-end encrypted and authenticated via RSA-key->TOR Hidden Service My main problem is to route the SMTP-/Jabber-client traffic into the TOR network. It would be great to be able to distinguish between normal remote host domains and .onion, too.
But still the main goal is a very easy mail setup for average-joes with secure end-to-end encryption.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Current stable Raspbian packages 
the RaspberryPi is a great low-power platform for TOR Hidden Services like a personal mail server. Unfortunately the origin Debian/Raspbian packages are quite outdated and do not even support transparent Is there any chance the TorProject will provide current stable Raspbian

if OnionCat ist used, does the TOR Hidden Service name resolve/route to the OnionCat IPv6 address? Is it possible to reach a server process running on the OnionCat IPv6-address via the TOR Hidden Service

Great idea!
To avoid the dependency on servers/providers I suggest to take a Bitcoin-like blockchain with an extension to assign self-registered, globally unique pseudonyms to blockchain wallets and use the private ECDSA-key of the blockchain wallet corresponding to the pseudonym to sign X.509 certificates (e.g. S/MIME, object-code-signing, intermediate certificates for server applications like TLS, ...) which use the self-registered, globally unique pseudonym of the blockchain wallet as  already provides a blockchain with registration of pseudonyms (=identity). All you need to do is the following:
1. uses namecoind/Namecoin-QT to create a Namecoin blockchain wallet
2. uses namecoind/Namecoin-QT to register a pseudonym in Namecoin-blockchain (= identity)
3. uses some kind of application (e.g. HTML5 offline-app connecting to namecoind-/Namecoin-QT-RPC-API) which
    1. retrieves the private ECDSA-key key from the wallet
    2. calculates the public ECDSA-key to retrieve the matching identiy from the blockchain
    3. creates a x.509 certificate signed with the private ECDSA-key of the blockchain wallet (identity = CommonName)
    4. offers to save the x.509 certificate
    5. imports the x.509 certificate into the browser if applicable (e.g. for TLS client authorisation)
4. installs saved x.509 certificate into any other application used for 5. retrives Bob's public key from blockain
6. connects to Bob providing her own x.509 certificate and validating the x.509 certificate presented by Bob
1. same as Alice
2. same as Alice
3. same as Alice
4. same as Alice
5. accepts connection request from Alice
6. retrives Alice's public ECDSA-key from blockain and validates Alice's X.509 certificate
1. Tamper-proof publication of CommonName (=identity) <-> public 2. Alice's applications (E-Mail, TLS, ...) already support x.509 certificates, so nothing to patch
3. Bob's applications can be patched easily by adding libcoin-support or 1. Namecoin stores a lot of meta-data in blockchain -> traffic and storage overhead
2. monetary operations -> small costs of money
3. Namecoin identities are lost if not renewed within 36000 blocks (~ 5 I suggest to use the Namecoin blockchain as proof-of-concept and start a IETF workgroup for the real-world implementation.
