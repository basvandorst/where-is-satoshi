What's it take to convince Vidalia to talk to a Tor that the Vidalia didn't start, and to convince Tor to cooperate?  My interest here is in monitoring the bandwidth use by Tor.  I run Tor as a service on headless Ubuntu Debian Linux.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Connection / socket issues with Tor on Mac OS 
I have Linux rather than a Mac, but the example of my config files  might still help you.  No matter what your operating system is, you  have to point your browser at Polipo and Tor and you have to point  Polipo to Tor, in terms of addresses and port numbers.  What I know  about this is thanks to people responding in this list.
Here is how my Polipo config file differs from the default:
*** before/etc/polipo/config	2011-07-28 11:39:18.000000000 -0400

   # 'allowedClients' variable to the address of your network, e.g.

As for my browser, when I run it on the same machine that is running  Polipo and Tor (which wasn't my original intention, but I do that now  to distribute memory use across my computers), it has:
HTTP Proxy 127.0.0.1 port 8123
SSL  Proxy 127.0.0.1 port 8123
SOCKS Host 127.0.0.1 port 9050

No proxies for 127.0.0.1
So, as someone else on this list helpfully explained to me, you point  your browser directly to Tor for its SOCKS proxy but you point your  browser to Polipo for its HTTP proxy (and, I guessed, SSL proxy as

There's no way that would fly.  People who are willing to buy  advertising placements would not ever understand what Tor is and what  audience size they could expect.  Moreover, they would not want to  participate in a scheme to substitute their ads for ads by others.   They would have the feeling that the establishment would think of a  way to bite them back for anything that interferes with its normal  operation (advertising and brainwashing people).

What about user-IDs, ownerships, and permissions?  If it works when  you launch it one way but not another way, that's something that would  occur to me.  Maybe you are starting it as a user who/that doesn't  have access to the config file.

In re I think that's a good idea in general. Use one profile for work and  banking, stuff the government is going to know about anyway if they  want to.  Use a distinct profile for politics.  Cookies can carry all  sorts of interesting information back and forth, correlating your  activities and identity, otherwise.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Torbutton Tells Firefox to Ban Browsing to Port 8123 -- 
Even when Tor is disabled via Torbutton, Torbutton repeatedly changes Firefox settings in such a way that I can't browse to port 8123, which is the default port for Polipo.  I would really like to use the browser to see Polipo's manual, so this is to protest against this feature of Torbutton.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Request for Help Configuring Torbutton for Remote Polipo 
I want to run Polipo on a "server" machine and Firefox with Torbutton on distinct client machines not having Polipo or Tor loaded on them.  How do I set it up?
I tried it with Polipo listening on its default port of 8123.  I set Polipo's proxyAddress = "0.0.0.0" so it would listen to requests  I set its allowedClients = 127.0.0.1, 192.168.2.0/24 since my client machine is in the latter network.  These settings sufficed to allow me to brows to Polipo's manual from the client machine (before I loaded TorButton).
So with TorButton I tried configuring its SOCKS, http, and SSL proxy settings to point to the server machine and port 8123, but its test failed.  So what is the right way to set it up, and please explain the underlying logic.
Thanks in advance.
