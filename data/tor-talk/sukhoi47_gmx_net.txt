@_subject: [tor-talk] Kaspersky still interferes with SSL port 443 sites 
Your information is precious.
I am experimenting problems with TorBrowser on the last months.
On most of the web sites I have to reload it 2 to 8 times until it loads, receiving most of the times messages like this:
I updated TorBrowser several times in a hope to fix the problem, but without success.
Now, with your information, I turned off Kaspersky Pure 3.0 and the problem just gone.
Seems  the problem is just with, or at least more frequent, with https connections, and I see a small probability that HTTPS Everywhere may be playing a role on the problem.
Hope this is not a NSA attempt to track Tor users by using some built-in functionality on Kaspersky.

Thanks for the comments.
I did additional tests and possibly you are right about the Kaspersky and AV.
I just installed the latest Tor 2.4.x beta version, on Win 8 x64. The problem seems to be a bit smaller, but stands, having to load and reload the pages many times to get the content.
Tried also Tor 2.3 stable release on Linux, were the problem did not

@_subject: [tor-talk] Can Google location system track TOR users? 
I am surprised how google maps was able to track my location, with few meters of error, by using the "Share Location" feature.
It is not clear how they are tracking the location with such accuracy. For sure is not using the IP.
I guess they are crossing the information about the SSID wireless networks available near-by my location, which physical location was collected by google street view, with the wireless networks SSID my computer is able to "see". My own internet wireless connection is very new and was not installed when google street view did the survey on my city, so they must to be using the networks near-by. Maybe they are using the wireless signal intensity to triangulate my position, improving the accuracy.
I did some tests. The tracking location was very accurate on Firefox 25, with an error of few meters, but Firefox 16 was able to identify just my city, with an error over 20 Kilometers. This means that the tracking is a feature built-in the browser, probably submitting the required information to the google geo-location servers, and is able to by-pass tricks like set VPN to mask the IP.
I guess the tracking system is submitting to google servers other information as well, as the MAC address, that may be used to identify the user across different location and internet access points.
Firefox is developed by Mozilla. Google "donates" 90% of the Mozilla Foundation funds. Who pays is the patron and give the orders. Google's core business is track people and sell the information to governments.
Is there any chance to have in Firefox a "hidden" tracking that may compromise TOR?

No. I did everything using my notebook and no GPS was connected to it.
Possibly they use GPS too, on devices with this functionality, but was not my case.

A wi-fi position system was built! Oh, so terrible.
It time and viable to include on TOR a mechanism, or companion software, to generate fake wi-fi networks near-by the user, but using real wi-fi SSID existing on other places, creating confusion to the wi-fi position system, making harder to identify the user location using this technique?

@_subject: [tor-talk] NoScript for TOR disabled by default 
I am talking about tracking by google and other sites to identify the user physical location.
Bug is an issue, as always, but now the browsers have a native and specifically designed funcionality to track the location by looking the wireless networks the user's computer can "see".
The functionality is to help users that "do not know where they are". Yes, yes, and I believe also in Santa Clauss...
Firefox has that functionality and this is not a coincidence. 90% of Firefox Foundation funds are by Google.
Google core business is steal data to sell to governments and anybody else that can pay.
Since the beginning Google has been funded by In-Q-Tel, a CIA arm.
Regardless of anything else, if the intention is good or not, that tracking functionality has the potential to by-pass the TOR techniques to hide the user identity. TOR developer team is doing a great job and, IMHO, fix that issue will corroborate to keep the TOR's value and purpose for the community.
Another big threat that SSL, AES and other encryption protocols used by TOR network probably are compromised by NSA:

@_subject: [tor-talk] no more Vidalia for TOR, what if... 
Many TOR exit nodes were banned to access some sites. One way to by-pass this is taking a "new identity" to change tor exit node.
But now, the latest TOR browser version has no more the Vidalia client. So, how to change the exit node?

The NoScript addon is a powerful way to improve privacy, but version after version, by default it comes DISABLED!
Is there any possibility to release the next TOR versions with NoScript I think this will be helpful, especially for new TOR users.

Thanks for the link. I can understand the reason to keep noscript enabled by default, but most of the users are not aware about the risks associated with javascript and even many experts underestimate it; most of the tracking/spying tools are javascript based.
I can understand the intention on not frustrate many users, but is not TOR a tool intended to, primarily, provide security and anonymity, instead convenience?

Thanks for your comment.
In fact, I am worried with the Wireless Position System developed by google and others, and the introduction in the browsers, like firefox, a way to track which wireless networks the computer can "see" in a given moment. Based on that they identify the user physical (because google street view mapped the wireless network physical location), fingerprint the computer and, possibly, track other key information.
Seems that this critical issue is not currently handled by TOR.
