@_subject: email servers and tor? 
is it possible to run an email server completely through tor? of course pop3/imap/smtp clients could connect through tor, but what of making service itself run through it and maybe accessed through a hidden service?
i guess with an .onion address an email could not be delivered to non-tor services? maybe i misunderstand something!

hello friends!
the great software adium for mac seems to work great with tor except for the polish gg service because it uses its own library that does not respect the proxy settings of adium. does anyone know how this can be fix so that gg also can run over tor?

i am looking for a solution for mac using tor and little snitch:
when I have the global proxy configured to make everything run through tor, the mac ignores little snitch rules!
how can I configure the app to respect little snitch rules and at the same time move through tor?

i have an idea- i would like an app for easily controlling what gui and non-gui apps are using tor, like with little snitch on the mac. maybe i can try to make this? what would be the best way to do this?
in the best case it should detect like little snitch if an app that is to be proxied is opening and automatically route it the proper way, yes? i can program a little. is there some list member who can help to outline the basic idea?
thank you!

i was just reading about hardware DRM with intel chips and it look very bad for the future.
since big company like cisco sell out to governments around the world, why not intel also?
can these chips be used to spying and identifying people based on network data stream? who is doing research?
sorry if this is too OT...

when building webserver I want only 127.0.0.1 able to connect - not the internet and not 192.168.x.x even! this is for hidden service _ONLY_ and no one even on local network should be able to probe for it.
i know how to setup hidden service basically. how can i do this above with apache or lighttpd? if i want the same for ssh how can I do it using system?
restrict all connections to 127.0.0.1 - and no tails please!  :-D

@_subject: [tor-talk] How close to really secure Android phone with Tor and 
I want to make Android purchase in next year, to abandon iPhone and use phone securely. There are some questions:
** Does this ORBot really can route _ALL_ phone data traffic through Tor?
** Does ORBot also push tethered connection through own Tor?
** Does ORBot destroy battery life badly?
** Is there yet working full-disk encryption solution for Android?
** Is there yet "transparent" crypto-call solution for Android?
** Is everything some disaster if I try to update firmware (CyanogenMod?) :-)
About transparent encrypted call:
I would like to make call with normal phone app, and make some detection of encrypted support, with automatic switching to crypto-call if working. This is how some Mac app like Adium work with OTR. It seems possible, some short sound modulated-audio "handshake" at start?
Is this ideas reality or dream? :-)

This seem like Tor for secret delivery of a real object!
"Delivery of products bought online can violate consumers' privacy, although not in a straightforward way. In particular, delivery companies that have contracted with a website know the company selling the product, as well as the name and address of the online customer. To make matters worse, if the same delivery company has contracted with many websites, aggregated information per address may be used to profile customers' transaction activities. In this paper, we present a fair delivery service system with guaranteed customer anonymity and merchant-customer unlinkability, with reasonable assumptions about the threat model."
