@_subject: Mapping the physical locations of Tor nodes 
Any thoughts as to why these two maps are different?  socialistsushi has
far more nodes in asia, in particular china than the freehaven map.  The
sort by city choice on socialistsuchi also lists beijing as the city
with the most routers.  Is socialistsushi cumulative over time or a snapshot of the current
consensus at the time the script runs?

gmail has an option to force ssl, not sure if they'll honor an in-stream
request to disable ssl when it conflicts with your personal preference.

If in the United States,
pertains to you.
No more than there is a case for the non-Tor Internet.  Tor transports
packets, what people use it for isn't up to you.  Interesting that
you're trying to assign morality to a protocol.

Under Section 230 of the CDA, Tor should be protected as a provider of
an interactive computer service.  As there hasn't been a court case,
that I know of, this is unproven at this point.  There is plenty of
precedent to support this conclusion, however.
: I would rather know the truth and be able to make a decision about what I
: want to support than be blind sided by cops randomly showing up at my house
: claiming I did something bad and taking all my stuff.
: : Recall the gentlemen from Germany that went through a huge amount of
: bullshit because someone abused his node.
: I don't want to be that guy.
And this is the classic "chilling effect".  If you don't want Tor to
exist in the world, harass those that do by arrest and confiscation.  I
believe in the incidents in Germany, every node operator was found not
guilty and in most cases, their computers were returned.  If you personally don't want to fight for online anonymity, that's fine.
I hope you won't discourage those that do.

@_subject: FYI: ultimate security proxy with tor 
: 1. 8 tor processes, each using separate spool directory
: 2. 8 privoxy processes, each configured to talk to separate tor.
Why 8?  Why not 1? 2? 16?
: 3. First squid, with malware domains blacklist, will have 8 round robin cache peers configured. (squid-in)
Using blacklists seems like a recipe for disaster.  Much like the
various lists floating around of suspect tor nodes, I suspect these
blacklists are based on very little research and more on "I
heard my 3rd cousin once received a virus from some site that looked
like this".  I could be wrong.
: 4. Havp, with squid-in as parent. (Anti-virus proxy, using clamav :) )
: 5. Second squid, that will use havp as parent (squid-out). Users will connect to this one.
Why the double proxy?  And does this open up a new threat for shared
users on the system to see when/how someone downloaded something through
this setup based on how long it takes to retrieve an object?

tor performance is circuit dependent.  roughly every 10 minutes your circuits
should change.

does normal firefox with torbutton work?
: 4) The behaviour of torbutton is still erratic. Pages loaded return
: with the message "torbutton blocked java.. using save-as"  while the

Likely, these are different circuits and exit relays.  Perhaps you've
found an exit trying to inject java into a page, or perhaps something is
configured incorrectly.
