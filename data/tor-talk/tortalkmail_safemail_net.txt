@_subject: [tor-talk] Anonymous really de-anonymise Tor users!? 
More froms me about Anonymous. Looks to Tor was broken and users info posted and found from Tor with IP and home addess in cases of lots. Please tell me what this is and mean. I say good for to arrest phedos but scary if Anonymous breaks Tor.
this read for info:
" Official Release - 10/15/2011
After hours of researching the users dump from Lolita City, we have found documents and identified many of the users.
If the FBI, Interpol, or other law enforcement agency should happen to come across this list, please use it to investigate and bring justice to the people listed here."
Opdarknet's Pastebin
read now for see how Anonymous attack HIdden Wiki and L*city:
"As promised here is the entire user database of the 1589 users active on Lolita City, an darknet trading site for pedos.
While we were not able to obtain the password credentials (they use an SHA512 hash separate database to secure their passwords), but we were able to determine the following info of the server 1) Using timing attacks with our Beowulf clusters located in Europe, Asia, the US, and South Africa.  we
were able to determine an estimate TTL of the server's location roughly in the USA.
2) The NGNIX server hosting the content is on a shared server (we used select+benchmark SQLi to determine the MySQL performance) and did it hold up after 10,000 packets.
3) The server was using hardened PHP with escaping.  We were able to bypass it with with UTF-16 ASCII encoding
We are suspending our attack on The Hidden Wiki, as we currently ran out AT&T prepaid bandwidth for our NetBSD toaster.  The "Nyan Nyan" NetBSD toaster had to be put to death to with Thermite, Burning Man Fashion."

@_subject: [tor-talk] Anonymous de-anonymise Tor user (update no's) 
I see that infos about how Anonymous found IP addres and home locations of somes phedos:
"We then started to put together a sting operation.  After analyzing the list of Lolita City users, we were able to identify 13 of them.  Also we set off 'Chris Hanson' to start uploading episodes of To Catch a Predator onto Lolita City disguised as "CP" or "Catch Pedophiles".  that URL has the infos and has more info about attacks

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fwd: Anonymous to attacks Hidden Wiki and others hidden 
Read here for Anonymous to explain attacks and post username of pedofiles from some HS called L*city
" - Lolita City user dump"  I say good for thems to attack
phedo, but bad for Tor people to attack all of Hidden Wiki. Please Tor people, tell me what they do, I find interested in attack on Tor. Do Anonymous attack Tor or HS themselves? Timing attack was written
to, to find servers in US, etc. Sorry for my English is bad.
Do this do well for Tor? To show weakness to be fix? Down with phedo,  so good that Anonymous attack
and i hope this good for Tor general for attack testing in actual world. What I think I read is DDOS
attack on Freedom Hosting and L*city. Is not HS meaning to stop DDOS attack?
