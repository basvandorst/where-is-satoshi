Why not helping the official forum[0] grow instead of creating new ones?

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy question 
We strongly recommend using TBB. And since we're going to dump Vidalia
soon, maybe it's not a good idea to go that way.
If you want to run a relay (which is awesome!), I suggest you use a
linux machine like debian for that.
the problem
"Custom setting" is the only way right now. TorBirdy is under
development and in early beta stages. New updates are coming soon
though. Stay tuned and file a bug if you've found something went wrong.

And you've to trust those VPN providers to stay true to their words
and keep their promises for not keeping *any* log. And then... you've
to pray they wouldn't get tapped, keep their traffic secure, etc etc.
Privacy by design vs privacy by promise

@_subject: [tor-talk] Request for "Tor, king of anonymity" graphic 
I was doing some graphic work today, got bored and thought I'd give this
a try.
here it is: They're all in vector. Let me know if you needed some other format.
I personally like the bottom-right one better :P

@_subject: [tor-talk] Stack Exchange Q&A Commitment Phase 
As most of you already know we are at our early stage of having a Q&A
site on Stack Exchange. I'd like to let you know that we've stepped-up
to "Commitment phase" today[1].
I thought I'd suggest you to:
1- Use this link[1] and click on "commit" button, if you haven't
already. You don't really need to do anything else at this stage. This
basically shows the community that this site is needed and there'll be
ppl to follow and commit to it.
2- Spread the word. More people know about this, the better it works.
If you have a blog or a social media account like Twitter, Facebook,
etc. I'd suggest a post like this[2] on your timeline.
or simply forward this message to any other related mailing lists or
whoever you want to.
[2]: Thank you!
All the bests,

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy 0.1.2 released - Our third beta release! 
It's complete in fact.
IIRC, (according to sukhe), there's an string on Transifex which is
actually not included in TorBirdy anymore.
But there's a bigger problem which I only learned couple weeks ago.
There's no Persian (Fa) Thunderbird. So that's no use, even if we have
Persian TorBirdy included.
All the bests,
