Thank you for your reply Mike!
Yes you are correct. Search is done with JavaScript (client side) and the entire index is sent to the browser initially. There will be no search logs.
JavaScript search is now faster and does not block the user interface. This is done now by waiting 1000ms from the very last keyup event before laughing the search. Since the web worker cannot access the DOM we decided to implement that this way for now. At least it works now HTTPS it is now ( Furthermore, we have removed all Google's code and every resource is now downloaded from ahmia.fi - even those twitter news.
Thank you very much for your answer! We are always ready to do these kind of improvements to our site.

We are working on Tor related projects including running Tor exit nodes and the first public Tor hidden service search engine We would love to hear opinions and ideas about ahmia.fi search. There are now few enthusiastic geeks using their own money and free time to this project and everyone is welcome to join.
Our goals are:
- consciousness raising: public work and news
- raise the accessibility of Tor by public access to the content
- share information about the Tor Project
- help people to find hidden services' content
- help people to rate and comment the content
- help the hidden service operators to provide official descriptions used in search (
To do this, we would like to provide a nice search engine service with some social aspects (commenting/rating), publish news and challenge people and organisations to donate their bandwidth by running nodes. Also, we will provide public APIs and hidden service data for We are already providing public cache and simple search engine to Tor hidden services: Furthermore, we are running two very fast exit nodes   (ahmiaTORProxy01) and  We are planning some possible next steps:
1) Full text search according to the cache
2) Better support to comments and ratings
3) Authenticated hidden service descriptions provided by the hidden service operator themselves
You can find us on IRC, in the channel  in the OFTC network. We would be happy to hear any and all suggestions or ideas from you!
We are looking forward to hearing you!
