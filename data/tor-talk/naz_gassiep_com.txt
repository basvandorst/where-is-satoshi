However, yes I agree that private browsing should default to read-only, as any time you interact, you expose something of yourself, whether by what you're responding to, how you write, or what view or opinion you are expressing. Tor users need to be aware that any interaction while in privacy mode is a liability, and it is proper that they have to actively enable some option to enable interaction.

Not true. I was able to do it by drowning a few kittens in my toilet.

Well, how about you say something a little less loaded than "the malicious uses for Tor are ...".
Say something like "Tor is a tool, and like all tools it can be used with good and bad intentions. Some examples of good uses are a, b, and c, while examples of malicious uses are d, e, and f." Then you have a wide range of very interesting discussions that can be engaged in, such as exploring methods that society can use to determine the merit of encouraging or discouraging things that result in both good and bad outcomes. Where are the thresholds? What metrics would you use to determine "goodness" and "badness"? Why does Naz not have a bowl ice cream on his desk right now? You know, important issues like that.
Please note my use of the Oxford Comma, it is the most important part of what I said.

I am not front Turkey, but I have MANY Turkish friends and am married to a Turkish girl. I would be able and willing to find someone interested in these topics that would be happy to discuss this with you.
Feel free to contact me off-list.

As I understand, this is not really a good idea for a couple of reasons:
1. If it takes off, then it places a large amount of Tor's capacity in the hands of one organization (Amazon), which is a not so good idea because that's the prime vector by which Tor can be attacked: control of a statistically significant number of nodes.
2. Amazon EC2 instances cannot inherently be trusted, as the encryption will all happen on potentially hostile hardware adding to the risk profile of this project. If Amazon found themselves with a NSL, they could be conceivably, coerced into monitoring the machine states.
I would recommend establishing a script for apt and yum based distros that can be quickly deployed on any VPS hosted by any provider.
