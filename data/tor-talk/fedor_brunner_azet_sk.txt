Hash: SHA512
The TOR Hidden service uses 1024-bit long-term RSA key.
According to this document it appears possible to break a 1024-bit RSA
key in one year using a device whose cost is about $10M
According to "FactHacks: RSA factorization in the real world" any
1024-bit key can be factored in 2^80 operations by NFS (number-
Feasible today for botnets and for large organizations.
Will become feasible for more attackers as chips become cheaper.
Is is possible to replace the 1024-bit RSA key in Hidden Services with
a longer key? Or is it possible to replace it with Ed25519 ?

Orbot: Tor for Android
allows to create hidden services on Android phones. How much anonymous
do you think these hidden services are? Phones usually connect many
times to different Wifi networks and back to mobile networks.
"If your computer isn't online all the time, your hidden service won't
be either. This leaks information to an observant adversary."
