I would agree with the bandwidth issue, as many people find the Tor
network slow as it is already. I would recommend adding an i2p router
if people want to torrent. I2P doesn't seem to have a problem with it,
and has a torrent client packaged in by default, as well as a
respectable library to torrent from that is continuing to grow.

@_subject: [tor-talk] VPS Suggestions for Middle Relay 
Hey everyone,
I've been searching around for a few hours now looking for a good VPS
service to host a non-exit relay. It seems as if most VPS services
cringe at the word Tor, and the ones that allow it are either slightly
sketchy looking or somewhat expensive.
In fact, I had one service tell me that the relay would HAVE to be exit,
otherwise they wouldn't be able to monitor the network for malicious
use. Another service just told me that they already have 2-4 relays per
node as is, so it would be pointless (although I feel this may just be
an effort to reduce their bandwidth load).
So I'm looking to spend around $20-$30 dollars a month, and was
wondering if this awesome list had any recommendations?
Online.net has some very cheap unmetered dedicated servers, and I hear
that they're currently changing their policy to allow middle relays, but
I've also heard that they have been terrible in the past with shutting
down relays. Anyone have any comments on this?
PS: I did find the GoodBadISP list, but some of the information seems
out of date.

The way that we know that Tor is relatively safe is that it is open
source and transparent. The government isn't monolithic. There are
different branches of government that have different interests. It is in
the interest of certain branches of US government to have a diverse,
secure, and anonymous system so that their own people can use it without
being known government operatives. Also, if there were any backdoors
we'd probably know by now. The code is not secret, nor are the finances.
The Tor Project is incredibly open and transparent about almost
everything that happens.
     Furthermore, the NSA doesn't need to own half the relays to
de-anonymize someone. If you're targeted, then Tor just buys you some
time. Tor is extremely secure against drag-net surveillance, but
targeted attacks from a government entity are a little more difficult to
defend against.
     If you are worried that there aren't enough Tor relays then I'd
encourage you to start one.

Not exactly what was originally requested, but I thought it might be
funny nonetheless:
