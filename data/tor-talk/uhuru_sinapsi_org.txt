@_subject: So TOR is NOT  really anonoymous!? 
I set up TOR (the onion router) and privoxy hoping to browse anonymously,
I am using Mozilla Firefox 1.0.6 and if I visit other site such as:
TOR works properly.
BUT if I check here:
they show my REAL IP  address!
So TOR is NOT  really anonoymous!?
later on I discovered by myself that if I disable java in Firefox
settings then even
cannot read my Real IP address.
So I have to keep java always turned off?
