Some of these people were probably being watched a long time before any of this happened. Phones were probably tapped and homes bugged. There's more ways to find out about a hidden service than attacking Tor.
A lot of good people rely on Tor. Hopefully this wasn't totally the result of a Tor network attack. -------- Original Message --------

Usually you won't go through the trouble of using Tor unless your privacy is being attacked. Once you start using Tor it's easier to justify surveillance because of Tor's reputation. Now after all that you have to figure out how to be anonymous while doing business. We haven't mentioned how to avoid phone tapping, hidden microphones, and people following you in the streets. Tor is a very small piece to the privacy/anonymity puzzle.
Complete anonymity and privacy is possible, even in the face of advanced surveillance operations. If we make protecting good people our priority, instead of fighting evil to the point that it hurts the good, this would be much easier to achieve. I think the Tor community need to recognize themselves and help each other more, regardless of how criminals will take advantage. This is a real challenge for all of us, but there's an extreme injustice occurring that's a serious threat to all of us. Jim Smith
