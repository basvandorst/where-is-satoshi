@_subject: Strange log warnings 
Hi everyone,
first post on tor talk, hope this is also the right place where to get
I've been running a server for almost 3 days now and everything works
fine, except fot theese log messages:
Aug 02 11:50:50.255 [warn] rend_mid_introduce(): No intro circ found for
INTRODUCE1 cell ([scrub bed]) from circuit 40951; responding with nack Aug 02 14:52:02.527 [warn] circuit_receive_relay_cell(): Didn't
recognize cell, but circ stops h ere! Closing circ. Aug 02 14:52:02.553 [warn] command_process_relay_cell():
circuit_receive_relay_cell (forward) fa iled. Closing.
The server is open, but since the machine is offering many other
services i can't open ports, so i had to set ExitPolicy reject *:*
in torrc.
Whgat are the messages?
should i worry?

thanks for the file, very funny but:
did this happen only in my version - both streamed and downloaded - or
in the beginning there really is a voice saying - very jumpy and with
corrupted video - "in cyberspace everyone can hear your scream" ?

@_subject: New Tor middleman server woes 
Hi everyone,
after a lot of time i had the stable connection back and i decided to
set up my tor middleman server once again.
I successfully configured and installed the latest tor version - from
debian experimental - but i fear i have the old server still registered
with the tor list of servers...
Is there a way i can have the old server deleted - i erased the old
fingerprint - and/or substituted with the new one i just set up to
avoid getting this error
Oct 14 23:05:30.856 [warn] http status 400 ("Rejected: There is already
a named server with this nickname and a different fingerprint.")
response from dirserver '8 6.59.21.38:80'. Please correct. Oct 14 23:05:31.210 [warn] http status 400 ("Rejected: There is already
a named server with this nickname and a different fingerprint.")
response from dirserver '1 28.31.0.34:9031'. Please correct. Oct 14 23:05:31.250 [warn] http status 400 ("Rejected: There is already
a named server with this nickname and a different fingerprint.")
response from dirserver '1 28.31.0.34:9032'. Please correct. in the logs? (i am actually running the server on port 9001, i don't
know if that matters)
