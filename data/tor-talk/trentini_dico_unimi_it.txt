@_subject: two experiments I've done with relays, feedback welcome :) 
Hi, I'm experimenting two relay setups that might be interesting
(the first one more than the second), I'd like to receive comments
if you have time...
1) Tunneled TOR
Wiki page description
(very draft, but the concept should be clear)
2) Portable TOR
Wiki page description
(alas, this one has "saw wave" performance because the process gets
periodically killed by my vps provider)
Thank you for your attention

I've edited my wikipage, I'd appreciate some feedback :)
And I'd like to see if that setup is easily reproducible...
Thank you

What do you mean?
I was aware of that but I'd prefer something more complete and
persistent, tor-ramdisk seems too cropped down...
Anyway, I said that the first experiment was far more
interesting than this one ;)
