Hi Niklas,
a german ADSL 6000 line has a bandwith of 6000 Kbit/s downstream
(towards you) and only 512 Kbit/s upstream (from you to the
internet). 512 Kbit are 64 Kbyte, so if you can upload 60 Kb it's
perfectly fine. Of course this is only interessting if you act as a
node in the Tor network. If you use Tor only as a client, the
upstream is not a limit. Tor is a censorship-resistant anonymity
network. Despite huge efforts towards more of it, speed is not the
priority of the Tor network. A download of around 64 KByte/s through
Tor isn't that bad, depending on your current route through the
network it can nearly everywhere between 0.01 KByte and your line
limit (~750 KByte/s).
If you have any further questions you can contact me. Because this
list is english, I've answered in english, but we can also discuss
this in german if you would like.
