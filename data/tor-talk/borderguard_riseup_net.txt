@_subject: [tor-talk] Unable to launch amazon TOR cloud instances 
While I was managing my Amazon account I was doing some routine
terminations of bridges in preparation to launch fresh instances from the
 website. Now for some reason whenever on
click on any of the public bridges buttons, for some reason it will not
load the AMI local to any of the regions. I also cannot locate the
instances manually.
Did Amazon yank the pre-built instances, or am I just having issues?
Your friend, Borderguard.

CenturyLink's ToS prohibits the use of services such as TOR exit nodes on
residential connections. You may want to focus of running a relay instead
of a exit node. They can (and will) disconnect you permanently for repeat
violations. It's because the ISP can detect the signature of the traffic
the virus Zeus leaves and shut down the connection. Since it's a FBI
flagged virus that was mutated starting around may 2011 and because
CenturyLink has had issues where about 300 emails were suspended for SPAM
violations in the past month, they will not allow infected machines on
their network.
Additionally, it might not be you, but someone who's machine is infected,
or using your node as a exit point for the Command and control server
hiding behind it.

Where are some good places to advertise tor bridges?

@_subject: [tor-talk] TOR bridge mailing list 
Since I was not able to find a place to share tor bridges, I created a
place... or rather a mailing list:
If you or people you know are interested in obtaining bridges or
disseminating them, this would be a good list to be on. The idea is that
people would set up bridges, and send the ip, port and print to this list,
and every week I would send out a limited list of what has been collected.

If you yourself signed up for this list, you would need to do so.

I could care less. Don't want to tell people that its a obfsproxy. Strange
though we have not deployed a cloud version of it yet [obfsproxy].
