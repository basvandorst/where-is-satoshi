um.. I just tried going to  & got the
Privoxy blocked See why
page back.
If the only browser you use is Firefox, maybe it might be better doing
everything inside the browser (although I've had problems with torbutton and
noscript breaking things).  But I use 3 different browsers; one of which is IE
and I don't think you can do much of any blocking/filtering there.

@_subject: Problem logging out of yahoo mail over Tor 
Try adding these lines to your Privoxy default.action file - one of
them should fix your problem.
  ===== begin ======
{ -crunch-all-cookies -filter -fast-redirects -hide-referer
-kill-popups -prevent-compression }
{+fast-redirects{check-decoded-url} -block}
  ===== end ======
I don't remember ever having a problem logging out of Yahoo using a browser with javascript disabled.  I did have a problem using Firefox
with everything enabled...  I think it was the  .yahoo.com/.*done=http
that fixed the logout problem - but I'm not sure so I included all of
my privoxy rules for yahoo.

TOR questions should be directed to the onion router mailing list - I've added
them to the cc: list
grc.com is good enough to tell if you've got things configured correctly, but
it isn't a very good test site.  I just tried it & they didn't display my real
IP adddress.  A better test site is
  that one can find my real IP
address if I leave enough plugins enabled.
Are you sure that you've got Firefox configured correctly?  Click on
Tools/Options and then Advanced/Network/Settings.  Make sure "Manual Proxy
Configuration" is selected.  Enter 127.0.0.1 port 8118 for the http host & port
and make sure that "Use this proxy server for all protocols" is checked.
Are you sure that you've got Privoxy configured correctly?  Somewhere in the
main config file you need to have a line like this
  forward-socks4a  /  127.0.0.1:9050  .
to tell Privoxy to forward all traffic to TOR
I think your browser and/or privoxy is not configured correctly.  Once you
straighten out the configuration issues then you get to deal with the problem
of plug-ins leaking info.  I don't know where the Tor group is with that.. but
it seems like the only resolution is to disable all plugins.  I've been reading
things about running your browser session inside a virtual machine that sends
all of the network traffic through Tor but I don't if or how well that works.
Hope this helps..
