Hi again,
I recorded some raw and extremely verbose tcpdump data while visiting
ftp.debian.org using version 1.35 of Dooble. I'm unable to locate any
mention of the visit in the log. I also visited ftp.netbsd.org as I may
have some cached DNS queries. My browsing FTP settings are:
219.111.10.220:8080, socks5. Version 1.35 doesn't use QFtp. As for other
leaked information, did you have the "Display the IP..." option
(Settings->Security) enabled while interrogating the system?

Do you mind testing a beta release of 1.35 with respect to this issue?

Randolph has good intentions, although his approaches require
refinement. I've asked him several times to discontinue promoting Dooble to
the Tor community. I'm responsible for Dooble, but I can't control its
existence beyond Sourceforge. The official site for Dooble and its Wiki
entry (as of right now) do not mention Tor.
As for leaking IP information, we work with a framework (Qt) that has
issues and limitations. Every release of Dooble includes detailed
information covering all of the fixes and improvements.

My turn.
You're insinuating that some dark conspiracy is at work with Dooble. Dooble
isn't a scam. It's a Web browser with real users, real feedback, and real
goals. It's one thing when you harass other projects that intend to use or
misuse it (or misrepresent it) and another when you're attacking something
you don't understand. Dooble doesn't profit from any advertisements or
special interests. I don't have some suits directing me and I don't live in
some hive either. Your belligerent attitude is mundane and pointless. You
ought to properly address your complaints and anger to the
torbrowser.sf.netproject. As I've written on another Tor mailing list,
Dooble doesn't
require Tor's blessing. Dooble is free software that is continuously
improving. Have some manners. I don't care if it's unfit for Tor. I didn't
design and implement Dooble for Tor. Again, contact the respective project
and offer constructive criticisms.

Uploaded. Please remove $HOME/.dooble before using 1.35. Please also verify
that Settings->Security->Display... is disabled.
I tested 1.35 with respect to DNS queries alongside Wireshark (I removed
DNS filters). The results were positive for both HTTP and FTP, that is,
Wireshark didn't detect DNS packets. I then tested version 1.31 with
respect to FTP and Wireshark discovered several DNS packets. (I did not
test HTTP.) All of the tests were conducted using a socks5 proxy (
