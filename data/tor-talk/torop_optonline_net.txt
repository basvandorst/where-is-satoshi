No, I'm only running one node, and the name has always been Zippy.
I am running on a part-time basis, about 14 hours a day, but that's the way I've always run it.

@_subject: Problem with Tor 
I started up my Tor node just now and  noticed some strange behavior. First, the node CPU utilization went to and stayed at 100%. Second, the bandwidth graph lines moved so fast that I could barely see them go by. I'm running the latest 2.0.21 version and made no changes to anything since it was running fine yesterday. I also noticed that the time on the bandwidth graph was one hour ahead of the actual time although the machine had the correct time. Maybe it has to do with the daylight savings that kicked in today?

I've run various servers for years on my Cablevision/Optimum account
without any problems or complaints whatsoever.
They do block ports 25 and 80 on the basic account level, however the
next level eliminates that and you get 30Mbps down and 5Mbps up with it.

I am having the same problem. When I put my nickname in EntryNodes, Tor starts fine, but when I add StrictEntryNodes 1 I get this same error. I tried putting in my IP instead of my nickname, but Tor then says that using an IP is not yet supported, using 0.2.1.20.

On my Tor network map, every relay has a ? next to it instead of the country icon.
Is this a bug or is there a file I can remove to get it to show properly?

@_subject: Bug? 
Tor has been up and running fine for ~8 hours now, both as client and server. I've also noticed this behavior when running Tor as a client only on a different computer, although that one shows ~10% of the countries. This seems to have started when I went to the 2.1.19 release, but I'm not 100% sure about that. And yes, I have noticed the occasional connection to port 443.
