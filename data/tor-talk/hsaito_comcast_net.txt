@_subject: BitTorrent - can it be blocked? 
I thinkTor's aim is clearly written in
The reality is that it is not very clear cut. I do agree about your router analogy, but the reality is there's not enough legal precedences of who should be blamed especially when anonymous system is utilized.
Is claiming that you were running Tor server sufficient? I don't know, our laws obviously haven't kept up with reality.
Isn't that just like asking "I can cut orange with this knife, but isn't it also aimed to stab people?"

@_subject: hidden services... 
It is simply, because your copy of Tor, presumably running on your machine is accessing Apache server that running on the same computer.
Tor (Someone's computer)  <--> node <--> node....node <--> node <--> Tor (on your computer) <--> Apache (on your computer)

@_subject: Very useful feature not being talked about a lot... 
Maybe one of the capability quite overlooked in the Tor is its ability to
offer hidden service behind NAT.
I have one webserver running behind my wireless router, not a single poking
on the port, it works great :-)
Just thought it's not mentioned much in places...
I think it's one of greatest feature -- enabling people who wouldn't
other-wise able to offer service out of the network can do it...(and
probably ISP won't notice that you are doing it either!)

@_subject: Compiling my own version? 
I got some questions...
I write Japanese Tor information page,
 and as a part of the page, I have
my own compiled version (that usually compiled within a day after any
dev-build is published), which I believe is pretty much same thing offered
in official Tor page, maybe different compiler version. (but in case of
critical bugs, CVS code is incorporated as case-by-case basis with some
amount of testing, such as that Win32 crash bug I was looking at other day.)
I'm guessing license-wise, it is okay to distribute the code, but are there
any identifier I should put in the version?
For example, GnuPG people requested me put -hs identifier in the version
number, to distinguish between an official build, but I'm guessing doing so
with tor causes servers to refuse my connections...

@_subject: Compiling my own version? 
All version I make contains LICENSE file that is included in the official
There's also a link from the page directing to the official page as well.
Yes, certainly.
My intention is not to compete with main tree, but rather supplement for
those people who want "jump start" or "cutting edge" stuff.
Additionally, I sign my file and provide .sig as well to show where it came
from as well.
