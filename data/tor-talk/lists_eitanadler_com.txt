FreeBSD is undergoing the same process as well.
Also include
- Setting the random seeds for the compiler (ie -frandom-seed)
- Stripping path information from the binaries.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Google as default search engine revisited 
Picking a random mail to reply to.
While Google does have less than ideal privacy practices they are
largely mitigated by the other anonymity preserving measures taken in
TBB. In fact the entire point of TBB is to prevent remote sites like
Google from being able to determine anything useful from the data
being sent.
There are two other reasons to prefer Google over other search engines:
- Google is better in many (most?) cases such that the majority of
people prefer using Google
- Every patch against Firefox is another thing to maintain. While it
may seem simple, this has non-trivial cost. Every time Firefox changes
you have to check each and every patch you have and potentially update
I'm not saying that Google should remain the default search engine but
that to switch there should be a specific threat to mitigate and
switching should be the best solution to that threat.

@_subject: [tor-talk] how to answer in tree (mailing list)? 
I'm curious what your MUA is doing when you click reply and reply all
on this list. Does the broken threading happen on other mailing lists
or just this one?
This mailing list violates RFC 2822 and munges reply-to headers. I
wonder if this has anything to do with what you have been seeing.
