@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor: lobbies vs lobbies - Who will prevail? 
Politicians are corrupt, what are they doing against THEIR corruption?  NOTHING.
So don't expect politicians to do anything that is right for you, they
do first what is convenient for them and if thats unfortunate for you
then that's your problem.
What do politicians want?
They want to track every thing that you do good or bad. No respect,
what so ever..
They want to be in a position to rule over you.
They also want to be in a position to make you pay TAX
all these things are kinda stupid in the online situation, though what
do politicians know about technology?
NOTHING, they are 5 - 10 years behind. The only thing they are good at
is messing up their text editor. And spill coffee on the keyboard. Yes
they waste lots of our tax money....  And whaen we need them then ...
they are 'busy' and make you wait and waste your time as well !
Let's see
Are there any Pro-Politic Anti-Politic lobbies ?
In other words, there is no pro or anti tor issue,   there are ONLY
privacy and freedom issues. And Tor solves some of them (not all) Only
because the governments around the world FAIL to give us FREEDOM and
Still i do hear what you are saying, though the real issue is not tor,
it is politics.
Tor developers (i'm not one of them, i'm merely an occasional TOR
user) should not have to any politics, they are not politicians,
programming is what they are good at.
If politicians don't WANT to understand technology and Internet then
they should not rule over it.
Please correct me if i'm wrong, though don't expect a political debate
about it. I'm a human, not a politician.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Attack against Tor: Statistic Manipulation Attack 
Tor should have some kind of bad user detection in the relay.
When the relay detects a bad thing then it relays to old exit nodes
Else it relays to a fresh exit node
then Tor would be doing police work and taking justice in their own hands?
Is that an issue?
Well, bad guys still get an exit node so it's just a little detour..

@_subject: [tor-talk] blocked exit node IP because of spam 
Looks like I lifted a stone that was a home for a few critters.
It gave me some insight in the underlying issues. The biggest (and
still unsolved) issue seems to be the email protocol itself that after
all these years still allows 'strangers' to drop unwanted mail.
So in a way I agree with people who say. It is not TOR's problem.
But in my opinion these spammers still do more harm then good.
So ignoring them seems not the answer.
Would banning them with some kind of blacklist cost more or less
effort then ignoring them and loose time over and over because of
being blocked? (until someone, someday fixes the email protocol...)
I don't think it will help to ask those sites to whitelist tor nodes
since they blocked them in the first place to get rid of the spam in
an easy way (block the IP altogether). It would be nice if there was
some way to build a site that would give TOR and other anonymous
visitors extra privileges and more information then non anonymous
visitors. :-D
I'm not saying that being anonymous is the best way, but if
governments keep doing what they are doing then more and more people
will want to be anonymous. The pencil-pushers are still stuck in the
old ways of how things used to work, and are unaware of the future
visions of 'our generation'. So they will keep stressing to what they
feel is 'protecting' their outdated ways of working. And they will not
be able to see the great opportunities of todays technology and
probably will dig themselves in even deeper.
Another thing that might be an intermediate solution is to give known
(blacklisted) spammers a bunch of know exit nodes and let them spam as
much as they want.  Yeah a bit silly i agree, but then they still can
try their hobby and might still be succesful with their cunning
tricks, and thus TOR could use that info to invent mabye some new
stuff based on that.
As long as normal users can keep surfing in a normal way without being
ranked as being a spammer.
I hope this open-brainwave can inspire someone.

Tomorrow (June 6) IPv6 is officially out there.
What will this do to our privacy?
Is there a way to go 100% private from day 1? I kinda know the answer,

My ISP is offering IPv6 since 2002 (higly experemental back then) and
now ipv6 will be officially be sold.
on top of this there is now glassfiber being rolled out and it will
probably have IPv6 by default.
This kinda forces people to use it, it costs less then DSL and has a
higher speed, so you have to choose to be robbed of money or jump into
the deep ocean of new vulnerabilities.
In short, i really like to make the jump, though it would be nice if i
could swim in all privacy in the big ocean without having sharks
chewing on my legs.

We are sorry, but you are not allowed to register at this

Once your IP address is removed, you will be allowed.
So spammers abuse tor...
I wonder how the tor community thinks about this is this accepted, or

@_subject: [tor-talk] Website auto login <if anonimous> 
Tor crew,
I am having this idea:
A user visits a site wants to log in, but to have an account you are
NOT anonimous anymore..
What about a auto login if user is anonimous..
I realise it might be one hell of a task to do such a thing
Some kind of button, or plugin for browser and website CMS (like
wordpress typo3  drupal joomla etc.)
Can it be done to block everyone who is not anonimised but give true
anonimous connects FULL access to a site.
I already mailed with someone of the tor team and I gained some
insight on the matter and i hope my idea is formulated in the best
basic manner of the task i have in mind.

Please do not reply on this, it is waaay off topic though it might

@_subject: [tor-talk] Website auto login <if anonimous> 
In itself not a bad idea, Though then the user has to do next tor an
extra thing, and i hoped to figure out a more automatic way.
A non invasive website, that respects privacy as good as possible, no
IP logs for instance, but also no accounts, just no data that could
have ANY personal clues. but allowing people to communicate with true
freedom of speech. (i hope people are able to do this in a
sophisticated way and build something out of it)
Could something like this idea work with tor-and other privacy tools.
Think in terms like Wordpress plugin, and eventually a browser plug-in
with a button , though that would give away the cloaked status.
I'm thinking out loud here, to find the edge of what is possible and secure.
maybe with the use of well known out nodes and a button to  "use well
known out node for this site"
anything, as long as the user keeps his full privacy.
Ideally the only requirement to be able to access the site is ... use
tor (or another true privacy tool)
Nowadays with ACTA and other culture killing laws it would be nice to
promote freedom of speech. And hopefully show the lawmakers that their
policy is closed minded and not the way to go.
But this only can work when people can get used to being free, since
everyone is manipulating everyone else to keep each other 'conform
standards'  this just creates friction.
In a system without 'stasi control' the people are free, but sure
there will be a different friction, thats the exiting part, how is
everyone going to deal with that. Are they able to negotiate and meet
each other half way.
A long story to try to find a short tor-rible solution

well i had a good look and bugmenot.com kind of shows why bugmenot is
not the ideal solution
their slogan: "Find and share logins for websites that force you to register:"
And im looking for a way so that i can make a site that gives free
access but 'forces' to be anonymous.
Does this make any sense?
A site with a social function that forces a logon is demoting freedom
of speech. There should be a law against them?
Isn't freedom of speech a ground right?

Change of plan:
I have taken a different approach now.  A frontage with a message
(please only use an anonymous web connection like Tor)
And i'm now looking for an anonymous account system that doesn't use
email addresses or any other personal data in the registration
So users eventually should write down their login / pass.
The good part is that this makes / keeps users aware of their privacy.
