I tend to have a lot of tabs open (over a 100). Given that Firefox
crashes a lot, I used to right-click on a tab and choose "Bookmark All
Tabs". Is there a better way to save what I have open? Or should I still
bookmark all the tabs, export the bookmarks to a separate file, then
delete the bookmarks?
If I use the html file idea for bookmarks in general, is there an easy
way to add new bookmarks? Just use a simple HTML editor?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Open links in TBB 
Here's the workaround that I'm using (on Linux):
o Start TBB. Once Vidalia is ready, TBB-Firefox starts. Once TBB-Firefox
is running, you can look at the command-line arguments; it's "-no-remote
-profile ./Data/profile" The -no-remote causes me problems.
o Exit TBB-Firefox; vidalia stays running.
o Start TBB-Firefox with the command:
"~/tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/firefox -profile
~/tor-browser_en-US/Data/profile &"
o From the program that contains the link that you want to click, set
the browser to be "~/tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/firefox". The program
will then open a link with the command
"~/tor-browser_en-US/App/Firefox/firefox ".
Note that there will be problems if you try to run the regular version
of Firefox. I think that one needs to be started with the -no-remote
flag. The -no-remote was added to TBB sometime in August IIRC so that
the regular version of Firefox could run along side of TBB-Firefox.
Anyone know if what I'm doing is a security risk?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidalia error message with TorBirdy 
In SSL, if the client sends a session ID to resume a session, and the
server accepts it, no certificate is sent. If the server rejects it, or
the client wants a new session, the certificate is sent. This behavior
does not depend on Thunderbird saving the certificate.

The session ID is sent in cleartext. The server (and client) will then
use the session keys associated with the session ID. The idea being that
if the current client is not the same as the original client, it will
not have the session keys to be able to decrypt the traffic. There is no
certificate interaction at all.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Recommended method for updating an existing TBB 
I seem to recall reading on the list before that even saving bookmarks
was a bad idea, and that people were keeping bookmarks in a separate
text or HTML file. Am I recalling incorrectly, or was that old advice?

@_subject: [tor-talk] RSS 
I have Tor and Privoxy installed, and have my RSS reader proxied
through. Normally it works fine, but in the last week, the reader has
not been updating the feeds. Once in a while, a feed updates, but
usually not. I upgraded Privoxy to 3.0.21 and Tor to 0.2.4, but that
didn't help. These messages have also been popping up constantly:
Feb 27 15:18:44 charon Tor[18325]: We tried for 15 seconds to connect to
'[scrubbed]' using exit $DB85464B69738B36A78DDBAE4D7CE9C3A32EE429~afo21
at 62.210.129.149. Retrying on a new circuit.
Feb 27 15:18:44 charon Tor[18325]: Tried for 125 seconds to get a
connection to [scrubbed]:80. Giving up.
Any ideas what's going on? I don't think it's the reader, because I have
two readers that both exhibit this problem.

Isn't blocking first party cookies useful in that it does not allow a site to track navigation within that site? Think of a news site, you don't want the site to know what type of articles you read. Now granted, using TBB, the site won't know the user is you, but for even more safety, wouldn't it be better to not correlate that the same user read articles 1 and 2, especially if there's enough time between reading the two articles such that the exit node has changed?

I would argue that some sort of automatic cookie cleaner (I use Forget Me Not but not in TBB) is still useful. I tend to have multiple windows and tabs open, and I do not restart my browser (or computer) unless I have to. Something that removes cookies without my intervention after closing a tab is much more useful.
