@_subject: TrackHostExits, dns-proxy-tor 
I set up TransPort and dns-proxy-tor and some firewall rules to create an anonymized physical network.  This works well.  I can set up a little machine and not put any personal information on it and not worry about privoxy and JavaScript holes and all that.
I want to use TrackHostExits or MapAddress to prevent my outside IP from changing to particular hosts.  They use cookies tied to the IP for my login.  My IP changing constantly makes me get logged out over and over, sometimes at very inopportune times.
This won't work for me.  I think it's a conflict between dns-proxy-
tor's use of mappings and TrackHostExits/MapAddress.  With TrackHostExits, I never see new entries show up in GETINFO addr-
mappings/all, which it looks on a cursory inspection of consider_recording_trackhost that I should.  I only see dns-proxy-
tor's entries show up.  MapAddress just doesn't do anything (the entry I make shows up in the list, but is not used).
