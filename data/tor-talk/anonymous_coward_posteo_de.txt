What is a good web browser for use with Orbot?
No, Orweb is nothing I would consider. Orweb cannot save bookmarks, does
not support tabbed browsing. I think Orweb is only usable in emergency
What else is usable and has some protection of privacy?
Firefox mobile seem to send a unique identifier, this is a no go.
Firefox is open source, why not create a privacy and TOR friendly fork
of Firefox for Android?

@_subject: [tor-talk] safety of exit nodes 
Hi there,
I have a concern regarding exit nodes in Tor. In my mind it is possible for an attacker to run a malicious exit server that gathers information at the exit point. Of course, this does not compromise anonymity per se, but it still can reveal sensitive data to malicious people. I think the JonDonym project handles this question better. To run a JonDonym exit server you need to be certified. Thus it is much harder to run a malicious JonDonym exit server. Why don?t you offer better protection against malicious exit servers? I think safety of exit nodes is a serious concern.

How can I see what route my data use? Vidalia shows a map, but it is not
that precise to my eyes. I read you can even chose what exit node to
use? Where can I see what exit nodes are available? Can changes to the
exit node be made on the fly while connected to Tor?

I see there are email services within the Tor network that are only

standard email client like Thunderbird (and IMAP or POP3)? Do these
email services interact with the outside email world?

I start Tor with Vidalia. And I use TorBirdy with Thunderbird.
Sometimes I see a message from Vidalia:
This is from the Vidalia log:
Jul 02 22:34:44.907  Application request to port 143: this port is
commonly used for unencrypted protocols. Please make sure you don't send
anything you would mind the rest of the Internet reading!
Why should TorBirdy connect to 143? There is  nothing on port 143 on my
machine though....

When I first set up Thunderbird I used the Starttls settings, I don?t

I already did that. I generally switched from 8 character passwords to
14 character passwords with random characters. For email accounts I now
use passwords with at least 10 random characters.

But, with the latest discussions about Prism and stuff, how much can you
trust the CAs in web browsers and Thunderbird, after all? Do you think
CAs are safe from NSA?s games? I would be surprised if they were.....
How does SSL work with Imap in general? When I first connect to the imap
server it transmitts its certificate, right? Is the certificate then
stored in Thunderbird or will the certificate transmitted again each
time you connect to imap server? I think, if the cert gets saved in the
mail client, it is _some_ protection against the man in the middle...!?

How do you folks use Tor? Do you use it permanently for all your network
connections or only from time to time for certain activities?
I think for certain things it does not make much sense to use Tor, for
example for online banking. When I connect to my bank I am not anonymous
anway. When I use ebay, I am not anonymous either, they have my adress,
Paypal knows my adress. So to torify such things does not make much
sense, doesn?t it?
How do you handle it? Always use Tor?
My goal is to torify more and more of my network activities until only
few things to do without Tor, like banking.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Speculation: Next 10 years of Tor? 
I am confident, Tor will still be available in 10 years, because we need
it. Many governments want to ban anonymity including western
governments. But it is hard technically to ban anonymizers. Look at
China what effort they take to prohibit free access to the net and they
could never succeed to 100%.
But, store the source code on a hard disk and keep it safe. In ten years
we may have to swap source code of Tor in the night in a forrest because
they banned it.

use it. I think it is too important to ban it totally. I hope it is...

When you start Orbot on a Droid, do all network applications
automagically use Orbot or do you need to configure proxy settings

@_subject: [tor-talk] How safe is smartphones today? 
Hello again,
I hope this question is not totally off topic!
Many people use TOR or secure ways to chat on smartphones.
The last months have reveiled how hard secret services attack our phones.
This leads me to the question, how secure are our smartphones at all?
In my case I use Android 4.x.
How easy is it for "them" to break into a smartphone?
Do they really need to install trojan software or does Google and Apple
allow them full access to users phones?
My special concern is about the baseband CPU. The baseband potentially
allows full access to the whole system. And the baseband is closed source.
Thus, the baseband is the perfect trojan for "them". I asked a phone
maker that makes "cryptophones" what they say about the baseband CPU as
a backdoor. They did not reply to the present day.
If it really is that simply for "them" to break into a smartphone, all
the security apps are worthlesse. Be it TOR, ChatSecure, TextSecure,
RedPhone, everything would be crap. "They" could easily steal your
secret keys and contacts.
Thus, what does the scientific community say about these concerns?
Bruce Schneier said "forget your data".
Is it really that simple as Bruce Schneier says, forget your data?
If it was that simple, it would be pointless to use TOR or any software
with security in mind on a smartphone, it simply would not make any sense.
And the worst thing is, the baseband CPU is closed source, even  if you
use open source like Cyanogenmod, you still have the baseband backdoor
on your device and you can do *nothing* about it.
What do you say? The battle seems lost, just as the whole war seems lost?
Thank yours.

Nathan Freitas:
Thanks to all for replying.
Well, I try not to get caught in the dragnet. Besides, I have no special
threat model or fear.
But, the situation could change quickly in certain situations without
your intention.
For example, I want to talk to political activists, I would like to
discuss with them, no matter if I share their views or not. This could
easily make you interesting for certain people. Sometimes just talking
to certain people could make you suspicious.
And this is my concern.
Is a mobile device safe to use for "sensitive" discussions?
In my view and recent events suggest you can become a target, although
you are just a small number. Just talking to people could cause this.
If I listen to the discussion in this thread, a mobile device is not
adequate at all to protect your data in case of a targetted attack.
I guess, the only safe way would be to use an offline device for storing
data and a second device for online communication. And a third device
may be necessary. There are devices, that connect with bluetooth to your
smartphone and do all all the encryption totally encapsulated in its own
little box.
I don?t have any current need for such steps, but want to know what is
the current state in security.
