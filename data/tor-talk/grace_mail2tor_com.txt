He is using OpenPGP and GnuPG properly, but I believe you miss some
important fact about it. The original author did not give the key
details nor he did put his key id (before you added to your keyring).
Somebody reading this list could have created a key pair, and uploaded
to keyserver. Now you might have malicious key, which you will use to
encrypt your emails, and somebody having an access to that e-mail
address (via ISP or AOL) could read your email.
Do not blindly add keys just by searching the name. Wait for the
original author to at least verify using e-mail, or his web address. Of
course, there would be no guarantee for e-mail to be changed during the
transport. But it is a little unlikely to both change e-mail and key on
the web server. It depends on your threat model. I hope I made my point.

It depends on how much security you want. To use tor, only tunneling
your HTTP requests via proxy is enough. However, you are open to other
browser attacks such as flash, javascript, etc. Tor Browser is not
solely for connecting to Tor, but it comes with decent plugins and
configuration to make your web a little more safer than your ordinary
browser with TOR tunneling. So, try to use Tor browser when possible.

Confirmed. TF seems to be working just fine right now.

I've never entered the captcha on TF. When I saw this mail, I tried
again and I was not presented with a captcha page, but TF website.
That's what I meant by "working and fine" since TF was not working when
presented with Cloudflare captcha page.

JS was enabled when encountered captcha. However, when JS is not
enabled, I still see the same CF page in different sites. When I try to
complete captcha, it doesn't work. Somehow, CF requires JS to be
enabled. It does not explicitly states it but when you don't enable JS,
you cannot pass captcha easily.

Or warning the user to use full-disk encryption and to avoid logging?
Encrypting the chat log or sensitive information on the chat with
user's GnuPG key is a good idea as well. However, it is better to not
have the logs in the first place.
