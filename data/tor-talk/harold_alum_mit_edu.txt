@_subject: [tor-talk] Stop pushing stackexchange in every thread 
I would agree that people should not redirect questions to stackexchange
for two reasons:
   1. Stackexchange's stated purpose is to be a repository for the best
   answers to questions.  When the answer to a question has been hashed out in
   some other forum, there is nothing preventing people here from re-posting
   the question and best answer on stackexchange for posterity.
   2. More importantly, if people constantly redirect others, then someone
   who legitimately needs an answer to this question and does a Google search
   will pull up a page of posts without an answer to the question, but just a
   mass of redirections.   This is very frustrating.  Search for A, and get a
   mass of links with people telling you to search for A.
Just my two bitcoin-cents.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Help with getting a good automated sign up script 
Rock, you can check out mine:  I haven't had time to add a CAPTCHA yet, because I'm more interested in
working on getting mail sent to non-onion sites to use the tor network
without leaking DNS and so on.  The registration script depends on how you
are storing your login information, and there are a lot of ways to do that.
 I'm using vpopmail, and I hacked vqregister, which is mentioned in the
squirrelmail plugins page.  Vqregister is truly horrible, and I had to hack
it pretty badly to get it to work.  If you want it, though, you can have
it.  But probably you're using something else (like postfix/postfixadmin),
and so the architecture won't work for you.
This hidden mail service will probably only be useful for mail to other
.onion sites, because most large e-mail providers block e-mail from tor
exit nodes, as I found out during testing.
