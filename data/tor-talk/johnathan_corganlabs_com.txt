@_subject: [tor-talk] Padding effective against simple passive end-to-end 
Running a Bitcoin node set to use Tor as a proxy, and also publishing its
listening port as a hidden service, will generate a constant stream of
intermittent, fairly low-bandwidth connections, which slowly change over
time.  You don't even have to use Bitcoin for anything, just passively
participate in the P2P network traffic that gets relayed.
One machine I have, there are 8 outgoing connections and 14 incoming hidden
service connections, resulting in about 15-20 Kbps up and down, with 35
open Tor circuits.
Now whether this kind of chaff makes any difference to a correlation attack
I have no idea =)
