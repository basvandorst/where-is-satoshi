@_subject: [tor-talk] some websites are blocking me now 
Since I started using Tor browser I can't reach certain websites.   is a good example.  I get an error message that "this ip has been automatically blocked".  I wonder if using Tor is causing this, or if I've been assigned an ip address that is unacceptable to these websites?  And how can I get Tor to change the ip address so I can test with a different one...any thoughts on this problem?
