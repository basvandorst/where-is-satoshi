I don't know of any in the U.S. however, I will search public records
for anything.  Data won't be available for searches and seizures if a
prosecution did not result, due to the government protecting the
innocent. (which incidentally, might mean no data, I don't think laws
would permit successful prosecution of exit nodes here).

It seems that our mirror updating script is a little outdated.  It is
located at
and is a perl script.
Basically, it checks to see if a mirror has been updated and if even
slightly out of date, it will report the mirror as out of date.  We
would like to have mirrors that have are out of date more than 24
hours being reported Out of Date, those updated within 24 hours,
current... however I'm not sure how to code this.
Any pl guru out there who is inclined to help, please submit new code
to me off list, and thank you for your help!

@_subject: eliminating bogus port 43 exits 
I've read the entire thread and I still have one persisting question in
my mind...
Why are "bogus port exists" bad, and why should I eliminate them form my
exit policy?
*if* I want to keep the type of traffic somewhat also anonymous
(assuming the operator is not looking at the content) then I might use a
separate port to communicate my information.  I don't know if I totally
feel comfortable in this, most especially when we start talking about
peering into the content.  And even looking to see what the protocol
actually is, is peering.  That should be private, as an ethical
consideration for all operators.

I can not agree.  Sniffing the traffic at the exit node actually does
jeopardize the reason people are using this software in the first place.

The tor network can not encrypt data leaving the edge of tor.  That is
to say, once data has left it's last hop, towards the site (or
service) the data is in the clear.  There is no way for Tor to
magically protect your data from eavesdropping.  I am however,
attempting to discourage eavesdropping by operators.
Just because you can do something, does not always mean you should, is
my thought.  We should also encourage end to end encryption.

There was no pleading.  There is no ruining of Tor.  That is hyperbole.
I got it that operators will snoop.  But if you can't read the
documentation, and get the grok the gist of the idea behind Tor...
You want me to provide hard facts?  It does not take a whitepaper to
inform me that peering at traffic leaving the border is "A Good Thing" TM.

Just a couple of notes, since some Tor Project website mirror
operators may be subscribed to this list:
Recently there was some discussion regarding a discussion list for
mirror operators.  This has recently been brought to fruition.
Instructions on subscription are located here...
Some details regarding the list may be found on the first post to the
One key change is that mirror changes/additions are now posted to this
list.  In the past, changes/additions were sent to tor-webmaster
Something that is also desired, is the admin contact for the mirror
operators.  Preferably stated in an introduction to the list.
Alternatively, you can send me the contact directly, if you please :)
A good email address is all that is requested.  This information will
help to better contact those operators whose mirrors are out of date,
or otherwise not working.  This way, we can let mirror operators know
when their mirror *may* be misconfigured or non-updated.
Also, if you host a mirror, and you notice that your organization is
missing, or inaccurate, and you would like to update it, please also
post that to the list.  Alternatively, let me know directly.
Thank you for supporting Tor!
Very best,

What log level are you running when this occurs?

@_subject: Vidalia issue yet ANOTHER problem 
There are many log levels, well five I believe.  The more detailed/intense
the log level, the more information is presented to the "message window" in
vidalia.  For example, the "Notice" level will log only important messages,
and there are only a few of those.  However, if the conf, or vidalia
message window is set to the "debug" log level, a great deal of information
is presented.  On Windows Vista, the debug log level slows and halts
things, due to the shear level of information presented.  It should scroll
very intensely and rapidly at debug level, I don't recommend it when using
the vidalia message window.  You may find the logfile if you are logging to
the disk, will grow exponentially at this level.  I hope this helps.
