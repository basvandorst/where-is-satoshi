@_subject: problem with bridges and a suggestion 
dear friends,
china is blocking?TOR? more and more strict,
I can't?establish a TOR circuit?even I?updated bridges in config file
of torrc with info retrieved?from email replies from bridges at torproject.org.
this morning,?I got some new bridges through a hidden https proxy and
established a TOR circuit, but after some time, I lost the connection
and couldn't? establish a TOR circuit any more.
from my knowledge to china's blocking methods, I believe they found my
newly got bridges through network traffic protocol analysis, and
blocked them.
so my suggestion is:
use a general protocol for TOR clients to interact with bridges, so
that they can't distinguish the traffic between TOR clients and
so that they can't find new bridges got through private ways.
the general protocol could be https which is encryption protected;
the general protocol could be plain http, if you can encode its
content dynamically and privately, and don't make it display any
by the way, I'm not a native english speaker, please pardon my awkward english.

dear andrew,
thanks a lot for your prompt reply.
as to your question:
Can you send debug logs to tor-assistants at torproject.org with what
happens when your client tries to connect to the bridges?
my answer:
sorry, I'm not familiar with TOR development, could you kindly tell me which file or files the debug logs are in?
as to your comment:
This is unlikely.  In our experience, they are merely blocking IP:Port combinations.
my answer:
I know some developers of china's blocking projects, so I know that they have more methods than that.
first, the so-called "static blocking" method include both mere IP mode and IP:port combination mode;
second, the so-called "dynamic blocking" mothod can break tcp connection upon traffic fingerprints.
hope I can help.

Tor traffic through bridges vs. public relays is the same.  There is not
a special "bridge connection".  See

dear andrew,
I tried to reach directory server with the following config:
 a https proxy to reach directory server
HttpProxy IP:port
but it doesn't work, does not the directory server support https proxy?
my suggestion:
let the directory server support https proxy, so that tor clients could reach it through a hidden https proxy;
the directory server tests the reachability from some relays to the requesting tor clients, then sends back to tor clients a merely enough number of relays reachable by the requesting tor clients;
in order to accomplish step 2, you have to set up some mechanics for relays to actively test reachability from them to tor clients.
hope I can help.

The question though is... how do they find them? Sure, you can get the
directory list, scrape the common bridge lists. However... this pretty
quickly is just "Whack a Mole". You have to imagine that they are
smart enough to figure that a person who was using tor yesterday, is
probably looking for a new bridge today.
Once you know who, even if its a small subset, is using tor, and smart
enough to find bridges as you shut them down, well... it wouldn't be
hard to watch them, and identify which connections of theirs are
bridges, and then push out new block lists. Even if I can't prove that
your connection from port x to port y is a tor connection, I can still
connect to the same remote port and negotiate an ssl connection myself
and verify if its a bridge. Hell, it could be automated.
It may not be 100%, but, it doesn't really need to be. Its not like
you need all the users all the time, just enough to raise the bar and
cut down the numbers.
Perhaps other ways of hiding it are needed. As it is, it would be
trivial to connect via ssl and verify if a machine talks onion router.
It might be harder if there were multiple protocol paths into it. What
if I connect on port 25  and get a normal mail server, then start tls
from within protocol and use a command to switch to onion routing. I
connect on port 636 and its ldap first. 993 and its IMAP over ssl.
Perhaps the secret command to initiate the protocol could be part of
the bridge description?

Rather than continue to hijack the old thread, here's a new one about
bridges and china.
I'm fully aware the GFW seems to have successfully crawled
 and added all of those bridges into their
blocking regime.  The email distribution method, bridges at torproject.org,
may also have been crawled and added to the blocking regime.  There are
still 3 other pools of bridge addresses, one of which is held in
reserve.  It seems the other two methods are continuing to work, as a
paltry 5000 connections from China still can access Tor daily.  This is
vastly smaller than the 100,000 or so we used to get.  The other methods of obtaining bridges are slower and more viral.  They
use social networking technologies like twitter and qq to distribute
bridge addresses.  I've been told if you search on baidu, you can find
such bridge addresses.  And until now, they still work.  We've given
some addresses to trusted networks inside China. What they do with the
bridges is up to them.  I've heard some are bridge addresses are being
released by blog posts, BBS posts, qq, and ads on taobao. I'm assuming
the admins of the GFW read or-talk in some fashion.  They are doing
their job and we're doing ours.
Conversely, Tor supports 3rd party http/https proxies.  Many people use
Tor because they want the privacy aspects of it, not just the ability to
circumvent a firewall.  You can use the 3rd party http/https proxy as
the access layer around the blocking system, and then to tor.
This is an arms race, we're working on next steps in it.

There are two ways to do this, through Vidalia or editing your torrc.

Your client makes a 1-hop tunnel to the directory server if it needs to
get the consensus file.
