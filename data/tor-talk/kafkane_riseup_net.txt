Hash: SHA512
this program is not affiliated with the Tor Project, so in order to get
specific assistance you'll have to talk to the original developer, Micah
i'll help you, though. it appears you're fetching the project source
code from Micah's github repository for the project. the only way i can
think of verifying the authenticity is to hash the .deb file you build
before you install it.
i'm building on debian. my sha256 hash is below:
good luck.

in Tails, you only need to enter the full bridge line from the BridgeDB
site [0] (Tails supports ONLY vanilla bridges, obfs2, obfs3, obfs4, and
scramlesuit [1]. meek is not yet supported). you do not need to manually
select the type of bridge that is entered-- Tails will do this. in the
case of obfs4, the bridge line would look like:
"obfs4 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxxx 65D0F960D77B54C148F1B75D845820A85639C6FD
i'm not sure about orbot, but it should be the same way if it does not
provide a dropdown box to choose.
happy surfing.
