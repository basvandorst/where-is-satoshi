@_subject: [tor-talk] can't get tor to work :( 
Hi, i downloaded the tor browser bundle today, and tried to get it to run.
In the default mode, it will hang on "connecting to a relay directory
failed (no route to host)"
If i put in bridge settings, it will hang on "authenticating to the
tor network".
I've forwarded port 80, 443, 9001-9040 tcp&udp to my windows box,
added pipolo.exe, tor.exe, tor-resolve.exe and vidalia.exe in my
windows firewall. I have no other firewall between me and the
I'd appreciate some help.
