Yes when i access the site via tor browser with .onion address, than only
markup loads up, and images also not loading including scripts &
stylesheets. About rules, what kind of rules do i need to set and how. I
also have read Tor Relays & Bridges, is that what you're are refering to?
Please advise. thanks...

Yes the site is working fine if i access with with normal browser (without
Tor) in my localhost, but only markup (html) loads up when tried with Tor
browser. And on normal browser i open it with name like '
and i believe this has default 80 port.
And here are my HiddenServicePort in torrc.

Hi this is Umair, I?ve downloaded tor and configured it according to
instructions, now I got both public & secret keys and I can access server /
site with public key, so far everything is working fine.
Next I?ve installed OpenCart eCommerce CMS and its working fine on normal
browser everything is loading perfect, but when I try to access it via
public key than only html markup loads up, it seems stylesheet & other
scripts aren?t loading. I also think it could be because of port, but I
don?t know how to fix this issue.
So please let me know should I continue with OpenCart CMS or is there any
better CMS for TOR. So please suggest me and guide me about the OpenCart
issue. Thanks?
