@_subject: [tor-talk] Reasoning behind 10 minute circuit switch? 
Hi all,
I'm working on doing a study on user tolerance of delays (for example, latency on Tor).
During our discussion, a bit of a debate occured about the TBB's circuit switching. I was wondering if there's any research that's been done to arrive at the 10 minute window for circuit switching, or if that was number picked arbitrarily?
Thanks for the help.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB restore closed tabs 
Do you mean that if you opened a tab in private mode, turned it off, then hit CTRL-SHIFT-T the tab would open?
It's normal behavior for Firefox (the code TBB is based on) to allow restoration of tabs within the private browsing window.
(Though we can certainly discuss the pros and cons of that design decision)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Yelp blocking Tor users from viewing entire site 
So today I noticed Yelp appears to be blocking Tor.
I tried using multiple identities, but get a 503 error every time.
Anyone else have this issue?
This seems really overbroad... I could understand the argument against letting a Tor user post reviews, but to disallow simple browsing seems like overkill.

Is that common behavior - blocking Tor users from the normal site if
they have a .onion?
Seems like not the most user friendly design decison.

If you're interested in free literature on anonymity, AnonBib is a great
I suggest reading some of the founational papers.
Considering your technical background "Tor: The Second-Generation Onion
Router" is a good place to start. It has a link on to a free HTML
version on Anonbib:
If you click the star next to the title of the paper on AnonBib, it
takes you to the Google Scholar page. You can see who has cited the
paper, and what GS considers to be related literature.
You can repeat that process for any papers that catch your eye.
Have fun!
PS: If you want to search on Google Scholar easily, one simple way is to
append !gsc to your query when searching with DuckDuckGo. Google has the
link to it buried a bit in the current UI.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't CERT contract out to federal
agencies sometimes?

It's uncommon, but not unheard of, for someone to think just because a paper contains no classified information, they can publish it without running it past the agency they work for. Often after being informed they can be sanctioned, there is not enough time to get approval before the conference, so the paper is withdrawn.
