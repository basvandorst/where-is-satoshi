@_subject: Virtual Machines - what is their use? 
I think there are two useful usecases for a vm in combination with tor:
For Hidden Services:
If you run your HS inside a VM, it is harder for a imaginary attacker to
gather the location / identity of the HS.
For a "simple" User:
If you run all the applications inside a vm, it is easier for you to
ensure that there is no "leaking" application, which means that an
application sends traffic which does not go through tor.

Like the rest of the page in question
"Tor exit nodes do not always allow SSL/TLS encrypted sessions either,
but since these are vital for e-commerce, many do, even behind otherwise
restrictive firewalls and censorware. The Tor system will, after a short
delay, find a reasonably randomly chosen exit node, which does accept
SSL/TLS connection, statistically, this will usually be located outside
of the United Kingdom. "
Uhm? I think every legit exit node allows https.
"Remember that using any SSL/TLS https:// encrypted proxy server
session, or the mostly encrypted Tor proxy cloud, may protect the
contents of your traffic from local snoopers, but if you have to login
or otherwise authenticate to a web server or email system etc., then
those details (including your real IP address) will still probably be
logged by the target server, regardless of the link or session
encryption, and so your whistleblower details may still be exposed, if
that server is physically seized as evidence by the police or is
sneakily compromised by intelligence agencies etc., either through
technical hacking or bugging or by putting pressure on the systems
Uhm - well I think it is true that the page I'm logging in to knows my
user credentials, but I don't get the point why they should need to
snoop them from my traffic, as its probably in their database.
Conclusion: I wouldn't trust any of the contents of this page ;)

And to the original question: Due to the way tor works, it is not
possible to configure an exit node to only allow traffic from egypt. You
are only able to configure what types of outbound connections you allow.

@_subject: Is "gatereloaded" a Bad Exit? 
while scrolling through the tor status page (torstatus.blutmagie.de), I
stumpled upon the following node (the reason why it came to my eye was
the long uptime):
gatereloaded 550C C972 4FA7 7C7F 9260 B939 89D2 2A70 654D 3B92
This node looks suspicious to me, because there is no contact info given
and the exit policy allows only unencrypted traffic:
reject 0.0.0.0/8:*
reject 169.254.0.0/16:*
reject 127.0.0.0/8:*
reject 192.168.0.0/16:*
reject 10.0.0.0/8:*
reject 172.16.0.0/12:*
reject 194.154.227.109:*
accept *:21
accept *:80
accept *:110
accept *:143
reject *:*
Am I missing something? I'm wondering why the status page lists this
node as non-exit, because it clearly allows outgoing traffic on ports
21,80,110 and 143?
I'm aware of the fact that it is not recommended to use tor without
additional encryption, but some users do. And I dont see any reason for
only allowing unencrypted traffic than snooping?
Can anyone clearify this? If the admin of this node is on the list,
would he please explain this situation?

As far as I understand the ExitPolicy, the first matching rule applies.
Which means, that this is an Exit Node, at least for ports 21,80,110 and
143 to IP adresses that do not match the reject rules above the
corresponding accept rules. Anyone is free to correct me if I'm wrong,
but a middle node has only _one_ ExitPolicy which is "reject *:*".

Yeah, I'm not saying "this is evil!!!!", but want to bring it into
discussion, because I was unable to get any reasonable explanation for
this exitpolicy.
Of course these ports are popular, but 443 is popular as well? So for me
it looked like "pick all the popular _unencrypted_ ports".

Sounds good. But what to do for now? Just creating a list of nodes which
only allow unencrypted traffic and put them into the ExcludeExitNodes
list? Shouldnt these nodes be excluded by default?
I'm unsure. I want to stress again that I'm not saying any operator is
doing anything evil, but I think we should find some way to avoid nodes
which have such weird exitpolicies.

Yes, we all know that, hopefully the average user knows that. But in my
opinion this has nothing to do with having an exitpolicy that "attracts"
unencrypted traffic. Just the fact that everyone (hopefully) knows that
the traffic can be recorded, it does not make it better if I do? I would
have asked the specific operator about his exitpolicy, but as I noted,
there is no contact info given, which makes it even more suspicious. Not
the fact that there is no contact info - there are many nodes without
contact infos - but I thought the combination is odd.
I totally disagree. Of course, you could argue that it's his fault and
so forth. I would agree to that, but on the other hand, should accept to
make this even easier? Additionally, if some guy gets his account
somewhere hacked after having used tor, it looks bad. And at that point,
the user does not really care about "I told you so!!!". He is going to
tell his friends "I used tor and my account got hacked.".
These nodes are marked as BadExits for now, which does not hurt, because
if the operators of these nodes care about Tor, they are going to ask
"why is my node marked as bad exit" and you could have a discussion
about it. The operators can tell us why they choose these exitpolicy or
we can help to improve them. If those nodes - which have sometimes been
up for several months - silently disappear, I know what I'll think.

Nobody does that, but I think its fair to say that if you want that
somebody can contact you about your node, you publish your contact
details in the directory. And if you enter wrong contact infos, you made
clear that you dont want to be contacted. I think marking them as "bad"
and waiting for the admin to show up is the easiest way to go. Lets call
it a "cry"-test. Just wait until someone shows up and cries.

This was not my intention. But I think it should be possible to ask a

name / email there. But at least some way to contact them would probably
make this whole discussion completely useless.
They are still working for the benefit of the network, but not as exit
at the moment.

I would tell them as well that YOU blocked their IP in your exit policy
but all the other exit node operators don't, so if they really, really
want to prevent such things without always having to deal with abuse
etc, they should block tor. Or they should live with it. Everything else
won't work over a longer period of time.
Maybe because they are technically incompetent to do so? It might be
cheaper to buy some auto-complaining appliance which bothers abuse teams
because someone rips their webpage.
