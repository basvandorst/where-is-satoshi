Doesn't tor already have this? Connections to certain ports (21, 22, 80 among others) that are typically reserved for long-lived connections will avoid nodes that have been up for less than a certain amount of time.

Ideally you'd have a board with a mini-PCI slot in which to put a SSL accelerator, since the puny router CPU probably can't handle crypto too well. Soekris (  ) boards would be good for this.
