The process looks relatively straight forward.  I will draft the 5
questions in the application and put it out to for-internal for
comments/suggestions by Friday, 12/20.

Thanks for the link, really interesting.  We can certainly look at having
our shirts produced by Hanes, however, in past experiences when selecting
the best brand of shirts in regards to comfort, quality and durability
Hanes often feel short.  Certainly worth reconsidering based on this
information.  We also have an small inventory of current shirts (our vendor
went from print-on demand to silk screen printing earlier this year) which
would need to be used up before printing more, however when we are ready,
the good news is our vendor is flexible and will use whatever brand we

Juris - this root design shirt (though not in these colors exactly) is used
as a give away item for relay operators and donors.  As well as a popular
shirt at dev meetings.  Having it sold through torservers may be confusing
to people.  Why don't we just add it to the Tor Store?

Yes - I realize this, Printfection moved from a print on-demand system
(which everything in the Tor store currently is) to an silk screening and
inventory - it's in transition and I keep asking them to add it.
Still, it's not a good idea to have the root design sold by anyone other
than The Tor Project.
