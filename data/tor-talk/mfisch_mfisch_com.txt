@_subject: [tor-talk] Unsigned Mac OS X binary for TorBrowser 
The installer can be verified with PGP using the published signature and GPG or PGP software. This however, is beyond the technical prowess of the vast majority of Mac OS X users of the torbrowser bundle.
TorProject should be registered as an Apple software developer, and the binary should be signed, both to increase credibility of the torproject and the safety of users.
This is especially important as with the most recent builds of Mac OS X unsigned software binaries trigger a warning that most users (and rightly so) find distressing and difficult to deal with; a workaround is required to launch the binary which is not readily evident.
Please wish-list this, I didn't see a bug reporting interface at first glance. Understand there may be fees associated with developer registration.

@_subject: [tor-talk] misconfigured mailing list (mailman software) for 
Upon signing up for the mailing list on the list server, my password was emailed to me in plaintext. In the year 2012 this is extremely bad security practice. At the very least the sign-up page should warn users to make the password unique.
The password may also be stored in reverseable format.
I used a unique random password for this mailing list, I'm going to guess however a significant portion of the mailing list either uses this password in other locations, a significant subset of them probably can't trust their mailbox to be secure.

I think the idea of getting an organization such as the EFF (with credibility Apple couldn't afford to deny) to sign off on the binaries sounds like the only plausible solution -- though I understand the politics of this aren't exactly trivial. I didn't realize legal kung-fu was necessary when you don't plan to submit to the app store. This type of thing is something that should be investigated long-term however especially considering the Mountain Lion default of denying unsigned binaries, and the Tor Project's mission of increasing use of Tor by mainstream users to increase credibility of the project.
All that said, there is a simple short-term fix:
A warning and subtle protest of Apple's closed gatekeeper methodology should be included in the OS X download webpage. This is actually a great technology to protect users computers from privacy invasions by rogue software, it's just in Apple's blood to exert a bit more control than desktop users find comfortable. Also, uploaded some screenshots to google drive to highlight the simple but unintuitive workaround, once the application is added to the gatekeeper exception list no further warnings will be produced:
three images labelled step 1, 2 and 3.
Also, I think it's important not to totally discredit the gatekeeper technology. If users turn this off they significantly increase risk exposure to their machines despite any idealogical concerns.
