@_subject: Problems with XS4ALL in The Netherlands 
Hash: SHA1
Hello fellow Tor relay operators,
Six days ago XS4ALL shut down the DSL connection of a friend of mine who
was running a Tor exit relay on this DSL connection (relay nickname
ILiekMudkipz). They did this because they thought there was a trojan
running on this system.
This isn't the first time XS4ALL did this, but this time they threatened
him with terminating his DSL account if you would run a Tor relay again.
After making the promise that he wouldn't run a Tor exit again on this
DSL connection, they reconnected him. He forwarded the e-mail where they
threathened him with terminating his account but it's in Dutch. If
anyone wants to read it, please send me a mail.
This is a warning for all Dutch Tor relay operators who run a Tor exit
relay on their XS4ALL DSL. XS4ALL doesn't like Tor. I'm kinda shocked of
coming to conclusion that one of the most liberal ISP's in the
Netherlands, who fights for human rights on the Internet like privacy
and unfiltered access, doesn't like Tor and even punishes exit relay
operators for running a relay.

It's pronounced as Tor, just like the first part of the word torrent ;)

@_subject: They know I'm using a proxy(Tor)...but how? 
There are several DNSBL's that list Tor nodes. If they check against a  DNSBL who lists Tor exit nodes they can detect that you're behind Tor..

Tor exitnodes are found on several blacklists where these public  proxy's are also found on. It seems very likely to me that they just  check the IP your connection is originating from on several blacklists..

It's really scary when a random website can request your physical location imo.. I really hope you can disable that shit in the new version of Firefox when they include it..

Torbutton blocks Flash because Flash doesn't use Tor and would destroy your anonimity.

@_subject: Tor check and DNS exitlist down? 
Are the Tor check page  and the DNS  exitlist.torproject.org down? I can't reach them over Tor and not over  the normal internet. Is there something wrong with the servers behind

Hash: SHA1
It's actually injected by it's ISP, Comcast. The IP which s.tobban.com  resolves to is assigned to Comcast. I don't think the exit node admin  can't do anything about it.

@_subject: Tor-Server and dynamic ip. 
Hello Bernd,
Tor detects a changed IP address and will republish it's descriptor  with your new IP. The Tor clients that are connected to your server  will detect that it isn't reachable on the old IP and they will seek a  new Tor router to make a new circuit.

Strato V-PowerServers tend to run out of RAM very quickly when Tor is running. I stopped running Tor on my V-PowerServer because of this..

Keep in mind that plan FTP without any encryption isn't that smart  over Tor. You are sending your userdetails without any encryption over  someone else's link..

Put this in your tor config file:
OutboundBindAddress *IP*
Substitute *IP* with the IP of the interface you want Tor to use for  the outbound connections. All the traffic will now flow over that  interface ;)

You get payed $0.20USD/MB? I only got an offer of 0,05 euro/MB from  the AIVD (the Dutch intelligence service). Maybe I should think about  moving to the VS..

Hello everyone,
The Tor exit JustaNode (fingerprint:  dcc1c3f96b8459dc7a88e711f9cb2416126eb9d6,  ) does a MITM attack on every SSL connection. The SSL certificate is  self signed for every SSL'ed website you want to request. I think this  exit must be marked a BadExit.

I have the same experience with Leaseweb as John Brooks. They seem to understand what Tor is and don't disconnect you at the first complaint that they get about your Tor node. When you explain them what you are doing on the box they do nothing.

On 6 jun 2010, at 17:47, You can ignore the first warning. Tor downloads the missing keys.
Google presents a CAPTCHA to users that are doing a very large number of requests or have malware installed on their computer. If a user on the Tor exit you use has malware installed on his computer you also get the CAPTCHA presented, because Google can't see the difference between the users of that Tor node ;)

You can use the command torify, it works for a lot of programs. Put torify in front of the command you want to give and most of the times it proxies the connections perfectly through Tor.
