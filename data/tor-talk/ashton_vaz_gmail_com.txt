Regarding my intent, let me elaborate.  I was looking for a simple, coherent and intelligent answer or discussion.  I invite you to not respond to any of my future posts or queries if you can't refrain from trite adolescent comments.  It should be obvious that I am *ignorant* of the what is triggering your panic, hence the question.  The rest of your response however, is much appreciated.
I disagree that the law should explicitly *protect* the operator.  Its equivalent to asking that there be a law to protect knife manufacturers, because people use knives to kill other people.  (Er no, thanks but I think that would just cause law bloat.)  The law should neither do more nor assume more in the case of anonymizing server operators than it does with knife manufacturers, i.e. innocent until proven guilty.
No, intent isn't clearly evident from a mere complaint.  You're assuming that it is.  A complaint and associated emails, logs, posts, etc. can only serve to identify that your ip was the final origin of the illegal action, nothing more.  It needs to be proven in court that you were the first origin of the action.  If you're just a middle node you have nothing to fear.  Even if you're an entry node or client node you have nothing to fear.  You've done nothing wrong.  Even examination of your seized hardware will demonstrate that fact.
I agree, partially.  Only the final origin is you. Any attempt in court to prove you as the first origin will fail.  You're not complicit in the abuse, just an unwilling pawn used by someone else.  So again, I ask, what's the fear for?  The courts can't charge you for receiving or forwarding the abuse *knowingly*.  That's what the law is about - receiving & forwarding abuse *knowingly*.
I'm certain that there will be charges laid and some pain on the part of a *few* people (yes, with a few lawyers making good $$$ :) ).  But that is how the system works.  They'll try prosecuting a few people & fail when it'll be seen that Tor node operators are not *knowingly* receiving & forwarding abuse.  (Neither are i2p or Freenet operators doing so.)
In other words, doesn't such a law apply to your ISP as well?  It is they who carried the communication *to you* in the first place.  All the ISPs upstream to you are complicit and involved in the "annoy, abuse, threaten or harass" intent.  If they, large corporations with loads of cash are not required to examine all packets and prevent certain traffic, then, neither can you, a poor single individual be expected to do so.  You're merely running a router, nothing more.  In that sense, you're identical to every ISP, no?
You don't know that.  You're assuming it is true.  Read the Tor documentation sometime.  A variety of people (government spies included) are using Tor & other anonymizing networks!  It isn't just being used by losers to abuse people.

I hope not...but we'll have to wait & see.  If a Tor operator does get charged & tried, I hope he/she has the sense to find a lawyer competent enough (in computing technologies) to demonstrate the absurdity of the attempt, i.e. the attempt to equate passive resource sharing for legal purposes with deliberate manipulation of that sharing for illegal purposes.
But being the suspicious type - I do agree that the watchers need to be watched closely. Absolute Power & what-not...

Hey Nate!
Don't forget to set AccountingMax & AccountingStart as well.  If you don't, you could be in for a huge price shock at the end of the month.  Many ISPs have a monthly bandwidth cap and charge ridiculous amounts of money for each MB or GB over the cap.  In your case each month at full utilization, you would use 248 GB [(50KB/s up + 50KB/s down) * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month]for Tor traffic alone!  If you were with my ISP, you'd have to pay an additional $ 1, 128 CAD [(248-60) * $6/GB] each month.  That's why I'd strongly urge you to set up a reasonable AccountingMax & daily AccoutingStart.
In my case (rogers.com), I have a 60GB monthly limit (5Mbps down, 768Kbps up -> 640KBps down, 96KBps up) with a 6 CAD/GB charge if I exceed it.  Since there's 4 computers sharing my connection (email, webserving, gaming, Shareaza, Azureus) while I'm also running Tor & a webserver I have to be careful with my usage.  Read the notes for AccountingStart to understand why I've chosen daily & not monthly accounting for Tor.  Here are my current settings for bandwidth control:
    BandwidthRate 30 KB
    BandwidthBurst 40 KB
    MaxAdvertisedBandwidth 30 KB
    AccountingMax 262144 KB
    AccountingStart day 00:00
According to the settings above, I'll use (256MB/day up + 256MB/day down) * 30 days = 15 GB.  I'm running Tor, i2p, Freenet, web server, 4 browsers, 3 Azureus, 3 Shareaza, 2 gamers, 3 email clients. This leaves me with 8GB per month "spare" and no noticeable performance drop.
For each Shareaza client (x3) and Azureus client (x3) I have 192KBps, 28KBps up.  That leaves me with about 64KBps down, 12KBps up spare even if all three clients are running simultaneously.  This is acceptable for our browsing, emailing & gaming purposes.  Your mileage may vary!
You can probably double my Shareaza/Azureus settings if you're only using a single computer and still have a reasonable experience. Once again - *please* watch your maximum bandwidth - don't go over your monthly cap. Hope this helps.

I assumed that BandwidthRate & BandwidthBurst are for your local Tor instance's knowledge & MaxAdvertisedBandwidth is what is broadcast to the network.
I kept MaxAdvertisedBandwidth the same as my BandwidthRate as I wasn't clear about this either - I have a slow machine & didn't want a high CPU load due to Tor - which is what it seems to ensure.  Perhaps a developer can better explain this option?
Many ISPs take a "we're free to change our policy at any time" policy.  Mine certainly did.  I received no email, call or letter stating that they were implementing the bandwidth cap.  I found out through a friend that works for them.  Unless you're certain that they will contact you before they change their policy, it might be a good idea to implement bandwidth accounting, so that you can install Tor & not worry about it.
Since they do no filtering, if you're allowed to run a webserver, you may want to also change your ORPort is 443 & your DirPort is 80 (according to the wiki - this helps people that can't visit ports other than well known ports - in this case HTTPs & HTTP)

Seems like a reasonable law.  Why are people scared/upset by this?  Isn't anyone paying attention to this clause - "and with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person"?  It isn't anonymity or anonymizing services that are being targeted, but misuse of anonymizing

TorCP, starts a Tor instance and specifies the control port via the ControlPort option.  The value passed in is *not* picked up from torrc but is the one specified in the GUI.
    If you change the control port in the torrc file, you also have to change it in the TorCP GUI.  Then restart TorCP.

You've misunderstood and I should have been more clear.
I sent the email as I assumed that you might have changed the Control Port as well as the ORPort (which is what I had done when I manually edited the torrc file).  Assuming that you changed the ControlPort you'd have to change it in both the GUI & the torrc file.  If you *didn't* initially change the control port through the torrc file, leave TorCP at its default value (i.e. ignore my initial recommendation).
The ORPort, DirPort & Control Port are all different settings and not directly related to each other.  The Control Port is used by TorCP to control Tor.
