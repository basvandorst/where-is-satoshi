@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy seems to connect to the same exit 
You could run TorBirdy through its own instance of the tor client software, with a separate socks port.
This would avoid many of the issues you're trying to work around in b) and c), as TorBirdy could happily send NEWNYM to its own client instance all it liked. There is a slightly increased network load involved in running two instances, and there could be security implications of running separate tor clients - but mainly if their connections are distinguishable.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Onionoo HS Added 
Here are some ideas off the top of my head.
There may be security implications to these which I haven't considered.
* A HS Mirror of the torproject website, particularly git, source, binary distributions
Potentially useful for people who don't want to connect to the tor website, even via an exit.
* A HS equivalent to pastebin, or, possibly, 0bin (pastes are encrypted while stored, key is in URL, JavaScript (ugh) decrypts locally)
* A HS where people can post documents or images or videos
* A HS that will mirror and archive a single URL, potentially repeating the archiving on a schedule, like the internet archive.
* A HS that simply performs a speed test and reports the results to the user
* Do we have a single-page dashboard status for the overall tor network?
For example, x/y authorities signed consensus, z bandwidth, trends, ?
This would be a useful part of globe/atlas, but also as a HS.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why is 'Wgm' (middle-relay-for-guard weight) not 
This is intended to be the weighting for bridge relays, which are non-flagged nodes in the guard position.
(There's a comment in the source code about it.)

@_subject: [tor-talk] 100-Foot Overview on Tor 
Hi Tom,
Some further feedback:
Page 20:
Can you explain why you say that consensuses are valid for 24 hours, and not 3 hours?
Page 113:
I think there are 3 relays between the client and introduction point, not 2.
In new_route_len(), each circuit with an endpoint chosen by another relay gets an extra hop, and the hidden service chooses the introduction point, not the client.
I could be wrong about this - the path code has a few special cases that I haven't quite got my head around.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Friendly LAN bridge -- bad idea? 
The standard way of achieving this is to have multiple Tor browsers configured to connect via SOCKS to a shared Tor client on the LAN. This client has one set of connections, descriptors and caches, and 1-3 guards. This saves bandwidth and connections.
However, there is a small risk of increased linkability via timing attacks on a shared hidden service cache - one user gets a hidden service faster if another user has recently used it.
See There is also the risk of non-encrypted SOCKS connections being observed on your LAN. However, any unencrypted connections could be observed between the Tor exit and website anyway.
There may be other security implications of a shared Tor client. However, in my understanding, the loss of a guard node with a shared Tor bridge has known serious security implications.
Also, the increase in outgoing connections from a local bridge could very likely make your issue with the number of outgoing connections worse, not better. This depends on the number of Tor users you have - a bridge could make a connection to each of up to 5000 relays - do you have 1000 users using Tor simultaneously?

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor-talk Digest, Vol 52, Issue 18 
I want to correct earlier advice about trading separate external guards per client for a single bridge for all clients:
* in either case, network-level observers will know that people at your institution use Tor
* if your local bridge is compromised, all your users could be de-anonymised; if a guard is compromised, one of your users could be de-anonymised. So using a bridge would be like assigning the same guard to all the users at your institution, reducing the chances that one person is using a compromised guard, at the cost of having you all de-anonymised at once if that happens to your bridge.
Tor uses guards for this very reason - it's better to have a very small chance of having all connections compromised, than a large chance of having some connections compromised.
If your threat model includes government or institutional log or monitoring requests, that's worth considering, too.
It really depends how resistant your local bridge is to compromise, institutional, and legal pressure.
Aggregating Tor traffic can be great for privacy - "no, we know you traced it back here, but can't tell you who it was", but only if you avoid logging connections between the clients and the bridge. So make sure (detailed) logging is turned off on any clients, intermediate routers or firewalls, and on the bridge itself.

@_subject: [tor-talk]  tor 0.2.8.5-rc connecting to 18.0.0.1 
You're seeing this firewall warning due to a bugfix we released in Tor 0.2.8.
Tor clients protect your anonymity across different networks by changing some details when your IP address changes. When the platform-specific functions for finding your local IP address fail, we now do an extra check to see if we can find your IP address.
I've just commented on  , here's an excerpt:
Tor clients generate a new SSL certificate each time their IP address changes - this makes sure they can't be tracked across different  networks. (See client_check_address_changed for details.)
Tor uses two methods to find the address, GetAdaptersAddresses and the "UDP socket hack": asking the machine the local address of a UDP socket. For the hack to work, the socket has to be associated with a public IP address. Tor never sends data on the socket, it's entirely safe to block it with your firewall. Tor's just using it to check if your local address has changed.
In this case, it's likely that GetAdaptersAddresses failed to return any addresses, and to the UDP socket hack is being used to find the client IP address. To confirm this, please check the info-level logs for messages like:
Unable to load iphlpapi.dll
Unable to obtain pointer to GetAdaptersAddresses
GetAdaptersAddresses failed (result:
It would be great if a Windows dev could update the code in get_interface_addresses_win32 to correctly find the IP address on newer  systems. (We really, really need help from developers who can program on Windows!)
But this fix is not urgent. As far as I can tell, Tor is functioning as designed to make sure that users can't be linked when they change IP addresses. (Even though GetAdaptersAddresses isn't working.)

@_subject: [tor-talk]  Tor relay and IPv6 
We're working on better IPv6 client support in 0.2.8.
In 0.2.8, clients assume that the IPv6 DirPort is the same as the IPv4 DirPort.
This isn't ideal, but it does seem to work well in testing.

@_subject: [tor-talk] [tor-dev] Need to know if this is a bug 
From the Tor manual page:
" TransPort requires OS support for transparent proxies, such as BSDs' pf or Linux's IPTables."
It's disabled because there's no Windows transparent proxy implementation in Tor. That's likely because Windows has no OS support for transparent proxies.
You might be looking for VirtualAddrNetworkIPv4 or VirtualAddrNetworkIPv6, which is a non-transparent proxy, as it requires the network's IP addresses to be reconfigured.
Alternately, some combination of DNSPort and SOCKSPort is another non-transparent proxy option for applications with SOCKS proxy support.
Oh, and please don't cross-post to multiple lists. Answering on tor-dev and tor-talk so people know the question has been answered.

(Hi, tor-onions is a mailing list for operators of tor onion services to discuss configuring and running those services.
I've sent your email on to tor-talk, where you might be able to get further help.)
You need to use an email client that can use a SOCKS Proxy, and configure it to connect to Tor's SOCKSPort, which for Tor Browser is 127.0.0.1:9150, and for the system tor service (if you have one installed) 127.0.0.1:9050.
You should also use a PGP capable email client, and encrypt your email using the PGP provided.
(Unless, of course, that is your PGP key.)
