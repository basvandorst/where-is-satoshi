@_subject: [tor-talk] running a stable exit node on a Raspberry Pi B+ (can it 
I'm running a brand new US exit node on a dedicated B+ model Raspberry Pi server (relay nickname:
sonsorolDotNet ) configured per all the guides and running the reduced exit policy.
Trying to avoid being one of the new folks who obsess about flag status but  the relay lost the Stable flag sometime yesterday despite being up and running nonstop. I want to make sure it's not because I've tuned badly or because the B+ server is underpowered for what it needs to do.
Tried to set torrc conservatively at first for bandwidth:
The 'arm' utility says average up/down traffic is 1Mb/sec
Log data:
The only interesting system log entry recently:
Looking for pointers/tips/data on:
1. Can the raspberry pi B+ handle exit relay duties or is it potentially 2. Best logging/debug tips to dive into stability or connection issues with the tor service?
3. raspberrian or torcc tuning tips from people with similar setups

Much appreciated! Oddly enough the standard tools don't seem to show the rPi server struggling much at all  tor seems to take 7-20% of cpu-- running 'arm' seems to add an equal amount of load as the tor daemon itself. I'm actually thinking that running 'arm' constantly in a terminal status window may be bogging down the rPi but I'd like to figure out some logging/debug magic to 'prove' to myself that I've got an underwhelming box.
If I can trace performance problems to the rPi I'll happily swap in another dedicated box as a replacement.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Running a Tor node on a Rasberry Pi 
I'm running a tor exit on a very new Raspberry Pi B+ node and I just posted a message about it here 2 days ago wondering if it was perhaps under powered for the job.
Here are my quick thoughts:
1: I'm still trying to prove if the Pi is underpowered. I got the 'stable' flag back and now I'm starting to think it was either a glitch or perhaps the Pi can't handle dual duty running both Tor and the arm monitoring tool 24x7. Load goes down appreciably when I quit 'arm'.  The node has earned stable/exit/valid/fast/hs2dir etc. flags but it's only been online for a short time. One reason I think it may still be underpowered is that it's averaging about 1Mb/sec up and down despite my bandwidth limit settings being quite a bit higher. If the Pi turns out to be underpowered I'll put new hardware in
For your other questions
- It's very easy to get a distribution running on the Pi. Just look at  -- there is an installer image linked off of that site --  if you drop it onto your flash card the system will boot, install and auto configure itself all automatically via DHCP with no human interaction. About 12 minutes after you power the thing on you have a usable debian based system
- I could not easily find/use the debs that everybody talked about so I just built tor from source. It was trivially easy to do and built without errors
Long story short -- getting a usable distribution on the PI is easy, compiling Tor on the Pi is easy and my only longer term worry is that the hardware itself is not powerful enough for my own particular use case (tor exit node on a somewhat decent business-class broadband circuit).

@_subject: [tor-talk] ConnLimit issues with tor-0.2.7.2-alpha 
A failed UPS took down my little tor exit node running Raspbian linux on a Rasberry Pi 2 Model B so I decided to move from -stable to the latest However I'm having issues getting it to operate. I keep seeing this as the last log entry:
[warn] ConnLimit must be at least 32. Failing.
.. despite setting ConnLimit to 1024 in torrc and testing the OS via "ulimit -H -n" I still see the "Failing" message as the last updated line in tor notices.log
Anyone else see this? The docs seem light on this argument except to say "you probably never need to fiddle with this ..."

With that philosophy of yours maybe you'd be better off running an unlisted bridge ("bridge relay") ? Those seem aimed squarely at helping people evade government censorship and national firewalls. May be more close to the type of service you'd like to be providing ?

+1 for creating a tor-opentalk list if we need to satisfy the keyboard philosophers, communal fetishists and other interesting characters who need an audience to preen/preach in front of. Although I did find the the original start of this thread to be pretty interesting.
Like many others lurking here I prefer the current signal:noise ratio. Here's hoping for more posts about bad-exit nodes popping up and other interesting technical, design, usage and optimization discussions.

I run an exit node on a raspberry pi 2 just fine, 'arm' reports that it's pushed 2.4TB over the last 90 days.
The previous B+ model also worked OK but the '2' model does more with less load.

Because his response was helpful, earnest and legit?
It is a fairly common security practice for privacy minded people to walk into a store and purchase with cash a laptop from a random store so as to minimize the potential that the device was intercepted and interfered with in-transit (as the NSA has done with machines and cisco network gear).
The stuff you believe you are infected with is generally considered a valuable asset and is not disseminated promiscuously for risk that it will be discovered, analyzed and publicly exposed -- when they do deploy that stuff it's targeted at specific networks, systems, people and groups -- a random cash purchase of a new PC is a helpful and legit suggestion and your response to people trying to be helpful is not going to encourage additional responses.

Hi Janos,
If your computer was taken over by ransomware that encrypted your files then you are yelling at the wrong people. The "tor people" had nothing to do with this.
You are the 2nd person this week to contact the list about this. The first person had no backup/restore capability - at least it sounds like you got most of your stuff back via dropbox.

Quick reply ...
  - I run a tor exit node with a raspberry PI 2 model B. The prior generation struggled a bit to run under load but the 2B works fine
- Experience has been fantastic; tor builds and run just fine from source and my only outages were upstream or power related over the last year

Hi Jerry
Bad news I'm afraid. From that email you posted it looks like your computer has been hijacked by ransomware and all (or most of your files) are encrypted and will only be unlocked if you pay a ransom to the criminal gang.
This is a very common thing (search google for 'ransomeware' or whatever). It's a big problem.  In the past the gangs had made technical mistakes and there were some solutions posted on the net as to how to unlock the files. Sadly the recent round of ransomware tends to be good enough such that there is no real solution other than:
(1) Paying the ransom and getting the key to unlock your files
(2) Not paying the ransom, wiping your computer and restoring from a safe backup
Even police departments have been nailed by this, and yes, they paid the ransom to the criminal game
This has nothing to do with Microsoft, Mozilla or even this mailing list You were directed to Tor because the one of the websites the criminals want you to connect (the one ending in ".onion") is  only visible as a hidden service on the  Tor network
All of this happened because you let malware on your computer and it was able to take over (again, not necessarily your fault depending on the attack vector ...) . This may not be the only thing you should be afraid of - as these criminals often install other software on the system including software that may be monitoring what you type (to steal passwords) or other personal info.
There are no easy answers or painless solutions if the email is real and your files are locked by ransomeware. You either need to pay the criminals or accept the lost of your files (and then wipe and rebuild your computer with a higher level of security)

It's sorta disgusting to see the creep defenders come out in force on this list - especially the ones who talk big about anti-establishment stuff and post anonymously from privacy friendly ISPs who suddenly and magically have decided to start proclaiming their love for the rule of law and the need to stay silent until "real proof and evidence is provided". How convenient.
The only sorta good thing is that our little community here appears to mirror the tech community at large when it comes to handling claims regarding abusive personalities and harassment. The behavior exhibited here is the norm, not the exception, minus the tor-specific caveat that everything here, always, is a government conspiracy in some way shape or Got my fingers crossed that the more sensible and rational members of this list are staying silent as they often do when the oddballs come to My $.02 of course since everyone else has been so free with theirs

One small upside at least -- I'll selfishly admit that having a /redpill type pop up to excrete rants about "SJWs" did allow me to win a small bet.

I'm indifferent to the full cut and paste but welcome the posting of URLs and stories as more and more people come forward with names attached.
It's a counterbalance to the folk who vehemently claim that the accusations are an 'anonymous smear job' or state actor conspiracy --  especially the ones venting about the lack of names attached to stories. Now named accounts are starting to come out. It's important and on-topic for the -talk list at least.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor is anti-censorship software 
Seriously?  I spent some time trying to parse Juan's various messages yesterday to try to understand his point of view ... if you remove all of the insults and snide remarks the only concrete position I could discern was that he was legit upset over the marketing/PR approach of the Tor project. He wants the Tor project to do better messaging to make it clear that Tor can't protect anyone who may be facing an adversary with nation-state levels of technical resources. He feels strongly that the project should not advertise or promise "anonymity" given that it's pretty clear now that someone with significant resources and technical assets can de-cloak individual Tor users who catch their attention.
I actually sort of agree with that argument but sadly it was lost amidst a deluge of venomous words - the same sort of aggressive "you are all just useful idiots of the DOD/NSA" word salad stuff that causes people to hit the delete key right away. And 100% a contribution to worsening signal-to-noise ratio on this list.
Beyond suggesting that the project do better PR/Marketing about the real levels of privacy/anonymity offered I can't think of any other useful point raised. Everything else was just a rehash of what you hear from people who think the projects origin, backers and developers make it unsuitable for use by anyone at any time. Not new and not interesting at My $.02 of course

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is tor server now to heavy for a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B ? 
I've been running a US exit node for years now and got kinda smug about my uptime  figures. It's nice to have the stable flag, heh.
However for the past 6 months or so I've been getting an embarrassing amount of 'node down' alerts from the weather service
It's always an OOM error for tor.  95% of the time I can ssh into the box and reboot it and all is well but there have been 4 cases in the last month where the box was so unresponsive I had to pull the power plug.  That is a hassle when I'm traveling and makes my uptime numbers even worse.
Right now I have a script that reboots the Pi in /etc/cron.daily that seems (so far) to be keeping the system online but I'm starting to think that my little Pi is now too underpowered for what it needs to do. Thinking of getting a new Pi or possibly a beefier option like a Nuc or Raspberry Pi 2 Model B Rev 1.1
ARMv7 Processor rev 5 (v7l)
923mb RAM / 1gb swap
For tor releases I usually switch between the current GA release and one of the prerelease alphas.
Is this box too anemic for modern Tor serving as an exit node? Thanks!
