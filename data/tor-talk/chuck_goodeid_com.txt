for you.
script for Tor doing an 'su' to the $toruser and then passing the user and group options when starting Tor. I removed the user and group options when Tor is started and it now works fine. It seems the $toruser does not have sufficient permissions to change the programs group.

installed, so I installed 'libevent-devel-1.4.8-2mdv2009.1.i586' and 'tor-0.2.1.15-rc' configure and make were successful.
