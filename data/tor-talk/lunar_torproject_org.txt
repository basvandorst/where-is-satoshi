Hi Jon,
A few of your assumptions look incorrect. Here's some of my
Jon Tullett:
NoScript itself is enabled in the Tor Browser Bundle, configured to
allow JavaScript globally. This configuration already adds protection
from XSS and clickjacking attacks. It also allows users who wants it to
disable JavaScript globally to do so with only two clicks.
Users of the Tor Browser Bundle are identified as such. What we want is
to have as little differences as possible between two different TBB
users. Having JavaScript globaly enabled or not is irrelevant on that
matter, as long as the configuration is the same for as many TBB users
as possible.
Having JavaScript enabled is also about exposing users to a web that
works for them. When was the last time you have tried to surf with
JavaScript disabled? How many websites were not working as you would
expect them to? Do you have any experience in training users to
enable/disable JavaScript on a per site basis?
Also, I suggest you take a look at the following paper:
It shows that JavaScript is not the only thing than can be
targeted to attack users. Disabling JavaScript will not prevent every
possible attacks.
I have a hard time thinking of interesting answers to your questions
given all of the above.

Tor Weekly News                                        August 14th, 2013
Welcome to the seventh issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter
that covers what is happening in the fast-paced Tor community.
New Tor Browser Bundle releases
Last week events [15] sparked a good amount of discussions on Tor
Browser usability.  Several discussions on tor-talk and in other places
revolved around the idea that ?JavaScript should be disabled by
default?. scarp wrote a good summary?[16] on why it is not so simple: ?I
understand that JavaScript was enabled globally in the Tor Browser
Bundle for usability reasons as well as to prevent browser
fingerprinting. [?] If the torproject were to disable it by default,
that would not ensure that users are protected in the future by similar
methods. Sites can be written in a way that if you do not allow
JavaScript they simply won?t work at all. If I was writing an exploit
I?d do this to frustrate users so hopefully they enable JavaScript and
accept my exploit.? Roger Dingledine also improved?[17] the relevant
question in Tor FAQ?[18].
One possible solution to satisfy contradicting requirements would be to
add a ?security slider??[19] that would allow users to easily trade off
web compatibility over security. The slider would have three or four
different positions that would gradually deactivate more and more
features of the browser. One has to understand that the ?most secure?
should probably disable loading of any pictures. This also impacts the
Tor Browser anonymity set but this is probably a trade off that can be
afforded given the actual size of the Tor Browser user base.
scarp had also pined another big usability problem related to updating:
?This exploit wasn?t new. [?] Users running the latest Tor Browser
Bundle didn?t have any issues as their browsers had been patched. It is
inappropriate for a web browser to not be automatically updated.? Nick
Mathewson went back?[20] on the latest plan that was discussed during
the last summer dev. meeting?[21] to simply build upon Firefox update
mechanism. The next step is to do a proper review. Hopefully, given it
is ?mature and widespread? and has been ?proven to update Firefox?, we
will not ?run screaming for the hills? when looking at the
On a more general level, an unexpected comment came from Brendan Eich
(Mozilla?s chief technology officer) on Twitter?[22]: ?Maybe we should
just adopt, support, and bundle Tor in Firefox...?  David Dahl
subsequently opened a bug report in Mozilla?s tracker to discuss a way
forward?[23]. Mike Perry commented on a thread?[24] on the
liberationtech mailing list: ?In short, I am excited by this news, and I
look forward to improving our communication and cooperation with Mozilla
on this front.?

Tails 2013 summit
On Monday, Nick Mathewson robbed everyone of his ?I?m a little teapot?
performance?[32] by releasing the following three new proposals:
Proposal 219?[33] has been written a year ago by Ondrej Mikle. It is
currently at draft stage. Its goal is to make Tor support any DNS query
type and also support full DNSSEC resolution. The latter is important as
it provides ?protection against DNS cache-poisoning attacks? but is made
tricky given a routine hostname resolution with DNSSEC ?can require
dozens of round trips across a circuit?.
In another draft proposal?[34], Nick Mathewson describes a plan for a
smooth transition from the current 1024-bit RSA keys used for router
identity and TLS links to Ed25519-SHA-512?[35] keys. Several small
details still have to be ironed out.  This proposal does not address
hidden service keys. They will have to be addressed in another proposal
once an agreement has been reached regarding the best crypto
Now that the ntor onionskin handshake?[37] has been implemented in
0.2.4, we could get better forward secrecy by having clients top sending
CREATE_FAST cells. Nick Mathewson has issued proposal 221?[38] to detail
the reasons and the implications of such change.
All these proposals are now up for discussions on the tor-dev mailing
  [32]?

Miscellaneous news
Below is a summary of some frequent questions received at the Tor help
desk this past week:
Users are frequently confused by the message they receive from GetTor.
Currently the Tor Browser Bundle is too large to send over GetTor, so
users instead receive three mirrors with a link to a page with all
available translations of the Tor Browser Bundle. Many users email the
help desk unsure of what this page means or which package they need.
A number of users asked whether or not they needed to disable JavaScript
in the Tor Browser Bundle. While the vulnerability in Firefox does not
affect the latest Tor Browser Bundle, disabling JavaScript globally will
reduce one?s risk of being affected by future JavaScript exploits. Users
were asked to choose for themselves between greater protection inside
the browser or a browsing experience with more functionality enabled.

Help Desk Roundup
Users experience confusion when trying to update the Tor Browser Bundle.
Users are not always aware that the Tor Browser Bundle does not have an
autoupdate function. Some users will download the latest release from
the Tor Project website, then ask ?Ok, what do I do now??. We recommend
closing the browser, then deleting one?s current Tor Browser folder
before unpacking the new download.
One person asked for help while using the Pirate Browser.
Torrent-sharing website The Pirate Bay released the Pirate Browser this
week as a fork of the Tor Browser Bundle. The Pirate Browser is not
endorsed or recommended by the Tor Project. It is unclear what the
advantages are compared to using the Tor Browser Bundle and no source
code is available.

I don't really understand why add extra complications and not directly
use the Tor Browser Bundle. Why is preventing you from using the bundled
Tor instance?
You can use tor-arm with the Tor Browser Bundle. Just issue
`arm -i 9151` on a command-line.
You should be able to set the environment variable `TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1`,
    TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1 ./start-tor-browser
Removing or adding add-ons from the Tor Browser might give to your own
browser a specific fingerprint.
Why would it be a problem?
Running two instances of the tor daemon on one system will not create a
Tor over Tor situation. There's just two distinct tor daemons. One
acting as an ?Onion Proxy?, the other as an ?Onion Router?.

Bridge? Intel processors, and 4) have no state file in their
DataDirectory (as would happen on first start). Users who generated
relay or hidden service identity keys in such a situation should discard
them and generate new ones.?

Welcome to the second issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter
meant to cover what is happening in the great Tor community.
First release candidate for Tor 0.2.4.x series
As Andrew Lewman wrote on Thursday, July 4th, ?over the past 24 hours
 has been unavailable due to excessive DNS
queries to the exitlist service. It seems there are a number of
individuals and companies with commercial products relying upon this
volunteer service. We finally hit the point where we couldn?t keep up
with the queries and simply disabled the service??[14].
At the time of writing, the service is again available, but the project
might ?take it down as needed without notice.?
?check.torproject.org? is no longer the homepage for Tails since January
of this year?[14]. The Tor Browser Bundle will also switch to a new
homepage in version 3, currently in alpha stage?[16].
Other software or services that depend on check.torproject.org should
either migrate away or run their own version using the source code for
the web page?[17]. It is supported by a database of running exit
nodes that can be queried through DNS?[18].
If you wish to help, one need is to make it easier for third parties to
get their own ?check? service running. This means getting the service
more modular?[19] and improving TorDNSEL?[20] or finishing TorBEL?[21].
Someone must also write documentation that is easy to follow.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Mozilla Persona and Tor 
I am exhuming this thread after some discussions in meatspace with one
developer of Mozilla Persona.
Mike Perry:
That API is currently provided by a JavaScript library. See ?Step 1? of
the Quick Setup page:
The technical reason is key rollovers. There is currently no way for
identity providers to advertise a new key. In case of compromise of
their private key, identity providers will have to wait for sites to
fetch a new one from the `.well-known/browserid` descriptor. The
expiration time is there to minimize the delay.
Clicking the ?Cancel? button or having zero certificates will send the
same result. So sites should not be able to determine if you have at
zero, one or more identity statements. (Except maybe by timing?)
(I am not sure I totally got this part in full.)
The idea is that once properly identified, a website would set a session
cookie as usual. If the session cookie is not expired but the cert
is, usage of the site will not be advertised to the identity provider.
If the session cookie is expired but the cert is not, login should
effectively happen without user interaction. If both are expired,
users will be prompted to authenticate with their identity provider as
If your identity provider is your email provider, it is likely that you
will check your email too. Using Tor should be enough prevent them to
know one's location.
Currently, the IdP descriptors have to be fetched by the authenticating
websites over CA-authenticated HTTPS. People working on Persona are
aware that this is far from ideal from a security point of view and
already had to patch several Persona implementation to make sure the
certs were properly verified.
Regarding privacy, the authenticating website does not announce itself
to the identity provider. It is only the IP address used to retrieve the
descriptor that could be used to identify the website. This means that
teaching websites to retrieve the IdP descriptors through Tor would
prevent IdP from knowing that these sites have been visited by one of
their users.
Another option would be to retrieve the IdP descriptors at regular
interval using cron or another mecanism. IdP would then have a constant
trace, with or without users logging in.
Hope that answers some questions. We can probably get other answers now
that contact has been made. :)

@_author: Lunar 
@_subject: [tor-talk] [tor-dev] Idea regarding active probing and 
(Moving the discussion to tor-talk as this is not directly related to
the code of Tor software or infrastructure.)
Lag Inimaineb:
This technical difficulty could be solved by using something like
sslh?[1]: ?sslh accepts connections on specified ports, and forwards
them further based on tests performed on the first data packet sent by
the remote client. Probes for HTTP, SSL, SSH, OpenVPN, tinc, XMPP are
implemented, and any other protocol that can be tested using a regular
expression, can be recognised.?
The problem is that if sslh can distinguish protocols that way, so could
DPI boxes. So it would need something a little more convoluted.
More or less. I remember reading about Iran throttling any encrypted
connection that lasted for more than 60 seconds. To a point that made
Tor actually unusable, IIRC.
Another related idea is called Telex?[2]. To sum it up, this is about
diverting seamlessly innocuous traffic at the network level. A censor
could then thus not differentiate from "normal responsesi". One
difference with your idea is that it does not require direct cooperation
from the Internet sites, but with network providers along the path.
I don't know if Telex has ever been deployed in practice.

Debian's policy is that the archive should not have duplicated code

@_subject: [tor-talk] Plans about Askbot? 
For the record, I share the concerns Moritz have raised about the move
to Stack Exchange.
Andrew Lewman:
I think this is a wise choice when it comes to money. But I also think
that the broader Tor community should specifically be given the chance
to work on these peripheral needs.
From what I have seen, when Runa goes to EuroPython to advertise Tor
projects to Python developers?[1] or when an hour is not long enough
for Jake and Roger to present all of the Tor ecosystem at 29C3?[2],
these talks result in people that really would like to help! Yet, they
often fail to find room to do so, because the tor daemon is a huge code
base, because the network problems are hard, because other issues
require a lot of expertise.
I have seen a few times people showing up and asking ?I would really
like to help Tor, but I only know about web development, is there
something I could do??. So far, it's been hard to answer. Atlas/Compass
are not necessarily easy to get into. But that wishlist for AskBot feels
just like the right way to engage web developers familiar with Python!
What I have in mind is not huge: a call for help on the blog, some
Twitter buzz, and some welcoming people on IRC. Given that AskBot has
an active upstream, the cost of interacting with volunteers should even
be pretty low for the Tor project.
One of the concern that was raised by Moritz is export capabilities of
Stack Exchange. How likely are we to switch to a self-hosted application
if it means losing data that had taken a lot of energy to assemble in
the first place?

@_author: Lunar 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Plans about Askbot? 
Runa A. Sandvik:
Moritz mentioned that we would not be able to migrate user/reputation.
As such Q&A websites have an important social component (karma, badges,
and so on), volunteers who would have invested time and energy to build
a good reputation could be turned away by loosing all their stats
Overall, I am not afrad of the import part: AskBot is free software.
It's getting data out of Stack Exchange that I am wondering about.
Looks like at least most data (except user logins, emails and passwords)
could be retrieved through , but it
looks a bit tedious to get a full export. Also, given there's a CAPTCHA,
I am not sure backups could be automated.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Are non-official projects welcome to Stackexchange 
Nick Mathewson:
For what it's worth, my answer was listed in the missing features for
  * Add a subsite feature:
    - a single login should allow to post on different subsites
    - a single user might have different credentials, karmas and badges
      in different subsites
    - allow to move questions between subsites (if allowed to do so)
    - subsites can be tied to one or more languages (see multilanguage)
Provided we had such thing, general Tor could be one subsite, and we
could have others for TorBirdy, Tails, Arm, Whonix?
I don't know if such a thing can be done with Stack Exchange.

tor 0.2.4.18-rc is out
It is often recommended to run Tails from a read-only medium in order to
prevent any malware to permanently mess with the system. ?CD is best,
but many devices these days don?t have an optical drive, and handling
CDs is not as convenient as a USB stick? wrote Moritz Bartl on
tor-talk [4].
It looks like one of the very few specific brand of USB sticks available
in Germany that had a proper hardware protection switch can no longer be
used to boot Tails. Moritz ended up contacting various Chinese
suppliers. ?Even there, the selection of sticks with write protection is
very limited? but eventually one model was found acceptable. Moritz
intend to re-sell a bulk of them at the upcoming 30C3 in Hamburg [5].

related articles in the press [18]. ?According to the website [19] the
last time there was a meaningful article about Tor was July 1st. This is
very far from the case.? If you want to help, just edit the wiki

browser to the point where it ?is good enough for Tails 0.22? [21].

  [21]   [22] Andreas Jonsson released [23] initial sandboxed version of the TBB 3.0
series which is ready for testing [24]. This security feature should
prevent an exploit from stealing user data : the Tor Browser will not be
allowed to execute any programs, nor will it be allowed to read or
modify data on disk except in the users ?downloads?-folder and its own
profile. The sandbox is currently only supported on OS X 10.9 ?but
making it work all the way down to 10.6 is not unlikely?.

It is also possible to some advanced magic around Postfix to avoid that.
The trick is to use a daemon, hooked up to Postfix using a tcp_table(5)
as transport_maps. Then for each mail that Postfix wants to deliver,
that daemon open up a new local port where traffic will be redirected
through Tor to the SMTP server. Postfix is told to use that local
address in order to deliver that particular email. Because that deamon
will be the one doing the MX lookup, it can query a DNS over TCP over
Tor to get the MX record.

Welcome to the sixteenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter
that covers what?s happening in the venerable Tor community.
Making hidden services more scalable and harder to locate
The Tor project wishes to expand its support channels to text-based
instant messaging as part of the Boisterous Otter?[11] project. Lunar
and Colin C. came up with a possible implementation?[12] based on the
XMPP protocol, Prosody?[13] for the server side, and Prodromus?[14] as
the basis for the web based interface.
This week, multiple people asked if Tor worked well on the Raspberry Pi.
Although the Tor Project does not have any documentation directed
specifically at the Raspberry Pi (yet!), the issue was raised on Tor?s
StackExchange page?[15]. Tor relay operators are encouraged to share
their experiences or ask for help on the tor-relays public mailing

Welcome to the seventeenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the guarding Tor community.
Tor?s anonymity and guards parameters
George Kadianakis posted a list of items that need work in the Hidden
Service area?[6]. Despite not being exhaustive, the list contains many
items that might help with upgrading the Hidden Service design, be it
around security, performance, guard issues or ?petname? systems.
Help and comments are welcome!

Usability issues in existing OTR clients
The Tor Help Desk continues to be bombarded with help requests from
users behind university proxies who cannot use ORPort bridges or the
Pluggable Transports Browser to circumvent their network?s firewall.
Although the cases are not all the same, bridges on port 443 or port 80
do not always suffice to circumvent such proxies.
Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) was released this week. One user
reported their Tor Browser Bundle behaving unusually after updating
their Ubuntu operating system. This issue was resolved by switching to
the Tor Browser Bundle 3. Another user asked when Tor APT repositories
would have packages for Saucy Salamander. Since then, packages for the
latest version of Ubuntu have been made available from the usual

There will never be enough. See ?Fix 4: We need to make the network

The Tor project encourages people to run relays and exit nodes.
The Tor Project does not run the Tor network. So it is no liable for
running exit nodes, as it does not run any exit nodes. But we try to
provide as much support as we can to the community of volunteers running
relays and exit nodes.
For tips on how to run an exit node, the following advices are still
relevant: Moritz Bartl drew on his experience with Zwiebelfreunde e.V. on how to
setup a non-profit to run exit nodes:
And there's quite a bunch of such organizations nowadays, and hopefully
more coming:
One way to contribute is to donate time or money to help these
organizations so they can run more or bigger exit relays.
Bridges are not listed publicly. See Tor's website for more details:

(Why the cross-post to tor-relays?)
I have to disagree here. While administrators who block Tor
indiscriminately cause pain to every Tor users, we should solve the
problem with education, not deception.
On the technical side, TorDNSEL should properly detect the IP address
used by exit nodes, so check.tpo should not report false negatives for
multihomed exits. Otherwise, either the node did not had time to be
tested, or there's a bug in TorDNSEL.
Being able to add an extra CAPTCHA for Tor clients or other proxy
services is a legitimate wish in face of abuses. Providing ways to do so
that work reliably is more likely to help with indiscriminate bans.

A few highlights from this year?s Google Summer of Code
Using the Tor Browser Bundle is still proving to be tricky for many
Ubuntu users who upgraded from Ubuntu 13.04 to 13.10. The commonly
reported error is that users cannot enter text in any of the browser?s
text fields, including the URL and search bars. So far this problem
appears to be resolved by removing ibus with apt-get before running the
Tor Browser. Users who need ibus can try running `export
GTK_IM_MODULE=xim`, as documented in Trac ticket   [11]?

that covers what is happening in the taut Tor community.
tor 0.2.4.17-rc is out
Not all new Tor users are computer programs! According to their latest
report?[42], Tails is now booted twice as much as it was six months ago
(from 100,865 to 190,521 connections to the security feed).
  [42] Thanks to Frenn vun der Enn?[43] for setting up a new mirror?[44] of the
Tor project website.
  [43]   [44] With the Google Summer of Code ending in two weeks, the students have
sent their penultimate reports: Kostas Jakeliunas for the
Searchable metrics archive?[45], Johannes F?rmann for EvilGenius?[46],
Hareesan for the Steganography Browser Extension?[47], and
Cristian-Matei Toader for Tor capabilities?[48].
  [45]   [46]   [47]   [48] Damian Johnson announced?[49] that he had completed the rewrite of
DocTor in Python?[50], ?a service that pulls hourly consensus
information and checks it for a host of issues (directory authority
outages, expiring certificates, etc). In the case of a problem it
notifies tor-consensus-health and we in turn give the authority
operator a heads up.?
  [49]   [50]   [51] Matt Pagan has migrated?[52] several Frequently-Asked Questions from the
wiki to the official Tor website?[53]. This should enable more users to
find the answers they need!
  [52]   [53] In his previous call for help to collect more statistics?[54], addressed
to bridge operators, George Kadianakis forgot to mention that an extra
line with ?ExtORPort 6669? needed to be added to the tor configuration
file?[55]. Make sure you do have it if you are running a bridge on the
tor master branch.
  [54]   [55] For the upgrade of tor to the 0.2.4.x series in Tails, a tester spotted
a regression while ?playing with an ISO built from experimental, thanks
to our Jenkins autobuilder??[56]. This marks a significant milestone in
the work on automated builds?[57] done by several members of the
Tails team in the course of the last year!
  [56]   [57] Tails? next ?low-hanging fruit? session will be on September 21st at
08:00 UTC?[58]. Mark the date if you want to get involved!
  [58] David Fifield gave some tips on how to setup a test infrastructure?[59]
for flash proxy?[60].
  [59]   [60] Marek Majkowski reported?[61] on how one can use his fluxcapacitor
tool?[62] to get a test Tor network started with Chutney?[63] ready in
only 6.5 seconds. A vast improvement over the 5 minutes he initially had
to wait?[64]!
  [61]   [62]   [63]   [64] Eugen Leitl drew attention?[65] to a new research paper which aims to
analyze the content and popularity of Hidden Services by Alex Biryukov,
Ivan Pustogarov, and Ralf-Philipp Weinmann from the University of
  [65]   [66] Tor Help Desk roundup
Tor is about protecting everyone?s freedom and privacy. There are many
ways to help?[69] but getting involved in such a busy community can be
daunting. Here?s a selection of tasks on which one could get started:
Get tor to log the source of control port connections?[70]. It would
help in developing controller applications or libraries (like Stem?[71])
to know which program is responsible for a given access to the control
facilities of the tor daemon. Knowledge required: C programming, basic
understanding of network sockets.
Diagnose what is currently wrong with Tor Cloud images?[72]. Tor
Cloud?[73] is an easy way to deploy bridges and it looks like the
automatic upgrade procedure caused problems. Let?s make these virtual
machines useful again for censored users. Knowledge required: basic
understanding of Ubuntu system administration.

Tor Project website redesign takes two steps forward
An extensive guide to hacking on Tor Browser was posted?[26] to the Tor
Project?s wiki by Mike Perry. Among other things, it covers the
browser?s build instructions, design principles and testing procedures,
as well as a summary of how browser team members organize and
communicate. If you?d like to get involved in Tor Browser development,

Nicholas Hopper followed up?[27,28] on George Kadianakis? research on
switching to a single guard. He used Aaron Johnson?s TorPS simulator to
find out the ?typical? bandwidth for a client. The conclusions match
George?s: a single guard and a bandwidth cutoff of 2 Mbit/s would
improve over the current situation. George subsequently sent an initial
draft proposal?[29] to start the formal process.

Tor Weekly News                                         April 16th, 2014
Welcome to the fifteenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
New beta version of Tor Browser 3.6
The ?Heartbleed? issue forces system administrators to consider private
keys of network-facing applications affected by the bug as compromised.
As Tor has no shortage of private keys in its design?[5], a serious
number of new keys has to be generated.
Roger Dingledine prompted?[6] relay operators to get new identity keys,
?especially from the big relays, and we?ll be happier tolerating a
couple of bumpy days while the network recovers?. Switching to a new
relay identity key means that the relay is seen as new?[7] to the
authorities again: they will lose their Guard status and bandwidth
measurement. It seems that a number of operators followed the advice, as
the network lost around 1 Gbit/s of advertised capacity between April
7th and April 10th?[8].
For a brighter future if such massive RSA1024 relay key migration is
ever again in order, Nick Mathewson wrote proposal 230?[9]. The proposal
describes a mechanism for relays to advertise their old identity to
directory authorities and clients.
Directory authorities can currently tie a relay?s nickname to its
identity key with the Named flag. That feature proved to be less helpful
than it seemed, and can subject its users to impersonation attacks. As
relays switch to new identity keys, those who keep the same name will
lose their Named flag for the next six months. So now seems?[10] a good
time to ?throw out the Named and Unnamed flags entirely?. Sebastian Hahn
acted on the idea and started a draft proposal?[11].
How should potentially compromised relays which have not switched to a
new key be handled? On April 8th, grarpamp observed?[12] that more than
3000 relays had been restarted ? hopefully to use the fixed version of
OpenSSL. It is unknown how many of those relays have switched to a new
key since. Andrea Shepard has been working on a survey?[13] to identify
them. What is known though are relays that are unfortunately still
vulnerable. Sina Rabbani has set up a visible list for guards and
exits?[14]. To protect Tor users, directory authority operators have
started to reject descriptors for vulnerable relays?[15].
The identity keys for directory authorities are kept offline. But they
are used to certify medium-term signing keys. Roger Dingledine?s
analysis?[16] reports ?two (moria1 and urras) of the directory
authorities were unaffected by the openssl bug, and seven were
At the time of writing, five of the seven affected authorities had new
signing keys. In the meantime, Nick and Andrea have been busy writing
code to prevent the old keys from being accepted by Tor clients?[17].
Changing the relay identity keys of the directory authorities has not
been done so far ?because current clients expect them to be at their
current IP:port:fingerprint and would scream in their logs and refuse to
connect if the relay identity key changes?. The specification of the
missing piece of code to allow a smoother transition has been written by
Nick Mathewson in proposal?231?[18].
Finally, hidden service operators are also generating new keys?[19].
Unfortunately, this forces every user of the service to update the
address in their bookmarks or configuration.
As Roger summarized it: ?fun times?.

Welcome to the thirty-first issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
Tor and the RELAY_EARLY traffic confirmation attack
Anthony G. Basile announced a new release of tor-ramdisk, an i686 or
x86_64 uClibc-based micro Linux distribution whose only purpose is to
host a Tor server. Version 20140801?[24] updates Tor to version
0.2.4.23, and the kernel to 3.15.7 with Gentoo?s hardened patches.
  [24]:?
meejah has announced?[25] a new command-line application. carml?[26] is
a versatile set of tools to ?query and control a running Tor?. It can do
things like ?list and remove streams and circuits; monitor stream,
circuit and address-map events; watch for any Tor event and print it (or
many) out; monitor bandwidth; run any Tor control-protocol command; pipe
through common Unix tools like grep, less, cut, etcetera; download TBB
through Tor, with pinned certs and signature checking; and even spit out
and run xplanet configs (with router/circuit markers)!? The application
is written in Python and uses the txtorcon?library?[27]. meejah
describes it as early-alpha and warns that it might contain ?serious,
anonymity-destroying bugs?. Watch out!

The Citizen Lab Summer Institute?[39] took place at the University of
Toronto from July 28 to 31. The event brought together policy and
technology researchers who focus on Internet censorship and measurement.
A lot of great work was presented including but not limited to a
proposal to measure the chilling effect, ongoing work to deploy
Telex?[40], and several projects to measure censorship in different
countries. Some Tor-related work was also presented: Researchers are
working on understanding how the Tor network is used for political

There are many reasons. I guess patches would be happily discussed if
you had some. SOCKS5 supports UDP, TransPort could be made to support
UDP too. Then there's circuit handling and session tracking?? the
connection is never opened or closed with UDP.
But then, the underlying connections between relays are still going to
be TCP. Previous research on switching to datagram designs:

       unauthorized clients. Only clients that are listed here are
       authorized to access the hidden service. Valid client names are 1
       to 19 characters long and only use characters in A-Za-z0-9+-_ (no
       spaces). If this option is set, the hidden service is not
       accessible for clients without authorization any more. Generated
       authorization data can be found in the hostname file. Clients need
       to put this authorization data in their configuration file using
       HidServAuth.

Griffin Boyce:
Using Mumble over Tor worked out on the few occasions I've tried it.
So sadly, this is a misconception.
My latest attempt to manually configure a recent Firefox to go through
Tor and use the WebRTC on  failed. I had a
firewall denying all connections not routed through Tor.
I have also not been able to make Jitsi (2.4) work in the same setup.

Velkomin to the eighth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
News from the 2014 Winter Developers? Meeting in Reykjav?k
Karsten Loesing announced?[14] an IRC meeting to discuss the next steps
for the rewrite of Tor Weather, to be held on the OFTC  channel
on Wednesday 26th February at 18:00 UTC. ?Topics include reporting
progress made since the last meeting two weeks ago, making plans for the
next week, and possibly turning this project into a GSoC project?.
  [14]:?
Nick Mathewson announced?[15] the start of a weekly Tor developer?s
meeting, to be held on the OFTC  channel, ?for working on the
program ?tor?. (This won?t cover all the other programs developed under
the Tor umbrella.)?.
  [15]:?
The Tails developers will be holding?[16] their next contributors?
meeting on the OFTC  channel at 9pm UTC on March 5th;
?everyone interested in contributing to Tails is welcome.?.
  [16]:?
Andrew Lewman submitted his monthly status report for January?[17], and
also wrote up a report of his involvement in the recent Boston
  [17]:?
  [18]:?
Alexander Dietrich published?[19] a multi-instance init script for Tor
(?basically the current official init script and torservers.net?s
?instances? mechanism frankensteined together?, in Alexander?s words) in
response to a recent discussion on tor-relays?[20].
  [19]:?
  [20]:?
Responding to a message from someone interested in writing a DNS-based
pluggable transport, George Kadianakis suggested?[21] several ways in
which the existing obfsproxy code could be reworked to accommodate this.
  [21]:?
George also recommended?[22] that operators of obfs3 or ScrambleSuit
bridges install the python-gmpy package on their relays, as it can
significantly increase the speed of some cryptographic operations.
  [22]:?
Jens Kubieziel wrote up?[23] the results of an attempt to determine
whether the recent transition between the TAP and NTor handshake
protocols is connected to some users? reports of hidden service
  [23]:?
Max Jakob Maass published?[24] the preliminary results of a test in
which the RIPE Atlas measurement API was used to retrieve the SSL
certificate of torproject.org from as many countries as possible in
order to detect attempted attacks or censorship, and wondered whether it
might be worth running such a test on a regular basis.
  [24]:?
With regard to a coming redesign of the ?Volunteers? section on the Tor
Project?s website, Moritz Bartl wrote up a list of proposed volunteer
categories that was the fruit of a brainstorming session at the Tor
developers? meeting, and asked for suggestions?[25] of ?obvious? missing
sections, as well as ?acceptably-licensed? graphics that could serve as
icons for each category.
  [25]:?
Nathan Freitas wrote?[26] from the Tor developers? meeting with a
request for help in compiling ?user stories? on the Tor wiki: that is,
stories of the form ?a [type of Tor user] wants to [some feature of a
Tor app] in order to [some reason related to security, privacy,
etc]??[27]. If you have any to add, please write them up on the
dedicated wiki page!
  [26]:?
  [27]:?
Yawning Angel sent out?[28] a draft of a proposal to ?extend the SOCKS5
protocol when communicating with pluggable transports to allow passing
more per-bridge meta-data to the transport and returning more meaningful
connection failure response codes back to Tor?.
  [28]:?
Josh Ayers wrote?[29] to the Tor-ramdisk list suggesting possible ways
to ensure that sufficient entropy is available to the kernel by the time
tor-ramdisk generates its long-term keys.

Welcome to the first issue for the year 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the
weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the impressive Tor
community. The tor-news mailing list has reached a thousand subscribers.
Thanks for following us!
Tor at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress
Anthony G. Basile released version 20131230 of Tor-ramdisk?[33]?? a
uClibc-based micro Linux distribution whose only purpose is to host a
Tor server ? with an updated Linux kernel and Tor 0.2.4.20.
  [33]?
Gregory Maxwell started discussion on how to improve Hidden Services key
management?[34]: ?It would be preferable if it were possible to have a
HS master key which was kept _offline_ which could be use to authorize
use for some time period and/or revoke usage.? As Nick Mathewson pointed
out?[35], the timing is right and such issues have a chance to be
addressed with the current redesign process?[36,37].
  [34]?
  [35]?
  [36]?
  [37]?
The Tails team has announced: ?The MAC address spoofing feature is ready
for testing. This feature prevents geographical tracking of your network
devices (and by extension, you) by randomizing their MAC addresses.?
Testing on a variety of hardware is now needed, give it a try?[38]!
  [38]?
The next Tails contributor online meeting?[39] will be held January 9th
on the IRC channel  (OFTC) at 21:00 UTC.
  [39]?
The ?test/rjb-migration? branch has been merged into the Tails
development tree?[40]. It should now be fairly straightforward to run
the automated test suite on a Debian Wheezy system.
  [40]?
The Tor Project?s website has gained another new mirror, thanks PW?[41]!

Johannes F?rmann asked?[42] the relay operators community to review a
short documentation?[43] on how to run multiple Tor processes on one

Tor Weekly News                                       January 15th, 2014
Welcome to the second issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
Orbot 13 is out
The Tor network would not exist without all its volunteers?? currently
more than 3,000 all around the world?? who run the 5,000+ relays
anonymizing our connections.
Tor Weather is one of these small services run by the Tor Project that
is meant to make the life of relay operators easier. It can warn them
when their relay is down or when a new version of tor is available? and
when they can receive the rewarding t-shirt?[11]. Unfortunately, Tor
Weather has been unmaintained for quite a while, and issues have
accumulated?[12] over time.
Karsten Loesing has sent a call for help?[13] with suggestions on how
the code can be simplified and improved. Abhiram Chintangal and Norbert
Kurz have already stated their interests. Coordination is done through
the tor-dev mailing list?[14] and a design wiki page?[15]. Join them if
you are up to some Python hacking or spiffing up the web interface!

More monthly status reports for December 2013
The Tails team has put out a call for testing the first release
candidate for Tails 0.22.1?[20]. The new version will bring several
bugfixes, an updated kernel, and many improvements to the upgrader
  [20]?
Directory authorities are in the process?[21] of upgrading their
directory signing key to RSA 2048. This has been done for five out of
nine authorities?[22]. The changes might result in some temporary error
messages in logs of Tor relays, as it did?[23] when ?gabelmoo??[24]
changed its key on January 11th.
  [21]?
  [22]?
  [23]?
  [24]?
Nicolas Vigier has sent a proposal?[25] about replacing the current
Gitian-based build system for the Tor Browser Bundle by a system based
on burps?[26]. Nicolas also worked on a prototype?[27] to go with his
  [25]?
  [26]?
  [27]?
Nick Mathewson mentioned?[28] that the ?Sniper Attack? paper?[29] by Rob
Jansen, Florian Tschorsch, Aaron Johnson, and Bj?rn Scheuermann was now
available. This paper describes serious Denial of Service attacks
through memory exhaustion. The issue is fixed ?thanks to advice from
the paper?s authors, in Tor 0.2.4.x and later?.
  [28]?
  [29]?
In order to prevent attacks?[30] on hidden services based on predicting
which directory will be used, directory authorities need to periodically
produce shared unpredictable random strings. To address the issue,
Nicholas Hopper has sent ?a threshold signature-based proposal for a
shared RNG??[31], now up for reviews.
  [30]?
  [31]?
The next session of low-hanging fruits for Tails will happen?[32] on
February 8th in the  IRC channel OFTC at 10:00 CET.
  [32]?
Thanks to stalkr.net?[33], Maki Hoshisawa?[34] and cYbergueRrilLa
AnonyMous NeXus?[35] for running new mirrors of the Tor Project website.
  [33]?
  [34]?
  [35]?
Jaromil announced?[36] the release of Dowse?[37], ?a transparent proxy
setup supporting Tor?. One feature is that it detects ?all URLs whose
domain ends in .onion, routing them directly to Tor, effectively making
the onion network accessible without any plugin or software installed.?
The transport proxy approach has known issues?[38] but can still be of
interest to some users. Jaromil is seeking feedback and opinions from
the community.
  [36]?
  [37]?

Microsoft?s Geoff McDonald wrote a blog post?[39] describing how they
have helped remove half of the estimated four millions of Tor
clients?[40] installed by the Sefnit botnet without the computer owner?s
  [39]?
  [40]?
Koumbit has been working on Torride?[41], a live distribution to run Tor
relays?? not unlike Tor-ramdisk?[42]?? but based on Debian. Version
1.1.0 has been released?[43] on January 10th.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Can NAT traversal be Tor's killer feature? 
Helder Ribeiro:
Are you aware of OnionCat?
From the description of the Debian package:
 OnionCat creates a transparent IP layer on top of Tor hidden
 services. It transparently transmits any kind of IP-based data
 through the Tor network on a location hidden basis. You can think of
 it as a point-to-multipoint VPN between hidden services.
 OnionCat is a stand-alone application which runs in userland and is a
 connector between Tor and the local OS. Any protocol based on IP,
 such as UDP or TCP, can be transmitted.
 OnionCat supports IPv6; native IPv4 forwarding, though still
 available, is deprecated: the recommended solution for IPv4
 forwarding is to build a IPv4-through-IPv6 tunnel through OnionCat.

Red Sonja:
If you use public key cryptography, we can say yes. That's why we
often differenciate between anonymity and pseudonymity. With GnuPG, one
can create a strong pseudonymous identity. Using Tor while using this
identity will make it harder to link it with other identities.

Tor Weekly News                                          July 16th, 2014
Welcome to the sixteenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
Roundup of research on incentives for running Tor relays
The various roadmaps that came out of the 2014 summer dev. meeting?[21]
have been transcribed?[22] in a joint effort by George Kadianakis,
Yawning Angel, Karsten Loesing, and an anonymous person. Most items will
probably be matched with a ticket soon.
  [21]:?
  [22]:?
The Tor Project is hiring a financial controller?[23]. This is a part
time position, approximately 20 hours per week, at the office in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.
  [23]:?
The Tails developers announced the creation of two new mailing lists.
?If you are a designer, UX/UI expert or beginner??[24] interested in the
theory and practice of designing user interfaces for Tails, the tails-ux
list?[25] is for you, while the tails-project list?[26] is dedicated to
?the ?life? of the project??[27]; however, ?technical questions should
stay on tails-dev?.
  [24]:?
  [25]:?
  [26]:?
  [27]:?
Alan kicked of the aforementioned tails-ux mailing list announcing
progress?[28] on Tails initial login screen. The new set of mockups is
visible on the corresponding blueprint?[29].
  [28]:?
  [29]:?
More mockups! Nima Fatemi produced?[30] some for a possible
browser-based Tor control panel, incorporating features that were lost
with the removal of Vidalia from the Tor Browser, such as the world map
with Tor circuit visualizations. ?How would you perfect that image??[31]
What?s missing??, asked Nima, hoping ?to inspire people to start hacking
on it?.
  [30]:?
  [31]:?
Meanwhile, Sean Robinson had been working?[32] on a new graphical Tor
controller called Syboa?[33]. Sean?s ?primary motivation for Syboa was
to replace TorK, so it looks?[34] more like TorK than Vidalia?. Sean
announces that he will not have time for further development soon but
that he would answer questions.

Juha Nurmi submitted?[35] the weekly status report for the ahmia.fi GSoC

Welcome to the twenty-ninth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the
weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
Tails 1.1 is out!
txtorcon?[15], the Tor control protocol implementation for the Twisted
framework?[16], received a new minor release?[17]. Version 0.10.1 fixes
?a couple bugs introduced along with the endpoints feature in 0.10.0?.
  [15]:?
  [16]:?
  [17]:?
Roger Dingledine posted?[18] an official reaction to the cancellation of
a proposed talk at the upcoming Blackhat2014 conference dealing with
possible deanonymization attacks on Tor users and hidden services.
  [18]:?
Tor ships with a sample webpage?[19] that can be used by exit node
operators to identify their system as such to anyone wishing to identify
the source of Tor traffic. Operators most often copy and adapt this
template to the local situation. Mick Morgan discovered than his version
was out of sync?[20] and contained broken links. ?If other operators are
similarly using a page based on the old template, they may wish to
update?, Mick advised.
  [19]:?
  [20]:?
Michael Rogers, one of the developers of Briar?[21], announced?[22] a
new mailing list?[23] for discussing peer-to-peer-based communication
systems based on Tor hidden services. As Briar and other systems might
be ?running into similar issues?, a shared place to discuss them seemed

Karsten Loesing and Philipp Winter are looking for front-end web
developers?[24]: ?We are looking for somebody to fork and extend one of
the two main Tor network status websites Atlas?[25] or Globe?[26]?
writes Karsten. Both websites currently need love and new maintainers.
Please reach out if you want to help!
  [24]:?
  [25]:?
  [26]:?
The database which holds Tor bridges, usually called BridgeDB?[27], is
able to give out bridge addresses through email. This feature was
recently extended to make the email autoresponder support more bridge
types, which required introducing new keywords that must be used in the
initial request. Matthew Finkel is looking for feedback?[28] on the
current set of commands and how they could be improved.
  [27]:?
  [28]:?
Lunar wrote a detailed report?[29] on his week at the Libre Software
Meeting in Montpellier, France. The report covers the booth jointly held
with Nos Oignons?[30], his talk in the security track, and several
contacts made with other free software projects.
  [29]:?
  [30]:?
Here?s another round of reports from Google Summer of Code students: the
mid-term: Amogh Pradeep on Orbot and Orfox improvements?[31], Israel
Leiva on the GetTor revamp?[32], Quinn Jarrell on the pluggable
transport combiner?[33], Juha Nurmi on the ahmia.fi project?[34], Marc
Juarez on website fingerprinting defenses?[35], and Daniel Mart? on
incremental updates to consensus documents?[36].

Tim Retout announced?[37] that apt-transport-tor?[38] 0.2.1 has entered
Debian unstable. This package enables APT to download Debian packages
through Tor.
  [37]:?
  [38]:?
Atlas?[39] can now also be used to search for Tor bridges. In the past,
Atlas was only able to search for relays. This was made possible thanks
to a patch?[40] developed by Dmitry Eremin-Solenikov.
  [39]:?

Thanks to Tim Semeijn?[41] and Tobias Bauer?[42] for setting up new
mirrors of the Tor Project?s website and its software.

Tor help desk roundup
user3224 wants to log in to its Google, Microsoft etc. accounts and
wonders if they will know the real name and other personal
information?[43]. Roya and mirimir explained that if someone logs into
an already personalized account Tor can?t anonymize this user. Instead
it might be wise to use Tor to register a pseudonym and also use an
anonymous operating system like Tails or Whonix.
  [43]:?
escapologybb has set up a Raspberry Pi. It serves as SOCKS proxy for the
internal network. While everyone can use it, escapologybb asks what the
security implications are and if this lowers the overall anonymity?[44].
If you know a good answer please share your knowledge with the users of
Tor StackExchange.

Welcome to the thirtieth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
Tor Browser 3.6.3 is out
?Bad? relays are malicious, misconfigured, or otherwise broken Tor
relays. As anyone is free to volunteer bandwidth and processing power to
spin up a new relay, users can encounter such bad relays once in a
while. Getting them out of everyone?s circuits is thus important.
Damian Johnson and Philipp Winter have been working on improving and
documenting?[17] the process of reporting bad relays. ?While we do
regularly scan the network for bad relays, we are also dependent on the
wider community to help us spot relays which don?t act as they should?
wrote?[18] Philipp.
When observing unusual behaviors, one way to learn about the current
exit relay before reporting it is to use the Check?[19] service. This
method can be inaccurate and tends to be a little bit cumbersome. The
good news is that Arthur Edelstein is busy integrating?[20] more
feedback on Tor circuits being used directly into the Tor Browser.

Miscellaneous news
A number of Iranian Tor users have reported that Tor no longer works out
of the box in Iran, and the Tor Metrics portal shows a corresponding
drop in the number of directly-connecting users there?[40]. Collin
Anderson investigated the situation and reported that the
Telecommunication Company of Iran had begun blocking the Tor network by
blacklisting connections to Tor?s directory authorities?[41]. Tor users
can circumvent this block by getting bridges from BridgeDB?[42] and
entering the bridge addresses they receive into their Tor Browser.

Tails moves to Wheezy
Pups, a chat system implemented by Sherief Alaa for real-time

In response to a question about the writing of unit tests for tor, Nick

Nick also put out a call (relayed by Moritz Bartl?[30]) for Tor relay

@_subject: [tor-talk] Decentralized internet with Tor 
Brian Barker:
This document does not come from the Tor Project and to the best of my
knowledge is not endorsed by the project in any way.
One thing that Tor gives you: it makes it hard for your Internet
access provider to learn your network activities. This is best achieved
when the Tor client is running on your computer if you want to avoid
monitoring from people sharing the local network.
The other thing is that applications tend to reveal much more that you
think about your system or your work. Without an audit (and some
changes), most applications will leak sensitive data. Channeling their
network traffic blindly to the Tor network might just give you a false
sense of security.
I'm not saying that approaching the question at the router level is
uninteresting, but it's far trickier to get right than one may think.

that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
Tails 1.0.1 is out
David Fifield updated?[17] the experimental Tor Browser builds that
include the meek pluggable transport?[18]. The new packages are based on
Tor Browser version 3.6.2.

meejah announced?[19] a new release of txtorcon ? a Twisted-based
asynchronous Tor control protocol implementation. Version 0.10.0 adds

that ANY Twisted program that uses endpoints can accept ?onion:? strings
to bring up a hidden services easily?[?]. Typically, no code changes to
the application should be needed?[?].?

Following up on his earlier promise?[21], Karsten Loesing shut down?[22]
the Tor Metrics portal?s relay-search service, and in doing so reduced
the size of the metrics database from 95 gigabytes to a mere 3. ?If the
metrics website shows you funny numbers in the next couple of days,
please let me know?, wrote Karsten.
 [21]:?

Andrew Lewman reported?[23] on his activities for May. Sebastian G.
subsequently opened two discussions on the tor-talk mailing list?[24]:
one regarding the challenges of integrating Tor into millions of
products?[25] and another on how US legislation is preventing the Tor
Project, Inc. from receiving donations from certain countries?[26].

ahmia.fi?[28], and Zack Mullaly on the HTTPS Everywhere secure ruleset
update mechanism?[29].

Lukas Erlacher has released OnionPy 0.1.5?[30]. ?If you are planning to
make something in python that uses the tor network status, accessing
Onionoo?[31] using OnionPy might be exactly what you need?, Lukas wrote.
 [30]:?
 [31]:?
The Tails developers suggested?[32] that Tails translation teams using
git, rather than the online Transifex platform, should begin signing
their email pull requests with OpenPGP keys, to ensure that the process
is not open to exploitation.
 [32]:?
Drupal.org, the main website for the development community around the
free and open-source web platform Drupal, subscribes to a blacklist that
includes Tor exit nodes, making it difficult for Tor users to interact
with the site. AohRveTPV explained the problem?[33], and asked for
?ideas on how to actually achieve better Drupal.org support for Tor
 [33]:?
Chris Double described?[34] a detailed but experimental method for using
Tor with Firefox OS, the mobile operating system from Mozilla. ?This is
just a proof of concept. Don?t depend on this?[?] Ideally Tor would be
integrated with Firefox OS so that you can start and stop it as a
service and maybe whitelist or blacklist sites that should and shouldn?t
use Tor. I hope to do some of this over time or hope someone else gets
excited enough to work on it too.?

bk201 found some random-looking domain names in the logs of some network
software. These connection attempts disappeared when Tor was

user1747 often visits web sites which provide their services both within
the visible web and as a hidden service (DuckDuckGo might serve as an
example). Does the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) automatically switch to a
hidden service in this case?[38]? mirimir explained that there is no
connection between DNS and the names of hidden services, so TBB doesn?t
know about this hidden service and can?t connect automatically. user2949
pointed to a plugin?[39], similar to HTTPS Everywhere, that forwards a
request to a hidden service if it is available.

Researchers from the Internet Geographies project at the Oxford Internet
Institute produced a cartogram?[23] of Tor users by country, using
archived data freely available from the Tor Project?s own Metrics
portal?[24], along with an analysis of the resulting image. ?As ever
more governments seek to control and censor online activities, users
face a choice to either perform their connected activities in ways that
adhere to official policies, or to use anonymity to bring about a freer
and more open Internet?, they conclude.

Andrew Lewman reported?[25] that users with email addresses at Yahoo and
AOL have been removed from the tor-relays mailing list?[26], as these

A couple of weeks ago, Roger Dingledine wondered ?how many relays are
firewalling certain outbound ports (and thus messing with connectivity
inside the Tor network)?. ra has just published the results?[34] of a
three-week-long test of the interconnectivity between 6730 relays.
Contacting the operators of problematic relays is probably the next step
for those who wish to keep the network at its best.

George Kadianakis slipped on his storyteller costume to guide us?[35]
through layers of the Tor core, motivated by the quest for knowledge.
That accursed riddle, ?Why does Roger have so many guards??, now has an
answer. Be prepared for a ?beautiful stalagmite? and the ?truly amazing?
nature of Tor!

Tor Weekly News                                          March 5th, 2014
Welcome to the ninth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
Tor 0.2.4.21 is out
Members of the Prosecco research team released a new attack on the TLS
protocol?[21]?? dubbed ?Triple Handshake??? allowing impersonation of a
given client when client authentication is in use together with session
resumption and renegotiation. Nick Mathewson published a detailed
analysis of why Tor is not affected?[22], and also outlines future
changes to make Tor resistant to even more potential TLS issues.
  [21]:?
  [22]:?
Mike Perry announced?[23] the start of a weekly Tor Browser developer?s
meeting, to be held on  on irc.oftc.net. These meetings are
tentatively scheduled for 19:00 UTC on Wednesdays. Details on the format
and flow of the meetings can be found on the tor-dev and tbb-dev?[24]
mailing lists.
  [23]:?
  [24]:?
Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson were among the signatories of an
open letter?[25] published by the EFF which offers ten principles for
technology companies to follow in protecting users from illegal
  [25]:?
Nick Mathewson also detailed?[26] a change in the way that the core Tor
development team will use the bugtracker?s ?milestone? feature to
separate tickets marked for resolution in a given Tor version from those
that can be deferred to a later release.
  [26]:?
Nick then sent out the latest in his irregular series of Tor proposal
status updates?[27], containing summaries of each open proposal,
guidance for reviewers, and notes for further work. If you'd like to
help Tor?s development by working on one of these proposals, start here!
  [27]:?
On the subject of proposals, two new ones were sent to the tor-dev list
for review: proposal 228?[28], which offers a way for relays to prove
ownership of their onion keys as well as their identity key, and
proposal 229?[29] based on Yawning Angel?s unnumbered submission from
last week, which concerns improvements to the SOCKS5 protocol for
communication between clients, Tor, and pluggable transports.
  [28]:?
  [29]:?
Nicholas Merrill wrote?[30] to the Liberationtech list to announce that
xmpp.net now lists XMPP servers that are reachable over hidden
services?[31], and that xmpp.net?s server scanner works with these as
  [30]:?
  [31]:?
Patrick Schleizer announced?[32] the release of version 8 of
Whonix?[33]??  an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and
security based on the Tor anonymity network, Debian and security by
isolation. The curious should take a look at the long changelog.
  [32]:?
  [33]:?
Kelley Misata wrote up an account?[34] of her talk ?Journalists ?
Staying Safe in a Digital World?, which she delivered at the
Computer-Assisted Reporting Conference in Baltimore.
  [34]:?
Having co-authored a paper in 2012 on usability issues connected with
the Tor Browser Bundle?[35], Greg Norcie drew attention?[36] to a
follow-up study named ?Why Johnny Can?t Blow the Whistle??[37], which
focuses on verifying the conclusions of the earlier tests while
exploring a number of other possible usability improvements. The study
was, however, carried out before the release of Tor Browser version 3,
which improved the bundle?s usability based on earlier suggestions.
  [35]:?
  [36]:?
  [37]:?
Mac OS X users will be thrilled to learn that the next Tor Browser
Bundle will be shipped as a DMG (disk image)?[38] instead of the
previous unusual .ZIP archive?[39].
  [38]:?
  [39]:?
David Rajchenbach-Teller from Mozilla reached out?[40] to the Tor
Browser developers about their overhaul of the Firefox Session Restore
mechanism. This is another milestone in the growing collaboration
between the Tor Project and Mozilla.
  [40]:?
On the ?anonymity is hard? front, David Fifield reported?[41] a
fingerprinting issue on the Tor Browser. Fallback charsets can be used
to learn the user locale as they vary from one to another. The next
release of the Tor Browser will use ?windows-1252? for all locales, as
this matches the impersonated ?User-Agent? string (Firefox???English
version?? on Windows) that it already sends in its HTTP headers.
  [41]:?
Yawning Angel called for help?[42] in testing and reviewing
obfsclient-0.0.1rc2, the second obfsclient release candidate this week:
?assuming nothing is broken, this will most likely become v0.0.1, though
I may end up disabling Session Ticket handshakes.?
  [42]:?
David Fifield published?[43] a guide to patching meek, an HTTP pluggable
transport, so that it can be used to send traffic via Lantern?[44], a
censorship circumvention system which ?acts as an HTTP proxy and proxies
your traffic through trusted friends.?
  [43]:?
  [44]:?
Fortasse started a discussion?[45] on tor-talk about using HTTPS
Everywhere to redirect Tor Browser users to .onion addresses when
available. Several people commented regarding the procedure, its
security, or how it could turn the Tor Project or the EFF into some kind
of registrar.
  [45]:?
anonym has been busy?[46] adapting the configuration interface from the
Tor Browser?? called ?Tor Launcher??? to Tails? needs. Preliminary
results can already be seen in the images built from the experimental
  [46]:?
  [47]:?
Ramo wrote?[48] to announce their Nagios plugin project?[49] to the
relay operator community. Lunar pointed out a complementary probe named

  [49]:?
  [50]:?
Virgil Griffith sent a draft proposal?[51] for changes to improve the
latency of hidden services when using the ?Tor2web? mode. Roger
Dingledine commented?[52] that one of the proposed changes actually
opened a new research question regarding the actual latency benefits.
  [51]:?
  [52]:?
David Goulet released the fourth candidate of his Torsocks rewrite?[53].
This new version comes after ?a big code review from Nick and help from
a lot of people contributing and testing?. But more reviews and testing
are now welcome!
  [53]:?
Tor help desk roundup
Janice needs to be able to connect from an IP address in a specific city
and wanted to know if Tor can be used to do so?[56]. Several users
suggested that this is not possible with Tor. For city-level IP
addresses, it might better to use other services like a proxy or a
tunnel, provided one does not require anonymity.
  [56]:?
The Tor Browser Bundle sets the default font to Times New Roman 16pt and
allows pages to use their own fonts. User joeb likes to change the
settings and wondered how this increases the possibility to fingerprint
a user?[57]. gacar suggested that this will facilitate fingerprinting
attacks. Several important sites use font probing to fingerprint their
users?[58], and changing the default fonts is likely to make a user
stand out from the common anonymity set.
  [57]:?
  [58]:?
Kristopher Ives wondered?[59] if Tor uses some kind of compression.
Several users searched the source code archives for ?gzip??[60] and
found code which deals with directory information. Jens Kubieziel argued
that Tor operates on encrypted data and compressing encrypted data
usually results in a increase in size, so it makes no sense to compress
this data.
  [59]:?
  [60]:?
Stackexchange uses bounties to award higher reputations to answers. By
using this one can attract attention and get better answers or an answer
at all. The question about using DNSSEC and DNScrypt over Tor?[61] is
probably the first to receive a bounty: an answer to this question would
be rewarded with 50 points. However, they have not been earned yet, so
if you know an answer, please enlighten the rest of the community.

newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
New release of tor-ramdisk
Tails issued the call for testing for its 0.23 release?[10]. At the very

Tor help desk roundup
The last few weeks have seen several vulnerabilities in the GnuTLS
library and the SSL protocol in general?[34]. Ivar wanted to know if the
GnuTLS bug affected Tor somehow?[35]; as Tor uses OpenSSL instead of
GnuTLS, the answer is no.
  [34]:?
  [35]:?
tor_user found the option ?Socks5Proxy? in the Tor manual, and wanted to
know what OR connections are and if this option allows running a Tor
node over a SOCKS proxy?[36]. Jens Kubieziel explained that OR
connections are those between two relays or between a client and a
relay.  While this config option can be used to proxy outgoing OR
connections from a relay, it won?t proxy exit streams, and also the
relay still needs to be reachable on its advertised ORPort, so it is
simplest to say that no, it can?t be used to run a relay over a SOCKS

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB - Correct/proper use of TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH=1 ? 
Zenaan Harkness:
TOR_SKIP_LAUNCH was designed for Whonix and Tails use cases. For both
the tor daemon is started independently of the Tor Browser. For the
former on a different host and for the latter under a different system
None of the above. What is the problem of running tor locally?
Why would you want to do that instead of using a (private) bridge?
Using a relay as a bridge is when you configure a public Tor relay
instead of an unlisted bridge as one of tor bridges. There are very few
use cases where it makes sense. See ?Bridge? and ?UseBridge? in tor(1)
manual page.

Zenaan Harkness:
Sorry, but your message is too long. You should try to ask less
questions at the same times, as the answer from one is likely to help
you answer the other. I'm jumping to the most obvious ones here.
I believe it's not. The Whonix Workstation is unable to reach the
Internet except by connecting to the tor daemon running on the
gateway. To the best of my understanding, with what you describe, the
computers that would run the Tor Browser would not be isolated of the
When I say ?running tor locally?, I mean running the tor daemon on
the computer that will run the Tor Browser. That's how Tor is generally
used. The tor daemon takes care of reaching the Tor network and
relaying information through it. This is sometimes referred in the
literature as an ?Onion Proxy?.
This has nothing to do with relaying the traffic of others.
I still don't understand why you want to do things differently than
just run the Tor Browser and eventually configure Tor to use a bridge.
Users of high-latency, law-bandwidth, only sometimes-on Internet
connections are perfectly able to use bridges.
Bridges are unlisted Tor relays, but they are normally part of the
bridge database and get distributed to users in need through specific
channels (see ).
Private bridges do not record themselves to the bridge database. Their
addresses need to be explicitly given by the bridge operator to be used.
All Tor relays are public as the list of all Tor relays if available to
everyone. That's the differences with bridges. The list of all (public)
bridges is not available anywhere else than the bridge database. There
is no list of all private bridges.
There is no such thing as a private Tor relay, except on a test network.

Welcome to the eighteenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
Tor Browser 3.6 is released
?Version 1.0 is often an important milestone that denotes the maturity
of a free software project. The first public version of what would
become Tails was released on June 23 2009?[?]. That was almost five
years ago. Tails 1.0 marks the 36th stable release since then.?
The release announcement?[8] could have not said it better. On top of
the simple idea of having a system entirely running in memory that
guarantees Tor usage for all network connections, Tails has been
extended with an USB installer, automatic upgrades, persistence, support
for Tor bridges, MAC address spoofing, an extensive and translated
documentation and many more features?[9].
Over Tails 0.23, the new version brings security fixes from Firefox and
Tor?[10], an updated I2P, several enhancements to the Tor configuration
interface, and the appearance of the new Tails logo?[11].
More details are in the release announcement. For those who have not
made use of the integrated updater, time to download?[12] the new

Monthly status reports for April 2014
The Tails developers warned?[32] that two fake public keys have been
found bearing email addresses associated with the project; do not trust
these keys, or anything they may have been used to sign. You can check
the real keys used to sign Tails software on the Tails website?[33].
  [32]:?
  [33]:?
Erinn Clark alerted?[34] users of the Trac-based Tor wiki?[35] to the
fact that a bug (now fixed) made it possible to register an account with
an already-taken username, ?overwriting the existing user?s password and
thereby taking over the account?. ?We recommend users try to login and
if you find you are unable to do so, you can reset your password??on the
appropriate Trac page?[36].
  [34]:?
  [35]:?
  [36]:?
Following up on previous discussions?[37] and a proposal?[38] on the
topic of how to make hidden services scale, Christopher Baines went on
and implemented a prototype?[39], ?for one possible design of how to
allow distribution in hidden services?. The code and concrete design is
up for feedback.
  [37]:?
  [38]:?
  [39]:?
Daniel Mart? sent out?[40] a list of proposed revisions ? arrived at in
discussion with other developers on IRC ? to the now slightly outdated
proposal 140, which forms the basis of his upcoming Google Summer of
Code project to implement consensus diffs and so reduce the amount of
information downloaded hourly by Tor clients. Among the proposals are
support for microdescriptor consensus diffs and a time limit to prevent
the leak of information about when Tor was last used; ?ideas about what
might be missing or needing an update are welcome?, wrote Daniel.
  [40]:?
Alpha releases of Orbot v14 are now available?[41] for testing. They
include support for the obfs3 and ScrambleSuit protocols, thanks to

Griffin Boyce solicited feedback on the first release of Satori?[43], an
?app for Google Chrome that distributes circumvention software in a
difficult-to-block way and makes it easy for users to check if it?s been
tampered with in-transit.?
  [43]:?
Kelley Misata announced on the Tor Blog?[44] that this year?s Tor Summer
Dev Meeting will be held between June 29th and July 4th at the French
offices of Mozilla in Paris.
  [44]:?
Also on the blog, Andrew Lewman announced?[45] that the temporary limit
on donations to the Tor Project through Paypal has now been lifted.
  [45]:?
Nicolas Vigier announced?[46] that the Tor Browser test suite will now
be run automatically when a new build is ready. The results will be
emailed to the tor-qa mailing list.
  [46]:?
Nick Mathewson suggested?[47] that proposal 236?[48], which deals with
the proposed transition to single guard nodes for Tor clients, should
include the retention of multiple guards for directory requests, since
?trusting a single source for the completeness and freshness of your
directory info is suboptimal.?
  [47]:?
  [48]:?
Jacob H. Haven, Mikhail Belous, and Noah Rahman each introduced their

user1698 wants to extend the number of Tor relays in a circuit, and asks
if it is possible to have one with 5 or 6 nodes?[57]. Tom Ritter
suggests that this is only possible when one changes the source code.
There is another question which deals with extending the number of nodes
in a circuit?[58]: Steven Murdoch warns the user in his answer that
under some circumstances it might be possible to de-anonymize a person
who is using this technique.  Furthermore alaf discusses the
performance, throughput and anonymity of longer circuits.

Welcome to the twentieth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
Tor 0.2.4.22 is out
David Goulet reported?[9] on the status of the development of Torsocks
2.0, the library for safely using applications with Tor.
   [9]:?
Karsten Loesing posted?[10] on the Tor Blog to commemorate the tenth
anniversary of the first archived Tor directory, and discussed the
different ways in which the public archive of directory data is being
used for research and development.
  [10]:?
Karsten also notified?[11] the community of a change in the compression
algorithm used for the tarballs of archived metrics data, which has
reduced their total size from 212 gigabytes to 33 ? an 85% gain!
  [11]:?
Knock?[12] is a variant of port-knocking that might be useful in the
future for pluggable transports. ?As Knock uses two fields in the TCP
header in order to hide information and we explicitly want to be
compatible with machines sitting in typical home networks?, writes?[13]
Julian Kirsch, ?we thus created a program which tests if Knock would
work in your environment.? Please give it a try?[14] to help the team
figure out if Knock could be deployed in the wild.
  [12]:?
  [13]:?
  [14]:?
Thanks to Jesse Victors?[15], Andrea?[16], Nicholas Merrill?[17], and
Martin A.?[18] for running mirrors of the Tor Project website!
  [15]:?
  [16]:?
  [17]:?
  [18]:?
Michael Schloh von Bennewitz has been busy analyzing a disk leak?[19] in
Tor Browser: when one copies a significant chunk of text to the
clipboard, a temporary file is created with its content. Michael found a
possible fix and is welcoming reviews?[20].
  [19]:?
  [20]:?
Nicolas Vigier has been investigating?[21] some extra connections made
by the Tor Browser on startup to the local resolver and the default port
or the SOCKS proxy.
  [21]:?
Shawn Nock proved us once more that talking to ISP is key to run Tor
relays on high-speed links. Shawn?s exit node was abruptly shut down by
its provider?[22] on May 15th. After a well-crafted plea explaining why
Tor is important, the provider restored the service?[23] on the very
same day!
  [22]:?
  [23]:?
However, dope457 reported that their provider is now giving them trouble
for being the operator of a non-exit relay?[24], due to a large amount
of traffic on the DNS port (53), which is being used as the ORPort by a
recently-established Tor relay?[25], as pointed?out [26] by Roman
  [24]:?
  [25]:?
  [26]:?
Now that ICANN is ?selling? top-level domain names, Anders Andersson
raised concerns?[27] about the .onion extension used by Tor.
Fortunately, RFC6761?[28] defines a process regarding special-use domain
names. Last November, Christian Grothoff, Matthias Wachs, Hellekin O.
Wolf, and Jacob Appelbaum submitted a request to reserve several TLDs
used in peer-to-peer systems?[29]. Hellekin sent an update?[30] about
the procedure: ?the current status quo from the IETF so far is that this
issue is not a priority?.
  [27]:?
  [28]:?
  [29]:?
  [30]:?
Tor help desk roundup
The Tor StackExchange site?[31] now provides more than 1000 answers to
user-supplied questions. However, there are still ~130 questions?[32]
which need a good answer, so if you happen to know one then please visit
the site and help out.
The majority of the questions are about the Tor Browser Bundle?[33], but
hidden services also attract a large amount of attention?[34]. When it
comes to operating systems, there are 42 Windows-related questions?[35],
while questions about Tails?[36] and Whonix?[37] number nearly 50. All
your questions about Tor and related software are welcome.

Blue_Pyro uses Orweb on a mobile phone and wants to save images from
websites?[38]. Abel of Guardian recommended two options: first, a user
can use Firefox mobile with privacy enhanced options?[39], or one can
try Orfox?[40], a development version of a Firefox-based browser.

Charles Thomas:
Such setup is called ?transparent proxying?. This does not simulate
using Tails. Tails has removed transparent proxying (except for hidden
services) a while ago (0.10, 2012-01-04).
Transparent proxying means that applications will just happily connect
to wherever they want to connect. That means sending local IP address,
serial number for software updates, usernames and many other identifying
information. Often without proper encryption or peer authentication.
It is true that such setup will make all DNS requests go through Tor.
But DNS requests are not the only leaks you need to protect from. Such
setup makes it hard to use the Tor Browser which contains many changes
needed to prevent fingerprinting while using the web. To sum it up, this
is likely to give a false sense of security or worse.
Configure Thunderbird to only compose plain text messages. Then delete
the text you don't want to quote. It's simply text.

Localization is so much fun. So PhantomJS 1.9.0 does not properly
display Arabic without a webfont. And Firefox 24 does not properly
display Arabic with a webfont. *grin* (Firefox 29 is fixed though.)
The SVG should now use the default ?sans-serif? font and be ok. The PNG
are still using Amiri and do not look too awful at first sight.
I believe the translation for ISP to be too long. Is there any shorter
string that could convey the meaning?

*sigh*  I belive ?password? is wrong because of the mishandling of

symbols from that string?
For ?connection?, I can try with the other fonts you've mentioned, but I
would be happy if you could tell me what I should be looking at. :)

Welcome to the twenty-first issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
OnionShare and tor?s ControlPort
Anthony G. Basile released [14] version 20140520 of tor-ramdisk [15],
the micro Linux distribution ?whose only purpose is to host a Tor server
in an environment that maximizes security and privacy?. The new version
upgrades Tor to version 0.2.4.22, which ?adds an important block to
authority signing keys that were used on authorities vulnerable to the
?heartbleed? bug in OpenSSL?, among other fixes; upgrading ?is strongly

browser for iOS platforms tunneling traffic through Tor. From the
conclusion: ?we believe that the Onion Browser project is on the right
track, however there is still a long way ahead for the project to be
appropriately ?ripe? for usage in actually privacy-relevant and
critically important scenarios.? All reported issues should have been
fixed in release 1.5 [18] on May 14th.
 [16]:  [17]:  [18]: A new pluggable transport, currently named obfs4 [19], is being crafted

obfs3 style UniformDH and CTR-AES256/HMAC-SHA256, obfs4 uses a
combination of Curve25519, Elligator2, HMAC-SHA256, XSalsa20/Poly1305
and SipHash-2-4?. The feature set offered by obfs4 is comparable to
ScrambleSuit, with minor differences. Yawning is now asking the
community for comments, reviews, and tests [20].
 [19]:  [20]: Stem now offers a control interpreter, ?a new method for interacting

interpreter with raw access similar to telnet? [21]. Damian Johnson

proposal [28] for the ?Revamp GetTor? Google Summer of Code project,
having concluded that a full rewrite is needed.

to go with those for other Linux distributions [31].
 [30]:  [31]: AddressSanitizer [32] (ASan) is a powerful memory error detector:
software built with such technology makes it a lot harder to exploit
programming errors related to memory management. Happily, Georg Koppen

I believe you are mistaken. Quoting tor manpage:
       HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient auth-type client-name,client-name,...
           If configured, the hidden service is accessible for
           authorized clients only. The auth-type can either be
           'basic' for a general-purpose authorization protocol or
           'stealth' for a less scalable protocol that also hides
           service activity from unauthorized clients. Only clients
           that are listed here are authorized to access the hidden
           service. Valid client names are 1 to 16 characters long
           and only use characters in A-Za-z0-9+-_ (no spaces). If
           this option is set, the hidden service is not accessible
           for clients without authorization any more. Generated
           authorization data can be found in the hostname file.
           Clients need to put this authorization data in their
           configuration file using HidServAuth.

Jeremy Olexa:
If this needs repeating on this list: this is a bad idea. It will give
people illusions instead of actual protection.
The Tor Browser is already having a hard time fighting against the
numerous browser fingerprinting scheme that exists today. Telling people
they will be anonymous using their normal Internet Explorer is
misleading if not dishonest. Using evercookies will be enough to track
them across restarts and networks.
Going through Tor will still protect them from monitoring by their ISP,
which is highly desirable. But this is not what the selling pitch is
about, here.
Users of such products might be able to download OS X security updates
without revealing their IP address to Apple. I am not sure this will
actually hide their location (as the OS can figure it out by looking at
nearby Wi-Fi networks), but it will surely not hide their Mac serial
number or Apple ID. I am not sure this is what people would call

BM-2cTjsegDfZQNGQWUQjSwro6jrWLC9B3MN3 at bitmessage.ch:
You can still configure this option through the Network Settings
available from the onion menu. The ReachableAddress setting is a bonus:
Tor will try to connect to relays in turn until it succeeds, so it
should eventually try to connect to a relay that listens on the right
The rationale from removing the option is the amount of headaches for
users and support: how many users know what a firewall is? How many
users know the difference between an outgoing and an incoming firewall?
How many users actually *have* an outgoing firewall?
So they would enable ReacheableAddress for the two ports you mention,
and then configure bridges. And so Tor was not ever able to connect
because it wasn't allowed to connect to the configured bridges.
If it's about networw security, how about configuring bridges and only
allowing these specific IP and port in the firewall?

Hartmut Haase:
Tor Browser 4.0 now contains an automated upgrade system. To start the
update, go to the Help menu, open About Tor Browser. If there's an
upgrade available, there will be a button right there.

Quoting the release announcement:
    Please also be aware that the security of the updater depends on the
    specific CA that issued the  HTTPS certificate
    (Digicert), and so it still must be activated manually through the
    Help ("?") "about browser" menu option. Very soon, we will support
    both strong HTTPS site-specific certificate pinning (ticket     and update package signatures (ticket  Until then, we do not
    recommend using this updater if you need stronger security and
    normally verify GPG signatures.

John Pinkman:
Please refrain from posting such links. Tor stands for privacy and
against harrasment. Tor communication channels should not be used to
promote sexist, privacy-intruding, harrasment-based websites.
Also, it's not because some random site uses Tor hidden services that
one can say ?that?s Tor?. If you do the same with ?the Internet?, you'll
realize how it's hardly helpful.

Georg Koppen:
Would it be over the top to do both? Build packages with only one
locale, and one package with all locales?
The latter could be used by Tails or support more users in a sneakernet
distribution scenario.

?Les Vieux Fourneaux??[1] is a comic in French published last year by
Wilfrid Lupano and Paul Cauuet. Amongst other characters, it features a
group of anarchist elders called ?Ni Yeux Ni Ma?tres??[2]. In the story
you see them fighting gentrification by filling up a trendy lounge bar
until it goes out of business.
One of the elder is getting hacking lessons from ?Arno Nimousse?. The
latter has an onion sticker on his laptop.
Some images:
