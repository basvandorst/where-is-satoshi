This also happened to me and at least one other person. In my case it
was because of trojan activity on IRC. I was using the default Tor exit
policy at that time, which, as it turns out, isn't restrictive enough.
XS4ALL told me that it's OK to run a non-exit node, which I'm running
now. There's a number of other non-exit nodes in XS4LL IP space,
including the node of one of the XS4ALL founders, so running a non-exit
node seems to be fine.

They aren't filtering Tor exit nodes, but they check for bad traffic
coming from their IP space (spam, trojans, viruses, cracking, ...). With

@_subject: Version checking (was Re: 25 tbreg relays in directory) 
Use as much donated network capacity as possible without reducing
anonymity by treating exit nodes and other nodes differently:
- Old exit nodes: Use them, but increase the circuit length by 1
- Other old nodes: Don't use them at all
Old versions that are remotely exploitable should be automatically
shutdown. Maybe the directory authorities could instruct them to do that?.
If that's not possible, they should not be listed in the directory to
reduce the risk of them getting compromised. That won't help for
existing nodes with static IP, but it will help in other cases.

@_subject: aes performance 
It would be nice if Tor was using bigger blocks, but I've not looked at
the code yet.
If you're going to replace hardware, hardware assisted encryption may be
an option. Recent VIA CPUs like the C7 and the Nano can do that. Their
clock frequency isn't very high, so something else (instead of
encryption) may become the bottleneck.
Resuls for VIA Nano (with 32-bit openssl):
VIA Nano 1.6 GHz with padlock engine
type         16 bytes    64 bytes   256 bytes  1024 bytes  8192 bytes

Performance for 16-byte blocks is pretty poor, but for bigger blocks
it's much faster.
A VIA C7 running at the same clock frequency should produce similar results.

@_author: Arjan 
@_subject: aes performance 
My point was that the '16 bytes' column was showing significantly worse
results than the other columns. It's because of overhead for more
function calls, setting up keys, setting up initialization vectors, ...
Encryption speed is indeed only part of the problem, but on my LAN (with
a few years old hardware), the VIA Nano is by far the fastest when doing
SFTP file transfers or disk encryption.

Yes, that's what I meant.
My upload speed is much too slow to run into this problem, but could the
compression be (partially) disabled for middle nodes? I'm assuming that
the data they are relaying has already been compressed + encrypted, so
it wouldn't compress much anyway.

The subnet (/48) isn't exactly small. It's 2^80 addresses ;-)

Note to other readers: The XS4ALL tunnels are for customers only.
I wouldn't recommend running an exit from XS4ALL IP space. The last time
I tried, it only took a few hours before they disconnected me.
As Nick said, unfortunately it does not work at all. The three-year
development roadmap didn't mention IPv6 plans either (the roadmap
document only briefly pointed to the proposals).
IPv4 addresses are running out:
This means that IPv6 usage will go up. It has gotten much better in the
past year. Check the yearly graph for the Amsterdam Internet Exchange
(bottom graph):
IPv6 has the added advantage that there's no NAT. More people will be
able to run Tor relays.
When using 6to4 or Teredo, your IPv6 addresses are derived from your
IPv4 address. This means that when one is known, the other is known (and
can be blocked) too.
When using native IPv6 or a tunnel from a tunnel broker, the IPv6 and
IPv4 addresses aren't related.
IPv6: Yes
Tor: Yes
And I'm willing to try IPv6 + Tor
For anyone who wants to try IPv6:
- You can get a free tunnel from a tunnel broker:
  Hurricane Electric: Easy to sign up and they have IPv6
  certification tests to let you demonstrate your IPv6 skills:
  SixXS: Signing up takes a little more effort. Privacy is a
  bit of a concern, but very recently it got better because they
  now allow you to hide your user details in the whois database:
- Or use 6to4
- Or use Teredo
SixXS (aiccu) and Teredo are easy to setup. It should work with
practically any IPv4 NAT setup.
Hurricane Electric, 6to4 and XS4ALL use protocol 41 IPv6 in IPv4 tunnels
and may be more difficult/impossible to setup, depending on your

     17 0.2.2.0-alpha-dev
Just remove all relays from the directory that are running old versions
and only keep 0.2.0.34, 0.2.0.35, 0.2.1.15-rc, 0.2.1.16-rc and maybe
0.2.2.0 listed. You'll only lose about 300 relays, so no big loss.
A relay operator should be able to keep his Tor updated. If he doesn't,
chances are that his machine will be compromised. That's bad for him.
It's also bad for the Tor users (and their anonymity), because some
entity might be able to compromise a large number of Tor relays.
Relays that are running without the PC owner knowing about it should
also be removed. The PC owner might get into trouble with his ISP or
government and the relay also has a higher risk of being compromised.

I don't think that redirecting traffic of unsuspecting users through Tor
is wise. Using TOR will make things less secure / anonymous for the
people using your wireless AP.
People using an open, unencrypted, AP can have their traffic sniffed by:
- other people nearby
- AP owner
- ISP of the AP owner
- government
- ... (depends on the destination)
When sending the traffic over TOR, it can also be monitored by:
- exit node operators (some owned by crackers / government agencies)
- ISPs of exit node operators
- governments of exit node operators
Since the AP user doesn't know he's using TOR, he will probably transmit
information that shows his identity. He may end up on a government watch
list, because they know that all TOR users are potential child
pornographers / terrorists.

I omitted the ;-) in that example, because I thought it was obvious.
I'll rephrase what I meant to say:
People who choose to use Tor will think about the consequences. They
will encrypt their traffic, hide their identity or simply refrain from
transmitting things via Tor that can get them into trouble somewhere on
this planet.
People who are using Tor without them knowing it, may not be so careful.

It's running longer longer than I would have expected. That may be
because it takes a while for the clients to find out that your relay got
out of hibernation.
When the relay is available all day, it's likely that it will
permanently run at the set RelayBandwithRate (that's what happens with
my relays).
If you're not running a directory mirror, your relay will send and
receive about 2 GiB each day (4 GiB total).
Someone else may have the answer to that.
