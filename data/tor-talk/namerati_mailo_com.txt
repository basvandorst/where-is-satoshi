@_subject: [tor-talk] Jitsi Meet over Tor 
Has anyone managed to use Jitsi Meet over Tor, either with Tor Browser or with a normal browser+SOCKPort?
Every time I try, the video/audio quality is unusable. Things drop out, I can't hear people, they can't hear me, etc. THis is true even if video is turned off.
