Another option is a VPN, if you're more concerned about choosing your
country than strong anonymity. Astrill has a good UI for picking which
country your traffic is to come from.

Hi there,
If your main concern is merely circumvention (and you're not worried about
retaliation for circumventing), you might be better off using a VPN.
Unlike Tor, there is no globally published list of all VPN services, so you
could probably find one that isn't blocked by your country. Most services
take Bitcoin if payment is an issue... I'd look askance at any "free" VPN.

Thanks Nathan.
While it's true VPNs have downsides, if bandwidth (and not anonymity) is
the top priority, Tor may not be the solution for that person. Even if we
drastically increase the number of nodes in the network, it's hard to
imagine Tor (with 3 hops) will be able to have less latency than a single
hop VPN.
(But yes, I agree we are too often quick to push people to VPNs)

So the post seems to weigh heavily towards proof of work in Tor Browser,
rather than running .onion sites. (Which apparently attract less malicious
traffic? Interesting tidbit)
My question: why not simply move to using SHA-256? The main point in the
blog seemed to be that that using .onion sites is not workable due to the
use of SHA-1. Since the Tor Project has limited resources, it seems like
switching hashes and asking websites to use .onion addies would create less
work for the devs but have a similar effect to a proof of work module in
Tor Browser.
However, I may be missing something important, and if so please feel free
to enlighten me :)
