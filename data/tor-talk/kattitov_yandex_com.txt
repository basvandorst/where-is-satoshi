@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy 0.0.10 released - testing and feedback 
Hi Jake,
It's a bit difficult to describe succinctly, but I'll try to relay my
thoughts ...
It's about the indications that you are actually using Tor.
I've been using Tor since before TBB, probably since before Vidalia,
and one of the great features of TBB is that on start-up it tells you
that you're successfully using Tor. And the occasional failure due to
not recognising the exit node you've come from is handy for making you
stop, think, check the IP address, and make sure you still have an
understanding of how Tor works.
And then there's the fact that pages load a little slower over Tor, not
intolerably slow but still noticeably slow.
So you know that you're using Tor.
TorBirdy doesn't give this indication ... it looks like regular
Thunderbird, and email loads in the background and is just there when
you need it. Sending is a little slower and so you could infer that Tor
is in use, but you really want to know that when you start up, and
before the automatic fetch begins.
I'm not sure how I would fix these issues. Trying to have TorBirdy do
something to test Tor is in use for IMAP/POP/SMTP connections would be
quite difficult, if possible at all. But if you could do it and notify
the user before the fetch began then that would simulate some of what
TBB does. Other indicators such as a change to the skin would be a
useful indicator that you're using the right software, but still doesn't
actually test the network.
So I can't solve the problems, just point out that, from my
perspective, it's those visual clues that give confidence that your
connections are protected that are missing from the current TorBirdy.
Alternatively, if there was a way to detect that Tor was not in use and
then stop and alert the user would also be suitable.
Otherwise, all the technical aspects appear to work exactly as
expected ... I'm very happy to use it.
Thanks for the good work!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Free WiFi Bootable Ditros 
Hi all,
This is not specifically a Tor question, but there may be some on the
list who know the answer.
I'm wondering whether there are any bootable distros out there which
are designed to be used on free WiFi networks (e.g. Starbucks,
McDonalds) and enforce some level of network encryption. Tails would
obviously provide a solution here by forcing everything through Tor,
but I can also see alternatives which force the use of an IPSEC VPN, or
only allow outbound access to ports which are commonly used for secure
access (443, 993, etc).
It wouldn't need to be an entire distro, just a set of scripts which
configured the local firewall (iptables, ipfw, even the regular Windows
firewall) to only allow secure connections, and established a Tor or
VPN connection (if necessary). This would mean I could use my
regular desktop environment to read email, check social networks, etc
all the while being reasonably confident that any traffic which would
normally traverse the network unsecured (updates, etc, and any
misconfigured software) would not get access.
I guess that the set up would need to be somewhat aware of the network
it was connecting to to allow access to captive portals to agree with
the AUP.
Anything out there which does this?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Free WiFi Bootable Ditros 
Yes, I agree with Andrew, I would rather trust Tor nodes than public Agreed, but this is becoming harder to do as operating systems and the
software we use becomes more complex. The best way to solve this would
be to ensure that the OS only does what you allow it to. But outside
one of the BSDs or a very minimal Linux distro this is pretty much
impossible these days -- they're just too complex. So using a distro
which doesn't update, or only allowing updates over secure channels and
blocking all other attempts may be effective.
Yes, that's an option, but I'm looking for something minimal at the
moment, and trying to counter my impression that the risk of
interception when using public WiFi is too great. As Andrew said: "The
decision on the risks are yours."

I've seen a single SSL MITM, but that's it. I'm not a fan of SSL and see
major issues, but I think it's far from broken.
I'm not sure that I'm quite that paranoid, but Tails can certainly
provide a read-only environment.
Tails may not be designed for open WiFi networks, but until something
else comes along it may be the best solution for my needs.

Katya Titov :
Thanks all for the information, and sorry for the double post. To
summarise, I see that the issues can be grouped into three areas:
privacy, political and technology.
  The privacy side is about selecting what you require. This includes
  understanding how much information you are releasing to the site
  owner/operator, and how much you trust that person.
  The political aspects include strongly supporting privacy, keeping
  all your traffic private from prying eyes, etc.
  The technology side includes decisions such as choosing "Tor
  encryption" over SSL, remaining within a closed network, stream
  isolation, etc.
Raynardine, thank you for your thoughtful response. I understand and
support your concerns, but also think that there are different levels
of privacy the people need. Some people also need different levels of
privacy for different purposes and will create multiple identities and
operate them in different ways to achieve this. I also happen to agree
that many law makers are "elite criminals", but sometimes you need to
work from within the system to change or better exploit it and not just
exist outside it.
I treat privacy as a trade off, similar to the way I look at security
in general. The more secure/private the more restriction on what you
can do and how to achieve it.
Excellent discussion!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidalia error message with TorBirdy 
anonymous coward:
You can't really trust the CAs, at least not from state-level
attackers. And Prism seems to indicate that pretty much all traffic is
subject to recording (and later decryption?) by at least two
state-level attackers: US and UK.
IMAPS works by ensuring that an SSL (encrypted) connection is made
before the IMAP connection is made, therefore guaranteeing encrypted
comms. All that is visible to an observer are the IPs and ports
involved, and some information about the crypto being used.
STARTTLS means that the IMAP connection is made first and then the
session is 'upgraded' to become encrypted. This leaves encryption in
the hands of the client and therefore the server can't enforce
encryption. If I understand Karsten's email correctly then Thunderbird
with TorBirdy now enforces the encryption from the client end via
STARTTLS: this is good!
The certificate will be cached in the client, however if the cert is
changed (e.g. MitMed) then the client will accept the new one as long
as it checks out through the regular checking processes. So a MitM
which doesn't involve coercing a CA (or otherwise getting a 'valid'
certificate) should result in Thunderbird throwing a warning, but a
MitM due to a coerced CA will look fine. There are plugins for Firefox
which alert you to a change in certificates, but I'm not aware of any
for Thunderbird.

Douglas Lucas:
It's quite a difficult task.
I've used Certificate Patrol which alerts you if a certificate changes;
and employs some simple checks such as automatically accepting (and
still advising you) if the certificate was changed when it required
I've also used Perspectives (now Convergence) which uses a history of
certificate 'sighting' and known notaries to provide a degree of
confidence about whether or not a certificate is genuine.
Google's Chrome uses certificate pinning so that the certificates of
well known sites are hard coded and the browser itself can determine if
a MitM is occurring (assuming it is being regularly updated). This was
how the Comodo/Iran breach (2011?) was detected. Firefox and IE are now
also using pinning, but I'm not sure to what degree.
I think that the Perspectives/Convergence approach is probably the
best: rely on others' reports about whether a certificate is
legitimate. This should demonstrate if a local adversary (e.g.
government) is trying to intercept the comms (your certificate is
different to everyone else's). This also means that a CA hierarchy is
no longer required.
You really need to determine who you can trust. Trusting CAs used to be
good enough for most people (i.e. people who are protecting their
financial transactions and email and not their lives) however this no
longer appears to be the case. Certificate pinning secures your
connections to specific, well known sites, if you trust the browser
vendors. Perspectives/Convergence means trusting a distributed group of
people who run notaries that crowd source information from end users
who are trying to be more secure; but even here you need to trust the
technology behind the system and that the system can't be gamed by a
well-resourced adversary.
One final option is something like the way SSH generally works in
practice: trust and accept the certificate the first time you see it
and then notice if it changes. Unfortunately this one isn't practical
because most certificates change on a regular basis and there's no way
to verify that the change was legitimate. You can treat
Perspectives/Convergence as an advanced version of this.
If anyone else knows of some other good plugins or approaches then I'm
also looking for more options.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Terminology: Deep v Dark Web 
Hi all,
I have a question or two about terminology in use when discussing
non-indexable portions of the web.
Relevant terms I see are "deep web" and "dark web", with occasional
references to "dark Internet". Definitions which I use, and which seem
to be reasonably popular are:
  - Deep web:      Sites not easily indexable (dynamic pages, pages
                   not referenced from others, sites hidden behind
                   authentication, etc)
  - Dark web:      Sites not accessible from the open Internet (Tor
                   hidden services, I2P eepsites, etc)
  - Dark Internet: Unroutable IP space (unallocated, sink holes, etc)
If I am correct about these definitions then statements such as the
following the recent Businessweek article[0] are a little misleading:
  In addition to facilitating anonymous communication online, Tor is an
  access point to the "dark Web," vast reaches of the Internet that are
  intentionally kept hidden and don't show up in Google or other search
  engines, often because they harbor the illicit, from child porn to
  stolen credit card information.
References to illicit material are probably unavoidable, however one
thing which may be addressable is the definition of "dark web" which
often seems to imply that it is enormous. (That's assuming that the dark
web isn't actually enormous, and to my reckoning it doesn't appear to
So are there any useful stats on the size of the dark web? (And the
deep web for that matter.) ISTR EFF discussing the deep web years ago
but can't find a reference (and I may be getting confused with their
Deeplinks blog); and I've rediscovered Andrew's report from 2012[1]
noting that the dark web is often seen as being "dark and scary".
If there were some stats which pointed out, e.g., that the deep web
(including all those non-indexable pages in those big corporations
where many work) is far larger that the regular Internet, and that
*that* is far larger than the scary and illicit dark web, it may be
useful for putting things in perspective. I realise that such stats
would be hard to get, but assuming that some approximation is available
it may make a good reference.
(Current stats that I can find (e.g. [2],[3] as a random sample) seem to
indicate that the deep web is 500 times larger than the public
Internet without any real references; Wikipedia provides some quite old

Thanks krishna, and thanks for the update to the page.
I agree that there's a lot of non-web traffic which could be considered
dark, as Lars also pointed out. I'm looking from a web point of view as
this is what is meant by media organisations, and I imagine by most end
users. I'm trying to capture what would be thought of as websites but
which cannot be directly accessed from the open Internet.
It would be nice to include p2p/gaming/voice networks too. The
differentiation for me is where there's an overlay network. So are
BitTorrent/VPN/VoIP/etc networks overlays? I would say yes.
Gaming/email networks? Maybe not. Where does a protocol/suite stop and
a network begin? Wikipedia has a good definition:
    An overlay network is a computer network which is built on the top of
  another network. Nodes in the overlay can be thought of as being
  connected by virtual or logical links, each of which corresponds to a
  path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network.
  For example, distributed systems such as cloud computing,
  peer-to-peer networks, and client-server applications are overlay
  networks because their nodes run on top of the Internet. The Internet
  was originally built as an overlay upon the telephone network while
  today (through the advent of VoIP), the telephone network is
  increasingly turning into an overlay network built on top of the
  Internet.
For me, an overlay network is a basic requirement for a dark network -
you need to do/use something other than your 'normal' software to get
to it. But for it to be a dark net then it also provides access to
something which you can't reach from the open Internet. A/The dark web
is just a subset of a dark network, as the web is a subset of the
That's my take. I'll try to work some of the above into the page over

New Identity works from both TBB and Vidalia. The difference is that
from TBB the entire browser closes and restarts and you lose open tabs.
When choosing a new identity from Vidalia the browser remains open.

Good points.
I've modified the end of the deep web definition from:

"and information which resides behind authentication such as on private
organizational networks and public networks such as Facebook."
I toyed with the idea of mentioning "walled gardens" as in the article
but I don't think that it would be a correct term here. Apple certainly
operates a walled garden, but this doesn't restrict which parts of the
web that people can get to, it's more about controlling the
applications. (Through which, or course, they can control access to
"dark" nets such as Tor and I2P, so they do indirectly control
access ... but then there are proxies to get around this ... we're
descending into a deep rabbit hole here!)

Luther Blissett:
It does seem to be difficult to get a perfect description. Rick
suggested "commercial" which I don't really think sums it up. "Open" is
misleading to me because access is often filtered by governments or
ISPs. I see "public" as a good compromise, meaning access to the
"regular" Internet, something that the general public can get to.
Whether it is through a home DSL line or a city or Starbucks WiFi
doesn't matter too much (to me).
Yes, and I've noted in the article that "filtering/censorship by
governments and ISPs" can be performed.
Yes, the article defines:   Web: the portion of the Internet which is accessible via a web
       browser; the World Wide Web. Getting this message across to non-technical people is hard. For many
the web *is* the Internet.
Yes, the private portions become the "deep web" in my definition. Not
"dark", just not searchable/accessible. Where software or hardware
which is not immediately available to users is involved I see that as
I disagree here. The dark web is the portion which is not accessible
from regular web clients and not done in the open, e.g. Tor hidden
services and I2P eepsites. I've also noted in the article that if we
consider dark *networks* instead of just the dark web then we also
should include VPN, P2P, VoIP and other overlay networks.
"Dark" can be associated with that which westerners do not comprehend:
that is in part, I think, what the Tor Project is trying to combat
through its "Who Uses Tor?" articles. Web 2.0 may be marketing
bullshit, but it's generally accepted and therefore needs to be
addressed. I'm hoping to document useful definitions and at the same
time dispel the myth that the dark web is many times larger than the
public web. While it's possible to just ignore the 99% it doesn't
really help the situation, and it certainly doesn't help expand the
reach and usefulness of Tor.
That's my view. If you come up with a better definition than "public"
then please update the article! My only wish is that any other term
will be understood by and useful for the 99% as they are ultimately the
target audience.

Thomas White:
Hi Thomas,
It would be interesting to see big sites out there providing more
resources within the Tor network, i.e. offering hidden services
themselves. Maybe this could be an area of exploration: rather than
hosting sites yourself, provide information, encouragement and advice
to others to run their own HS. Maybe run a HS which is just a proxy
into their clear web site, with their permission, as an initial step?
This could be combined with a change to HTTPS Everywhere to prefer HS
sites over clear web sites, just as it prefers HTTPS over HTTP. (I
think this has been mentioned before?)
This would lead towards an environment where there is less need to
leave the Tor network itself. Many providers are completing the
end-to-end model and also encrypting their internal links, the next
logical step may be to operate within an environment which is outside
the reach of state monitoring, or at least further from their grasp.
(This could lead to further Balkanisation of the Internet, and could
also lead to more direct competition between Tor and I2P ... but I'd
wager that this won't increase the likelihood of Balkanisation, and
competition should be good for both projects.)
Slightly off-topic: if use of hidden services is going to expand then
this may be an opportune time to ensure that they will continue to work
into the future, e.g. who is going to own the .onion TLD? Should the
Tor Project make a bid for it? Should HS change the way they are
addressed? I don't know how the code works now, but I assume that there
is something which stops DNS lookups of .onion domains and just
redirects them toward a HS lookup. What happens when the Oxnard Chamber
of Commerce claims that TLD?

Yes, a reverse proxy would just be a tool to help an organisation
transition into running a HS, and should be performed in conjunction
with the organisation. This should be part of a campaign to encourage
organisations to participate in Tor.
I think we're pretty much in agreement here.

That being said, another option is to ditch the CAs and and use a TOFU
(trust on first use) and certificate transparency approach for .onion
domains within TBB. That gives us self-signed certificates and
reasonable security without warnings being presented to the user. The

Facebook doesn't have an EV certificate at all! They same cert is
present on their clear web and HS sites.
And, IMHO, I don't think that this is the list for solving the CA
problem. If we can get a visibly encrypted page displayed to a user
without a warning then that's probably good enough.
  "We decided to use SSL atop this service due in part to architectural
   considerations - for example, we use the Tor daemon as a reverse
   proxy into a load balancer and Facebook traffic requires the
   protection of SSL over that link. As a result, we have provided an
   SSL certificate which cites our onion address; this mechanism
   removes the Tor Browser's ?SSL Certificate Warning? for that onion
   address and increases confidence that this service really is run by
   Facebook. Issuing an SSL certificate for a Tor implementation is -
   in the Tor world - a novel solution to attribute ownership of an
   onion address; other solutions for attribution are ripe for
   consideration, but we believe that this one provides an appropriate
   starting point for such discussion."
I certainly agree that the CA system is not ideal and that we must
assume that users know nothing about security (and rightly so), but
we've struggled to get the current system working somewhat reliably for
end users for nigh on 20 years and it will be difficult to suddenly
change direction.
Where we can assume a technically literate user then alternate
solutions should be possible, but I do wonder whether it is worth the
effort. Even for something like Bitcoin where we can currently assume
that the user has some understanding of security, a different solution
would have a major impact if/when the service becomes popular with less
technical users. Any solution should just work. Chrome is moving
towards this with certificate pinning: displaying "I'm sorry Dave, I'm
afraid I can't let you do that" when the certificate doesn't match
An alternative may be to somehow tie a hidden service's private key to
that of the certificate and then allow TBB or Tor to perform the
validation. I'm not sure how it would work technically, but it seems
like a logical step.

Hopefully someone else can answer this. I've run hidden services and
can confirm that they can be discovered, but I'm not sure on the
best/preferred discovery methods.

blobby at openmailbox.org:
I have had very few problems with Yandex and GMX. Yandex sometimes
blocks IMAPS connections, but a change of exit node fixes that. No
issues with either via the web interface.

Oskar Wendel:
I rarely have problems with Yandex. Sometimes it doesn't allow an IMAP
connection so I simply choose a new identity from TBB. GMX also works
well. Both support SMTP and IMAP over Tor and both have web interfaces.

I use common email providers, I sign up and access them via Tor. So,
for example, I signed up to this provider (Yandex) using Tor, and I
ensure that I only ever connect using Tor. That way, I get the
anonymity I require while using well known providers and my email does
not end up in the SPAM folder.
Yandex, GMX and ProtonMail all work well. None are perfect and there
are times when I can't connect via Tor and need to use the New Identity
feature, but these three are pretty good.

Random User:
I use Claws Mail and torsocks, so technically yes, but that probably
doesn't answer your question.
I don't use the web interface, and it has been a while since I created
a new account. Even then, I tend to leave TBB settings at default, so
I'm not sure.

... except ProtonMail. I only use a clear net account there at the
moment. When I was accessing it over Tor I was was using the default
security settings, so I was probably using JS.

It's really not all that hard. Move that security slider up to high and
Yandex has a light version that works without JS. The others require it.
You now owe me 5 minutes of internet.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browsers - problem with sequencial runs 
J B:
Not sure if this is related, but I occasionally see that TBB doesn't
completely exit when I close it down (running on Linux).
Doesn't seem to matter whether I close the window, File->Quit or
CTRL-Q. Also doesn't appear to depend on how long TBB has been running
or how many windows I have had open.
It does seem to depend on how many different sites I've been to, so I'm
leaning towards something going slightly haywire based on a site I'm
visiting, but have never been able to figure out what or which. I end up
using ps or lsof to find the PID and then just kill it. Has been going
on for a long time over many major releases, but I've never had enough
information to log a ticket.
