Yes, that was my understanding as well. Thanks for the clarification.
I looked elsewhere in my code and realised that the shared signature
code added an extra \n after "directory-signature " when verifying
consensus documents. I got extremely confused because I could verify
both router descriptor and key certificate documents.
In other words: My bad, i.e. I needed someone to talk to. :-)
Sorry for the noise
