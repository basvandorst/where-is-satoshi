@_subject: [tor-talk] How to prevent to leak my local ip 
I saw a non-free software to prevent Local IP leak. If I use this program, IP2.exe can't get my local IP(not 127.0.0.1, not 0.0.0.0). As I know, this program may use sandbox.
Is there function like that in Tor? If I use transparent proxy, Can't All of programs  get my local IP(ex. 192.168.1.1)
Or if I use Whonix, am I safe from leaking local IP Address?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Can Tor users be tracked? 
Hello. I saw a blog post in Internet. It says the government can track Tor user with plugin like active-x and javascript. Is it true?
And what should I do not to be tracked?

Does ISP can track Tor users?
So, shouldn't I use active-x and flash?
Sorry. I have a poor English so I understand this JavaScript can't track my ip but can track other information like timezone, macaddress, and windows user name. I think there are some misunderstanding. Am I understand right?
And I have one more question. Sometimes, I can't load Torcheck page *with tor*. Can my government and my ISP can block torcheck page if I use Tor?

So, using JavaScript is safe if there were no security exploits?

I saw some Internet pages. In there, they can know my ip with JavaScript in spite of using Tor.
I can't believe this but I am worried about this.
Is it true?

I want to know whether my program leaks my ip. So I found wireshark.
I want to check ip leak so I studied wireshark. But I don't know about wireshark filters well. I want to know there are my ip leaks include my packets contents. Not only dns leak. If I use filter "host (my ip address and port (port that my programs use)", can I know it?
Or should I use filter "ip.addr.=(my ip address)"?
And if there are packets with that filter config, can I convince that my program is leaking?

Due to many sexual illegal behavior, Korean government started to block sexual video about under-18-old people(=underage video)
Nowadays, in south korea, they started to arrest people who download underage video due to child-teen law(in Korean, ???) However, there is big problem. If the title of underage sexual video include "teen"or "school uniform", although people in that video is adult,

I think there is some misunderstanding.
Child pornography without child means video whose character looks under-19-year-old or wears a school uniform and animation whose character looks under-19-years old. However, there are a few sexual scenes in video, the video is child pornography. There is no principle.  If south Korean police want to arrest netizen who download that video, they do it even Korean is democracy society.

How to verify signatures for packages
When I tried to verify signatures with GPA, gpg frontend, it was failed. I download Tor packages in torproject.org https version.
Strangely, when I tried to verify with GPG command line, it was success. Is it tor's asc file problem? Or is it GPA bug so should I report this problem to GPA project? My feeling is like headache.
I hope my Tor browser file is real.
I'll wait your wise answer. I'll Thank you for answering.

Error message was bad signature. I guess GPA may be able to only verify when Sign is in signed file.
Thanks your advise

@_subject: [tor-talk] Unable to access Tor website 
Hi, Tor-list!
Recently, I think South Korea government is starting sensoring Tor. A few days ago, I sent the mail to Tor-talk list about website problem. This thread is related to that.
I used Tor for a year, and there was no problem using Tor. However, I couldn't use Tor official website. I tried to connect Tor website with "SK telecom" 3G network. And there is blog post that explaining Tor website error[1].
In that post, a bloger said "??? ??? ??? ? ??? ?? ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???????"(In English, I have a doubt that The government(of south Korea) is taking action about blocking Tor website because when i use proxy, I can access Tor website.). In my opinion, I agree this.
Moreover, "??? ?(Failed tool):JonDo, Freegate, AdvTor, Ultrasurf, Hotspot shield." is there!
In that post, to download Tor, he recommended using "hide my ass". My first question, is it dangerous because of unknown sever and non-ssl connection?
I can connect Tor network without  bridges, Tor wiki, Tor blog, Tor-talk mailing list and Tor git page.
I think using Gettor is good. Am I believe Gettor service?
I never believe Tor websever has a problem so long. South Korea government shouldn't sensor Tor website.  Is there anyone to give me a good idea or advise, please?
Anyway, THANKS TOR PROJECT

@_subject: [tor-talk] New idea for bypassing censorship 
In my country, some site is blocked and blocked site is redirected to warning.go.kr , site about sensoring information.
So, how about using Tor only when warning.go.kr is detected?
In Normal case, I can use Internet via normal network. However in sensorship case, some program makes me use Tor auto, not manually.
Is there program like that?
P.S I have poor English so sorry for that.
