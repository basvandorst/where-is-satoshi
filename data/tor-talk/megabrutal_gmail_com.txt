@_subject: [tor-talk] Obfsproxy: Multiple ServerTransportListenAddr lines & 
I want Obfsproxy to listen on both IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces by using
the following lines in torrc:
ServerTransportPlugin obfs2,obfs3 exec /usr/bin/obfsproxy managed
ServerTransportListenAddr obfs2 0.0.0.0:42862
ServerTransportListenAddr obfs3 0.0.0.0:49991
ServerTransportListenAddr obfs2 [2001:xxxx::63:7572:6c79]:42862
ServerTransportListenAddr obfs3 [2001:xxxx::63:7572:6c79]:49991
I noticed, only the first line gets interpreted for each Obfsproxy
protocol. I can force to listen only on IPv6 by commenting out the
lines for IPv4, but I'd prefer to have a dual-stack bridge.
I don't remember having this behaviour the first time I installed an
Obfsproxy bridge. If I remember correctly, it worked previously, but
meanwhile it is broken.
Anyway, I just noticed, there is a new protocol, obfs4, but I don't
know anything about it. Should I adopt this new protocol? If so, how
can I do that? Is it already available in the DEB repository at
 What is the minimal Ubuntu
release for which it is available?

@_subject: [tor-talk] webmail send while using TOR is tagged as spamends 
2016-07-19 7:13 GMT+02:00 Friet Pan :
It was tagged as SPAM, but luckily I always check my SPAM folder for
false positives, so I unspammed it. This helps GMail to learn that
this message is safe.
To be precise, I'm not entirely sure whether your mail was tagged as
SPAM, or me's message who replied to it about an hour ago, since GMail
organizes conversations into threads, and I just found the thread in
the SPAM folder.
Oh, boy... Flagging TOR-related messages as SPAM is only the top of
the iceberg. The e-mail system is already very discriminative in order
to filter SPAM, which would otherwise take the majority of mail
traffic. Innocent until proven guilty does not apply here. For
example, some providers block dynamic IPs by default. It bothers me
because I run my own mail server from a dynamic IP, and I don't think
it is fair to block my messages just because I happen to be sending
them from a dynamically allocated IP, while I have no history of
sending SPAM. Luckily, most providers use Spamhaus, and Spamhaus has a
quick de-listing procedure, so every time my IP changes, I need to go
to Spamhaus to de-list my IP. But it still causes a little pain in the
ass. Not to mention that others may use a different blacklist, for
example SORBS, which does not allow de-listing (or they have a long,
complicated de-listing procedure, and in the end they would not allow
me to de-list my dynamic IPs anyway).
So, can I sue those who list or block my messages because I send them
from a dynamic IP? I don't think so. The case is not very different
with TOR. For the higher anonimity of Tor, it has an even higher risk
of SPAM, significantly higher than dynamic IPs – who knows, maybe the
exit node you use was already used by spammers who were really sending
SPAM out through Tor. Since there is no way to discern the users of a
Tor exit node, there is no way to tell that you are not the same
spammer who was sending spam through the same node earlier. If you
think about it, Tor would be ideal for spammers to send spam, so
likely they use it.
It sucks. Well-intentioned people are blocked because OTHERS were
abusing services by spamming, or even worse, by using Tor to relay
their SPAM, which is not really the purpose of Tor. Since there is no
way to discern the good users from the bad ones, there is no way to
solve this problem.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Bridge and Hidden service 
If I'm about to run a Hidden service, can I run it on a bridge node,
or at least on the same IP as a bridge node without uncovering the
bridge node?
Maybe it boils down to the question whether a node that serves a
Hidden service has to be a public Tor node. If it has to be public, it
spoils the IP.
Moreover, can I make a Tor node to only serve the Hidden service and
not to relay regular Tor traffic? I mean, my node should only serve
incoming traffic to the Hidden service.
Thanks for your help in advance,
