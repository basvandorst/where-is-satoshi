I am Y Bhargav a 2nd year B.Tech student from IIIT Hyderabad. I am
very much fond of mathematics and while going through the organisations
for the GSOC-2014 I found this one very interesting and attractive. I
thought this
would be a great idea for me to work on this . So , I have gone through
your Ideas
page and found the following ideas interesting :
I would like to work on the above mentioned topics because I have quite a
idea on C,python
I am also looking forward to the help from the mentors
Looking forward to work with Tor. Given a chance I would put my fullest
effort and
work to your complete satisfaction
Thanks !!

any list of known bugs??
