@_subject: Privoxy and Java Re: Building tracking system to nab Tor 
Privoxy routes DNS through TOR.
Question: does Java in a browser run through the browser's IP stack? If so, its DNS packets would go through the SOCKS proxy and Privoxy, then TOR.  Right?

@_subject: How would tor defend from this attack? 
Your proposal is quite realistic, though to get good bi-directional bandwidth would probably cost a lot more than you project, as you'd want colocated servers, not servers on DSL lines.
I believe that the exit nodes are one of the weakest points in a Tor network.  If you don't know who is operating them, they can do all kinds of monitoring, modification and other mayhem (eg. inject zero day exploits and malware into your browsing traffic).
Ways to route traffic through "trusted" exit nodes, and ways to provably show that routes are via independent operators is probably useful.  This line of thinking moves one toward contracts, companies, The other approach is to have so many routers that a Sybil attack is not possible.  But that means turning every user into a Tor node.  I still maintain that unknown exit nodes are dangerous even in a world with 100,000 Tor nodes or 1 million nodes.

Good write-up of the Tor storm worm variant at f-secure blog
For those not tracking the storm worm... this has been one of the most prolific worms of recent months.  It's the same thing behind the fake youtube emails, e-greeting card infections and the various "account confirmation" attacks (eg online gambling account confirmation) , etc.
More about storm
hi all,
I've just received a really odd spam which try to "educate" to the use of
tor as an attack vector.
Here's the body of the mail (turn off javascript before trying to visit
that link ;-) ):
Do you trade files online? Then they will come after you. Read the news on
RIAA and what they are doing to everyone they find. Tor will keep them
from finding you. Keep the internet private and down load our program for
free. Download Tor
A quick "strings" on their version of tor.exe shows something like
"RealShellExecuteA" and similar stuff.

     Somewhere on the order of 500 new relays or so seem to have appeared
in the tor network in the past week.  I take this as a very welcome event,
not only for the future of the tor network and enhanced performance of the
network, but because it suggests that quite a lot of people have become
more aware of the need for network anonymity.
     What bothers me a trifle is that the timing of all this also suggests
that it has been triggered by the ruckus over the recent election in Iran.
I hope that most of the new tor nodes will stick around for the long haul
after the situation in Iran has quiesced, rather than simply being up for
a few weeks and then vanishing again.
     Either way, though, I welcome them all for as long as their operators
are willing to help out by running relays.

@_subject: private vs. public tor network ... any other options ? 
We run a private Tor-based network.  Email Steve (sms or I for questions.
What we have contemplated is operating the exit nodes, and mixing into the public Tor network for either the middle or both middle and entry nodes.  You could select high bandwidth middle-nodes for this, which would give you reasonably high performance, yet you would have 1-2-or more public nodes in between the user and the exit node.  This would provide increased anonymity, while preserving performance and security of the exit nodes (protecting against mal-nodes).
The thought was also to select those middle nodes based on measured performance.
-----Original Message-----
If you limit yourself to a small set of nodes, you
will definitely compromise your anonymity against a powerful attacker. But
what if you're not worried about a powerful attacker, or serious anonymity?
What if you just want a casual observer to think you're using Tor, and leave
it at that?
You could run two relays on each node you control. One relay would be part
of the public tor network, and limit the bandwidth to a (large) fraction of
what you have available. One relay would be part of your private tor network
and use the rest of the available bandwidth. You'd have to bootstrap your
tor network from scratch, and set up an authority, and so on. Then you could
run your local tor client on your private network, and have a small set of
fast nodes available to you. A casual observer at either end (you-hop1 or
hop3-internet) would see the traffic from/to a tor node, and assume that it
was truly torified. Depending what you personally think the threat profile
is - and I'd suggest reading some of the research to find out what threats
to consider - you might want to use an entry point or exit node on the
regular network, or do other circuit manipulation.
Note that trying to take advantage of your own resources inevitably limits
your anonymity potential. Customizing your network also means that you won't
benefit as much, or at all, from upgrades to Tor. However, if all you want
is casually anonymous browsing at high speed, this may be useful to you.
Nonetheless, I make no guarantees that the system you set up will be
sufficiently anonymous for you.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hijacking Advertising to give a Tor Exit 
AnchorFree is doing Multi-millions of dollars of business doing targeted ads on a "free" proxy/vpn service. I don't see why this couldn't be done with Tor.
For whatever it's worth, this seems to be a common model for a number of free VPN and Glype-style Web-based providers, who cater to clients attempting to get around content filtering. I've been interested in the mechanics and economics of the approach, but haven't yet had time to do any investigation.
Perhaps the user doesn't *want* those "useful" things done for him.
Perhaps he knows what he is doing and is already doing *exactly* what he
wants to do.  Very slippery slope!
(Not that I think there is a remote chance that such an exit node would
not be marked as a bad exit just on general principles.  I just wanted
to point out that I find this "nanny state" attitude of "we know better
than you" offensive.  It's bad enough when ISPs break NXDOMAIN, etc.
Although I doubt that you meant any harm.  :-)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor compromised? 
I went to French bilingual school through high school.  its rusty, but here's additional info:
He mapped TOR bridges and included them in the attack vector.  These IPs will be published in November.   He claims that 30% of entry nodes and bridges run Windows and are subject to privilege escalation, hence takeover or "reduction in security" of the first 2 layers of encryption (via memory inspection and tampering, as has already been discussed).
No claims about exit nodes.
