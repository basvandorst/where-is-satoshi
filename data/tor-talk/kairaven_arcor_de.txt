the installer version for Windows
doesn't work under my Windows 2000 system, perhaps the file is
corrupted (downloaded with wget and firefox):

Hi Robin,
Mmh, with pre6 and rc1 the installer works.

gpg: die unterzeichneten Daten sind wohl in 'tor-0.0.9rc1-win32.exe'

@_subject: Tor Network response slowing to zero 
Hi Roger,
As a Tor user i think, it is necessary and right to block all filesharing
ports for the moment until Tor gets more big nodes and expands as a whole. Imo
it is more important, that users - especially from countries with autoritarian
regimes - can use the fundamental services of the internet as to suck the next
movie over P2P.
To help Tor at the moment, i have stopped the use of Tor with Jabber/IRC a few
days ago. I have also startet a second Privoxy process on another port without
forwarding to Tor and added a profile to SwitchProxy so i can use Tor
selective for the web, for example i don't need Tor to access and post something
into my blog ;)

of HTTP Error Code 404: Ressource not found messages ;)

@_subject: Tor exit nodes by country 
Hi Roger,
Very useful. I have asked myself, why no options exist to exlude specific
entry or exit nodes like the general ExcludeNodes or RendExcludeNodes options
resp. as counterpart to the StrictEntry|ExitNodes options. Something like
ExludeEntryNodes and ExcludeExitNodes.
Perhaps it is easier or useful, if sombody lives in a country, where he doesn't
want that traffic is going to a node in his country?

@_subject: tor_resolve 
i'm testing Tor 0.9.2 for Windows under W2K (vmware).
Tor is running fine with Privoxy, but If i try to use tor_resolve, i get:
Jan 15 11:40:40.392 [debug] main(): defaulting to localhost:9050
Jan 15 11:40:40.392 [err] do_resolve(): Error while creating_socket: Successful
WSAStartup not yet performed [WSANOTINITIALISED ]
What does this mean or how can i avoid this error?

Hi Roger,
i have asked a friend with
Microsoft Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 (Build 2600)
Version 5.1 (Build 2600) SP 2.0, Service Pack 2
to test tor_resolve. He gets the same error.

@_subject: silky and tor 
is anybody able to use the graphical SILC client silky together with Tor and
I have compiled socat and silky 0.5.4. Following the Torify Howto, i have
started socat with
socat -d -d -d -D TCP4-LISTEN:1706
and tried to connect with localhost:1706.
But i get always something like that:
[11:56] Connecting to server 'localhost'...
[11:56] Connection to server is expired
A test with x-chat showed me, that a connection from x-chat to socat &
socat to tor was established, but with silky nothing works for me.

@_subject: Firefox extensions and anonymity, TOR etc 
I can only say, that i have used a Chinese Tor Exit Node on the occasion
of the anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre and the RSF messages
about the blocking of google.com and sites like  and chinadigitaltimes.net. I wasn't able to access
these sites, but google.com, indeed without success with a search for
"Falung Gong". I don't believe, that all Chinese Tor Nodes are
governmental honeypots, but that their requests are blocked anywhere
inside the "great firewall" of China.

@_subject: Threats to anonymity set at and above the application layer; 
Hi Seth,
For this reasons i have changed the Accept-Language and User-Agent
header, but only for the locale. But
for OS, browser version (User-Agent) i'm often reading, that it is
necessary to fake the informations with the User-Agent header for
anonymity purposes. Imo the opposite is true. I'm sharing the same OS
and OS version, the same browser version with a lot of people, who have
installed the same.
I think, i have my headers (according to e. g.
 and using the German Firefox
HTTP_USER_AGENT: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US;
rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3
in common with a crowd of other "normal" users. Or with Linux - ok,
distributions have their specific builds of Firefox, but all or a lot of
users are using this build too, so i can hide myself in this crowd, if
the number of people is large enough. At the same time, i'm hiding, that
i'm a user from Germany.
Using a header like
HTTP_USER_AGENT: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; en-US) Firefox
i would "tag" myself.
Or i'm wrong? Perhaps, i'm too optimistic, that users are using always
an actual browser version, when i'm looking at the date and version field.
Ack. For this reasons, i have deactivated all functions for script,
cookie or ad filtering and header manipulation by simply commenting the
actionsfile options in the main configuration file.
# actionsfile standard  # Internal purpose, recommended
# actionsfile default   # Main actions file
# actionsfile user      # User customizations
So, Privoxy is only used as a wrapper for Tor (i don't like the Firefox
builtin socks_remote_dns function ) and i can only see, that Privoxy adds
May 20 08:29:14 Privoxy(02960) Header: addh-unique: Host: May 20 08:29:14 Privoxy(01136) Header: addh: X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
For the handling of cookies, ads and scripts, i'm using Adblock,
NoScript, CookieButton and CookieCuller. Ok, that is difficult or
unusable in a networked environment with the need of centralized proxy
and client management.
See above...couldn't default configurations and standardized browsers
if not used by all users?
I think, a Privoxy version with deactivated actions (or a simple, free
and secure socks_wrapper as a replacement for Privoxy) and a database with
User-Agent and Accept-Language headers (more relevant headers?) of
all browsers in all languages, as shipped by the OS or browser vendor
together with a short explanation, how to switch them permanently
(about:config, useragent...) or temporary with Extensions like User
Agent Switcher or PrefBar would be more useful.
