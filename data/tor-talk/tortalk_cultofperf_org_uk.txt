@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor on Raspberry Pi 
I've had a bit of a poke around the list archives here but this doesn't seem to have been discussed on this list in the last couple of months.
A lot of people want to support Tor but setting up and running a server is a bit tricky. I think it'd be good to have a Raspberry Pi distro such that you can plug your RaspPi into your Internet connection, stick in an SD card with a pre-prepared distribution, and it boots up, uses DHCP and uPNP to get networking and portforwarding, and runs a Tor bridge / middle node.
Obviously there's a bit more to it than that - particularly if you wanted it to be usable by people on the same LAN - but I think that's a reasonable first This seemed like a pretty obvious application of RaspPi to me, so I'm wondering whether anybody else is working on it. It's not a million miles away from the Torouter project, but it's also quite close to a custom distro of Raspian with certain packages preinstalled and configured out of the box.
What do others think?
