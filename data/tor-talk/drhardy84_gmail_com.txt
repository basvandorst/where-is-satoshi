I've been trying for several days to install Tor on OpenBSD 5.6 with hopes
of setting up a relay.
OpenBSD uses the Korn Shell.
When I try to tar the downloaded Tor browser file I get:
(*tar xvJf tor-browser-linux64-4.0.4_en-US.tar.xz*)
gzip: stdin: unrecognized file format
tar:  end of archive volume 1 reached
tar:  Sorry, unable to determine archive format
So I tried it using the Bash shell and got the exact same results.
I feel like I've missed something but am not sure what.
Has anyone here tried this?
Thanks for any advice.

Hi, Daniel,
I tried the "pkg_add" and got "quirks-2.9 signed on 2014-07-31T22:37:55Z"
And that was it.  I guess the next step is to work through the anoncvs procedures and compile
it myself.

There were no specific download instructions for BSD on the Tor download
page that I noticed.  The header is for Linux and BSD there.  I would gladly
write them up if I can get this to work.
Unpacking the tor-0.2.5.11.tar.gz gets me:  "tar:  Cpio file name length
xxxxxx is out of range" and then "tar: End of archive volume 1 reached"
No luck updating LibreSSL yet, either.

The Tor on OpenBSD project continues here.
I went through all the suggested procedures, launched Tor and now I get
"Tor has successfully opened a circuit. Looks like client functionality is
"Bootstrapped 100%: Done"
But nothing happens and the shell just hangs there.
