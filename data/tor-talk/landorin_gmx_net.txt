@_subject: German laws and tor 
I just joined this mailing list and sadly the welcome mail did not
indicate how exactly I can respond to another posting, so hopefully I
did it the right way now.
I'm studying laws right now (but don't believe I'm an expert now!) but I
can't give you a direct answer about ?9.
The point is, paragraphs can be used/interpreted in different ways, thus
it really depends on the arguments of a lawyer or judge. Additionally,
each judge may decide differently about a case. So if a judge from an
"Amtsgericht" (lowest German court) decides that you are responsible for
the traffic going through your TOR server, the judge of a "Landgericht"
(next higher court instance) might say the opposite. It's not like in
the USA where (as far as I know) people can rely on a similar case which
was judged by any court. The only exception is when a "Bundesgericht"
(and "BGH/BVerfG") decides on a case. That decision is valid for
everyone then (a court decision of a lower court is often followed by
persons and companies, but it's not binding as well as it is not valid
for everyone; just the involved persons).
So what does that mean for German TOR users? Unless a "Bundesgericht"
decides on this specific question, the answer could be yes as well as
no, it really depends on how the court decides. So in theory, you could
safely use TOR as well as you can't safely use it (since the judge might
claim you're responsible for the traffic and then you have to accept it
or go to the next higher court and hope it decides differently). I guess
with a good lawyer one could go up the courts one by one until one gets
the decision one wants. ;)
My advice: in doubt, don't be an exit node and instead become a
middleman node (add ExitPolicy reject *:* to your tor configuration).
That way your IP won't show up on a website or so if someone is browsing
through your node, so theoretically no one can tell the traffic from a
person went through your node and can't hold you responsible.

@_subject: Wiki about usage of vservers still up to date? / What are descriptors? 
Hello everyone,
Since I just joined this mailing list, I don't know whether this
question has already been updated/answered. If so, I apologize.
The wiki says you can't use TOR with a vserver (virtual server; several
people have their own virtual server on one real server and they have to
share its hardware) because TOR needs to connect to 1024 descriptors.
Is that still valid/up to date or has this changed yet?
Also, what are descriptors and how do I know if a server/vserver is able
to connect to 1024 descriptors?

@_subject: Weird behavior of my server 
Hi all,
Okay I just registered my TOR server (nickname: Anti1984, it's running
on my home PC). However, I'm still confused about something:
When I have the Dirport enabled, the server consumes sometimes the max
upload bandwith I have which affects VoIP for example. From what I read
in the documentation, "BandwidthRate" only limits the incoming traffic
so apparently I can't limit the upload bandwith for the server (?) (FAQ
Wiki 5.17 quote " It only looks at incoming bytes, not outgoing so maybe
you should disable DirPort.").
Okay, so I disable my DirPort (and in general, I don't know how much
bandwith a server should have/offer the least for enabling the Dirport)
and now I hardly see any traffic (if any, it's less than 2 kb/s or so)
and the Tor Network Status website shows my server with something
between 2000 and 6000 bytes/s only.
First I thought it's because TOR will route the users to faster servers
first and only relying on the slower ones if necessary. But then I
thought "browsing with TOR is significantly slower, that might or might
not mean there is are more users than bandwith available". In case
that's true, then TOR would have to use my server for routing, too.
Apparently, this might not be the case.
So anything I oversaw in the documentation?

Yeah, that's a big issue. Due to that WSAENOBUFS I'm forced to restart
it quite often. :/ Today, I read about the error in more detail and I
guess, until that bug is fixed I will consider using my VMWare-Ubuntu
(pretty nice to use in Windows if you got not much clue about Linux,
works like a player setting up an image file, really recommendable). I
just don't have much clue about Linux yet but hopefully the installation
guide will take care of every question. ;)
By the way, what would you guys recommend for using or not using the
DirPort? Meaning, how much bandwidth should a server have that it's
recommended to also have the DirPort enabled? Since the Bandwidthrate
option will only limit the incoming traffic my server will probably
consume up to max bandwidth (which is about 47 kb/s)... however, I do
need bandwidth for myself for VoIP etc, so should I enable the DirPort
with that little bandwidth or leave it to the bigger servers?
Okay, okay, it's the mighty Tor the God of thunder. ;) j/k

Can anyone help me with getting this set up? I'm a linux newbie and the
commands such as "deb" described in the linux setup tor guide don't seem
to work in my Ubuntu breezy 5.10 vmware image.
Using apt-get install tor says something like (translated from German):
"couldn't open lock file /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (13 no
can't get a lock on list directory"

Good advice, I did some research and finally got it almost working.
My only problem now is when I type in the following:
sudo etc/init.d/tor start
it displays this:
Apr 27 12:25:49.739 [notice] Tor v0.1.0.17. This is experimental
software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity.
But that's the only line I get. if I stop the server it claims the
process isn't running.
If I put a comment symbol ( before the "Address" parameter it gives
me the error message that adress "ubuntu" is pointing to the localhost
IP and can't be used. However, if I remove the # and put in my public
IP adress behind "address" or the dynamic DNS adress it just gives me
the single line and doesn't start the server.
On XP having the Address line active with my public IP or the dynamic
DNS it all works fine.
Could it be a problem because I have Ubuntu 5.10 running as a VMWare
image? If so, what can I do to fix this?
P.S.: I did remove the whole package and reinstalled it again without
a difference.

I believe so, I always run it with sudo (for some unknown reason, I
can't logon with the root user in this VMWare Ubuntu). I did change
the config file to bind the orport to 443.
Thanks, I thought the log only logs what it showed me before (the
single line). ;)
Here's what the log says, that might be the issue:
"Could not bind to port 443: Permission denied
[err] options_act(): Failed to bind one of the listeners ports."
Well, after all, I don't have that much clue yet about Linux user
rights. I try starting the server with "sudo", from what I learned
today, that should give me all the necessary admin (?) rights to run a
program. So what is the mistake?

Okay, I just tried out a different orport and now the server starts
up. So somehow either port 443 is blocked already by something else or
it's because the permission is denied (since it's a blank Ubuntu I
guess it's the permission thing). Anything I can do about it?

Okay, I'll try that out, thanks.
I just ran into another problem: the orport appears to be unreachable.
I really don't know how the connection works in VMWare environments.
Do I have to forward the orport to the VMWare IP or to my Windows IP?
Also, does it need "bridged", "NAT" or "host-only" mode in VMWare?

I'm behind a NAT router and I run Ubuntu in VMWare.
So that's what I did: I forwarded port 443 to port 9090 in my NAT
router and in the torrc file I had orbindadress 0.0.0.0.:9090 active.
However, it always said my orport is not reachable (after about 20
min). So until I find the cause (if ever) I'll let it run at a higher

@_subject: setting up port forwarding for tor server 
Hi Rouslan,
As far as I know, when using the default ports at least you need is port
80 and 443, at least that's what used as the two default ports (dirport
and orport). From what I know, as a middlenode you only will need 80 and
443 but I'm not completely sure. I only forwarded these ports (had 21
mapped anyway) and the Tor server ran fine.

Hi, nice work, that Vidalia tool seems to be a very good addition for
Tor, it keeps the overview and allows an easier way of setting up the
Tor configuration. However, where do I send feedback to? Will it do
sending it to this mailing list or should I send it directly to the
The only thing I noticed was when starting up the server it checked
for port 443 on adress 0.0.0.0. although the config was set to a
dynamic dns adress. When I manually typed in the config infos into

Hi Olivier,
Wow, that's shocking to read. Honestly, though I'm not that surprised,
this had to happen sooner or later to exit nodes because some people
know how to arrest someone but have no clue about networks and their
possibilities. I feel sorry for the inconvenience that caused for you.
However, this might have a good part, too: at least now you know that
you can run an exit node without getting accused or so (it caused
inconvenience the most, but no accusation or so right?). If that
happened to me then at least I'd know next time they will know about Tor.
Here in Germany I wouldn't dare to run an exit node yet until it was
decided whether they can accuse you for this or not if something like
your case happens because some judges decide total bullshit sometimes
because of not having a clue.
And just like the wiki said: some sick criminal would use other means
to get what he wants if Tor wasn't there and it will always be like
that. It's not us or Tor which is the problem, it's just the pure
nature of evil/madness being the cause of these problems (and
politicians who want to spy on our privacy actually force use to build
these kinds of networks!). Yet nice to read you want to keep up the
good work. :)

You might want to ask the Chaos Computer Club which seems to run an
exit node (check the node list), they are an organisation and might
probably be able to tell you more.
Personally, I believe a "Verein" is usually regarded as one person
(actually "juristische Person") of its own so they don't accuse a
private person but the organisation itself as a person (that's not
guaranteed, it's just what I guess so far). Also, an organisation
might rather afford going through court trials than a single person.
In case that's right an organisation running an exit node here might
be safer for the individual in a case as it happened in France.

I don't get it. Why buy a new one anyway? From what I know, any and
every data will be lost if you format your hardisk with a safe method
(can't remember the name right now but that method keeps writing
random data to your entire hardisk to overwrite existing files and it
does it for 10 times or more to ensure all old data is lost)?

In the end, it's up to you to decide what is necessary to trust your

someone who obviously had nothing to do with the crime, I'd rather
concentrate on finding criminals that can be traced back (and if they
listened to you then they know it's a waste of time in any case
because they can't track anyone back with your PC).
