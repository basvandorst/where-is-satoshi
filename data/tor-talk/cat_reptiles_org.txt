I'd suggest that you start working on a mobile TorCP client yourself[0],
if you're really interested in having one available.
[0] Or find somebody you can pay to do it.

@_subject: Some simple changes to the tor architecture I believe may greatly 
As a quick summary - have you read the mailing list archives?  Most of
the things that you're proposing here have been discussed and beaten
into atomic particles long since.
I'm skipping over suggestions 1-3 - they're in the faq, discussed to
bits on the list, and probably in the wiki as well.
I can only hope that I'm reading suggestion 4 wrongly.
It -sounds- like you're saying:
 	"Log all of the traffic going out of tor exit nodes, and give
 	it to your (local) authorities"
Barring the fact that the NSA[0] are doing a fine job of this sort of thing
already, what on -earth- are you thinking this can do, outside of leaving
you personally liable for all of the traffic exiting your node, -and-
charges of information and identity theft, not to mention ensuring that
a metric ton of tor users are profoundly unhappy with you.
I just realized.
Maybe you're trying to get people to stop using tor...
For Suggestion 5, I suggest that you read more about game theory.
Suggestion 6 makes it much easier to do timing and correlation attacks,
and seems rather dubious as such.
You might want to read the spec -before- commenting, then.
Actually, that holds for your suggestion 7 as well.
... and suggestion 8 - along with some of the research in the field.
Perhaps what you want isn't quite what tor was designed to solve.
[0] and the Stasi before them...

@_subject: Choose exitnodes in country x 
Hi Wesley -
I'm going to presume that your email isn't advertising a commercial service,
which I'd certainly find to be in dubious taste, both from the standpoint
of inappropriate advertising, and from the moral standpoint of profiting
from the goodwill of others.
However - could you say a word-or-five about the privacy and anonymity
implications of connecting directly to your well known site, and then
asking for a specific exit node?
It seems to me that you're not only encouraging people to make highly
identifiable connections to a single location (stunnel or OpenVPN to your
servers), which would then be an excellent target for compromising
anonymity - but you're also then encouraging people to reduce their
anonymity by selecting extremely specific exit nodes, making it again,
easier to identify and target them.
I note that you're saying that Vidalia and Privoxy won't be required - is
your plan to run all of the user traffic through your server, and then
through the Tor network?
A comment on the implications of using a caching web proxy for Tor
users on your server would be interesting as well.

Unfortunately the perms on those are wrong...  could you fix that ;>

@_subject: Cisco firewall filtering Tor? 
I'm curious - why do you think it's a Cisco firewall?
Well - the dump you posted shows that your connection is NATted - are
you using a VPN connection of some sort?
I'm also seeing that the tcp handshake to the selected Tor router works - but after that, you're sending off into space, and the connection is eventually terminated (on your side).
I presume that you're using the latest bundle for OSX?
