@_subject: [tor-talk] Translocating TOR to Freifunk 
What if TOR would be translocated to a dense multi node Freifunk, where
every node could be exit node?
The TOR language would stay inside the Freifunk and the requests that go
through the ISP and reach the net would be non- TOR specific and only
allowing https.

Hi *,
that maybe a bit constructive:
The Gnunet approach of onion routing without directory servers can be
found here:
Maybe there is some cooperation between TOR and Gnunet possible?
Couldn't there be a task done for GSOC this year?
Kind regards

Anonymisation behind them via ?.

@_subject: [tor-talk] A little more hostility towards Tor from Twitter 
You find the qualities of Diaspora under Social Networking within the
group FSW (Federated Social Web projects) compared to:
PRISM = Faceboogle = Most web-based social network services including
Facebook, Google+ etc; Jab = XMPP-based open source federation projects
such as BuddyCloud, movim; SVPN = SocialVPN, an XMPP-based tool that
establishes virtual private networks among friends; FSW = Federated
Social Web projects like Diaspora, Friendica and several more; S at T =
isolated server-based installations operated in trustworthy manner using
a Tor hidden service; RS = RetroShare; RS at T = RetroShare over Tor; NW =
Nightweb over I2P. S = stands for Secure Share's current status.
by the way a current alternative to twitter is twister:

@_subject: [tor-talk] hardware recommendations 
Dear all,
The GNU people would like to make some hardware and software
recommendations to circumvent the FCC Hardware Lock-down which
potentially threatens Open Wireless Communities especially.
Help us completing this table of Libre hardware boards!
Those you care for privacy can help too.
Libre Hardware Yeah!:)
