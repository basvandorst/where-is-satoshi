@_subject: [tor-talk] Could not bind to 0.0.0.0:443: Permission denied 
Few weeks ago I built a Tor network into my WAN lab environment and I'm
using Tor version v0.2.3.17-beta. Today I wanted to change nodes DirPorts
to use 80 and OrPorts to use 443 (before they were between 5000-6000) but I
had the following output when I tried to start my directory server and It
was same thing with the other nodes:
[notice] Opening OR Listener on 0.0.0.0:443
[warn] Could not bind to 0.0.0.0:443: Permission denied
[notice]Opening Directory listener on 0.0.0.0:80
[warn]Could not bind to 0.0.0.0:80: Permission denied
Do I have to somehow run Tor as root or what causes this?
