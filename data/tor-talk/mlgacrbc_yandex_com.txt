@_subject: [tor-talk] YouTube Unscripted 
I've been wanting something like this, as I have to manually rewrite a
lot of YouTube URLs to get them to play as HTML5.  The problem for me is
this solution requires installing the GreaseMonkey extension, and to me
that feels like too much new code to trust: more code => larger attack
surface.  Ideal to me would be an independent extension that minimally
implements this.  Or is my concern about GreaseMonkey unfounded?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Signing up for checking account over Tor 
Recently I began trying to use Tor for all my everyday browsing.  This is a rant about my recent experience trying to signing up for a bank account.  Not sure there is a point other than to vent.  If this is not an appropriate place, sorry.
Last week I applied for a checking account with BB&T (a large regional bank in the US) on bbt.com.  They ask for identity verification, of course, like social security number and driver's license so there is no way to be anonymous about it.  But using Tor, I thought I will get location privacy while using their website.  (They wouldn't be able to know where I physically am using a computer to access their site.)  All went smoothly, my account was approved, I was given an account number and online banking access, and received an e-mail saying:
  We're pleased to inform you that your new BB&T account has been opened. You'll
  receive your welcome package by mail within 7-10 business days.
Today, I blithely go to the local branch to deposit some cash, but the teller says sorry, that my account was closed and that I would have to apply again in person.  Confused, and not having the necessary identification documents, I went back home and tried logging in to online banking, which had previously worked, and now my password is supposedly incorrect.  So I call BB&T customer service.  (At this point I did not suspect Tor had anything to do with the problem, because I was able to use BB&T online banking fine before.)  The customer service agent tells me that the fraud and liability department had closed my account on December 30, and asked if I had been traveling or used someone else's computer when I signed up for an account.  She explains that it happened because I had applied for an account from a computer in a location that did not match my address.  Obviously, Tor was the cause.
So, fuck BB&T for closing my account without notifying me in any way, and fuck BB&T for not allowing me location privacy when signing up for an account on their website.  Sorry to say that I am sticking with them because I don't want to give my personal information to yet another bank, but you all should know that they suck.

If you check multiple e-mail accounts simultaneously with TorBirdy,
would that make it easy for an adversary to correlate the accounts?
My concern is that I have several accounts that are identifying and a
few that are intended to be anonymous (e.g., this one).  If I check all
the accounts at once, it seems an eavesdropper could match the
identifying accounts to the anonymous ones.  I suspect this is a more
general question since the same problem exists with, for example, web

@_subject: [tor-talk] Businesses blocking Tor access 
Add eBay ( to the list of businesses blocking Tor
(whether intentionally or not).  The connection and presumably
unauthenticated browsing aren't disallowed, but login is.  Upon
successful username/password entry, you are told your computer is not
recognized and are prompted to enter a code received via phone or SMS.
Even if you do that, you are immediately returned to the login page with
username and password fields blank.  AFAICT, you cannot turn off the
mobile authentication step.

Sebastian G. :
The adversary I had in mind was a malicious exit node administrator.  If
all e-mail accounts are accessed using the same circuit, it seems the
exit node would see the near simultaneous connections (assume encrypted)
to various e-mail servers, and even with one occurrence suspicion could
be developed that the accounts accessed are linked.
Suppose I check simultaneously:
- john.doe at yandex.com
- jane.doe at gmail.com
- my.actual.name at my.server.org
If the adversary wants to create a database linking many e-mail accounts
accessed over Tor using secure connections, they could collect
simultaneous e-mail account accesses from their exit node.  When the
combination of the servers accessed simultaneously is distinct (e.g.
yandex.com + gmail.com + my.server.org), the accounts can be linked,
even if their account names are unknown.  (The actual account names
could be found out retrospectively, for example by subpoena of gmail.com
accounts accessed at a certain time.)
Unless this threat is flawed, it seems like it therefore would be safest
if TorBirdy used a separate circuit for each account, or enforced delays
between checks of multiple accounts.  (Maybe it already does?)

Mix+TB Test:
Yes, but with cooperation between the e-mail provider(s) and the
malicious exit node, pseudonymous accounts can be connected to accounts
using a real identity.  For example, if the NSA runs a malicious exit
node and wants to know the identity of jane.doe at gmail.com, they can take
from Google all the access times for that account.  Then they can look
at the logs of their exit node, and find possible accesses to that
account, and link them to other e-mail provider accesses.  If one of
these providers is say a personal e-mail server at a domain with valid
WHOIS, jane.doe at gmail.com is deanonymized.
I see your point that an malicious exit node cannot itself deanonymize
by connecting accounts (unless the e-mail providers themselves would
deanonymize the user, which is possible).  So the attack is a little
harder than I initially thought.  There seems to be no technological
impediment to an e-mail provider and a malicious exit node cooperating,

K. Raven:
Thanks, I did not know about IsolateDestAddr.  Is TorBirdy using it?  As
best I can tell it does not when used with a default TBB configuration.
 Maybe it should be a TorBirdy default?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Risk of selectively enabling JavaScript 
TBB enables JavaScript by default, presumably because many websites need
JavaScript.  NoScript can be used to selectively allow JavaScript from
certain domains, but doing so could make it possible to fingerprint your
Tor use.
By my judgment, you are more likely to be deanonymized by a Firefox
JavaScript vulnerability than fingerprinting due to selective JavaScript
allowance, so it is more secure to use NoScript to selectively allow
JavaScript.  I am curious whether others agree with this assessment?  We
know that Firefox vulnerabilities have been used to deanonymize Tor
users, but we have never seen a fingerprinting attack used, AFAIK.
(I am not questioning the TBB default of allowing JavaScript; that
probably should be the default even if it increases risk, for usability

Luther Blissett:
Appreciate your reply.  A couple days later, I realize the above post
was overreacting to a mild inconvenience and I should have expected such
trouble when using Tor, especially for a banking website that may have
received some abuse via Tor.  I complained much more politely via BB&T's
complaint line, and maybe it can be an opportunity to make someone aware
that well-meaning, privacy-concerned people use Tor too, not just bad
guys.  (I am being overly optimistic, probably.)
