@_subject: [tor-talk] [rt.torproject.org #7406] Proxify app 
Hello everybody !
I was talking with Moritz Barti about a project ( I'm on, and the way to get the random port used by vidalia.
He told me about the "Control Port", which I didn't understand yet but I will focus on it as soon as I'm free.
If you want to talk about it, if you want to comment my app, if you need idea about how could the "API" part of Vidalia be improved? I can give ideas.
Good day everybody !
