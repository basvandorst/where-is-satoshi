@_subject: [tor-talk] Presentation material in LaTeX 
Hash: SHA1
We (jvoisin [1] and me) recently made a presentation about TOR for our
school (the UTBM, a french engineering school).
There were almost 50 people, and the feedbacks are very positive.
The presentation was made with LaTeX and tears, and even if you don't
speak french, you can find the slides here [2] and the source here [3].
Feel free to borrow whatever you want from it !
