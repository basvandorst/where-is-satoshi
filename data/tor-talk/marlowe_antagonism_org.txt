@_subject: Build from tor-0.1.1.25 SRPM for CentOS 4.4 x86_64 fails 
Hash: SHA1
I made the change suggested above and reattempted the build.  I received
the following error instead,
checking build system type... Invalid configuration
`athlon64-pc-linux-gnu': machine `athlon64-pc' not recognized
I downloaded the regular source and attempted a compile just to ensure I
wasn't missing anything on my system which would prevent the configure
statement from completing.  A ./configure ran without any problems.
However I did not use all the options in the tor.spec.  I will be
attempting those next one by one until I find which values are the
correct ones.

Hash: SHA1
I am attempting to build tor from the source RPM on a AMD64 processor.
When I run the following command,
# rpmbuild -ba tor.spec
I receive the following error,
checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C
compiler cannot create executables
See `config.log' for more details.
error: Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.38507 (%build)
RPM build errors:
    Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.38507 (%build)
Below is the config.log output
This file contains any messages produced by compilers while
running configure, to aid debugging if configure makes a mistake.
It was created by configure, which was
generated by GNU Autoconf 2.59.  Invocation command line was
  $ ./configure --build=i386-pc-linux-gnu --host=i386-pc-linux-gnu

@_subject: ORPort is unreachable from the Internet 
When attempting to run Tor as a middleman server (middleman exit policy
and SocksPort 0), I consistently receive the following error message
Oct 07 09:26:39.096 [warn] second_elapsed_callback(): Your server
(68.101.42.157:9001) has not managed to confirm that its ORPort is
reachable. Please check your firewalls, ports, address, /etc/hosts file,
I am running Tor 0.1.1.24 installed from RPM on a CentOS 4.3 machine
behind a Linksys access point with the server as the DMZ host with all
traffic forwarded to it.  The Tor recognizes my DirPort (9030)
immediately, but never the ORPort (9001).  Both ports are allowed
inbound through the firewall and I have validated connection from other
Tor nodes with "netstat -an".  I can connect to the ORPort on the local
machine with the following command:
# torify telnet 68.101.42.157 9001
What else should I check to determine why my node is failing the ORPort
reachability test?

@_subject: Culled Wedged CPUworkers Bug 
I have discovered the following error message in my log files:
"[notice] cull_wedged_cpuworkers(): Bug: closing wedged cpuworker. Can somebody find the bug?"
Has anyone else seen this and if so what information can I provide to help track down this bug?

@_subject: Culled Wedged CPUworkers Bug 
I have installed 0.1.1.24 on CentOS 4.2 with full updates.  The CPU on the machine is on the lower end (1 GHz).  As previously noted on this list, I was having trouble getting my ORPort to be recognized as reachable until I compiled Tor with --disable-threads.  The threads problem disappeared with an upgrade to the CentOS kernel RPM, The error appears over the last couple of days in the log at 1000 and 2200 EST each day.  I am not able to induce the error myself.  What other information (i.e. debug logs, etc) can I provide to help debug this issue?

@_subject: [ANNOUNCE] Incognito CD r142 released 
Pat, thanks very much.  This should solve the USB problem I experienced
with the previous version making a USB.  It is as if you read my mind.
No problem.  Is there anything we can to help?
