@_subject: directory server 
Seems to me, the more authoritative directory servers run, the more robust
the network is.  I'd like to do this.  Perhaps some of our existing
directory server administrators can push me in the correct direction?
Very best,

@_subject: exit policy 
I would like to set an exit policy, but at the same time, I would like to be safe.  I want my cake and eat it too.  Is there a suggested safe exit policy?  As far as websites go, what is preferred is the ability to read websites, but not write, such as would be done on hotmail.  Secured protocols are preferred also, so there is end to end encryption.
Any suggestions?
