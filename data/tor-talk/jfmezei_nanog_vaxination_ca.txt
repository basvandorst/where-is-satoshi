@_subject: [tor-talk] William was raided for running a Tor exit node. 
The BBC has an article about a similar issue on a Tor exit node in Austria:
Austrian police raid privacy network over child porn
Austrian police have seized servers that were part of a global anonymous
browsing system, after images showing child sex abuse were found passing
through them.
Many people use the Tor network to conceal their browsing activity.
Police raided the home of William Weber, who ran the servers, and
charged him with distributing illegal images.
It is unfortunate that systems in place to allow free speech end up
being abused for the wrong purposes. The same applies to anonymous
remailers which have been used to stalk and harass/bully people often
using forged email addresses (since those remailers allow one to forge
the sender's email address instead of forcing an "Anonymous" sender email.
If Tor servers are just glorified routers then they could be considered
more as transit providers and not responsible for content transiting
through them.
However, if a transit service goes out of its way to hide the identity
of the sender of a packet to make it untraceable, then it becomes more
than a simpler "carrier".
