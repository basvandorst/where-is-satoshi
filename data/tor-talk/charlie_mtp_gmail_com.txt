Hi !  I read all the documentation I found and I can't find anything
about to obtain new ID (IP). I see how vidalia can get new ID
everytime they want, I guess the software are sending some signal to
the TOR.exe. Can you help me guys to know what command o what I need
to do that ?
Thanks, best regards,
Carlos M. Trepeu
