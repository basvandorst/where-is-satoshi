@_subject: [tor-talk] misleading advice in Ars Technica article about patched 
Hello Tor friends:
AN article on Ars Technica about the malicious exit nodes contains some
misleading advice attributed to "Tor officials."
a VPN when using the privacy service, and OnionDuke provides a strong
cautionary tale when users fail to heed that advice."
Maybe the article was supposed to read "HTTPS" instead of "VPN". Or,
"verify binaries" instead of "employ a VPN."
Could a real "Tor official" contact the author and ask for a correction?
Thank you.
