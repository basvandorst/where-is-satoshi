@_subject: No Tor server exists that allows exit to [scrubbed]:80. Rejecting. 
I'm getting the following log entries in my tor server log:
Aug 23 12:52:28.996 [notice] No Tor server exists that allows exit to [scrubbed]:80. Rejecting.
Aug 23 12:52:28.996 [warn] directory_initiate_command(): Making AP bridge to dirserver failed.

I'm running with reject *:* on my server.
On my tor client (Which uses my server as entry node) running with
privoxy, I get "domain name xyz could not be resolved." for every page
I try to access with tor/privoxy.
The client debug log says:

Does anyone know where that comes from? I never saw such behavior before...

I'm now also getting:

I didn't change anything on the configuration AFAIR.

Hello everyone,
the TOR server koehntopp[1] is down at the moment. The hosting
provider Strato disabled the server. The reasons for the block are
unknown at the moment. The hotline is not available on weekends, so
reactivation is possible on monday at the earliest.

@_subject: DNS Resolving Errors 
I'm seeing increasing problems with DNS resolving over TOR. In the
last few weeks I got "host not found" errors very often while surfing
a website. After a few times hitting reload the page resolves and
loads, but after following a link the problem often occurs again on
the next page.
I'm using socks4a(privoxy) so DNS is routed through TOR.
Has anyone else seen this problem and perhaps a solution for it?

Well some people say that Germans like to follow orders. I really hope
that our providers tell GEMA to fck'off. Right now it seems that noone
is doing anything. On the other side we already have some cases where
providers were forced by a court to block sites. The method (faking
DNS records) isn't really effective but enough for the average user.
Anyway I'm happy that TOR is working.

Yeah, I would prefer that, too. I didn't realise that you don't link
to the mirrors anymore. I thought your script would redirect people to
mirrors. The way it works now makes mirroring torpark useless IMHO.

Hi again,
on my new tor server ip I want to host a website which just explains
what the server does and why I can't provide any logs etc. Is there
already some sort of explanation in a few languages say
germany/english/french or something? I can write a site in german but
my english is really far away from perfect and I would like everyone
to understand what that tor-anonproxy.karotte.org is and what it does.

Great text! For a start I have a little enhancement:
You are probably visiting this web site because you saw this host name
in your log files. This server is part of a volunteer-supported
distributed network of servers running a program called Tor. Tor is used
to anonymize web browsing and publishing, instant messaging, IRC, SSH,
and other applications using the TCP protocol. Tor aims to provide
internet users with protection against "traffic analysis," a form of
network surveillance that threatens personal anonymity and privacy,
confidential business activities and relationships, freedom of speech
and state security.
If you are investigating abuse that you believe passed through this IP
address, you should know that it probably did not originate from this
server and the operator of this server has no effective means of tracing
the origins of the encrypted traffic that has passed through this server.
Tor server operators regret that some users may behave abusively, but we
also feel that providing a resource that improves anonymity and privacy
is important. See the Abuse FAQ at for more information.
You can learn more about Tor at its website: I added freedom of speech to the things tor protects and removed the
mentionend .en from the URL.

@_subject: Traffic Characteristics? 
at the moment I'm seeing twice as much outgoing traffic from TOR then
incoming traffic, where does that come from, is that normal behavior?
As far as I understand it, it should be mostly 1:1 because I'm just
forwarding the traffic.
(IP18 is my TOR IP, EXT is the internet, traffic for the last hour)
# Src Tag   Dst Tag     flows                 octets                packets

No, surely not, tor was running fine here for months. :)
