@_subject: [tor-talk] suggestion/fix for the signing keys 
The signing keys are listed on
 but the keys
themselves are hosted on the MIT keyserver. However they've been
notoriously unreliable for me in the past - time outs and proxy errors,
with and without TOR browser. During the last 3 days I tried over a dozen
times to get one of the keys again, even with changing identities multiple
times it never worked.
Could the Tor team please, please provide a more reliable method to
retrieve their keys? Too few people already use the PGP keys for
verifying, let's not scare off the ones that actually want to.
