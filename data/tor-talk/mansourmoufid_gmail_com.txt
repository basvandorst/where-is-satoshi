More information:
Sounds to me like a cryptographic attack (among others) -- the virus
modifies the crypto upstream and there is an observable effect
downstream. Could holding a CTR nonce constant in RAM (combined with
plaintext injection) have a ripple effect in the Tor network?

This may be 'key'. From the latest article mentioned: [1]
? Cela nous permet de fixer les cl?s de chiffrement et les lecteurs
d?initialisation des algorithmes de cryptographie et, ainsi, d?annuler
deux couches de chiffrement sur les trois ?, poursuit Eric Filiol.
So the virus holds both key and IV/nonce constant in RAM.
This sounds a lot like [2] (beginning slide 33), and also like [3]
where Windows malware weakens VPN encryption keys from 256- to 40-bit.
This isn't an attack on Tor but on the Tor *network*, with a few
different attacks used together (a la Stuxnet). All very interesting.

Also keep in mind that [1] claims 30% -- of the 50% of routers which
run Windows -- may be vulnerable. So, 15% of routers (assuming these
estimates are correct) in total, probably corresponding to a tiny
fraction of the network's net capacity, considering these nodes are
likely home users on DSL.
A better translation is: "The remaining flows can then be completely
decrypted by an unknown-plaintext [ciphertext-only] attack, based on
statistical analysis."
I've never heard of such an attack against post-WWII ciphers. (Except
perhaps the 1974 version of crypt -- see [2] for an interesting read

Does anyone know if this is caused by any one country or group of
countries in particular? (Perhaps corresponding to the Dutch theorem
of a previous thread?)
Is this is an automated phenomenon or a human one?
Human traffic has a distinct signature: usage peaks on weekends. You
can see it clearly in the graphs. Quantified with a power spectrum:
see 1.png attached. Notice the big peak at a frequency of about 1.6e-6
Hz, which corresponds to a periodicity of one week.
That's data for usage from Iran from the beginning of this year until
last week. The same is true for other countries, but one cannot do
this analysis on the global aggregate data because it loses a lot of
signal to noise due to time zone differences, unfortunately. Although,
there are (tedious) ways to fix that...
So, in a few weeks there will be data to test this hypothesis...
I would love to also see data from that "get bridges via email" system
(# of requests per day, by country), if it's not already available. If
privacy is an issue, adding in Gaussian noise shouldn't harm this kind
of analysis.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and resumed TLS handshakes 
Hello list,
I'm reading about TLS, and just read more about the "resumed TLS
handshake" shortcut.
Apparently the "session ID"/"resume" value in ServerHello/ClientHello
can be a privacy concern. [1] I think it might also conflicts with the
goals of Tor, so I was curious if Torbutton was blocking it. This is
what I tried, to check Torbutton, on a Ubuntu LiveCD:
Install Tor, polipo, check it works, etc. Then stop Tor and instead
set up a local SOCKS proxy with SSH:
ubuntu at ubuntu:~$ sudo service tor stop
ubuntu at ubuntu:~$ ssh -D 9050 ubuntu at localhost
(Leaving polipo as-is.)
Install ssldump. Start Firefox with Torbutton toggled. Go to some
HTTPS-enabled site, like Twitter, but first start ssldump. ssldump
prints the "session ID" field first sent by the server:
ubuntu at ubuntu:~$ sudo ssldump -d -i eth0 | grep -A4 ServerHello
      ServerHello
        Version 3.1
        session_id[32]=
          69 46 56 83 f5 06 88 20 85 56 96 1a 6f 91 31 74
          51 85 11 85 10 e5 6f 5b 43 07 0c 27 83 8c f8 a4
Use Twitter some more... ssldump shows the browser parroting the same
number back:
ubuntu at ubuntu:~$ sudo ssldump -d -i eth0 | grep -A4 ClientHello
      ClientHello
        Version 3.1
        resume [32]=
          69 46 56 83 f5 06 88 20 85 56 96 1a 6f 91 31 74
          51 85 11 85 10 e5 6f 5b 43 07 0c 27 83 8c f8 a4
Seems like a nice way for Google Analytics or others to track users
across exit nodes... Is this likely? Did I miss something?

I believe the logic is that parties concerned about package integrity
would be equally concerned with running someone else's pre-compiled
binaries in the first place, and so would just use Portsnap.
Speaking of which (off topic)... Tor should keep up with signed tags
in its git repos. Obfsproxy.git isn't tagged at all; tor.git is only
up to 0.2.3.9-alpha.
Also, shouldn't [1] recommend `git clone git://' over `
since if one needs obfsproxy, HTTPS likely isn't very discreet.

I do think proxying through a single daemon is best. But there could
also be a simple, graphical equivalent of "torify". Perhaps a Torify
icon on the desktop that you drag and drop application icons on. Or a
right-click "Launch with Tor" option.
But statically linked torX applications for all X would quickly become a
packaging nightmare.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Leave Your Cellphone at Home 
Very interesting read.
I'm not sure I buy the theories for the new data centre. Drive capacity
has increased on the same order of magnitude as Internet traffic, [1,2]
so I doubt the increase in traffic from current targets is the reason
for it. I also doubt extending the surveilled set by 5% to include the
US is the reason.
Besides, according to the whistleblowers, everything that's attributed
to it has been going on for a long time. Unless there's concrete evidence
I haven't heard of, I tend to believe it actually is for "cybersecurity",
specifically the insider threat. These agencies monitor their own people
(and soon-to-be corporate partners) far more than the public.
On that note, apparently there's half a dozen versions of HR 3523 around,
and NSA versus DHS (aka "the happy face") is an artificial distinction,
meant to appease. [3]
Anyway, I think cryptography will depend more and more on steganography

Why don't they do all that now? Tor is free software. Because they can't
be bothered to read the code. Which means they're likely to misuse a
libtor anyway.
And including dependencies in software you distribute is bad practice.
"Anonymity" depends on the entire stack from the transport to the
application. IMHO, putting a Tor sticker on everything will distract
from that fact.

It might be better for the botnet operator to keep playing cat and mouse

With regards to the Tor network in general, what is "the game"? If some
censor naively blocks Tor, people flock to bridge nodes, which are much
harder to block. If Ethiopia can block Tor, then perhaps others like
Iran also know how -- but don't? Who knows...

and other traffic their DPI can't identify, is steadily throttled down

Iran must be doing this with Canadian tech -- it sounds so familiar.

@_subject: [tor-talk] advice to hidden service operators 
Hi everyone,
I'd like to share some advice to operators of hidden services in order
to mitigate the attack family known as "traffic confirmation" attacks.
(I say mitigate because the early implementation of these attacks
are likely trivial enough to be defended against, for now, but will
get much better quickly.)
First, rate-limit traffic to individual clients at the firewall level
to some human number (eg a couple new connections per minute).  This
is a common protection against denial-of-service attacks, but in this
case should be set just high enough to be tolerable to users.
Second, HTTP servers should be configured to log access times and
requests, or time and request size if possible (and nothing else).
These logs should be remote.  This will help you understand an attack
better after the fact.
Finally, some low, constant background traffic will frustrate the
least competent attackers.
Good luck.

In case you missed it:
"On Effectiveness of Hopping-Based Spread Spectrum Techniques for

They implemented new traffic confirmation attacks that cannot be
detected by the end points, based on some radar techniques.  They
don't mention it but the attacks can be implemented in real time.
They can also decrease the false positive rate by increasing the
bandwidth of the DSSS chip.  A patient enough attacker can have no
false positives.

Outsourcing through the Tor network would make it possible in real time.

The audience of the Tor project, ever since it's provided a convenient
browser rather than just source code, is the average user, not the
technical community.  So when the Tor project website promises
"anonymity," they are not using the technical definition.
If it were just about which words to use, the term "unlinkability"
has been proposed before.  But words aren't the problem.
Here's another term in the advertising material that has a specific
technical definition: traffic analysis.  Tor is advertised as a
protecting against traffic analysis (by governments a.k.a. global
adversaries) which it does not and couldn't possibly do.
The advertising doesn't correspond to reality, because it's false
and dishonest, not because the user is dumb.
