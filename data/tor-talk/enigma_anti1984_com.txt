@_subject: Media campaign against connection data storage 
Hash: SHA1
Hi all,
The /Arbeitskreis Vorratsdatenspeicherung/ (German association against
the connection data storage directive) is setting up a campaign
against the connection data storage by calling for a web demonstration
as well as contacting the mass media to report about this EU
directive. Again it's only for German citizens and German webmasters
but since members of this mailing list said it's interesting to read
about these developments nevertheless I thought I'd notify everyone
about this campaign.
The English article can be found here:
The German article is located at:
Speaking of German webmasters, I really wonder if not every European
webmaster should be able to participate in that and have a javascript
showing the same thing in English language? After all, all European
webmasters and citizens will be affected.
What do you think?
(I know this mailing list is mainly about Tor, so if a discussion
about this is not welcomed here let us know and we can start one in
anti1984's forum
at  )

I know what a gateway is when thinking of my home router. But what is
a Tor gateway? First I thought you were talking about exit nodes but
apparently you refer to something different. As far as I know, there
are only Tor nodes; middleman and exit nodes, did I miss anything in

Hi all,
I know, this topic will not be interesting to everyone but there are
German users in this mailing list after all and I considered this to
be important enough to let them know about it in case they haven't
heard of this yet. The "Arbeitskreis Vorratsdatenspeicherung"
(association against connection data storage) appeals for a
class-action lawsuit (Sammelklage) at the Bundesverfassungsgericht
(German federal constitutional court) against the planned connection
data storage. They offer a form that needs to be filled out , printed
and sent to a specific lawyer in Berlin. That document authorizes him
to take over the case at court for you, it's free of charge and you
don't have to show up in person either. More about that topic can be
read here (German article):
Sorry, there's no English article for that so far since I wonder if
it's interesting enough for non Germans? Feedback on this is welcomed. ;)

Hash: SHA1
Well it's a while since I disabled the Dirport but yes, when it was
enabled it consumed a lot of bandwidth and browsing was slow.
Disabling Dirport should make a significant difference. After all,
you're mirroring the entire Tor server network information from what I
know and a lot of nodes request that information from time to time.
Personally, I'd only enable Dirport again on dedicated servers that
have a high bandwidth.

I have the same problem each time I start my home server (Windows XP

the last line ends like yours: .. is back up. So I believe since it ends

Thanks a lot, Tim! I really should have searched the entire Tor

About IE: it's not safe to use it at ALL. ;) But just like George
mentioned, this fact doesn't make the majority switch to alternate
browsers yet so I figured I'd support Firefox and IE (yeah I know
there is Opera and such but since I don't use them I can't write about
them). Adding a note about the safety of using IE with Tor is a good
suggestion, I'll add that, too.

Hash: SHA1
I can't give you a technical answer to that but rest assured you would
not like the result if all worked the way you want it to be. That's
because using P2P with anonymous networks such as Tor will be much too
slow, it will heavily decrease your P2P performance. I recommend using
some anonymous network that is specifically designed for P2P, I2P is
one of them. However, it might take years until most private
connections have enough bandwidth to ensure fast and
anonymous/encrypted P2P (and only if enough people dedicate their
bandwidth to these networks). But as said, you would want to prefer a
network that is intended for P2P usage.

Hash: SHA1
Hi all, this is very concerning in my opinion:
The German minister of the interior is crazy saying online
surveillance should not be limited by any areas of our privacy as well
as he considers using trojans against citizens! I wonder what the next
step will be, founding the mind police? Since Switzerland discussed
the usage of "federal trojans" too I wouldn't be surprised if this
discussion will start in other countries too. Even Tor may become
useless then for the average user. As a German, I find this behavior
very ashaming.
P.S.: if you'd like to discuss this I invite you to the anti1984.com
forum since this mailing list is meant for Tor. Nevertheless I think
people will be interested in these news (I hope).

I selected a new subject line since this isn't on topic anymore
(letter from the feds). I noticed in the German version the help text
is not completely displayed so the user doesn't know what that limit
is really about (and the help icon is talking about the old limit, the
INcoming traffic limit only).
So I switched to English and it tells me to put in my upload speed. So
I tried out 40 kb/s maximum and 20 kb/s minimum and get the following
error message each time I start my (middleman) server:
Jan 12 16:54:38:703 [Warning] bandwidthrate unreadable or 0. Failing.
Jan 12 16:54:38:703 [Warning] router_rebuild_descriptor(): Couldn't

Jan 12 16:54:40:203 [Warning] router_rebuild_descriptor(): Couldn't

It goes on and on like that. I looked at the torrc file and it
correctly saved what I typed in:
BandwidthBurst 40960
# A token bucket limits the average incoming bandwidth on this node to the
# specified number of bytes per second.
BandwidthRate 20480
If I put in 3 digit numbers (for example 300 kb/s and 200 kb/s) I
don't get the error message. However, my bandwidth is completey taken
by Tor and denies any other internet activities unless I had all the
time of the world available. ;)

@_subject: Bandwidth limit and version display bug? 
Hash: SHA1
I'm using the latest Tor version (0.1.2.6) on Windows XP. However, it
displays 0.1.2.5 in the log (I just installed the 0.1.2.6 package
again and same error).
Also, I think I found the error for the following log messages:
Jan 20 19:59:56:750 [Warning] bandwidthrate unreadable or 0. Failing.
Jan 20 19:59:56:765 [Warning] router_rebuild_descriptor(): Couldn't
allocate string for descriptor.
I put in a custom bandwidth limit in Vidalia (48 kb/s maximum, 25 kb/s
average) and Vidalia adds the following entry into the config file
(both torrc and vidalia.conf):
As you can see, the BandwidthBurst number is a totally different one
and apparently Tor can't read it (as the log claims). If I change the
numbers in the config files manually I don't get the error message
anymore. Maybe Vidalia saves certain bandwidth limit numbers wrong in
the config file?

@_subject: tor and p2p 
Hash: SHA1
Personally, I believe you won't see any useful/fast anonymous p2p
network until most users have very fast broadband connections with
high upstream (something that isn't very common in my country for
example) due to the huge amount of data that has to be forwarded or it
would be awfully slow. While broadband is catching up in many
countries to a point where it's really fast quite networks need to be
created or adapted (as you wrote). So as long as development time is
not lacking behind broadband development it's probably all on the
right track. However, I believe it will take many years still till we
are at a point where most users have the bandwidth to ensure a fast,
anonymous network. Take the edonkey network as an example. If everyone
contributes just 10-20 kb/s it might be too slow unless the file isn't
too large or you have a huge amount of uploaders. So if that is too
slow, it would take even more upstream bandwidth to send the data AND
the encryption related data / the forwarded traffic of other users as
well as your own).
Look at VoIP for example, it's just the opposite: encryption programs
such as zfone are available, so is the bandwidth in many countries.
However, hardware development is lacking behind (okay, zfone is rather
new still) and it will still take a good while until you can initiate
encrypted voip conversations with hardware phones (hopefully earlier
than later).
I remember some people came up with the idea of creating VPNs so each
user gets a different IP instead of using his own. I'm not very
experienced in VPNs but I believe that requires a VPN host/service
that guarantees to not forward the connection data to anyone and/or
doesn't log any connection data.
When looking at available anonymity services it appears as if we will
have to use different networks in the future for different purposes
because each of them seems to specialize on something. Freenet for
example seems to be perfect for storing web content anonymously (blogs
etc), I2P (never tried this yet) for p2p and Tor for browsing, IRC
etc. But who knows, maybe one of these networks will become one
network for everything someday instead. ;)

Hash: SHA1
Yeah, Stephen, you should check the log. In case you're running Tor on
a non server Windows version Tor might have shut down due to that
nasty WSAENOBUFS error. Once that happens your Tor server might be
listed as offline a bit later. Sadly, this bug is still around and
probably can't be fixed easily since it may not be a bug caused by Tor
(?). In case you want to know more about it look up this link:
Not saying this happened to you (maybe you aren't even using XP) but
things like that can make your server list as offline. In any case,
after the Tor server was started it takes a good while before it is
listed at all in the server lists.

- From what it sounds your destinations are normal phones. In that case
your calls will not be encrypted. Actually, Tor could encrypt your
call up to the point where it arrives at a gateway that connects to
the public phone network. From there it can no longer be encrypted
since there's no way to handle the encrypted data in a public phone
network (yes there are exceptions but that's rare and a different
topic). In summary: you can't make fully encrypted calls to a non-VOIP
phone from what I know.

Yeah, from what I know, "catching signal TERM, exiting cleanly" just
means Tor is shutting down but will wait (30 secs I think) before
doing so to allow clients to find a new circuit first (hope that was
correct). So it's all working as intended regarding this message. ;)

Hi again,
I can't answer your question directly since I don't use Skype.
However, in general you should set the proxy option in your
application to localhost and the respective port. Just try it out and
see if it works or wait for an answer by someone who is familiar with
Skype. Also, I'm not sure whether voice may be too slow when using Tor.
About VOIP: I did not say VOIP calls are encrypted. ;) I said it is
possible to encrypt them by using zfone. But just like email
encryption it requires both participants to use it. By default, VOIP
calls are *not* encrypted.

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that. Sly16, I read somewhere Skype is
just encrypting its own protocol but not the traffic itself. Not sure
whether it's true or not. In any case Skype users rely on a closed
source protocol so no one really knows if it's secure and what else it
may or may not do. I'm not saying it's insecure but if you want to be
certain your connections are encrypted you might want to consider
using other tools or techniques for voice communication that support
open source encryption. As for voice my first idea would be VOIP and
zfone. For text based communications (IRC or something) I'd rely on Tor.
