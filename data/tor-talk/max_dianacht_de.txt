my Max is about 1GB/day. So my server i going hibernating after half a
day and gets a reset every day.
mrtg ist not very sensitive to counter resets, maybe you will loose the
traffic of 5 minutes, but that's all.
I use a script in /usr/local/mrtg/tor
 echo -en "authenticate\r\ngetinfo accounting/bytes\r\nquit\r\n" | \
      nc localhost 9051 | grep acc|\
      awk '{gsub("250-accounting/bytes=","");print $1; print $2}'
 /usr/bin/uptime | awk '{ gsub(",","");print $3, $4, $5 }'
 echo "dianacht.de"
and in my mrtg.cfg
Target[tor]:   `/usr/local/mrtg/tor`
Title[tor]:    Tor
PageTop[tor]:  Tor Traffic
Options[tor]:  growright, avgpeak
MaxBytes[tor]: 12500000
kilo[tor]:     1024
looks very similar to your solution, my script creates this output:
 (looking like a sawtooth because
of daily hibernating periods)
There is a little gap between the "real" traffic generated by tor and
the measured traffic (about 5-10% more "real" traffic). I think because
accounting does not count the TLS overhead. This is fixed in
0.1.2.5-alpha, as I read...

my non-exit node ran on a vServer with ulimit 1024. Because I was afraid
of running in this limit I logged the number of oben files with
   pid=`cat /home/tor/.tor/tor.pid`
   sock=`ls -x1 /proc/$pid/fd | wc -l`
The number of open files depends on the bandwith limit. I don't know,
what my limit was, I think 40kb/s and the number of open sockets was
about 80 or 90.
Perhaps you could start with a low bandwith limit and have a look at
your number of open sockets.

Will we need the stream data? As far as I see in the new ?113a TKG [*] we don't have to log the whole
circuit data. We just have to log, which nodes connect to our node and
which IP-address we give this connection (that's the IP-address of our
own node, so we have to log this only once). The IP-address of the next
node is not required.

Perhaps someone isn't looking for an unknown IP-address, but just want
to prove that the owner if a given IP-address is the owner of the
Mailbox "green lantern at yahoo". If this one is able to do a traffic analysis on this IP-address and
knows the login time at the pop/imap-Server of yahoo, a well defined
pattern of mail sizes could help. But in this case I think it's not useful for him, to send these mails in
such short intervals, because you would fetch both mails at one login
and in one stream of data...
