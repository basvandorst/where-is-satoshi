portaPuTTY is a hacked version of PuTTY that stores all its information in
files, not in the registry. I made this version so I could have a good SSH
client to run from a USB drive.  You may find it useful if you're running
tor off a flash drive.
Other than that, it's the PuTTY you know and love.

I agree that anonymity has positive uses, and you list some good examples,
that's a terrible statement, unless you happen to see art in messing up the
information in wikipedia.
Tor brings up serious issues that can't be easily dismissed with such

Fair enough.
I understand your point: Some may not consider what he does art.  And it's a
good point, as far as it goes.  If folks knew who he was, they could stop
him from doing more; ie he would be spotted walking into the museum.
But I can't think of something like tor making what he does possible.  Maybe
I'm not imaginative enough.  I think that's the key difference here, though:
Banksy does what he does without a bit of technology enabling him.
So I think your point stands in support of anonymity, but not in favor of
allowing abuse through tor.
(I know, there are other arguments about that, but I'm not addressing them
here 8)

Oh boy, this could get very recursive if we're not careful 8)
If you don't know me and I walk in, then, well, you don't now me.  So by
default I'm anonymous.
If I visit your website, and you don't know me, you can see my IP address in
the logs, etc. So by default I'm not anonymous, and I need tor to help.
My point (and I'm certainly willing to concede it may be invalid) is that
tor changes the default, which makes is very different than the inherit
anonymity in the real world.
(And yes, I'm leaving things out like video monitoring for simplicity)
Of course. But does that mean we ignore the ones who do bad things?
Which raises the question: what is bad, anyway? And can we prevent the abuse
without preventing the overall good?
Or to make it concrete: Can we prevent abuse of wikipedia without preventing
people who use tor legitimately (if that's the right term) from being able
to do what they want?
(perhaps that should be "can the abuse of wikipedia be prevented" rather
than "Can we prevent", as I'm not certain it's tor's problem)
if I haven't mentioned it already: I'm not saying tor is useless; I believe
quite the opposite. But we need to be careful and thoughtful in our
arguments.  Not that I'm the one to decide what's careful and thoughtful, by
any means

I don't think "precarious" is the same as "invalid"

@_subject: What happened with the Tor USB Keychain idea? 
I got portable firefox, and installed the regular version of tor (windows)
onto the thumbdrive. Worked fine, as far as I could tell.  I never paid much
attention to what, if anything, tor saved in user settings or whatever.

It's not available, but no reason it couldn't be. Well, other than that it's ugly. I wrote this, made a few tweaks, and left it. Honestly I doubt I would do it this way again.
I am using the maxmind stuff as well, at first. If that fails it tries "Community Geotarget IP Project" at

You're welcome. That's why I went with static images
I used that map for a few reasons:
1. Images don't require javascript, as already noted
2. It's free
3. I thought it looked cool.
I suppose that, if someone who can't locate Florida looked at them map, they would be satisfied to look at the pretty dots.

Two thoughts:
First, we are both apparently using the max mind stuff, but I have a fallback if that fails. That may explain why I have more.
Two: I noticed that certain IPs in some countries always seemed to return a specific city. Specifically here, anything in China said "Beijing." Don't know if that's accurate, or screwed up data, or what. But I don't attempt to verify anything, just slap it on the map.
The map should be active nodes at the time it's run. The other data should be over time. "Should be" because I never put much effort into making sure it was doing things correctly. It was an experiment for me. If there's interest in it again I may examine it a bit more, or perhaps redo it (it's not terribly complicated) to be cleaner and let others poke around in the code and tell me my errors :)
