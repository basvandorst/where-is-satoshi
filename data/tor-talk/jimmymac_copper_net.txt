That would be a pretty big upload for a dial-up user!
I am also wondering what kind of danger you think a *client* can have
for the Tor network.
And if somebody wanted to circumvent, I would think the client could be
modified so that when it claimed to be uploading itself, it was actually
uploading a copy of an unmodified binary.  Am I missing something?
Also what would be gained from a CRC based on the *binary*?  Wouldn't
that change according to the system that compiled it?

@_subject: Version checking (was Re: 25 tbreg relays in directory) 
The problem with your logic (leaving aside the questions of whether it
is desire or doable) is that it is *source* code that gets committed to
the development tree, but you are wanting to authenticate against
*object* code (at least that's what it used to be called), i.e.,
binaries.  If there were a way to authenticate against *source* code
(yeah, right) then your plan might be doable, even if not desirable. But when I compile my code (and I do), the resulting binary is dependent
on the particulars of my system.  I suspect if I compiled it on two
different machines (and I have) I would get two different binaries even
when I start with the same source.
> If the tor application wont get means to authenticate itself's
internals, then im afraid (IMHO) we will be looking at a future with
*many* independent tor networks who are not connected to each others
cloud because of differences...
The need is for the code to be interoperable.  Interoperability is a
much lower threshold than authenticating binaries people run. Presumably your desire to authenticate stems from lack of trust -- i.e.
fear of an attacker.   But attackers are (or can be) clever and I don't
think that even in *prinicple* you can reliably authenticate w/o
requiring things that would destroy anonymity.  That is, before you can
trust me, you have to know who I am (with certainty) and what I am
doing.  If you don't know who I am I can tell you anything I want (such
as what binary I'm running) and you won't know the difference.

Perhaps you meant when /using Tor/ the ISP cannot detect the destination
address or port number?  (I read your email several times and did not
detect this meaning.)  Surely on a generic encrypted connection the ISP
can determine the destination of the connection.  (For a Tor user, that
would be the the IP address of the entry guard.)

I can't speak for all governments but it might be relevant to point out
 that onion routing started (as I understand it -- anybody, feel free to
correct) as a project of the U.S. Navy and was used by the various
branches of the U.S armed forces to use the Internet anonymously.
Trouble was, that although their targets could not tell *exactly* who
was visiting their website, they could tell it was U.S. military.  So,
as I understand it, they released the technology so they could hide
among the civilians.
Even within a particular govt you can have conflicting goals.  Part may
wish to prevent its citizens from being anonymous while another part may
find it useful to use civilians for cover.
Just my speculation ...

Yahoo does not block access.  However you will frequently get an "error 999".  You can get around this by using their CAPTCHA based login.  Do realize that while the login is https, the mail viewing/sending is not.  So malicious exit nodes will be able to view all of the email you view/send.

I have no problems with either of those goals.  Certainly, protecting
the network is a priority.  Protecting "uninformed or unsuspecting"
users gets trickier IMHO.  I'll admit this is a bit of a hot-button
issue for me and I may have overreacted.  But I think care needs to be
taken before cavalierly shutting something down to protect uninformed or
unsuspecting users.  I agree with Ringo <2600denver at gmail.com> when he
wrote (at Tue, 30 Jun 2009 00:06:01 -0400) "Remotely disabling Tor nodes
is a slippery slope."
I was aware of that at the beginning of this discussion.
My point was the users knew that they were installing *some* software. They may not have know that the software contained Tor or even what Tor
is.  But I see the situation as similar to unscrupulous people slipping
malware or other unknown software into packages people willingly
install. While I don't approve of that, neither do I feel compelled to
police it.  Which would be a futile endevour anyway.
Yet the "harm at the hands of that State" has nothing to do (TMK) with
the fact that the clients were insecure, but rather that they were Tor.
Again, maybe I was overreacting. But I do think people who are not
trying to be tyrants nonetheless need to be very careful with "for your
own good" attitudes.  IMO it gets very tricky.
I probably should have canned the sarcasm, but I do think that any
disabling of the client from the network should be easily reversible. Part of that is just my philosophy.  But it also has a practical element
in terms of what is required to resume functionality if the client
suddenly and unexpectedly stop working.  Somebody may not wish to take
the time to install at that moment.
My disagreement is not about what Pei Hanru wrote.  My disagreement is
interpretation.  As I read the post, people knew they were isntalling
software for the purpose of registering multiple accounts.  Perhaps they
did not understand how that software allowed them to do it.  And perhaps
they didn't konw it was configured to run as relay.  But anyway, this
discussion is about client functionality, not server functionality.

I believe you are correct that you don't want to filter it out at the
privoxy level.  But I don't think it would result in a connection
failure, but rather that the exit node specification would not be
honored (other than by accident).
A long time ago I think there was a problem with the .exit... in the URL
being passed along to the website in the GET (or other) requests, which
sometimes caused problems.  Somebody correct me if I am wrong, but I
believe now something in the tor chain of software (client, relays,
exit) filters that out.

Can you provide a link to what you are talking about?  I just searched

online manual
(  ,
v 1.60 2009/03/21 12:58:53) and I didn't see anything about changing
configuration that had substantively changed since I started using
privoxy 3+ years ago.  At *least* since that time there there has been
the ability to edit action files via browser (web interface) if allowed
in the configuration file.  The configuration file itself had to be
manually edited, and, at least in *nix, the config file could be owned
by root and set to be not writeable by privoxy (assuming privoxy was
running w/o privilege).  You could also toggle "enable/disable" through
privoxy's web interface if allowed in the config file. It should be
noted that "disabling" merely turns off the application of the rules --
it does *not* affect packet routing.  So if something was sent via Tor
with privoxy "enabled," it is still sent through Tor with privoxy
"disabled."  I have specifically verified that using

I guess that would depend on the OS and how it is configured.  If Tor is
running without privilege, as recommended, I would think in most
scenarios it would not have the ability to update itself.  If something
is configured "non-standard" (whatever that may mean in a particular
situation) then I would guess the attempt to update would not have the
desired result even if Tor had privilege.  That said, it is my
understanding that on MS Windows, Firefox has such an auto-update
mechanism although I am not familiar with the details.  Personally, I
like to be in charge of what happens on my computers.
I remain unconvinced that what happened in the case of "tbreg" should be
determining policy for the Tor project, at least as far as client
activity is concerned.  To the extent the people who installed really
didn't know it involved Tor, it seems to me that, if not technically
malware, it is at least a close cousin (where software creators are not
being up front with users).  Trying to, in effect, be the guardian of
such users is (IMHO) a losing proposition.

@_subject: Best practice for DNS through tor 
If you have an unused LAN address that is guaranteed to get routed to
your gateway for forwarding, then I *think* the following should work. Set your gateway up to redirect any packets sent to this address on port
53 to port 5300 on the gateway (I am just parroting what I think you
said above w/o having any experience about Tor's DNS capabilities;
please adjust details for any misunderstanding I have).  A user would
then use the normal gateway address for normal DNS.  Using the "new"
address would cause the request to go to 5300.  I.e. this changes the
problem from altering the desitnation port to altering the destination
address.  So the problem then is providing a mechanism for the user to
change the entry in resolv.conf
I would think that should work.  (I've done similar DNATing -- with DNS
even! :-)  Something like:
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 \
   -j DNAT --to-destination $router_ip:5300
And then you need to make sure you don't have any filtering rules
blocking that.  And you could add an analogous rule for tcp/53 if you
feel you need it.

For maybe I couple of years it has been almost impossible for me to use
Google's search via Tor.  (It keeps calling me a virus.)  Somebody
eventually told me about Scroogle ( ) which I have had good luck with via Tor.  I *think* that recently,
after Google flags you as "suspicious activity" it allows you to proceed
with a captcha *if* you accept cookies. Not a good way to remain
anonymous unless you immediately delete the cookies.
(When I first tried to use Tor I had some, now long forgotten, problem. Google-analytics was my motivation for solving the problem.)
If you are talking about "error 999" (Yahoo's term), I have occasionally
had problems with that for a long time.  Recently it seems to have
become routine.  You can immediately go to the captcha login for email
(which I don't have trouble with from Tor) with:
(of course, Yahoo might break that link at any time)  Be aware that
although *login* to Yahoo mail is https, the other transmissions are in
clear text.  So you are exposing your email (both send and receive) to
exit nodes.
P.S.  After seeing bao song's post, I remembered I have fiddled with
Privoxy's settings to keep it from mangling Yahoo mail.  But I have
routed Yahoo's mail clear text straight to the Internet to avoid any
exit node mischief.  I send the https login via Tor because it it too

Scott, when I did a "reply" on your email, it (tried to) sent it your
personal email account rather than the list.
I did not not mean it was not technically free software.  The license
takes care of that.  My meaning is that the goal is to restrict people
rather than to grant freedom.  It is an issue of perspective rather than
license technicalities.  I probably could have phrased it better.
(I happen to like, to the extent I understand it, GPLv3.  But I don't
see how it is relevant to this discussion and I don't know why it was
injected into it.)
That is why I inserted the ellipsis and made the parenthetical comment
about it.  I am not arguing against neutralizing insecure relays.  The
danger to the network is perfect justification IMO.
It's not like the clients ended up there on their own w/o the consent of
the user or owner.  Trying to enforce a policy on people when those
people are not harming others reeks (IMO) of unsavory things like police
states and nanny states.  I am opposed.  It is personal perspective, not
technical argument.  Obviously, it is technically possible to do what
you describe.  And because of the free license, it is technically
possible and legally permissible for people to undo those changes on
their copies of the software.  It is also possible for the software to
lie to the network about what it is.  But as I stated, this attitude of
trying to coerce other people baffles me.  I am not saying nobody does
it.  The world is full of tyrants.
Just to flesh out my view a little more, I would have no problem with a
configuration option that says "allow the tor network to nearly disable
this client at  discretion."  As long as it could be
disabled.  But I really wonder why Tor developers would be interested in
spending the time to implement such a thing.
By stealth???  If that is really so, I guess you could try to make the
same argument about *any* free software that somebody decided to turn
into malware.  But I am still unconvinced the people who installed
didn't know they were installing something.
I did not reproduce Pei Hanru's email in its entirety because I did not
see it as necessary.  Or particularly relevant for this discussion.  As
I stated, "I don't think the unsavory purpose these 'tbreg' instances
are put to is a relevant factor."  The unsavory purpose I referred to
and perhaps what you call "relevant context" is the fact that Tor was
part of software sold to (for the purpose of) (quoting Pei Hanru)
"automatically register large number of TaoBao accounts." It is my
opinion (yes, once again, *opinion*) that the fact that an unscrupulous
person (or group of people) used the free software in question in a
manner that *might* be analogous to certain freeware (*not* free
software) actually being a trojan, i.e. malware that arguably was
installed "by stealth," is not justification for taking a tyrannical
attitude toward the users of said free software, in this case, Tor.
If there is "relevant context" that is eluding me, please inform me
about it.
BTW, if the person/group/company which sold the software Pei Hanru
referred to violated the license Tor is released under, I have no
problems with people seeking legal redress.  It is just what I view as a
tyrannical attitude toward users that I find abhorrent.
Lest I again be accused of not providing relevant context, here is what
I take to be the (arguably) relevant (for the discussion of disabling
software against a user's wish) part of Pei Hanru's email.  Please
inform me if I am still missing the context to which you refer:
BTW, I have already thanked Pei Hanru in a different email for tracking
this down.  Nothing I have said in this email should in any way be
construed as critical of Pei Hanru.  I appreciate the effort in tracking
this down and posting the results to the mailing list.

You might want to look into using something like Scroogle
(  ).  I thnk Scroogle scrubs those redirects.
Google was actually the motivating factor in causing me to get serious about overcoming whatever problem I had when I first tried to use Tor. Although my concern at the time was more the ubiquity of google-analytics.  But still concerned about using their search engine.   My problem was that (for quite a while now), when I try to do a search on Google via Tor, more often than not Google calls me a virus and tells me to go away ("unusual network activity" or some such).  My solution has been to connect to Scroogle via Tor.  I am not nearly as anti-Google as the guy (people?) who run Scroogle and I don't mind the unobtrusive right column adds on Google search results.  Its just my (usual) inability to use Google directly w/o dropping anonymity.

Yes.  I've long recognized that one of the possible ironies in my story is that google-analytics motivated me to get off my duff and get Tor working.  However, in the process of setting up Tor I found out that Privoxy could very nicely take care of google-analytics on its own.  But as I've alluded to, while google-analytics was the top motivator for me, there is other motivation from Google (as search engine) and others wishing to track me.
Others more knowledgeable than I may wish to comment on this, but I believe I have read that it is not a good idea to combine NoScript with Tor.  I can't give you the gory details.  While I don't know the details of how NoScript handles google-analytics, I do know (on the last version I checked) that by default Privoxy won't allow anything from google-analytics to load, including their script(s).

This might be a good time to bring up a concern that has been on my mind for a while.  I don't know if this is one of the concerns that has already been identified when thinking about a much larger relay pool.
I connect to the Internet with dialup.  I have been successfully using Tor clients for 4+ years.  One of the issues with using Tor over a slow connection is the amount of time it takes to update the information about the network when Tor is first started after having been off-line for a while.  Depending on connection speed and how long the client has been off-line, this typically takes about 3 to 10 minutes.  Perhaps a bit longer.  My experience is that during this time the connection is pretty much useless for any other purpose.
While inconvenient, this situation is certainly manageable.  My concern has been what happens as the Tor network grows.  At some point the delay would start being a serious problem.  So as you think about how to change the directory mechanisms to handle a significantly larger number of relays I request that you also think about changing how this information is distributed to clients.  Perhaps with a much larger Tor network, each client doesn't actually have to know about all of the nodes but can make do with a reasonably sized "sampling."  Or maybe there is a way to spread out over time the increased amount of information available.
I can imagine that a solution to the problems a slow connection has might not be acceptable for relays.  As such, maybe there could be a "slow connection" option in torrc that would not be used by relays.
Thanks for giving consideration to this issue.

Hi Daniel,
I am surprised that nobody on this list that is more knowledgeable than I has responded to your request.
I am certainly no expert here, but based both on what has been posted on this list previously and the TLS entries that ended up in your debug log, I would have to wonder if your problem doesn't have to do with an incompatibilty between the version of Tor you are using and the version of SSL you are using rather than being a problem with your school's filtering Tor.  I did not respond sooner in part because, based on my (admittedly limited) understanding of these issues, I did not see a conflict between what you posted you were using, based on recent other posts about this.  Still there have been recent (say the last 6 months or so) issues between Tor and SSL.  I can only hope that either you can research this some yourself or somebody else with more knowledge about this will post.
Good luck!

So let me just float an idea here that maybe others can

What if families could be "declared" by giving them a name (say XYZ123)
and publishing a public key for them.  Then to add a node to the family,
the server operator would issue a BelongToFamily XYZ123 declaration that
is somehow signed by the corresponding private key.  If the details can
be worked out correctly, then only the person/organization with access
to the private key can add servers to that family. I think  that would
take care of Roger' concern about relay operators adding their server to
others' families.  If this is too much information to reasonably contain
in a torrc file, then perhaps it could be included in a separate file.
Either one the Tor client automatically looks for or one referenced in

I am very far from an expert in these matters, but it would seem to me that the ability to do so without the explicit cooperation of the browser (or other client) would indicate that your attempt at end-to-end encryption was hopelessly broken.  If you could de/re-encapsulate then so could any other man-in-the-middle, and you would never be the wiser.
But I do understand the usefulness of what you suggest.  The only way I can see of doing it that had any possibility of being secure would be if A) your proxy/cache handled the real end-to-end encryption/authentication with the website, and B) there was a plugin (or built-in functionality) on the browser that maintained a secure AND AUTHENTICATED connection with the proxy/cache.  I.e. the browser would have to be aware of what was going on and would suspend its verification of the website's certificate while insisting that it authenticate that it was talking to the approved proxy/cache which is tasked with the secure communication to the website. If the proxy/cache detected a problem with the website's certificate, then it would have to have a way of signalling this, perhaps just by serving up its own page with the relevant information.
That's the best I can come up with.  Comments?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hijacking Advertising to give a Tor Exit node 
IMNSHO, as far as "official discussion" (at least as "official" as this
mailing list ;-) goes, the answer to the question of it being an
acceptable idea dictates whether it even makes sense to consider
spreadsheets.  Of course, doing any kind of arbitrary spreadsheet
analysis, purely for private amusement, is up to the individual!
As far as I am concerned, if such hijacking did not immediately lead to
bad exit designations, then Tor would no longer be suitable for anything
w/o end-to-end encryption.  (Of course, some feel it already is
unsuitable for clear text ... :-)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Weird Scroogle Problem 
Hi all,
This may be a bit OT, but I was wondering if anybody else has had a
similar problem.  A couple of times recently I have used some search
terms in Scroogle, accessed via Tor, and the search worked fine.  I then
added site:wikipedia.org to the search and got:
   Forbidden
   You don't have permission to access /cgi-bin/ on this server.
When this happened a few minutes ago, I then tried the terms:
   any old thing site:wikipedia.org
and again got the error.  I repeated that last search w/o Tor (but still
using https) and there was no error.
Anybody else seen this?  Anybody have a clue what is going on?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor 0.2.3.9-alpha is out 
Just a thought for your consideration ...
I am wondering if this follows the principle of least surprise, at
least with regard to logging.  I was initially baffled why this release
was not logging anything to the system log and thought it to be a bug.
I then realized that the config file's "Log notice syslog" had been
disabled by the command line's --log "notice stdout", which I was piping
to a script.  Expected behavior returned when I changed --log to --+log.
Also, as best I can figure out, this change is not reflected in the man
page (revised Dec 8, 2011).  In addition to skimming the man page, I
searched for both "+" and "plus".
Best regards,

@_subject: [tor-talk] New to List 
You can use iptables to monitor for port 53 usage by adding a couple of
rules to the beginning of the OUTPUT chain:
        sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53
        sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 53
These rules will count the number of UDP and TCP packets sent to port
53.  They won't filter or log anything to the system log.
After doing some browsing via Tor, you can check if any packets have
matched either rule with:
        sudo iptables -nvL OUTPUT | head
The verbose (-v) option will cause packet counts to be included in the
output.  If those are zero, you are good to go.  There is the
*possibility* of a false positive if one of the tor nodes you access
uses TCP/53. :-(
Alternatively, you can use tcpdump or wireshark to directly monitor for
port 53 packets.  For example:
       sudo tcpdump -nni any port 53
Be aware that if you don't use the -n option, any of the commands
above may *themselves* do DNS lookup! :-O
Chris's suggestion of blocking direct Internet access is also good if
the restriction doesn't cause a problem for you.  The following will
block all traffic for "username" on all interfaces except loopback.
(Obviously, the Tor software must be running as a different user.)
        sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -o ! lo --m owner \
           --uid-owner username -j REJECT
If you need that user to be able to access a LAN or something then the
filtering becomes slightly more complicated, but still easy.  I run a
local DNS caching service, so I also block that user on port 53 on *all*
interfaces, *including* loopback:
        sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -m owner \
           --uid-owner username -j REJECT
        sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 53 -m owner \
           --uid-owner username -j REJECT
I prefer REJECT to DROP for these purposes so that I get immediate
feedback that something is being blocked, but you can use DROP if you
prefer silence.

Presumably some people will be running live CDs (or USBs) on systems
where they don't have the necessary privilege to set the system time.
To address these situations, what might be more useful is to be able to
tell Tor to offset the system clock by a given amount to get the "real
time".  Possbily in connection with this there could be a setting which
would cause Tor to automically determine this offset at initialization.

First, thank you for implementing this.
I've download, compiled, and installed version 0.2.3.2-alpha.  I
previously ran version 0.2.1.30.  I did not delete or alter ~/.tor between versions.  I've added the following line to torrc:

So far, after a brief test, everything seems to be fine.  I was curious
about what was logged and wondering if it represents any kind of an
error or bug.  The full log is listed at the end of this email.  The
lines I am wondering about are:

I am wondering if the first line is accurately reporting the state when
52 seconds later (with a 52kbps connection) it reports it has enough
information to build circuits and 100 seconds after which, it reports
100% bootstrapped and stops downloading data (observer using iftop).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Request for Help Configuring Torbutton for Remote 
I don't see why.  I run Tor/Privoxy as a server on a computer with a
single ethernet device (no wireless) just fine.  I usually use SSH
tunnels to send data from client machines instead of connecting to
Privoxy directly from the LAN, but I don't see how that fundamentally
changes anything.  (I just did a quick check w/o the SSH tunnel and it seemed to work fine.)  You would have to make sure that Polipo or Privoxy (or Tor, if using it w/o a proxy) is listening on the LAN connection and make sure any firewall is configured appropriately.
Now if you want to *force* the clients to use Tor, via transparent proxy
or otherwise, rather than access the Internet directly, you might need
two interfaces.  I really haven't thought that one through

Perhaps it would be a good idea to add a few more words to that page to

these is:
     REMARK(S) ABOUT THIS TOR USAGE CONCLUSION
        This conclusion is valid only for your current webbrowser
     connections and not general for all other applications, because
     they each depend on an individual configuration which cannot be
     checked here!
        Are you running a Tor server node (by pressing 'act as
     server' on Vidalia, f.e.) AND is this your Home-IP? Then you're
     most probably NOT using Tor to reach the web! In this case I
     cannot make a clear decision for you. You are at you own, to
     compare your ISPs given IP and the above shown IP by yourself
     (if they are different, you are using Tor).
        The EXIT-state is concluded by TorDNSEL at
     'exitlist.torproject.org' only. We have no local data about this
     node.
But even on that web site that information seems a bit too buried IMHO.
It also may not be clear and concise enough for more casual users.

Requiring SSL for Tor searches is all well and good, but it creates a
problem that I haven't found a solution for:  creating "bookmarks".  The
(SSL) page of search results has a link to "how to create a bookmark"
which is *not* https.  Attempting to use this page to create a
"bookmark" via Tor gets blocked because of the SSL requirement.  Trying
to load the same page via https results in an error.  It would be really
nice if you could create a solution to this.  Or, if a solution already
exists, post the solution here.

OK.  Thanks.
I hadn't thought it through this far, but I was looking for automatic creation of such links, such as provided through the "how to make a bookmark" link.  I assume you created your sample link manually?
A search such as your sample link looks easy enough to construct.  I am not sure it would be immediately obvious to me what the query would be for more advanced searches such as including a quoted phrase, using the site: qualifier, etc.  So it would still be nice to have a way to automatically create them such as Scroogle provides for plain http.  Not just for more complicated searches but also for even simple searches by people who are less computer conversant.
P.S.  I concur that using POST by default is a good thing!  :-)  But "bookmarks" are occasionally useful also.  (I've needed those maybe two or three times a year.)

I don't know if this is what you are talking about or not, but a while back I noticed port 22 (the traditional SSH port) traffic I wasn't expecting on one of my machines.  Checking tor's cached-descriptors file I noticed one or more tor nodes was using port 22 as one of its ports (I forget which one) and this was what I was observing.

@_author: Jim 
@_subject: [tor-talk] tor using SSH 
Sorry I was not more clear.   The connection was between a high numbered
port on my machine and port 22 on the remote machine.  The
cached-descriptors file showed me that the remote IP address was a Tor
node that listened (for some purpose) on port 22.  On the basis of that
information I presumed the traffic I was seeing was legitimate Tor
traffic and I did not investigate further.  I was running a Tor client
but not a relay, so I *presume* my machine initiated that connection but
I never tried to verify that.  (My firewall should have prevented any
incoming connections.)
I believe Andrew Lewman and others on this list have since given a more complete explanation of what is going on.

Part of this legislation involves attempting to prevent DNS from resolving "offensive" domain names.  The part that seems like it could potentially affect Tor (in my non-lawyer) mind is:

Hi All,
I just discovered empirically that to allow the MapAddress option to
work, AllowDotExit must be set to 1.
1)  While perhaps this was written between the lines, I didn't find it
spelled out out anywhere.  If it is to remain this way, perhaps this
should be explicitly spelled out in the man page.  Which brings me
to ...
2)  Is this behavior desirable?  As I understand it, the reason the
AllowDotExit option exists in the first place is because it is dangerous
to allow dot exit notation from the browser and using dot exit notation
from the browser causes other problems.  If one or more MapAddress
directives are included in torrc, it seems pretty obvious that they are
intended to be followed.  Should AllowDotExit be changed so that it only
applies to dot exit notation from the browser and MapAddress directives
are followed regardless?

       torcheck.xenobite.eu..exit
(as one line) to torrc to cause torcheck.xenobite.eu to use the exit
    node  whereupon, torcheck.xenobite.eu became unreachable.  Adding
   AllowDotExit 1
caused torcheck.xenobite.eu to display the IP address of .
Is there another way to use MapAddress (or other directive) to
achieve that goal?
I used the name of the desired exit because I could not find how to use
the fingerprint.  I know that information has appeared on this

Hi All,
Perhaps a few days ago when I was trying to access Hushmail via Tor I was told my "computer" was blocked, possibly because of abuse.  A quick modification of torrc to exlcude a few particular exit nodes let me access Hushmail.  Afterwards, I reverted torrc, removing the exclusions, and I have subsequently used Hushmail several times w/o problems. Tonight I am having problems again and this time I am seeing the problems on a number of different exit nodes.  I am wondering if essentially the whole Tor network has become poisoned as far as Hushmail is concerned.
Is anybody else seeing any problems?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Anybody else having problems with Hushmail via Tor? 
Thanks for your response.
Since I brought this topic up, perhaps I should provide an update to the
list.  As mentioned, the first time I saw the problem it went away when
I changed exit nodes.  The second time the problem became persistent
over several days and several different exit nodes.  I finally attempted
to connect to Hushmail directly (no tor/no anonymity) and found that
apparently my account had been locked.  Using their contact form, I
"explained what happened" and they unlocked my account.  I suspect the
response I got from them was auto-generated; there was no mention of Tor
in it.
.From this experience, I *suspect* (do not know) that using Hushmail via
Tor runs the risk of getting your account locked.  They run undisclosed
software to detect "abuse" and this software takes action automatically.
They did state that IP address is one of the factors considered .  I
gather one form of "abuse" in their eyes is opening a large number of
free accounts.  Conjecture:  I suspect, based on IP address they
concluded I was the owner of a number of other Hushmail accounts.

I don't have a solution to this problem but I am raising it in case
somebody else does.  It's great that you not only sign your packages but
that the page above also lists the fingerprints of the signing keys.
But in case of a man-in-the-middle attack (or a compromised website) the
attacker could provide his own signatures for trojaned packages and then
display a page that shows the signature for *his* signing key(s) in
place of those for the real keys.
I presume the general method of solving this for PGP keys is to create a
chain of trust by signing the keys.  But it is not clear to me how that
would work for a project like Tor that distributes software to all
comers where "signing parties" and the like are out of the question.

This is correct as far as it goes.  You can verify that the software that was download was signed with a particular private key.  The problem is knowing whether that key, in fact, belongs to the Tor Project.
torproject.org does list the key they use on their web site.  The problem then returns back to knowing if the web page you are looking at to verify the key is the real one or a fake.  Which I believe is where the OP began.  How does he know if the web page is correct when he cannot trust the SSL certificate.
I seem to recall that one of the people from the Tor Project stated that
some browsers now have the correct Tor Project SSL certificate "baked
into them".  I don't have the time to go looking for that right now but
perhaps somebody can refresh all of our memories?

Yes.  There is a clear difference between the two issues.  When Scroogle

My issues with Scroogle have been going on for over two months.
(Irritatingly enough, I started having problems with Scroogle
immediately after I finally got around to giving them a small donation.)
My experience is that at any given time they are blocking most but
(usually) not all Tor exits.  If I am patient enough, Tor sometimes
finds an exit that works.  I have sometimes made a stab at what exit
worked and used MapAddress to force that exit, which usually works for a
while.  I have also sometimes used Tor -> Web Proxy -> Scroogle, but
usually before I get to that point I just use IxQuick (which is
painfully slow on dial-up).

In both cases my friends checked and indeed their accts. had been compromised.  Neither person had any idea how their acct. got compromised and I am reasonably sure neither had ever used Tor.  Both swore they had not been phished. One had a Hotmail acct. and I think the other used mail.com.  My point is that attacks against email accts. w/o using Tor to do it is apparently commonplace, something that seems to be confirmed in that "Abuse at Scale PDF that a Google employee linked to from this list a while back.

associated with some data returned by the site didn't match any known
Tor 'nodes,' the computers that bounce information through Tor's

I don't see how that is possible, regardless how badly misconfigured the
server is.  When the server is accessed as a Tor hidden service it
doesn't know the client's IP address.  So the only way it can respond is
back through Tor.  Unless by "typing miscellaneous strings" they managed
to infect the server with something that contacted an FBI machine via
clearnet, similar to Magneto.  Am I missing something?  Or are they

You might be able to create something useful to the user much more simply just from keeping track of normal operation (w/o running extra tests).  Perhaps after a bridge the software tried to use could not be reached a certain number of times over a certain number of days the user could be prompted with something like: "We were unable to contact such and such bridge the last 7 attempts over the last 3 days.  Would you like to remove it from it from your list of bridges?"
This would reduce the complexity of both the software required and the information provided to a user who otherwise might feel overwhelmed with statistical data.  Plus the software wouldn't take any action w/o the user's knowledge and consent.  (If the user declines when first notified, the software could stop prompting him (so as not be annoying) but maintain a menu option where the user could see updated statistics (bridge unreachable n times in last m days) and where he could still delete the bridge from the list if he so chose.)

but presumably the procedure hasn't changed.  You need to find and
download an .iso image from the internet or obtain it from another
source.  Hopefully the creators of the image provide a way to verify
that the image you get is correct and unaltered (PGP signature, a signed
list of secure hashes, etc).  You should verify your image.  Then you
need to burn the image to a CD or DVD (as appropriate) *as an image*.
You can find instructions on the Internet about how to to this.  Do
*not* just write it to the optical disk as a file.  Put the disk in
your computer and boot to it.  You will then be running from the optical
disk and there should be no hard drive access unless you specifically
request it.
There are multiple live systems to choose from.  Probably all will give
you Internet access but some/many may not include Tor.  TAILs does
include Tor and is specifically set up to direct all Internet traffic
through Tor.  There may be others.  You should be able to find any
additional information you need through searching the Internet.
My impression is these days it is more common to run live systems from
thumb drives than optical disks.  But I specifically mentioned CD/DVDs
because they are read-only media and therefore can't get infected
(assuming your original image is clean).
Live systems auto-detect hardware and will usually "just work" with the hardware you have.  If it doesn't you need to either find a different live system or different hardware.  But if your hardware works with standard Linux I wouldn't expect a problem.

As I stated in an earlier email I am out of date on this but in the "old days" this was certainly not true.  In the original Knoppix (which is the grandfather of all live systems TMK) if you had the memory there was a mode where you could load the image into memory, but this was not necessary.  If you did load the image into memory things ran a lot faster.  But the only files that *had to* reside in memory were those that were writable.  Over the years there have been at least two different methods allowing writable files that reside in memory to dynamically and transparently be used in place of the read-only files on the original image.
I have certainly run live CDs on computers that had much less RAM than the size of the CD.

If your ~3GB of virtual machine data had to be read during the boot
process I would think that would change the situation dramaticly.

Ben is right about not using root for routine tasks.  But you can
still follow your original idea by creating one or more
*nonprivileged* accounts for non-internet tasks.  Even w/o using
VMs you can block these accounts from *initiating* connections to
the Internet with iptables rules.  If you set up permissions
correctly, then so long as malware does not achieve root level
privilege the information in these non-internet accounts should
remain safe.  So you have a range of options from no VMs to fully
isolated VMs on separate machines to running a live CD/DVD for
internet access.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Ports required for Tor and hidden services 
Roger gave a good reply for the case where the system is not breached. But if your firewall is on the same system as the hidden service and an attacker gets root then nothing can save you since the attacker could alter the firewall at will.  The only exception I can think of is SELinux *might* provide a mechanism to prevent this but I am not familiar with it.
