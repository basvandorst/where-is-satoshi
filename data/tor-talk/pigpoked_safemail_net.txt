@_subject: Dupe named exit nodes, friend or foe? 
Twice, I've received the, "Sorry, you're not using tor" message on the tor check page. I checked one tor node listing website, the exit node IP listed on the "Sorry" page was a recently added exit node which had a duplicate name of another exit node. This duplicate exit node was listed as down, the other real exit node was up but with a different IP. I searched my cached listings in ~/.tor and this "Sorry" paged duplicate named "down" node was listed within the recent "new" listing of nodes.
How is it I was using a dupe node? How is it a node listed as down could be in use? How is it a node with a duplicate name with a different IP from the other preexisting node could exist? From this information, I would consider this a bad exit node, but I need input. I didn't retain the dupe node name, IP, or fingerprint. Is this behavior normal or expected? If this is rogue behavior, do we report these findings to this list or if these nodes are bad are they automatically culled?

@_subject: torrc placement w/o make install 
I installed tor v0.2.0.34 from source, Linux. I run tor from /src/or, after running ./configure && make, omitting make install. It works well. As it starts, one message is:
[notice] Configuration file "/usr/local/etc/tor/torrc" not present, using reasonable defaults.
As I opted not to run make install, it appears I have no torrc file. If I desired to use a torrc file, should I pluck the sample from one of the directories inside /src/or and copy it to /usr/local/etc/tor/torrc to prevent this message from showing and to make use of the torrc file, or, being as this isn't a system wide install, should I place the torrc file elsewhere within /src/or?
What "reasonable defaults" are used when torrc is not present? What cons exist in not using a torrc file? I run tor in client mode only

@_subject: Persistant SSL? 
It's encouraged to use SSL across tor rather than unencrypted HTTP. Most of the websites I view do not offer SSL. How is it possible to maintain a persistant SSL experience on the web with tor excluding the few sites offering SSL? I've discovered some commerical web proxies offering SSL accounts for X amount per month and read a small amount of VPN services at cost. Bearing in mind the nature of tor, it doesn't seem rational to me to rely on one SSL/VPN provider at cost, both requiring potential disclosure of personal information for the billing processes.
I have no desire to attempt any form of potential anonymous financial transactions due to the pitfalls within, including but not limited to - if I pseudo-anonymously pay for a service and I'm ripped off what recourse do I have? If you are enjoying persistant SSL when using tor, what is your legit/legal method? Would there be a program for this?

@_subject: Hackers exploiting tor clients on .onion sites? 
I explored a few of the common .onion sites listed at Wikipedia's tor page listed within the external links footer. These sites loaded well, but I noticed several errors in my tor client logs. I googled for info on the errors, some of the error messages turned up in cvs related pages and bug talks, but lacked definite information. I didn't retain the error messages, but I won't be visiting .onion sites in the future as it feels to me by the open nature of some of the .onion sites where users post messages or edit wikis anonymously, malicious users may have the ability to target the small audience of users at these sites: tor users and their clients. I only discovered these errors when visiting a few .onion sites.
My tor client did not exhibit strange behavior during or after these error messages were displayed, but as some of the error messages appeared entirely in CAPS, I thought to post here. As I didn't retain the error messages, this post is vague - sorry! I am concerned. This is not to discourage others from visiting .onion sites, but to raise awareness about the possibility of rogue behavior on some .onion sites, most probably by anonymous users, not the .onion admins.
Should this concern me? What steps could be taken to safeguard the tor client from possible attacks, if any, from .onion websites? Am I considering errors too seriously?
Hello, my final thread for this day, thank you.
