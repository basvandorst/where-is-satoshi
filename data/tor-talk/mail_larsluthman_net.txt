You could try tracking down some Tor relays that listen on port 443 and
set those as entry guards, if the blocking is done by port number those
are likely to be accessible since it's the port used by HTTPS. If they
are actually blocking all known Tor nodes by address you may have to ask
for a bridge.

You can try to find an open HTTPS-capable proxy that Ebay hasn't blocked
and use that to hide the fact that you are using Tor from Ebay (so your
traffic first goes through Tor and then through the web proxy). Be
careful not to leak any information, though - any unencrypted traffic
will be seen both by the Tor exit node and the other proxy.

If you choose 'Show all bookmarks' from the 'Bookmarks' menu, you get a
dialog window with an 'Import and backup' menu that you can use to
export the bookmarks to a JSON file and then import them again in the
new browser.
I am not aware of any upgrade method other than simply replacing the
browser directory as you are doing.

If the service uses an unencrypted protocol the obvious benefit of the
hidden service is that the data is encrypted all the way to the host.
Also, even if it is encrypted, a hidden service should at least in
theory be more resistant to a man-in-the-middle attack than normal TLS,
unless you use certificate pinning in the client.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Including Adblock to TBB to save bandwith 
I like ad blockers and use them myself with and without Tor, but having
one enabled by default in the Tor Browser would give website operators
an incentive to block Tor users.
That doesn't mean that it's a bad idea, but it's definitely a factor
that needs to be considered.

That depends on whether they can distinguish between connections made by
different Tor processes coming from the same network. Hopefully they
can't, in which case it's both 1 and 2, but if the two Tor processes are
different versions of Tor or use different versions of libraries such as
OpenSSL it might be possible to tell the connections apart, in which
case it's only 2.

And considering the existence of systems like Torchat where every user
has their own hidden service used only for private communication, it's
plausible that a large part of the hidden services, maybe even a
majority, have nothing to do with the web at all.

The size of your window can leak information that reduces your
anonymity, at least if Javascript is enabled (maybe even if it's
disabled?). I suspect that TBB has been intentionally modified to start
with the same window size every time.
It sounds odd that it starts with the title bar off-screen though.

9050 is the default for the stand-alone 'tor' program. The 'tor' that is
bundled with the Tor Browser uses 9150 to avoid conflicts with any
separately installed 'tor'.
Torbirdy assumes by default that you use the 'tor' that comes with the
Tor Browser instead of a separate one. If you want to use the one from
the Debian/other package, just change the port.

Sounds like you should use the TrackHostExits and TrackHostExitsExpire
options in the Tor config file. The first sets a list of domains for
which Tor should try to use the same exit relay for a given amount of
time, specified using the second. For example
TrackHostsExits .example.org
TrackHostsExitsExpire 7200
will tell Tor to try to use the same exit relay for all subdomains of
example.org for 2 hours (7200 seconds). See the manual for more
information:

@_subject: [tor-talk] Darknet Sites Shutdown 
The article claims 400 sites but only 17 arrests, which could indicate
that some individuals were running many, many hidden services, in which
case a few mistakes would be enough. That's how I would do it if I
wanted to take over the online drug market*, create a couple of dozens
of sites with slightly different designs, rules, and clienteles so that
people think that there is lots of diversity, and then sit back and let
the transaction fees flow in. Doesn't matter if twenty sites fail as
long as one succeeds, and the users have no way of knowing that the
failed sites and the one they trust are operated by the same people.
That doesn't mean that there _isn't_ an exploit. We will probably never
know the details.
* I don't.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Can Tor run over Tor? 
I have done it accidentally with a misconfigured transparent proxy that
sent its own Tor traffic to its own transparent proxying port. It
worked, though a bit slower (as expected).
I don't think it would be any more secure. The most serious publically
known attacks against the anonymity of Tor users (browser bugs etc
notwithstanding) are correlation attacks where the attacker compare
traffic at the client end with traffic at exit nodes and see if it looks
similar in timing and data sizes. A six-relay circuit (which is what you
get when running Tor over Tor) doesn't change that at all.
An attack where the traffic is actually traced all the way through the
Tor relays would be harder, but those are probably not the attacks we
should be worrying about in the first place. And a longer circuit may
make it more likely that an attacker can correlate traffic _inside_ the
circuit as well.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor over SSH (torsocks) (?) 
Step 1: Install Tor ('apt-get install tor' on Debian)
Step 2: Create a directory where the HS data will be stored         ('mkdir /var/lib/tor/ssh-hs && chown debian-tor.debian-tor /var/lib/tor/ssh-hs'
        on Debian, as root)
Step 3: Add the following lines to the Tor configuration file:
        (/etc/tor/torrc on Debian):
          HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/ssh-hs/
          HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
Step 4: Make Tor reload its configuration file ('service tor reload') or
        simply restart Tor ('service tor restart').
Step 5: Read the hidden service address from
        /var/lib/tor/ssh-hs/hostname, write it down somewhere.
Once Tor has had a couple of minutes to get the service descriptor onto the
network, try to connect ('usewithtor ssh your_hs_address.onion').
It's definitely not more complicated than setting up a VPN or much more
complicated than using SSH in general.

@_subject: [tor-talk] do Cloudfare captchas ever work? 
That's the only way that ever works for me. Or turning Javascript on,
but I don't want to do that for HTTP sites.
With Javascript on you usually get easier captchas that often let you
through when you get them right. With Javascript off you get the
captchas that look like the names of Lovecraftian deities distorted
through non-Euclidean geometries that are difficult even for us humans
to solve, and even when you definitely solve them you aren't allowed
through but just get presented with another captcha, and another, and
another, ad infinitum.
Switching to different exits helps, but you often have to switch 10 - 20
times in a row before you hit an exit relay that Cloudflare in their
benevolent wisdom has deemed good enough to be allowed to view the web.
And even then you usually just get a few minutes before the gate is
slammed shut and you're back with the captchas.
I suspect that the new exit-switching feature in Tor Browser has made it
slightly worse by putting more load on the few exits that are allowed
through at any given time, making it more likely that Cloudflare will
think it's some sort of DoS attack or automated scraper and block it.
Cloudflare has essentially broken the web for Tor users.
For some reason web proxies like hidemyass.com never seem to be blocked
by Cloudflare so one (annoying) solution is to use one of those with Tor

Replying to my own lamentation here - has anyone else noticed that it
seems to have got a lot better in the last week? The captchas are still
impenetrable without Javascript but most of the time it's enough to
switch circuits one or two times to get one without captchas, and you
stay captcha-free for much longer.

Are you trying to connect to that address using the Tor Browser? That

The Freenet documentation recommends using a normal browser in privacy
"For best security you should use a separate browser for Freenet,
preferably in privacy mode. On Windows, the system tray menu will try to
use Chrome in incognito mode if possible. Internet Explorer does not
work well with Freenet, Firefox and Opera are widely used."

@_subject: [tor-talk] Friendly LAN bridge -- bad idea? 
I've thought of using a similar setup on local networks - configuring
the main router to run a private Tor bridge and blocking all other
traffic. The problem with this is that every normal circuit only gets
two hops out on the internet - your private bridge is the first hop, and
then there's a middle hop and an exit on the internet. Also, since the
private bridge would be the guard node and it is on your local network,
the first hops out on the internet would change much more frequently
than if you didn't use the private bridge but connected to guard nodes
out on the internet. Both of these properties may reduce the anonymity
of Tor users on your local network.
These problems would be avoided if
a) Tor treated all bridges as a 'zeroth hop' and built three-hop     circuits _after_ the bridge, with the first hop being chosen
    using the normal guard selection algorithm, or
b) There was a special 'local bridge' type which, when used,
    forced the client to build four-hop circuits with the above
    properties.
I don't think there's any way of achieving any of those without
modifying Tor.
