My TOR browser exhibits the following symptom. The graphics on its window  don't update unless I move the mouse pointer over it. Is this happening to anyone else?
Tor browser is 6.0.2, based on Mozilla 45.2.0, running on a Debian unstable.
 -srvm
Linux 4.6.0-1-amd64  SMP Debian 4.6.3-1 (2016-07-04) x86_64
Thanks in advance.
