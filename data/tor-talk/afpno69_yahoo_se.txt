@_subject: Tor uninstaller for Mac OS X as requested 
I read here:
that a Tor uninstaller for Mac OS X was wanted.
So I did one.
It's only a shell script but it will do the trick. :)
It removes all files specified here:
It would be great if somebody would like to try it out
and give me some feedback :)
