@_subject: [tor-talk] BBC: NSA and GCHQ agents 'leak Tor bugs', 
Interesting. We should remember that the spies are really living in a
two sided world. On one side, they need a reliable, hardened, Tor that
doesn't stand out from anyone else using Tor so that they can
communicate amongst themselves. On the other hand, they need to be able
to break Tor so they can do their jobs. It has to be a tough place for
them to be.
The article was very interesting - except the part about 'here's how you
might want to fix this'. I certainly hope that the Tor project /is not/
accepting patches submitted by NSA or GCHQ! Sure, I realize those
agencies could very easily embed someone within the project (in fact,
don't a few of the Tor project folks work in intel?) but developing a
trusting relationship by accepting patches just seems like a bad idea to me.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Third-parties tracking me on Tor 
Just a quick comment on creating a longer key. I see a lot of people
doing that and I think it's absolutely useless. As of now, we do not
believe that anyone has the computing power to break a 4096 bit RSA key
by brute force. The only way would be through a side attack. If a side
attack worked against a 4096 bit key, it would likely also work against
a 8k key as well.
There's no real benefit to creating a larger than 'standard' key at this

I'm running the cypherpunk1 exit and it's been running since last night.
For some reason, it simply refuses to show up in either Atlas or Globe

time just in case.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question about something said about Tor in the Der 
First, let me say I'm sorry if this is posted twice. My mail client gave
me an error and, since I still haven't seen it hit either list, I'm
sending it again. My apologies if this is a duplicate.
So I'm looking through the Der Spiegel data dump and noticed the
following statement on document 35543:
"The client must not be running a Tor router of their own..."
That made me thing of a few questions but I'm specifically wondering
what they mean here.
1. Do they mean that it is confusing to them if I am connecting to the
Tor network from a computer that also runs a relay but I do not have my
client configured to use my relay
2. Do they mean that it is confusing to them if I am connecting to the
Tor network through a relay running on my own machine?
Perhaps I'm not even asking this question correctly as it 'feels' like
the wrong way. But I'm curious. What are your thoughts?

Not only that, but it should be noted that there is a case for the government making something so strong that even they can't break it: China and a few other countries. They are working on breaking Tor too and, if the US can do it, it is just a matter of time before China will be able to.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why does requesting for bridges by email require a Yahoo 
With the recent discussion about what your ISP can see when you use Tor,
I ended up on the Tor Bridges page. On that page is the following statement:
"I need an alternative way of getting bridges!
Another way to get bridges is to send an email to
bridges at torproject.org. Please note that you must send the email using
an address from one of the following email providers: Gmail or Yahoo."
In light of the last year of disclosures by Edward Snowden, why is Tor
requiring that I establish an account with an email provider that is
completely out of my control and has a general history of complying with
law enforcement data requests? Why those two providers specically?
Note to conspiracy theorists: I am NOT intimating that Tor is in cahoots
with the government in any way and that's why they're requiring Yahoo
and Gmail so don't bother going there.
Can anyone shed some light on this?

2. Do I need to list the current relay in its own MyFamily variable or just every other relay I run excluding the current one?

I run the public XMPP server at chat.cpunk.us and I'd like to make the  service also available as a hidden service. I have a few questions:
1. Let's say my hidden service is xxxcf.onion. What would the users  final JID be? Would they still be user at chat.cpunk.us or would the  onion address come into play?
2. Is it necessary to actually configure a hidden service at all?  Can't users just point their SOCKS proxy capable XMPP client to the  server or does going through an onion address provide something else  in this case that I'm not aware of?
3. even though we run a Jingle node and act as a media relay, I assume  users still will not be able to do voice and video while connected to  our server over Tor. Is that correct? Is there any way to safely offer  voice and video to Tor connected users?
Thanks in advance,

Hmm, good points. Though I wonder if force might me something needed  in this case: use a properly functioning client or go elsewhere. My  reasoning is that I have to wonder if a developer who isn't capable of  writing DNS related code could be trusted to implement proper crypto.   Since our server tries to focus on secure communication, perhaps this  could be a teachable moment and help the Tor network at the same time.

Hello Everyone,
I'm configuring two hidden services on the same box (Ubuntu 14.04). In

For some reason, the second hidden service simply isn't working. Port
8008 is not being opened by Tor at all. I tried to telnet to it both
from localhost and a remote machine and it's failed. Checked that it was
allowed on the firewall and all that good stuff and everything looks ok.

Thank you for the prompt response Vignesh. I remember reading about this

isn't in danger if my identity leaks and I use PGP on my important

data leaked seems to be the local datetime, I'd think it's not a massive
concern since my local datetime is shared with a few million other people.
