@_subject: [tor-talk] Looking to write alternative to DNS2SOCKS... 
I am a software developer who has been trying to use DNS2SOCKS but haven't
had much success with it communicating with the latest TOR
Bundle. DNS2SOCKS doesn't seem to have any support to mention, so now am
looking to write an equivalent to DNS2SOCKS myself (possibly also with ip6
As this will be my first attempt at writing something that uses the TOR
network, I was wondering if anyone could tell me where I should go for the
specs I would need to write an alternative to DNS2SOCKS?

Not a Python man myself, but could come in handy. Thank you.

Note if anyone wants to use this utility, that they will need to re-compile
it so that it connects to Socket port 9150 and not 9050, as the 9050 port
is no longer being used by the TOR bundle.
Another issue is that the utility does not look to see if it's dependancies
are running and does not complain if their not.
Other than the above can confirm that DNS2SOCKS seems to run ok with the
latest TOR bundle.

No re-write of DNS2SOCKS required. Just needs to be re-compiled to use port
9150 instead of port 9050:-)
