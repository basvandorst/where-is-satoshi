@_subject: [tor-talk] Provider for relay 
Hi, I know this question has been answered before but I would like to
get an up to date opinion. without any issues. It pushed around 600GB of traffic every month. One
day the provider stopped my server and said that they don?t accept
TOR servers. I argued a bit and I told them I could lower the traffic
(even if the limit was announced with 600GB/month) but they said that
they are not interested doing business with me anymore. Great! Now the
message was clear! I also prepaid for one year, so they had still
about 100? and I asked to get it back. They answered that they will
refund the money but that never happened.  contribute again but I have no idea which provider I should choose. I
want to run a relay (no exit) and I?m looking for a cheap option
without any hassle.

Hi,
Could you do us all a favour and add that provider to , so that noone else gets into the same situation you were in?
