since downloading and using the new Tor browser, I cannot seem to be able to watch The Daily Show which requires adobe flash though I have previously used Tor and have installed the latest version of flash on my computer. The aurora browser does not seem to recognise it. any ideas?

Thank you for this, but I still cannot get it on my windows 7 browser via aurora.
I also have an ASUS eeepad with android 3 and have downloaded and installed orbot, gibberbot and orweb. I have followed all the instructions to do this, but my orweb keeps telling me I am not connected to tor, though my orbot says I am. Is there a different proxy port or prosy host that I should use other than localhost and port 8118?
I cannot seem to use adobe flash with mozilla - either with tor on windows 7 aurora browser though according to the site you have given below,  -  - not sure if I have that right, I have tried those settings, - no joy yet - though I can use it for non adobe flash sites.
I could be doing something wrong - I am not quite as computer saavvy as the people on this list seem to be - apologies.
But mozilla on my android cannot use flash either, so that is out - BUT I want to use the android when I travel, particularly to China, so I would like to know hot to get orweb to use tor. Thanks for being patient.
