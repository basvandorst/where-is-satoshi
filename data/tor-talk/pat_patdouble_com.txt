@_subject: Blocking child pornography exits 
I understand your concern. What needs to be understood is the separation of concerns principle. Let the Tor people make an anonymizing network. As has already been stated, there is an ExitPolicy feature that can be used to block sites. IIRC the squidGuard project maintains a blacklist of sites (including other kinds like software pirating, casinos, etc) that may be desired to be blocked. A sensible way to attack this may be to write a script that periodically downloads the blacklist and translates that into a set of ExitPolicy statements, then HUP tor to reload it.
What OS are you on? If a Un*x variant should might try tackling this, shell scripts are not that difficult.

Sorry for not doing research BEFORE I made the post, but...
Here is one such list:
For just the porn section you may have approx. 700,000 entries. I have no idea what Tor would do with 700,000 exit policies but certainly that would need to have been a design consideration.

I'm manually running rtorrent. There are two HTTP servers available though, you can get them via the link I sent in the original email. One is my server running at a commercial ISP, which I added recently when I found that my disk quota is high enough. Since the demand is low I should not exceed the bandwidth limit (10GB / month). Robert Hogan is kindly mirroring at AnonymityAnywhere.com, which has 30GB / month. That should be plenty, but I thought I'd keep the torrents going for those who'd rather use that. rtorrent is running off my cable connection, so I have to watch the bandwidth.

Great! Can I add to my download page?
Does Thunderbird allow configuring outgoing mail to use a specific sendmail location rather than SMTP ? I was going to create an SMTP relay to mixminion myself, but thought a script that clones sendmail but uses mixminion would be more efficient and easier to maintain. I did that for KMail, so the mixminion integration isn't KMail specific. If Thunderbird allows using sendmail directly I could pre-config that. I'm installing Thunderbird now but it will take a little bit since Gentoo is doing a source compile, so I can get a quicker answer from you :)

@_subject: LiveCD / USB for testing 
I have made a Live CD with the intent of anonymous Internet usage and am offering it for review. I am aware of AnonymousAnywhere.com and ROCKate and I hope we can build on each other's work.
I have documented the CD at  . Actually I have two CDs, a full version of approximately 328M and a "tiny" version of 67M. Download is via BitTorrent:
I don't have much upload bandwidth, so please seed if you can.
One major change I am considering is blocking all UDP packets. Currently this is not done, but I'd like the CD in it's final version to be confident in it's security. I'm also considering making this a boot time option.
A major feature of this CD is a script that will copy to a USB and make it bootable. You can then carry on a USB pendrive an anonymous install and on this media your home directory will be saved, so settings, history, etc. will persist across sessions.
Some time in the future I will provide my build root. The CD uses the Gentoo Catalyst tool so it can be built from scratch. No existing CD necessary. Although this process can take many hours.

For a non-exit node this will be OK. On this CD all DNS resolution is done through Tor, not UDP. If I did block UDP I would change the DNS resolution to use Tor's MAPADDRESS to give a fake address so the exit node ends up doing the resolution when the connection is made.
Should a Live CD provide exit node functionality? Currently my implementation rejects all exit requests.

Thanks for the comments. I've made some re-organization changes and more finishing touches (like better eye-candy), some related to your comments. I have a new page but the referenced CDs are not available yet.
See comments below:
I've made the SVN available via HTTP and linked the configuration descriptions to the appropriate files.
:) Surely! There are a couple of places that it is labeled "Tor Kit", a toolkit for Tor based anonymity. I finished this and replaced all references of torcd (and torusb) to "Tor Kit". I even branded the UI as such.
Change made.
Yeah, I should've done that. Since this is based on Gentoo, the versions are those deemed by Gentoo devs as "stable", with some rare exceptions including the main apps such as Tor, Privoxy, TorK, Vidalia, etc. I am thinking of addressing this way:
1. Generation of the CD puts a manifest of all packages and versions at /usr/share/packages.txt . This is complete and will be available when I post the next CDs (hopefully today or tomorrow).
2. Write a script to update the posted version of torkit.html with the version numbers of the apps that are referenced (not the entire set). I'll work on this after the CDs are posted.
It would be nice to update the torkit.html on the CD but due to the catalyst build tool there is not a convient way to do this. I may patch catalyst.
The version I'm working on now blocks UDP. I see no compelling reason yet to enable it. If there is an app that needs it I will open specific ports.
I am aiming towards people who know how to use the apps, know that anonymity is a concern, but aren't interested in tweaking the settings, network filter, etc. I reflected this in the updated torkit.html document.
Thanks for the comments and the software.

I'm not sure my goal of providing more than Firefox as a web browser is a good idea. It is known that Tor is not enough to make you anonymous, hence all these extensions that are installed in Firefox. The problem is that not all of the same features are available on Konqueror or links. I can't remove Konqueror since it also does file management, but I think links I should remove. And the desktop link to Konq may need to be removed as well.

Interesting. I know at least one person is using Incognito as an OR as-is. The tiny version is being used.
If someone would identify what software would be desired and how to configure it on the USB drive, I'd be willing to look into it. You'd need a web server, hopefully something smaller and simplier than apache, any other kind of server? Since you'd want the ability to edit the content on the USB drive, the config could be in a directory structure like "/hidden". The private key would need to be available, I would think in the home volume though since truecrypt can be used to encrypt it.
I can't say I'm motivated to create another variant of Incognito for server use for maintence reasons. The full version would definately have the functionality. Depending on the server software required (httpd, etc), it may fit on tiny, which is <50MB.
Anyone else interested? Someone who is running hidden services have ideas,

If phobos doesn't have a script I'll most likely write one. The problem would be that the 'easylist' also includes a whitelist at the end, I assume that all patterns are scanned from start to end and if something is blacklisted AND whitelisted, it is allowed. AFAIK Polipo only provides a blacklist.

I saw this and it is configured on Incognito to not do that. Also, doesn't matter if it honors the proxy settings as the kernel redirection will ensure all traffic goes through Tor.

What about censoring ETag, Last-Modified and If-Modified-Since ? Those are used to send info to the client that will be send back to the server, hence something can be encoded there to identify the machine. Keep in mind that there is no on-disk cache, so the live time of the ETag and Last-Modified data is "short", i.e. only during the user's session.

The versioning has changed from using the source code repository revision to the timestamp of the package snapshot and an increment number. The package snapshot means that the Gentoo package database was frozen on that date to build Incognito. These packages (with a few expections) remain the same through increments. Certain packages such as Tor, TorK, Vidalia, etc are updated for each increment number.
 Changes from r200 are:
    * Moved SVN to     * Changed versioning scheme to use snapshot date plus increment number.
    * New snapshot, various upgrades, such as KDE 3.5.7.
    * Tor 0.1.2.17

    * Added more network hardware support.
    * Added kmix for volume control.
