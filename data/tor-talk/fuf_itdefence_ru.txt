1) Are you talking about a system which allows investigators to prove
that they are looking for terrorist (and NOT human rights fighter)?
2) Or about a system which allows investigators to answer their
questions without shutting the Tor node down and confiscating the hardware?
Or something else?
In my country, law enforcement should obtain a warrant to break into my
house and confiscate the hardware (and they ALWAYS do so).
And it will take months or even years to give this hardware back...
So, I guess there's no extra need in such a system.
My point of view: if law enforcers need to trace some
super-puper-terrorist they can trace him in real life and use end-to-end
confirmation attacks to view his unencrypted traffic (I think pedophiles
can be traced in real life more efficiently too).

@_subject: Firefox sends your uptime 
Mozilla Firefox sends your computer's uptime while establishing TLS
(SSL) connection. This could be used to correlate anonymous traffic with
non-anonymous (e.g. LAN traffic) by correlating intercepted uptime
values (or to search the originator of anonymous traffic by correlating
uptime values from TCP timestamps in GNU/Linux and some other operating
Tested with latest Firefox versions (including Betas) on Windows. Should
also work on GNU/Linux too, but not works on my ArchLinux box due to
some patches...
RFCs 2246, 4346 describe following structure (part of TLS Client Hello
     struct {
         uint32 gmt_unix_time;
         opaque random_bytes[28];
      } Random;
Firefox sends your uptime in "gmt_unix_time" field (seconds since boot).
Other browsers (IE, Opera) send your current system time in UNIX format.
So, use your Firefox carefully ;)

Geoffrey Goodell ?????:
Yes, but running NTP syncs can transform this attack to "end-to-end
confirmation" attack. Attacker can modify NTP packets (they are being
sent over UDP) to hijack your current time (e.g. move it +12 seconds
forward) and then correlate HTTPS traffic from anonymous network (or
HTTP traffic from hidden service by looking at "Date:" field in HTTP

In this regard, yes. But, of course, I'm not saying "opera is better" ;)
Opera simply doesn't send your uptime in TLS Client Hello packet (as
well as IE).
No, it's not encrypted (you can check this in your favorite network
sniffer), so it can be fixed by Privoxy or similar app.
