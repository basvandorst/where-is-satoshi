@_subject: [tor-talk] New arm version doesn't show connections 
Today my Debian/stable box got a new arm version (tor-arm 1.4.2.4-1~bpo60+1 -> 1.4.4.1-1~squeeze).
But now the second page with the connections is empty while netstat is showing connections. I restarted tor and switched from control port to control socket, but nothing changes.
Does anyone have the some problem?
Shade and sweet water!

Hi Damian!
Well, I checked my aptitude log, and tor-arm was the only upgraded tor packaged. My tor version is 0.2.2.34 (recommended) (from the arm tool, Debian version 0.2.2.34-1~~squeeze+1).
The older version of arm was running as root, the new version is running as debian-tor user (I tried it as root user with the same symptoms).
Here are the log messages when I start arm as root (from today):
  09:02:43 [ARM_NOTICE] Unable to prepopulate bandwidth information (insufficient uptime)
  09:02:43 [ARM_NOTICE] Arm is currently running with root permissions. This is not a good idea, and will still work perfectly well if it's run with
    the same user as Tor (ie, starting with "sudo -u debian-tor arm").
  09:02:43 [ARM_NOTICE] No armrc loaded, using defaults. You can customize arm by placing a configuration file at '/root/.arm/armrc' (see the armrc.sa-
    mple for its options).

The system is a vServer (2.6.18-028stab093.2) with an uptime of 78 days, so the new kernel version.
See above. I am using "su -c arm debian-tor" for the new version.
The new version is using the control socket "/var/run/tor/control", but no change if I use the control port again.
Well, for the tests I have to activate the control port again. But the first test fails:

The resolver dump is working for proc, netstat and lsof (root and debian-tor). I had to run the script with LANG=C, or it would not work in my German locale. But running arm with LANG=C does not change the Shade and sweet water!

Hi Damian!
Thanks for your help!
It?s always nice to be able to reproduce a bug. ;-)
Well, the problem is, the option is not available, so I can?t use it.
Dec 15 18:31:59.385 [warn] Failed to parse/validate config: Unknown option ?DisableDebuggerAttachment?.  Failing.
Any other ideas?

The option is not available in Tor version 0.2.2.35 (installed today) as Shade and sweet water!

Well, it worked on my system with arm version 1.4.2.4, so I think that something must have changed in the code as well to trigger this bug. ;-)
At least my system didn?t change (no new kernel, no new libc).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Firefox, Adobe, and DRM 
It sounds scarier than it is. Mozilla will implement a sandbox in firefox for the Adobe DRM plugin to run in. This sandbox is completely open source. The DRM plugin is not part of firefox. You have to install it the same way you install the flash plugin.
So if you don?t want to use the DRM plugin, then don?t install it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Shutting down my tor relay 
The situation how the affair about Jake was handled by the Tor project has made me feel very uneasy.
After digging through several material (for example  I find that I am no longer believing in this project or trust it.
That’s why I’m shutting down my tor relay fsingtor now.
As long as the project stays that way it is I will no longer recommend Tor or support it in any ways. And I don’t think that such a project should have any future.
Good luck,

Excactly, and the project has lost this trust. Later it may win this trust back, but until then this is good bye.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor relay and IPv6 
I?m running a Tor relay (non-exit node, version 0.2.7.6). Since my system is having IPv6 connectivity I tried to activate IPv6 in Tor.
I changed the torrc and added the following lines (after some instructions found on the list):
ORPort [IPv6 IP]:9001
ExitPolicy reject6 *:*
ClientUseIPv6 1
?netstat -tanp6 | grep 9001? shows the open port but only one connection (IPv4 has much more). The program arm is only showing IPv4 connections.
The port 9030 is only bound to the IPv4 address but I think that is as it should be (configuration line is ?DirPort 9030?).
The IPv6 firewall is open for the ports 9001 and 9030.
Am I doing something wrong?

That was an indirect question of mine. ;-)
Yes, it is.
Then I will wait.
Thanks for your answers!
