I run Tor, Privoxy, and Firefox on DragonFly. I also run Konqueror on both DragonFly (KDE 4) and Ubuntu (KDE 3; I haven't updated it in too long). I leave Tor enabled in Firefox all the time, and the sites I need to bypass Tor for (Wiktionary, since I'm a Wiktionarian, localhost, and a few others) are listed in the Privoxy conf. Also localhost is exempt from Ubuntu's Konqueror, since if I ran it through Privoxy it would look at the DragonFly box, not the Ubuntu box. I've been annoyed several times by Tor coming up disabled and by tabs which I opened in Tor mode not coming up, when I thought I told it to bring them up.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor nymserver 
I've been thinking about a Tor nymserver. It would work like this: POP, IMAP, and SMTP ports are accessed through a hidden service. From the outside it looks like a normal mailserver; it sends and receives mail on port 25. The only way to send email out through it is to connect through the hidden service. If you connect to port 25 you have to authenticate to send mail. It also has a webserver, used to create accounts, which can be done only through the hidden service. At present, sending email through proxies is not universal, so the nymserver should also have a web interface for sending and receiving mail.
How does this compare with
*nymservers used with Cypherpunk and Mixmaster remailers?
*ordinary webmail used through Tor?

The way I did it, the hostname and private_key files are owned by tor with permissions 600, and are in /crypt/tor/chat/ which is also owned by tor with permissions 700. There's no need for the server to read those files or even be on the same computer as them. (/crypt is an encrypted partition.)
You need to set your hidden server to use a port other than 80, then redirect port 80 of the hidden service to the port the webserver is listening on.
HiddenServiceDir /crypt/tor/website1
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:99
HiddenServiceDir /crypt/tor/website2

Currently Tor traffic is sent in packets of 512 bytes (which "setevents bw" shows as 586), which makes it easy to recognize even though it's all TLS encrypted. I propose implementing the following on each connection from one Tor node to another:
1. Allocate a 2048-byte buffer.
2. When the relay has a packet to send, it puts it in the buffer, then picks a random number from 1 to the number of bytes in the buffer or 1426, whichever is less, and sends out that many bytes.
3. If the number of bytes remaining in the buffer is more than 1536, repeat step 2.
4. If no packet is ready to go out for a second, send out whatever is in the 1536=2048-512; 1426=1500+512-586.

*Mallory breaks an identity key. He can then pretend to be that relay. Directory servers will notice that two relays are claiming the same identity.
*The NSA runs a Tor relay called Eve. Eve passes all connection data to the NSA. Unless Eve gets picked to be a guard, is an exit, or both, she'll get only middleman data, which won't be much use. This attack has nothing to do with key size.
*The NSA installs Eves at various ISPs that host or pass data for relays. Alice and Bob are talking on Torchat. If Bob runs a relay, a timing attack is impossible unless one of them sends a file, as the data Bob relays will swamp the tiny amount of data they send by Torchat.
