@_subject: [tor-talk] Craigslist now blocking all Tor IPs? bad people use 
I know from reading this list that Tor project people sometimes contact
sites who block Tor and ask them to solve their issues some other way
but I have the distinct impression that they will not do so unless the
site in question is a government propaganda operation like Wikipedia or
YouTube and similar.
The real issue here is that bad people do use Tor. One or a few people
using it can cause real harm and more importantly cost. One of my own
sites receive about 10k abusive http POST requests per day from the Tor
network. I fully understand why many people do not want this cost when
there is no obvious benefit. The few legitimate Tor users that may want
to visit your site tend to block advertisements anyway. Thus, blocking
Tor can easily be seen as something that can reduce costs increase
shareholder value.
If you want those who block Tor to stop doing so then your best course
of action is probably to contact them yourself and help them implement
better solutions that prevent abuse from both Tor and non-Tor users. Do
not expect anyone to do this for you. There are ways to deal with abuse
from the Tor network without blocking it but implementing these
solutions does cost time and money. If you can present a solution with
little or no cost or convince them why they should accept a reduced
bottom line just to please the two Tor users who are not abusive then
just do it. If you can't then you should just accept that it is, in
many cases, just not worth the cost and trouble.

Yes. Selling advertisements do increase shareholder value. Accepting

This is true and a very good point. Spammers gonna spam and it does not
make a big difference if they use Tor or a botnet. Many sites therefore
deal with these in the same way, they grab a big list and block them.
There are, as I said, better ways to deal with this. The trick is to
make it costly (require some form of human labor/interaction) to make
an account yet cheap enough so that legitimate actual people do create

I am a long-time Tor user, I run tor relays and I'm all for Tor.
I am also a capitalist and owner of quite a few websites. And I block

One Tor user with too much time on his hands can ruin it for everyone.
I fully understand why some sites block POST requests from Tor. Now,
why some sites block GET requests from Tor is another matter, that I
have problems understanding. "You're using Tor so you can't read what's

fully understand. "Bad people" use Tor and some of them have too much
time on their hands. Every minute I have to spend on one of those is
one I can't spend on _profitable_ users.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Operation Onymous against hidden services, 
The location hidden services are just ONE of the features Tor provides.
The Tor developers themselves ADMIT that this specific feature is not
particularly secure:
"The long-term keypair of a Hidden Service is an RSA-1024 keypair which
nowadays is considered weak."[1]
I for one think it is PERFECTLY reasonable to question the security of
this particular feature. Just the amount of sites that went down on the
same day should be reason enough to ask some hard questions regarding
the (lack of) security hidden services provide. If the FBI had shut down ONE website then you could explain that away.
Indeed SR2 can be explained with the simple fact that it was a honeypot
from the beginning: They brag about how a Homeland Security person was
involved since BEFORE that site was launched. It is very interesting that absolutely NO information regarding all the
other sites that went down today has been put forward. Could this be
because they do not have any plausible explanation as to how these
sites were found and taken down?
One thing is clear regardless of what happened to these sites: Those
hidden services "need some love" as the Tor people themselves admit.
And I personally recommend not using them until they do.
Are there any huge BTC wallets that can be seized by doing so?

To those who want to pretend otherwise: The first step to fixing a
problem is to admit that it exists. There is no point in pretending
these .onion sites are secure anymore. The only interesting question
now is: How can this be fixed?
They could simply look for high amounts of Tor traffic and pull the
plug in IPs whos traffic pattern look like it may be a hidden service
and see if anything goes down.
Regardless of how it is actually done: It seems perfectly clear that
they are able to identify the servers hosting hidden services. Those

We can not really know exactly how they did it but one thing is
From doxbin and others we know that they in many cases just grabbed the
servers and closed the hidden services without arresting those behind
them. It appears this depends on what OPSEC they were using.
This is interesting because it makes it very clear that they are
finding and taking down the hidden services first and then they look at
the hardware they stole and the server bills and so on and try to figure
out who was behind them.
From what I have read the last few days there is absolutely no doubt in
my mind that they can in fact find the physical location of Tor hidden
services and that they do this first and try to find out who is behind
them later. It also seems clear that some parts of organized crime
networks like the FBI and Europol want to prevent otherwise because
their capability of finding hidden services makes future arrests so
As for those hidden services that was not taken down: My guess is that
they are either hosted outside the United States of Fascism and the
Fascist Union or honeypots.

As I said in another message here: Look at the doxbin tweets and other
information that has been put forth after this round of raids. They
have indeed taken down quite a few hidden services without figuring out
who was behind them. This also shines through from what representatives
from the organized crime networks like Europol and FBI have publicly
It is perfectly clear that they can and do locate the Tor hidden
services and that they in many cases took them down without having
any idea who was behind them. Those with good opsec and no real world links to act on were indeed
left alone and some of them are actively telling the world about this
through tweets and forum posts.
It also seems quite clear that Europol in many cases had no information
at all beyond being told by the FBI what boxes to steal. The simple
fact that they took down a lot more services than they arrested people
is somewhat telling. I am guessing that they will now look at the
hardware they stole for clues about who ran the services and we will
probably see a few more arrests in the coming days. Those with good
opsec will likely see no real world consequences at all.

I am personally NOT convinced Tor handles this kind of surveillance at
all but it depends on the threat model.
This is mine:
All (border-crossing) digital communications are by law required to be
routed through the FRA corporation[1]. This is done by my ISP and all
local ISPs because they are required to do so by law.
This means that FRA is able to monitor all end-users and all websites
and Internet services hosted within the Iron Curtain.
Is it possible that they could see that this particular pile of data
went out from webservice X and a similar pile of traffic went to
customer X? There is no way to know for sure.
You should assume that they are monitoring all ExitNodes. The local
situation is that they do not need to monitor ExitNode because they get
to see everything going from out from an ExitNode and into this country
Using Tor makes it slightly harder for them and that is a good thing.
Just don't blindly assume they can not at minimum see parts of your
traffic because that is likely wrong.
One last little detail: I am talking about legal, mandated
surveillance. What is and is not legal in your country may also change.
I personally stopped caring about what is and is not legal a long time
ago, the local regime does not care at all. The only thing that does
matter is that you do not irritate anyone to the point where they
decide to take action against you.

?Bitcoin is a decentralized P2P digital currency in which coins are
generated by a distributed set of miners and transaction are
broadcasted via a peer-to-peer network. While Bitcoin provides some
level of anonymity (or rather pseudonymity) by encouraging the users to
have any number of random-looking Bitcoin addresses, recent research
shows that this level of anonymity is rather low. This encourages users
to connect to the Bitcoin network through anonymizers like Tor and
motivates development of default Tor functionality for popular mobile
SPV clients. In this paper we show that combining Tor and Bitcoin
creates an attack vector for the deterministic and stealthy
man-in-the-middle attacks. A low-resource attacker can gain full
control of information flows between all users who chose to use Bitcoin
over Tor. In particular the attacker can link together user?s
transactions regardless of pseudonyms used, control which Bitcoin
blocks and transactions are relayed to the user and can delay or
discard user?s transactions and blocks. In collusion with a powerful
miner double-spending attacks become possible and a totally virtual
Bitcoin reality can be created for such set of users."

"Combining it with some peculiarities of how Tor handles data streams a

@_subject: [tor-talk] Comcast looking for Tor traffic, 
You sound like a troll but I'll feed you with something to think about
on the off-chance that you are actually serious.
a) Can you opt-out of Facebook, GMail and Yahoo?
b) Do you yourself have to take any active action to get on Facebook,
GMail and Yahoo?
c) Can you opt-out of PinkMeth?
There really is a huge difference. I do not have a Facebook account and
I only use GMail to ask idiots who send me e-mail from Hotmail for an
alternative address (since Hotmail has blocked my mailserver since
forever). This is my choice. I can not prevent people I know from
posting pictures of me on Facebook but if someone does that then it
will likely be posted under their real name and I can ask them to
remove it.
I would have to register a Facebook account to get on there, and that
would be my choice. If I post a picture of my ex-gf on PinkMeth then
that is NOT her choice and it is not that easy for her to remove it (or
even find out about it). There is a big difference between sites abusing the data you give them
if you are stupid enough to give them any and sites where other people
post your data without your knowledge or concent.

@_subject: [tor-talk] more sites requiring captchas from Cloudfare (using 
I too have noticed the Cloudflare annoyance on a wide variety of sites
lately (not sure if more sites use Cloudflare or if Cloudfare has begun
asking for a captcha in more cases).
The only solution would be to ask/get Cloudflare to stop doing this so
we will probably just have to live with it. Perhaps someone from the
Tor project could talk to them - but it could be that they have
experienced a lot of abuse and have their reasons (still, you get this
captcha when trying to get to the site, it's not something that only
shows up if you do a HTTP POST or something like that).
I just want to say this to webmasters and website owners: What actually
happens is that I click a link, see the Cloudflare "captcha" message,
interpret the message as "This site is broken when accessed through
Tor, oh well" and CLOSE THE TAB or click "Back".
I am not sure this is something most corporations would care about
since Tor users tend to block their (javascript-using) advertisements
anyway but webmasters, know that I am probably not the only one who
will go somewhere else instead of enabling JavaScript from a bunch
of places & typing in a silly captcha

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor relay on home computer 
Hash: SHA1
There is no big public list of bridges. They would have to look very
closely at you and your internet connection to find out that you are
running a bridge and if they are doing that then you have bigger
problems anyway.
Running a bridge on your home computer is totally safe and a great way
to help out. You should really do this.
Regarding your "Tor relay" question, it is like Moritz said: You can
run a Tor relay for years and years without any hint of
trouble AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO EXIT. It is when you
allow people to _exit_ to the Internets the trouble starts because
people will send DMCA spam and other spam to your Internet Service
Provider because of your Tor exit node and this is where it gets very
risky. If you know what kind of moral values your ISP has then you can
likely guess how this will go down with them. Some view DMCA spam
e-mails as just that and others have a "6 strike system" where they
will just shut down your internets after 6 spam.
In short, just run a bridge and you'll do great or run a normal Tor
relay that does not allow exiting if your home connection is kind of
fast. Don't bother and just run a bridge if it is on ADSL or something
like that.

It sounds like they are cracking down on anonymity. I advise you to get
out now because it will only get much, much worse[1].
It would be really interesting if you could ask your friend to describe
the details regarding his Internet connection. What type is it
(fiber/adsl/cable), what kind of router is he using and does this also
happen if he uses another compatible third-party modem/router? And if
he is willing to experiment then it would be great if he could figure
out more details on exactly how they are doing this. This does sound like some kind of traffic analysis which just breaks it
if it matches Tor? On a happy note, I am glad to hear that pluggable
transports work and allow people in suppressive fascist regimes like
the US to use Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Yelp blocking Tor users from viewing entire site 
This is clearly not why they are blocking Tor. Yelp has decided that
you can't read their website anonymously. If they were blocking http(s)
POST requests then that would be another story. As someone who has a
bunch of websites myself I do have some understanding as to why someone
would block http(s) POST but simply denying people access to read your
website anonymously is going way further.
This could be a reason but if they can not locate where the websites
visitor is coming from then they could simply not count it.
Regardless of why, I've put *.yelp.com/.* in the blacklist for the YaCy
P2P clearnet search node at  so I won't
be clicking any links there by accident anyway. (on that topic, if
someone has a big list of every site out there which uses Cloudflare to

You will have a really hard time taking legal action in a whole lot of
cases, specially those who involve https MITM attacks. If your ISP is
doing a MITM attack on every outgoing connection because their loving
government requires them to do so then good luck with your legal
action. I expect we will see a lot more upstream interference of that
sort in the future. The way western media blames encryption for this
weekends false-flag NATO operation in France is a good indicator.

IBMs history of providing hardware and support to various regimes who
do things that may be morally questionable is long and well documented.
There were, for example, these guys they worked closely with in Germany
in the 1930s and 1940s who did some slightly disturbing things using IBM
technology. See  for some details.
It is not, given their history, shocking to read that IBM is against
software such as Tor.

Are those actually relay users? It doesn't look that way. That
hockey-stick graph simply does not look like organic growth. There's 82 million people in Iran which means that one in a hundred
people is now using Tor in Iran - according to that chart. That's
highly unlikely unless the state media announced explicitly told people
to use Tor time and time again. It seems much more likely that there is
something else going on.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How long does it take for websites to discover new 
"A single abuse event" isn't it. At all. I've been running Tor nodes
for decades and I support it for various reasons but I also run quite a
few websites and I totally and fully understand Why someone would just
want to not deal with the Constant Bombardment of Abuse that is coming
from the Tor network.
It's not some guy using Tor posing some abusive comment that's causing
website owners to just block tor; it's a Constant Stream of Bots doing
POST requests & looking for exploits. It's not something you see once
or twice every now and then, it's 20+ requests per hour for things like
wp-login.php, wp-comments.php, manager/FCKeditor/fckconfig.js,
utility/convert/data/config.inc.php, /db.sql, /backupsite.sql and a
whole lot of other files used that don't exist which may be used by some
exploitable CMS system. A lot of the abusive bots coming from Tor are
just stupid, they don't care if you're using WordPress or not, they
will just constantly send POST requests anyway.
This is obviously not just a Tor exit node problem. And it's possible
to deal with it in better ways than using a Tor exit node blacklist.
However, I do understand why someone would just say "I'll just ban that
Tor thing, from my perspective it's one big abusive botnet" - that's
essentially what it is from a pure web hosting providers perspective.
That's probably what I'd do if I weren't familiar with Tor.

What, if anything, would I need in a torrc to only get US (or non-EU)

A very large amount of US media sites show a "This site is unavailable

exit node is used and I get that a lot.
This isn't done to break Tor, obviously. Why so many US based media
companies are intentionally breaking their sites if a EU based IP is
used is obviously a good question.
