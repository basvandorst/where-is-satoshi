"Recent CPUs from Intel requires a binary called the “Management Engine”

disabled ME [..]"
That said, I hope (and expect) they will bring out a laptop based on any
of the i.MX 8M cpu's they also use in their Librem 5.
I have no experience with their laptops (but have ordered the Librem 5).

I am very exicted about the upcoming Librem 5 for several reasons:
o Purism has a proven track record with both hardware (their laptops)
  and software.
o The NXP i.MX 8M family of cpu's is apparently relatively open.
o The expected hardware is powerfull: four core cpu, at least 3GB
  of memory, 32GB storage, 5.5" 720×1440 display:
  And on a more personal note:
o I'm quite done with Google and their hunger for information.
o My Android phone is eol software wise (4,4.2), (but not hardware,
  which makes me sad from an environmental perspective).
o I've owned an Openmoko GTA02 years ago so I already know this will not
  be a smooth ride.
It seems the timing for a new Linux phone is spot on.
FTR: I've ordered a Librem 5.
