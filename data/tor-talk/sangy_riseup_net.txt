Please don't. You are introducing a man in the middle between yourself
and the banks...

Yes, they *should*. It's not like it hasn't happened before[1]. You are
also assuming they have HSTS properly enabled and/or their SSL setup is
properly configured[2]. The danger here is to assume things are safe on
their end.
What is the benefit of doing banking through tor? [1] [2]

I feel you, Druida.
Sadly, the EFF is now full of w****s and sillicon-valley technocrats
that can't see beyond California. I find it chuckle-worthy that every
single one of the authors pleading for moving past pgp only list their
pgp keys in the staff pages[1][2][3]*. On the signal side, it only takes
less access than the EFail attack and an IMSI catcher for the govt to
whack you, physically.
Stay safe.
* And all encoded differently, oh my! Imagine, they still think that gpg
  defaults to SHA1 for signing. [1] [2] [3]
