@_subject: Setting Up Server Help Please. 
i'd like to help by running a server but for some reason something
isn't taking properly.  i followed the instructions step by step a few
times.  i load the directory manually and i don't seem to find my
nickname.  i'm running a ubuntu breezy distro.  maybe this will help.
i'm including both my torrc file, and the log file, any help would be
really appreciated.
 NOTE: If you enable these, you should consider mailing your identity
 key fingerprint to the tor-ops, so we can add you to the list of
 servers that clients will trust. See
  for details.
 Required: A unique handle for this server
Nickname ephman
 The IP or fqdn for this server. Leave commented out and Tor will guess.
Address ephman.no-ip.info
 Contact info that will be published in the directory, so we can
 contact you if you need to upgrade or if something goes wrong.
 This is optional but recommended.
 Random Person  You might also include your PGP or GPG fingerprint if you have one:
 1234D/FFFFFFFF Random Person  Required: what port to advertise for tor connections
ORPort 9001
 If you want to listen on a port other than the one advertised
 in ORPort (e.g. to advertise 443 but bind to 9090), uncomment
 the line below. You'll need to do ipchains or other port forwarding
 yourself to make this work.
 0.0.0.0:9090
 Uncomment this to mirror the directory for others (please do)
DirPort 9030 # what port to advertise for directory connections
 If you want to listen on a port other than the one advertised
 in DirPort (e.g. to advertise 80 but bind 9091), uncomment the line
 below. You'll need to do ipchains or other port forwarding yourself
 to make this work.
 0.0.0.0:9091
 A comma-separated list of exit policies. They're considered first
 to last, and the first match wins. If you want to *replace*
 the default exit policy, end this with either a reject *:* or an
 accept *:*. Otherwise, you're *augmenting* (prepending to) the
 default exit policy. Leave commented to just use the default, which is
 available in the man page or at  Look at  for issues you might encounter if you use the default exit policy.
 If certain IPs and ports are blocked externally, e.g. by your firewall,
 you should update your exit policy to reflect this -- otherwise Tor
 users will be told that those destinations are down.
 accept *:6660-6667,reject *:* # allow irc ports but no more
 accept *:119 # accept nntp as well as default exit policy
ExitPolicy reject *:* # middleman only -- no exits allowed

@_subject: Traffic Observation I'm Curious About 
ok so i got the server up and running (i think).  i've set it as a
middleman.  now what i'm seeing is that there is way more outgoing
traffic then incoming.  infact i actually get very little incoming
traffic.  shouldn't what comes in, go out?
thanks for the bandwith,
