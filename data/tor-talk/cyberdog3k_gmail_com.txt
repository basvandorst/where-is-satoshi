@_subject: Tor 0.2.0.32 is released 
Are there any bugs open with Debian/Ubuntu to get these merged into
the security branches?  I haven't checked Debian, but Ubuntu 8.10 is
currently still at 0.31.

@_subject: Your Tor relay might be affected by Debain OpenSSL flaw 
I received a notice earlier today stating that "Your Tor relay might
be affected by Debain OpenSSL flaw."  I had already regenerated my
secret keys following the procedure given in the tor-announce notice
(after having updated ssl/ssh/etc).  Regardless, my node still appears
blacklisted.  Is this list static?  The notice unfortunately did not
seem to document the re-enabling procedure for corrected nodes.

I'm no Tor expert, but based on the announcement I:
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade   [ssl is now ubuntu hardy latest]
rm /var/lib/tor/keys/secret_*
My server log then gives me:
May 14 09:01:30.488 [warn] Received http status code 404 ("Not found")
from server '...' while fetching "/tor/status/fp/...". I'll try again
Which I assume is because I'm still blocked.  Am I missing a step in
the procedure, or misinterpreting the log?

@_subject: Any plans to fix tor for OpenDNS? 
The very nature of OpenDNS conflicts with the concept of anonymity and
privacy.  By using the service, you're not only giving them the
opportunity to track your requests, you're also allowing them to
redirect your lookups to third parties at will.
While I don't speak for the Tor developers, I see no reason such a
warning should go away.  Anyone using OpenDNS should be made aware of
these risks, and that easily goes doubly so for anyone actually
attempting to anonymize their activity.

It depends on your configuration and the scale of your network.  I run
them on both my home network and my vps with no issue.  On my home
network I run Bind (because I also use dhcp updates to serve a couple
zones).  It's trivial to configure for caching lookup.  It's a bit
heavy on resources (comparatively), but is very powerful, and on a
small network will run fine on any old hardware.
On my vps, where memory is precious, I run pdns_recursor.  It's
exceptionally light on resources and still performs very well as a
caching resolver.  There's almost no configuration required.

@_subject: DDoS attacks via TOR? 
I'm not entirely sure the Tor network has the bandwidth to effectively
DoS a target.  I think someone attempting such would be equally likely
to DoS the Tor network itself in the process.  See also the Bittorrent
Disclaimer:  I'm not a Tor insider and am basing these claims purely
on my own observations.

@_subject: Kudos on memory usage in 0.2.X 
I've been running a Tor node on my personal VPS for several months as
a way to "give back" to the community with some of my unused
bandwidth.  My one gripe was that the Tor daemon in 0.1.X sucked a lot
of my very limited memory allocation, even when not accepting exits.
Having recently upgraded to 0.2.X due to its inclusion in Intrepid,
I've seen a *drastic* improvement in memory efficiency.  The new
version appears magnitudes lighter on resources using the same
configuration.  This is a big deal to me, and I just wanted to give
thanks to the developers for focusing on performance as well as
functionality.  Keep up the good work!

@_subject: How to ban many IPs? 
Personally, I run my tor node as transport only (non-exit).  I can't
risk opening myself up to illegal activities by running an exit node,
but I figure the least I can do is provide decent transport as the
middle-man, and let the people running exit nodes concern themselves
with the legality of the activity.

@_subject: Tor 0.2.0.31-1 in Ubuntu Intrepid Beta - Please Test! 
As of a couple days ago, Ubuntu bug [ was resolved, adding Tor
version 0.2.0.31-1 to the latest beta release of Intrepid Ibex.  As
this is the first 0.2.x deb to be included in Ubuntu, it would be very
helpful to get testers before the release goes final.  Feedback on
fresh installs, as well as upgrades from previous releases, is greatly
appreciated!  If you find any bugs relating to the deb (versus Tor
itself), please report them via the Ubuntu bug tracker.
