To be honest, they can most probably use the "or allow for abuse"
clause to ban an exit node. This covers a lot of things. Running an
improperly configured email server, an unpatched old web server etc.

@_subject: webdav as hidden service? 
Yes, people have tried, there are working webdav stores out in onionland.
For linux you can use the davfs2 filesystem. It can be used through a
proxy, and work with Tor. It was very slow when I tried it though,
slower than usable because proxies, tunnels and sockets keep timing
out, so the filesystem just locks up and you have no idea what happens
because you don't get any feedback.
You cold use the filesystem-way to upload, and then use for example
wget for retrieving.
I think I also tried fusedav. Can't remember why I didn't continue
with that, might have been too unmaintained or broken.

@_subject: New GETINFO option, "bytes" 
Hi. I added a new option for GETINFO, that will return the total
number of bytes that's gone through Tor since process startup. Just
exporting the internal stats_n_bytes_read/written.
This is very useful for retrieving statistics like bandwidth over
time, for use with tools like arm, vidalia, munin, and other
monitoring applications. The current method that use events is
difficult to use, since you have to listen all the time. With the new
method you can for example poll every minute to see how many bytes was
transferred in total since last you checked.
I wrote a plugin for munin that use this new feature, and it works great.
The patch is trivial, and you probably want to change the name of the
command if you want to use it. There might also be reasons that you
don't want to export and print uint64_t variables. I didn't take time
to check any tor internals guidelines.

Qualified guess: These might be so-called BitTorrent trackers.
These tracker URLs are embedded in torrent files that you download.
You can download these torrent files from various sources, not
necessarily (even rarely) from the site itself. When you load these
torrents into a BitTorrent client, the client tries to contact all the
trackers embedded in the file, and will probably try every 5 minutes
or so. Smarter clients would give up or use incremental/exponential
back-off, but there are probably enough dumb clients out there to
The sad thing is that people try to use Tor for BitTorrent, though of
course there might be a use for BitTorrent on Tor so I hope it's not
just for sharing the random average movies and music.

I consider myself a rather technical user with a lot of knowledge

I'm scared shit whenever I want to use torbutton in firefox because
I'm afraid I will forget to toggle it, or toggle it at the wrong time,

with torbutton always on, and one profile without it, and separating
these is the only sane way.
Thus, I can only agree to 100% that this is a good idea.
The only problem I can come up with at 2 AM is that maintaining a
separate firefox can be a little messy in various linux distributions
unless you happen to have someone build a nice binary for you. I
suppose most of the common distributions will be covered with a
tor-repository and the minor distributions will generally have more
knowledgable users so they can take care of the evenutal mess.

I think that it's more curious that someone used Tor and didn't know

But to be honest, if you don't know anything about programming it
doesn't matter that the source code is available, how are you supposed

you? And there's no way to know how many independent programmers have
validated the source code. In a scenario where the military actually
would hide something in the source, all programmers working on the

of them.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Iran cracks down on web dissident technology 
What they have gained with the Tor project, and I'm just brainstorming
here because I'm from Sweden and don't know much about the internals
of DoD, is this:
They need a project like Tor as much as "we" do, if not more. They
need ways to communicate with spies and dissidents located all over
the world, they need a system that let their people do this without
causing any suspicion.
With Tor, they have such a tool, and the openess of the software and
source code means that it's more thoroughly tested than they could
ever have done in secret. It is likely that they have a highly
modified version of Tor and that they are watching the Tor project
very carefully as a research project to see the strengths and
weaknesses with such a project.
Planting backdoors in software like this is pretty useless and
ineffective, because you can only use it once. As soon as you act on
information received, there is a very big chance that the backdoor
will be uncovered, Tor will lose all credibility, and no one will ever
again use it for anything that the US would seem interesting.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Problem with TransPort etc. 
I am trying to route all traffic from one specific user on one machine on
my LAN through Tor, but I am having difficulties. There is probably
something I have neglected to configure.
What is special with my setup is that I run Tor on one of my servers
(debian). I would like to keep doing this. I am aware that my traffic is
flowing in cleartext over my LAN.
On this server, Tor is running fine, with the following in torrc:
TransPort 10.x.x.x:19050
DNSPort 10.x.x.x:19053
VirtualAddrNetwork 10.192.0.0/10
10.x.x.x is that server's address on the LAN. 'netstat' shows that Tor is
listening on these ports.
On my client machine, I have created a user called 'torvm'. I have added
these two iptables rules:
# iptables -A OUTPUT -t nat -p tcp -m owner ?-uid-owner torvm -j DNAT --to
# iptables -A OUTPUT -t nat -p udp --dport 53 -mowner --uid-owner torvm -j
DNAT --to 10.x.x.x:19053
The client is running Ubuntu. I doubt this is relevant at the moment.
Now I test this setup on my client:
$ w3m -dump_head What happens is this:
1. The client sends the packets to the server on the correct address and
port. This can be seen from a tcpdump trace [1].
2. I do not get any output from my test command on the client. Without the
iptables rules, I do get the expected output.
3. The Tor log shows a warning message: "getsockopt() failed: Protocol not
I don't know if this is the root of the problem. Googling for this in
relation to Tor does not show anything that seemed relevant.
Nothing relevant shows up in syslog that is not also in Tor's log.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Running an exit node which exits on a different IP than 
I have been sorting through my mailbox the last few days and stumbled
upon an email from 2012, from this mailing list. A worried user got a
false negative from check.torproject.org because an exit relay sent
exit traffic out on an IP that's different from what was advertised.
However, this made me think that it is perhaps not such a bad idea if
more exit relays did that, even slower ones. I have access to a couple
of IP numbers that I could easily configure in this way.
Basically: Use one IP for Tor traffic, and one IP for exit traffic.
The Tor traffic IP:Port is what would be advertised to the Tor
network, and only that.
The reason would be to minimize the chances of the exit IP ending up
in some overzealous blacklist. I'm pretty sure that a lot of the
blacklist operators just scrape the public list of relays and then
they end up in a lot of places where the customer is not even aware
what is being blocked. This is painfully obvious to people running a
non-exit relay from home, when trying to use IRC or other services.
Is this a good idea to do if you have the resources? Will it cause any
non-obvious problems? I guess one problem is that check.torproject.org

2012 to check this in another way.

if this is the case.

@_subject: [tor-talk] ICANN and .onion 
A few years ago, ICANN started to accept suggestions for new top-level
domain names. A friend recently posted a .onion link to me, and it made me
realize that there might be a big problem if a company or organization
other than Tor actually registered .onion and made it work in any browser.
1) Has there been any discussions regarding the severity of the problem if
it should eventually happen? If so, are the discussions or the result of
them available online for reading?
2) Has Tor applied to ICANN about the .onion domain, or discussed the pro
and con of doing this?
I have been out of the Tor loop for a couple of years, so I'm sorry if this
topic has come up in previous discussions - regardless, I could not find an

I think that's a rather arrogant point of view. If it was not a Tor
problem, .onion would not be needed in the first place. Tor developers do
seem to work hard on making it difficult for a user to accidentally leak
information, so simply saying that users "failing to redirect dns into tor
is not a tor problem" is a little counterproductive.
If someone would register .onion I see two problems:
1) A malevolent registrar could redirect all .onion lookups to their own
proxy, essentially routing all "hidden" traffic through their own machine.
At the moment, clicking a .onion link means that it either routes through
Tor, or it fails loudly: there's no risk clicking such a link. This
behaviour would change to something that either routes through Tor and
you're safe, or you think it routes through Tor but it's actually decoded
by a third part. I think that's a usability issue, and not something that
should simply be ignored. Maybe it's not something that can easily be
solved, but that is why there must be a discussion about it. Maybe the only
solution is to strongly warn users.
2) Useful websites could actually pop up under .onion, making a plugin that
takes over that domain seem intrusive and less attractive. This is less of
a problem I think.

So basically they see that someone signs up using the VPS that you've
paid for using your real name and account? Why do you even use Tor to
connect to the VPS? If they want to know who's behind the account
they'll just send a threatening enough letter to the VPS owner.

All of this boils down to a single point of failure: You have to trust
your VPS. "Has no logs" - you don't know that. "Burn your VPS IP" -
All IP<->VPS history might be logged. "Spin up new ones" - from the
outside this is exactly like changing the IP, you have to trust that
the VPS provider does not keep the logs.
However, if you do manage to get an anonymous VPS, I agree that it is
beneficial to only connect to it through Tor if you want it to remain

I'm sorry, but it's difficult to take you seriously. If you actually
want anyone to take your words seriously and in the long run effect a
change, you need to start working on your debating skills. Find
sources that backs up your standpoints. Don't go into needless rants.
Those sorts of things.
On the other hand, if you want to look like a screaming child with no
other agenda than wanting to be at the center of attention, you're
doing a good job.

This is something worth pointing out. How does the current

If you always show up as "unique", even when returning, it means that
you are not really that unique or identifiable after all. This also
applies if you end up in small groups.

Since my ISP implements carrier-grade NAT[1] (with an opt-out system)
I read a little about it and found something called the "Port Control
Protocol"[2] (PCP). Unless I am mistaken, and *if* my ISP implements
it, it seems that it could enable me to run a Tor relay on one of the
shared IP numbers.
message to my ISPs router saying something like "I want an external
port bound to this ip:port on my network", and it would either assign
a port on the external IP and return it to me, or deny the request. If
accepted, I could have my Tor announce that external ip:port and
everything should work as expected.
Now, before I dig in to this, I wonder if someone else has experience
with it? Any flaws with this hypothetical setup?

Thanks for these links!
Amazing how much better the initial v1 site looks compared to the
later versions. Web 2.0 and 3.0 was really a step back in usability
from the actual *WEB* of hyperlinks.
Today every website looks like an advertisement meant to be viewed in
the couch on your iPad, carefully planned so that you have to scroll
through the content. Gotta get those "user engagement" advertisement
revenue statistics. Too bad it has spread to a lot of open source
projects. I have a difficult time trusting the sincerity of a project
that needs to overwhelm me with catchy slogans the first thing they
do, without even linking to the details.
