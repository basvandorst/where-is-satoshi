Hello !
Yes, since few days, I notice that Amazon ask me for a CAPTCHA code.

entirely completed over Tor, or only partially - the "over 200 proxy
servers" sounds like come other proxy network - but it's a fine example of
the sort of thing I have been talking about and what all those CAPTCHAs we
experience are meant to be preventing, in this case: helping scammy hoaxy

@_subject: [tor-talk] Wily repository 
Hello every one !
I'm new around here and i don't know if i'm on the right list for posting my question.
Some month ago, i have installed tor on Ubuntu Wily with the methode described here :
It's works fine but since a few weeks, every update attempt on the repository return a 404. And indeed, if i check the repository i only find Xenial repository
So, i'm wondering if it's normal or not, cause i tried to search some news about this, but i didn't find anything
Thank you
