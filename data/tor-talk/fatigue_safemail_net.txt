@_subject: [tor-talk] Strange TOR connection behavior? EntryNodes/Strict 
I'm a little new to TOR. I run it in linux and start and stop it from a terminal window. I have changed my torrc to include the following:
EntryNodes poohbear
where 'poohbear' is the entry node I wish to use.
This setup works, however when I monitor the traffic with wireshark, I see that tor is making many https connections to other tor nodes prior to establishing a secure connection with the poohbear node.
Why is this the case? Shouldn't the EntryNodes operator limit connections to the poobear node, and only the poohbear node?
