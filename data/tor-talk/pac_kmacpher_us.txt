Roger seems so upset about Tor's connection with the pentagon that
perhaps it would be better for all concerned if his vitriol was directed elsewhere, forcebly if necessary.  He is adding nothing to the

Oops.  I apologize to all for my blunder.  Ben, thank you for pointing this out to me.  Sometimes I think I am a walking example of a little knowledge being a dangerous thing.

I sent (or think I sent) this message a few weeks ago, but received no

Perhaps I've missed something, but does this have anything to do whatsoever with TOR?

Twice this week while viewing things using Firefox under TOR, my system
has locked up.  And when I say locked up, I mean red-paddle locked up.
After restarting all was back to normal.  I am running version 5.5.5
of TOR on a 64-bit Intel archicture PC under Windoze 8.1.  One site belonged to a regional government so I wouldn't expect them
to be sending me malware.
Anyone else finding this?  I have used TOR almost daily for several
years without this happening.

You are right, of course.  I don't know that Tor is the problem.  It's
just that my system locked up only while using TOR and nowhere else.
Certainly not proof, but at least worth a cursory investigation.  Thank you for reminding me about the system logs.
