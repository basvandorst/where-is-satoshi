@_subject: [tor-talk] hidden service documentation 
Is there some comprehensive documentation for running a hidden service? I was thinking it was just for a few people who had experience with that for some reason.

@_subject: [tor-talk] [Fwd: help setting up access points] 
Hello, I'm looking to use tor to create public access points
 (wifi/ethernet/bluetooth/usb/4G/etc.)
 Is there any combined documentation on the methods available and
 walkthrough tutorials?
 Something that allows account management and metering for
 connections and landing page that I can display my own info and login's
 for new connections and even a piratebox style chat system for local users
 to communicate would be nice, or an irc integration page (oftc?) where
 users of the AP can easily chat would be nice.
 I could pay $100-1000 in bitcoins for help in getting some good methods
 for doing this, of course the connecting devices could run relays and help
 the tor network also.

Is there a comprehensive list of what does and does not work with tor and tbb?
For example, torchat, youtube html5 videos, facebook and most websites, vlc, thunderbird (although prone to timing analysis of multiple accounts used together), qtorrent, etc. All work for the most part.
But numerous websites fail totally or in part due to location blocking including many restricted youtube videos, anything flash based, nearly all non-html5 video, all mainstream voip/vid-chat, and mostly all applications that aren't designed to use tor/proxys.
