@_subject: [tor-talk] 0.3.0.6 on fedora 24: systemd? 
I asked the question online and got this suggestion:
At the commandline type:
command -v systemctl
echo $?
If the response to "echo" is 0 then you have systemd working.
If the response is 1 then you don't have systemd working.
Then you can check the script and see what you need to change to
have the script show systemd working.
Good luck!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is DNS required to connect to an entry node? 
Every time you enter a URL in the browser address line, your browser
requests the IP address of that URL from the DNS server.  You can
instead enter the IP address yourself along with the webpage requested.
You could also just make your own entry in a HOSTS file if you know how
to do it.  Caveat, do not mess with HOSTS unless you know what you are

About 1/3 the way down the page you will find the entry
for ExcludeNodes, or, do a FIND in your browser on that page.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Can no longer run tor-browser 
I am using Kubuntu 14.04 LTS on my desktop and on a laptop.
I was using tor-browser_en-US on both when suddenly both
have stopped working for an unknown reason.  There is no
log to report and no indication of what the cause is.  I
have repeatedly tried to delete the directory with the
program in it and re-install the directory and run the program
from there.  After multiple attempts on both computers I
have to admit defeat and ask for some suggestions.
Thank you!

Then tor-browser started normally.

I also have had trouble starting TOR Browser. I did the following in a
 ps -A|egrep tor
  232 ?        00:00:05 usb-storage
  499 ?        00:00:55 usb-storage
 1980 ?        00:00:00 usb-storage
 2872 ?        00:22:22 ktorrent
 3066 ?        00:00:00 indicator-bluet
 3069 ?        00:00:23 indicator-power
 3072 ?	       00:00:88 tor
This is useful iff you are using a linux OS.
(For non programmers iff stands for "if and only if".)
What has happened is TOR did not close properly in Kubuntu 14.04
Then I did the following:
kill -9 3072
At that point it killed off TOR that remained running.  After that I was
able to restart TOR Browser normally.  This happens consistently about
1/3rd of the time.
It may not help you, but I am sending this in the off chance it will help.
Good luck!

A thought along these lines occurred to me.  With all the "cloud"
functions out there today, why is it that someone can't run a cloud
server that allows users to login anonymously and use a browser to surf
the Internet, or, use email, as an anonymous user?
You get a login name, but no other identification, and a password, then
just do your online thing, whatever it is, with no record of where you
login from.  I wonder if anyone has something like that already?

Please ignore this.  I saved it as a draft, then fixed the actual
problem and when I deleted the draft, it apparently "sent".
My apologies!

Some distros have "usbguard" available in the repositories.  One CAVEAT: when installing this particular program
it will lockout every usb port on your computer, so if you have a mouse or keyboard working on usb, they will be locked out after installation.  I have contacted the maintainer of the .deb package to recommend a change, but
don't know if (s)he will implement it.  I managed to lock myself out of the computer by installing this program and
I had to use a LiveCD to go in and remove the program, then I logged back in and purged all of the program.
If you have a laptop then your keyboard will still work and whatever comes with the computer that is not connected
to a USB port.
If your particular distro does not have this program, then good luck!
To check: apt-cache search usbguard
at the terminal.
Also, this is the wrong forum for this query.  I suggest in the future all inquiries about linux be directed to a linux forum.
Good luck!

============================== START ==============================
If you add an icon for Wahay, it can more easily be added to the Menu Editor in Internet as a "New Item".? The icon makes it more readily identifiable in the menu.? Adding it to the menu is pretty cut-and-dried.? It does start in Kubuntu 18.04, but I have not attempted yet to join any meetings nor to start one.
Sounds like a terrific addition to the arsenal of privacy!
