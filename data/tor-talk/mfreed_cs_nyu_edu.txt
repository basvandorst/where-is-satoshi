Hi Joe,
I run CoralCDN ( although I also used to work with Roger on the Free Haven Project. We have many of the same issues with running CoralCDN, which is deployed at ~150 PlanetLab sites, most at universities.  We push out a bit over 2 TB per day in web traffic to > 1 million clients.
Part of our solution for handling some of these issues to to limit bandwidth consumption, part is to enforce blacklists for websites that send abuse complaints (although operating at the HTTP layer this is a bit easier for us), and part is to make sure we add all the appropriate HTTP HTTP headers like X-Forwarded-For, Via, and Proxy-Connection all communicate to the third-party services performing address authentication (such as the ACM or IEEE digital library) that the communication is from elsewhere.  While you certainly won't be able to / don't want to identify the correct X-Forwarded-For address, you can at least synthesize some fake one (perhaps just a 10.x.x.x address).  But again, this operates at the application layer.
Our experience is that universities don't care as much about peak bandwidth as they do about steady-state traffic: 5 Mbit/s at steady state translates to over 50 GB / day.  We've found many universities get uncomfortable around 15-20 GB / day.  In CoralCDN, we employ application-level bandwidth tracking that allows higher burst rates, but ensure that steady-state consumption over the long period stays below this high water mark.
Good luck,

Your server needs to provide proper Cache-Control (i.e., expires) headers when using CoralCDN if you'd like it to actually update your site regularly, following HTTP caching conventions. Otherwise, CoralCDN's default expiry period is 24 hours.
