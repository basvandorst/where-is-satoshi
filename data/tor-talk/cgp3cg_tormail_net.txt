@_subject: [tor-talk] How to use Tor Browser without TBB Bundle? 
IIRC you were using a transparent proxy, so Aurora shouldn't actually
know that the proxy exists. But because it comes from the TBB it is
trying to connect to Tor. So if you change the Aurora network settings
so that there is no proxy then all should be OK.
This should do the trick:
  Edit/Preferences/Advanced/Network/Connection/No Proxy
