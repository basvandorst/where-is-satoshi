@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor mentioned on Canadian News Network 
Global National is a popular Canadian news channel based in Ottawa. On the 29th they aired a two minute segment on Bitcoin in which Tor was mentioned. They immediately tag Bitcoin with Silk Road and Black Market Reloaded: "To reach it [the site] you need the software called Tor. To buy something you can only use Bitcoin."
For those interested, the site is globalnews.ca. This piece seems to have been an excerpt (promo) for a fifteen minute Bitcoin segment that aired on their "16X9" program today. I haven't been able to get that program yet.
The takeaway for the typical viewer is likely that Tor is an enabler for the Dark Side.
"Darth Dingledine" would be a rather catchy moniker. :)

I'm running 3.5 as well. Don't recognize that particular issue. Sounds like NoScript to me. Browser behavior can vary widely from site to site with NoScript running.

@_subject: [tor-talk] P2P Data Not Private, But It Could Be 
Interesting article by Bennett Haselton in Slashdot today. I mention here for those who may have missed it:
"/A court rules that law enforcement did not improperly 'search' defendants' computers by downloading files that the computers were sharing via P2P software. This seems like a reasonable ruling, but such cases may become rare if P2P software evolves to the point where all downloads are routed anonymously through other users' computers."
Another interesting point:
a 100-megabyte file by routing your download through three other users' computers, it will usually be much slower and more inconvenient than if you'd downloaded the file directly. In a few years, you won't notice the It's a good read; probably worth a few minutes.
I'd post the link but that creeps some folks out. Just go to Slashdot (.org) and look for it. Posted today (11/14). Title same as subject line

There may be interesting reading for you in the January archives for this mailing list. They are here:
The post 'Terminology: Deep v Dark Web' originated by Katya Titov might be a good start. We would, I'm sure, welcome any thoughts or results that you and your group might have on the matter.
Best of luck to you.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Security in Tor Browser related to Firefox ESR 
New releases are announced here and in the website blog. Changes are mentioned and a link to the changelog is provided. That shows that we've been in 24.2 since mid-December and 24.3 will appear with TBB 3.5.2, due for release within the next week or so (I presume).
Are we 'now subject to security vulnerabilities'? Sure! And we'll be subject to the yet-unknown vulnerabilities of 24.3 when it's released in TBB. It's a work in progress.

I'm not a Hulu user but I've been watching 'The Daily Show...' on Hulu for about 30 minutes now with no problem. I'm in the US also and run an exit relay on the same network.What am I missing here? Are you streaming through Tor?

Weather maybe? The period roughly coincides with some pretty tough times across the entire eastern US. My little exit relay hardly affects the metrics but I was down for 4 days with no electricity. Perhaps some more-significant assets were affected?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Terminology: Deep v Dark Web 
Why should you be stuck with anything? You're writing an important piece for an important project: You know... the onion with the crown? What you're writing may well become a source, a reference. You drive the conversation. All the words are belong to you. :)
In a very broad sense I'd suggest:
'Commercial' that is open to all (sort of) and is after whatever can be 'Private' that is behind all those heavy-metal firewalls and exists primarily in support of 'commercial'.
'Neutral' for those referred to as 'deep' or 'dark' and, like Tor, seek to be common carriers:Identity is by choice, not by mandate. The connotations of the word 'neutral' are benign. It also suggests 'net neutrality' (original recipe... not KFCC's extra-crispy). Further, 'Neutral Net' has a nice ring to it. Shorten that to 'NeuNet' and the media might run with the concept. They love that stuff; it makes the Pulitzer fairies run around in their heads.
Happy trails,

Here's an interesting tidbit. This looks like a grudge match couched in righteousness. I expect that facts and reality will be hard to come by. Note the date on this bit; apparently all this goes back a ways.

Please explain more. Are you running Tor now? How? What platform?
There is a Tor Browser Bundle for OS X. It is here:
I don't run Apple products but maybe this will help you get started.
Good luck!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Blacklists 
Sounds like an exit issue, not a client issue. The host at some time detected unsavory activity from an IP address so they tagged it. It was probably an exit relay that has no knowledge of any of this. CB tried to access the site and happened to draw the blocked exit relay. Joe got a different circuit so no problem.
Under this scenario CB should have access with a different circuit.
I've got the "reverse problem" as a small exit. I tried to access a site in the clear and could not do it. After some head scratching I tried TBB and got in no problem. So my address got tagged because of something that passed through me.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What was the academic paper in which 
The "DoJ... 3%" reference was in the 20C3 talk (2013) by RD & JA at about 11 minutes in. I've got the video and don't recall where I got it but it wasn't YouTube. The talk at that point was about the perception of Tor and a slide was put up with four bullet points, the first of which was "Doj's aborted study finding 3% bad content on the Tor network".
Both RD & JA briefly commented on it but there's little more than what Andrew has already conveyed. I'll be happy to transcribe that portion here if you can't find the video.
IMO, though the 20C3 production values weren't the best, the talk itself was one of the better ones. It's a keeper.
Good luck with your work.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB 4.0 default screen size 
Agreed. Pretty much...... (Wheezy/32/XFCE)
File > Close from the menu with pane open gets normal and expected behavior. All close and no glitches even with browser window maximized with XFCE's margins set. Restart normal.
Close via the title bar close button gets the "you are about to close X tabs" message then leaves the hanging pane. Restart fails because FF is still running. Close hanging pane and restart is normal.
It took me a while to find this because I haven't closed apps with the title bar close button in years, for this very reason.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Comcast looking for Tor traffic, 
If you factor the PinkMeth post here (earlier this week) into this it might make more sense. It's a firestorm and the locals want a head on a pike. The company is outside of Pittsburgh and owned by the girl's mother. Comcast is based in PA and effectively "family owned". Perhaps the mysterious "Jeremy" is on a mission from a higher power that's looking for any reason at all to bust your chops.
Circumstantial evidence at this point but I think this just might be Happy trails.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Cloudflare and BBC issues 
The two issues seem related to me. Maybe not. I'm just gonna add some data points.
For me it's torrentfreak.com. Been going there for years via Tor following the sharing culture (movement? insurrection?). Been doing that since Lessig's 'Remix' days. The Cloudflare captcha has been a show-stopper for two weeks now. The translation from Dutch says it would be "easier next time with JS enabled". It should say "possible ...". Lousy translation, eh?
I've sent TF an email asking for comment. Even suggested they join the conversation here. I suspect that a large part of their hits are via Tor so I expect they're feeling the impact. I'm pretty sure their model is less about metadata and more about hits. What's interesting too is that they don't enable torrenting, they just cover the culture. Journalism.
The wrinkle is that I'm also an exit relay (US, 16 months, from home). I can waltz right into TF in the clear from this IPa (JS disabled). So it appears that they're not targeting exit addresses, they're targeting the browser itself. Apparently you can arrive any way you like, but you've gotta have ID.
As for the BBC, I can get to both sites (domestic and international, JS disabled) with no problems, Tor or not. I thought I might hit something like the Cloudflare thing but not so. Looks like maybe the "BBC-not" experience was custom built for you guys on the continent. Best of luck with that. (BTW: I don't use BBC so I just hit the home pages.)

TF has replied to my email request for comment. Issue seems resolved. Copy below.
Not *exactly* what I expected but I suspect that Ernesto is responding somewhat diplomatically since I requested up front that I be allowed to post their reply here. No objection.
Hi Rick,
Sorry to hear about your trouble. We don't want to lock anyone out, but there have been some attacks from Tor ranges previously.
I just visited Cloudflare, pulled some handles and flipped a few switches. Let me know if that improves things for you.
Cheers, Ernesto

Grace was responding to my original post which you might have missed. This was from the site owner's email to me. The "handles.......switches." were not to be taken literally.
Her definitions are the same as mine. Did you have JS enabled when you encountered the captcha? Did you enable it while working through the
