@_subject: [tor-talk] Connections to the same circuit? Make them different? 
While prototyping an app i was looking at ip addresses and connections.
I notice all my connections uses the same circuit and have the same IP
Address. Then it hit me, it just may be because i am using one proxy
(silly thought, proxies shouldnt affect circuits) so i tried making two
proxies. Well anyways I tried visiting two different sites every few
seconds so i can watch their connection in vidalia and i see they still
use the same circuit and the many others are idle.
Is there some way i can say use a different circuit? or do not use this
circuit for the next little while?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Where might I post about my Encrypt PM code? 
I just posted in tor-dev "My RSA-PM client-server"
and last month with the subject "Encrypted PM site/hidden service"
I finished some client/server code so people can send eachother private
messages. It isn't peer to peer because I had a hint of a suspicion that
it would be easier to find someone IP address when a hidden service (to
connect to as tor-chat does) seemly always appear and go offline at the
same time.
I wanted to post my code some places and wondered where you guys might
think is interesting. I don't have the server hosted anywhere but i'm
sure someone may be interested in using this code.
If your curious the code is located at

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor + windows 7 firewall 
I found this and decided to try it in my VM
What the incorrect (yet marked accepted) answer doesn't say is how to
block all outgoing ports. When you open "windows firewall with advance
security" there is a "Windows firewall properties" right there on the
first page. Its in the middle column at the bottom of the overflow box.
The 2nd tab (Private Profile) is where you may block outgoing ports even
tho the first 3 tabs look the same.
Then you can add the tor program to the allow list. I tried firefox
(plain) to confirm no connections (also tried ping) then i added firefox
to allow outgoing and it worked. I added tor to the list then started it
up using the TBB. Tor couldn't connect and i couldnt figure out why. I
also allowed vidalia and the portable firefox but still no go.
My question is has anyone gotten this to work? Allowing only tor in
windows? The next question is how do you know if its working correctly
and no leaks happen? This idea was just for fun. I personally never
downloaded documents except one on the project tor site and i believe it
was using https so i doubt any exists modified the contents. I could
block my pdf reader (i dont use adobe lol. Its too bulky) and maybe i
will but this was just an idea that i wondered if anyone got working

@_subject: [tor-talk] More secure hidden service as client or relay? 
I read about a successful attack on hidden services. The two major
attacks i remember were 1) Looking at IP addresses in the network and
check if the hidden service is up. When its down you can narrow the ip
address down. 2) Disconnecting and reconnecting to the hidden service
hoping you become a peer and use a timing attack. This is prevented by
node guards which was talked about in the PDF (before and after the
That same pdf mention clients were easier to find then relays. I'm not
sure why.
Right now at this moment what is more secure when running a hidden
service. When being a client or relay?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Will Hidden Service Be Removed? 
Personally I don't really like them. I think using hidden service as an
IP address for peer to peer (like torchat) is a risk factor although I
don't know enough to know for sure. (Maybe the already in place guards
fix that?). But I also think all the content in a hidden service are not
beneficial to anyone. Wikileaks may have been one but it looks like they
have no problems getting hosting/a domain and staying online
Is there a real reason why the or project can't just disable hidden
services? IMO no positive exists as the content can be served on
clearnet (once again wikileaks is fine and that is a big deal). Hidden
services is just carrying negatives.
I guess my question is will it be removed and if not can I assume it
will always exist and also why will it not be removed?
FYI I only made one anonymous app. No one uses it (although its because
no one runs a server) and its fully legal and only requires users to
access it via tor. No hidden services required.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Will Hidden Service Be Removed? 
IIRC You send DMCA takedowns to the webmaster first and I seen sites
that ignore it and don't get shut down. But I'm not saying 'i have
nothing to hide' is the reason. Its more of 'even if i should hide it, i
can have it hosted on the web' (as in clearnet). Which is why I mention
wikileaks and TPB is another good example. What I am saying is for
hosting purposes, sites are not shut down even if many countries (or
companies) would like them to be shut down.
But I didn't think about accessing a computer via ssh using hidden
services. Having ssh access can ruin security but is there a reason the
server/computer must be hidden? I'd understand why you or your connect
should be hidden but why the server? I'm pretty sure if using encrypted
end to end (https, ssh) your exit node wont have any idea whats going on
except you connected to some ipaddress and i guess knowing i you used
https or ssh (or something else?). Do you actually have that as a
service or did you make that example up?
I don't know anything about that. All i heard was it was shut down for a
time (how?) and people send people drugs. They hope they can trust the
dealer. (either not being the police or sending them something that wont
kill them). Do I need to guess what you mean by epic win or will you
explain a little?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Will Hidden Service Be Removed? 
What I thought was due to reading some old papers. I believe they are
currently fixed. I think there was some directory listing? If a service
repeatedly goes up and down (because it was a client and not on a replay
server) you can compare what ipaddresses get a match. I believe there
was another attack including it being very obvious to guards but that
was an old paper.
Agreed but then I believe they won't be targeted or encourage to shut
Yes but A) They wouldnt have the know how to setup a tor service let
alone set up a website B) Theres no reason they can't use a 3rd party
clearnet site anonymously through tor. Such as wordpress or tumblr.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Multiple servers with SAME hidden service 
After trying to think of privacy flaws in hidden service (which i still
don't like) I began to wonder
What happens if you have MULTIPLE servers with the same hidden service?
As in you have a small VPS which is getting busy and you'd like to share
the load with another VPS. Assuming they know about eachother and works
correctly when the two servers are under the same domain name. What
happens if two servers try to advertise the same service? Will it not
break anything? If might 4/5ths of users only access one server?
Not that I think anyone needs multiple servers for one service.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Ecosystem? 
I'm interested in how tor has been affected and will be affected in the
coming weeks. Are there less users now that many onion sites
disappeared? More? Is there a decrease in bittorrent which I doubt. How
about the bandwidth is it 1/5 of what it was last week? etc
I'm curious if users or hidden services are more easily detectable if
there is a sharp decrease in users and or hidden services.

@_subject: [tor-talk] security myth? 
What are some myths and real things to watch for when using tor?
One example may be connecting and immediately posting somewhere. Someone
can track you connecting to the network with the post. Is this real or a
myth? From my understanding only guard nodes would know if your
connected to the network.
What other things may a person need to keep in mind?
