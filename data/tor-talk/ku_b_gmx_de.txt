@_subject: firefox v3.5.2 and torbutton crash 
if this not the correct list to report above issue please appologies and a mild hint where to report would be welcome.
Previously I used FF3.0.2, which crashed the same way. Switch the tor button on and FF gives up. Even though before that several months all was After the update to FF3.5.2 and the mozilla.com torbutton add-on its still the same situation. Is this known? Anything special I can do to nail that issue down? Tor v0.2.1.19 runs here on a Linux client.
One related bug I found was but seems closed.

I would first first like to search my problem in a list archive for reducing list volume. Is there any?

A search form is not provided there. To search so many folders by hand - huh. Sorry, for saying not clearly, that I meant a automated search.
Anyway thanks,

I see often captchas on google with cookies on in FF3 and avoid now filling them as they never worked. But it works a little better in recent days, with the "Sorry but ..." page and captchas becoming less frequent.
