I can see the new SSL certificate for *.torproject.org, issued 2016-04-15.
I'd prefer the FAQ entry to be updated rather than removed. It gives me a
little confidence in the site, though presumably anyone who was MITM-ing the
SSL connection would also changes the fingerprint on the FAQ!
The blog.torproject.org certificate is still in date until 2017-06-14 but my
certificate viewer shows this is issued by DigiCert not RapidSSL as stated
on the FAQ. Also the FAQ quotes SHA1 and MD5 fingerprints for the
certificate,  both of these are broken (but hopefully not for the same
cert!) I'm not too wrorried but can someone post the correct info to the
FAQ? A SHA-256  fingerprint would also be good.

I had that too on my Debian Jessie stable with KDE. Not had a problem on Windows / Firefox 45.2.0.

Hi - the question as to which is the "real" onion address and which is the
"fake" one is a matter of interpretation. Normally there's a "real" onion
first and then some copy-cats later - then you can compare the copy-cats to
the original and decide that they are fakes. But what if you don't find out
about the "real" onion if you've already found the copy-cat first and put
that in your list? Or what if the "real" owner decides that they want to
change onion address, would you mark that as a "fake" ? It's not cut-and-dry, I appreciate that you're doing your best to find the
fakes and weed them out. It sounds like a hard job but someones gotta do it
so thanks.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Operation Onymous Technical Explanation? 
If the attacker can take control of both the guard node of a
hidden service and it's rendezvous point then they can do a traffic
correlation attack to find the IP of the hidden service. If you're running a
hidden service you can mitigate against this by choosing a relay you trust.
Next generation hidden services are being worked on in Prop 224
