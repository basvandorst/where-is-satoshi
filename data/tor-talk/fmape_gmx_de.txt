Hi again,
didn't want to sound demanding, sorry if I did.
Thanks for your reply.

I just tried to chroot my Tor Server  using the Scripts accessable on
 . when running /etc/init.d/tor
I find the following in the log file:
[notice] Tor 0.1.0.10 opening log file.
[notice] Initialized libevent version 1.1 using method epoll
[err] finish_daemon (): /dev/null can't be opened. Exiting.
What does it mean? I'm not a linux guru at all, just experimenting ...
Any ideas?
