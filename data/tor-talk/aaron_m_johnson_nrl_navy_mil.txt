Dear Tor friends,
This is just a reminder that HotPETs talk proposals are due *tomorrow* (April 24th). You can email your proposal to  (2 pages max, for details see ).
We would love to have the exciting recent developments in the design and use of Tor presented at HotPETs, and it is a great chance to interact with some of the world?s most accomplished cryptographers, scholars, hackers, and activists.

Dear Tor people,
The HotPETS workshop [0] has been a place for researchers, developers, and thinkers in privacy-enhancing technologies to share and discuss their latest ideas and results. Tor has always been a major part of this discussion, from the introduction of Tor?s bandwidth scanner [1] in 2008, to the unveiling of Tor?s move to a single guard in 2014 [2], and including much in between (for example, [3-6]).
HotPETS would like to continue to be a place for the Tor community to share their latest improvements and challenges. This year we are asking for only a *2-page talk proposal*. The submission deadline is *April 24th*. Details about submitting are in the Call for Talks [0]. Hopefully, this will make it even easier for more of the Tor community to participate, especially people who don?t write research papers for a living :-)
I hope to see many of you at HotPETS in Philadelphia on July 2nd!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Looking for excellent talks on Tor at HotPETs 2016 
Dear Tor fans,
If you are interested in presenting your work on Tor to world-class researchers and developers, consider submitting a talk proposal to the 9th Workshop on Hot Topics in Privacy Enhancing Technologies (HotPETs 2016). Two-page talk proposals should be emailed by May 13th to . For details, see .
We are looking for engaging talks on important topics in digital privacy. There have always been great Tor-related talks as part of HotPETs, including results you may have heard of, such as a talk on Sybil defense in Tor last year and a proposal in 2014 to move Tor users to one guard instead of three (since implemented). We hope to continue to provide a useful venue for people using, studying, and developing Tor to present their work. And because HotPETs is a part of the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS), its presenters get to speak to and meet some of the best cryptographers, developers, and security scholars on the planet.
The workshop will take place on July 22nd, 2016, in Darmstadt, Germany. Please note that travel funds may be available to support attendance at HotPETs, especially for accepted talks (email  for information). Both HotPETs and PETS are participating in Security & Privacy Week 2016, which includes several other concurrent conferences and workshops.
 Cheers,
 Aaron

Hi Griffin,
No, we are not set up to enable that.
Also, in case you were considering submitting, the deadline has already passed (it was May 13th).
Sorry to be so negative!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor official list of new .onion addresses? 
If you want to keep your onion address hidden, you should run a v3 onion service. An improvement of v3 over v2 is that Hidden Service Directories can no longer identify the onion address of the onion-service descriptors they store. As a result, there is no point in any Tor protocol at which a v3 onion address is leaked to any relay. As long as you keep the address to yourself, noone will be able to find it. For more information about v3 onion services, see >.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Strong Flow Correlation Attacks on Tor Using Deep 
My perspective on AS-aware path selection, having thought about the problem bit [0] and also proposed my own version [1], is that all such solutions suffer from a fatal problem that they leak information about the client location over time [2]. To illustrate this issue, suppose that you choose your guard such that the adversary is unlikely to observe the client-guard traffic. The adversary can use guard-discovery techniques to identify what your guard is. For example, guard discovery is trivial against onion-service clients and servers as both can be forced by the other end to create circuits until a malicious relay is chosen adjacent to the guard. That guard reveals some information about the client's location. The adversary can simply ask: which client locations are more likely to choose this guard?. Clients use multiple guards over time, and at a higher than you’d probably expect due to guard churn (if I recall correctly, one month is a good estimate for the median time until you need to use a new guard). Each additional guard that the the client chooses, that the adversary sees, and that the adversary can link as belonging to the same client, reveals more about the client’s location. Linking connections together over time is possible in many important situations: using a pseudonym in a Web forum or marketplace, running an onion service on any fixed onion address, administering a server that you are the only administrator for, connecting to IRC via a long-lived nickname.
So, I would not recommend to use AS-aware path selection algorithms at the moment.
