@_subject: proxy refusing connections 
hi, i setup everything, (using Mac Os X) in system preferences.  in  FIrefox, i set up the plug in that switches proxies.  when i switch  to TOR, it says that the proxy server is refusing connections. (standard firefox error page).  does that just mean that servers are  down, or something else?
