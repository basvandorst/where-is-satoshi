On my internet server, tor has a memory leak.
If I start tor, it requires 10 megabyte:
top - 19:13:12 up  1:24,  2 users,  load average: 0.07, 0.04, 0.00
 PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
29872 debian-t  15   0 20784  10m 4372 S    1  0.5   0:02.68 tor
After 16 hours of operation, it requires 94 megabyte:
 top - 09:58:15 up 16:09,  1 user,  load average: 0.07, 0.05, 0.00
 PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
21569 debian-t  16   0  107m  94m 5376 S    2  4.7  30:22.60 tor
My server is running Ubuntu 6.06, and I have these versions installed:
 dapper/main tsocks
1.8beta5-2~~weasel-ubuntu.1  dapper/main tor 0.1.2.19-1~dapper+1 [959kB]
Does anyone experience similar problems?
What further information is required to solve this?

I forgot to mention, that my internet server is running
as a middle-node.

I am also a new member of this group, and I try to answer
your question:
tor is about using the internet anonymously.
So yes, anyone, including hackers, can use tor to stay anonymously.
You have to protect yourself agains hackers anyway - if they use
tor or not.

Thanks for all the answers.
I was assuming that tors memory footage was linearily increasing since startup, therfore I used the term "memory leak".
This might prove to be wrong - so I will watch tors memory requirements on the server for a longer period and post the results.
However, it looks like tor requires an significat amount of memory.
My (rented) server has a guaranteed amount of 128 MB RAM,
and I am running apache webserver with ssl and php, postfix mail, cyrus imaps and ldaps on it.
I hope the server will prove to run stable with these
application together with tor.

thanks for all the help!
Tor has no memory leak on my server.
I reduced the band width settings from 200KB/400KB to this:
BandwidthRate 100 KB
BandwidthBurst 200 KB
and Tor uses around 90 MB of memory and is now running stable since 5 days:
28039 debian-t  16   0  107m  88m 7380 S    4  4.4 200:31.26 tor
If I want to run tor with higher BandwidthRate (attracting more users,
as Dominik explains below), then I have to rent a server with more
