After all, it wasn't that bad I had to rename it: we will add support
for i2p socks and tunnels shortly, meaning orwall may become something
like a Personal Privacy Routing App (well, ok, not routing "as is",
because we'll still use iptable in order to force app traffic through
tor or any i2p tunnel) :).
For information: current version is 0.13 Beta (yesss!), and it's pretty
stable and nice.
Support for Tethering (through Tor of course) and other network-related
things have been added, and are working fine.
Coming soon (hopefully): it should be added to f-droid repository (I
opened a thread on the submission queue), and, as soon as ciphernet
library has some more support regarding tor configuration (in order to
get orbot ports, mostly), we will integrate orbot support in a far
better way than now, allowing, among other things, to automatically
update its configuration if orbot ports change.
This will also help in order to get i2p support via a new api/library
being developed right now.
So. I'm pretty happy seeing this app getting some interest.
I'm also happy we can find a name satisfying anybody (though I wasn't
that sure about "orwall" at the beginning).
And I hope this app will be, once, listed somewhere as a
"privacy-aware-helper" app ;).
Don't hesitate to test it, report bugs, ask for features and so.
Just keep in mind its aim is to provide a userfriendly interface to
iptables in order to manage connections through
tor/local-privacy-services, not an iptables "multipurpose" interface ;).

Just a small announce (not sure if this is the right ML, sorry).
I'm developing an Android app allowing to block all IP traffic, and
force only selected app through Orbot.
This is done because neither Orbot nor AFWall (or other free, opensource
Android iptables managment interface) seem to be able to do that?
Website is here:  (yep, Switzerland, a
not-so-against-Tor country)
Source code is on github: Released under GPLv2
Still under heavy development, it's released under "alpha" tag. It
should go beta shortly (still have to add some new features as described
down the website).
Any feedback is welcome, it's not a so huge app, but I still think it
may be of some use for people wanting to ensure they don't send traffic
outside Tor, and wanting to redirect only some traffic through it.
Thanks for your attention and, most important, thank you for Tor, Orbot
and the freedom it provides!

Craps? right. I just updated to v3.
I was wanting to add the app to f-droid once it's in "beta" state, alpha
is maybe a bit early (though it shouldn't block the whole network
anymore now with latest release) ;).
Thanks for the license headup, and for pushing it to f-droid ? means it
may be of some interests indeed :).

Thanks for adding thins one on f-droid :).
Regarding your question (as well as Lunar's): yep, completely possible
to add this feature either to Orbot, or AFWall or anything else.
Torrific has two aims:
? personal one: know how to build an android app, play a bit with the
system while find ways to secure a bit more this kind of devices,
without being prejudicial for current apps. And I love having one app
specialized in one task, as for devices.
? community: just show what we can do with our devices, show how easy it
is for people to just take over the control on their phone, phablet or
To be honest, I won't cry if Orbot implements this functionality later
;). I'm not sure if Orbot should manage the firewall (though it's doing
it now, for the transparent proxy thing), as I prefer dedicated app for
special tasks? But that's my PoV I guess.
Also, there are some stuff I want to add to Torrific, as described on
the website.
Among them, probably the most interesting would be to allow a browser to
bypass Orbot, especially for captive portals (ever tried to log-in in
this kind of things through Tor? I did, didn't work well as expected ;) ).
Of course this could also be added to Orbot. But, as said, Orbot is
first of all a Tor connector (well, here again, my PoV ;) ).
That said: point taken. Who knows, maybe I'll submit later some patch to
Orbot in order to add this functionality directly in the app. I was more
willing to play with AFWall, as it already manage the iptables as a
dedicated task.
Thanks again for the f-droid push and interest :).

Hello Mike,
good point for IPv6 ? it won't block it for now (no call to ip6tables so
far, though it's already defined in the init-script).
Regarding the early rule applying: the app currently installs an
init-script with:
- INPUT/OUTPUT default policy to DROP
- first rule in INPUT/OUTPUT to REJECT
I had to ensure there is no network at all ? it seems some rules are
pushed really early in the chains, especially for the quota managing thing.
With this init-script, I ensure there is nothing IN nor OUT of the
device until torrific is launched. Even Orbot can't connect, which may
create some problems (and has created I think, though it's pretty
unclear for now and not really reproducible :( ).
Unfortunately, some android versions, such as 4.1.1, don't seem to
support user init-script ? meaning those may (and do!) send stuff on the
network before torrific is up :(.
After many tests on my nexus4, running 4.4.4, it appears the system
tries to send at least 100 packages on the network before we can even
use the device :).
There's a warning regarding init-script support on the site, I really
tried hard to make it work, but no luck so far :(.
Also, most probably a ROM update will remove the init-script and
torrific won't see that for now, I have to add some other checks. But
the idea is here, at least :).
? Knowing all is pretty useless on phone devices due to the closed
baseband and GSM protocol is pretty annoying but, at least, we can do
something in order to get a safer (if not "the safest") devices.

It's possible I push some pull-request later, yes.
But, as said in some previous email, I'm not really sure it's Orbot job
to set up firewall? I rather prefer dedicated app for dedicated task ?
Orbot main task is, for me, connecting to Tor network? Basically, this
just doesn't involve the firewall at all.
But yeah, I know, users like "all-in-one apps" ? who knows, once
torrific is ready (i.e. no more broken rules, no more bugs like "craps,
network's broken")? the devs may get some PR ;).
Torrific is also, for me, a way to play with android without annoying
other applications.
To be honest, I'd rather contribute this function in AFWall than Orbot,
as it already is a firewall manager (and not a bad one).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Android app: Torrific 
torrific works with an init-script blocking all the traffic ? same way
droidwall or afwall are working, same problem with older android versions.
torrific starts on boot, maybe earlier than orbot, which is a good
thing. it also uses orbot uid (as well as app uid) in order to set the
redirects and allow orbot to go out.
problems with handmade scripts: how to catch app uid automatically?
that's not userfriendly. Not at all?
That was the first version of this app: an init-script, a "lib" written
in shell, and a script applying the rules, using a shell array as source
for application information.
the app I've done lists the installed application requesting network
access, you just have to check those you're wanting to allow network
access and they are forced through orbot :).

Hello Mike, nice to see you're following this small project, your post
was really inspiring! My nexus7 original ROM didn't see the light, it
was directly erased (though I prefer slimroms over CM). I stumbled on it
a bit after starting my project.
Also supported on Slimroms, that's how I'm closing all IP network:
Yep, it's on the TODO. This part will be a bit tricky in the UI, but I
think I have a nice way to do that :)
Also, I'll implement the possibility to get "a browser" (the one we
wish) to bypass the whole firewall/Orbot thing for captive portals. You
also added such a script
This will also add support for other SIP applications such as CSipSimple
(the one proposed for Ostel.co services).
Sure, that's why I'm wanting to implement it. Plus, it will be a good
exercise with Android UI :). As an option you may activate in the
settings, with some warning regarding security issues and so

some news regarding this app:
Name / legal:
for now, I didn't get any answer from Andrew Lewman, who kindly
contacted me?
I added mentions so that it's clear torrific isn't from Tor Project.
Maybe that's enough ? as I don't get answer, I stick with it. We will
see the outcome, hopefully it will stay as is.
- enable browser to bypass firewall and orbot in order to connect to
some captive portal. It requires the user to select an app in the
settings, enabling the menu entry. When he enable the browser bypass,
there's a 5-minutes timers, after that the rule is removed. User can, of
course, remove the rule himself, just tapping the option in the menu
- enable SIP UDP bypass: as pointed by Mike Perry, this is a good thing;
hence, the user may select his SIP application in the settings, and this
also enables an menu entry? Tapping on it set a *persistent* flag
allowing UDP traffic from the selected app to go out. Persistent means:
next reboot will see the rules applied as well.
- enable tethering: I get some requests in order to enable tethering (I
wasn't that happy, as it may go insecure because of apps running on the
third-party device). Enabling it requires to activate the option in the
settings, and enable/disable the rules from the menu.
All tethered traffic goes through Tor. No alternative (for now).
- init-script management: allows to enforce init-script (it's installed
after android update), or disable it (basically: remove the init-script)
Most probably there are some bugs. But for now the app runs without any
problems on two of my devices, and I'm happy with that ;).
If anybody wants to give it a try, and catches some bugs or, more
important, sees errors in iptables rules (that's what I really fear),
please open issues, or contact me by mail if you don't want to open a
github account (or be seen providing advices for this app, who knows ;) ).

This should close the "naming discussion" I guess. Though US people may want to argue because it's, also, the name of a democrat politic (just checked on duck). Woohoo. Don't care this time ;) .
Name will change on the next release, though the lib itself will probably stay with the original name.
Just to be sure, nothing against this one I hope, if we put aside the politics? I'm not US?

Hello Nathan,
thanks for this email, that makes me really happy! Be sure I'll do my

Though it's still alpha, it should go beta in a few days (if not hours?)
meaning it will be the right time for everyone to try it, and ask for
features, corrections and, if possible, participate for translations :).
I'm currently struggling a bit with the init-script, it seems it doesn't
work anymore when we have a crypted /data? I'm currently investigating
this nasty bug, but I think it will be solved nicely, installing the
script in /system/etc/init.d directory (thus, mount -o remount,rw, copy,
chmod, mount -o remount,ro).

just a small update regarding orWall: it's released 1.0.0!
There's still *one* annoying issue regarding the tethering, but it
should be OK next week. Just have to take some time in order to debug
this for good.
orWall provides now a brand new UI in order to be easier to handle.
There's also an integrated help (as a first-start wizard we might call
later on).
There are many new features and improvements, like:
- ability to disable all rules and let the device access freely the Net
- for each app, the possibility to access some advanced settings
allowing to bypass Tor, or tell orWall the app knows about proxies or Tor
- better management for the init-script
- better management for iptables rules
- translations in French, German and Italian are almost done
Any feedback from Tor/Orbot users interest me in order to improve
orWall. I think the current release is pretty good, but as the main dev
I'm maybe not that neutral regarding this statement ;).

True :/. It's a bit explained in the wizard though. But I think the
wizard might be worked out a bit more, it's painfully long and full of text.
yup. This part is hard, and I don't think I'll be able to find a
solution alone. I'll open an issue on the github tracker and place a big
"help wanted" in it :).
Oh, well, they also decided to follow Oracle JVM Cipher list, you know?
Nothing surprises me now ;).
Same for me. This part will be complicated due to different kernel
some supports LOG target, other NFLOG, and the latter doesn't provide
any nflog reader in the ROM (heya, Cyanogenmod, you're brain-dead on this!).
Thus it means:
- detecting which kind of log is supported
- create some UI in order to activate logs (already have some ideas)
- inject some binary in the system for nflog support
- ? and many other things.
Maybe this can be avoided, as AFWall+ is considering providing some
intents as API end-points. This would mean:
- install orWall
- install AFWall+
and you'll get the best of both worlds, as AFWall will take care of the
iptables and log interfaces, just executing orWall orders?
Thanks for your feedback!

orWall first aim was to provide an interface for Mike's scripts ? it
already goes far beyond this simple task now.
Regarding AFWall+ (and DroidWall), it *will* interfere badly. Don't even
try it unless you have some iptables knowledges, an USB cable and a
towel ;).
I will add "different connection type support" to the roadmap (as I
already had such a request), but don't count on it before some other
things more "orWall-related" devs (like a better tethering support).
And it will most probably be integrated to the "advanced settings"
interface in order to provide a simple interface for "lambda" users.
Fact is: this won't be really easy to integrate in a way it doesn't
break the whole thing. Will need to think about it. Deeply.

Well, thank you :). Tor ecosystem deserves support, devs and apps.
Especially on mobile, seeing how it goes.
I think we should share a bit about that, either live on IRC (find
"tengu" on freenode or geeknode ? I'm CET time) or whatever you find
suitable (MLs, direct mails, issues on GH? whatever).
Currently, I think it's kind of hard to provide a simpler interface due
to the fact the user choses which app goes through orbot or not?
Regarding texts: I cannot disagree. But I'm maybe not the best person
for wording, maybe some other people may provide better strings, shorter
words/expressions and so on.
By the way: my mother tongue isn't English, hence I probably make
mistakes, using longer sentences than needed and so on ;).
You're probably thinking about the "torify all" feature I guess? I'm
kind of reluctant to push this into orWall, as, if I understand
correctly, orbot should provide some kind of proxy using vpnservices?
Of course, if this feature isn't doable, I'll see into orwall in order
to provide the button on the "home" page.
Guess we should really discuss all of that. And collaborate closer ;).

I'd rather read Mike's blog post[1] and take his scripts in order to
lock OUTPUT chain for good, allowing only debian-tor user traffic to go
out. Sadly you won't be able to filter out traffic as on Android, as
most of the application will run with your own user. But Tor does have
his dedicated user, so some magic is still possible in order to prevent
any leak.
Something like that *should* be OK:
# lock down network
$ipt -P OUTPUT DROP
$ipt -P INPUT DROP
$ipt -P FORWARD DROP
# allow local connections
$ipt -I OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
$ipt -I INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
# allow debian-tor outputs
$ipt -I OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner debian-tor -j ACCEPT
# allow related/established incoming
$ipt -I INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

--to-ports $DNSPROXY

$ipt -t nat -I PREROUTING ! -i lo -p tcp --syn -j REDIRECT --to-ports

For any months I'v been running an exit node.
That was fine until a few weeks? Now I get twice a week an abuse
notification from Hetzner, because script kiddies and other sad people
are using Tor in the wrong way.
I'm wondering if I could configure an exit proxy between my exit node
and the clear net in order to deny accesses to specific URL parts, like
"wp-login.php" and other well-known stuff.
That would help a lot. I was thinking about privoxy or, maybe, squid
(with cache deactivated, of course).
Of course, this would be used only for HTTP, but at least that should
prevent some misuses.
Does anyone already configured this kind of thing?

Hello Moritz,
thank you for your feedback. I'll try to convince my provider to put me
as "abuse contact" so that I can handle those emails without having to
make 10'000 emails (to the provider, to the "victim" and so on), but I'm
pretty sure they won't: they already didn't want to deactivate their
"netscan" thing that triggers alarm for nothing as well, though I
already told them the IP is dedicated, running on a dedicated instance,
that runs only Tor as exit?
I'm pretty sure I'll have to cut this exit down, and won't be able to
run a new one elsewhere :(.
The proxy thing was an elegant solution, displaying a 403 error when
people try to access the pages ? but indeed, this can as well deny
access by legit users? It's a pity seeing that many bots using Tor, and
we cannot do anything against this kind of usage (well, of course, this
is intended ;) ).
