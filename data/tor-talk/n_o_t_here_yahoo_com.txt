@_subject: Attempts to compromiseTOR servers running windows? 
When I set up tor I gave this yahoo address  as a contact address. Just before the thanksgiving holiday I noticed a  lot of spam with a zipped file containing the sober worm as an  attachment. I have since received about three thousand messages and Ive  begun to notice a pattern. It seems that these are addresses that come  from tor contact addresses. I have also received error messages (from  Yahoo?) that indicate that mail that I never sent from my yahoo account  could not be sent. Any ideas?

Guess I spoke to soon (without thinking).
I was thinking about something on the user side. I
don't know how many users would edit the source code
to get around something like this. I understand that tor is about privacy and anonimity.

@_subject: Proxy server setting hijacked 
In order for tor to work correctly the proxy is set manually. Has anyone come upon a page that changes the proxy settings? Recently I have noticed changes twice once to auto detect and another to auto by url. Does anyone have a solution to this problem? I'm not really sure when the settings took affect.

Looking at my settings and it appears java could be the problem. Thanks very much for the advice. I've just added the noscript add-on to firefox.
 -Jed
 It might be possible that you are viewing pages with Java,ActiveX, or
some other scripting language that is changing it. Get firefox (if you
don't already have it at getfirefox.com) and the noscript add-on
(google it) for browsing with tor.

@_subject: Method of detecting intermediary communication device. US Patent 7,466,654 
Could this be applied to TOR? Here is the abstract. "A method of detecting an intermediary communication device in a
     communication path of a target communication device by inserting a sensor
     in the path, recording communication packets to and from the target
     communication device, recording times for the packets, identifying
     packets in a first interconnection layer, calculating a minimum latency
     time for the packets, identify packets in a second interconnection layer
     that is at a different communication processing level than that of the
     first interconnection layer, calculating a minimum latency time for the
     packets of the second interconnection layer, and determining that an
     intermediary communication device is present in the path if an absolute
     difference between the minimum latency times is above a user-definable
     threshold."

@_subject: not in the list. Not in the tor network map. 
I attached the picture previously. Looks like it got cropped a little too much. The list of relays on the side begin with the letter A. The relay atlgonyovLi as well as the others connected in that circuit were not in the list on the left side. They are all listed now. So my connection was going through relays that were not in the list or on the map.

@_subject: Geo Tracing/Locate Tor Network 
Better resolution would be cool. The only thought I have is about the security risk of leaking important information about the route you are taking.
Two questions (sorry if these are somewhere in the FAQ)
First, where does Vidalia get the IP info for mapping Tor? IP addresses based on the directory?
Second, what does Vidalia use to geolocate the IP? Is there a db or an API preferred?
I realized this is somewhat off topic but if I have the time I would love to take the time to write a KML file for Google Earth, mostly for coolness sake. (And the resolution is better.)
Any other ideas?

This would make perfect sense if the reduced number of relays exist for the purpose of tracking. If I'm an adversary and I can control the relays that your exit connects to I can narrow down my search for the end user.

This is a wacky idea. No harm in trying though. How about trying something like hidemyass through tor? I know it doesnt really provide anonymity, but maybe it will mask your location long enough to open an account. If you can open the account then reset your password after setup.

I guess the question is what exactly are you looking for? SSL?
I was able to setup an email account (at)mail2world.com (no fancy tricks) I made sure to document and verify plausibility of all my answers (time zone zip code match area). Password length is limited to 12 chars. The password length threw me had to use my other answers to change it. Also had to put address as https to make it work since the radio button didnt work.

Last I checked encryption in yahoo mail is only available for login to your account. Everything else goes in the clear easily intercepted if an exit is logging. Easily intercepted over open wifi in a cafe.

I wouldn't recommend TOR for anything personally identifying (anything done on TOR has a chance of greater scrutiny and malicious subversion). Have used Facebook through TOR with SSL enabled and watched a friends computer get exploited during a chat session. SSL is pretty well broken from my point of view. I wouldnt trust TOR for any executable download or software update (pdfs and other exploited forms of media are questionable too). Best use for tor is in a read only environment where no writable media is present on your computer. I would recommend locking your bios, it might not matter if there is a default secondary password.

That might be possible (not identifying yourself). But a few risks may remain. Consider the following: Have you ever used facebook before? Do you or have you talked in the past (FB email chat) with the people you are planning to communicate with? Do these people have any particularly identifying ideology?
Here is the problem I see with facebook. You have a biometric characteristic to the way you type. This can narrow the probability of who you are say to 1 in 25,000. The same can be said for the people you talk to. If you have previously communicated on facebook there is likely a signature there. There are millions on facebook but each additional person you friend is going to narrow down the possible network. If you friend a previous friend on facebook now the combined signature is more unique. The ideology part ties into the topics and words that people use which is also identifying. If you have the advantage of communicating in a different language and alphabet I'd recommend it.

I have only my own personal experience. Certainly TOR would be targeted to some degree. The chat exploit was interesting and I suspect I unintentionally mentioned a keyword that is being watched. The way the text got moved around makes me suspect that some control ASCII characters were being used to navigate through all previous chats with this particular individual. The browser on my friend's end recovered eventually. It's possible (I have no way of proving) that my friend's unencrypted connection was the one targeted. But the question remains why. I suspect the attack was due to both using TOR and using an innocuous word that is a word used to describe something connected to TOR.

I think its just like the hide my ass deal. If you turn off javascript in a regular search (outside tor) startpage doesnt work.
Actually, there seem to be various issues. This was reported a couple of
days ago on the Blog
with a different message. Also check out the answers. Myself I just
checked it a few minutes ago and the result or answer was fine with
nothing remarcable.
On the other hand, if your screenshot is real, I wonder how about the
label we don't track you? Maybe it's like the Hide My Ass case, they are
all about privacy, yet they sell their users to the first to ask.
