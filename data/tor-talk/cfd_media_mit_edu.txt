@_subject: [tor-talk] obfsproxy firewall settings? 
When running obfsproxy, Tor registers the obfs2 server transport at a
different port from the port on which OR is listening.
Which ports need to be accessible through a firewall on the bridge node?
 And which ports do tor-assistants need to be aware of?

@_subject: [tor-talk] nagios check for bridge relays? 
Has anyone written a nagios plugin to check that a bridge relay is
running and functional?  The docs [1][2] suggest just looking for log
entries after starting the service, but this doesn't seem a reliable way
to test that the bridge is still working after a few days.
If no nagios, can anyone recommend a general command-line strategy for
building an automated test to check that a bridge relay is up and running?
