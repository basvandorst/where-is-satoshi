Hi all,
All of the above provide useful information for the first-time tor user. But
the last two are only really meaningful to initates (and probably confusing to everyone else), while the first is reassuring but could really offer a little more.
What is needed (IMVHO) is a page that confirms you are using tor
successfully, but also introduces you to the other services that tor offers and also some advice for the tor debutante. A sort of official or unofficial 'welcome to the tor network' page. This could be linked to in the FAQ/INSTALL and used
by Would the maintainers of any of the above be interested in providing such a thing? Given that the heavy lifting has already been done on all of the above, it would be very trivial to create. Would there be an appetite for such a thing on the tor homepage itself?
Suggestions for content:
* A warm greeting!
* Top Five things all tor users should know
* Appeal for users to run servers and link to how-to
* An introduction to some hidden services
Anyway, just a thought...

I'm the owner of a large *public* news server (see  )  which allows a (restricted)  read and write access to USENET groups without requiring an authentication. I'm also a novice with Tor. An increasing
number of tor users is choosing my server for reading and posting on USENET. In order to avoid SYN DDOS and floods, my server accepts only a determinate number of daily connections and bytes per IP. Trespassers are banned for a day. While a single (end) proxy serves a single client the total activity generated on my host by that tor router usually remains under this limit. When more than a client uses the same proxy, often that tor router exceeds those values because the barrier is calibrated assuming a single client per IP. Every IP can also post only 25 messages per day which is a reasonable limit for a single client but it isn't enough when multiple users share the same IP.
Therefore sometimes some tor proxy is banned from my server due an excessive
number of connections, bytes or posts.
I need a (server side) way to separate the tor users from the other ones: is
this possible?
I'm supposing to setup an "hidden service" which redirects all tor users to
a non default *local* NNTP port in order to treat them differently from the other clients. In this way, when the tor users access the server from the main DNS system (as nntp.aioe.org) they're still subjected to the standard rules that are applied to all clients but when they use the .onion domain a different (less restrictive) policy can be applied to them.  Is this a right
way? If so, does tor allow to be configured in order to handle only my "hidden service" without providing any other tor service (my ISP doesn't like proxy and i've not much bandwidth)?

pickaproxy.com and geospoofing.com will be offering this functionality as a
server-side service - you will be able to choose an exit node in
country/state/city/ISP/Org so that the server can then setup a long-lived
Tor circuit for you - you will then be advised on how to configure your
workstation proxy settings, with regard to port number and domain/host name.
This does not require you to install Tor on your machine, or to upgrade it
when new versions come around.  Nor will Vidalia or Privoxy be required on
the workstation.
We will offer options to use stunnel or OpenVPN connections to our server
(your proxy).  And we're looking at using polipo (on the server) to speed
things up.
We have multiple sources of geolocation data so they will be more accurate
than the open source GeoIP library - we pay for them where the license
requires us to.

As Jonathan Yu pointed out there is no particularly reliable method for choosing by country, geoip is the closest match out there.
TorK uses geoip to offer a 'Citizen Of' feature, where you choose the
country you want to 'browse the internet from', i.e. use exitnodes from only that country.

You are correct - this is not just to be a commercial service.
We do not intend to offer a completely anonymous service, but rather to
extend the existing usefulness of Tor to more users and to provide
functionality which we are always being asked about - namely how to spoof
being in a particular geographic location.
We will make it as clear as we can where anonymity can be compromised or
exposed, much as Tor already does on it's download page.
Our server(s) will function as an entry point to the Tor network, but if we
can find a way to afford to scale it then we will distribute these to
various locations so there will be multiple and (relatively) randomly
selected servers and port numbers.
The use of polipo will be optional - again we will make everyone aware of
it's implications.  I have seen how it improves the speed and responsiveness
of using Tor, so would like to make that available to people who want it.
Basically we see that not everyone needs or wants 100% anonymity, and we do
not intend to only target that market.  In fact, is it even possible
anywhere with anything right now?
We're also listening to what our users want, so welcome comments and cat
calls :)

Hi Wesley -
I'm going to presume that your email isn't advertising a commercial service,
which I'd certainly find to be in dubious taste, both from the standpoint of
inappropriate advertising, and from the moral standpoint of profiting from
the goodwill of others.
However - could you say a word-or-five about the privacy and anonymity
implications of connecting directly to your well known site, and then asking
for a specific exit node?
It seems to me that you're not only encouraging people to make highly
identifiable connections to a single location (stunnel or OpenVPN to your
servers), which would then be an excellent target for compromising anonymity
- but you're also then encouraging people to reduce their anonymity by
selecting extremely specific exit nodes, making it again, easier to identify
and target them.
I note that you're saying that Vidalia and Privoxy won't be required - is
your plan to run all of the user traffic through your server, and then
through the Tor network?
A comment on the implications of using a caching web proxy for Tor users on
your server would be interesting as well.

Hi folks,
I just added a new item to   Sometimes Tor servers crash, or the computers they're on fall off the
  network, or other accidents happen. Some Tor operators have expressed
  an interest in signing up to a "notifying" service that periodically
  checks whether their Tor server is healthy and sends them a reminder
  mail when it's not. Anybody want to write a few cgi scripts, a few web
  pages, and set up some sort of wget hack and/or something more complex
  like Nagios to do the monitoring? The
  first version could check just the directory port, e.g. looking through
  the cached network-status page for the right IP address and port and
  then asking for the "/tor/server/authority" page.
Perhaps somebody here (or a group of somebodies) wants to tackle this?

I understand the part about running squid on localhost and routing web

then into tor.
But how can I route Tor client through localhost proxy? Tor client has to
make an encrypted connection to Tor entry node. Do you mean putting squid in
the middle of that encrypted connection? How would you do that?
Plus, that will only filter the entry nodes by country. But I want to avoid
EXIT nodes from certain countries. The entry nodes do not see my traffic, so
I don't really care about them. However the exit nodes can see all my
traffic in clear text, so it's the exit nodes that I want to filter by

I think you could make a case for trusting 1 or a handful of exit nodes, and
use ExitNodes abc and StrictExitNodes 1 to make sure you only use those for
sensitive authentication connections like you are asking about.
For example, do you think blutmagie is sniffing?  When it is trusted as a V2
and Hidden Service Directory Authority?
Or BostonUCompSci?  It would be kind of embarrassing to Boston University
wouldn't it, if they were found to be sniffing?
It is probably too much to expect at this point, though, that a list of
trusted exit nodes will be publicly compiled.  I think you have to do your
own investigations and come up with your own list.

I get pretty much the same from my cached-consensus as well.  I got my 407

the cloud from one of the directory authorities?  Does it get read from the

I have recently been doing some timings of the controller interface, and
find that on average I can get a response to one of these GETINFO commands
in less than 0.06 seconds, and sometimes in as little as 0.0001 seconds.
However there are times when it takes up to 20+ seconds to get this same

Thanks, Roger.
I am not sure which condition applies, but will do some further tests.  My
best guess is that I have to sometimes wait 20 seconds to get an answer.  If
the Tor process is reading data from the local cache then perhaps the server
is too busy to get to this file read right away (I am dealing with sometimes
very heavy server loads).

directories; 500 running, not hibernating, valid not bad version 2
directories; 32 KB/s mean and average exit bandwidth; and 40 KB/s mean and
average relay bandwidth. "Use With Caution" is defined to mean there are less than 1 or more of these

directories, 250 version 2 directories, 22 KB/s mean and average exit

If I set "BridgeRelay" for my Tor server to 1, then must I have an
"ExitPolicy" to accept at least 1 port or 1 IP address/range?  If ExitPolicy
is reject *:* does this mean the bridge relay will not work?  And if I have
multiple ports accepted, will any of them be used for the bridge

that I will be recognized by some or all "UseBridges" Tor clients as a
bridge authority?  I understand that "UseBridges" Tor clients will not know
about all bridge authorities, so what is the cut off for those known and not
known?  Is there a manual list kept somewhere, or must Tor clients
personally know about bridge authorities they can use?  I see that the
