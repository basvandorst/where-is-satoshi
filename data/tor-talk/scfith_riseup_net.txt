Just my 2 cents, if you move to something like github's "latest" binary releases approach for projects, it works really well. I do that for a few of mine and it works great. As simple as a latest.zip that is them most recent version binary for Linux, OSX, & Windows.

Can't you just buy a new machine with cash, and then make sure to never let it out of your site? What your describing would only happen if they have physical access to your machine to install ANT in the bios. Probably naive here, but I don't think that every machine made is already owned by the powers that be.

For all we know, you, William, sir, could be actually working for them as a way to identify who knows what about when to help target the next wave before they become problems to the new intrusion sets being developed. If you weren't the  target then what would you be doing? Your answers to that are what I would actually be doing instead of spending too much time worrying. If you were an actual threat you would have been taken out via drone, short-RNA gene-specific poison, or other horrible thing. Instead you are still hear and free to continue to post here. I stand by my recommendations as a first step and to get you some comms that aren't already compromised. Or do what mr. torvalds does and actually stay offline except using other people's machines or in libraries, Apple stores, etc.

First, not sure why you want to list .onion domains. The key here is that they are HIDDEN services. But I am sure you have reasons.
Second, if you do list .onion domains, know that they will be collected.
Third, provide a simple path of machine-readable content to download so that bots won’t kill your server, like a list.json file that is up to date so your server is not ruined.
my 2 cents.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Warning: 37 new booby trapped onion sites 
Is there anyway to somehow automate the process? (The developer in me coming out)
I ask because this seems like something that you will be doing perpetually. Something like an algorithm that can compare percentage match of heuristics of a database of previous sites marked as fake against all new ones and then giving a trust score? I'd be happy to help write something in Python to do this & put on github, assuming I can get a decent sets of sample data to test against. Or would putting it out there publically allow those creating the fake sites to up their game and change their tactics. Seems like this will always be a cat & mouse game.

Here is the exact link:  it jumped from 40000 to 60000 in the past day or two. Since the metrics are based on the number of relays acting as hidden services with the assumption that at least 1% are reporting in, the numbers are correlated directly with the number of relays running as well.

I believe the Internet is a misinformation machine. I don't think the solution is to somehow stop the tide, which would be impossible or only piecemeal (managing to answer every question on Quora). The best you can do is have the correct and complete information on virtual properties you own, like the Tor project website. People who seek answers will hopefully go to the source instead of intermediaries.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is it possible to use Tor without showing a Tor IP 
I can point you in a direction that I took to accomplish this without having to resort to a third party VPN. I am running my own VPN from a VPS and added it to my proxychains file. Here is the github for proxychains-ng that I highly recommend. This setup accomplishes what you ask, a list of ip addresses that it chains through to the final destination. Your tor connection can be one of them or not as you wish. Enjoy.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is it possible to use Tor without showing a Tor IP 
Mr. Andersson is assuming a lot. There are definitely tried and true methods to make purchases online and setup identities for these types of things. At the end of the day, yes the VPS provider is the weakest link. But you can use one that has no logs, carries a warrant canary, etc. and you can burn your VPS IP address as often as you need or spin up new ones as often as you need too. This is just one of many approaches and requires you to know what you are doing in locking down the VPS besides knowing how to buy it the right way, etc.

Now the spike is up to over 80000 domains. The Tor Project has had more than a few days now to analyze this, any update or feedback regarding what these appear to be beyond "we need to wait and see." Personally, I think it is, in fact, Ricochet.

@_subject: [tor-talk] using a VPN, 
I've tested for research purposes running both proxychains and openvpn setups using 2-3 VPSs with private ip addresses from bolt vm for really cheap per month. Worked really well as an alternative to using Tor. Question, If you run your own relays couldn't you just force your host to connect to your relays only, thus ensuring that you won't randomly hit a malicious exit or be de-anon by nefarious actor? Yes this assumes you have a guard and exit relay running as well, but still wondering the security of that versus other setups.

It _would_ be the same private key. Good luck with generating 1.2 septillion permutations (16^32). But could be doable in a few years so to answer your question, I believe there can only be one published in the HSDIR, so first come first served. Facebook's would have to be DDOS / shutdown and then the forged one can be spun up and published. Please correct me if I'm wrong as I've only been researching Tor since 2015.

I'm pretty sure that the onion address is generated directly from the private key, at least if you have every played around with scallion or eschalot. So what you just wrote doesn't apply in that way. But again, I could be wrong.

You are right. 32^16 which is 1.2 septillion (24 zeros). That's the total number of possible .onion addresses at the current base32 format.

You are already using protonmail, so you are already a shill. Electronic devices leave signatures and vulnerable to collection & traffic analysis. I would suggest removing all electronics from your residence and relaxing for a while. Take a break as you say, all systems have flaws. Rely on PGP for security in your own private keys and do not trust anything or anyone else.
