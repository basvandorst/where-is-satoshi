@_subject: [tor-talk] Improved sharing of .onion links on Facebook! 
I really wonder what is facebook doing with tor!
They offer an entry page at Every time I tried to signup, thay block the process until I submit a phone number to get a "confirmation sms"!
Moreover, trying to enter a FB account opened "normally" (without proxy), no way! They even blocked my account immediately :)
What is the interest offering to use TOR?!

Well, my account "blocked" means that they asked me an official DOCUMENT! As Photoshop is a good friend, no problem, but...
Something else we tested on FB: They quite often ask people to "upload a photo" (of them), until what the account is blocked. We noticed that:
If we send a picture picked up on FB profiles (other persons so, even from other countries etc), it is always declined and the account IS locked for good.
If we send the same picture but with modifications (photoshop again), it is generally accepted and the account is unlocked.
It seems, so, that FB is comparing the submitted photo with the photos that have already been uploaded. MD5 has or more probably something more Considering this and the FB reputation about privacy violations, I even suspect that they are making lists of people using TOR! In short, better connect from a public place with a spoofed MAC address ;)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor in Russia, blocked from Nov 1st? 
Seems that TOR will be blocked from Nov 1st in Russia. Any info on this? In such a case, will it be possible to use Tor through "bridges"?
Thank you!

Well, seems quite easy to get the bridges IPs every 10 minutes and to block them...

@_subject: [tor-talk] Onion website on "usual" server 
I am running a dedicated box (Centos 7-64) with a few usual domains and Is it possible to host an .onion website there? If so, how to setup, is it safe (so that the .onion site IP won't be disclosed)?
Thank you!

@_subject: [tor-talk] TOR problem with onion service setup 
I want to setup an onion service on a VPS. For this I installed a fresh Centos6 copy, replaced Apache by Nginx, got TOR from Epel repo.
As long that I simply run Tor, all is right. But when I modify the tor.rc to setup an onion service, problems begin.
In tor.rc I unchecked the lines
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
# service tor restart
Checking if tor configuration is validMay 15 19:01:11.001 [notice] Tor 0.2.9.17 (git-e057a19b74589fca) running on Linux with Libevent 2.0.21-stable, OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips and Zlib 1.2.3.

May 15 19:01:11.007 [err] Reading config failed--see warnings above.
To solve the $HOME point I uncommented the line
 /var/lib/tor
But so, remains the problem of

May 15 19:01:11.007 [warn] Checking service directory May 15 19:01:11.007 [warn] Failed to parse/validate config: Failed to configure rendezvous options. See logs for details.
I looked online and found a few "solutions", none of them work (changing ownership and permissions of the /var/lib/tor/*, setting a completely different directory in /var/, etc etc)
  Any help would be welcome, thank you!
