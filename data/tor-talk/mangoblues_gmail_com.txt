@_subject: Torbutton 1.1.8-alpha (Usability improvements) 
Could you please also make it compatible with Thunderbird ?
Torbutton 1.4 installs (and works) fine with Thunderbird after editing the config file in the xpi package to allow Thunderbird to install it.
I suppose it should works as well with the new version ?

@_subject: 3 questions about how to setup TOR proxy chain 
Could someone please answer these 3 questions (or point me to a place
where I can find the answers):
1. I understand TOR uses 3 hops in its proxy chain. Is it possible to
make it use less hops (i.ex: 1 or 2) or more hops (4, 5, ...) and how
can I do this?
2. Is it possible to define the nodes to use, so that TOR will only use
these nodes in the chain and no other (i.ex: select 50 nodes, and TOR
will randomly chose 3 nodes out of these 50 and not use the 1500 other
3. To add on point 2 above, is it possible to "statically" select 3
nodes (i.ex 2 middle nodes + 1 exit") and only use these 3? (I know
about the anonymity problems this may create, I'd only like to know if
it is possible and how to do it).
PS: I have already searched, and could only find some answers on how to
select the exit node (.exit), but not on how to configure the proxy chain.
Thanks a lot.

@_subject: polipo problems 
As polipo has now replaced privoxy in the default tor setup I am trying to use it, but it doesn't work.
Could someone please help me do these 2 things:
1. Run polipo as a windows 2003 service.
Everytime I try to start polipo as a service it crashes. I tried to set daemonise=true in the config, but this doesn't help (I have searched the web and the polipo manual, I found no other info on how to do this). Privoxy works fine as a service, why is polipo such a headache?
2. Add this proxy functionality I have with privoxy to the polipo config:
(I see the tor socks is already set in the polipo config)
If someone can help me out with this I could finaly move everything to
