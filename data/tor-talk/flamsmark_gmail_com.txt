you think is the next logical step to improving Tor. However, remember the
version number: 0.2.1.*. Tor is not a 'finished' piece of software. It is
not feature-complete; it does not implement everything that's either desired
or required for ideal use. However, right now, much of the development
effort is not spent making it easier for clients to use. There's a feeling
that it's currently 'good enough' that those who really need to use Tor will
be able to follow the instructions and get it working. If you don't agree
with that emphasis, again, it's your prerogative to build those feature that
you think are most important.

'Widespread adoption' is not the current sort-term aim. While we all think
that fast, universal, anonymous internet access would be a good thing, we
simply can't support that right now. The volunteer network of relays isn't
that big. Even now, Tor has trouble dealing with the network load. If Tor
were to become more popular with users, without seeing a commensurate
increase in the relay capacity, that would massively reduce the
functionality of the network. Right now, It's important to make
tor available for the most at-risk users: those in oppressive
regimes, whistle-blowers,  undercover journalists and so on. After that, the
priority is on improving the structure of the system, not on further
While I can see where you're coming from in suggesting that a kernel driver
is better, the reality is more complex. Because the primary development
effort is on the core Tor software, a VM requires a relatively small
development effort at present. One barely even needs to be able to code to
construct a VM that uses existing software: it's mostly an exercise in
implementing best-practices. Moreover, a VM is actually easier to support
right now than a driver. A driver would need a coder dedicated to
maintaining it. A VM on the other hand needs only a geek, and can easily
update to the latest versions of Tor (and supporting applications) when they
are released.

Tor may not provide the desired level of anonymity. There are other  privacy

@_subject: External Relay Control [maintaining 'uptime' perception] 
Tor currently has an accounting system for allowing data quota limitations
to be applied. This allows a relay to enter 'hibernation', maintaining it's
'up' status, and directory-perceived uptime, without actually relaying
traffic. However, it is feasible that an operator might want to control Tor
for bandwidth reasons, but not use the built-in accounting system. The relay
might share a connection with other applications, and have to change it
connection profile relative to them.
Possible actions that might be desired include:- changing bandwidth limits,
- changing between an exit and a relay,
- switching the relay on or off, or
- suspending dirport operation.
Possible conditions giving rise to such needs include:
- a periodic quota is reached (since other applications are sharing the
connection, Tor can't be aware of when this limit might be reached), or
- another application requires a greater share of the connection
Most of these behaviors are scriptable without difficulty by editing the
torrc and sending Tor a sighup. In most cases, this is not a problem.
However, when relaying must be suspended - and this suspension is not
conducted via the built-in accounting system - the relay is unlisted from
directories. Since uptime is used as an index for many of the
classifications applied to relays (naming &c), this has a notable effect on
the relay's 'profile' in the network, and the way that clients perceive it.
Presumably, this is not a desirable situation.
Is there a good workaround for this?

I don't want to weigh in on the more substantive issues here, but I do think
that this specific question can be answered without too much difficulty.
For those who require a lower level of anonymity than that which Tor
provides, but choose to use Tor anyway, Tor's poor performance is probably a
major complaint. If they had the opportunity to change a setting from 'high
security' to `one-hop proxy', and got better performance from the latter, I
think that many of this group would change that setting. This would make Tor
more useful to them, and decrease the network load per person in this group.
This is not to say that more use wouldn't immediately crop up to fill this
gap, nor that more `one hop' users wouldn't start using Tor likewise. I
don't want to say whether building one-hop functionality is a good idea, but
I certainly think that some people would use it.

If you limit yourself to a small set of nodes, you
will definitely compromise your anonymity against a powerful attacker. But
what if you're not worried about a powerful attacker, or serious anonymity?
What if you just want a casual observer to think you're using Tor, and leave
it at that?
You could run two relays on each node you control. One relay would be part
of the public tor network, and limit the bandwidth to a (large) fraction of
what you have available. One relay would be part of your private tor network
and use the rest of the available bandwidth. You'd have to bootstrap your
tor network from scratch, and set up an authority, and so on. Then you could
run your local tor client on your private network, and have a small set of
fast nodes available to you. A casual observer at either end (you-hop1 or
hop3-internet) would see the traffic from/to a tor node, and assume that it
was truly torified. Depending what you personally think the threat profile
is - and I'd suggest reading some of the research to find out what threats
to consider - you might want to use an entry point or exit node on the
regular network, or do other circuit manipulation.
Note that trying to take advantage of your own resources inevitably limits
your anonymity potential. Customizing your network also means that you won't
benefit as much, or at all, from upgrades to Tor. However, if all you want
is casually anonymous browsing at high speed, this may be useful to you.
Nonetheless, I make no guarantees that the system you set up will be
sufficiently anonymous for you.

be the ideal behaviour. If Mallory lists all the nodes in the network, then
this should prevent all the paths which have Mallory somewhere in them, but
not paths which avoid her entirely. An aggressive family declaration by
Mallory only prevents her from getting traffic, without impacting the rest
of the network.This would seem to be the only sensible way to implement
``one-sided family declarations'', to prevent exactly the problem described.

I seem to recall that something called haystack, with a remarkably similar
webpage was the software and donations portal developed by during the Iran election. Since Heap's twitter is still linked from the
haystacknetworkcom page, I assume that this project remains the offspring of
that effort. I can't comment directly, but I recall that the effort seemed
pretty legitimate at that time. I assume that it's still legitimate, even if
not free software in the strictest sense. The Censorship Research Center is
San Francisco non-profit, started by Heap. They do have a contact form on
their about page: While I think that free (as in speech as in Stallman) software is the best
way to go, I can understand why someone of good intentions might think
otherwise. I reckon that haystack is not a malicious honeypot, or cynical
effort to relive people of their cash. However, I do think that the project
may not be overly successful, and that donations would do more good

Is there a page on the wiki that contains suggested families? It's great
that we have people like Scott to find these families, and it's great that
he sends them out to the list. However, new users, new subscribers to the
list, and so on will have difficulty accessing them. The list archives are
quite hard to browse, and it would make sense to have this info in one
place. Scott, could you start a page with this info?

Does this mean that the modified FF4 & associated add-ons will be available
in the Tor repository?
If so, will the packages be custom-named, or will they fill the current
Firefox/Iceweasel dependencies for other programs?
Will the patched version ship with the FF branding?

Hash: SHA256
My name is Thomas Lowenthal, and I'm and undergraduate student at Princeton
University. I'm majoring in the Politics Department, with a
certificate from the
Program in Applications of Computing, and the Program in Information Technology
and Society. I'm also an Undergraduate Fellow at Princeton's Center for
Information Technology Policy[1]. I'll be graduating this summer, in 2011.
I run the exit TempleSouth[2] inside the IP space of Princeton University. The
computer itself isn't a departmental or University piece of equipment, it's
just my own machine that lives under my desk. Over time, it's had different
names and fingerprints, as I moved from machine to machine, and operating
system to operating system. Running an exit node here has been a lot of work,
but it's been extremely interesting to see the reactions that different
administrators here have had.
I run a Tor exit node because I support the ubiquitous availability of strong
anonymity for anyone who wants it. Tor is one of the strongest, best-
researched, and most widely-used online anonymity system, and I want to help
keep it running at maximum capacity.
Initially, I operated a relay but -- not one to shy away from a fight --
reviewed the EFF's legal guidance, and switched to an exit node. This was in
the days before Mike Perry's excellent /Tips for Running and Exit Node with
Minimal Harassment/[3], and I used a wide open exit policy. Of course, after
a little while some DMCA complaints started showing up. I responded with polite
and precise variations on the abuse templates. However, Princeton has a policy
of assuming the accuracy of such notices, and that they refer to actually
illegal behavior. I was sanctioned on the basis that I was personally violating
copyright law. Of course, I argued back.
I gradually made my way through different administrative procedures, talking
with several administrators, and committees, and finally Princeton's general
counsel. It took a few years (and untold meetings) but I've managed to persuade
them that running an exit node is neither illegal nor unethical (if not
actively altruistic). The most interesting part has been the reactions from the
various people involved in the the discipline/discussion process.
The first few administrators, and the committee that sanctioned me to begin
with, were completely incredulous that this whole Tor business could be
anything but an elaborate ploy to download movies and music online. It was
beyond imagining that a message sent by -- highly reputable -- entertainment
companies could be anything but cold hard fact: prima facie evidence of
wrongdoing. I had to pull out Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act[4]
and subtly hint that sanctioning me might be illegal itself, before they'd
consider seeking a second opinion on my "wrongdoing".
Our DMCA contact was much more pragmatic, and genuinely interested in what was
going on. She went out and did her homework on the Tor project, examining things
with a non-judgemental eye. She empathized with my desire to work towards
internet freedom. Her concerns were pragmatic and legal. Se was worried that I
could move towards giving the University a bad name, or causing it actual harm.
She was also skeptical that I -- a student with a home-made computer under my
desk -- could be considered a "service provider" in the eyes of the DMCA,
especially since I hadn't registered a DMCA contact.
However, the school's general counsel was the most understanding. After I
explained to him exactly how Tor works, and we reviewed the safe harbor
provisions of the DMCA, he got on board with the EFF's legal position. He also
realized that this left the University with negligible liability for what was
going on, and that -- on the contrary -- it was only sanctioning me that would
raise the legal risk under the CDA.
The support that I received from the project was somewhat limited, but I can't
really imagine receiving that much more. I spoke with arma on the IRC channel,
and he provided me with moral support, and offered to get me in touch with Ed
Felten at Princeton's CITP. An open letter from lawyers, addressing an ISP or
University's liability concerns might be valuable, but then again it might not.
It's my feeling that this sort of situation is best resolved with polite
determination and some mild politicking, but I don't see that there's much that
the Tor project can do to persuade large organizations of its worth.
The most valuable resource that I have right now is Mike Perry's excellent
sort of thing that's really valuable to people like me. I'd like it to be
linked directly from 'so you want to be a server' section of the
torproject.org .
Beyond that, the most valuable thing for the project to do is
advocacy. The more
people know about Tor, and respect the value of online anonymity, the easier
people should find it to run exits
That's the position as it currently stands. I think that the University is not
happy, per se, but that they realize that running a Tor node is one of the many
forms of autonomy that must be granted in a liberal academic institution. There
are still blips from time to time when it seems that someone has made a death
threat, or committed a criminal offense while exiting from my node. Mostly,
however, the University just lives and lets live.

A note: Princeton is home to the Center for Information Technology Policy,
directed by Professor Ed Felten, my Computer Science adviser. CITP is home to
research fellows, including Wendy Seltzer, one of Tor's Board of Directors, and
has even had Roger Dingledine visit as a guest speaker. If needed, it's possible
that I could have requested backup, or reinforcements from CITP during the saga
described above, however I preferred to fight this one on my own, as far as
