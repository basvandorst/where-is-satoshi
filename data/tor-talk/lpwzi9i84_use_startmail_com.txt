@_subject: [tor-talk] Typo - German Tor-Browser 
im no familiar with bugreport and things. I just wanted to report a typo in German Torbrowser:
"Tor Status" Info-Window on Browser-Start, connection process
it says "Mit dem Tor-Netzwerk wird verbinden"
it should of cause be "verbunden"
please someone report or fix (: thanks

Apple is known for its proprietary. So you will not know for shure what your os is sending home. You can use a Tor-Proxy for instance on raspi to send principially all your traffic trough tor, but you probably will be deanonyized prinzipially by the information that will be send through. I think best way will be?simply booting tails.
