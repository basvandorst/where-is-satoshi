A guess is that there might be a link between the bridges
enumeration attack mentioned in that article and the recent spike
in bridge use, for which one of the hypotheses was a botnet
Creating many circuits through the bridges is a way to make them
visible to a large proportion of relays, including potentially
malicious ones.
A possible countermeasure might be something similar to the
"Entry Guards" mechanism for circuits that go though bridges.
