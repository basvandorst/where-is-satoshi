I do like Tor Browser, but I'd like to know why the Tor Browser places me (according to Google) everywhere except where I am actually located? I am in central Arizona, but every time I open Tor Browser my start page ( changes to various other countries, ie: sometimes Italy, Netherlands, Germany, etc. but never USA! I would like to see Tor Browser open and load my home page(s) as I prefer all the time!

I played with it a tad and see that ( does work although at the bottom right of the page it gives the option to use  instead. Minor annoyance. IF it eventually works like Firefox it should be nice! I'm just an end user and not a programmer/tech. Still wondering the advantage of Tor over Firefox. Also wondering what if someone never installed Firefox before. Will Tor still work or function?
