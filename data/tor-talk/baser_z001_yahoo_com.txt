@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Bundle Suggestion 
I would like to point out that:
"Since Firefox 4, the Add-ons Manager displays additional information about each add-on you have installed, including screenshots, description, ratings, downloads, Contributions, and other metadata. In order to keep this information updated, Firefox will ask the Mozilla Add-ons gallery for information about the add-ons you have installed once a day. This involves sending the identifiers of each add-on you have installed to Mozilla, as well as information on how long it last took Firefox to start up.
The add-on identifiers are used to return updated information to you, as well as in aggregate to provide personalized recommendations in the Get Add-ons pane of the Add-ons Manager. Start-up time information is used to improve Firefox and identify add-ons that may be causing Firefox to be slow. This data is collected as described in the Mozilla Firefox Privacy Policy."
This is a flaw in the Tor Browser Bundle.
By default this is enabled in the Tor Browser Bundle.
Full detail and instructions to disable this is given on:
This feature should be disabled by default in  the Tor Browser Bundle to further protect users' privacy
