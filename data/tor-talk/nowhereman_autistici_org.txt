@_subject: [tor-talk] Identify requests made by the same user 
Hello all,
i've ran trough your docs, without finding a complete answer. If my question is covered by a FAQ or something like that, please don't hesitate to "RTFM" me :)
The point: does a tor client have a kind of "unique ID" in the network? I mean, let's put 2 users create 2 hidden services, completely unrelated between them, under 2 different .onion domains. Then, I set up my tor client and use both hidden services. Is someway possible to know that those 2 requests have been made by me (by my tor client, as my IP and identity is completely hidden)?
Hope you understand what I mean. A practical example would be:
I go to the aaa.onion forum and describe my plan to kill Obama. I'm completely anonymous. Then, from the same Tor client, I open bbb.onion, and comment on a post giving my home address. If the client had an unique id, it would be possible to associate those 2 actions. You don't know what is the IP address of that client, or where is it, but you actually know that the post on aaa.onion and comment on bbb.onion have been written by the same person (actually, "from the same client").

I've read the entire FAQ page! :)
Yes, I know that. What i'd like to know, is if it's the same from the client point of view.
Yes yes yes. That's clear. Tor encrypts my connections, but I have to be careful on what I (and my browser) send over the internet. This is application and physical transport level. What makes me think is the tor transport level (the payload of tcp/udp packets tor sends over the My question wasn't actually related to a specific application. This is my reasoning: in order to get the server response back to me, the encrypted packet Tor sends over the network, should contain and identifier of my Tor client. This way the .onion service can read the request, prepare a response and send it back to me. Just like a TCP packet that contains the sender's IP address (Tor's TCP packet will contain the IP of the last node on the tunnel, but at an higher level there should be my client ID).
I'm speaking about a kind of "internal ip", some internal identifier in the Tor network. Let's put aaa.onion is an IRC chat and ccc.onion is a bulletin board. And that from the same client come 2 different requests for aaa.onion and ccc.onion. From the application layer, knowing that they come from the same client, is impossible. But, Tor should someway know that both responses will be forwarded to the same client, thus making possible to "group" them and know that behind them there is the same user.
I've read much technical documentation, but looks like this point is not properly described. I should read Tor's code, but I can't manage to do Thankyou all

Hmmm, ok. What I actually can't understand is: when contacting an hidden service, the message for it gets encrypted using its public key. And some other security layers, ok, but the message uses the HS public key.
The response, should work the same way, no? I mean: the hidden service encrypts the response using the client's key, so it knows that. The HS actually know the client's key: it can't correlate the key with a location, an ip address or a name, but this can be exploited so that 2 different hidden service's administrators could actually know that request X on hidden service A and request Y on hidden service B has been made from the same client (as the responses have been encrypted with the same public key).
Can't understand where i'm wrong. As I hope to be wrong.
