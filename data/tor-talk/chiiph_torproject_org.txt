Only if it breaks something or if it conflicts with something.
If you use ControlPort auto, Vidalia needs to find out what port should
it listen to (since it's random). To do that, it reads a file that tor
writes. The location of this file is specified with the config option
ControlPortWriteToFile, and that's why Vidalia adds it.
It doesn't have to do with bridges, Vidalia uses that configuration and
it gets written to your torrc because you open the settings dialog and
save at some point. That's because of how Vidalia works underneath.
Hope this clarifies the issue.
