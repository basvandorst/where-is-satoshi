I have brought the exitpolicy list up to date to follow with the conversations, if you want to be moderately restrictive.
Of course this isn't blocking the kazaa, azureus etc data from entering the network and slowing us down, only passing the buck. Is there a more effective way to keep unwanted data from entering the network at all?

I was reading some of the archive on routing through your own machine

leaves your own machine sounds advantageous. However I am encountering
a problem. When i config my entrynode to by my own server, i see
errors in the log of "add_nickname_list_to_smartlist(): Nichname list
includes 'arrakis' which is known but down." So it appears that Tor
refuses to let me use my own server. When I set it for strict policy
the error logs go crazy and tor pukes.
Is the way I am doing it working, and only occaisonally reporting an error? Is there a better solution to be able to make it strict?

If IRC is used for botnet control, and Tor is used for IRC, then it
follows that people can easily be using Tor for botnet control.
Whether they are or not, we do not know, but even this is irrelevant
as we cannot and would not want to analyze all data.
The question, I think, comes down to if you want to restrict IRC based
on a possible threat. Will you wait till someone does something wrong
and the ISP shuts down your server? Is it likely to happen? And when
it does happen, at that point will you change your policy to get back
online, or will your ISP roll over for Tor, or will you have to get a
new ISP? Do you have warm or cold feelings about IRC? Will restricting
IRC ports actually stop most negative IRC traffic?
Unless you like IRC, or see closing the ports as pointless, or would
be willing to change your ISP, or the ISP will let abusive Tor servers
operate, you should change your setting to restrict such access by

Absolutely you can have multiple Torparks on your computer. Since they

And in order to install extensions, in the address bar type
"about:config" and hit enter. Find xpinstall.enabled, and set it to
True. You might also have to change your cache size from 0 to say
10MB, then when it is isntalled, turn the cache back to 0.

The  idea  is that the circuit coordination is distributed among three
layers.  The  first  tier  recieves  info  from  the Tor server saying
"hello,  I'm alive. Add me to the ultimate list". The second tier gets
regional  lists from the first tier, so nobody but tier 1 has a global
view. The third tier is the one that gets a request from the tor user,
specifying what kind of circuits it wants (fastest, country avoidance,
specific  servers, whatever) which queries the second tier as to which
might  be  the best nodes available to the request, to which the third
tier  then  calculates the possible circuits, and gives one to the tor
user at random.
What  happens if tier one is compromised? Everyone gets busted, unless
the Tor program itself has a way to authenticate if the first tier has
authority  and  a  true  identity.  And  naturally  there  is internal
verification of Tier 1, 2, and 3.

Hello fellow tor-nerds,
This was mentioned to me last week. It was suggested to me to
implement Torpark as a Firefox plugin.
Well, I don't think that would work since Torpark is designed to be
stand-alone and mobile.
But tell you what, if we fitted Tor to be a firefox XPI/extension it
sure would be the most popular Firefox plugin ever.
What if we created a Firefox plugin for just Tor, and it allowed
Firefox users to configure their level of involvement (using firefox
extension as the GUI). They could set if they were just rendezvous/man
middle, or even if they wanted to let their machine be an exit node,
and of course plug their browser into Tor directly (thanks to firefox
1.5 and later). All from a simple firefox extention.
This would be an excellent solution to bandwidth issues, an bring a
new level of global involvement for Tor server presence.
What do you think?

No no. I mean how routers propagate routes and know paths. Inherently,

Okay. So I take it y'all like the idea.
Matt, as default, I think we should make the extension just implement
man in the middle. You can turn on and off anonymity, and you can also
turn on and off exit node. You can turn on/off really anything.
But this would certainly bring Tor to a whole new level.
Alright, I'm done talking about it's possibilities.
How would it affect the Tor network to suddenly have 500,000 man in
the middle servers pop up? Dir servers would clog? Does this mean we
need a new protocol for directory sending, or a new protocol for
directory structure whatever? So now we need to read that paper that
was posted, and figure out why we can't use a few trusted servers to
propagate network directories and virtual regions. And at the same
time we need to get busy writing an XPI to run tor, whatever version
we decide to stick in.
Who can do this? Surely there must be some brilliant programmers out
there who can program this XPI in a couple days and cases of Jolt.

Torpark  is  great  on the DNS issue. This was one of the main reasons
for creating it.
Torpark has incorporated versions of Firefox which have internal SOCKS
proxies,  and are capable of remote dns functions, so there is no need
for privoxy. Essentially the browser can loopback all the data through
its SOCKS proxy and route it through TOR without the need for privoxy.
Torpark  doesn't  strip DNS information like privoxy does, but instead
remotely  routes  the  request  so it doesn't appear that the query is
coming from that machine (thank you Deer Park Alpha).
I haven't compared Tor+Privoxy+Browser vs. Torpark (Tor + Browser) but
I  would  imagine the results are negligible. Anyone care to run speed

Hello everyone,
Torpark  has  become  a little too popular, so now I am running out of
throughput  on my host since the demand has reached 7 Gigs per day. If
anyone is capable of offering download mirror space, I would VERY much
appreciate it ASAP!

Well,  I've  been reading they board they are talking about it on, and
1/5  seem  to  say  it doesn't work, 2/3rds say it is slow. Begger and
chosers, well whatever. As soon as we all get off our ass and kill the
bittorrent  traffics  and  get  their  bittor  clients  to  become tor
servers, then we will have something.

Torpark v1.0
Prerelease download address:
Everyone feel free to try it out and let me know what you
think within the next few hours. This one requires that
you run torkill, which will kill all of the silent processes
associated with Torpark v1.0., essentially tor.exe if you've
already closed the browser.
What silent processes? tor.exe mainly. but running torkill
will kill any process named tor.exe, torpark.exe, and
firefox.exe. Under win32 of course.
* tor.exe now starts as a silent process, no DOS box. All you
get is the browser, which has been customized.
* No more worries about a prior running firefox, any process
named firefox.exe will be killed prior to torpark running.
* PDF Download extension automatically integrated
* Firesomething extension automatically integrated
* Available in a bazillion languages, except Farsi
* Upgraded icons
* Self extracting archive, yet smaller than before.
* Built around Firefox 1.5 RC1 and Tor 0.1.1.8a
LET ME KNOW WHAT BUGS YOU ENCOUNTER ASAP.

I don't think firesomething changed the process name.
The  difference  with this is when you first run torpark, it will kill
any  process  already  named firefox.exe. So subsequent windows opened
should be torparked.

@_subject: Same entry and exit node? 
Consider that if you are running a tor server, and your circuits never
used  your server as an exit node, that would be rather simple rule to
identify  you.  To appear anonymous, you have to give every node equal
statistical probability of being used as an exit node, and then taking
in balancing I suppose.

@_subject: Regarding directory updates 
I was thinking that if Torpark becomes popular, there are many people
outside of China who would use it. This creates the possibility of
clogging tor with thousands of extra circuits while not giving back
any bandwidth. So I am going to build a server configuration for it.
However, most people probably won't stay connected for longer than 30
minutes to 2 hours at a time. I notice when I start Tor, I don't start
getting lots of circuits very fast. Tor is not using my bandwidth
efficiently from the beginning, it has to ramp up to consume all the
available bandwidth. I am wondering if it would be better to use the
Dirport as a push technology so servers can get updated really fast.
Is there a better solution for optimizing that 30 minute to 2 hour
time slot of the potential Torpark servers?

It is possible. One thing we are considering is a socks handler to

of Torpark servers, if I create server editions?

I will release a package in Chinese as well. These should be available

it on a USB flash drive or whatnot. You could also just put it in any

I like the idea of the self-contained firefox and tor client on a

(outsourced DNS) firefox that is mobile yet?

Strange, I will keep an eye out for which names resolve back to

explain it!

Okay, great, we have linux tor on a USB keychain for $45...
Anyone interested in testing or helping me develop a USB image for
Firefox/Tor/Privoxy, or Deer Park/Tor?
This should be a 1 hour project, i think, if we can get deerpark alpha
2 portable version... else we have to resort to the damn privoxy...
The advantage is you don't have to run an OS, it is completely
configed for windows, with autorun.inf interface, can fit on 32/64mb (?), runs firefox, and is free.

In that case, break apart DPA2, and we'll get to work on the firefox
update so we don't have to use privoxy.

Hello Sebastian,
The  main  torpark  website  is  routing  it  from  your mirror to the
university servers (omega.uta.edu). While they limit me on space, they
do  not  limit my bandwidth. So if I can start getting their server to

Howdy all,
New  version of Torpark available. Here is the english demo
without NoScript. I'll have the rest of the packages built
a little later. Let me know if you find any bugs. Also, if
anyone has win95 or win98 running, I would be interested to
find out how it turns out.
- Using Tor v0.1.1.18
- Tor log file is written to the temp directory while Torpark is running.
- all plugins now write to the executable temp direcory instead of the
local directory. Directory is deleted when Torpark exits.
- ExecDos.dll garbage bug fixed
- NoScript WILL be added for this next version, as javascript sites have
  been quietly loading disallowed flash plugins, compromising security.
- Torpark is again, smaller and faster. New splash as well.

Are there other possible solutions that we could integrate with Tor to

could implement SSL proxies, but this simply takes the burden of
plain-text from the exit node to the end of the SSL connection.
Or better yet, should there be a new international policy that all
websites/ISPs should impose SSL? What would the effects be on traffic
loads if this were to take place?
In the very least we should consider informing website hosts that if
they have sensitive information where dissidents or otherwise often
visit, that SSL should be mandatory.

@_subject: Tor Question 
Okay,  so  i  COULD  send the plaintext signal to the control port and
have  success  under win32. I thought you said this, but questioned my
memory once i read the code.
The  reason I ask about winking nodes is that I added a button to kill
the  tor  process.  When  torpark  notices  that  there is no longer a
tor.exe  process,  it  restarts it. Occasionally the tor process would
instantly  exit  for  some reason, too infrequent/inconsistent to tell
everyone to log, but frequent enough to be an annoyance. The upshot is
that  if  you  want  to flush your tor circuit, you can simply click a
button  on  the  toolbar  and  it  gets  you a new circuit. I did this
because  often a user will be surfing and circuit fails for one reason
or another and they have to shut down and restart the browser to get a
new  circuit.  Because the process is so dirty, I am worried about how
it may affect the tor network.
I still have yet to heavily research making torpark actually talk with
tor.exe  instead  of  kicking it around. I wonder if it is possible to
pipe  these  plaintexts  directly to the controlport with some command
line program.

UPX  works  well  on some of the files, not so hot on others. the NSIS
generated files fail UPX, but this is possibly because of a CRC check.
However,  there  is  great success in compressing firefox.exe from 7MB
down  to  2.5MB, when the archive is decompressed. Unfortunately, this
deflated  size  adds up to an even larger compressed sfx archive, even
under  LZMA Ultra. However... if you UPX the LZMA Ultra of the regular
size  archive, you get a 100K reduction. Small, but significant over a
million downloads.
I  haven't spoken much about it, but does anyone think a self-destruct
button on Torpark would be worthwhile? It would wipe the whole Torpark
application  and  directories,  and  kill  the processes (and possibly
close the connections, if we get technical about it.)

Another  possibility...  that  it  runs  from  an encrypted container.
However  this may require device drivers and administrative access. If
only  there was a way to shift a program and files entirely to memory,
without the need to create a virtual drive or have admin access.
What  algo? Probably a fast random scramble or guttman, 7+ passes. But
considering the space will be about 24MB, x 7, = 168MB of writing. How
fast can a USB 1.0 drive write?
Where  is might store firefox data? Not too big a deal. Firefox itself
is innocuous. No actual files are stored to the local drive because of
Torpark, unless you count the swap for memory usage.
Will  they  click  the  button  without  realizing  the consequence? I
imagine  they  will,  once.  I  could  make  it  where  it is a hotkey

- Portable Firefox v1.5
- Ad Block
- Exit node IP listed in status bar
- Single executable file for cleaner startup/shutdown.

Some significant changes are that Tor.exe used to exit for the first time it was run on a few machines even though torpark hadn't quit running. I was able to solve this problem with the help of John T.

new extensions.
Firefox  and  tor  modules  have been updated, the Live IP address bar
updates  every  1  minutes,  and you can turn on/off tor thanks to the
torbutton extension.
The directory structure has been changed to match Portable Apps suite,
so  now you can replace Portable Firefox if you so desire. In the full
release  there  will  be an extension available that causes Torpark to
use Portable Thunderbird as the mail handler, and vice versa.

- Torpark now uses the Portable Apps directory structure, which means
  you can seamlessly replace Portable Firefox.
- Included optional Torpark/Portable Thunderbird extension for interoperability
- New Torpark search page default, includes privacy feeds and scroogle scraped output.
- IP status bar extension updates every 1 minute
- EVERY LANGUAGE NOW INCLUDED, so there is only one version. To change
  languages simply unpack Apps\Torpark\lang\yourlang.zip to Apps\Torpark. Default is
  english, as America seems to be the new Roman Empire.
- Smarter handling of Tor circuit launches, greater redundancy
- Fixed bug of closing too fast which could leave files behind.
- Increased timeout length from 2 minutes to 5 minutes
- Increased support in sourcecode for changing directory structures
- Enhanced splash screen for good luck.

Hello Steven,
Sounds like you are getting a demo message from compiler PE. Is that what you are using? If not, it may have been compiled that way, as the demo will randomly put that in. I would suggest instead to use Quick Batch File Compiler. That and your path must be incorrect, but if it is already compiled I can't tell you what the expected path is.

If you take a look in the source tar, you would see that I had already

It  appears  that the CORALized mirrors had not updated the version of
the source tar it was distributing.
I've replaced it with a direct download from the server.
It  includes  all licenses, directions on how to build torpark, and is
fully   license  compliant.  The  tor.exe  and  firefox  binaries  are
non-modified  and  are  also fully license compliant. You can get them
from  their  creators.  When I start to modify the mozilla binaries, I
will include the source of course.
For interested parties, the source tar is here:
And  yes,  you  might  get  a different checksum, even with LZMA Solid
compression.  The  compiler could be different from the one i download
months  back,  the plugins might have been updated, and there were two
lines  of  code in the original source that were from a next version I
was  working  on,  which was in regards to the SSL seed in the windows
registry.  However,  that  isn't  part of the current build, so I took
those  two  lines  out  after  I  noticed them in there, so the source
should  be  exactly  the  same  except  for  a  modification date, and
assuming there is no trash in file header its self.

Actually Keith, that is not the case with Firefox. Martin is correct.
Firefox  can do remote DNS resolution, which is done through the SOCKS
proxy.  This  does  NOT leak DNS requests, and they are passed through
Just  surf  to "about:config" and find remote dns, and make sure it is
set  to  true.  Then  set  up  your  machine to use a SOCKS proxy with

@_subject: Traces left by Torpark, and other security discussion (was Re: TorPark) 
Hello Steven,
I will check out the claims about the registry. I performed a diff on
it from running and after and found only the SSL seed value changed.
Perhaps there are some other changes. I will check those out for sure.
Regarding the rest of the registry keys, if they are indeed persistant
and constant, I will add code to remove them.
I am wondering if all of that is moot, since we are not actively
destroying the data. I can also fix the swap at reboot issue, but that
may require changing a reg value permanently. I will certainly look at
In the mean time, the whole website is being redone and should be up
in a week. I will post the updates then, and some of the other fixes
we talked about.
And it is true, we are avoiding scripts from torpark.nfshost.com, or
at least that was the plan, as it was going to be running an update
server. In actuality, we are moving the update server to a different
address. The result there is that we may allow scripts to run, but I
am sure we will be automatically adding an SSL certificate acceptance
to the client so the user doesn't get annoying popups when the client
tries to update. The releases will be signed, and the updater will
automatically use SHA1.
Regarding the swap, that really isn't my specialty, so you are right,
the claim is overstated. I will try to figure out a solution. I spoke
with a few developers about creating ram drives, but this requires
system drivers and administrator access. It may be that we cannot do
anything about it, or more to the point it may be moot because Tor
creates many network signatures. I would sure be interested in
everyone's input.
The whole thing is going to be rewritten into python within the next
few months, so that the open-source community can be more involved in
Torpark development. Let's face it, NSIS is a great scripting
language, but is platform dependent and very limited.

I am supposing it will variable. I will naturally have to verify it.
And then again, all these points may be moot once we rewrite the whole
thing in python. But they aren't moot right now, so I will figure out
a way to actively search for changes and remove them.
I will look into the method of how these registry issues cataloged
into system restore. There may be no ability to control it if the
computer is already running such a program to capture registry
changes. Naturally, the same thing can be said if the target computer
is running a keylogger.
I will import it as an accepted certificate directly into the client,
before distribution. I haven't decided on the specifics, I am hiring
someone much more knowledgeable than myself to handle this, and I will
of course have full disclosure of how it works.
Because components may need to be updated. For example, if we notice
some error setting in a preference file, or discover some other
vulnerability, we can correct the problem globally in all of our
clients. I don't think the software is mature enough to say "this is
rock solid". We are still finding bugs, and with any new code, you
introduce the possibility of new bugs. In specific, our users are not
the type that typically go looking for the latest security patch, so
we need the ability to securely push it to them. I want to give as
much care as possible but until I can make the whole thing an
open-source foundation and implement a cvs, that isn't going to
Additionally, as we grow in users, we get more feedback and discover
more problems like Win2k SP2 compatibility issues. With this, we will
be able to much more easily correct the problem.
I will let everyone know what this requires, if such a solution can be

Hello Total,
No need to worry. This is just overzealous antivirus software probably
looking at a heuristic of a dll being called by Torpark. We had the
same problem with a few other scanners, but the companies finally got
off their butt and fixed their antivir problem. I guess F-Secure is
lagging behind. New version coming out very soon, and will have

@_subject: Win32.Trojan.Agent appear when close Torpark 
If the problem is being caused by the killprocdll, you can download
and verify it from here:
I  may  switch  from using KillProcDll for the next version of Torpark
that  I release. The reason that KillProcDLL is called is to make sure
that  no  tor process is staying resident even after a shutdown signal
has been sent to the program.
And fyi, Torpark does not use Firefox Portable at all anymore, my code
is  way more advanced. However, I still give credit to John Haller, as
he  deserves  his  due.  Cord also deserves recognition on writing the
win32  signaler  for  Tor, god bless him. And it might be of some note
that  Tor  is  also  created  from  other  works  such as libcrypt and
openssl,  so talking about how one program is made from others seems a
dubious  distinction.  The  reason I don't modify those sources is for
the  security,  veracity,  and  the  ability for users to easily build
Torpark. There seems to have been a lot of recalcitrance towards Win32
users. You may recall that until quite recently, the method to compile
Tor  for  a  win32 environment was obscure, out-dated, and of very low
importance to the Tor developers. Thankfully, some kind person stepped
in  to  clear up the issue. No doubt that has garnered some resentment
and false appreciation.
Secondly,  I  doubt  you  will  ever  see  Torpark endorsed by the Tor
developers,  but  not  for  a  lack  of  merit, security, open source,
documentation,  or  licensing  compliance; which have all been phantom
claims against it. To my knowledge, the Tor developer making all these
false  complaints  has  never  actually  run Torpark, or looked at the
source  code.  Yet  he  can  still  find time to cast doubt against it
without  concerning  himself with the trouble of investigating his own
claims. He has even gone so far as to insist that he is working on his
own version of Torpark, due to these phantom menaces.
In  the one year it has been around, Torpark seems to have rivaled Tor
for popularity, which has been around for (4+?) years. I can only feel
that this has lead to actions implying insecurity. Feel free to google
"Tor+eff"  vs  "Torpark".  And  I've  tried  to  give  credit  and the
opportunity  to  be  part  of  it,  but  alas.  Since the inception of
Torpark,  Tor awareness has skyrocketed, leading to a quadruple of Tor
servers  and  an order of magnitude of new users. I don't want to take
the  credit on that, as the Germany busts and anti-tor whitepapers may
have  had something to do with it; but to be quite honest, this hasn't
been  a  banner  year  for  Tor. Perhaps this is the price you pay for
ignoring  your  largest user-base (win32) and engaging in intellectual
snobbery. In any case, I think Alexander Hamilton said it best.
And  lastly,  to  clear  up any concerns about cDc etc: You may recall
that cDc released Back Orifice, which embarassed Microsoft back tot he
drawingboard. Hacktivismo is the human-rights wing of the cDc. I am an
attache  of  Hacktivismo.  Hacktivismo  has also released Scatterchat,
which  is  a  PKE  secured,  Tor anonymized, end-to-end encrypted chat
program.  I  developed  Torpark  before  I became an attache, but have
heavily  developed  it  further since then. I will continue to develop
it,  and  a new release is waiting in the wings, with some awesome new
features  like auto-update and a broadband-speed anonymization network
that  solves  the  trust  issue  of  multiple  exit nodes sniffing the
traffic.  I  am also shortly going to release a Tor+Thunderbird client
with    superfast   anonymous+offshore+encrpted+SSL-only+POP/IMAP+LDAP
Address  book+hot  backup-ed  email service, and I hope my users enjoy
the hell out of it because I do it all for them.

@_subject: Tor control spec 
Greetings everyone.
I had some questions asked to me about the control spec, if you know
the answers, I would greatly appreciate to find out. I am speaking
with the PuTTY developer about adding a control mechanism to PuTTY as
well. Obviously this stuff is better directed at Nick and Roger.
  - What Windows IPC mechanism provides such a data channel
    conveniently? (I _think_ the answer is `named pipes', but I have
    yet to try using one.)
     + In particular, you need to handle inter-process security
       correctly: Windows machines _can_ have multiple users even if
       it isn't the normal mode of use, so the control port needs to
       be resistant to connections from unauthorised processes. A
       local TCP socket, in particular, is definitely unacceptable.
       Unix domain sockets are obviously the right thing on Unix, but
       Windows?
Further, here are some questions about the security and implementation
of such an idea. These are unrelated to OR of course.
  - How do the controlled process (for these purposes, the server)
    and its controller (the client) initially get in touch with one
    another? Having a central well known name for the server's named
    pipe or socket or whatever is adequate for a monolithic
    application such as Firefox which can simply enforce only ever
    having one instance running, but it doesn't cut it for PuTTY
    which can have more than one. Options include
     + having a subprocess on a well known port which tracks all the
       other running instances (complex, fragile, administratively
       inconvenient)
     + having the first PuTTY to start up be that tracker in addition
       to its other duties (even more complex and fragile, especially
       when it somehow has to hand over control to another PuTTY when
       the first one shuts down)
     + allocating sockets upwards from zero in a numbered space
       (expensive for the client to enumerate them, and difficult for
       it to know when it's found them all)
     + only allocating a control socket when the user specifically
       asks for one, and giving it a user-specified name (of very
       limited usefulness compared to a solution which doesn't
       require explicit cooperation between the processes)
     + some other approach specific to the IPC mechanism being used
     + something else?

To avoid this, you must uninstall zone alarm and get a real firewall.
Then contact zone alarm, tell them they make a crappy product and why.

It is regardless of the tor traffic being accepted. We know that at

xB Machine v0.2.2 DEVELOPMENT PRE-RELEASE(370MB)
DOWNLOAD HERE:
xB Machine is a virtual machine built on the Gentoo platform, and is
designed to provide a strong IP leak-resistant system and network
design, hardened security against local attacks, and access to the Tor
network and XeroBank network. The functional use of the software is for
secure and anonymous communications and financial transactions.
The effect for the end user is that they can use the internet
anonymously and view rich media such as Flash, in addition to the
protection of a relatively hardened and well-featured operating system.
xB Machine can run on VMWare and QEMU.
xB Machine conforms to the Portable Privacy framework:
    - Portability
    - Trustworthiness
    X - Source Code
      - License
      - Fail Securely
      - Imputed Privacy
    - Elegance
      - Appealing
      - Intuitive
      - Easy to Use
      - Self-Contained
    X - Informative of Status
      - Transparency
Source-code, design spec, and security spec is forthcoming. The license
is currently TESLA, but it is expected to become HESSLA or GPL as the
project develops.
The following list is inclusive, not exhaustive.
The current features are as follows:
- Firewalled NIC
- Segmented program partition from userdata filesystem
- Loop AES encrypted userdata filesystem
- Host system integrity check
- Remote encrypted filesystem mounting via WebDavFS/SSHFS
- Proxy autoconfiguration script for selecting the network used.
- Self-Destruct sequence to destroy AES key, and then data wipe of
encrypted user partition.
- Local Exploit Protections (GrSecurity, stack protection, few suids,
and more)
- Support for Tor, xB Plus, xB Pro/Premium. Future support for xB Onion
- Firefox, customized with addons and configurations for speed and
security options. (PrefBar, AdBlock Plus, DOM disabled, Pipelining, etc)
- Thunderbird customized with addons and configurations for speed and
security options. (Enigmail, DOM disabled, Pipelining, etc)
- Pidgin w/ OTR plugin for access to SILC, AIM, MSN, Y!, ICQ, etc. OTR
plugin secures the chat with AES encryption, and uses DH key exchanges
for perfect forward secrecy.
- Generic text editor and image viewer. These will likely be upgraded in
future releases.
Future features:
- PGP keysigned auto-update system
- LiveCD functionality
- xdm to be respected
- Mac Address changing (broken under VMWare)
- Programs spying on network setup
- Programs sending rogue packets
Main Threat Vectors:
- OpenVPN
- Firefox
- Thunderbird
- Pidgin
- etc

@_subject: Reducing java leakage in windows 
It appears that Java attacks for causing external IP data to be leaked
can be mitigated to some good degree. The upshot is that you can now run
Java applets that even when attempting to phone home directly (revealing
your IP), they are routed through the socks port and thus Tor or any
other socks speaking application. What we are doing is changing the
proxy settings of the Java Control Panel in windows. The following will
shortly be applied to xB Browser after testing, and I highly suggest it
for other proxy programs. Needs lots of testing of course, and I would
also like to know if Java applets can acquire the authority to modify
that file as well. May require administrative access, but I imagine
Vista will popup a priv escalation window. There are probably variations
in the directories and syntax if you are running JRE <1.4. A good
indicator of old versioning is to see if your shoes employ the use of
velcro, you have a pair of 'jams' in your closet, or you've found
yourself to be too legitimate to quit.
Steve Topletz
1. Look for $APPDATA\Sun\Java\Deployment\deployment.properties
If there is no deployment.properties file there, try all administrative
usernames we can enumerate until we find the file. This is not a certianty.
2. Back up deployment.properties to a new file name.
3. Open it up
4. Read and store all lines beginning with "deployment.version"
5. Read and store all lines beginning with "deployment.javapi"
6. Close the file
7. Create a new file deployment.properties where the old one was.
8. Open the file
9. Insert the following lines
  deployment.system.tray.icon=false
 deployment.browser.vm.iexplorer=false
 deployment.proxy.socks.host=localhost
 deployment.proxy.type=1
 deployment.proxy.same=true
 deployment.browser.vm.mozilla=false
 deployment.capture.mime.types=true
 deployment.proxy.socks.port=8080
(where port 8080 is your socks port. in Tor, use 9050 by default)
10. Write all previously stored lines from old opened file.
11. Close the new deployment.properties
Continue starting your proxy program
On program exit...
12. Delete the deployment.properties file we created.
13. Restore the deployment.properties file we backed up.

@_subject: xB Browser automated build process 
Now anyone can run the automated build process and build an xB Browser
installation pack themselves. I wrote the make script in batch language.
This current make automatically downloads the latest firefox from mozilla,
verifies the signatures, and unpacks it. In the future, when the tor win32
binaries use the new installer I wrote a patch for, we'll then be able to
extract the executables just like we currently can with firefox. It would sure
be easier if Tor Projects had a "latest" build directory for automatic
downloading. My thoughts are if that if people really want to be able to drop in
and build an install themselves, let them be able to grab the latest packages
online too. We've already got the code in the makefile that would do the
download and verification if such a directory was available. As it stands, we've
just instead put the latest build locally in the xbbrowser/Library/Tor directory
on the SVN as there is no point in rsyncing it if you've already got the SVN in
front of you.
So, without further adieu...

@_subject: Reducing java leakage in windows 
Do you have a copy of these tests? I'm definitely interested in seeing
it. However, I am NOT posing this as a solution to java issues, just
another defense layer. This effectively keeps non-malicious applets from
surreptitious leakage. I highly doubt a determined application would be
cornered in, but most seem to be. Regarding DNS, well that is again
another issue to be looked at, unfortunately.

@_subject: Reducing java leakage in windows 
Okay pause.
We need to distinguish here because ya'll are talking about different
terms. Internal network IP (192.168.x.x, etc), external IP (your public
IP address), and DNS requests (locally vs remote through socks). The
internal network IP probably isn't a terribly valuable piece of
information to most snoops. The local DNS is an issue because you're
telling your local network/ISP or whomever what addresses  you're
looking at. The big issue is the external network IP, which is what the
public sees and identifies the home user's specific computer.
So what we want to see is an applet running around the
deployment.properties setting, exposing the external network IP. The DNS
leakage should also be investigate of course.

@_subject: xB Browser automated build process 
We have a NSIS automated build process. So anyone can now build xB
Browser based on the SVN repository. It takes any version of xB Browser
you select, and then builds that against the latest library files, the
result is a fully completed XeroBank Browser Installer file, not just
the package.
Steve Topletz
The short version:
compile XeroBank Installer.nsi
The long version:
svn://support.xerobank.com/xbbrowser/Installer - Main build directory.
svn://support.xerobank.com/xbbrowser/Library - Static files of Tor,
Firefox, and profile. Replace as you please.
svn://support.xerobank.com/xbbrowser/Latest - Latest build of xB
Browser, installer looks for xBBrowser.exe from this directory.
1. First you designate which xB Browser version you want. Installer by
default selects the "Latest" directory, but you can change this in
Installer/XeroBank Installer.nsi, at the PACKAGEVER definition. For
example "2.0.0.10a".
2. Make sure a xB Browser executable is available to make into the
package. Whatever directory you selected for PACKAGEVER, be sure to
compile _build.nsi first to generate a xBBrowser.exe.
3. Update the Library directory to include any version of Tor or Firefox
you like. Tor is at App/tor, Firefox is at App/Browser, Portable PuTTY
is at App/Xerobank/XeroBankPlus.exe, Firefox browser profile is at
4. Compile XeroBank Installer.nsi, and it will pack up the xB Browser
executable and all the library files in App and Data. The result is a
complete installation program.
This doesn't yet go to the web and snag the latest tor and firefox, but
it's a lot further along. The next version will probably break apart the
library directory. If you are missing any plugins, they are included in

@_subject: Blocking child pornography exits 
In democratic societies, the freedoms that exist are tools without
regard to their use. Freedom of speech, as well as all other liberties,
can be exercised for good or evil. These tools enrich a democratic
society by adding tools to the toolbox, and help bring democracy where
there is none, anti-censorship technology in particular.
What you propose is analogous to "if you can't say something nice, don't
say anything at all;" which is merely another form of censorship. ie,
Someone said something mean to me when I was a child, so I don't think
we should allow people to speak unless it isn't hurtful.
Let us step back. Say we blocked "child porn"... What constitutes child
pornography? How young is a child? A minor? By what standard of what
country or culture? Yours? Greek? Russian? American? French? German? Is
it pornographic because you derive sexual pleasure from viewing it, and
thus we should ban all photos of children because you could look at a
gymnastics or bathing photo and receive gratification? Is it art, or
erotica, or is it pornography? Is it a "child" expressing themselves who
took a photo, and thus we are censoring their speech? Who is going to
define these standards, and how will they be implemented? All of these
are hairy questions, and simply not what Tor does or is designed to do.
Tor is a freedom-enabling technology, not a censorship technology. There
are far too few of the former, and a deluge of the latter.
The bottom line is that freedom is inherently exciting, and can be used
for good or evil; but once you try to limit it to being used for "good",
it ceases to be freedom.
Steve Topletz
P.S. If you believe that something shouldn't be designed that it
prevents/discourages people from using it for evil, I hope you don't

- Firewall only allows anonymity client outgoing/incoming traffic
from/to external interfaces. No outgoing traffic without anonymity
- Some hardening to make local exploits less easy (GrSecurity,
stackprotection, minimal suids, etc)
Anonymity clients:
- Tor
- Jap
- xB Plus
- xB Pro / Premium
Usability features:
- Firefox with privacy extensions and settings
- Thunderbird with privacy extensions and settings
- GPG and Enigmail
- Pidgin w/ OTR Chat client
- Text editor, image viewer
- Filemanager
- Autoconfiguration of anonymity clients
- Proxy autoconfiguration of clients (Firefox, Thunderbird without
restart of program)
- Remote filesystem via WebDavFS/SSHFS with encfs
- Local user filesystem with loop-aes
- Userdir with dmcrypt/pam_mount
- Console (command line text thing, green characters on black background )
Windowmanager: Enlightenment
Additional features:
- Easy updating without destroying userdir
- Integrity check from host system
Future features:
- LiveCD to boot Qemu and xBVM
Details on firewall:
- Each outgoing software runs under it's own userID
- Firewall only allows those userIDs
- LSM SecLVL to keep router/firewall from being changed if system got
hacked locally (maybe, not sure on that yet)

I wrote Torpark, so let me respond to your points.
1) Torpark is only for windows at the moment, it will be available for
Mac and Linux shortly.
2) Torpark is not commercial, it is totally free and open source. We
simply offer an upgrade to get higher speeds than the tor network can
3)  The  fact  that  trust  isn't  distributed  is  a  positive, not a
negative,  because you don't have to trust everyone with your outgoing
plaintext traffic. We have independent security auditors make sure our
admins  are  not tracking anyone or doing anything malicious. However,
we are using a distributed trust internally, so if anyone comes asking
for  customer info, they won't get them without NSA letters to all our
associates  in  all  our  jurisdictions.  And  naurally, free users of
torpark we don't have any records of anyway.
4)  The  online  tutorial  is  only a video for streaming. Perhaps you
would  prefer  to download the 25mb file directly? Or perhaps you know
of  a  way  to  stream video without using scripting? I'll be happy to
5)  Offshore  from  the  USA,  UK,  etc.  We  have servers in Germany,
Malaysia,  and  some other hidden places. Currently none in the USA or
UK,  etc.  Unfortunately,  it  is  better to not tell you specifically
where  they  are  because  that  makes  it much harder for agencies to
attempt  to  subpoena/court order. If they are guessing jurisdictions,
we  are  all  happier.  Bottom line is place faith in audits. Further,
Torrify  is  formed as an offshore corp in the country of Saint Kitts,
so it is not subject to US laws, only those of UK Commonwealth and the
6) Regarding commercial anonymity, you will eventually realize that it is
the only way to go for high speed and low latency, otherwise the
network will be abused and suffer the tragedy of the commons.
Further, the browser is entirely capable of having no flash, java,
javascript, plugins, and all of those are blocked by default.
And  lastly, TORPARK IS FREE. It just isn't released under the GPL, it
is  released  under  the TESLA license, which is similar to the HESSLA
license.  Because the way it is written GPL can have malware inserted,
the TESLA makes a legally actionable violation if malware is inserted.
With such sensitive project, I insist that people are not legally able
to abuse it.

You  are  right.  We  don't allow governments to subvert our software,
commercial competitors, or people to install spyware and redistributed
that way.
Saying free and open-source software isn't "Free" and "Open Source" is
giving  in to a combination of semantics and snobbery of licensing. It
isn't  as  though  any  organization owns the definition of "Free" and
"Open  Source"  and has the authority to pin it down to their specific
hoops we must jump through, nor should anyone assume we have.
The source is totally free, and that isn't "Free" but free, _except_ I
don't allow for other commercial services to rip it off and use it for
their  personal  gain since I am giving it away to the public, and you
can't install tracking/spyware/malware in it and then redistribute it.
Those  are  pretty  much  the  only restrictions. Perhaps GPL fanatics
think  I  owe  it  to spyware manufacturers, or I need to give away my
intellectual  property to every 3rd-rate commercial anonymity service?
The  bottom  line  is, everyone benefits by these restrictions, except
for malware manufacturers and commercial anonymity services.
I think your software is a pretty clear violation of the TESLA license
because you specifically allow spyware and malware to be inserted into
your  software due to your licensing terms, but then again, you didn't
release  yours  under TESLA, and nor am I required to conform to DFSG.
Because  I've seen the light of an ethical software license agreement,
I  no  longer give much credence to "Open-Source" definition or "Free"
according to hoyle or DFSG.
But it definitely is a balance that must be struck. Tor probably has a
good license, even if it isn't 3 clause BSD, because it is straight up
difficult  to  use  for  the average user. But Torpark is too easy for
conforming  to those definitions, because with convenience it makes to
a  little  too  easy  for  malware and snoopers to reach users because
users no longer have to have a techinical understanding or perform due
dilligence  on  their  software, so we have to provide some protection
for them. The TESLA license is just that.
To be quite clear, I am enamoured by the HESSLA.

Fabian et al,
Let  us  not be ambigious about the "users" you are talking about. The
specific  "users"  you  are talking about are limited by definition to
only  be  the ones wanting to modify it to include malware/trojans, or
someone  trying  to  turn it into a commercial application, or an evil
government  that  does not abide by the universal declaration of human
rights.  Anyone  who  falls  under  one of those three definitions who
can't consider it free, I'm not concerned about. To _all_ other users,
it  is  free  and open source, and they can do what they want with it,
and modify and distribute it how they please.
The  distinction you are attempting to make anti-thetical to security.
Somehow I just can't see my way clear to advocating modification of my
software  for the use of spyware and commercial competitors. I fail to
see  what  legitimate  interest  you  or  anyone  else have in keeping
software  from  being  legally  protected  against  having trojans and
malware inject into them, and still considering it free.
Instead of attacking my usage of free because it causes some cognitive
dissonance,  you  may  consider  asking  why  other  licenses  haven't
restricted  use  of  their terms from having malware injected into it.
Especially  a  project like Tor. Personally, I don't mind if a license
causes  a  little  more  confusion  to big brother, xyz proxy corp, or
spyware inc, or anyone, if I and my users get more protection. I would
certainly like to see that in the Tor license.
No, it is free to the public, we aren't discriminating against who can
use it. We ARE restricting how it can be MODIFIED.
Fabian,  if  there  really are legitimate potential users out there in
the  cosmos,  waiting  for  me to open it up to malware and trojans so
they  can  feel  the  universal  definition of "Free" is consistent to
whatever  culture  they happen to be from, they can keep holding their
breath.  And  to  the  others  who  don't care enough except to make a
pedantic  distinction,  I'll  be  expecting  a  letter  from  the  FSF
regarding how they own the trademark "Free".
Once  again,  would  anyone else like to see Tor's license add that it

to me that the SM would have to be very intelligent to know that the
harmless X, Y, and Z parts of the script form a dangerous whole. I
think that starts entering into heuristics. Surely someone here knows
way more about this and will comment. I would love to see such a tool.

I'll address these issues since you didn't feel it was

1) tor devs are not qualified to review the code. Shava Nerad of the
Tor project  asked me to refer someone to do QA on 3rd party win32 apps for the Tor
project, which I did. Will it ever happen? Who knows.
2) Those are not issues with Torpark but the windows operating system.
However, in a future release of Torpark we are working on even the
faults of the win os will be addressed. Those issues are 1) the way
windows treats memory, and 2) the way windows treats applications and
may cache them. Since then I have removed the section about it not

I could add this function to Torpark, if:
1) A lot of people want it
2) TOR project implements directory distribution that can use these
temporary middleman and exit nodes as a positive, rather than
depending on long-lived nodes.
You can do this with Torpark right now. You can reach .onion addresses
right from the address bar. If people would like to compile a list of
services, I could publish that list as browser bookmarks in the next
release of Torpark.

1. People may not want to use it if it starts sharing their IP for
the network. Although, acting as a middleman may be a good compromise.
In Torpark 3.0, we can probably do most of these.
2. Where will this be displayed, and who is going to read it?
3. Why keep any cookies at all after a session?
4. Sure. We can do this with Torpark 3.0
5. Already covered
6. I especially like  now how to we get the tor network to route this
as an exit node? Well... it would be great that instead of hashes we
could name the onion addresses fully. So if you wanted to check if
torrify.com had an exit node you could use to access it, you could
simply do torrify.com.onion... a simple naming convention.

Well it is possible, but as was stated before I don't think that
active content is the culprit.
It would work like this: Tor button is on automatically, meaning tor
is selected. In this mode noscript preferences are locked to global
deny. When Tor button is off, noscript prefs are unlocked, but block
by default.
As I said it is possible, but when you treat the user like a child it
is going to be an issue to get them to keep using it.

Security is NOT binary, it is a process, and it is a gradient. We only
desire the illusion of it being binary. There is compromise in every
design, take tor for example using 128bit crypto because it is pretty
secure and fast enough to encrypt on the fly. I'm sure there are
people that wish it was doing 512bit elliptic curve or some other
thing out there.
However,  it  is  possible we could come up with some secure-only mode
which   locks  out  most  features,  virtually  all  the  plugins  and
functionality, and puts the user in a rigid framework in order to give
a  little  more  security  and  a stronger impression of anonymity. Of
course,  this  makes  it a significantly unpleasant experience and one
might as well use lynx at that point.

We've rewritten xB Browser to version 2.0.0.9/10 and are about to
introduce some new functionality to it. I thought this would be a lovely
time to take a step back and acquiesce to some prior requests for a doc
on how to build xB Browser from scratch. I've got some questions, and
hopefully you've got some opinions and maybe requests of your own.
1. Given the somewhat complicated layout mechanisms in Mozilla, would
you be willing to have instructions that say to the effect "Go to
View|Toolbar|Customize and drag button xyz to the toolbar where desired"
or do we demand to see a file-based placement?
2. Given the above, you will get users placing the toolbar items or
buttons in slightly different order, or editing a file with an editor
that may not have the same /$r/$n EOL functions, thus we will end up
with different hashes/sizes from one user to the other, despite them
being the same build. Is that acceptable? What is an acceptable
alternative if not?

@_subject: A question of preferences 
I'm writing the preferences for the xB Browser, and I've been thinking
about the problem of users who are smart enough to be dangerous to
themselves. I'm talking about those that jump into the proxy settings
and think they are speeding things up by changing to a direct connection
or auto-detect.
Well, yeah, they're speeding up alright, but at the cost of breaking
their anonymity.
So it occurs to me I can keep those settings from being persistent
(nothing can stop someone who is determined to wreck their privacy). I
can do this by employing the user.js, which over-rides whatever the
users sets in their prefs.js files.
Therefore, I am thinking about what settings should be hard-coded on
browser/client startup.
The goal was "The purpose of user.js is to hardcode browser settings to
keep users from compromising their network anonymity beyond preferences."
That means for Tor/SSH usage, the browser needs to block plugins.
That means for VPN usage, the browser doesn't need to block plugins.
So now we're talking about two different user.js files entirely.
OK fine. But we get to a new point where we have to decide what things
should and shouldn't be blocked from being persistent from one session
to the next.
Of the following, beyond proxy settings, I'm thinking we should keep
network.dns.disableIPv6 = true ; ipv6 addresses fail through tor.
network.proxy.socks_remote_dns = true
network.proxy.failover_timeout = 0 ;always retry the proxy, never revert.
layout.css.report_errors = false ;get rid of java console errors
There are other privacy related settings such as DOM and session info
that are a grey area, but I am thinking those don't meet the above goal,
and thus should be left as preferences for the user.
Comments and suggestions welcome,

This might be able to work, assuming we figure out if there are any

Actually, I could probably even have Make curl, verify, and unpack the
latest Tor, Firefox, etc.

general step in the right direction.

It is a little out of the way to take a win32 program and put the
build environment in something that isn't convenient for the end-user
who would be doing the build and verification process. So changing
operating systems or requiring cygwin installation isn't conducive. I'll
see if we can keep it win32. But if we had to, we could probably build
in in nix.
And you're right about the default file issue. Just a method of
preference but it would be nice if our distro hash was the same as our
build hash.

How about instead of Make, we use Scons? It should be easier for people
to read and modify.
Additionally, for the list of tor 3rd party devs...
I figured out how to implement the (more) secure persistent settings in
firefox. This will be useful for others trying a similar approach to xB
1. Keep prefs.js with the normal user settings.
2. Load this user.js on top of it, to keep the network settings persistent.
This way the user can change their settings like cache, saving
passwords, etc, but not risk messing up their network settings.
Tested and it works.

@_author: Arrakis 
@_subject: Paid performance-tor option? 
For high bandwidth in addition to low latency, you are correct
that commercial anonymity is the only option. However there are a
lot of issues with commercial anonymity, and anonymity that is
not purely P2P designed. These issues can result in worse privacy
if you don't pay attention to the circumstances of your provider.
Beyond that, many of them have high political risk, and high
legal risk so they are not analogous to Tor, which is distributed and
decentralized, barring authoritative directory servers.
Political risk refers to the possibility of integrity being compromised
due the actions of the country or countries in which the network operates
in. A data retention law, for example, would severely hamper efforts in
anonymity. That means providers like relakks, swissvpn, etc turn into a
honeypot. This also applies to JonDos, as the operators are located in
Germany and the EU, which has a data retention directive in addition to
being a plethora of surveillance societies. To battle this, all of your
traffic must be end-to-end encrypted, but can still be subject to traffic
analysis for context. JonDos however is a slightly different beast. This
is because they operate a mixed-trust model. You are trusting the
operators not to do exit node injection, and it also requires rerouting
through three entities because they do not trust each other. In that
way it is similar to tor.
Other commercial networks, that are single entity, typically have one-hop
or two-hop proxies because they are not disguising origination from
themselves, as that isn't in their threat model. Centralized one-hop
proxies should always be avoided for non-trivial communications or
integrity. The known multi-hop proxies are ironkey, jondos, xerobank,
and cryptohippie.
Legal risk deals with centralization of the operation/operators. These
corporations are governed in surveillance societies, or low-privacy
areas, and are instantly compromised if a record is requested by any
agency of authority. Examples of services with high legal risk are
findnot, anonymizer, ironkey, and cotse.
To attain similar anonymity as tor, with a single trust domain
such as a corporation, they would have to be distributed in server
location, and decentralized in operations. This narrows your choices
down to just two choices that I know of: xerobank as mentioned by
rochester and cryptohippie. Both are incorporated in low risk areas,
and have multi-jurisdictional networks.
There are many providers, all with different levels of integrity
and competence, which should be considered by the user. These come
into play with items like the privacy policy, logging, source
availability of software being used, etc. Other issues are what
type of protocol they use. Beware of L2TP alone, as it does not have
encryption, and thus content is exposed, and only context is
obscured. Beware of PPTP, as it is known to leak DNS. On the relakks
network it leaks 100% the last time I checked. SSH is good, but make
sure you are piping your traffic through it. OpenVPN is a good
choice, and so is IPSec, but again you'll need a good implementation
to prevent leaks, which is often OS dependent.
The bottom line is that providers aren't the same, and anonymity has no
metric of measurement for easy comparison, yet. It's all apples to
oranges. Consider what your needs are, who your potential adversary is,
and do your homework before you buy or demo anything. If you don't, in
many cases, you may as well be CCing your traffic directly to echelon,
as many of the providers are being monitored or are known to proactively
provide logs to law enforcement.

I'm actually the operations advisor for XeroBank, which
is incorporated in Panama. Servers are located in the
US, Canada, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Malaysia,
Denmark, and the UK. The network is fully operational, with
some users reporting speeds of >25Mbps of international traffic
throughput, with a <250ms response time total trip.
We do not use the Tor network, but an IPSec cascade, with
OpenVPN connection clients. Our software, however, is
compatible with the Tor network.
All payments are anonymized through a technology called
VAULTS, which stands for Variable Anonymous User Letterbox
Token System. When you sign up, you are assigned a deposit
account that can handle your ID/payment method. Your account
is funded with chaumian tokens. You are also assigned an
anonymous access account. Tokens flow from the deposit

so we cannot tell who 'funded' which account. This allows
us to anonymize the payments and identity of account holders,
from the activities of the account itself. Kind of a complex
design, but it allows xb to use any payment method they
want, which is currently confined to credit/debit/wire.

I am writing an anonymous email client. The main
delay has been getting it compatible with the xerobank
installer so that it automatically downloads mail
credentials and creates the secmod/key3/cert8 PKCS11
databases and performs automatic encryption of the
user credentials, locking it with the users' PIN code
as the master password.
The design idea is to use an anonymous email server
it into an anonymous account (assuming a clean acct).
So I decided while I picked up a cold at defcon that
I would sit down and finally finish it. It works.
It is built using Mozilla Thunderbird. It will contain
the Enigmail extension, and a self-contained GPG
distribution. It will probably also contain NoScript
because it has an html renderer inside it. The program
already has a built-in auto-updater from xerobank that
will download and install it's own PGP signed updates.
The enigmail will be configured to use 5+ keyservers
such as mit, sks, pgp, etc.
The threat model includes content and context obscurity.
Where this meets Tor and anonymity is the question. It
is my intention to filter by protocol, blocking all
communication that is not using either SSL or TLS. Are
there any other considerations we should have, other
than blocking updates? Should we force OCSP and cert
revokation checking? Is there any reason we shouldn't
include the CACert root certificate? Should we scrap
Tor and make it use mixmaster? Should we force users
to create/import PGP Keypairs?
The more I understand email threats/issues over Tor
the better. I am aware that there are only occasionally
any exit servers allowing port 25, but if we are
forcing SSL/TLS, then it won't matter what port they
pick. So any preferences for extensions and behavior are

Jacob, I'm not spamming the list with licensing ideas. I commented
that the idea contributions would be used in a software licensed
under TESLA, as that is a legitimate caveat for those here, as expressed
before. Your further illustration is a testament to the legitimacy
of that caveat.
As people commonly understand those terms, I disagree. For the 99.9999%
of the users out there, it is free and open source. They don't hit any
restriction. Download it, modify it, sell it, redistribute it modified
or unmodified. That .0001% that apparently some people feel outraged

Shall I say it again? While we can all love Richard Stallman, your
choice of definition is not universal. That the software is open

I'll clarify, as per your reply: FOSS definitions != fact. They
are colloquial, they are subjective terms.
warning: "spam licensing idea" ahead, involves gpl...
We could license it under GPL, but wrap that in a license / software
that says you can't get to the GPL license if you have malicious intent
(possible?). It just seems easier to use a single license.
I'm not sure if you're aware of it, but there are both security and
anonymity implications for passing mail over tor that should be discussed.
And if you haven't understood it yet, we are indeed talking about passing
mail over tor, because that is exactly what the software will do, presumably.
That is what _I_ want to discuss. My only caveat is telling contributors
how I plan to use the information they share. I don't want people to be
angry that I used information or methods in a way that wasn't suitable
to them. That seems like a pretty straight forward issue. For some reason,
Seth thought my disclosure of use required comment, in the interests of
malware producers who might be contributing in the hopes of introducing
malware/spyware. Reductio ad absurdum, that is the logical conclusion to
the objection, if it isn't purely for attempting to open discourse about
subjective terms. Maybe I should think of Seth's post as less of an objection
and more like a wikipedia stub, but then again that isn't how he phrased it
so I'll take the comments as they come.
I remember your same posts about incoginto, tor browser, torpedo, vidalia,
torbutton, janusvm, rockate, etc. You're right. Discussion about software
projects that implement tor don't belong in or-talk. Sure. How am I supposed
to take your comments seriously, Jacob? That lack of evidence doesn't seem
to bloster that claim as your motive. Maybe you're just a very easy-going
guy and decided here is where you would make your stand for disallowing
discussion on or-talk of software that integrates tor, and things that aren't
purely about tor project itself.
Or maybe you're right, and your post doesn't belong on or-talk, and perhaps
neither does this one. In that case, may I suggest that if you have a response,
you send it to me personally? I wouldn't want to force you or anyone else to
violate your self-proclaimed definition of what belongs on or-talk, after all.
At some point you have to step back, abandon the ivory tower, and realize
that your definitions are not the only definitions, and if they were that
still doesn't elevate them into fact. Your position requires that
contention, and is thus untenable. That you've called attention to it in
some attempt to extricate Seth is admirable. However, at the end of the day
I'm here to discuss the implications of sending mail over tor so I can produce
actual software that real people can use, and you're here for some reason other
than that. Pardon me if I don't allow you to undermine my purpose.

I'll look again. When I searched prior, I recall only seeing something
about stopping spam, written by phobos.
Which sends _only_ PGP encrypted email... I'll need to think about that
and talk with "noobs" about how PGP works to see if that is viable. The
main problem with enforcing that is that we have two segments that don't
seem to overlap. We have to write the software to cater to a specific
user schema. Here is the issue:
0. Asymmetric encryption is a difficult concept when first introduced
   to most people. Even PGP corporation can't figure out how to get people
   to understand PGP.
1. Anyone who knows how to send email anonymously already understands how
   asymmetric encryption works. A majority of these people use unix.
2. Anyone who doesn't know how to send email anonymously probably doesn't
   understand how asymmetric encryption works. A majority of these people
   use windows.
3. The former probably doesn't need software help. The latter definitely does.
4. It is my experience that it is nearly impossible to educate the user. They
   want something that just works, and will abandon anything that does not
   intuit and actively give positive feedback.
So we're left with either a spartan client for experts (which is easy), or
the staggering task of designing a client for the uninitiated. I posit that
there may not be enough HCI knowledge on this planet to accomplish the latter
but it would be a very exciting, frustrating, and noble task.
A more reasonable task may be a client that is encryption agnostic, but
focuses on obscuring context through anonymization. This allows for the experts
and novice to use, and is flexible enough to give the uninitiated a taste,
and to create an environment where they feel comfortable learning and trying
public key encryption.
Exactly. The discussion of such how to implement requires some forethought.
First about utility, then about applicability. For tor, I don't know how
well it can handle smtp, imap, or pop protocols. Mixmaster seems to handle
smtp relatively fine, except for the delay. I2P is similarly suffering in
latency as a tradeoff for low observability. Will the user stand for that?
I don't know.
I'll take a look.
Are you thinking of LDAP then? That would require a service provider,
which is unlikely to be supported in a non-commercial software.
I agree that we solve the context problem by enforcing per-message encryption,
but this again seems to push the user around in an experience they may not
be comfortable with, leading to abandonment.
so we could just use cryptographic termination: the users send using
a key that the mailing list can decrypt and recrypt, the mailing list then
sends out with keys it required when everyone first signed up.
This seems to focus on changing behaviors rather than adapting to them.
A group list who can decrypt seems slightly antithetical to protecting
both identity and content. Maybe not. But what it seems to do is to
create a crucible to temper only the experts into being able to use it,
who didn't need it anyway.
I'll look at this as well.
FireGPG provides selective encryption of text using GPG/OpenPGP. A better
approach, in my opinion, is the Thunderbird Enigmail extension, which
prompts but does not enforce PGP encryption, and has an integrated key
manager, and keyserver query engine built into it. I think this is an
excellent foundation to work with, if we can understand how to guide users
into such a harness.
That depends, really, if the client is designed for open or darknet
operation. My current interest is for open network operation, so the
client does not participate. If it was for a darknet, I would probably
say the client should participate.
Possible, but certainly not safe. We would need to browser portion to
enforce end-to-end encryption at all times, and only talk to servers
which were known to use end-to-end without blabbing a cookie in plaintext.
I wouldn't mind adapting my current idea to darknet operations, but it
is not my current intent to reinvent the wheel, so we want to use networks
that already exist out there, like one of either tor or mixmaster.
Max, thank you for your contribution. I'll take your suggestions under
advisement in addition to researching the projects you've mentioned.

It was my intention to block all markup rendering, in addition to blocking
that inside the client.
I'll have to check how thunderbird implements smtp.
Very good observation.
Agreed. I think this was an issue in The Bat! client.
Agreed. Or possibly randomizing the time. This also leads to a timing
correlation on "timeout" settings as well.
It is my intent that people do not use the client to mix anonymous and
non anonymized accounts over an anonymity network, as we would again
break the context protection.
Junk filtering is sticky. Because we are going to use thunderbird, we
can create bayesian filters in token form, and push token updates to
the client. It would be kind of amazing if the latest paris hilton
spam was blocked before the user had to read it. The management program
could update such a token over https, un-anonymized, every x time.
Thats one of those distasteful things about mail, and one of the reasons
I prefer IMAP over POP. POP is fine if you're encrypting your message
base, but if not, IMAP is preferable. But I tell you what... i really
*could* encrypt the messagebase on thunderbird. No telling how secure
that would really be in windows implementation, but it is certainly
a fun idea.

As there is no metric for measuring anonymity, it would be accurate to say
that it is not going to be provable. What we can do is say such a property
reasonably appears to exist, and make our determinations from there.
One problem with the idea of "independent analysis" when applied to
technology,  is that it requires that there is an independent analyst with
equivalent or superior knowledge to the system provider and tools with
which to measure a test, and a metric for measurement. Anything less and
you end up with an estimation that is less matched to the analyst's
ability, and more synchronized to the analyst himself.
If you are providing a system with young technologies implemented in a
unique manner, you are unlikely to find an independent analyst with
mastery in these implementations, or the ability to test, much less
measure the veracity of such claims. The use of independent analysis will
probably come down to warm fuzzies regarding your trust of the reputation
Even then, he can only say at best that it *appears* to have these
However, logically it is possible to disprove claims. If we could agree
on the mastery of the analyst, and his/her independence, then I don't see
why we wouldn't allow such attempts.
Unfortunately, the best possible result you can hope for from the analyst
is "I couldn't break the system, it appears to be what is purports" which
isn't going to be an affirmative response, and would be the same response
given by any less-than-qualified analyst.
This is where we get back to needing a metric to measure anonymity,
otherwise we are snipe-hunting for warm fuzzies. Would you agree?
As there is no metric of measuring anonymity, it would be a moot point
to say there is a technically "better" anonymity. What we can say is this
provides what appears to be better anonymity because of a sound design.
In this specific instance, the matter is that padding increases the
opacity of the context of a transmission. This generally assumes that the
less accurate data an adversary has to perform traffic analysis, the
weaker the signal intelligence and thus the better the anonymity will be.
Perhaps an analogy would be two gifts under a Christmas tree. One is
shrink-wrapped and you can clearly see the outline of the object and the
other is padded in a box. To a casual observer, I could estimate that it
is easier to determine the contents of the shrink-wrapped item rather
than the item in the box. Probably not the best analogy, but just at the
top of the mind.
That is correct, we verify the integrity of the nodes and extend
commensurate trust to the operators of those nodes, which is based
on a reputation system. A pertinent difference is that operators do not
volunteer, they are only invited, so there is little opportunity for
malicious nodes.
If a metric for measuring anonymity is established, I think we would
gladly welcome such an investigation.
The network node ownership and operation is completely decentralized and
distributed. Nodes are owned and operated by different corporations in
unique jurisdictions, differing from the location of the nodes they operate.
It's my pleasure. These are complicated subjects to say the least.

science that the scientific method be followed. The results must be empirical

Exactly. This is hopefully going to make tor stronger and raise
awareness about proper implementation regarding the OSI model.
Unfortunately it pushes most tor-related software into security
obsolescence, including one of our own, through the revelation
that you are fighting a losing battle. It doesn't mean some
can't be salvaged in some incarnation, but it will show that tor
can be turned into a massive liability when you aren't using
sound implementation. So there is a way to "win", and it doesn't
involve defending at layer 4/5/6/7. Those days are over, as soon
as your realize you can stop the effects of 0-days altogether.
So which software/combinations does this issue affect? pretty
much all of them. What would I suggest to do to keep from getting
punked out? Use janusvm or xb machine to access tor. And these
softwares will also keep you safe from that theoretical
vulnerability the other dc talk is supposed to be about. Why?
Because proper implementation removes the attack landscape for
0-day attacks.
It's one hell of a banana, but it's one banana from an infinite
bunch. The particular banana is interesting, but the point is
that you need to change the way your shoes interact with the
floor. And to answer your question without analogy, it works.
Not just on a theoretical level on a research network, but on
the real live tor network, as is, right now.

I think about that a lot. We've got the current version of xB Browser
down to 10 MB. Now if we move to a VM solution you bumped it up to
a 30 MB download at least. Is the issue that the user can't download
that size? Is the issue that the user doesn't have the storage? Is
the issue that the user doesn't have the overhead to run a VM? If we
knew the user you had in mind a little better, that would help. We
have our own idea about who they are based on usage stats, but maybe
that is an after-the-fact metric.
I think the VM solution is possible to meet most of the criteria.
There is a new fork of xb machine/xb browser in the works that may be
hybrid solution.

This is a change I've been pushing for. The only problem is the drastic
evolution of the design. The tradeoff is naturally that we innovate faster
than we can write up a paper, getting those things done in parallel would
be amazing at least. First we solved a vm problem, then we toyed with
remote filesystem mounting, then we scrapped local userdata partition, and
now we're doing some other interesting things. We can get there faster
than we can talk about getting there, and unfortunately the "there" isn't
a place but a process. However, I think we're approaching a point where
we can say "yes, this design solves these problems, and treats these others
in this way" with some consistency. At that point, the paper can get framed.

It's true. Local security has to be strong, which is something we've gotten
a good deal accomplished on in xb's vm. You would be hard pressed to find
a more locked-down system that runs tor. As for the aforementioned attack, it
isn't something I think is only tor's problem, but perhaps a bigger issue.
The point is, you can't just ignore it by writing it out of the threat model.
Or maybe you can? However, we can't just go ahead and spoil christmas for
everyone because you want to know what's in the box. I mean, after all, you've
written a design doc and security analysis. I'm sure the code just writes
itself at that point and you've got nothing to worry about. :D On a
serious note, I don't think it is something you're going to want or be
able to apply a patch to for a strong solution, so disclosing it privately
isn't going to be a concern. Just sit back and enjoy the magic.
Coderman, decimating as usual! You are entirely correct, but a little
perspective is great.
While it is theoretically possible, it becomes exponentially unlikely
as you keep requiring to exploit one vulnerability built upon another.
In this specific case, let's take the xb machine design that kyle is
working on. The real attack vector there is the applications that are
already installed, and more vaguely, the vm itself. However, once the
processes are locked down to a specific uid/permission level you can
keep them from talking to one another or intruding on the other's turf.
Not that it isn't possible, but you shrunk a hole from the size of a
door down to a keyhole.

Hackers are incredibly creative, and you're right, the human mind can't
conceive of the prefect security that another human mind can't defeat.
Undoubtedly they will out-create design docs and security analysis.
The upshot is now instead of defeating just local security, you've
also got to defeat local security and the virtual machine. (However,
assuming an 0-day against the vm was bad enough, you could be introducing
a new vector, but the likelihood is that you're much better off
using them both.)
If the data the attacker is wanting to manipulate is outside the VM
altogether, then the final exploit needed is going to have to be
a VM breakout/remote code execution. However, how we got to there
through the stop-gaps already in place is going to be an exceedingly
high hurdle and perhaps require one of these in your quiver:
So what does that mean? The attacker needs:
1) Be able to defeat or bypass local security
2) Discover you're using a VM
3) Be able to breakout of VM

Howdy Roger,
I thought the original question was asking about an alternative
to torbutton.
No plans to include torbutton in future versions of xB Browser.
The reason we took it out is because it is counter-intuitive
to user behaviors.
Most users don't want a browser for both "anonymous" and "public"
sessions. As an analogy, you may find people prefer to feed their
dogs with different spoons than they themselves use, and it isn't
for lack of a sanitizing dishwasher. So the user seems to prefer
an entirely different disposable session, instead of
"states" as provided by TorButton. Because our focus is user-
oriented instead of design-oriented, elimination of TorButton was
This conveys many benefits, not the least of which being one
less point of failure and zero learning curve for the user. A
greater benefit is that this promotes and enables concurrent
browser usage so the user does not have to give up the browser
they are used to. I feel this significantly increases the chance
that the user will keep on employing a "secure" browser, rather
than being faced with the choice between between having to integrate
and learn something new, or turning off the "warning lights"
and going back to insecure browsing habits. Wow, poor English.
However, a significant distinction has to be made so the users
do not confuse the "secure" browser with their normal browser,
so we introduced the XeroBank Modern firefox theme, based on
the defunct Netscape browser.
More good news, though. At 6.7m download requests, I think we are
now getting a strong idea of the user, and the appropriate threat
model, so it may be time to start writing some papers that
establish the evolutionary principles of xBB.

   to know?

I haven't seen anything back from you yet, so I'll just pre-empt
some things you may want to know about the upcoming release.
Currently XeroBank is officially scheduled to release their
personal privacy services at the end of March. For personal
services, we are going to offer VPN access into our
high-speed network. There are no third parties allowed to
participate in our network, so there is no easy opportunity
for adversaries to sniff our exit node traffic.
We will also be offering anonymous IMAP mail service, so you
can set up a single email address on all your computers, PDA,
iPhone, or whatever device, and the email will all be same
mail box, stored encrypted on our servers.
The next month, everyone will get free encrypted offshore
storage access with their account.
Later in the year, we will be introducing more services for
you to access with your XeroBank account.
The way it works is like this:
You get a monthly balance of x GB / month. You can spend that
balance with VPN, email, storage, or any of our services, in
any amount you like. If you just want to store your files on
our network, that's fine. Just want anonymous email? No problem.
Want to set up not only your home computer on our VPN, but also
your notebook, and to protect your parents or give access to
your lawyer? Go right ahead. Want to do all three at the same
time? We're happy to help. You can have virtually unlimited
connections to our network that simply debit your bandwidth
We will include ready to use OVPN software to anonymize your
entire computer traffic. Additionally, you will be able to
select your exit node country of choice, right from the GUI. I
believe the first set of countries to be available for exit are
USA, Canada, Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany, and Jamaica. We
have been building nice entry nodes. Just yesterday we opened up
a 16 core Xeon, with 16GB ram, and Gigabit uplink.
Because we are using a relay network, meaning that the country
you enter our network from is never the same as the node you exit
from, that P2P users can't use UPNP. So additionally we are adding
a setting in addition to the country selection, for P2P users,
that DOES use UPNP on an unmetered server. So bandwidth hogs can
select our P2P setting and download torrents quickly, and as much
as they like. I think the P2P node is going to be in Sweden.
To go indepth a little more, you get 2 plastic XeroBank cards
that use our VAULTS system. The first card is your Deposit card
and that has your identity/payment information on it. That is
how you get funds into your account or deposit them automatically.
The second card is the Access card, which is how you access your
services It looks just like a credit card, with embossed numbers
and all. You simply type in your Access card number into any of our
software and it automatically downloads your access credentials for
the network. The reason we use two cards is because the Access card
separates your traffic from the identity of the account, meaning you
are anonymous to us or anyone who asks us. We don't know which
Deposit card is linked to which Access card, thanks to VAULTS.
Additionally by having cards, you don't have to carry a USB stick
around. Just keep your xerobank card in your wallet, and
download/install your XeroBank VPN software to the host computer.
Of course, we've also made our software portable so you could carry
it with you if you like, preconfigured to your account. In the event
of loss or theft of your access card, your account won't be
compromised, neither will your identity. The worst is that you lose
your bandwidth for that month.
You may also be pleased to know we have a new version of xB Machine
coming out sometime this month. It will be bootable/liveCD, and no
longer require VMWare. It is the most advanced anonymous pre-buit
operating system ever designed, and hooks right up to XeroBank or
Tor. Kyle Williams has joined our development team to help build
this new tighter, faster, more featured version, which will also
include a torrent client and easy sharing services for moving
downloaded files out of the VM.
As for the windows software developments, xB is about to release
a software suite installer that incorporates xB Browser, xB VPN,
and xB Mail. From the installer, just input your Access card number
and it will handle the rest of the configuration for you. This will
also be the first official unveiling of xB Mail, the anonymous email
client with built-in GPG functionality, and GPG signature verified
And this is just for personal services. In the next few months we
will be releasing our corporate and government level services.
Oh, did I mention we will be giving away 30-day free trials?
Get excited,
Steve Topletz

Tor Community,
  We are working on a news aggregation website that will coalesce
  privacy related matters into a single rich-media website. That
  means technology, politics, business, finance, etc. as they
  relate to solely privacy, typically affecting the individual.
  We are looking for those who might be interested in contributing
  tips or columns on a daily, weekly, or semimonthly basis. Articles
  would be between 150 to 600 words.
  Currently this is a love-of project that is being run without
  profit by those who enjoy privacy. This means those of you who
  want to elevate your public exposure, project, blog, promote a
  service or privacy product that is related will have advertising
  and backlink compensation. If the project becomes monetized, we
  will begin compensating columnists.
  If you are interested, please drop me a line directly.

@_subject: tor-browser bundle on XP 
Phobos et al,
 xB Browser installs giving a user a choice of two modes.
 The first is Tor, the second is the XeroBank network. xB
 Browser is included in the XeroBank Installer bundle which
 includes xB VPN and xB Mail as well.
 xB Browser, if Tor is installed, will just run Tor for it's
 connection client.
 Otherwise, the installer will ask you for credentials and
 lookup your account data to see if it should connect you via
 SSH to XeroBank, or launch an OpenVPN connection to XeroBank,
 or sense you already have an OpenVPN connection and become
 submissive to direct connection, which gets routed out through
 OpenVPN.
 So xB Browser can connect to Tor, any SSH proxy, or any OpenVPN
 proxy, and acts as the privacy browser for the anonymous
 connection you ask it to make.
 Further disambiguation: Xero Networks, the parent company of
 XeroBank, runs both the XeroBank network, and the Onyx network.
 The two are separate, the former being a 2-hop juridictionally
 split, crowded and multiplexed broadband anonymity network, the
 latter being a much more "hardcore" network featuring 3+ hop
 multi-jursidictional, decentralized, distributed, multiplexed,
 cascade split, crowded, lag obfuscated, 1 Gbps burst broadband
 anonymity network. XeroBank network access is offered to
 consumer clients, Onyx network access is offered to business
 and government clients.

XeroBank's network does not use tor whatsoever. Modern onion
  routing is not suitable for commercial anonymity.
  Perhaps the confusion is that our client software is not
  our network software, unlike Tor. xB Browser users do not
  create the XeroBank network. xB Browser only accesses other
  networks as a client.
  So you have this:
  [Browser] -> [Connection Client] -> [Network]
  In the instance of Tor, the connection client and the network
  are essentially the same. In the instance of XeroBank, the
  connection client for legacy users will be PuTTY/SSH to the XB1
  network, and for modern users the connection client will be
  OpenVPN/TLS to the XB2 network.
  Currently xB Browser lets the user select which anonymity
  network they want to use: Tor or XeroBank. This also means
  we could theoretically also add JAP or I2P in as well. It
  is also written to work with the Mozilla softwares, so it
  can easily run a News Reader, Chat client, Mail client,
  or any other in place of the Browser if one was motivated.
  It is somewhat agnostic of the network it connects to except
  for the threat models. Because Tor is vulnerable to exit node
  injection and MITM attacks, it employs a Tor-specific user.js
  option overlay which blocks out scripts and plugins and mime
  types, and RSA/MD5 SSL certificates. When connected to XeroBank's
  VPN the threat model is different so it behaves accordingly, allowing
  scripts, plugins, and mime types, but wiping out flash cookies,
  DOM objects, cookies, hidden registry plugins, and other homing
  badware. It also has a hybrid user option overlay, for the SSH
  connections because it knows there isn't injection/mitm risks
  but it also knows the VPN isn't catching all the traffic so it
  covers up java proxy settings in windows, and restricts scripts,
  and plugins etc at the option of the user, but it doesn't worry
  about RSA/MD5 SSL certificates.
  It was rewritten from scratch a couple years ago, and I don't
  think it has a single line of PortableApps code left in it.
  I think it would be safe to say this is nothing like the Torpark
  you remember.
