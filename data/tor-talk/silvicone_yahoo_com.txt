It is trivial for global passive adversaries, like the government or large telcom companies, to link true sources and true destinations of Tor traffic.
Tor aims to provide anonymity against weaker, local adversaries - and even then, adversaries can win, as investigated in these papers.
Or, for a lot of papers on anonymity,
I would bet it happens more often than we'd like to think, as practical low-cost anonymity is still an open problem.

@_subject: Directory servers for a subset of Tor routers 
Can i configure TOR to use it with some code so i can choose which exit node i want? Something like this:
for( i=0; i<10; i++ )
    retrieve_webpage( URL, TOR_exit_nodes[ i ] );
This code should rotate 10 TOR_exit_nodes to retrieve some webpages with PHP or JavaScript.
 I think this is possible with a little hacking of the code. If you
don't want to make you own version of tor (a bad idea to begin with)
you could run an authoritative dir server and then just block
connections to certain countries. Just make sure you configure your
server NOT to advertise that information to other directories.

 Thanks Comrade - so blocking connections from other countries...is that something that is built into Tor or would I need a 3rd party solution? I think i already saw how to prevent the dir server from advertising itself to the rest of the Tor network in the man pages (yeah, really wouldn't want to screw anyone else up) but not so sure on the geographical part.

@_subject: using or-talk 
Hello. I'm new in your or-talk mailing list and I have subscribed as i would want to find out how can I make TOR to change automaticaly the exit node every time I navigate to a new page. For example, if i navigate 3 pages that link one to each other in this manner:  A to B and B to C, i would want that page A to be loaded through exit-node-1, page B through exit-node-2 and page C through exit-node-3.
Is this possible. I've read that the exit-node changes if the connection stays the  same for a very long time for security reasons. Maybe if i could configure that time to refresh the exit-node option... say it instead after 5 minutes of inactivity to after 1 second.
I also want to say that english is not my first language, so i might not made me understood and i want to ask you politely to be patiente with me. Thanks in advance and i wish you to have a wonderfull day.
