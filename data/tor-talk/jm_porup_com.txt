@_subject: [tor-talk] OTP two-factor auth in TAILS 
Would the TAILS developers consider including `oathtool` in the
next release?
This would enable those of us who run TAILS on DVD to use
2F auth in a secure manner.

I think the likelihood of repositioning the "Dark Web" brand in
people's minds is approximately zero.
I would recommend finding a way to turn the negative into a positive.
Embrace the negative with a joke, for instance:
Use the Dark Web. "Go Over to the Dark Side."

A bit like trying to convince people to use "cracker" instead of "hacker."
A lost cause, unfortunately.
Positioning is about tip-of-the-mind word association. Once positioned,
a negative connotation can be nearly impossible to dislodge. (By "brand"
I mean any word in general use whose meaning you want to manipulate.)
You can try to fork a term, so to speak. But whatever you do, you
have to hack what's actually in people's minds, not what you wish
were in people's minds. That generally mean refactoring the term
is preferable to a fork.
