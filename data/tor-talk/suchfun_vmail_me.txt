some time ago the Bluecoat ProxySG Virtual Appliance was leaked and you could get it through most popular torrent trackers. Unfortunately, nowadays I can't find a single torrent with peers that serve the whole download. The best I could find will give me the thing till 50%.
Does anyone have a torrent that works? Or can someone that has downloaded the whole thing start seeding again?
