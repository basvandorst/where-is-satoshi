UDP does not work on some smart phones because many carriers allow UDP
from the phone (send) but block UDP to the phone (receive). In the US,
you will have probably trouble with Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T (and
likely others).

Mac OS X may not be as simple as it appears. I believe 10.5 offers
32-bit OS that is capable of running 64-bit binaries.
You might need something that considers both hw.cpu64bit_capable and
hw.optional.x86_64. I believe you need to use hw.optional.x86_64 to
determine if 32-bit OS can run the 64-bit binaries.
A good discussion is at "determine if a CPU is Intel 64-bit,"

@_subject: [tor-talk] Firefox Portable and Access Denied on Lock File (Windows, 
Hi All/Mike,
My apologies for spinning up another thread. The original seemed like
it was getting cluttered, and I believe the cause has been found.
In this installation, the Tor bundle was installed in %PROGRAMFILES%.
Specifically, C:\Program Files (x86)\Tor Browser.
If I run "Start Tor Browser.exe" as a regular user, I receive an error
message, "Firefox is already running, but not responding...". See
"tor-firefox-windows-already-running.png" at
When I trace the processes involved (Start Tor, Tor, and Firefox)
using Sysinternal's Process Monitor, it appears Firefox is trying to
write a lock file in %PROGRAMFILES%. The lock file is ...\Tor
Browser\FirefoxPortable\Data\Profile\parent.lock, and it results in an
ACCESS_DENIED. See "tor-firefox-windows-access-denied.png" at
If I run "Start Tor Browser.exe" as an Administrator, the browser works fine.
When the Tor Browser is launched after installation (as part of the
installation), the browser works fine. I believe this is because the
setup/install program is not dropping privileges after it completes.
In this case, FirefoxPortable should probably be writing its lock file
to a temporary directory or the User's application data directory
(CSIDL_APPDATA or FOLDERID_RoamingAppData,
It should not attempt to write to a read/execute directory.

It appears there are no filesystem writes.
It appears there are some writes occurring to the Windows Registry
tracing back to firefox.exe (if interested). A screen capture of what
I observed is available at To trace them under Windows, start Process Monitor
( and
add the following filters:
  * "Process Name", "is", "Start Tor Browser.exe", include
  * "Process Name", "is", "tor.exe", include
  * "Process Name", "is", "firefox.exe", include
  * "Operation", "is not", "RegSetValue", exclude
Well, I'm not a big fan of access() checks in software due to races.
Plus, they tend to be somewhat complex in Windows - you have to fetch
a DACL and loop over ACLs looking for allow and deny ACEs. Its usually
better and easier to try the operation and then handle the
ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED gracefully.
Also, an install time check may not provide intended results. If a
user installs to Desktop and later drags to Program Files, then the
user will experience the same issue.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Change Data Directory on Mac OS X? 
Hi All,
I have Tor installed in /Applications, and the Settings specify a Data
Directory of /Applications/TorBrowser_en-US.app/Contents/Resources/Data/Tor.
How does one change so so each user gets his/her own data directory?
Does Tor perform shell/variable expansion?

Hi All,
If this is the wrong group for the question, please let me know.
