@_subject: Pidgin with TOR 
hi all,
i am using the pidgin with ubuntu. and i installed TOR as well.
i want to set up TOR to one of the yahoo accounts in pidgin.
so i went to proxy settings and changed the gnome proxy setttings into
socks5 and host 127.0.0.1 and port 9050.
but each time i restart pidgin the yahoo account wont' start. i think
its may be due to yahoo email is opened?
how can i solve the problem?
thank you very much.

for some reason i cannot set the proxy setting globally,
the button is greyed out (disable)
i mean:
tools>preference>network and under proxy server and browser it says
proxy configuration program was not found and proxy and browser
preferences are configured in gnome prefernces. two buttons are there,
configure proxy and configure browser,
the configure proxy button is disabled.
thank you.

@_subject: A suggestion to TOR [a proxy server] 
hi all,
i would like to suggest TOR to build some sort of online system,
like a proxy server. where ppl just come and enter the address in the
text box and hit 'surf with tor' or something. so that the same
objective is achieved as in running the TOR client.
its easier for pcs and mobile devices as well (as most mobile devices
still don't support TOR).
and i think, this can be a step towards the increasing trend of cloud
computing, if i have correctly understood what is cloud computing. :D
