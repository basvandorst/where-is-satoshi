Actually, I was thinking to show the bandwidth of a circuit, without
additional infos, to estimate how fast a circuit may be.
If I understand well you are interested in knowing the tcp / udp ports contacted by exit connections ?
OK but remember my objective wasn't to collect statistics continuously. Of course, it would be available while monitor run.
I took note, I think relay's admin would be helped a lot with theses Thanks you very much for your suggestions, they are relevant, and I would enjoy to have such data available for my relay :)

@_subject: GSoC proposal 
I published two proposals to work with Tor during the Google Summer of Code.
The first one is about coding "moniTor", a top-like tool showing data on a Tor relay. You can see my complete proposal here :  and in the Google webapp.
The second proposal is about porting OnionCoffee (Java implementation of Tor) to Android, and update it to support latest Tor's protocols. The complete proposal :  About me : I am a 26 years old student at Universit? Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, France, in M.S. computer science named "applications & computers networks".
I hope you will find my proposals interesting. Don't hesitate to give me a comment.
