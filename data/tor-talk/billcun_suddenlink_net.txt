For the life of me I can't get the tor browser to open. It will not even  start let alone install. I don't know what's going on. I have an XP x64. I think it's supposed to work with that. What can I be doing wrong?

Hello,
I posted a little while back about my XP x64 not opening Tor. I wrote to tor's help desk too and received no answer. I installed .NET version 4.0 and tor still wouldn't open. I have googled and can't find anything. Would anyone maybe have an idea as to what's up?

  Tor doesn't need .NET framework. Where did you download your Tor
  package? It appears you installed malware/adware pretending to be Tor.

Yes. I contacted the help desk. They do not respond. I did so immediately after he said too. And downloading from the link he sent, doesn't work either.

  Bill,
  Yeah, I've never received a response from any torproject email address.
  You're officially part of the club!
  I will re-post the first half of Soul Plane's very first remark.
  "To get help I think you will have to give more information"
  We need more information!
 "It will not even start let alone install."
  So, let's start at the beginning. Step by step. You downloaded the exe,
  you double clicked on it, then what?
  1) You downloaded Tor Browser from Tor's website[0]
  2) You double clicked the .exe
  3)
      Nothing happens. It doesn't do anything. No processes begin to open the download.
  Some more questions:
  - Is this a work or personal computer?
  PC
  - Is your anti-virus running? Is your anti-virus up to date?
  no and no
  - Have you tried temporarily disabling your AV while installing?
  I do not use antivirus software.
  - Is your Windows User account Limited/Standard, or Admin?
  admin
  - Can you install other software without issue?
  yes
  - Have you taken a look at Event Viewer? What does it say?
  no
  - Did you verify the download using the signature?
  no
  [0]    or

Well one thing I did was get something called gpg4win or something like that. I think it said it didn't recognize the code from the asc file. I don't know what that means.

  I feel bad replying to this whole list so could someone email me personally
  for a little advice on how to start running the Onion VPN because I'm not
  super computer savvy and I need some help.

and on I did not know. Never usesd "Keys". But I have the gp44win know. I will let you know the results. After having "imported the keychain" If that's the correct wording. How does this download site work for others and not me? I am showing my ignorance I know, but I don't know why.

  Bill,
  It appears you have the answer. If you followed all of the instructions,
  and you did not get a successful response, then you do not have the
  correct/complete/valid download.
  You don't seem to be a fan of following instructions, so I will try to
  be particularly explicit in these instructions; it's almost verbatim
  from the website.
  1) You downloaded GnuPG from   2) You downloaded torbrowser-install-4.5.3_en-US.exe *and*
  torbrowser-install-4.5.3_en-US.exe.asc into the same folder.
  2.1) I'm going to pretend you saved them to the following location -
  replace it with the actual location where you saved these 2 files
  C:\Users\User\Downloads\Tor\
  3) From cmd.exe, you ran the following command
  "C:\Program Files\Gnu\GnuPg\gpg.exe" --keyserver
  x-hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0x4E2C6E8793298290
  4)You then ran the following command
  "C:\Program Files\Gnu\GnuPg\gpg.exe" --fingerprint 0x4E2C6E8793298290
  5) You saw the following response:
  pub   4096R/93298290 2014-12-15
      Key fingerprint = EF6E 286D DA85 EA2A 4BA7  DE68 4E2C 6E87 9329 8290
  uid                  Tor Browser Developers (signing key)
  sub   4096R/F65C2036 2014-12-15
  sub   4096R/D40814E0 2014-12-15
  sub   4096R/589839A3 2014-12-15
  6) You then ran the following command (Of course replacing with the
  actual location of where you saved the files)
  "C:\Program Files\Gnu\GnuPg\gpg.exe" --verify
  C:\Users\User\Downloads\Tor\torbrowser-install-4.5.3_en-US.exe.asc
  C:\Users\User\Downloads\Tor\torbrowser-install-4.5.3_en-US.exe
  7) You did not receive the following response
  gpg: Signature made Tue 24 Jan 2015 09:29:09 AM CET using RSA key ID
  D40814E0
  gpg: Good signature from "Tor Browser Developers (signing key) "
  gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
  gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the
  owner.
  Primary key fingerprint: EF6E 286D DA85 EA2A 4BA7  DE68 4E2C 6E87 9329 8290
  8) You do not have the correct/complete/valid download.
  9) Try again. Repeat steps  until you do see the *Good Signature*
  response in   Good luck.

Ok looks like a problem. I did a lot of work texting and trying to pipe out results to post. It went into an empty file. The verify results couldn't verify anything. All the numbers were wrong. Warning this file could not be verified or something like that came up.

  Hi,
  Maybe also check DEP settings.
  1. Click Start, click Control Panel, and then double-click System. (or
  right-click My Computer and choose Properties)
  2. Click the Advanced tab. Then, under Performance, click Settings.
  3. Click the Data Execution Prevention tab.
  4a. Click, Turn on DEP for essential Windows programs and services
  only, to select the OptIn policy.
  *or*
  4b.  Click, Turn on DEP for all programs and services except those I
  select,  to select the OptOut policy. Click Add and add the
  applications  exceptions that you do not want to use DEP with.
  I would recommend (4a) for testing if DEP is the problem.

I have solved the problem. I happened to click properties of the file. The words "This file has been blocked because it came from another computer" was there. This has never happened. I unblocked it and it starts to install. Thanks.

Now I am noticing that a lot of things seem to come up wanting you to type a validation code. I went to google and it wanted that. Is that wise? bridges.torproject.org wants validation too.

  This is common behaviour as half of the internet trusts cloudflare and
  other "DDoS protection" providers with their traffic. These have
  built-in anti-Tor measures to make life miserable for people who want
  anonymity and privacy.
