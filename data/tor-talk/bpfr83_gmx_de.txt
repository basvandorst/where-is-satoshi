@_subject: We need more SILC-enabled relay servers! 
hi listmembers,
as you can read at the subject, it would be nice if much more exitrouter-admins would allow
dport 706 (SILC), so its possible again to connect to the SILC network!
((what ar u talking about guy, you ask? ----) SILC in conjunction with tor (and tsocks) its such a powerfull solution for secure&anonymous liveconferencing that it will kicks all censors asses very strong! :-)
best regards netzpython / .de
