@_subject: [tor-talk] circuit connections 
I am running tor as middle relay configured by vidalia. So it is obvious
that number of circuits are made through my middle OR. so now I want to
know the total number of circuits made through my OR. Is it possible to
count those number of circuits?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why adding Guard-Exit (EE) node in Tor yeild more catch 
I am trying to observe the catch probability i.e. probability that a client
selects my added guard as well as exit node while making a circuit.
First I inserted certain number of guard nodes and certain number of exit
nodes in Tor network and performed the simulation in Shadow simulator.
After completion of simulation, I calculated the catch probability.
Then again I added the same number of Guard-Exit (EE) node and perform the
simulation and calculated the probability.
I found that catch probability for EE nodes are much higher than those of
guard and exit node separately.
Could anyone please explain why this happened?

Hi Matt,
If I understand correctly, you ran a simulation where you had x nodes which
had the Guard flag and y exit nodes..
then you ran another simulation where you had (x+y) exit nodes which also
had the Guard flag? Is this correct?
In simulation, there is node which has both Guard and exit flag, so called
guard-exit node (EE node). I put (x+y) EE node and ran the simulation.
Please refer to the shadow wiki below
Here you can see Guard+Exit relays.

@_subject: [tor-talk] About bandwidth weights selection 
While choosing a possible guard, a client multiplies Wgg with the bandwidth
weight of a possible relay having guard flag.
But if a client wants to choose a relay, for guard position, having both
Guard and Exit flag (EE), then will it multiply bandwidth weight with Wgg
or Wgd?

Guard+Exit flagged node for guard position?

The following is the default Tor network in shadow simulator:
Total BW of Guard flagged nodes=258.15 MB/S
Total BW of Middle nodes=23.69 MB/S
Total BW of Exit flagged nodes=13.23 MB/S
Total BW of Guard+Exit flagged nodes=213.4 MB/S
Now, I inserted 40 guard nodes and 40 exit nodes, each of 5 MB/S in above
Tor network and performed the simulation.
Following are the bandwidth weights derived from the consensus document
when Guard and Exit nodes of 5MB/S are added separately:
Wbd=1454 Wbe=0 Wbg=4882 Wbm=10000 Wdb=10000 Web=10000 Wed=7091 Wee=10000
Weg=7091 Wem=10000 Wgb=10000 Wgd=1454 Wgg=5118 Wgm=5118 Wmb=10000 Wmd=1454
Wme=0 Wmg=4882 Wmm=10000
Then again, I added 80 Guard-Exit (EE) nodes, each 5MB/S and perform the
Following are the bandwidth weights derived from the consensus document
when EE nodes of 5MB/S are added:
Wbd=4722 Wbe=0 Wbg=0 Wbm=10000 Wdb=10000 Web=10000 Wed=4826 Wee=10000
Weg=4826 Wem=10000 Wgb=10000 Wgd=452 Wgg=10000 Wgm=10000 Wmb=10000 Wmd=4722
Wme=0 Wmg=0 Wmm=10000
I calculated catch probability in both cases and found that the 2nd case
yields more probability.
By examining the above weights, how it is possible that the catch
probability for EE nodes are much higher than those of guard and exit node
separately? OR is there any other reason for this?
Can anybody please explain this?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Role of Bandwidth weight 
I studied about section 3.5.3 computing bandwidth weights in Tor Directory
Protocol Version 3. I know now how to compute the values of these weights.
1) I am not able to understand how these values are used in path selection
by the client. Anybody please highlight on this.
2) There are guard flagged nodes, Exit flagged nodes and Guard+Exit flagged
nodes in Tor network which are used in guard position and exit position
while making circuit by the client. I know that for choosing guard flagged
node in guard position, weight Wgg is used, for choosing exit flagged node
in exit position, Wee is used, and for choosing Guard+Exit flagged node,
Wgd or Wed is used. lets say that Wgd < Wgg and Wed < Wee. Then how is it
that G+E flagged node be choosen in guard position or exit position?

He has mentioned about bandwidth weights WG and WE, responsible for node
But in the Tor directory protocol version 3, there is no such mention of

Dear sir/madam,
I am a  graduate student at Chosun University in South Korea. I am
interested in developing anti-attack mechanism for TOR. So with that
motive, I started learning about TOR. But I am not able to understand about
the bandwidth weights.
It is said that bandwidth weights are used for network load balancing.
These appear only once in the consensus. So would you please highlight me
on the following queries:
What do they signify?
How are they used actually in the field?
How these values helps in network load balancing?
How bandwidth values are calculated from the four sets of equations given?
Thank you in advance.

@_subject: [tor-talk] About Bandwidth thottling 
Does ISP throttles the Bandwidth which is donated to TOR network? For e.g. I
am operating OR as an exit on 10 MegaBytes/s speed network. But when
checking from atlas.torproject.org, it shows only 1MBps Advertised
Bandwidth. Is it due to throttling of bandwidth by my ISP?
I am running as exit node since 1 month and have set 10485760 for
RelayBandwidthRate and MaxAdvertisedBandwidth.

@_subject: [tor-talk] About Bandwidth thottling 
So does it mean that if a node is far from directory authority then the
advertised bw of that node is always low.
In this case that node can't donate the bw it is willing to donate.
