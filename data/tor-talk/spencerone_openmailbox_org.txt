@_subject: [tor-talk] All I Want For X-mas: TorPhone 
Hello everybody,
With all of the great development happening around the Tor network this holiday season, it seems fitting to ask for something that would help me out tremendously: TorPhone.
We have a great back-end network, a sweet browser for most platforms [f/iOS & WP], and a kick-ass portable OS, just to name a few.  However, these do not necessarily meet my needs, and I presume the needs of many others, when on the road, which I am always on.
I propose, and please point me in the correct direction if I am overlooking something that already exists, a bare-bones WiFi-only mobile Ideally it would run an open OS tied to an open organization and come with nothing installed on it except for a mobile version of TorBrowser. The best example I can think of now is a forked version of Android with Orweb/bot installed.  Other applications could be installed at the discretion of the human, like F-Droid and whatnot, presuming they meet the security ethics of the network.
I could take most any Android device and only use WiFi but most offerings are through a cellular service provider on a WiFi-only SIM.  I could also just avoid using a cellular SIM altogether but the devices still come preloaded with all kinds of stuff that do things I don't want them to, like tracking and reporting, most of which can only be disabled, not uninstalled, at least not by me.  I could also throw an Android alternative on it but in most cases that requires entering into a contract with the manufacturer regarding the now unlocked bootloader, let alone the learning curve of actually doing so.  And I could get a device that comes without a locked bootloader like a Jolla running Sailfish or a OnePlus running CyanogenMod, though they are also quite tied to either a manufacturer or a provider, or both.  If Android isn't the best option, what is?
Knowing very little about compiling or securing software, like most people, this out of the box experience seems quite valuable.
If this is a reasonable request, and if this is the right place to make such a request, I am all aboard with assisting development in anyway that I can; form development, mechanical engineering, interface, experience, packaging, whatever...I just want to see a truly usable mobile device in my hand, and the hands of others.
Any thoughts?
Happy Holidays!

Though a tablet could work, I am more for a more pocket-sized mobile device. Also, Seth, thanks for the more in-depth concern regarding the WiFi MAC address and guard nodes, however, though I am all for people knowing how their devices work and why, the details of that kind of stuff is a bit over my head, even if I know what they are.
The Blackphone and the Jolla are definitely not all they are cracked up to be, but I was unaware of the Open Handset Alliance terms.  It doesn't, from my perspective, break the ecosystem of Android applications, just Google's, which are broken by design; no loss there.  But if the API is tied to Google applications and not to Android applications, I can see the issue.
Ubuntu is also broken, in that you need to be a developer/engineer to do much of anything, at least that has been my experience, as well as the experience of other [Mac] users, with 13.x. Though ditching the Oracle stuff seems like a plus.  But do people have absolute control, or is it mitigated by providers/manufacturers?
Replicant, though still Android, could be an option since some devices are now supporting WiFi, though they are mostly Samsung and Google :(  Though there is still that huge laborious learning curve. Where does this fit into the OHA terms? I know Cyanogen is all Googled up.  Thanks, Alexis, for the insight.
Definitely a need for TorPhone.

Thanks for the link, Chuck!  Unfortunately, at least for me, that approach isn't sufficient, as it requires one of the most broken devices ever regarding basic functionality and still allows Google services, even if disabled.  Not to mention the learning curve.  Not that I am against learning or working for my goal but I have tried similar things in the past and, in comparison, having no device is just so much better.   Though I hope you get a TShirt :)  I have been working on a few, though none are good enough to share, yet.
Seth, thanks a bunch for the super duper in-depth insight.  I feel you on the MAC address IDing, as I have always hated my ISP being able to see every device on my "private" home and business networks. I have been wishing for a TorBlock device that would allow my ISP to see my modem, or modem/router combo, only, while giving a big ol' Fuck You to any request to see other connected devices, unless, that is, I choose to allow specific device access for troubleshooting.  Whether it is a separate, and very small, box that middlemans between the modem and the WiFi router, or is ware firmed into the modem/router combo.
But are you saying that even though my IP is obfuscated my device WiFi ID is still visible?  Maybe "other people" is unclear.  Or, maybe I thought I understood something I actually do not, which is seeming to be the case.
Maybe, in addition to the awesomeness that is Atlas, at least what's in the TorButton in TorBrowser-4.5-Alpha-2, we have a greater visualization of things.  More specifically, exactly what each node, and maybe the final destination, sees.  This could help, in addition to addressing the guard node issues in some way, assist TorBrowser users in changing their habits, or at least know what habits could lead to certain levels of I wasn't aware of Whonix, so thanks, but TAILS seems to have a mobile device option if you throw it on an SD card, though it appears to require plugging into a laptop, but I might be mistaken.

Arxaios, I think you may be confusing cannot with should not.   Though, regarding TorPhone, it is established that WiFi and cellular antenna connections as a means of communication are by nature able to track people, as that seems to be how they work.  However, I do not think that implies that we should give up.
Though they would still share your location, encrypted or not, we could put hardware switches on TorPhone, allowing people to physically disable their WiFi and cellular antennas as easily as adjusting the audio volume.  This could also apply to other things, like non-removable batteries, as a way of ensuring that no connections can be made.  Even just a network filter would assist people in limiting, or cutting off completely, network connections, especially those which share location And, regarding your "first rule" of back doors and open systems as a safety, rules are meant to be broken :)
Nathan, thanks!  I am familiar with Orwall, though configuring applications to route traffic through Orbot isn't a walk in the park for most people, since their is a warning about using non-tor configured applications on the site.  Many people don't even understand what root access is, let alone be able to achieve it.  Tomy sounds cool.  Though, from what I can read, it has a ways to go.  Also, there is the limitation for many people of not understanding having a second partition/OS on their device.  If it came pre-installed and could be switched over to at will with a gesture or two, then that could be super cool and easy to manage.
Giovanni, Janus sounds great, but very esoteric and a lot to learn, at least for most people.

But, to understand more, are the other onion routing projects implementing their own onion routing protocol or are they implementing Tor? I could investigate this myself but I don't know enough to figure out the difference unless explicitly stated.

Awesome, the Transport Layer, right?  But couldn't things on the Application Layer be filtered through Tor before they make it to the Network Layer?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor as a network filter 
Yes, "..separate identification from routing.?, but isn't Tor filtering my connection to the internet by routing my connection through its network?  Because, if so, I am wondering if it is possible to have that onion routing process do more than just automatically proxy my connection.  I am thinking it could allow me to deny certain connection attempts completely while allowing others.  If applications can make connections to the internet through the Tor network, via Orbot or TorBirdy, for example, how much control can I have over this on a desk/laptop environment?
Where would I look to find information on this?  Is Vidalia or "system Tor" relevant to this?
Okay, but in between one application, TorBrowser, and an entire OS, Whonix, there is all, or at least desired, application control.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Giving Hidden Services some love 
I do not agree that to understand what hidden services do that one must use them or find using them interesting.  I, as well as many ancient astronaut theorists, contend, that the explanation on the Tor Project's Hidden Services section of their website needs to be more ... something [I was thinking 'Clear', but if you understand the concepts, then it is most likely quite clear].
It starts out with a very simple claim about anonymity being the purpose of using hidden services, but then, as it goes on to explain how that works, it gets a bit confusing, mentioning things like "rendezvous points", "relays", "circuits", "introduction points", "hidden service descriptors", "public keys", "distributed hash tables", "XYZ=16characters.onion", "one-time secrets" "introduce/rendezvous messages", "entry guards", "entry nodes", & "end-to-end encryption/decryption", which do not make sense to most people [Dad].
To me, understanding some of these concepts, it seems like a closed network that overlays the internet protocol with a security blanket.  But is this accurate?  Is this needed?  How does this differ from p2p, or does it then become p2p?  Is it comparable to Dotcom's Meganet, which is supposed to be non IP?  Other than not using the exit relays, what value does it provide that Tor on the regular web does not?  Also, and this goes in a slightly different direction so ignore, why is Tor using some relays to exit and not all?
I would like to communicate p2p but if scrambling my middleman connections is the better [more secure] option then I would like to know.  Also, does this series of relays count as a third party, ultimately classifying my content [whatever I am communicating] as public knowledge?
Also, I think saying "Hey, fbook uses it." does nothing to help people map the concept in their mind.

Thanks for the passionate response, but it seems like you are reconfirming the need for TorPhone.  It seems that only by choice this "rule" is followed.  Unless it is the nature of an open programming language to write what you want, malicious or not, which I think it is, I certainly do not understand the "backdoor" you are referring to [classification and experience are not requirements to understanding concepts if they are explained clearly].  It seems obvious that if someone can make it, someone can break it.  But that doesn't mean we should not pursue better security and freedom than we already have with our mobile devices.
Happy New Year to you, too.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Giving Hidden Services some love 
Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions!  In a broader sense, it appears as if I do understand the concept of Tor Hidden Services, an anonymity overlay of the Internet Protocol.  I referred to a security blanket since I thought we were securing our anonymity using Tor, but your description seems to be a bit more accurate anyway.
Though I do think, after reading your response, that I understand your statement about "know[ing] what a hidden service can do to benefit".  Knowing what a HS can do, beneficially, only explains that service, not the concept of Tor Hidden Services at large.  The concept of anonymity, at least in the case of TorBrowser, is the key to grasping the concept/value of Tor Hidden Services, especially if using a similar example to your relay w/buttons scenario, where in one case you secure anonymity in a closed all encrypted network, and, in another, you secure anonymity within that same closed all encrypted network but run a higher risk of losing your anonymity by exiting the network into the regular web [which you entered from as well], though in both cases you do have some level of anonymity. So, I contend, that an actual explanation of what things are and how they work is the most effective, especially in the face of "this service that you are familiar with uses Tor Hidden Services", as that still requires an explanation of "for what?" and maybe "How?", not to mention what Tor Hidden Services actually is.
But, you are correct, that this certainly doesn't mean that someone [Dad] should understand all of the concepts and terms that I pulled from the Tor Hidden Services Document.  So, maybe somewhere in the middle is Though, regarding a mental map, I do not mean of a site, just of what a hidden service is compared to a non-hidden service on the regular web.  However, now that I have considered it, the descriptor of 'Hidden Service' is what is confusing, as it doesn't map as accurately back to a 'Non-hidden Service' as it could without saying that all of the internet is non-hidden services.  Maybe describing the TorHS more like you did, an anonymity network that overlays, or is contained within, the Internet Protocol, is most accurate, though this might require understanding more about how the .onion TLdomain works in a browser.  Security [anonymity] can exist in the open.

But what about the before the connection, even preventing the connection?  Doesn't Orbot or Tor Browser provide an opportunity to manage what is sent?  Can firewall-like control be implemented into somethinglike this?
I have been, thanks to many kind people on this list taking their time to help :)  This is why I am asking questions, to better understand the I understand the network as you are describing it.  Regarding "filter" I am seeing it from a non-technical user point of view, where it appears as if the user's address has been removed and a new one has been provided, as they might often receive the message "Your IP address appears to be:...".  Given that a filter can be seen as software that reformats some stuff, experientially, in this case, the user's identity has been reformatted, even if technically it's just being swapped for that of the exit's.
But I am more asking if Tor can be used as part of a filter, with some sort of application allowing for more control, maybe even of what is sent to the entry.  It seems there has been some discussion regarding 'Tor Router/Firewall', though it's only cited as a bullet in a list. I might be misreading, but a Tails document refers to a 'Network Filter'.  I don't only want to allow or deny network connections, like with Tails, but filter out certain things as well, maybe with something smaller like a browser or application firewall.
Awesome, but isn't Orbot something like this?  And didn't Vidalia provide similar functionality?
I am, as touched on above, is there any value to combining incoming access to the Tor network and outgoing connections from applications as a standalone tool?  Vs using Little Snitch or built-in firewalls separately from a Tor application like Tor Browser.

You will always have to take others at their word, but trust in others is only going to get us so far, especially with software, which most people who use it don't understand.
Because this is a problem software alone can't resolve, we need hardware solutions, too.  For example, with microphones and GPS/RT antennas, a mechanical switch could help ensure privacy/security when employed and shut off.  As for keyloggers and malware, some sort of scan/detect filter could be beneficial, though a more technical person would have to validate the plausibility/value of this suggestion.

Is a 'Natural Fingerprint' like a clearnet fingerprint, in that it identifies you as a regular, non-tor, internet user, making you part of the larger herd?
I see this as a blocker, as this add-on is most likely detectable, yeah?   If not, how, in the same, less, or maybe a bit more, amount of resources do you feel this could be accomplished?  Manually, this becomes quite the task as time progresses.  Is this something that would be added to a mail [something], like OpenPGP or TorBirdy are, because I feel like this would be detectable somehow, too.
This seems to be part of the design, as one-of-a-kind fingerprints, through Tor exits or not, are detectable, though probably not Randomization, or some one click equivalent, is the only real option here when usability is considered; the manual effort each session is undesirable at the very least :)
'UnidentifiableMode' sounds like a good working name for such a feature.
Making people blend into the crowd of regular internet users is best but only if we resolve the traffic source; i.e., Tor exits.
But surely some of these fingerprints will be shared by real users.  So, it seems like a reasonable request, should we resolve the usability and *traffic issues.

They suck (time and energy).  They seem to only come in robot discrimination form.
Thanks for doing this.  Here are some thoughts:
??Have them keep a "for everybody" version of what current IP threat scores are, like on a dedicated webpage, as well as provide the criteria with which they determine the number that gets a defined security level (They might do something similar, but I couldn't find it).  Basically, as much as they will publish.  A block chain might  be useful here, IDK.
??For those without JS the text-only captchas are often too difficult.  It would be nice if they implemented something more visual, like with their JS captchas.  Something cool like what George Kadianakis was considering for another purpose[0] would be fun.
??They could just not use JS at all.  I am sure they could do cool, usable stuff with PHP, Pearl, or something.  IDK, maybe not.
??See if they have any research on this [1].
? If they can detect the previous site visited, or other tabs open, using this, or other human-like tells, to verify that visitors are "Human" would be nice.
??Also, as a Cloudflare user, having security level 'Off' actually function as off would be nice, instead of "off will act only against the most grievous offenders".
??And not having their transparency available only in a fragmented series of blog posts [2].
I hope some of this can provide value :)

True, if this read: "This will never be solved by patching Tor", as it is the discriminators who must stop discriminating that will really change things.
"Regular" users, as a concept, might be part of the problem.  "Regular" users are what drive the existence of the very service providers that seek such protection; they should not receive hierarchical priority over those they *serve*.

I have been defining fingerprint as any bit of info that can identify you, which can be any number of things.  I have been defining clearnet fingerprint as the identifying bit of info defining someone as a clearnet user, such as a common User Agent.
This would be a Tor Browser fingerprint, but I understand you mean fingerprinting of Tor Browser to differentiate between Tor Browser By choice, though, yeah?  It still seems valuable.
You should draft this into a proposal, with some visuals of the interface and experience flows, and submit it to the list in search for a developer, unless you can bust this out yourself?  I can help anyway that I can.  If you are interested, hit me up off-list.
Otherwise, unless there is something more tangible, I feel like people will keep arguing that Tor is fine as-is :)

The various bits that define your fingerprint.
No need to spoof traffic if using real fingerprint variables.
I feel like behavior will address the examples for this argument.
True, but we can come up with other ideas than using the public Tor But it is, and I agree :)
But this is the case for everybody everywhere.
With the fingerprint, isn't it only valuable over multiple sessions, and if others aren't also using that same ID?
I don't see this being an add-on as much as being in the settings options (which can probably be detected?) where the User Agent is located.  The User Agent would be a nice way to simplify the various The IDs can be open-source and added to other browsers as a standard way of providing detectability.

Yes, but discrimination is unsupported and avoidable.
No spoof.
Quite the presumption :(
And as a result, Tor Browser owns up to its ID with no spoofing, as Tor Browser users appear a Tor Browser users.
Or using the internet.  What if the OP is tired of being rejected from visiting sites due to IP badlists and uses said proxy to appear like a clearnet user so as not to be restricted.  Google products (except for Google Images) require this.  Ix Quick and Startpage feature this.
Again with the presumptions :(:(
Will you link to the use cases and threat models in the documentation?
Fail often to succeed sooner :)
My thought is that this is being mentioned in multiple places and, if there is any merit to undetectability, we should challenge it fully to see; not settle with what we have and use "good enough" as an argument.  I suggested a formal proposal as the next step.

Word.  It seems that the standard minimum for a web browser is 'Full network access', 'Read the content of your USB storage', and 'Modify or delete the contents of your USB storage'.  Have you scoped the preferences you might be including, if any?
Will bookmarks be removed, given the limited functionality and their potential role in fingerprinting?  Can they be (functionally, not technically)?  Or can a dialog display a warning similar to browser resizing of current Tor Browser releases if they cannot?

There are two ends to this spectrum:
Keep Guard - - - - - - Change Guard
'Keep Guard' keeps the same guard forever (unlikely, given that guards go offline and need replaced)
'Change Guard' changes the entry guard at every circuit (unlikely, given that we have theoretical equations defending against this)
Everything in between is what we have now, some are noted here [0].
Making decisions for people (users) is futile.
Providing people with the ability to control their circuit is the most usable resolution.

SD Cards work quite well for flashing...I am unfamiliar with any downsides to this experience; will you expand on your statement?
Tails-like reservations I do have are with the "Amnesic" functionality, as virtual RAM seems to be the only way to achieve this on Android, and I am unfamiliar with the limitations of actually doing so.
Y'all already have LUKS for Android, and "Live" is more or less perception-based, so it doesn't seem that far off, especially if the intended thoroughness of ioerror's work is adopted; what does everything really do, and so on.
AOSP instead of CM; good move, though it isn't apparent why only the two Nexus devices are supported; AOSParadox tries to address this, it seems.
This is cool as a complete effort; the full Hardware:hardware:Software:Firmware stack, and all, but requires quite the old operational try, one my Dad ain't too fond of.
Are there documented attempts with Windows mobile devices?  I am not familiar with success at doing much of anything in this respect with the N900 or its nicer counterpart, the N9.
This can be part of the experience on any platform, really.

Anonymous: [adjective] 1. without name; having no outstanding, individual, or unusual features.
This definition aligns with the initial onion routing feature of separating identification from routing, and the current public features of Tor Browser.
However, since there is an anonymity spectrum, a more verbose descriptor of what Tor is would be nice :D  Though I feel like it would be a more fine-grained definition of 'anonymity network'.
Obfuscation is a security tactic, so I guess it depends on what type of +1 for the game theory approach.  When it comes to security, probable risk analysis doesn't cut it.
Frame of reference; very important.  This is most likely why people conflate 'anonymous' with 'unknown'.
Regarding assurances [0], Juan's definition of anonymity, and arguments thereof [perspectives many hold], seem accurate.
