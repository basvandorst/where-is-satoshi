@_subject: Potential attack by associating onymous & anonymous traffic 
An example:
An attacker knows that I use the AIM account malglico. I am doing this through Tor (to hide my location or just out of ethusiasm for tsocks). I am also using Tor to transmit something else that I do not want to be revealed as the sender of.
This attacker is able to observe all or some endpoints to the network. They notice that some traffic from malglico is coming from a particular Tor exit. At the same time they notice that the sensitive information I am transmitting is also exiting from there. They can immediately narrow the sender to me or one of the other users exiting from that OR. They have my identify, and the 1 over the number of users exiting from that OR probability that I sent it. This is considerably better than all users on tor who sent message close to that size out.
The simplest solution would be to send all my onymous traffic unproxied,    but maybe I want to hide my location. I can't in the current implementation. If the Tor daemon were able to group the traffic, ie this this and this can be sent down the same circuit, but this must be seperated, I would be able to hide my location in some cases and my entire identity in others.
Do I have a potential privacy concern here or did I miss something? I've only RTFS'd briefly.

Why not? It would seem to me that increasing path length would increase
the strength of anonymity by increasing the number of keys that would
need to be cracked/stolen. What attack defeats this?

My response to these questions is always that speech is never wrong, and
only actions are. You can send kiddy porn over Tor, but Tor doesn't help
with the actual abuse. You can organize an attack over Tor, but you
can't attack people over it. Simply, Tor can't be used for any crime
except crimes of speech. It's up to you to decide whether or not those
are really crimes that you want to stop or not. I personally don't think so.

Done for the moment, but I think a better option would be to have some
sort of QOS routing, so bulk transfers don't clog the network.
And Roger, I think there's something wrong with either your or my gpg.

Hash: SHA1
I think the best solution would be to a have a tool which allowed you to
launch programs torified (via tsocks most likely) but with DNS and a
profile selection screen. The profiles could then plug in to different
SOCKS4A proxies running on the daemon, each with their own circuits.
Preferably this would be cross-platform and easy to use. I can look at
the tsocks code(*nix specific AFAICT) and try to improve it and then
write a wrapper. The code for running multiple SOCKS4A proxies(separate
threads?) should be relatively simple.
I probably won't be able to get to making tsocks more useful for a while
as I'm still a C/*nix programming novice.

Hash: SHA1
I realize tsocks isn't cross-platform, however I don't see any way that
something low-level like this(intercepting library calls) could be. We
will probably have to think of seperate implementations for various
OSes. I only have a linux machine though, so I'll only be able to do
linux and similar *nixes. Obviously OSX isn't similar enough.

I'm not sure if you realized this or not, but by sending a message

compromised your hidden services' anonymity.

It removes anonymity and replaces it with pseudonymity. If this becomes
available it should be optional. Write the patch, but try and think of a

@_subject: (FWD) Dynamic DNS Voodoo Documentation - Draft 
Okay, on the dynamic DNS section, not all routers can update it themselves. I use a program called ddclient. Here are the steps for installing and getting it working. Under windows, there is a different software client, available from the dyndns webpage, that I know nothing about.
1. Install ddclient. Under debian you can type apt-get install ddclient. You will be changing the debian installed configuration later, so just ignore the prompts. Make sure however, that you set it to launch on boot as a daemon.
2. Configure ddclient. Since you are most likely behind a NAT, you don't actually know your IP adress. Therefore, you will set ddclient to get it from the internet. Copy in the following configuration file, to /etc/ddclient substituting your actual login, password and hostname.
3. Check it. You can ping your hostname to see if it works.
Also, in the port forwarding section, on my router you see a two port fields. In the document it claims these are for forwarding ranges of ports, but on my system they are for translating an outside port to an inside port. I use this to allow clients to connect on port 443, while having tor actually listen on 9001.

@_subject: silky and tor 
My uninformed guess is that silc servers send ssl/tls certificates and the cert being for the real server hostname while the client is connecting to localhost is causing it to think that it's invalid. I don't use SILC though, so I don't know. Can you try with another client and see if it complains about certificates?
