I would assume that it would involve maintaining a decent list of smaller jobs ( people undertaking lager tasks are most likely going to know what needs doing already).
Maybe a specific mailing list for this type of thing? I'd imagine it'd get noisy on something like tor-talk.
for those "volunteering" for its certain larger needs / desires?
This is volunteering, I don't think its something that deserves monetary compensation.?
Just my 2 cents.

How would the Tor Project describe its interest in providing compensation
for those "volunteering" for its certain larger needs / desires?
Are securing something like "volunteer coordinator", "wikiweb maintainer",
"ticket triage" "feature implementor" "local talk giver" and so on benefit
from a little grease?
Whether mini contract $100-1k-5k, yearly subsistance $10-15k, so on?
Is that a slippery slope?

As in jobs requiring some changes to website etc?
Work could be done and passed along to the right people for approval. Depends on the types of jobs.

As far as Facebook is concerned I believe the mobile site

without Javascript enabled.

As far as bookmarks are concerned, no I don't believe they can put you
at any further risk assuming there isn't a personally identifiable
session in the URL. Also be aware that bookmarks can contain
