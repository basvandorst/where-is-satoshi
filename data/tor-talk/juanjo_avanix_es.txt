@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor (and other nets) probably screwed by Traffic 
Something like this is what I feared when days ago I sent a message to
this list... If you allow Tor Browser to have all hops from the same
country, or the Tor network relies only on a few countries to host their
nodes (Germany, US, France) then Tor will be useless soon...

@_subject: [tor-talk] Some thoughts about Tor Project 
Hello, I'm just a normal tech guy but I wanted to thank you all Tor
developers and contributors for your work. I know a project like Tor is
needed and it seems it will needed even more in the future. I know it
could be complicated when mass media and the people from the street just
say Tor is a nest for drugs, crimes and pedos but ignores all the good
it does to the world. So I just want to thank you for all your hard work
and sorry for my english if its bad sometimes...
After investigating how Tor works and how mass surveillance is spreading
I made a list of things that could be better:
-A circuit should never have all hops from the same country: days ago I
was on a web with the latest version of Tor Browser and I advised all
hops from the circuit were from the same country. This is bad, since
with bulk data collection and traffic analysis this country could
deanonymize me easily.
-Too much nodes in the same countries... yes, Tor network is controlled
by Germany, USA or France, as I said before if this three countries
implement bulk data collection and share it, maybe more than 50% of the
circuits and Tor users will be deanonymized... I know people just want
cheap VPS to install Tor nodes, but I think thats bad. We should advice
Tor node operators to move their nodes to other countries if possible...
or even a campaign with crowdfunding to create more nodes in countries
where there aren't many...
-Maybe we should think a way of introducing high latency features on
Tor, I know this is troublesome but we need to think a way to protect
people even if NSA and Europe works together against Tor users...
-What about Tor traffic obfuscation by default? I mean the traffic
between all Tor nodes. Will it help on something?
-What about using two circuits like I2P? It would be possible?
-More public libraries with Tor nodes. Great work with that, this
initiative should spread. And maybe how Tor Browser users can help the
network in the future being a relay...
-I heard making a pluggable transport work in a privileged port (less
than 1024) is a hard work. we have to fix it.
-Better node testing: I think some people is working on this already. I
mean more and better ways to test if a exit node is a bad exit, or if
any other node is making traffic shaping attack.
So this is it. Thank you all again for all your hard work and see you in
other time.

Well, Tor Browser by default chooses randomly the nodes which will be part of a circuit, so most of them actually are not from the same country. I don't understand your point here... there could be cases and users where crossing borders might be illegal or more dangerous, but I think most of the people who use Tor Browser by default, doesnt choose all hops from the same country... I think what most of the people needs to protect their anonymity is to choose nodes from different countries, or at least not all from the same country like happened to me.
Maybe we can work here on the Tor Browser config dialog and put there an option like "forbid to choose all hops from the same country" or even say "all hops from different countries".
As I said, maybe for some people crossing borders might not be a good strategy, but right now for most people I think it makes sense. But the problem is still the servers are in too few countries, and I think this is bad for all users... Just think that many european countries are starting to make laws against privacy and even considering bulk data analysis so if USA do this, Germany too and France too, like I said, most of the Tor users will be deanonymized... I will look into that exit funding code too, but I don't have much free time...
I think that should be a priority right now: this works against censorship and even could work against traffic analisys... I can't help developing anything here, but maybe if I have time, I can work on the Yes, I will work spreading the word about privacy, why it is important, the Tor Project, etc...

@_subject: [tor-talk] About Hardened Tor Browser roadmap 
Just two questions: where is the roadmap for Hardened Tor Browser? where can we expect the first stable version or even become the default version of Tor Browser?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser, always same Entry node 
I think thats expected on new versions of Tor, if there are bad Guards spying on people, getting stuck on the same relay minimizes the propability of being spied, otherwise you are changing Guards many often and you can get a bad Guard sooner...
Other thing is when Tor browser select all nodes from the same country... thats really bad because some countries have bulk data interception and correlation, so users with this circuits get deanonymized.
I suggest putting a new option on Tor menu settings: "Never allow all nodes to be from the same country".

@_subject: [tor-talk] Running a relay for some months 
Hi, I have been running a relay (not exit) for some months and I want to
ask why it remain without being a Guard relay. It has been a fast relay,
and stable for some months now. Also, how can my relay become a HSDir ?

Reading further it seems its all about the all known traffic correlation
attacks... nothing new. I already sent months ago here some short
proposals of "what we should do" to prevent these attacks. Now its all
up to Tor developers to do it or not, I actually don't have time right
now to work on Tor itself. (Alternatives like I2P seems safer).
What we should be concerned right now is the 0day bounty program by
Zerodium. I know for sure someone will discover a 0day that works
without Javascript enabled and then governments could use it anywhere.
Of course, I hope its only on the bad Tor like CP or drugs, but, we
cannot be sure they will only employ it there or to hack some
whistleblower or human rights fighter, and that's why we have to condemn
these attacks. Mass hacking always hack innocent people.

@_subject: [tor-talk] arm64 support 
Hello, there is a plan to support binary arm64 on the official Tor
Debian PPA? It would be nice. I'm currently running a Tor Relay on a
arm64 server with Ubuntu and there is a Tor port on the Ubuntu
repositories, but it is outdated. It would be good to support arm64 on
your official Tor PPA.
