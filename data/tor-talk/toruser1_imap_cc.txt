I would be interested.
But how anonymous are bitcoins? With traditional money, only the
government gets to watch you spend it. With BitCoin, now the entire
community gets to watch!

Some of you may be aware of the paper,"Cyber Crime Scene Investigations
(C2SI) through Cloud Computing"
( which illustrates
a feasible method of invalidating the anonymity afforded by Tor.
For those who are not, the approach is this: Someone with a lot of
money, such as a government, uses cloud computing to release a veritable
army of Tor relays into the Tor network. The number of legitimate Tor
relay nodes in the network is dwarfed by those under the government's
control. The chances of your Tor client choosing a government-controlled
("evil") Tor node when building a circuit increase to 99/100. Since one
entity (the government) controls the evil relay nodes, and 2 or 3 of the
three relay nodes in your circuit are evil; chances are you have no
anonymity left to speak of.
Does anyone have any comments on this paper? Any reassurance? Frankly,
this is scary.
I nominate this paper as a founding reason why Tor should permit users
to increase the number of relay nodes used in each circuit above the
current value of 3...

The nature of the attack outlined in the paper is expensive. The paper
suggests rapid deployment, collection of data, and undeployment. The
longer the interloping system runs, the more it costs.
Perhaps, at a network level, we can detect a sudden massive deployment
of ORs and mark them as suspicious?
Or, as mentioned earlier, we can assign an OR a level of trust
commensurate with its age? (Admittedly, this may increase security at
the expense of delayed benefit of new ORs)
Either of these tactics may help to make such an attack more expensive
and/or less effective. Seems better than doing nothing.

I agree with you here, but on different grounds:
Would this increase anonymity? As pointed out previously, not much.
Attacks against Tor anonymity usually relate to entry-point/exit-point
traffic correlation... Regardless of how many segments are in the
middle, if your adversary can "corner the market" on exit nodes, it
doesn't matter how many intermediate relay nodes you're using. (Correct
me where I'm wrong, experts)
Would this increase the health of the overall network? Yes*! And for
that reason, I'm all for it. Let's make Tor clients treat the "run as
relay" feature as an "opt-out" instead of an "opt-in" process. As you
pointed out, Bit Torrent showed that users are willing to pay to play.

* I believe I read that relays on Windows XP are particularly buggy...
Also, symmetry of up/down bandwidth can be an issue too... which is

...It's been a while since I was in high school. I just assumed it was a
recent addition to the vernacular. :)

@_subject: Active Attacks - Already in Progress? 
We recently discussed an attack on onion-routing anonymity, wherein a
well-funded adversary overwhelms the network with compromised relays,
thereby increasing his chances of monitoring anonymity-compromising
I don't mean to alarm anyone, but I just did some quick-and-dirty
research that suggests such an attempt may already be under way. I hope
to be proven wrong.
I postulated that such an attacker would mass-deploy his relays in a way
that did not lend a whole lot of uniqueness to the name of each relay*.
The relay names would probably be random characters, numbers, or words
at best. At sloppiest, they would just be one name with sequential
numbers after it - "AnonymityAttacker001, AnonymityAttacker002,
AnonymityAttacker003, etc."
So, I decided to look for such patterns in the list of Relays available
in my Tor console. A quick scan revealed what appeared to be either (A)
mass-deployments of Tor relays by a singular entity, or (B)
astronomically-unlikely coincidental naming schemes adopted by dozens of
disparate and unconnected individuals.**
But it wasn't just finding these relays that concerned me. It was Tor's
affinity for routing through them.
See, I began closing my open circuits systematically. I kept records of
any circuits which contained PPrivCom___ or torserversNet_ relays in it.
I closed and recorded 43 circuits. Here are my findings:
While Tor indicated it had 1665 relays to choose from, 79% of my
circuits used one of the suspicious relays. 2% of my circuits used two
suspicious relays. 0% of my circuits used three suspicious relays.
Of the circuits I recorded, only 21% did not route through a suspicious
My conclusion is that someone (a security researcher? A hobbyist? A
government?) is actively toying with the feasibility of attacking Tor's
anonymity. According to my statistics, they may also be gaming Tor's
affinity for choosing relays*** because they have, unquestionably,
succeeded in relaying 79% of my circuits despite controlling a mere 2.8%
of the relays in the Tor network.
How dangerous is it if two of the three circuit relays are compromised?
What recourse do we have? Can someone more knowledgeable shed more light
on this? I yield the balance of my time. :)
* Of course, the well-organized attacker would go to the trouble to
construct names that truly blended in with the Tor namescape - such
as,"MrSpudRelays, QueenAnnesRevenge, SteveKenpIsMyHero, and so forth."
** I speak primarily of "torserversNet_" numbers 1-5, and PPrivCom___"
numbers 004-052.
*** The inner workings of which I, admittedly, do not understand...
**** 47 out of 1665 active relays, according to my Tor console.

I don't take issue with these particular nodes, nor the method in which
they are multiplied.
What concerns me is that any single entity (person/organization) is
capable of convincing my Tor client to use it in the majority of
circuits I build. The clusters I pointed out before have been vouched
for by the community, and that's fine, let's assume they're not evil.
But the fact remains that nobody - good or evil - should be capable of
making themselves a party in my circuit with such reliability.

In my research (posted earlier to this list), I did not find an issue
with exit relays. The relays which were reliably chosen as part of my
circuit were often the first or second relay in my circuit - not the
exit relay.
I'm running a relay of my own, no worries.

I'd like to second Bernd's question (see his OP, I won't quote it all
here). This is a hazy area in my understanding of Tor, yet a clear
understanding is important. Someone, kindly answer?
