@_subject: [tor-talk] tor 0.2.8.5-rc connecting to 18.0.0.1 
I have just subscribed, i have been using tor for a long time. thank you guys for your commitment to privacy in developing this tool.
I'd like to ask why is tor-win32-0.2.8.5-rc.zip and torbrowser-install-6.5a2_en-US.exe connecting to 18.0.0.1 ?
every time i use either TBB or tor alone my fw alerts/logs the connection to this ip.
tested on separate machines with windows 7 and also xp.
i have downloaded both from i have checked signatures and sha256 unsigned builds for both of them and everything checks (sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt)
for tor-win32-0.2.8.5-rc.zip           3b311c8819946d177b96ae89e3c4f4fa3da59e0b588defdf21c6d82a21fd536c (after stripping the signature)
for torbrowser-install-6.5a2_en-US.exe     d5daab5cfb7b3e856235f5993aff08a91e4dbb68cff5a9a990ccbc1da3513ebf (after stripping the signature)
is tor 0.2.8.5-rc binding a socket to 18.0.0.1 ? or is it something else?  if so why is this not on the changelog?
this was a bug 4 or 5 years ago for mac users, had a ticket and its been solved.
 as a result of this newly tor behavior i decided to stop using both packages because for "a simple or common user" like me there is no way to tell why tor is now using 18.0.0.1 to connect or bind.
the simple notion that tor connects to an ip with 18.0.0.1 seems unsettling specially when a old ticket solved the issue
although it was for mac users, i have never encounter this behavior before when using previous versions of TBB or tor packages in windows.
the other recent version "torbrowser-install-6.0.3_en-US.exe" (e8ca44a4d73bc0183973e3e7abbbaf546c2a1d2cae3df58b76e929332e02a277) simply
connects to 127.0.0.1 no other behavior is shown.
can someone please clarify
thank you.

after setting Log info or log debug stdout.. i didnt get any info for the adapters. tor connects to the network and only
references 127.0.0.1 with "Notice"
"[Notice] Opening Socks listener on 127.0.0.1:xxxx"
"DisableIOCP 0/1" wont push away tor connecting to 18... either but i tried just in case to see if the behavior from
IOCP networking API would affect the connection.
yes blocking the ip does the trick for the fw while tor connects to the network.
thank you for the explanation.
