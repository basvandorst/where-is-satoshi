Could be a bug in Tormap, but it could also mean that Tormap cannot find any
geodata to your node's ip. If you tell me the name of the node I can check
wether it is a bug or not.

But they use the "maxmind" database, which seems to be more complete than the
data available on "hostip".
Have you tried it again? Does it work now?

That is possible because Tormap does some caching and assumes that the IP
address will stay the same for at least a month. Every month or so the cache
gets renewed.
Maybe the monthly intervall needs some finetuning ;-).

I just skimmed through the or-talk archives and found a thread about a map of
the TOR network. As the mentioned project seems no longer to exist I want to
point you to
 where you can find such a map (via google or via clean jpeg).
Please comment and suggest features.
