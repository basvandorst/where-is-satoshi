Or build your own. :-)

@_subject: No torrc in xBBrowser 
A couple of years ago, I was looking for how to use the torrc instead of the .ini file in order to bypass a firewall/proxy. The only answers I could find were something along the lines of "we can't tell you how to evade..." and "that's not why Tor was created." I even looked at the NSIS code using Notepad++ and saw where it was passing the arguments, but also realized that only a small part of it (the launcher) was open source. I got tired of messing with it and having it hang for a minute every time I tested it. I found things that worked much better for me.
Anyway, how do you get it to use the torrc if we need to implement things from the Tor man page (rather than the Xerobank configuration file), and where should it be located for the Xerobank implementation to work? Also, telling us how to do all those lock-downs would be great for verifying if they work. Are they very different from the ones in TorButton? The Firefox in the Tor Browser Bundle is not "just out of the box."

 - Same, same, but different?
I would recommend you that you ask your question over at XeroBank's Forum (forum.xerobank.com).
You could build your own, however, unless you are good at securing Mozilla products, you might want to continue using xBBrowser.
Straight out of the box, Firefox is not safe to use with Tor.  It is susceptible to many side-channel attacks that could leak your real IP address.
The docs at (  )  do not have any mention about the security involved in building your own.
As a matter of fact, I don't see any documentation on how to build your own Browser Bundle...hrm.
I only see instruction on how to use a web browser (Firefox) and a chat client (Pidgin).
If you don't know how to use a web browser, then you might want to check out (  ) and take some time to read up on it.  However, since you've already used xB Browser, then I'm sure you already know how to use a web browser.  ;-)
If you're feeling adventurous, go ahead and build your own.
Otherwise, stick to free products that have been doing this awhile and have spent time (and money) on making sure it is secure from side-channel attacks.
Again, I would recommend you that you ask your question over at XeroBank's Forum (forum.xerobank.com).
Most people around here, if not all of them, don't appreciate xerobank.  So do not expect to find answers for your xerobank questions here.

@_subject: tor provided me first warning of corrupted ISP name servers 
Is there a site that acts as a repository for instances of net blockage. In many cases, Internet censorship is transparent to to user. If we can get the word out as to exactly what is being blocked where, then perhaps we can also get the word out about how to get around these kinds of blocks (Tor). That could dramatically increase the user base, thereby strengthening the anonymity of the network.

I was wondering if this is the same issue as discussed in this message:
Exceeding connection limit
Windows imposes a default limit of 10 concurrent TCP connect attempts. Is that the same as "a system-imposed limit on the number of open file descriptors - one file descriptor corresponds to one open file or socket" described in the above referenced message?
If it is, what would be good settings for users? That message suggested 4096 for nodes. I am wondering if raising the limit could make startup faster (mine takes forever if I haven't been on the network in a while).
Much of the "expert advice" on the web about the concurrent TCP connect attempts (the issue of Windows event 4226 when that limit is exceeded) is bittorrent-oriented, and often warns that the number should not be "too high." They usually recommend a limit between 50 and 100. It's probably nonsense, so I would like to know how this should be set for Tor.

Industry organization putting pressure on Tor exit node operators to filter leads to chilling effects.
As nodes start to filter, that traffic will seek out non-filtering exits. That would work like a funnel, as a majority of traffic of that sort will exit through a decreasing number of exits, thereby making those non-filtering nodes appear to be large-scale violators.
Has it occured to any of you that these organizations are being conspiciously aggressive with certain people with the complete knowledge that they are Tor exit node operators and what their exit policies are? They want complete network filtering, and that includes the Tor network.

Notice the A in asterisks. This makes me think that the attack may have
been done on a private Tor network (rather than the main, public one).
If that's true, it's a far cry from carrying it out on the real Tor

Tor was originally created for the United States government. Why would you assume that people from the government or private companies would never route POP3 traffic through Tor? How is this assumption related at all to the issue of authorized service use?
As for your method, if a mail host wants to prohibit Tor they can simply run Tor and ban the IP addresses of all the exit nodes in the network. They could also monitor accounts accessed via that list for signs of what they consider to be abuse. Your way is for a mail host to visit your blog, then compare your blog entries to their accounts to see if there is a match. Doing this would give them a tiny fraction of potential Tor users because you only operate one exit node out of many. It is less efficient by far.
It also alerts outsiders to certain email accounts that are being accessed through Tor. If an outsider can link an email account to a specific person, then that individual could be subject to bad consequences as a result.

The first release candidate for the next stable series of the
security-enhanced Torbutton Firefox extension has been released. This
release features functional support for Firefox 3. However, this
support has not been extensively tested. In particular, timezone
masking does not work at all. The workaround is to manually set the
environment variable 'TZ' to 'UTC' before starting Firefox. This works
on both Linux and Windows.
Firefox 3 users should keep a close eye on Torbutton. In particular,
the new Places history database code is connected to all sorts of
different parts of the browser, and it is unknown if 'disabling
history' actually prevents disk writes for many parts of its database.
It is also possible this code may perform strange network accesses at
odd times as well (the 'Livemarks' code is one case of this that has
known issues). Please keep an eye on your Vidalia window. Adventurous
users can also run wireshark, and/or help with the disk access
auditing by running Process Monitor on their Windows systems:
A list of other Firefox bugs known to impact Torbutton security can be
found at: Here is the complete changelog for 1.2.0rc1:
 * general: FF3 should now be functional, but timezone masking is not
   operational
 * bugfix: Fix Places/history component hooking in FF3
 * bugfix: Disable Places database in FF3 via browser.history_expire_days=0
   if history writes are disabled.
 * bugfix: General component hooking fixes for FF3
 * bugfix: Block favicon leaking in FF3
 * bugfix: Enable safebrowsing updates in FF3 (it's finally HMACd. Yay).
 * bugfix: Use Greg Fleischer's new useragent prefs in FF3.
 * bugfix: Properly reset cookie lifetime policy when user changes
   cookie handling options.
 * bugfix: Fix 'Restore defaults' button issues with custom proxy settings
 * bugfix: navigator.oscpu hooking was broken in 1.1.18
 * bugfix: Try to prevent alleged 0x0 windows on crash recovery
 * bugfix: Attempt to block livemarks updates during Tor. Only
   partial fix. Not possible to cancel existing Livemarks timer (one fetch    will still happen via Tor before disable). See Firefox Bug 436250

The Tor state (enabled/disabled) is the state it was in when Firefox was previously closed. It should be that the user may select the starting state as a main option. TorButton's current behavior could be the default behavior with a selector for Default, Enabled and Disabled options.
I have started Firefox and accidentally queried .onion addresses while Tor was disabled on startup. Rather than having everyone try to be more careful or to make sure to set the desired start state before exiting Firefox, there should be a selectable starting state.
Some people do not want Tor to be enabled on browser startup, some (such as myself) want it to be, and some may prefer it's current behavior. I think it is very important and should be a main option.

Karsten N. just sent to the German exitnodes list a link to an article, which is very convincing and legally well-founded (see below). It explains that any service that is being donated to the public, that is, without taking money or any other return service (like advertisements) for it, is _not_ obliged to retain any connection data! Furthermore, since there is no gray area, who isn't obliged to retain data is not _allowed_ to retain data, and can be charged with a fee up to 10.000 EUR for doing so! Since Tor is without doubts such a donated service, this turns the tables, and it is clearly a risk for a Tor operator in Germany to retain any data. (You would have to proof that you're financing your Tor node by a return service of the users and therefore are obliged to retain connection data. ;-) )

Are you saying that a solution to prevent websites from tracking their visitors is to have a third party block to have a content-based filter in case some of the blocked websites also happen to have IP tracking enabled (or are under some form of surveillance)? Is this really what you mean? How does this solution help when the traffic is coming from a Tor exit node and is reasonably well anonymized?
What do you think national authorities would say about someone in their country openly providing access to Internet content that they have blocked? Why would someone want to block content that has not already been blocked by the authorities?
Can you share with us in what way Turkish DNS servers are corrupted? If you think that would be off-topic here, feel free to email me directly, as I would be personally very interested in specific examples of Turkish content filtering.
Does OpenDNS allow blocking on a per-domain basis? All I could get from their website was their list of content categories from which an operator could choose. May I ask, which domains and content categories were you interested in blocking? Also, why impose the same blocking that you would use for your own LAN-access upon any Tor user that happens upon your exit node? Would it not be better to have any blocking in your exit policy so that users interested in content that you have blocked may instead route around you rather than see your personal message to them?

Microsoft working to eliminate Internet anonymity
By Jabulani Leffall
Aug 19, 2009
Microsoft researchers have unveiled an anti-hacking concept that can help
track hackers or malicious content to origin servers.
The Host Tracker program's goal is to "de-anonymize the Internet" through
the ability to host servers with 99 percent accuracy.
Host Tracker is designed to unmask would-be hackers who take
advantage of anonymizing techniques by cross-referencing Internet
protocol traffic data to identify the true origin. Microsoft's
representatives said the Host Tracker system relies on
application-level events -- in this case, Internet Explorer browser
sessions -- to automatically infer host-IP bindings.
Researchers Yinglian Xie, Fang Yu and Martin Abadi ran
some initial tests by analyzing a month's worth of data from an e-mail
server, roughly 330 GB, to ascertain from the samples who may have been
responsible for sending out certain types of spam. They studied some
550 million user IDs and 220 million IP addresses, and matched time
stamps for message transmission or e-mail log-ons.
"The fact that we are able to trace malicious traffic to the proxy
itself is an improvement because we are able to pinpoint the exact
origin," Xie said (a PDF of the study can be found at
 ).

US CODE: Title 18,2703. Required disclosure of customer communications or records
(f)  Requirement To Preserve Evidence.?
(1) In general.? A provider of wire or electronic communication services or a remote computing service, upon the request of a governmental entity, shall take all necessary steps to preserve records and other evidence in its possession pending the issuance of a court order or other process.
(2) Period of retention.? Records referred to in paragraph (1) shall be retained for a period of 90 days, which shall be extended for an additional 90-day period upon a renewed request by the governmental entity.
How transparent are these government requests? How do we know the scale, scope and specificity of them? If we ask, will they tell us what is being retained? If it is routine to retain records for a short amount of time, what would prevent the government from making sweeping requests that they could then sort out in the future?
Here is a two minute video made by the ACLU of Northern California about what they claim in going on right now. According to them, the government is purchasing a lot of user information from brokers:

I am visiting a secure Website ( https:// ) with your service, and the Fingerprint is wrong!
If you are accessing a webpage through this service, connection is done between the server of the webpage you want to visit, and this server. Thats why the secured connection is established between this two servers, and not between you and the server of the webpage. Anyhow the content will not be readable when it is transferred to you, because the connection between you and this service is also secured. But it uses a different key than the website you like to visit. Thats why the fingerprints differ.
But be aware, that we theoretical could spy on the content if we want to. Of course we will never do so! But you should know that it is possible, and that is why you should not transfer high sensitive data over this service (for example credit card or online-banking PIN and TAN).

Instead of using a protocol to tell Torbutton to ensure routing through Tor, have you considered using the .onion TLD for that purpose?

Is it plausible that a group of people could be NATed together with a node operator? How does limiting node data eliminate the problem of an IP address match? Isn't this more a problem of historical data being publicly available ad-hoc? Where is it kept? Is there a need or good use for it? (Yes, of course would-be attackers could maintain their own lists.)
If one doesn't want to use Tor to visit example.com, maybe a non-blocked one-hop proxy would work. I don't know how to solve the bigger problem of IP address linking without using a remote proxy.

So a site that was able to link users to a pool or residential dynamic IP addresses through Tor metrics still would not be certain that multiple accounts belong to the same individual.
I don't mean that. I mean that your feature request blots out details about the node, but not the IP address. How will preventing your adversary from knowing things like name, Tor version, exit policy and bandwidth help?
Can you think of any changes that would make it safer without sacrificing anything useful?
I was not proposing that as an anonymity solution. I still don't understand why using Tor would not be a solution, but in cases where it's not (such as when exits are blocked by the site you need), I don't see much alternative other than using free Wi-Fi, an Internet cafe or a friend's house.

You don't need to run a node for your ISP to know that you are a Tor user. Even downloading Tor is enough to make a person suspect in some places.
I witnessed an incident on the  IRC channel in which a user that had decided to operate a relay was looking for guidance on what kind of relay. Several people warned against it because of privacy the "privacy risks" involved. (This wasn't very long ago; maybe there is a log.) I got the feeling that the person then seriously reconsidered even bothering.
I don't think that running a Tor node is considered a subversive activity in Democratic nations. I encourage anybody who can run a node to do so if they have resources to spare.

@_subject: [tor-talk] de-anonymization by correlating circuit changes 
Even if someone knows with certainty the middle relay associated with specific exit traffic, the user's location is still unknown. Even the entry node is unknown to that someone.
If someone already knows the location of a user and the website that the user wants to visit, and can monitor both, then Tor won't (and wasn't made to) stop that someone from possibly confirming the connections based on when they happen.

What I think you are assuming is that your attacker can monitor and log all Internet traffic in one nation and the user lives in that nation and uses Tor exclusively from that nation. That sounds reasonable.
Are you also assuming that the exit node is in that nation? Tor avoids making circuits in which the entry and exit nodes are in the same country, and one can prevent Tor from choosing exit nodes in a particular country. If the attacker can monitor many Tor exit nodes throughout the world, then it is a global adversary -- Tor won't be enough. The user would be vulnerable to a traffic confirmation attack based on timing the network traffic.
If the attacker can monitor every relay in a user's circuit, then they could trace the stream. Otherwise, the encryption layers between the user and each relay prevent relays (or eavesdroppers) from being able to link users to their destinations.

I just looked into it, and I was wrong. Tor prevents circuits with the entry and exit both being from the same /16 subnet. That's the first half of the IP address. It doesn't stop them from being in the same country by default. See  for recent discussion on this topic.
Also, it's not just about which nodes you select. There can be all sorts of intermediate hops between Tor nodes, and the destination and the user could already be under surveillance. Paul Syverson (the inventor of onion routing) went over a few of those situations in his response to your question.

To get your current setup working, in Firefox go to Tools > Options > Advanced > Network > Settings. Select "Manual proxy configuration." Set your HTTP proxy and SSL proxy to 127.0.0.1 Port 8118. Set your SOCKS host to 127.0.0.1 Port 9050. Make sure that SOCKS v5 is selected.

@_subject: IP address blocked on certain site 
You seem to have the misconception that Tor only uses one circuit at any given time, and that you can determine what IP address a server will think you are coming from by checking with a website. You can easily choose the same exits node after restarting Firefox, and I believe even after creating a new set of circuits with the Use a New Identity button in Vidalia.
Tor builds several circuits that you can use at any given time. I think three is default... You can try to "check your IP address" with a website, but you can choose a different circuit to check than the one you actually choose to hit your desired website. The IP address check would show the IP address of the exit node for one circuit, while it's possible that you could be hitting the website you want to use through the same exit node (of a different circuit) again and again.
If you are running Vidalia, click the "View the Network button. You should see a list of the circuits Tor has built. Keep that window open while you surf, and you can see which circuits Tor is using.
To force Tor to use a particular exit node of your choosing, first add 'AllowDotExit 1' to your torrc. Then you will be able to make requests using the .exit notation below:
SYNTAX:  [hostname].[name-or-digest].exit
           [name-or-digest].exit

@_subject: Is "gatereloaded" a Bad Exit? 
Is it possible that some people operate in a port-restricted environment or that port 443 is throttled by some ISPs?
My real question concerns the scenario in which a user happens upon an exit that blocks HTTPS and uses that exit to access a website that uses a combination of HTTP and HTTPS. The HTTPS portion would be forced through a different exit, and the server may be programmed to notice the difference and break by design.
For example, say you want to login somewhere, and the server notes that you appear to be logging in from France. The HTTPS portion appears to come from the United States. That disparity triggers an "I'm sorry..." message.

@_subject: [tor-talk] bridges inquiry 
Please don't use Tor -- and especially not bridges -- for mass-downloading. Bridges are special, secret relays that serve people in places that automatically block Tor relays. If you are downloading so many things that you need software to manage the process, then you may be blocking someone from doing something important. Remember, some people only know a few bridge addresses. If those bridges are being used for hours on end, it could be hard for them even to connect. A download manager schedules downloads so that you can do things like eat and sleep while your files slowly come, and automatically starts new downloads immediately after previous ones have finished.
That said, I don't think a bridge can speed up your circuit. By using a bridge, you are using one additional Tor relay (and all the hops from you to it, and from it to the entry relay), thereby increasing latency. There is also a chance that the bridge would have the lowest throughput of all the relays in the circuit, thereby constraining data rate.
I think that something happened to your circuit, and using a bridge just gave you a new circuit. Circuits are random.

The first line tells Tor to prefer exit relays in the United States. The second line tells Tor to strictly enforce that preference.
Then stop Tor and start it again. To go back to normal usage, remove those two lines from your torrc and stop, then start Tor again.
A quick way to do it is to type  into your browser's address bar when  is the fingerprint of a Tor exit relay in the United States. Another way is to visit a web proxy server set up to get around self-censorship and use that to access the website you want.

Try clicking "Use a New Identity" in Vidalia and see if that behavior persists. It may just be that Tor is using that exit because you've already built the circuit and it's still available. It may also be that you chose a high-capacity exit which Tor has a decent chance of randomly selecting for other circuits.

The spike this September dwarfs the early August spike at over 1 million bridge users. Maybe that means college is in session, but I've got a bad feeling it's something else. Maybe it's the natural escalation of the cat and mouse game by someone that really hates the idea of bridge nodes.
The CSV file works in MS Excel. There was no data from July 31 to August 4. The measurements taken on July 30 and August 5 were extremely low, so that leads me to think that data collection stopped early on July 30 and restarted late on August 5. The total number was also very low on August 6, so maybe data collection on that day was intermittent. It's strange that the first big spike began (or at least appeared to begin) on August 7, breaking 100,000 bridge users for the first time, and increasing to nearly half a million each of the following two days.
I noticed something else interesting. If you check the totals for July 29, the number of bridge users breaks 80,000 for the first time. I think if it weren't for the 7 to 8 day hole in the data, we would see a smoother spike instead of the sharp one.
