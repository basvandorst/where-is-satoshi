Hi all.
I'm running a Tor server (WinXP SP2) with an exit node on port 80
(hidden service) and my Tor message log is displaying a streaming list
of 'yellow' warnings (please see below). I disabled the XP personal
firewall that ships with the product and open ports TCP/UDP
incoming/outgoing) 8118, 9001, and 9050 on the McAfee personal firewall
as well in an attempt to create a stable Tor server. Any help would be
appreciated. Thanks, Caitlin

@_subject: Setting up hidden services on Tor server. 
Hi all.
Ok. I am running a Tor server with an exit node on port 80 and a hidden
service (web server). I'd like to add  few more (i.e. SSH server and
IRC). Can anyone help with the details? I installed an OpenSSL binary
last week.
WinXP (SP2)
Vidalia 0.0.7
Tor 0.1.1.23
Qt 4.1.0

@_subject: Tor server question regarding hidden services. 
I just finished enabling a hidden service on my Tor server but I felt
compelled to ask a few questions.
1). In order to run a hidden service, does one have to set-up a Tor
server with an exit node? If so, would I have to use the rule:
accept * 80

I seem to be seeing a large number of:

for 15 seconds to connect to '[scrubbed]' using exit 'nycbug'. Retrying
on a new circuit.
in the Tor log. This adversely affects the performance of my client. Is
this a problem I can fix?
Also, the following message:
Sep 08 00:51:31:343 [Warning] second_elapsed_callback(): Your server
(xx.xxx.xxx.xxx:9001) has not managed to confirm that its ORPort is
reachable. Please check your firewalls, ports, address, /etc/hosts
file, etc.
concerns me slightly. Any help? Thanks,
Caitlin (A Tor newbie).

Hi all.
My Tor server set-up:
WinXP (SP2)
Tor 0.1.1.23
Privoxy 3.0.3
Earthlink ADSL
I seem to be seeing an *excessive* number of log entries of the form:
Sep 14 16:03:27:562 [Notice] connection_ap_expire_beginning(): We tried
for 15 seconds to connect to '[scrubbed]' using exit 'cbadhjkssdhjbc'.
Retrying on a new circuit.  in addition to:
Sep 14 16:10:47:375 [Warning] second_elapsed_callback(): Your server
(68.166.243.253:9001) has not managed to confirm that its ORPort is
reachable. Please check your firewalls, ports, address, /etc/hosts
file, etc.
Any ideas? I configured the Tor Server to have an exit node (port 80),
server port 9001, update IP automatically, Bandwidth Limit Rates:
(2048-6048), Accept * 80. I'm currently running the 'personal firewall'
that ships with XP as well as 'McAfee Personal Firewall Plus'. Do I
need to explicitly open port 9001(?) If so, can someone provide a brief
'run through'? Thanks, "Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind." - Dr. Seuss, "Oh the Places You'll Go"

Yes, you're right but I forgot to mention that the software eventually
gives up on another path (essentially it seems to stall) and I cannot
log-out of Yahoo mail. Another annoying event is that I see a blank
page after submitting login information. "Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind." - Dr. Seuss, "Oh the Places You'll Go"

Hi all.
I upgraded to Tor 0.1.1.26 semi-recently and I noticed that when I
attempted to configure a server, the settings were not being saved
(i.e. it was as if I never entered any data).
Any help would be appreciated,

@_subject: Problem starting Tor. 
Hi Roger.
Ok. I never installed the 0.1.2.8-beta but this is what occured when I
attempted to install the most recent release candidate:
WinXP (SP2)
Vidalia bundle 0.1.2.9RC
I downloaded and installed the bundle. In the process, the installer
notified me that I already had a torrc config file and would I like to
overwrite it? Yes. After it finished, I confirmed I would like to 'run
installed components now'. Within 10 seconds, a dark onion appeared in
my system tray with a red 'X' through it and a pop-up box appeared that
said: 'Vidalia was unable to start Tor. Check your settings to ensure
the correct name and location of your Tor executable is specified.'
I right-clicked on the onion (in the system tray) and clicked on
'settings'. The path to my tor executable is: 'C:\Program
Files\Tor\tor.exe' (no quotes). I confirmed that tor.exe is at that
location. After clicking the 'Save' button, I attempted to re-start tor
but with the same result. Re-booting the machine was also ineffective
stategy. Other steps taken? Peforming a complete search of my hard
drive (including subfolders and hidden files) for a 2nd tor.exe file
was unsuccessful. Hope this helps,

Hi Roger.
OK. I fixed the problem. I unchecked 'Run tor in the background as a
windows service' after running tor by double clicking on the exe file
(the tor messages were displayed in a command prompt window). I closed
that window and unchecked the service box before looking at the message

In my previous attempt to resolve the dilemma, I did check to see if
tor was running as a service. It was not but all I could do was
(unsuccessfully) start one.

I'm attempting to start Tor (the latest release candidate as of
