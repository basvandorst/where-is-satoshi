I was shocked that almost nobody donates money to Werner Koch. Especially
in the Post-Snowden Era.
Are we so greedy/stupid/so f*cken selfish that we can not donate some money
to a man, whose labor we use to protect our most sensitive information?!
Hell, we buy bread, coffee and cheese and pay at the cash register, but for
privacy we are unable (or rather do not want to) to pay a penny.
And then we wonder, why is that great security software vanish or don't
receive security updates fast enough. And whom do we blame? The NSA, the
GCHQ. But it's not only them. This is us. This is our indifference, dammit!
Each throws off the responsibility on the other. "Someone else will
donate". Or "I have donated a year ago" (wow! And this year the developer
doesn't want to eat, right?!)
Our enemies are investing billions into breaking down these
programs/protocols which are designed to protect us (GPG, Tor, OTR, Tails,
VeraCrypt, Jitsi etc.). And? It turns out, that the developers of these
great programs don't have enough money even for the bare minimum!
It is a shame!
I encourage everyone, right here and now, to donate some money to his three

@_subject: [tor-talk] A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace 
by John Perry Barlow
Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I
come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask
you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have
no sovereignty where we gather.
We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address
you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always
speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally
independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral
right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true
reason to fear.
Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You
have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not
know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your
borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public
construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows
itself through our collective actions.
You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you
create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our
ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order
than could be obtained by any of your impositions.
You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this
claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't
exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will
identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social
Contract . This governance will arise according to the conditions of our
world, not yours. Our world is different.
Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself,
arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a
world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.
We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice
accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.
We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her
beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence
or conformity.
Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and
context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no
matter here.
Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by
physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest,
and the commonweal, our governance will emerge . Our identities may be
distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our
constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope
we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we
cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.
In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications
Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams
of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These
dreams must now be born anew in us.
You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world
where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust
your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly
to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of
humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole,
the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes
from the air upon which wings beat.
In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States,
you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at
the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small
time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in
bit-bearing media.
Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate
themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own
speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be
another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world,
whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed
infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires
your factories to accomplish.
These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same
position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had
to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare
our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to
consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the
Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.
We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more
humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.

Of course, one can play with the restart of Tor, but it kills much time and

it doesn't always bring success.
Besides, it's getting worser. In the last two years i see it on more and

Jacob Appelbaum ? 6th Jun 2016 from TwitLonger
Berlin, June 6, 2016
In the past few days, a calculated and targeted attack has been launched to
spread vicious and spurious allegations against me. Given the way these
accusations have been handled, I had little choice but to resign from my
position as an advocate at the Tor Project and devote my full attention to
completing my doctoral work on cryptography at the Technical University of
Vague rumors and smear campaigns against me are nothing new. As a longtime
public advocate for free speech and a secure internet, there have been
plenty of attempts to undermine my work over the years.
Now, however, these unsubstantiated and unfounded attacks have become so
aggressive that I feel it?s necessary to set the record straight. Not only
have I been the target of a fake website in my name that has falsely
accused me of serious crimes, but I have also received death threats
(including a Twitter handle entitled ?TimeToDieJake?).
I think it?s extremely damaging to the community that these
character-assassination tactics are being deployed, especially given their
ugly history of being used against fellow members of the LGBT community. It
pains me to watch the community to which I?ve dedicated so much of my life
engage in such self-destructive behavior. Nonetheless, I am prepared to use
legal channels, if necessary, to defend my reputation from these libelous
I want to be clear: the accusations of criminal sexual misconduct against
me are entirely false.
Inevitably, there may have been moments in my professional or private life
when I may have inadvertently hurt or offended others? feelings. Whenever I
was aware of these instances, I have, and will continue to, apologize to
the friends and colleagues in question and to continually learn how to be a
better person. Though the damage to my reputation caused by these
allegations alone is impossible to undo, I nonetheless take the concerns of
the Tor community seriously. To dispel any further rumors, to the best of
my knowledge, the Tor network is not ?compromised.?
I?ve dedicated my life as a journalist, activist, and longtime member of
the Tor Project to advocating for the transparency of public processes and
to speaking out about the necessity of privacy, security, and anonymity.
These are ideals that I will continue to uphold, despite the vicious
campaign that is currently being waged against me.

A perfect comment Zenaan.
Very mature, wise and clearly in the bull's*-*eye.
Thank you.
"all"?!! Please!
Classic dichotomy thinking! "It must be saintliness or abject evil."
Can someone be human, make mistakes yet be constructive in this world,
attempt to crack open some mind prisons for individuals here and there,
and sometimes succeed, sometimes not reach own standards? Have personal
things to handle, learn, improve on?
Is a human who does make a mistake entitled to speak to it, or to remain
silent, or to have a space where genuine communication with aggrieved one
can occur?
Did you read "The Weaponising Of Social Part 2: Stomping On IOError’s
Grave"? If not, perhaps go and read it now...
You apply the rules you choose to apply, in your own mind!
Most of us are mostly in self imposed mind prisons, self censoring,
endlessly bound in dichotomies, failing to bring empathy (a common
Westerner failing these days), failing to bring nuance to our
conversation, just leaping on a black or white lynch mob train.
We HAVE to do better.
If you have facts proving the theft, then I agree with you.
If you only have a feeling, or assumption, or "well he's the most likely
one", then YES, that IS a violation of due process, due care to one
another, due consideration of the types of conversations and society/
community we want to live in, to create by our conversations for our
children to live in.
If you can't live the law, the law is not real for you. If it's not worth
living, then it is not true/ natural law.
You are binding yourself/ your conversation to an unnecessarily extreme
legal think.
How do you --want-- to live? Who do you want to be? How would you want
people to think/ consider/ treat you in conversation in such
circumstances, or are we really wasting our time trying to wear another's
The law should only be a backup for when people -fail- to live the law in
their interactions - "the law" that goes beyond this is mostly artificial,
against our interests, against common sense, and destructive of community.
Please, let's try to lift the conversation. Now is the moment. Now is YOUR
opportunity to live a higher ethic (by your own standard, not mine) - live
the highest you are capable of and it WILL make for a better world.
