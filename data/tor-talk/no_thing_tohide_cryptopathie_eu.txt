@ Vladimir: Sorry, but my Russian language skills are a little bit
developable, i. e. I understand not one word of your mail.
I know that actually some Russian folks don't like the UK and the US
and all the western countries (No, we /really/ did not want to shoot
down Mr. Putin over the Ukraina!), but at least the language is very
useful to communicate.
Spasibo i do svidanija!

Sorry, but I guess that something is wrong with this thread. The first
mail came from 'TerryZ at Safe-mail.net' (1) and the further replies
of the surveilled person from 'andrewfriedman101 at gmail.com' (2)(3).
I checked the mail-headers and the hostnames matched the addresses
(rimon.safe-mail.net and mail-la0-x232.google.com). When you search
for the gmail address, you get to a real estate broker in California
(4) and some spam-lists (5)(6).
Perhaps this is one person who changed the mail-address for this list
from Wed to Fri, or that are two persons.
Best regards

Hash: SHA1
Hello Tor!
Running an internal relay in Graz since 7/2013, where William Weber's
appartment was raided in 2012, when some idiot misused his exit for
illegal stuff, I became interested in his case. But I know it only
from the newspapers.
The raid took place on Wed, 2012-11-28 (1). William did intensive
blogging afterwards (2)(3), the legal process started, and ended this
week Mon, 2014-06-30, with 3 y probation. I found a German article
which provides a good summary (4, Google Translate).
He was not convicted for operating an exit (!!), what is legal in
Austria. But, according to the opinion of the judges, for
"contribution to delinquency" ('Beitragstaeterschaft' in German):
"(...) that he answered in an interview to the question whether he was
aware that Tor could be used for distribution of child pornography,
responded at a conference: "I do not give a fuck.(...)"
"(...) that the prosecutor quoted from chat logs in which he for
anonymous hosting of everything, including child pornography,
recommended Tor (...)" (4)

I fully agree with Joe!
Running an exit can get you in serious legal trouble, because Tor /and
all other anonymity services/ will always be misused for illegal
activities. Every interested operator must make his personal moral
trade-off and come to a decision.
Sartre described such a discussion in a more extreme scenario in "Les
mains sales" (= Dirty hands)
Anyway, I decided not to run an exit but only an internal relay. And
to join German CCC and Zwiebelfreunde (Hello to the colleagues by the
way!). We operate really big relays, secured by professional admins.
Much better than I could setup at home as hobbyist w/o IT-education.
So you are an association and the legal risk and potential lawyer
costs are distributed.
Even the simple use of Tor is not w/o risk for everyday use:
I think one should have at least some basic knowledge about what the
Internet, SSL certificates, browsers, scripting and plugins are and
how they work.
Best regards

Hey Folks!
I would like to quote from the XKeyscore code (1)(2):
"// START_DEFINITION
These variables define terms and websites relating to the TAILs (The
Amnesic Incognito Live System) software program, a comsec mechanism
advocated by extremists on extremist forums.
$TAILS_terms=word('tails' or 'Amnesiac Incognito Live System') and
word('linux' or ' USB ' or ' CD ' or 'secure desktop' or ' IRC ' or
'truecrypt' or ' tor ');
$TAILS_websites=('tails.boum.org/') or
Obviously we on these lists belong to the most extreme dangerous
people one can think of :-)) . Pirate Party Luxemburg thinks the same
and offers for 20 EUR or 0.043 BTC a nice TORrorist Shirt (3). The
profit will be donated to the Tor project.
Best regards and stay wiretapped!

Quote from SIGINT Raw data:
"Im putting all my pride aside just to say that i will miss you dearly
and your the only person that i really allowed myself to get close to
after losing my ex husband, my dad and my brother.. Im glad it was so
easy for you to move on and put what we had aside and for me well Im
just soo happy i met you. You will always remain in my heart. I know
you left for a purpose it hurts like hell sometimes not because Im
needy but because i wish i could have been with you."
Many thanks to Mr. Gellman from the WP for publishing that
(anonymized) raw data!
I just read the whole article, in the last paragraph this highly
private mail exchange is cited.
=> I hope now the last user on earth understands what "intrusion of
privacy" means!
Stay wiretapped!

Thanks for the notice.
The German Heise publisher provides good information to IT-related
topics, but in German. I tried my Google-translate-link just before,
and it worked via Tor, perhaps you could switch the exit? Anyway, here

Thanks Cristopher.
Same situation here in old Europe. I am German, and our surveillance
service BND (= Bundesnachrichtendienst) does exactly the same. In
Frankfurt we have got the world's biggest internet-hub, the DE-CIX
(Continental Europe, Eastern-Europe, Near East ...).
And guess who is wiretapping and analysing /the whole traffic/?
Correctly, the BND. (1)(2) From 2004 to 2007 an unknown amount of raw
internet and telephone traffic was forwarded directly to the NSA, only
the data from Germans was filtered. (3) This measure was stopped
because our respected government (the circa 5 people who knew that,
that it became too delicate.
Well, actually the Greeks read the newspapers and think that mass
surveillance by the Germans is a bad idea. (4)
I am sure that every serious secret service in the world runs such and
similar programs.
=> We do not deal with an American "NSA problem". We deal with a
worldwide surveillance problem!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Project Is Sued / Austrian Parliamentary inquiry 
Hash: SHA1
This is NOT, I repeat, NOT a threat to Tor as misleadingly written
before on tor-relays and tor-talk. We are a constitutional state here
(believe it or not ...) and until now nobody has been convicted for
running a Tor exit.
In the case of the Austrian operator the illegal material flowing
through the exit was only the starting point for the trial. He was
then convicted for "contribution to deliquency" as I wrote on Sunday,
because the judges came to the result, that he accepted willingly
illegal traffic over his exit. This is a total other thing than
running an anonymity service!
His fate were these quotes:
"You can host 20 TB child porn with us on some encrypted hdds."
Chatlog. (1) Here the counter argument was, that he tried as a kind of
"private undercover agent" to get information about a botnet from a
criminal, forwarded it, and the chat partner was caught later (2).
Anyway, the opinion of the judges was another.
"I don't give a fuck" Documentated answer to the question, if he knows
about the child porn dealt over Tor. (3)
There are reasonable opinions from Austrian special lawyers that the
judgement is wrong, but the convict does not want to appeal.
There are other Exit operators in Austria w/o problems (4) and also
the Austrian Pirate Party writes, that Tor is *not illegal* (5)
So, but now there are open legal questions how to treat Tor. I would
like to quote from MacLemons Mail to tor-relays (6)
"From what I understand the goal is to get an official statement by
the Austrian ministry of justice that Tor falls under the legal
definition of a communications network. Which would mean, that
Relay-Ops are not liable for the traffic passing through their relays
given they
=> Whatever the result will be, this discussion needs to take place in
the public and the parliamentary inquiry helps!
I hope that Tor Exits will be treated more liberal in future, but
nobody knows. It should be in the interest of the Tor community to
conduct this discussion. If successfull, more volunteers will run
exits, so the percentage of the exits of our beloved surveillance
services should decrease :-))
Best regards, and: stay wiretapped!
