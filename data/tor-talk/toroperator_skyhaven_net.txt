@_subject: [OT] mitigating or defeating syntax analysis 
Most reasonable tor clients will go through the trouble to use an SSL/TLS-encapsulated protocol to make sure their communication isn't trivially readable at the exit node.
It's a little more work, but SMTP, IMAP and web browsing can conceivably all be enciphered even as it travels the normal internet.  Most Unix system administrators already know why to use SSH as opposed to telnet, for similar I'm under the impression that trying to use Tor to help obfuscate what you're doing beyond Layer 4 is using the wrong tool for the job.

I would assert a disagreement here, and indicate that "exitpolicy" is a *traffic* obstruction hook, not a censorship hook.
Key different: the ExitPolicy strictly works on the basis of the Layer3/Layer4 target address.  Your proposed censorship hook seems to require a continually updated set of blocks on the basis of content.  ExitPolicy can't tell an HTTP connection for wikipedia from an HTTP connection for a bit image.  Please see a reasonable reference for "usenet death penalty" if this is in any way

[mitigation details removed]
One day, you may find out the hard way.  Like any plan of defense, you only know about potential vulnerabilities in advance.
As for whether or not your account is safe to use anymore... Well, risk vs. reward, like anything else, informs the decision.  By your own admission, the risk is a little higher than it used to be.

Apply the same security measures necessary to authenticate a non-SSL connection without the use of Tor.

The ISPs and hosting providers tend to have agreements with their network providers that stipulate that the customer ISP take action to avoid stuff the provider doesn't like.  Such as phishing and break-in attempts, which are bad.  But also things like IRC usage (yes, even IRC Some hosting providers (not just ISPs) receive 100s of abuse complaints for various kind of stuff in a month.  Some of them may show up from process servers.

@_subject: How to ban many IPs? 
A reminder:
Your internet service providers may not be at legal risk, but they can nonetheless be held accountable for breaches of their own transit providers' terms-of-service agreements, and if your exit-node is found to be the cause of a given TOS violation, the ISP may end up disco'ing you for fiduciary or business reasons, not legal ones.
And before you ask, since these restrictions are generally considered content agnostic (for example: "all IRC is proscribed over this transit link"), an argument can be made that such restrictions are fair since it looks

Bear in mind that few ISPs care whether a break-in attempt was done at "your" instigation or "someone else's."  Think "botnet."

Scr?obh John Brooks:
All of the above is correct.  However, I sort-of feel that exit policy stuff w.r.t. keeping your hosting provider from being annoyed with you is the node operator's problem, not the Tor Project's problem.  All of the "default" exit policy blocks can be overridden by the node's operator, even ones like RFC1918 destinations which would be practically silly to remove.

Hi Scott,
When similar issues occurred to me with a hosting provider, the polite
but firm answer I got from them was: "We don't actually care about the
rights, etc. whatnot since the AUP reserves the right to disconnect you
at any time by choice.  In this case, the reason is because you are a
hassle to us due to the complaints."  After that conversation, my tor
exit node was downed.
Incidentally, I work at a (different) hosting provider.  We aren't
particularly interested in being defenders of people's rights.  If
someone cost us money or time in proportions we find to be excessive, we
assert the right to not renew or maintain a business relationship with
that someone.

At least on Linux, the traffic control facilities would permit traffic
shaping on the basis of the destination port for a connection.  See
 for more information in this regard.  With some more
"magic", such controls could be restricted to connections to a
destination port from the Tor process only.
It is an open question whether or not doing this is a nice thing to do,
particularly since it would not be "advertised" to the TOR process on
said box.
This has parallels w.r.t. the use of OpenDNS on an exit node in that it
is another traffic adjustment which:
- could have effects that would not otherwise be present on a system
using the standard DNS roots; and
- is not advertised to the TOR process running on the equipment on which
the TOR exit node runs

Right.  In terms of cost, I'm also considering the cost of our general
counsel fending off irritating cease-and-desist crap from various
rightsholders.  And the cost of having a support staffer be forced to
investigate a server because of a complaint from a third party.
In principle {RI,MP,whatever}AA complaints are handled the same as
Dos/DDoS/spam/UCE reports: we get too many implicating the same customer
and the customer gets booted.

@_subject: jurisdictional concentration of authorities 
Scr?obh Martin Fick:
Accurate enough.  ICANN may have the clout to eventually get a given IP allocation's recipient to act to suppress traffic from a specific IP, but ICANN doesn't directly have the ability to cause one IP address out of an RIR allocation to go dark.
 From a BGP standpoint, it doesn't work on the global BGP tables for everyone to try to do that anyway.  Many of the tier1 providers and their customers filter announcements more precise than /24.

I think Scott jumped the gun a bit.  It's true that if you use them directly as your authoritative resolvers (i.o.w. write them into Writing them in as the root hints for a full featured resolver (BIND, dnscache, etc.) works a lot better.
Ideally, you run your own caching resolver and have every other host in the local site use that caching resolver, which uses the root DNS servers as hint servers.
