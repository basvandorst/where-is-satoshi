@_subject: Letter from the feds 
Hi all,
my turn for a story to tell now. I run the TOR-server "wormhole" in Germany.
On the 28th of December I got a letter from the BKA (the german
Federal Office of Criminal Investigation). The content of the letter
was something like that:
"The owner of the IP-Addres $my_servers_address is suspected of
posession of child pornography. Hereby we order you to tell us the
real name of the owner and disclose all relevant logfiles according to
?113 TKG in the time of the 26th of October, 7:00 PST. We also demand
the names of all your customers which use your service and we inform
you that disclosing our request to your customers may be punishable."
Obviously I was a bit scared about the "the owner of the IP-address
part" so I hired a lawyer. The overall text was also a bit far-off for
my taste, but whatever. My lawyer sent out a fax yesterday to the BKA
asking if I, as his client, am a suspect or a witness. He also stated
that I'm running a TOR-server and that no relevant log-files according
to ?113 TKG exist. I case that I'm a suspect he asked for all the
files dealing with the investigation.
That was last night, today, about 20 hours later, we already got an
reply. The BKA acknowledged, that they understood my lawyer's
statement that the TOR-server does not create relevant logfiles and
claimed that this information is enough for their ongoing
investigations. Furthermore they say that they need no further
"statements" from my side. (which can be read as thanks, we're fine,
but who knows...)
Hm, they finally seem to have come to their senses. They really scared
the shit out of my wife and me, believe me. I don't know if their
floppy requests was intentional or not or if they wanted to scare me,
but that's nothing a lawyer can sort out.
Cheers, Alex.

The language wasn't offensive, it was still polite; I think that they

therefore pulled all strings the german law allows.
I wrote a similar letter but didn't send it, because I didn't know if
I was going to be suspected after sending out an explantion, that's
why I hired a lawyer.
Well, yes, however, I knew that something like this would happen any
time soon anyways.
I absolutely agree with the feds that they have to investigate for I
don't approve abuse of the TOR-network at all, especially not
On the other hand this is an improvement compared to what some LKAs
did in the last months, just randomly seizing machines without
bothering about how this could be related to anonymizing services.
So I actually approve the BKA's modus operandi, that's how it's
supposed to work. Just the style of the letter was scary.

Hi Eugen,
Not necessarily; if the BKA gets aware of a crime, they *must*
investigate (see also ? 258a, "Strafvereitelung im Amt"). And thats ok
how it is, if we're a real constitutional state it's supposed to work
that way, they just can't look away. TOR or not TOR.
On the other hand I share your feeling; somehow I have the impression
that they're using the letters to spread fear - and not everyone can
afford to hire a lawyer, as I did. That's actually the real problem,
that they're forcing people to act and maybe spend money.
And it also should be pointed out omce again that it would be a rather
stupid idea to run a TOR exit-node at home, for a dynamic IP-address
is blinking wildly on their radar. The possible consequences are left
up to your imagination.
It's probably the same lady from Wiesbaden we had to deal with as
well. After you've given your statement you'll probably get a fax
stating that they need no further information from you.
Hm, so this doesn't seem to be related. There's light! :)
Not that I'm aware of. Just monetary damage so far, which is quite
enough for my taste...

have a look at trans-proxy-tor and dns-proxy-tor, both available from

mileage may vary.
trans-proxy-tor is a transparent proxy that works with pf or iptables
to transparently redirect network traffic into Tor.
Included with trans-proxy-tor, this is a very simple DNS server
intended for plugging DNS leaks when using Tor.
Drop us a line if it's working, I was thinking about using that for my
public hotspot. It's next to impossible to run an open Wifi-network in
Germany without beeing frightened to get sued because of
copyright-violations or something...

OK, thanks for all your answer, I was a bit busy lately.
ShutdownWaitLength you mean? It's left to default - 30s. So yes to
your question.
Basically I shut down the server with "/etc/init.d/tor stop". (the
SYSV-style init-script Debian supplies)
What I found was that there were still lot's of differents sources
trying to reach my node on various ports, including ORPort. Well, if
that'd run for 5 minutes I wouldn't have written this email, but after
30 minutes I was still receiving lot's of stuff.
However; I'll try again with more thorough tests and come back if I
find anything even more weird stuff. So well, thanks all. Seems like
this is nothing to worry about, however, I thought (means: I haven't
checked the docs:) that after my node got deleted from the
directory-servers no inbound requests should happen anymore.
However, thanks :)

for maintenance-reasons I had to shut down my server today. However,

I hope so, although I wonder how "small" will be defined. How would

No; the point is if you'd qualify as an "access provider" you need to
enable "relevant logging". ETSI already defined interfaces and
data-sets which would come quite handy.

Well what you could do is remote-debugging.
Follow instructions to build gdb-sever for OpenWRT:
Install gdb-server
Run gdb-server on your WRT:
# gdb-server $ip:12345 /path/to/tor $myoptions
(Tor won't start immediately but will wait for a "cont" on the remote-debugger)
Set ulmits and run gdb an another machine on the network:
$ ulimit -c unlimited   # or whatever you consider a sane value
$ gdb
(gdb) target remote $ip:12345   # connect to WRT
(gdb) cont   # run Tor
...wait for crash and note output...
(Note: In the referenced URL above are more architecture-specific
notes for the WRT. I haven't tried this myself)
No idea if that will result in anything, but it might give some
information about what's really going on - like if it's a memory-issue
or something else. If the programm crashes with a SEGFAULT or
something, type "bt" in the remote gdb-session to show the backtrace.
Will be a lot of work, but maybe it's worth it.

Yes, it's stupid.
First, the legal issues. What he does is overtaking a TOR-user's
machine by malicious code. He's accusing people of being childporn
consuments based on the fact that *some* childporn keyword was found -
we all know how good that works! (just have a look at the available
internet filtering-software out there). I don't know about other
countries legislations but evidences which weer gathered illegally are
worth shit at court. So if you got a real child molester he'll be
found not guilty and when you find just some innocent dude you're
still going to destroy his personal life. Just the rumor "oh, that
dude does child-porn" is enough to destroy a lot of personal
Secondly: It's harming the TOR-project in two ways:
* TOR will lose valuable reputation and the rest of the world will
denounce us of bigotry.
* If the anti-child-porn patch will be applied the next lobby-group
will demand a backdoor. Why not the PETA? They could as for all
customers who bould furry clothes online. It's for the animals! Why
not the RIAA or MPAA? It's for the better good and the artists!

I'd point it out differently:
"Supporting a crime" - "Beihilfe" in German - is not someone can accuse

My lawyer clearly states, that in order to be guilty of "Beihilfe" you
need to actively support a certain crime. It's not "Beihilfe" just
because you provide the MEANS of a crime. Of some generic crime. It must
be a special incidident.
However, I can understand why you accepted the fact. A lawsuit is time-
and money-consuming. I'm just in the same situation and I already piled
up a couple of hundreds of Euros in lawyer-bills which I have to pay
On another note, good news: The court decided that I'm entitled for
compensation about the illegal search of my house. However, they forgot
to mention the arrest, so it's put back to court at the moment.
I don't know what that means so far, since being entitled doesn't mean
that I'd get any substantial money to cover my laywer-bills. It only
says that I can claim back money which arose from "physical damages".
And lawyer-bills and "mental" compensation is not "physical"...
However, Mirko, you should consider getting a lawyer and check if you
have the chances for an appeal. You need to be found unguilty. It's
important for you and for Tor in general.

Thanks Ringo, we appreciate that.
On another note: I'm currently reading all the emails and submissions I
got during the last couple of days. First: Sorry that I didn't reply
immediately, I was busy attending a seminar with my company the last
days and first had the chance to read my mails yesterday evening.
Also I got in touch with the Privacy Foundation and got some feedback
from the CCC. To make a long story short: Contrary to what I said
earlier, I think we should wait until the Privacy Foundation becomes
fully operational instead of founding yet-another-organization.
The Privacy Foundation was founded by lawyers and journalists who really
know what they're doing. I, as a layman when it comes to the german
"Vereinsrecht" ("Club Law"), couldn't do the whole thing without support
from experienced people anyway.
The Privacy Foundation wrote me an Email stating that they're thinking
of covering legal fees as soon as a critical mass of about 500 people
has been reached.
I just got in touch with them to discuss a couple of other things.
I noticed that at least one new mailinglist got created covering the
"Tor Legal Fund" thing and I'll be subscribing there.

Which means, if you really want to block Tor nodes from countries who
make logging mandatory, you should do this for all EU-countries. After
all, Germany is "only following the EU's demand for such a data
retention act".
I bet a fiver: If Germany really passes that law and if the Supreme
Court doesn't rule against that law, everyone else in the EU will just
follow (except maybe Greece...)
'Nuff said. Let's stop the nay saying ;) The law isn't active yet. The
law isn't even ratified. And no one even started logging. The lawsuit,
which's underway, isn't even filed at the Supreme Court. Yet.
We're living in interesting times, but there's no need to overreact.

Well, I was specifically coining that to Tor... I know that some
companies - especially T-Com - are reluctant to follow valid
legislation, abusing citizen rights - but it's so convenient for the

to stop them.

Puh, although I get the pun I wouldn't like the Stasi-reference in the

After all, the Stasi was an organisation known to abduct and kill, and
to harass an entire nation.
Though we're just facing some enormous changes in privacy- and
security-policy no one in Germany can say that "it's as bad as it was

Just one contra:
"Supporting $some_crime" always means that you knew about that certain
case they're suing you about. Since you can only know about something
if you start sniffing - which is strictly forbidden - you can't
possibly know about a direct certain crime.
Unless you were it yourself, using your own Tor exit-node, trying to
veil yourself behind this clever coupe. (yes, that's what one
policeman thought of me once...)
However, that doesn't protect you from Mickey Mouse investigation.

Hi Ringo,

However, your offer is valid and some kinda Tor Legal Fund (which was
discussed earlier) would make sense. There are still some open cases
(like morphiums's case, a student) which could need monetary help.
However, I'm not a lawyer and I don't know anything about how to set
up such a thing.
It's be easy to set up a Paypal-account, but it'd be not "non-profit",
means someone's got to pay taxes for this.

Interesting question. From what I understood a new circuit is created
for every TCP-connection. If your browser grabs, for instance, 6
images at the same time (6 loading instances == connections), Tor
should open 6 different circuits.
However, considering your question... It doesn't sound too efficient
to me... The slides say "If the user wants to access a different site,
Alice's Tor client selects a different path."
I'm curious how strict I should read that...
Site vs. TCP-connections?

However, that's all up to the implementation of the internal SOCKS-proxy, too!
Just think: Your browser might send out 6 different requests in
different connections, but you don't know what the SOCKS-interface of
Tor makes of it... It might try to be clever and queue it up to a
single circuit.
Not that this is bad, but interesting to know.
If we get an answer, we should put that up to the Tor Tech FAQ. It's a
pretty interesting question.

If you look at MUAs like Outlook - they just don't wrap correct, so the

just tend to write without pressing "Enter", hoping that the receiver's

It looks like one of the nodes you have a connection too just kicked you
out for some reason ("connection reset by peer"). This is pretty normal.
Could be the remote node shutting down the software, rebooting and such.
Not sure about those, but it could be consecutive errors resulting from
the encrypted connection (TLS) being shut down.
No idea about that though. But it usually takes some time until everyone
learned about your node - from my experience it takes up to 24 hours
until the bandwidth is fully utilized.
I'm just guessing from my generic experience :)

I ain't no Windows-advocate but I find this argument a bit weak.
Nowadays all the modern operating systems have the same problems: To
much installed services by default, weak administration and the general
reluctance of users to pay attentions to security-updates and
best-practise when it comes to using common sense.
Though there's a technical problem with Windows which Roger explained on
his talk at 24C3 [1], it eventually runs out of sockets due to the way
Windows allocates non-pageable memory-areas.

@_subject: Applications Recommended For Use With Tor +++ PROPOSAL, DRAFT +++ 
Hi all,
following up a discussion on  I made up a Wiki-article about the
abovementioned subject.
Abstract: To create a list of "Applications Recommended For Use With
Tor" [2]. Those applications must obey the rules of
1) using the proxy supplied
2) not leaking any information around the proxy
Disclaimer: This is work in progress. This is only meant for your
information. It's not a formal process, nor a written thing. I just put
it for discussion. It's up to you to define the rules.
Motivation: Tonight we were discussing if [1] is a reasonable thing or
not. I pointed out that Tor, as a layer-3 routing-software, can't solve
layer-4+ problems and that it should be up to "downstream-proxies" to
solve the "untrusted TCP-port"-problem.
However, several people disagreed with my opinion, pointing out that the
real problem are the applications using Tor, compromising the anonymity
of the user and the IP-address-obfuscation of the router.
The real thing would be solving all those problems directly in the
applications instead of sailing around the problems, using proxies and
the such.
Later, the point about Tor-safe and not-safe applications popped up -
thinking of DNS-leakage, unsafe browser plugins. Those problems were
reported before on this list about several products - related to several
versions of those individual applications - but except the archive of
this list this pieces of information _were never consolidated_. We just
have a bunch of warnings that a certain application $foo in version $bar
leaks DNS.
Goal: To create a list of "Applications Recommended For Use With Tor".
That'd give users a certain degree of confidence that the application
(s)he's using isn't leaking information to the world when using Tor.
I'd appreciate your comments and I'm awaiting your corrections on all
the articles in the Wiki. (free registration required).
The Wiki-article isn't linked to anywhere in the Wiki yet. That's on
purpose until we sorted our all the basic questions.
I'll be willing to set up a dedicated mailing-list for this subject,
unless we can have on elsewhere.

OK, that's another thing.
Naaaa, no way. A couple of questions:
1) You run some kind of transparent proxy?
2) If not, check if Tor is really disabled. Use ps in UNIX or the
Windows Taskmanager to check. Shut down Tor.
3) Check all your IRC-client's settings.
To be more precise:
4) What operating system are you using?
5) What IRC-Client are you using?
The error-message you're describing is hand-crafted for people who want
to use the Freenode-network with Tor. It wouldn't appear for any other
users (unless Freenode borked up their scanners).
By the way, the message "Closing Link: 127.0.0.1 (Banned)" seems to
indicate that you're using some kind of proxy.
