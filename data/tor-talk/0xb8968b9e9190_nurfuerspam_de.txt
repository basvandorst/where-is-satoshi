that the contract has been terminated without notice.

Yes, a small webserver is installed as a hidden service, but is
listening on address 127.0.0.1 only. Connect to the hidden service over
Tor is working perfect.
No - port 80 ist 'NATed' to port 9030 and port 443 to 9001 in my
DSL-Router. The advertised DirPort ist 80 but bound to 0.0.0.0:9030 as
you can see in my origin posting ('/etc/tor/torrc').
   WAN ---->[DSL-Router]-------->[m0n0wall]-------->[Tor/Web server]
      443/80   (NAT)    9001/9030          9001/9030
In the m0n0wall-log I can see the request from e.g. 64.34.166.71 to port
9030 of my Tor bridge. But there is no "/tor/server/authority.z" on the
box and the answer '404' seems to be plausible.
Now, I stopped the webserver for a while, but no change:
May 31 22:53:47.378 [warn] Your server (*.*.*.*:80) has not managed to
confirm that its DirPort is reachable.
This warning comes every 20 minutes.

I noticed the same problems with 'ssl.scroogle.org' - not even a 'ping'
was replied! On 2008-09-29 I switched my Tor node at home from an exit
node to a middleman node. Yesterday there where no problems with direct
connections to 'ssl.scroogle.org' anymore.
So I switched my Tor node back to an exit node and as soon my Tor node
was listed as 'exit': same problem! No direct connect to
'ssl.scroogle.org' is possible nor 'pings' are replied.
I wonder, why these guys block IPs of Tor exit nodes ...?
