ExperimenTor is based on ModelNet, which runs *only* on FreeBSD 6.3.
(The emulator core runs on FreeBSD while the edge nodes can run any
Linux distribution.) So scalability in many ways is restricted to the
resources that the FreeBSD 6.3 kernel can access.

The key here is "showing a different IP address", which means that
TorBirdy is not connecting to the same exit node. The error message
seems to indicate that trying a different exit may fix the problem
(since you are using Tor Browser, click the "New Identity" button.)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Messenger 0.1.0b4 is released 
We are pleased to announce another public beta release of Tor Messenger. This
release addresses a number of stability and usability issues, and includes the
default bridge configurations for pluggable transports.
The initial public release [0] was a success in that it garnered a lot of
useful feedback. We tried to respond to all your concerns in the comments of
the blog post [1] but also collected and aggregated a FAQ of the most common
questions [2].
* Before Upgrading
Before upgrading to the new release, you will need to backup your OTR keys or
simply generate new ones. Please see the following steps to back them up [3].
In our eagerness to build on work done by Tor Browser, we made the decision to
store your profile directory inside the application bundle. This complicates
matters when you want to use the same accounts and keys across updates,
especially while we don't have an automatic updater [4].
Also, as was vociferously pointed out by some of our early adopters, this
probably isn't a very intuitive user experience. Copying the extracted
application to someone else's computer would unknowingly transfer your
accounts and OTR keys. It's unclear if this is commonly done and we'd love
feedback on this point to understand the urgency of the issue.
In future releases, we plan on revisiting this decision. The number one item
on our roadmap is porting Tor Browser's updater patches [5] so that keeping
Tor Messenger up-to-date is seamless and automatic. We also plan to add a UI
to make importing OTR keys and accounts from Pidgin, and other clients, as
easy as possible [6].
* Downloads
Please note that Tor Messenger is _still in beta_. The purpose of this release
is to help test the application and provide feedback. *At-risk users should
not depend on it for their privacy and safety*.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBirdy prevents Thunderbird loading multi-OS bug: 
As we have pointed out in the tickets related to this issue, the reason
we have not released a fix is because we have not been able to reproduce
the bug, at least based on the information we have. Many users have
reported that they fixed this by creating a new profile and then
installing TorBirdy which leads me to believe that this may be related
to a conflict with some preference we are setting.
To all users who have this issue: try creating a new profile and see if
that works for you? If it does, please comment on the relevant tickets.
Bonus points if there is something on the error console that is worth
looking at (Ctrl+Shift+J).

============================== START ==============================
Tor Messenger is an instant messaging client currently under
development. It is designed to make connections using the Tor network
and will therefore be a valuable piece in the privacy-enhancing software
toolkit (web: Tor Browser, email: Thunderbird + TorBirdy, chat: Tor
Messenger.) Based on the Instantbird IM client, Tor Messenger:
 - sends all traffic over Tor,
 - enforces Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR) for one-on-one conversations
   by default,
 - can be used with a wide variety of chat networks,
 - has an easy-to-use graphical user interface localized into multiple
   languages.
* Current Status
Today we are releasing the third alpha version with which we hope to
gain both usability and security related feedback. There have been two
previous alpha releases to the mailling lists that have already helped
smooth out some of the rougher edges.
* What's New in Tor Messenger 0.0.6
- Support for Windows and OS X builds (in addition to Linux)
- Improved privacy and security with network and application-related
  enhancements
- Improved usability of the Instantbird OTR extension
  - Private key and known fingerprint management
- XMPP in-band account registration support
- Build localization support (currently Arabic; Chinese, Spanish, Farsi,
  and other languages coming soon)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Are webmail providers biased against Tor? 
Mike Hearn from Google addressed this issue on the tor-talk mailing list
in October 2012, where he said this:
"Access to Google accounts via Tor (or any anonymizing proxy service) is
not allowed unless you have established a track record of using those
services beforehand."
This was in response to several TorBirdy users complaining that they
couldn't access their Gmail accounts over Tor. As someone who used to
have a Gmail account and used TorBirdy over it, there were occasional
periods where I couldn't access my account over IMAP and had to log in
through the web interface and unlock it by entering a CAPTCHA. This was still better than what some other users who used Tor over Gmail
reported -- in some cases, Gmail would force them to provide a phone
number where Google would call or send a SMS before you could use your
account. The surprising part here was that Gmail wanted _any_ phone
number in _any_ country and not a number previously associated with your
account.  I am unsure how this helps them and what is the purpose behind
asking users to register with a phone. If one were to assume that they
wanted to know the location of the user, then why would they allow the
user to enter the number of any country?  (A friend confirmed this
recently and had to enter a phone number to unlock the account. Gmail
refused to allow access until a phone number was entered, where they
could call or send a text.)
So yes, it seems like Gmail doesn't favour users using Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Can't log in to Facebook or use Facebook via Tor 
We are finalizing the FAQ, but till then, here is what you should try:
    If you are having trouble getting Tor Messenger to work with Facebook, follow
    the steps below.
    - Start by noting that the username field in Tor Messenger is your Facebook
      username, not your email address. Your username is the text after
      facebook.com on your profile page. (If the link to your profile is
      facebook.com/johndoe, then your username is johndoe.) If you still can't
      find  it, go to "Settings", under "General", see "Username".
    - Make sure chat is enabled:
        Click the settings icon ("wheel") in your chat sidebar
        Select Turn On Chat or Turn Off Chat
    If you still can't connect, in addition to the above step, try using an app
    password:
        Go to your Security Settings
        In the App Passwords section, click Edit
        Click Generate app passwords and then follow the on-screen instructions
    Then use this password instead of your usual Facebook password to connect to
    Tor Messenger.
Try this and let us know if it works? (Or if it didn't work.)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Messenger Beta: Chat over Tor, Easily 
Today we are releasing a new, beta version of Tor Messenger, based on
Instantbird [0], an instant messaging client developed in the Mozilla
* What is it?
Tor Messenger is a cross-platform chat program that aims to be secure by
default and sends all of its traffic over Tor.  It supports a wide variety of
transport networks, including Jabber (XMPP), IRC, Google Talk, Facebook Chat,
Twitter, Yahoo, and others; enables Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging [1]
automatically; and has an easy-to-use graphical user interface localized into
multiple languages.
* What it isn't...
Tor Messenger builds on the networks you are familiar with, so that you can
continue communicating in a way your contacts are willing and able to do. This
has traditionally been in a client-server model, meaning that your metadata
(specifically the relationships between contacts) can be logged by the server.
However, your route to the server will be hidden because you are communicating
over Tor.
We are also excited about systems like Pond [2] and Ricochet [3], which try to
solve this problem, and would encourage you to look at their designs and use
them too.
* Why Instantbird?
We considered a number of messaging clients: Pidgin, Adam Langley's
xmpp-client, and Instantbird. Instantbird was the pragmatic choice -- its
transport protocols are written in a memory-safe language (JavaScript); it has
a graphical user interface and already supports many natural languages; and
it's a XUL application, which means we can leverage both the code (Tor
Launcher) and in-house expertise that the Tor Project has developed working on
Tor Browser with Firefox. It also has an active and vibrant software developer
community that has been very responsive and understanding of our needs. The
main feature it lacked was OTR support, which we have implemented [4] and hope
to upstream to the main Instantbird repository for the benefit of all
Instantbird (and Thunderbird) users.
* Current Status
Today we are releasing a beta version with which we hope to gain both
usability and security related feedback. There have been three previous alpha
releases to the mailing lists that have already helped smooth out some of the
rougher edges.
* Downloads

            The sha256sums.txt file containing hashes of the bundles is signed with the

B297 B391).
* Instructions
- On Linux, extract the bundle(s) and then run: ./start-tor-messenger.desktop
- On OS X, copy the Tor Messenger application from the disk image to your
  local disk before running it.
On all platforms, Tor Messenger sets the profile folder for
Firefox/Instantbird to the installation directory.
- Note that as a policy, unencrypted one-to-one conversations are not allowed
  and your messages will not be transmitted if the person you are talking with
  does not have an OTR-enabled client. You can disable this option in the
  preferences to allow unencrypted communication but doing so is not
  recommended.
* Source Code
We are doing automated builds [5] of Tor Messenger for all platforms.
The Linux builds are reproducible: anyone who builds Tor Messenger for Linux
should have byte-for-byte identical binaries compared with other builds from a
given source. You can build it yourself [6] and let us know if you encounter
any problems or cannot match our build. The Windows and OS X builds are not
completely reproducible yet but we are working on it [7].
* What's to Come
Our current focus is security, robustness and user experience. We will be
fixing bugs and releasing updates as appropriate, and in the future, we plan
on pairing releases with Mozilla's Extended Support Release (ESR) cycle. We
have some ideas on where to take Tor Messenger but we would like to hear what
you have to say. Some possibilities include:
- Reproducible builds for Windows and OS X (
- Sandboxing (
- Automatic updates (
- Improved Tor support (
- OTR over Twitter DMs (
- Produce (and distribute) internationalized builds (
- Secure multi-party communication (np1sec) [8]
- Encrypted file-transfers
- Usability study
* How To Help
Give it a try and provide feedback, requests, and file bugs [9] (choose the
"Tor Messenger" component). If you are a developer, help us close all our
tickets [10] or help us review our design doc [11]. As always, we are idling
on IRC in  (OFTC) (nicks: arlolra; boklm; sukhe) and subscribed to the
tor-talk/dev mailing lists.
Please note that this release is for users who would like to help us with
testing the product but at the same time who also understand the risks
involved in using beta software.
Thanks and we hope you enjoy Tor Messenger!
