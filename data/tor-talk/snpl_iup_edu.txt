@_subject: website fingerprint attack research 
I am an undergraduate computer science major interested in doing research.  I want to tackle the website fingerprinting attack, the first research problem listed on the Tor volunteer page.  I just wanted to make sure I'm not duplicating someone else's effort (if there is someone else working on it now) or stepping on anyone's toes.
