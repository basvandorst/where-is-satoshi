@_subject: [tor-talk] Latest update fails to carry NoScript whitelist forward. 
Today I updated my Tor installations on GNU/Linux and Windoze 8.1.  In both cases, the update program carried forward my bookmarks, but did not transfer the list of URL's in NoScript's whitelist.  It just took a moment to find an old white list and fix things.
This is hardly the bug of the week.  I just mention this because beginning two updates ago, both bookmarks and whitelist URL's were carried forward.  Before then I had to export them to files, update Tor, and then import them.  I got lulled into complacency, I guess, and stopped doing that.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Invaded by disconnect.me 
Perhaps someone could help me here.  On version 4.5.1 of the Tor (Firefox)
browser, the search field, to the right of the place to enter the URL, now
has a symbol on it that is proprietary to disconnect.me.  I have also
found that while working on the WWW, from time to time a screen comes up
from direct.me asking me to enter search terms and to select the search
engine to use.
It appears that disconnect.me has hijacked the search field in Foxfile,
and also found a way to interpose it's own search screen when URL's cannot
be found.  I have done nothing to make this happen, and unfortunately
don't know what I can do to make it go away.
Can anyone explain why this is happening?
Until now the default search engine for Tor was Start Page, but that's
gone.  Is Tor no longer using Start Page as the default search engine?
I expect this kind of thing with a standard browser, but I thought Tor and
Foxfile had pretty well locked things down to prevent this kind of thing
Any thoughts?
