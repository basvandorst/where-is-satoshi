I laugh. Authorities aren't supposed to be able to show you the photos
they've found to make a request to take down a box, am I right? I thought
that went to a judge/court to get a legal order.
They don?t always go to a court first, often preferring to just take their chances with a ?kind? request - but I?ve worked in hosting for quite a while and have *never* received any such imagery with any request. I can?t imagine why they would do that. Perhaps (giving him the benefit of the doubt here) he means that when investigating reports he has seen some of the illicit material? when checking it?s validity? Still seems a bit sketchy.
Anyway, the silly and aggressive response to such a simple question, from such a high-up member of the company, is enough to put them on my shitlist in my opinion - so thanks for the heads up...

On the contrary, it makes me feel that my freedom is being used to
provide an environment where some of the damage done by people with your
misguided viewpoint can be mitigated.

So called 'vanity' addresses are essentially a brute force - generating
tons of keys until you get one that starts with the prefix you want. The
difference is that 'bob1d8rhdu2h.onion' is a lot less specific than
facebookwwwi.onion - if Facebook can brute force arbitrary strings like
that, they can instead brute force, say, , or
 and then impersonate it.

Indeed and I hope they share too - I didn't mean to imply any knowledge of
the incident, just explaining in plain language why brute forcing is
involved, to people who are confused.
