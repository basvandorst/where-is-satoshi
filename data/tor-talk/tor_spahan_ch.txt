I have a Tor Exit Node at Hetzner.
The statement in the tor-wiki seems valid.
I limited my Tor traffic to 100k since i use that server for other stuff
too. I never hit the 2TB-limit, so i can't tell what would happen. I
assume no problem if one pays $$, according to this
I get tons of complaints from copyright-owners about Bittorrent (they send
to hetzner, hetzner forwards to me), but even when i stopped answer those,
hetzner did nothing.
Hetzner will give my contact data to authorities if asked, at least the
police said so in the last email. I dont consider this bad.

you may want to turn this off since it may leak information to outside.
Those are state settings for torbutton. i dont think you should change them.

cookies disabled on mac. good for privacy. you may want to use a plugin
like cookiesafe to manage cookies in a more controlable way (the "always

This decides if you get a warning before open urls that will be handled
by external application. Eg, click a mailto://-link and it opens your
mail-application. Your mac will open mail and news without asking if you
click a link.

No, i mean NOT to play around with those since they are used by
torbutton internaly. (eg, disable TOR, go to about:config, check them.
Then enable TOR with torbutton go to about:config again (be sure to
reload that page) and check them again. They should now be changed.
disable tor again and they should go back to original.)
Yes. if your concerned about safebrowsing change them.
I think the hidden wiki suggestion is correct. this will make FF not
open any external apps at all. opening external apps can be dangerous
since no one knows if those external apps use tor or not and they could
do even more evil stuff.
Actually, doing some google search i found out those settings are
bugged. Playing with them had no effect on my system which i dont like.
If they WOULD work, i suggest to change them, since then you get at
least a warning window before open external applications.
If you set external apps handlers to false as suggested by the hidden
wiki, those settings don't do anything.
- From a reply to that bug it apears to me, that the torbutton people
dealed with the problem in some way, but i didnt mind enough to dig
deeper :-p

     -n      Do not do any DNS or service lookups on any specified
addresses, hostnames or ports.
     -X proxy_version
             Requests that nc should use the specified protocol when
talking to the proxy server.  Supported protocols are ``4'' (SOCKS v.4),
``5'' (SOCKS v.5) and ``connect'' (HTTPS proxy).  If the protocol is not
specified, SOCKS version 5 is used.
     -x proxy_address[:port]
             Requests that nc should connect to hostname using a proxy
at proxy_address and port.  If port is not specified, the well-known
port for the proxy protocol is used (1080 for SOCKS, 3128 for HTTPS).
Maybe your nc was compiled without proxy support? Where you got it from?
I have distant memories of me compile the gnu nc version once because I
had a weird implementation of netcat on my system.

@_subject: mirror.noreply.org expired keys? 
Hash: SHA256
I tried update my lenny box today, and got a error for the
mirror.noreply.org TOR repository.
W: GPG error:  lenny Release: The following
signatures were invalid: KEYEXPIRED 1279490902 KEYEXPIRED 1279490902
KEYEXPIRED 1279490902 KEYEXPIRED 1279490902
W: You may want to run apt-get update to correct these problems
Searching the internet I got a solution, updating the keys (obviously)
So first step was:
# gpg --keyserver  hkp://wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net  --refresh-keys
gpg: requesting key 94C09C7F from hkp server wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net
gpg: key 94C09C7F: "Peter Palfrader" 75 new signatures
gpg: Total number processed: 3
gpg:         new signatures: 112
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
running this again said "no changes" so I think, this worked.
Now I did:
 --armor --export 94C09C7F | apt-key add -
But I still get the expired message from above.
Removing Peters Key changed the error to:
W: GPG error:  lenny Release: The following
signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available:
NO_PUBKEY CFF71CB3AFA44BDD
W: You may want to run apt-get update to correct these problems
Looks like Peters key is the key which is used for mirror.noreply.org
I purged the key from apt and gpg (gpg --delete-key 94C09C7F and apt-key
del 94C09C7F) And started from scratch importing the key from keyserver,
adding to apt-key.
But apt-get and aptitude still say expired key.
Any idea what is wrong?

@_subject: [tor-talk] segfault at 8 ip ... error 4 in tor 
I built a new gdb (from the homepage), and got the output below. I too
tried rebuild tor from the source (apt-get source,
dpkg-buildpackage,...) and both times the stack trace looks like this. I
do not understand why gdb does not find the tor-dbg symbols, i installed
them and squeeze gdb finds them, but not the new gdb (i tried the
map-debug configure option and used the -s Option to directly give the
path, but nothing worked)
Does this help? or how should I proceed?
PS: i do not get the crash with debian stable package, i am using the

Yea, i think i need some help with it.
I made tor dump core at crash, but I'm not sure if that file is useful.
I think I need debugging symbols?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Connecting Vidalia with Private TOR Server 
Hash: SHA256
Hi, i have done that some time ago.
If i recall correct, you have to edit the vidalia torrc file and set
the DirServer variable to use your directory server. You can not do
that from the GUI as far as i remember (but i didn't used vidalia
since some time).
Unfortunately i don't remember where the vidalia torrc file was located.
