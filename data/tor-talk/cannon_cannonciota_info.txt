@_subject: [tor-talk] Not comfortable with the new single-hop system 
Hash: SHA512
Good point.
I believe the new single-hop is a great option for some situation such as if a website does not need to be anonymous but yet would still like to have a .onion address so users can still remain anonymous or take advantage of the higher security of .onion addresses over that of clearnet, and with advantage of less latency over that of a full hidden service.
However you do bring up a good point. This new single-hop system should remain a feature, but should not come as default but should be an "add-on pack" that should have to be downloaded or compiled seperately.

@_subject: [tor-talk] A possible solution to traffic correlation attacks, 
I have had the idea of randomized micro delays between each node for long time, but have been told by many in the Tor community that this is bad idea for low latency network. I know that Tor has stated in past that they don't claim to protect from a GPA. But we must realize that the true threat is a GPA which must be dealt with by collaborating on solutions to protect from global view traffic analysis. Another idea, if micro delays would not work out for low latency anonymizing networks such as Tor would be to perhaps add padding, randomized padding between each node. If micro-delays and/or padding is bad idea, then other solutions should be discussed.

Hash: SHA512
Open source and compiling from source is best option. Hopefully there are enough programmers that are able to interpret the source code examining it. Although the source code may be good, most users do not compile from source. Most users install pre-compiled binaries. If I was an adversary I would have the source code clean and have a backdoor in the pre-compiled binaries knowing most people do not compile from source. Most people is all it takes for a sybil position in the network. To mitigate such a thing, one good solution would be to replace 'apt-get install tor' with instructions of how to download, verify integrity, and compile from source; in guides aimed at aspiring Tor node operators and advanced users.

Alot of people like to say "if you have nothing to hide you have nothing
to fear",  these are the same kinds of people who live in a dream world
constructed from their personal biases in wanting to believe the world
is all well and that there is no corruption or abuse of power, and the
USA government is not corrupt and would not target its own citizens.
They are in denial of the truth. The USA government illegally targets
its own civilians in many scenarios. Not because those civilians are
doing anything wrong, but for simply existing. They are all scooped up
in the automated dragnet systems put into place. Though sometimes some
civilians are selected for more targeting, either through automation or
manually. Not because those civilians are breaking laws, or criminals or
any threat to public safety, but because they are sysadmins whom either
have access to networks and systems, or because those civilians choose
to take safety measures in this dangerous hostile cyber-world, whether
that be using linux (NSA xkeyscore targeted civillians whom researched
linux among other software), or Tor to name a few.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor honeypot 
Hash: SHA512
What is "ofc" ?
What would be advantages of having it disconnected from Tor network? Having the honeypot not listed in the Tor directory servers would only detect scanners or adversaries that identify targets based on port number. If I was an adversary I would just refer to the directory server for listings of Tor routers instead of doing internet wide scans which could take up to a day. If concerned about "normal Tor traffic" acting as a cover for malicious traffic, then perhaps sort log data through a filter omitting traffic based on following criteria:
1. OMIT traffic to/from known Tor Nodes and their listed ports, WHICH ALSO INCLUDES traffic pattern matching normal Tor traffic.
So what this filter would do is omit traffic between your honeypot node and other Tor nodes, while bringing to attention traffic that is connecting to/from non Tor routers or non Tor related ports or traffic that may be connecting to other Tor routers/ports but with non standard Tor traffic.
So even if an adversary is mass hacking Tor from a Tor router as cover, this would likely pick up traffic that is not matching that of standard Tor traffic.

Hash: SHA512
Flawed CA System leaves Tor Browser users vulnerable to remote hacking and passive spying in bulk
Lesson 1: The CA system, and https (due to CA root certs, export grade crypto dowgrade attacks, openssl, cloudflare MITM) is and has always been flawed.
Leson 2: You should always assume you are hacked the moment you use a webbrowser, this is why you should always use a disposable sandbox for your web browser.
Solution 1: Remove all root certs from your system because the CA system is complete rubbish anyways and false sense of security. Only trust connections and network routing protocols that are based on cryptographic proof (i.e. .onion or .b32.i2p addresses) rather than based on trust (as in CA system). And always assume that most clearnet addresses are unecnrypted connections, if this bothers you then dont use clearnet addressees, and perhaps businesses should use modern network protocols instead of legacy insecure networks (plain ipv4, clearnet)
Solution 2: Always run browser in disposable sandbox. And create new instance whenever logging into an account through web browser.
These problems are not issues that are presented by using Tor, this is an issue with any browser. I propose tor browser updates to run inside of disposable sandbox, and throws up a warning whenever users try to access clearnet sites along the lines of "WARNING: you are leaving the Tor network to access a the legacy clearnet internet which is vulnerable to various attacks (this is an issue with any browser accessing the legacy clearnet, not just Tor Browser). Proceed with no expectation of security or privacy, and it is recommended to use the .onion address equivalent of destination you are trying to reach if available.
If no .onion address is available for this destination, tell the site admin to upgrade their website to a modern routing protocol
You may call me crazy if you want, or even paranoid, but I am correct.
Oh yeah... and if you think the latest update to Tor Browser will fix any of these issues, you are mistaken.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Use of TBB behind a physically isolated Tor router? 
Hash: SHA512
Thank you for the prompt reply, thoughts and links to read up on.
My reasoning behind wanting isolation is due to the many cases of the
past in which certain adversaries were successful in identifying a Tor
user after compromising the system either through a browser exploit, some
0day etc... because only that specific application was configured for Tor and
not the whole system. This is why Whonix (and Qubes OS which uses Whonix) separates
the Tor gateway from workstation via virtualization. Even with software isolation
though I am beginning to think that hardware isolation when implemented properly
is more secure than software isolation, with all the Xen bugs recently. I know
that it can be an issue with background applications sending identifying info,
and while this can be mitigated by not using some noisy sketchy OS like Mac OSX or Windows that spies on users, the risk will still be there. In the past I have used stream
isolation to address this. I have played around with stream isolation for each destination address and also with setting stream isolation based on destination port. Thoughts on stream isolation for this?
Of course other precautions would need to be taken, such as removing the internal wifi and bluetooth
card to prevent any compromise from identifying location. Along with not using the same computer
or OS for personal use and other uses they dont want correlated with them (but shouldn't this already be a
That was my first intended usecase was more protection from being de-anonymized with the physical isolation.
The second usecase is for applications that are hard to configure for Tor or not made to work with Tor, to have it just use Tor with no application level configuration needed.
The third usecase, people sometimes use Tor not necessarily to be anonymous in but to conceal their location.
If one was concerned about an exit node sniffing their data, my philosphy is that they should not be using
plaintext anyways.
You do bring up a good idea of simply having the physical device just act as a firewall to block non Tor traffic
instead of having it act as the Tor process. I will explore this idea to see if it would work for my usecase.
Is there any comments on the way Whonix gateway and TBB work together?

For me I do much more than 10 and eventually give up because it never lets me through.
But really google captchas should not even be used because they require javascript. With javascript code
google can identify you by your mouse movements which are unique per person. This is either a way to identify
tor users to real life identity or correlate multiple identities that would otherwise be seperate. Or it is a way
to basically harras and block Tor users from using the internet. Most website admins are horrible people by knowingly or
unknowingly having google captcha or cloudflare on their website, and are taking part in the war against human rights of
privacy. Another person I saw, thought that google is purposesly making people fill out multiple endless captchas because
they are using humans to train AI through recaptcha against their will.
