@_subject: [tor-talk] Best way to anonymize email while still be allowing to 
The goal is to hide my ip (I have dynamic) when sending and receiving
email. Remailers wouldn't fit since they wouldn't allow to receive messages. In
addition, I'd like to host a local mail server. I think tor could help,
but would correspondents need to be use tor in order to email me? How
would this need to be configured. I use evolution, so I'd prefer to use
it for this.

I don't how I could hide my ip from my ISP, but if anyone knows how, I'd
like to hear it. However, I meant to hide the ip from recipients.
To hide the ip.
There is no such need.
I read it, though am still not clear how this applies to a local server,
which is what I'm planning on using.  If I use tor to proxy evolution to
a local server, wouldn't the recipient still be able to see the server's
(mine) ip?
It would connect like this, evolution --> tor --> local mail server -->
recipient. So there's no ip anonymisation in between the mail server and
recipient. However this server ip should be hidden.
The other question that still remains, would the recipient need to use
tor to communicate with me if my server is torified? If so, is there
some way of bypassing that need without compromising the hidden ip?
If anyone can offer suggestions, I would appreciate it.

I can use thunderbird then.
I suppose the following was in reply to this:
independent IP and be accessible via tor locally and externally wouldn't
it (if the routing is setup properly)? Tell me more. How would the routing need to be set up?
quit simply because most of the recipient email systems would reject my
sendmail - it wasn't registered so (I assume) the systems (yahoo, gmail,
etc) probably thought I was a spam house or something and so would
reject any mail I attempted to send.
That's helpful to know. Are you saying the recepient wouldn't even see
mail from me in their spam folder?
it may tend to break your anon unless you religiously keep that FQDN on
tor so that no hostname search will ever pull up your real IP.
No, because I haven't set up the server yet. I'd like to plan out
everything first to make it fully anonymised. How do I keep the FQDN on

@_subject: [tor-talk] nesting proxies 
Using firefox 3.6, vidalia, polipo, I'd like to know how to tunnel tor
through another proxy, and further nest proxies. vidalia's proxy
settings seem to mean proxy -> tor, because detects that I'm using tor even though using a proxy. Since tor is
blocked on certain websites, I'd like to tor ->  proxy [-> proxy ->
proxy, etc].
