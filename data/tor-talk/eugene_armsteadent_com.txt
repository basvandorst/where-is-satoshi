Hash: SHA1
Here's an issue...
I have AVG Anti-Virus System running on my machine and it just recently
did a scheduled scan of my hard drive.  It is telling me today that
tor-009pre4.exe is a virus of the name "Trojan horse Proxy.12.AL.  I
have had this version of tor on my machine for some time and AVG scans
my machine daily.
I'm going to make some assumptions on what could be happening:
1.  A recent virus definition updated caused the recent flagging of Tor.
2.  Tor isn't really a virus, but just doing it's job... or always was a
virus... or just acts like one... I dunno, I'm not that smart.
3.  Tor recently got hacked and the whole network is at risk.
4.  I'm just crazy.
The machine I'm having a problem on is a Windows XP Pro Version 2002
Service Pack 2 Box.  I'm running AVG 6.0.818 with Virus Database 556.
This is an issue of concern for me as I run tor on several different
machines, one specifically being a full time Onion Router.  Can someone
help me out?

Hmmm...  So you are running tor-009pre4.exe on a windows machine too?
Obviously I should install the latest version, but I think I should also
mention that Tor was running at the time the computer was scanned.
Maybe just a glitch...

Good to know I'm not crazy.  That's the same thing that I did, but I wonder if someone hasn't found a way to backdoor Tor.  I guess that's why we have been advised to run Tor as an unprivileged user and in a chrooted jail on *nix.  I run Tor on a dedicated Linux platform and don't want to see it rooted.
My whole reason for the post was to make sure that the users of the network, and the developers were aware that either by design or by accident, that Tor is being reported as a virus/backdoor proxy.  Maybe it's being read wrong, or maybe someone found a way to manipulate the code and exploit the network contrary to it's design, or maybe it's just another method of control by the proverbial "Man" to keep the masses thinking they have some sort of anonymity while monitoring their every move.  I dunno.
Enough of my rant, what I do know is, the world needs some sort of outlet for free thinking, free speaking individuals.  I can only hope that this network doesn't get censored like Jap and others.

@_subject: Funning log entry... 
Hash: SHA1
I was looking at my logs today, and there was an entry from last night
that rather disturbs me, here it is:
Sep 29 22:30:15.175 [err] d:\documents and settings\nickm\my
documents\tor\src\or\circuitbuild.c:1081: ???: Assertion r failed; aborting.
What's really baking my noodle is the fact that I have no user "nickm"
on my machine, and I'm not too happy with the idea of Tor looking for
stuff on my machine that's not in the config file.  Speaking of, here's
what I have in my config:
SocksPort 9050
SocksBindAddress 127.0.0.1
LogFile D:\progra~1\tor\warnings.log
LogLevel warn
DirPort 9030
AllowUnverifiedNodes middle,rendezvous
entrynodes samson
strictentrynodes 1
I am using Tor as a client, but also allowing it to mirror the
directory.  I run my own router and use that as an entry point.  Can
someone please help me out?

@_subject: m0n0bsd 
I was just wondering if anyone has tried to install Tor on m0n0bsd
  I'm thinkin about setting up another OR and
installing it on a CF drive in a standalone box with m0n0bsd as the OS and
I'm hoping someone else has had a success story.  I've been using m0n0wall
for my wireless captive portal quite successfully for some time and I like
the minimalist aproach of m0n0.  Any info would be helpful!

I figured out what my problem was.  It seems that the old rfc1918 reserved for much more than the 10, 172, and 192 networks as seen here   My firewall was blocking rfc1918 private/reserved address spaces according to the old implementation that providers seem to be allocating addresses to nowadays.  One of the directory servers is on an old reserved address space and my firewall was keeping it from seeing my or.

Thanks for the info!  Restarted firewall on OR and TOR is reachable now. I have to research what my problem was, apparently wasn't TOR.  Thanks

I believe my actions were a coincidence the more I observe things.  My OR seems to just have a problem with 86.59.5.130.  I don't know why that one server should be cause my OR to just give up but it looks like that's what was going on.  It just started happening the last few days as you can see here Yeah, mine seems to be working fine now.  I believe TOR has reached sentience and hates me.  LOL
