@_subject: [tor-talk] Not able to download Tor to droid 
Still have not been able to download F-Droid and Orbot.  How do I enable Downloads to keep running and not immediately shut itself off after being enabled?  Without being able to download and install Orbot,  the RCA Tablet is no more than a paperweight.  Do any of you know of any highly qualified list servers for droid users? This apparently is a droid problem.  After using Tor for years in Windows, it's hard to believe it's so difficult to download this software to a tablet.   --  If it's not easily downloadable and installable, many would-be users will simply walk away.  So far, the $125 for the tablet seems to be a waste of money.  Is useless without Tor.  Has certainly wasted quite a bit of time.  Not ready, however, to give up.  Will have to thoroughly learn the droid operating system. Again, appreciate all the responses.  Priority:           High

I enabled Downloads on the droid tablet.  When I went to launch it, the
operating system remarked Downloads stopped running.  How do I enable Apparently, this may be why I cannot download F-Droid and Orbot.  Any
ideas? libertyinperil

Did a factory reset on the droid tablet. Was finally able to properly download Orbot. As well as Orfox.  Is Orfox necessary for Orbot to work properly?  Firefox installed is not enough as it is with Windows?  I was able to get to the Tor browser page and it verified it was indeed Tor.  When I tried typing in a new url, however, it redirected to Orfox.  Interestingly, the same IP comes up each time I boot Tor browser.  How do I change the IP?  There is no onion to click on that will allow that to happen. Thanks.  libertyinperil

Thanks for the info.  Still don't understand why I'm assigned the very same IP every time I start Tor on droid.  How does that protect my anonymity if I'm assigned the very same IP every time?  Also, how do I change the IP as provided for on Windows Tor?  There is no onion to click on the droid Tor.  Also, on Windows systems all you have to do to download Tor is to download it from Firefox.  It's much simpler.  That's what I meant in the first message, -- not that Firefox is sufficient as a stand alone browser. libertyinperil

@_subject: [tor-talk] Orbot 
Guardian Project does not seem to be supporting Orbot.  Sent two emails to Support which were ignored.  After several factory resets, however, was finally able to download Orbot from the Guardian Project to the RCA tablet via direct download.  When you click on Browser, a window appears instructing the user Orfox is not installed and would the user wish to install it?  If you click No, the Tor page comes up saying ?This is not Tor? and the IP is not changeable.  If you click Yes, Orfox does not download.  Nothing happens.
If you click VPN, Tor does properly start.  If you swipe the onion, the IP changes.  When you check the IP, the Tor page comes up with contradictory messages.  On the top of the page it says, ?Congratulations.  This browser is configured to use Tor.?  On the bottom of the very same page it says, ?However, it does not appear to be Tor Browser.?
If you check further through Downloads, it states VPN mode is experimental and data may be shared elsewhere throughout the network obliterating privacy.  What network?  If you disable VPN, and swipe the Tor onion, the IP does not change and you cannot browse.  If you enable VPN and go to any URL, the browser does access the URL.  How can I be sure, however, it is actually Tor that's doing the browsing and not the generic browser on the droid actually doing the browsing and then calling home to Google?  -- You cannot uninstall the generic browser.  Just disable it.  You can uninstall Chrome and I have done so.
Have subsequently uninstalled as many of the droid apps as the machine would allow.  Since the droid does provide a guest user function, however, how can I be sure that even with all the apps uninstalled and/or disabled on owner mode of operation, the tablet is still not ?calling home??  Does Orfox need to be installed and operational for Orbot to properly work?  If so, how do I get the droid tablet to properly download it instead of ignoring the request when the Yes icon is clicked?
So far, this tablet is no more than a paper weight.  Cannot be trusted for anything other than downloads of news sites and other URLs that do not require log in.  None of the droid user groups seems to be current.  Are several years old and not currently operational.  Worse, have not been able to find any truly comprehensive guide online regarding the droid operating system.  Intend to continue working on these issues.  Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Thanks for the information.  Didn't mean to offend only reported the fact there were problems with support.  Will take some time for me to study the information you provided since I am not a tech or software engineer.  Have absolutely no familiarity with droids only Windows.  Have used Tor for years on Windows.  Have had this tablet for about a month and have had numerous problems regarding download of Tor to the droid.  Bought the machine because it has a keyboard, is tiny and lightweight, and has an advertising battery run time of some six hours.  As an investigative publication, security is exceptionally important to me.  That's why I've been so careful about using the droid before I fully understand the operating system.  I did not mean to imply I used the generic browser to surf.  It was only used to initially download Orbot.  What I still was not sure of was whether the news sites subsequently downloaded were via Orbot or the generic browser due to the seemingly contradictory statements on the Tor page that you have cleared up for me.  Thanks for your time and trouble.  Deeply grateful.  Will take a little time for me to digest the material you covered.  Will not download anything from Google since they track.  Have tried to download F-Droid and use it, but have had problems with the repositories and how they are to be used.  Also, I have not been able to find any version of the Windows-based Filezilla that I can use on a droid to upload my publication.  Even if all I'm able to do with the droid is download non-log-in news research, it will be of benefit.  Again, thanks.

No Script has been disabled.  How do I get around this problem? Although having used Tor for years, I am no expert at this. Not being
able to use No Script has compromised security.  A number of websites
are now asking for my agreement to allow third party cookies and
tracking. Any assistance with this would be most appreciated.
