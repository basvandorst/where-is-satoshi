@_subject: [tor-talk] stronger anonymous macosx 
Hi Tor community,
I would like to know if we can boost anonymous and security on mac os x. Because a simple install of tor browser could be a little light for anonymous web. I look for a stronger tor with a max of security on mac os x. How I can tuning it?
Thank you.
