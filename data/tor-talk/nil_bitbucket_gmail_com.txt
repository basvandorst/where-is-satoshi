Yes, I have those settings (I'm using the Tor button extension for  Firefox) and it worked fine yesterday, but today it will not connect  to any site. I do have the latest stable version with Vidalia  installed, so that shouldn't be an issue.
Any other suggestions?

No, it's running; Firefox even says that. But it just won't connect  to any web site. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and it  doesn't change anything. It worked on Sunday, and I haven't changed  anything or installed anything, either.

Firefox displays the 503 error page, saying " This is Privoxy 3.0.3  on localhost (127.0.0.1), port 8118, enabled"
"Connect failed

No, it's running, as I made sure to use the startprivoxy.command file  in Terminal. I've checked the config file and it's as it should be;  no changes have been made. Torbutton is configured correctly, too.

On MacOS X, where are Privoxy and Tor supposed to be installed: in / Library, or in ~/Library?
I've tried installing, uninstalling, and reinstalling in both  directories, but it still doesn't work in Firefox, or even if I  change the Network settings to Torrify Camino and/or Safari.

Hmmm...then it's installed correctly and running, but I can't connect  to any site using it; I get the same 503 error page as before.
I'm not sure what else I can do. It was running perfectly on Sunday,  I haven't installed any new software or removed anything that might  be related to it, and everything else on my system runs the same. I  even tried uninstalling Torbutton and setting up the proxies manually  in Firefox, but that didn't work, either.
What else can I do? This is very frustrating.

Yes, I've checked the Tor config file and it's the original that is  installed, no changes by anyone, since I'm the only user. Also  checked the Vidalia log file, and here is what it says:

So, any ideas as to how to solve this problem?

I've restarted Tor several times, even restarted my system, and I  still get the 503 error, even though Terminal and Vidalia both say  Tor is running. I'm on OS X PPC and Vidalia is a fat binary, but I  stripped the Intel code from it, as I had before this all started  The output of "ps auxwww | grep Tor" is this:
424   2.7  0.1    27376    424  p1  S+    7:43PM   0:00.01 grep Tor
I just tried launching Vidalia and going to the Tor menu to turn it  "On" and tried Firefox again, and it worked. But this makes no sense,  since I've never had have Vidalia running to use Tor when I was  running 10.3.9.
Any idea what's up with that, and do I really have to launch Vidalia  every time I want to use Tor?

I didn't try this; I just went to Login Items in the Accounts pane  and added tor to it. I checked /Library/StartupItems and Tor is not  in there, even though I installed it using the Installer package.
There is no tor.log in the /var/log/tor, and no CrashReporter in / Library/Logs/; just Console and DirectoryService.
Should I move or copy something to /Library/StartupItems, or anything  --Spin Doctor

No, I don't run Vidalia unless I need to do something. I've never had  to use it to start Tor under 10.3.9, as it's supposed to start  automatically. Since Tor isn't in StartupItems anymore after  installation, there must be some shell script I could create and put  in their so it starts up that way.
Unfortunately, I don't know how to do shell scripting.

Yes, that's the directory I'm referring to, and Privoxy is in there.
However, I believe I've discovered the problem, and it's something  that was overlooked by the developers: there's no torstartup.pkg  included in the installer for the latest version of Tor and Vidalia  bundle. But, if you go to the download page for "experts" and  download that package for OS X (Tor-0.1.1.24-tiger-ppc-Bundle.mpkg),  it is included, whereas Vidalia is not.
So I downloaded that package and installed it, and now everything  works as it did before.

No, that would only start Tor when I start Vidalia. I'd have to make  Vidalia a Login Item for it to start automatically.
Yes, I've got that.

No, I just want the Tor package for "experts" to actually start  itself and Privoxy at startup and work. I had this installed before  and it worked fine under 10.4.10, but since updating to 10.4.11, it  doesn't work anymore. Even if I uninstall it and reinstall a fresh  package, it still doesn't work, so I was forced to install the non- experts package with Vidalia, which I never wanted to use.
We need to figure out the problem with the startup scripts and why  they don't work, even though they did startup automatically. I know  this because I tried to startup manually and the OS said another  instance was already running.

No, there aren't any tor error messages in any log file. I tried  uninstalling Tor, Privoxy, and Vidalia and installed a fresh copy of  the "experts" package and connecting to a site using Torbutton in  Firefox, and once again I got the typical error:

I've been running the Tor, Torbutton, and Privoxy combo on Mac OS X  for a long time, but when I recently updated to 10.4.11, it stopped  working, even though it's supposed to start up automatically when I  login every day. All I got were error messages saying that Privoxy  was set to a host that wasn't responding.
Finally I uninstalled it and installed the Tor, Privoxy, and Vidalia  package and it works, but I have to manually turn it on now, since  there are no startup scripts for Tor and Privoxy with that package.
Does anyone know what could be causing this problem, and how to fix  it? I hate using Vidalia when I know Tor and Privoxy can startup  automatically, and that's the setup I want to go back to and use.
