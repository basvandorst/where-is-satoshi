Hash: SHA1
I've setup a notary as a hidden service.

The point of this service is not my anonymity but to ensure anonymity when
requesting validation of certificates. I'd welcome any feedback.

I'm a bit late to the party, but I was taking a look at the Cables project
form the Liberte Linux distro. Here is the project page:
The short explanation is that it attempt to implement a PKCS AKA CMS. [
This is an interesting project that attempts to leverage Tor hidden
services to share communications and X.509 certificates to verify identity.
I'm wondering if anyone has looked into this on the list.

That's cool. Thanks for replying. Yeah I saw the randomize retries which is
nice. The crypto appears to check out (maybe with a few points of
My initial reaction is that crypto is at least following some kind of
standards, but transmission of those CMS messages via GET requests to a
custom HTTP service running on each box. Also, although it is pretty
obscured from accidental discovery thanks to Tor, this service spits out
identifying information. Lastly, there seems like a likely scenario that a
third party could at least verify that a message was exchange between two
accounts. Is this a misunderstanding on my part?

I don't know the anti-spyware tool that you used nor details about what the
tool deems a "screenshot" but I want to point out that in Windows
(especially older versions) one of the entropy sources for OpenSSL is the
screenshot of your current session[1]. So if the Tor Browser needs to
generate keys (and it usually does in your use case) it is possible that
the crypto functions are calling whatever "rand" sources are available on
your system, including first taking a screenshot of your session.
Just a theory that IMHO seems more likely that your browser package being

Can anyone from the Tor Project jump in to say whether these guys have
reached out or not?
We should be concerned about another CCC-style "0-day" presentation where
they find a legitimate vulnerability that could have been patched prior,
but are using it as a PR stunt to boost book sales as opposed to
responsible disclosure. Alexander Volynkin [1] and the grad student Michael
McCord, [2] both stand to benefit professionally/financially from
disclosing a vulnerability in as dramatic form as possible.. and of course
picked up and misinterpreted by the media.
I'm raising this concern based solely on the negative phrasing in the
drugs, and malware. Anyone

Worst case stated, I don't want to hate on researchers -- the two should be
praised for their research if they have something new and they've already
been working with the Tor Project team to get it resolved.
If I were a betting person, a beer says that they will be summarizing the
current issues with hidden services, and as Adrian said, doing a client
side disbanding attack (e.g. Java + DNS)

Looks like you have "Torproject" instead of your distro name. This should
be "lucid" or whatever is the name of your distro.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Raspberry Bridge Project 
This is a link to the Raspberry Bridge Project: I designed a custom Debian-based Raspberry Pi image for Tor (I know there
are dozens out there already [1][2]) with the goal of making it very simple
for any user to run an Obfuscated Bridge Node and have a stable operating
environment. The OS is built from the ground up with Debian Wheezy and is a
few hundred MB.
Some of the features:
- latest stable release of Tor compiled for the RBP architecture
- torpi-config tool that provides a text-based UI to walk them through the
process of setting up a bridge
- minimalist, hardened OS with temporal logging
- keeps obfsproxy up to date on a regular basis
I'd put it all on github but it's about 200mb. So everything besides debian
is on there.
* Source code for custom scripts:
* Design Document:
* Torpi-config Tool:
* Tor deb compiled for RBP: * [BONUS] Tor Ascii Art:
I have a lot of improvements to make, but it's fully functional. The next
revision will expand the torpi-config tool to cover updating Tor, managing
a watchdog service, and returning the specific ports needed to be forwarded
by the application.
Feedback appreciated.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Workshop at a Con 
I remember seeing that one of the recent goals for the Tor Project was
to do some outreach at cons[1] with possibly running tables at events
etc. I was planning a Tor + Tails (along with some other privacy
subjects) workshop for a local BSides. I have the workshop written up
but thought I could reach out in case anyone was interested in helping
from an unofficial or official perspective (aside from shipping Roger
+ Nick to Upstate NY :P).
The demo is people that have at least tried Tor - but the hour+
workshop will spend most of the time on (IMO) "advanced" subjects like
interacting with the control port, using some of the less popular
torrc options, and getting started with Stem. Then going into how
Tails is made.
Feel free to reach out off-list if you'd like.

My fact checker 9000 looked into this[1]. the 0.3% is probably close but
here are a few stats per Zmap and Alexa

- of the entire ipv4 space, 2.8% use SSLv3 as their highest version

@_subject: [tor-talk] Facebook brute forcing hidden services 
There are a lot of tools out there that generate vanity hidden service
addresses. Facebook merely used something like Shallot [1], or they
purchased the hidden service address off of one of the domain brokers that
are hosted as a hidden service. Generating an address does not mean
cracking an address.

It appears that someone has been issued a facebookcorewwwi.onion cert
from another CA as .onion has no way of verifying a collision.

It can scale up to (AFAIK) any size you want. I'm looking for feedback if
