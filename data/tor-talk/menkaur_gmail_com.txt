@_subject: [tor-talk] How do I change tor's outgoing IP address? 
I'm experimenting with tor command protocol, and I've found a command, which
seems to be able to designed for changing IPs: `SIGNAL NEWNYM`.
I'm sending this to tor via tor's command port, and I'm getting `OK` in
However, when I test tor's outgoing ip several seconds and minutes
afterwards, it does not change. I'm doing the testing via a proxyjudge
script located on an external server.
Why? Is it possible to change the outgoing ip? And if yes, how do I do that?

The exit node is easy. The simplest way to test it is by googling through
tor "what is my ip". That's your exit node. Not sure about the rest

Is it possible to change the tor's socks5 port? I've looked through options in Vidalia and through the documentation, and I
can't find anything of the kind

Hey! Thanks for the reply.
My current torc looks like this:
                 # This file was generated by Tor; if you edit it, comments
will not be preserved
                 # The old torrc file was renamed to torrc.orig.1 or
similar, and Tor will ignore it
                 ControlPort 9051
                 DirReqStatistics 0
                 HashedControlPassword 16:----
                 Log notice stdout
                 SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1
What should I change for tor to listen to localhost:9051?

I don't think Vidalia can do it. You'll have to edit your torrc file
That said, 9051 is typically the control port, so you'll probably be
screwing things up and inviting confusing error messages by setting your
socksport to 9051.
