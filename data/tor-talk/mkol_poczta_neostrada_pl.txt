Remove the 20KB/s limit and I will run a server (6KB/s max).

@_subject: Upload limit 
Does Tor have any option to limit upload speed? BandwidthRate option limits only download speed.
I have 1024/256 ADSL. My ISP is using large buffers (about 512 KB) and unlimited upload causes high pings - over 4 seconds. Currently I disabled DirPort and the upload speed is almost the same as download speed.
Is there any way to limit upload speed without disabling DirPort?

@_subject: QoS Solution? 
It won't work because many filesharing applications are using small (100-200 KB) chunks. Prioritizing small files would only prioritize filesharing apps such as Gnutella clients or eDonkey2000 in "Horde" mode.
The only fair QoS is equal bandwidth for every client. It works great for example in NAT gateways, but it can't be used in Tor because someone can open 10 Tor instances and get 10 times more bandwidth.

@_subject: QoS Solution? 
If you decide to add this stupid QoS please add an option to disable it.
Why do you think that downloading 100 chunks 200 KB each should be faster than downloading one 20000KB file? Actually 100x200KB only would cause higher overhead than 1x20000KB.
Tor must have either perfect QoS (each USER, not connection gets the same amount of bandwidth, no matter what service - filesharing or WWW) or no QoS at all. No QoS is better than QoS per transferred bytes or per service.
QoS per service works properly only in single-user environment.
When PNG graphics format was being developed (many years ago), I was always saying that W3C should either add perfect gamma correction or no correction at all. They completely ignored me and added gamma correction that doesn't fully work. Effects of this:  It made PNG worse than GIF.

Open (or forward) your BitTorrent port. Set your port to something in 1024-65535 range.
Don't use these ports: 1214, 4661-4672, 6346-6347, 6881-6889.
