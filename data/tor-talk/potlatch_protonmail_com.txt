@_subject: [tor-talk] Abuse complaint 418289 
Good day Tor operators,
One of my VPS providers has requested that I block exit output to ports 22, 465 and 576.  I have never received a request like this before even though I have (now or in the past) operated almost 40 Tor exit relays in diverse countries.  The host making this request is understanding and the service excellent.  He sees these ports as generating the most abuse complaints.
Question:  Is this a reasonable request and how much critical communications would be booted if I block these ports.  I think my alternative to blocking as requested would be to close these accounts and find another host.
Please help,

Sorry, I thought the purpose of the Tor network was to provide anonymous communications to people--including ssh and email access.  When I first received the "request" I was a bit miffed that someone would tell me how to operate a VPS that I lease and correctly operate.  And there was no problem that generated the request--it came out of blue air.
So, thanks to you, I've learned my lesson:  "ALWAYS do what people ask of you."
By the way, do you operate Tor nodes or just spew morality at people?

Hello ops,
How do I safely upgrade my Tor exits from trusty?  I have the rude warning staring at me from arm and nyx.
