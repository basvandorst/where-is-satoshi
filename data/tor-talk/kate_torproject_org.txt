@_subject: [tor-talk] Medium removed the captchas for Tor users! 
I don't say much on Tor-Talk, but I will say this:
Thanks, Medium, for removing all those CloudFlare captchas for Tor
users. As an activist from East Africa once reminded me, the Internet
means *all* of the Internet. Otherwise it isn't quite itself--it is
meant to be accessible and comprehensive; a nearly inexhaustible catalog
of the world.
Thank you for helping out.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Day of Action: Is the FBI targeting YOU?? 
Greetings, Tor Talkers!
The US Department of Justice is trying to institute new rules that would
let the FBI hack computers that use Tor and other
privacy-protecting technologies--all over the world.
EFF and Tor are asking you to sign a petition or (if you are a US person
in the US) send a note to a member of Congress to stop this.
For background, check out our blog post:
TO TAKE ACTION---> go to torproject.org or stopglobalwarrants.org
Judges would still need a warrant, but under the new rules, those
warrants could apply to thousands more people--and computers and phones
anywhere are vulnerable if they use privacy-protecting technology like
Tor or a VPN.
The rules are an amendment to Rule 41 of the US Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure (rules for US judges). They will go into effect on
December 1, unless we stop them. They would greatly empower US law
enforcement to snoop into people's computers -- making sweeping changes
to US policy through a technicality--without Congressional oversight.
Picture the abuses against journalists, members of Congress, activists,
or everyday citizens that could occur under these new rules if the DOJ
(and FBI) get their way.
EFF and Tor have partnered to launch this Day of Action designed to
raise the profile of this critical issue.
Please sign the petition or email a member of Congress using the banner
at TorProject.org or the campaign's website: NoGlobalWarrants.org--but
remember that the new rules will apply to computers and phones all over
the world--so everyone's voice is critical, no matter where you live.
US Senator Ron Wyden is leading a bipartisan effort to defeat the rules
with a bill called the "Stop Mass Hacking Act" ( that's a
good hashtag for Twitter.
