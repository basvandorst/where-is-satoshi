Tor Messenger *definitely* shouldn't log by default. This defeats much
of the purpose of private chat, and many people back up unencrypted to
the cloud. I think the OTR people specifically suggest that you don't

What? Obviously I don't think it's theoretically unloggable. But
silently, automatically saving plaintext to a user's storage is inane.

Dual_EC_DRBG, a random number generation algorithm, was very likely
backdoored by the NSA. Tor doesn't use it. There is little evidence that
other EC algorithms have been subverted, although it's possible.
Here's a good resource if you're interested in learning more:
Speculation about the integrity of crypto algorithms is only one facet
of auditing the security of protocols like Tor, and it isn't always the
most fruitful one.

Facebook stopped supporting XMPP and recently broke XMPP compatability.
This is likely the problem, and there isn't an easy solution. James
Geboski's libpurple plugin is the main open source implementation of
their new proprietary protocol, IIUC.

Recently, their XMPP server silently began assigning authenticating
users strings of random digits (e.g. 0329802437509 at facebook.com,
approximately) as usernames. I remember a core Pidgin dev with a lot of
protocol experience saying that accepting this response is either unsafe
or a protocol violation (maybe both). However, most clients do, and
therefore still work with Facebook.
Regardless, having a username like that isn't very usable. I think there
are new issues with fetching buddy lists, too.

Again, they dropped XMPP support recently. I can't imagine they'll ever
support it again.

It may still work, but they pretty publicly and controversially dropped
support, so I doubt they'll reverse that for Tor Messenger's sake. I was
clarifying that because Sukbhir mentioned asking them about supporting

Not necessarily a bad idea, but could be a waste of system resources on
a laptop.
And, as has already been mentioned, they might as well run Whonix or
Tails if they're using a VM.

This is too little. Think about how much bandwidth a single user
can/should use when downloading a big file. A common and understandable
mistake, though (I've been there).
The best option is usually to set a monthly bandwidth limit with
AccountingMax and AccountingStart. The Tor daemon will disable itself
when the limit is reached, and enable when the monthly start time
passes. Until the limit is reached, it won't throttle bandwidth at all.

Why not just a cron job with pkg_add, apt-get, or whatever else you use?
There are existing tools like Debian unattended-upgrades for this.

Last I checked, it was still using AES-128. It's much faster, often an
order of magnitude faster because of hardware acceleration, and is
extremely unlikely to be the weakest link of Tor's crypto.
