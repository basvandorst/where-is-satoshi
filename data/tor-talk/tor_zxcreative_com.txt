I'm trying to set up a pretty decent server on our 50 meg leased line
and I am having difficulty in doing it.
We have a bunch of IP addresses and we have to use port forwarding to
rote it to an internal IP address.
I have done that bit, (Both TCP and UDP), however the logs are showing:
Jun 08 07:49:38.166 [warn] Your server has not managed to confirm that
its DirPort is reachable. Please check your firewalls, ports,
address, /etc/hosts file, etc.
I have set in the configuration file the public IP address, and not the
internal IP address. Any outbound traffic ends up going through a different public IP
Hope someone can help...

Thanks Roger and Karsten..
I think that its set up now, I'm just waiting for the server to come
back to say that its visible. I can certainly connect to the ports
remotely with telnet, so thats good..
