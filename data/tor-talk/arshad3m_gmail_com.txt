thank you very much. then if the user uses tor for his all browsing
purposes, from the isp end how does they see this? shouldnt they know
which sites the user visits? if dad request the bill include all the
sites the son visits what would the give? is the user shown as a peron
who doesnt use internet or what will be there recorded for where the
dns request came from etc?

if the ISP doesnt know, which sites the user visit. then they cannot
provide the sites visited with the bill if the user requests it?
AFAIK all ISPs provide visited sites upon request right?
thank you.

thanks for your reply.
i mean to avoid this:
Eavesdropping by exit nodes
In September 2007, Dan Egerstad, a Swedish security consultant, revealed
that by operating and monitoring Tor exit nodes he had intercepted
usernames and passwords for a large number of email accounts.[17] As Tor
does not, and by design cannot, encrypt the traffic between an exit node
and the target server, any exit node is in a position to capture any
traffic passing through it which does not use end-to-end encryption,
e.g. SSL. While this does not inherently violate the anonymity of the
source, it affords added opportunities for data interception by
self-selected third parties, greatly increasing the risk of exposure of
sensitive data by users who are careless or who mistake Tor's anonymity
for security.[18]

thank you very much for your reply.
the the ascii art really helped.
now i have two doubts in this.
1) is no one able to decrypt the tor's encryption?
2) how can i trust the person who runs the tor's exit node?
optional -3) [forgive me if it is too silly]
why people run TOR nodes? is that only to support the community or other
benifits as well?
thank you very much.
best regards.

hi all,
forgive me for my ignorance.
may i know why governmetns fund TOR. i read 49% funds coming from
government. TOR is usually considered for passing government restriction
by journalists and activists. so why should governments fund this?

thank you very much for this.
is this a project supported/acknowledged by torproject?
and can you please explain this below?
The only known disadvantage is that it cannot host Tor hidden services
which would require other services (e.g. http), and their resources
(e.g. hard drive space), in addition to the Tor server itself. However,
as a middle or exit node, it is ideal.
thank you very much.
