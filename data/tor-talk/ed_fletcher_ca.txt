Is this what you're looking for?
They sell all the parts but the instructions are there if you want to get the pieces elsewhere.

Nobody has mentioned the Tails crowd-funding campaign here.  The website states that Tor is to be one of the beneficiaries.
They have raised just over $28.000 so far and it has only been active, I believe, for a few days.

This one is a wireless Raspberry Pi access point using Tor:
I'd like to see the reverse setup; connect to the RPi with the cable and then to a wifi network using Tor.  Most hotels only have wifi these days, not a wired connection.

On a related note, does having (what I assume is) a serious percentage of the Tor relays in the Amazon cloud make it easier for the NSA to compromise anonymity?

My mistake.  I had thought that a bridge was a relay with extra functionality.  I'll have to do some more reading.  And thanks for the tip on the slides.  I'll look for them after Defcon is done.

This is something that I have also wondered about.  Why go outside of the Tor network to check that you're using Tor?  Access to any hidden service would be proof positive that you are connected.

I too would be interested in seeing how this actually works.  I'm concerned by the need to 'activate' the unit on the manufacturers website before using it.  Once you buy the hardware, there should be no need to tell anyone that you have it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Open Source Router 
There has been lots of discussion on this list about the Safeplug, which didn't garner much enthusiasm from the list members.  I haven't seen this project mentioned:
An open-source software and hardware router for Tor, vpn, etc.  Being open-source, it eliminates a lot of the concerns expressed about the Safeplug.  The downside is it costs US$400.  It's being crowd-funded via Indigogo and they are seeking $200,000 to get it going.  I really don't know if they will be successful or not.  Too early to tell.
It seems to me that a project similar to DD-WRT but specifically aimed at providing Tor would be a _lot_ less expensive.
What I do find encouraging is the number of Tor related projects that are springing up in the aftermath of the NSA revelations.

Some years ago I used a computer as a router.  No hard disk inside, booted off a write-protected floppy with Coyote Linux on it.  It worked fine but it sucked electricity and made way too much noise.
So I like the small dedicated routers, just not for $400.

I haven't looked at OpenWRT in quite a while.  I'll take another look at it.  Thanks for the pointer.
I also have a Raspberry Pi that is currently, um, underutilized.  The lack of Gigabit ethernet isn't an issue on the external connection.

Have a look at the archives for this mailing list.  There was a discussion about this starting on 22/11/2013.  Most opinion was negative for a number of reasons that I won't reiterate.
The discussion started here:
