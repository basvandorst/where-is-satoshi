I have been running tor, jap and privoxy on Solaris10/SparcV9 for ages.
No problems ever.

Looks to me, as if Pidgin actually has some trouble with Yahoo's
protocol. I actually am unable to connect to Yahoo via Pidgin, too. No
matter, if proxy is set to polipo+tor (Gnome default) or just socks5
(individual settings for Yahoo IM).
Usually these issues get fixed quite soon by the Pidgin maintainers.

@_subject: Server networking 101 - lack of documentation 
Am 23.07.2010 16:27, schrieb Olivier C:
Your VPN and Tor do not have anything to do with each other. They are
completely different services, doing their own networking. So to connect
from outside, you don't need VPN. Just use your server's SOCKS port
(9000) and maybe polipo. Or let polipo forward SOCKS  to your server.
Just for a quick glimpse: any internal networking on the same physical
machine is done via the loopback interface. It's handled exactly like a
physical interface, so you can connect to 127.0.0.1 the same way as to
any other machine. That's actually "how different services coexist" on
your server and everywhere else. No real need to get deeper into details
for this, but you might find some more here:
Details to the basic protocol behind Tor (Socks, RFC 1928):
Forwarding of VPN connections to  Tor (not really necessary, but in-deep
documentation of port-forwarding)
