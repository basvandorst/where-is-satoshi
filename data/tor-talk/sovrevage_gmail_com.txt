The problem is that it does not scale 1:1.
If you set aside the biggest problems:
- Users with firewalls/NAT routers and lack of knowhow to set them up correctly.
- Increased use increases incentives for the bad guys, _especially_ if
a vulnerability is discovered. Everyone would be vulnerable.
- Anonymous users can simply be port-sweeped (and/or banner-scanned) for.
The reason it does not scale 1:1 is that (in EU at least),
Internet-access to the users are provided mostly asymmetrically. My
new connection has an awesome 20Mbit downstream, and the whole of
1Mbit upstream. Even with the fastest (consumer) subscription I'm not
able to host a TOR server if I'm also going to use other services
(VoIP, etc.).
And I wouldn't approve of the whole forcing-people either, at least by
my own moral standards, especially not in a freedom-project like this!

That's a great assesment xiando. Say that this actually IS NSA (for
which there is no proof afaik), why automatically assume it's because
they are hunting down thought criminals?
The NSA Mission Statement is posted at  :
"The ability to understand the secret communications of our foreign
adversaries while protecting our own communications -- a capability in
which the United States leads the world -- gives our nation a unique
This might as well be an effort of the latter as an effort of the
first. But ofcourse, we'll never know for sure...

To protect integrity and confidentiality you should use end-to-end
encryption. This is not only particular to Tor but goes for most
Internet communications. SSL/TLS (as used in https) provides
end-to-end encryption and will prevent your communication from being
However, you should be careful to examine that the certificates of the
remote server is signed and does not change. If they do change you
might be attacked by a man-in-the-middle attack, where you indeed are
talking securely, but directly to the attacker :-)
