Network issues happen so I don't see the point of this thread :)
Not to mention your google suggestion returned nothing recent.

Don't see any explination from them yet on this however what I see so
far isn't all that uncommon. I don't really consider Verizon as a major
ISP even though they are doing FiOS. I still see them more as a cell
phone provider.  This would be more of an issue if it were someone like
Level3 or Comcast that were affected IMO.

NGO means  non-governmental organization so I would assume it is
probably someone like the ACLU, EPIC or EFF that just wishes to remain

Perhaps people can get around this by using their own internal resolvers
and/or ipsec tunnels?
Are ipsec tunnels legal there?
Perhaps a good case for a "darknet" inside Iran?
