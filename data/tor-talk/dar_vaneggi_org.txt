@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidalia exit code 127 
Hi all
Yesterday I have updated TBB.
It has worked fine until this morning, but some minutes ago I have run TBB again and get this error:
Vidalia exited abnormally.  Exit code: 127
As suggested here, I have downloaded the 64 bit version
and now is working correctly.
Someone know why this error has come now and not this morning?
