Doesn't seem to be an issue with Tor. I get the same message from a non-Torr'ed IP address in Germany registered to Arcor (a big ISP in They simply block all non-US users. And if you happen to use a non-US based Exit Node, ABC won't let you in.

I tried out some different exit policies after getting a big load of
DMCA notices. My provider didn't really mind forwarding them to me but
it got me started playing with the exit policies as I don't see any
reason for me donating (expensive) bandwith for filesharing over Tor. I
am currently running the exit policy pasted below on my exit node:
ExitPolicy accept *:20-23       # FTP,SSH,TELNET
ExitPolicy accept *:53          # DNS
ExitPolicy accept *:80-82       # HTTP
ExitPolicy accept *:110-119     # POP3/NNTP
ExitPolicy accept *:143         # IMAP
ExitPolicy accept *:443         # HTTPS
ExitPolicy accept *:465         # MAIL
ExitPolicy accept *:587         # MAIL
ExitPolicy accept *:993         # IMAPS
ExitPolicy accept *:1194        # OPENVPN
ExitPolicy accept *:1720        # H.323
ExitPolicy accept *:1731        # Netmeeting Audio Control
ExitPolicy accept *:5050-5061   # YAHOO MESSENGER, SIP
ExitPolicy accept *:5190        # ICQ
ExitPolicy accept *:5222-5223   # JABBER
ExitPolicy accept *:3128        # Proxy
ExitPolicy accept *:8080        # Proxy
ExitPolicy reject *:*           # Disallow everything else
I think most needed protocols are included but I got my copyright
infringements down to zero.
Maybe redefining your policy would anticipate further problems with your
provider but still keep your exit node quite useful to most of the users.

I beg to differ...If one really filters on content level what will be
relayed and what to block you're right. But (dis-)allowing certain
traffic via ExitPolicies is no real censorship to me. See, I don't care
what is relayed via my node on Port 80 for example, but I am just able
to keep Bittorrent traffic down with more resticted policies...which
results in much higher node speed and traffic volume left to burn for
the "not filesharing-"users.
See above. I don't think choosing more restrictive exitpolicies could be
called cencorship as even the Tor network will route the via exitpolicy
blocked requests through other nodes as long as you don't block on ip
level via iptables or something similar Tor wouldn't know about.
After all, a running Exitnode relaying on the "standard" ports like HTTP
seems to be (for me) better than a completely switched off node because
of legal troubles regarding file sharing.

I agree that there are some legal uses of BT but most of the shared
stuff is copyrighted material IMHO. Surely you can use other protocols
for illegal stuff and its perfectly ok with me to relay such traffic.
The problem with P2P via Tor is that the exit nodes' ip will show up in
the MPAA's logs and they will (automated) harrass you (or worse) your
provider with their DMCA bs. I don't really care if I have to answer
such letters over and over again but my server provider will probably
get sick in forwarding them to me and may take down the server.
Hmm, I must admit that I'm not too deep into p2p via Tor, but what I
noticed from my mrtg stats of the exit node is that running a more
restrictive exit policy gives me typical traffic flows with some spikes
and so on; reverting to the standard policy peaks out the bandwith
completely. I have no further checked what is the cause of this as it
would have involved logging traffic but I think most of it is p2p
traffic as running on the restrictive exit policy got me no further
notes from the MPAA.
Actually it is an observation I already thought about asking on the
list, maybe someone could clarify if it is really p2p traffic peaking
out the link with the open exit policy?

@_subject: Tor Exit node on Intel Atom 230 anyone? 
Hash: SHA1
I'm currently looking for a new dedicated server to run a exit node on.
There is a quite interesting offer from EUServ but it is an Intel Atom
230 platform.
Are there any experiences running Tor on that platform?
The other stats are quite nice: 1 Gig Ram, unlimited 100MBit/sec Traffic
etc. The provider told me that they have no problems with running exit
nodes in their network, they even list Tor as possible application in
their offers.
Thank you,
