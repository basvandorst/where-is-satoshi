Quite a few middleman only nodes are listed as exit nodes at:
Anyone who knows why this is, while they are middleman according to the
TOR cached-directory?
Examples (not a full list):

Thanks, I didn't see the ports because I never scrolled far enough to
the right...

@_subject: Question about torrc in Windows 
I'd like to configure Tor as a server in Win98SE. From
 I gather that I need to edit
torrc. Where is torrc? It's not in the Tor Win installation package. Is it a
file? Is it a directory? If it's a file, where can I find a sample torrc
and where do I put it?
Many thanks for your help.

Thanks Marco and all for the suggestions. I never thought about looking
in drive C: since I routinely install applications on another drive. Tor
isn't on C: either.
I found torrc in C:\Windows\Application Data\Tor
I've got the server running now.

@_subject: Question about torrc in Windows 
On Sat, 26 Mar 2005 08:36:36 -0500, "Roger Dingledine" I've been using Tor in client mode since V 0.0.9. I upgraded to each
next version. When I upgraded, I unchecked the "install shortcuts"
option in the installer box, since I already had a shortcut of the
previous version in my Start menu. I also tend to clean up my Start menu. Somewhere along the way I must
have removed the shortcut to torrc from the Start menu. I never needed
to access torrc in client mode anyway.
As a windows user, I would expect that the configuration could be
changed in a Configuration menu that can be opened from within the
application. This would be the ideal situation. However, I know that Tor
doesn't have a GUI.

@_subject: Limit number of TCP connections? 
Is there a way to limit the number of connections in middleman server
mode? I typically show around 80 TCP connections to/from Tor. Then, when
I try to access the internet (not using Tor), I get a Windows error box
saying "Connection closed by remote server". I take it that this is due
to the large number of TCP connections?
I already lowered my BandwidthRate.
Win 98SE

Sorry for the double posts.
I just tried to start Privoxy (Tor was running as server for some time)
and it wouldn't start. I got the following error message:
"Fatal Error: Can't bind to 127.0.0.1:8118 because WSAENOBUFS. No buffer
space available."
According to:
...WSAENOBUFS means: "No buffer space available. An operation on a
socket could not be performed because the system lacked sufficient
buffer space or because a queue was full."
I already changed this registry setting:
changed: MaxConnections=100 to 256
This doesn't help. Win 98SE

Hi Roger and all,
Thanks for the suggestions. In the meantime, I also found some clues
about the WSAENOBUFS problem in the Todo page at:
 .
I've tweaked the MaxConnections and TcpTimedWaitDelay registry entries.
The MaxUserPort entry is not valid in the Win 98 registry, according to
my information.
