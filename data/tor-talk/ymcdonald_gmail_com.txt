@_subject: Weird behavior of my server 
I was able to install a tor server in a Ubuntu VMWare player, and
experienced the same problem you're having with the "Cannot bind to port
Here is the reason why :
10. If your computer isn't running a webserver, please consider changing
your ORPort to 443 and your DirPort to 80. Many Tor users are stuck behind
firewalls that only let them browse the web, and this change will let them
reach your Tor server. Win32 servers can simply change their ORPort and
DirPort directly in their torrc and restart Tor. OS X or Unix servers can't
bind directly to these ports (since they don't run as root), so they will
need to set up some sort of port
connections can reach their Tor server. If you are using ports 80 and
already but still want to help out, other useful ports are 22, 110, and 143.
Here are the commands to run in a terminal to enable the right port
forwarding :using sudo
Forward port 443 to 9090
iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 443 -j DNAT --to
iptables -A OUTPUT -t nat -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to $IP:9090
Forward port 80 to 9091
iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW --dport 80 -i eth0 -j ACCEPT
After issuing these commands, start you tor server, and it should work.
I am a beginner with linux as well, i found out these commands by
experiencing all sort of things, they work for me, except that my dirport is
not visible, and i don't know why !
