@_subject: Tor: Scroogle blocked, Google not ? (November 2009) 
The past few days I've noticed that all http requests to
 have invariably failed. This appeared as a
DNS failure. After switching over to the regular http (non-ssl)
version of scroogle, I found that was generally working for another
couple of days then that went away too with the same can't resolve
host / No such domain. Anyone else also experienced this?
And google. Nearly as strange have been my experience google lately.
The reason I started using Scroogle a while back was simply because
google had been blocking Tor exit nodes from performing searches. But
just today my first 2 searches worked. By prior experience this is
very uncommon. The first search had accepted cookies, the second
search cookies were disabled and it still worked just fine. Maybe
simply a coincidence and/or blind luck? Again, can anyone confirm /

@_subject: Tor Extension possible for Safari, others ? 
With the recently released of Safari 5, its now possible to write
extensions in HTML / CSS. It would be nice to know whether the browser
API exposed by Apple is capable of allowing / exposing the Browser
requests to a Socks Proxy (for Tor). Ie like FoxyProxy, TorButton etc
does for Firefox. Similarly, it would be nice to know if Chrome or
other browsers may be capable of this?
