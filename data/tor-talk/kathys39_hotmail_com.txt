@_subject: tor servers on local lan 
I am new at OR, so please be patient. I am trying to run Tor on a local lan, not connected to the Internet. I have one Authoritative Directory Server and   three "other" servers. They are on linux machines (fc4), running Each machine has the same torrc (with the exception of items marked below).  There are no firewalls running, and I have hupped each server many, many times. I cannot get a circuit going - I get the error messages "Port 80 not handled" and "0 clean circs".  A few questions - first, is it good practice to have a differnt ORPort and DirPort for each server or should they all be the same?  TIA for any help
