@_subject: Tor server using Vista? 
Anonymity systems like Tor are designed to be resistant to bad nodes,
even when the operator of the node is a bad guy.  Working on this
premise, how can the security weakness of Windows be sufficient
justification for not running a Tor node on it?  Certainly some degree
of caution and careful monitoring would be advisable but this holds true
when opening any public service.
Running a Tor server on Vista seems like a very good idea, if only to
provide the developers with feedback on how well it works.

@_subject: Tor uses swap? 
Same solution as I use but with slightly different options.  Mine are:
The example on
suggests no options other than 'swap'.
I wonder if these are differences that make a difference.  :)

Hi Mike,
I'm seeing the same crash here on a Windows 7 x64 desktop.  Downloaded
the package to the Desktop of an Admin user.  Ran the extract with no
issues and then tried running it.  Following error occurred.

Going into FirefoxPortable/App/Firefox subdir and running firefox.exe
produces the exact same crash report.  Clicking "Run as Administrator"
makes no difference.
No Firewall or IDS software is installed.
No other instance of Tor running locally.
Windows version 7 Home Premium v6.1 (Build 7601 SP1)
