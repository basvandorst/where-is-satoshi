@_subject: [tor-talk] German Laywer Sasse & Partner call to order / German 
Dear Tor Community,
I have newly subscribed to this Mailinglist cause I have been running a Tor
Exit Node in Germany. End of December 2013 I got an "Abmahnung" from a lawyer
"Sasse & Partner from Hamburg Germany" they called me to make a film public
called "Expandables 2 - Backk for War" they
imply me to share this in Torrent Netwrok with BitComet 1.36. I never used
this Bittorrent Client even  Bittorrent itself! I know that I blocked
Bittorrent by my IPTables firewall, but their might be traffic from the
bittorrent Network passed thorugh my Tor Exit Gate.
The Company Guardaley Ltd. gathered the Data and my IP-Address and the
County Court of Cologne Germany gave them my Addresse and Personal
I do not know how they get my IP-Address and I doubt that they read the
traffic from my IP-Address accuratly, cause Bittorrent Clients publish
their own IP-Address in the Bittorrent Protocoll, that is unequal the
IP-Address where the traffic may be come from.
I need arguments for the Answer to the Laywer and need some support from
the Tor Community. Cause I am and feel not guilty! I haven't done something
wrong in my view, but I am the owner of my Internet Accesspoint and in
Germany I am personally responsible for any abuses which causes from my
Internet Access!
I do not have an Open Wifi! I have WPA2 Encryption only with a 32 Character
You can write me in German as you whish!
I would be very thankful if someone could give me a good word :)
You do me a big favour thanks in advance!

Hey Leo,
thank you very much! I already read that Templates, but there is nothing
about P2P Traffic.
I already tried to setup a letter for the lawyer which has corresponding
information about the Tor Exit Node. But I am not really concerned about
telling him that Information!!! He is in the offending Position, I do not
know if it is a good Idea to tell him too much about my activity! He finds
a way to get me down.
I am currently thinking about, telling him that the Guardly Ltd. did a big
misstake in sorting my IP-Adress out of their traffic. I also told them
that P2P is only working when yourself is offering Upload and Download at
the same time. If you want an IPAdress of an Torrent Client you have to
download the File yourself and then you offer the first bit you downloaded
by yourself and they are also guilty by detecting others, they support the
sharing of files by their work. No one can proof this, but they also could
not 100% proof my guilty alone with the IP-Adress and some Data they
captured. ^^
Also my Tor Exit Node only allows 10 MB in one session, so the P2P user get
cut off after 10 MB and is relayd to another Exit node. I never could offer
the whole File transfare about my own one node tor exit.
Can someone proof my way of arguments.
thank you

Hello Manu,
Thank you!
The Exit Policy was my fault, there was accept *:* this is truly bad.
I corrected this exit-policy already to the only allowing Ports *:22, *:80,
*:81, *:82, *:443, *:8080 and reject the rest.
But in the time of the P2P Lawsuit the policy was unset.

You can not delete them. But you can disable them.
This is quiet like you don't know someone = deleted certificate
Or Your know the Authority but you do not trust them = disabled Authority.
There are two different approaches for chrome, opera, internet exploiter
use Windows Certificate storage. The Firefox Browser uses its own cert
Try to disable any authority and you will be fine.

Create an Exit Node on your Own IP Adresse. Now any Traffic that is
produced on your IP could be done from anyone else. So this could be the
best case for you. You surf over the IP of an Tor Exit no latency no
Traffic lost!

Yes you all right. This is what I thought that you all are already knowing
that! When I run a Tor Exit your IP will be blocked from Tor Unfriendly
sites after few days! If you change your IP it will take a few hours until
your new IP is blocked!
And yes the Traffic of you and other Tor users might be distinguished by
3rd party analysis. So don't feel safe! Running a Tor Exit might bring you
more trouble than just using it.
It's much easier to get a VPN with Bitcoins or Paysafe.
And forget the idea with the Exit it's just a stupid idea that comes to my
mind ;-)
