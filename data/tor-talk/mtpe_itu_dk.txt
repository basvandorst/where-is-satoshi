@_subject: [tor-talk] TOR network topology 
Hi all,
I am a student writing my master's thesis. I am, among other things, analyzing the degree of anonymity in a network and would like to investigate real life examples of TOR networks.
However, all I could find is  which can tell me about the number of relays in the network.
I am writing to you to ask, if there exist some data on the shape of the network, perhaps based by country?
I am not concerned about the practical stuff, such as IP addresses, version numbers, etc. Only what nodes in the network graph is connected to one another.
It does not matter if it is old data.
I hope you can help me out.
