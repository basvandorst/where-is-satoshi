Please do not throw the baby out with the bath water. There may be
sock puppets posting on this list, but Nick Farr is not one. Friends
of mine who attend the CCC gatherings have missed him dearly in recent
years and are shocked to learn the (main) reason for his absence now.
Greetings from Bielefeld, Germany!

Hi Lara,
Please note that it was somebody calling themselves "jacob appelbaum (ioerror) questions" who posted Nick Farr's Medium piece on this list.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tips of using Google over Tor 
Thanks for your useful advice. One minor correction is in order:
Quote from     StartPage ( is a privacy focused search engine,
    founded in New York and launched on the Web in 1998.
    Startpage.com/Ixquick.com is owned by Surfboard Holding BV, a
    privately owned Dutch company.
And from     Q: Where are StartPage's servers located?
    StartPage has server clusters in the Netherlands, Singapore and
    the United States. StartPage typically routes European searches to
    the European servers, American searches to the U.S. servers, and
    searches from other countries to the closest location. On the rare
    occasion that there is a problem in one facility, searches can
    briefly be handled by one of the other facilities.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fwd: Android Crypto Chat Apps - over Tor? 
Hi Roman,
hi Tor fans,
This is the question. I am just an observer of this scam, but maybe I
can shed some light on it.
A friend of mine who reads the “Cryptography” mailing list forwarded
this e-mail to me on July 3 – as a recommendation I should check out:
When she did this, she had not yet read grampamp's response to it:
When I looked at Smoke's Sourceforge site on the same day, the
download area for binaries and source code contained no files at all –
only empty directories. Today I can see links to GitHub repos. The
source code names Alexis Megas as the sole author, e.g. here:
Alexis Megas also seems to be associated with the suspicious GoldBug
software, as grarpamp found out:
So I do not think it is a coincidence that Smoke and Goldbug score so
many points on Smoke's “scorecard” – the evaluation is rigged in their
favor. Even those claims on that table that can be checked
independently are often false. As Roman mentioned, Telegram's client
is open source, and I can add that Conversations does not cost a dime
if you download the binary via F-Droid.
The reason why I called GoldBug suspicious is that I looked at the
“audit” you can still find on GoldBug's website in English and German
as well as in WikiBooks (which has poor quality control):
Grarpamp pointed out that the two people named as authors seem to
never have published anything else. I doubt they even exist.
I like this diagram: This is obviously neither a scientific study nor a security audit nor
a fair comparison, but somehow, not enough people noticed or
complained about it. Too many distractions these days, I guess.

Hi Muppet96,
I can highly recommend mailbox.org. They are reachable via an Onion service:
However, it's a paid service. You can use BitCoin or send bank notes:
They support encrypted storage and have a great privacy policy
and transparency reports. I agree with Scfith's advice to use
GnuPG for end-to-end encryption.

Hi Felix,
hi Tor fans,
It's too early to celebrate. This court decision applies to space.net
only. If the German government does not move, data retention will
become mandatory from 1 July nevertheless. That is why Digitalcourage
and other NGOs and grassroots organizations continue to call for a
demonstration in front of the Bundestag on Thu., 29 June, 11:55 am:

@_subject: [tor-talk] Big spike in NL-initiated Tor conns between 30 Jul & 
Hi Matthijs,
hi all,
Dont't forget legislation. In Germany, mandatory telecommunications
data retention on ISP level came into effect (for a second time) on
1 July 2017: As a counter-measure, NGOs such as my own have recommended using Tor.
Of course, this is just one possible explanation.
