@_subject: [tor-talk] Help setting up tor dos defense 
Hello I run a forum hidden service and a former user is constantly
attacking it.
I now have 0.4.2.5 installed and this is my torrc file the attacks still
persist do I need to add anything else or change these numbers I thought
this version of tor fixed these attacks was I mistaken?
