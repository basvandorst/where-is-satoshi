@_subject: [tor-talk] Shutting down my tor relay 
I can understand your anger and frustration very well and consider myself, what community I joined. A long and certainly extensively researched article in the German weekly “Zeit” which I personally appreciate, ends with the following sentences: Many others interviewed for this article, both friends and opponents of Mr. Appelbaum, didn’t want to be quoted. Out of fear of reprisals, both sides say.
Nevertheless, I have decided to hold to the project with several exits, because I am more concerned with the user and not the people of the project, from whom I expect  a lot more transparency. In Germany we have a presumption of innocence- this should be applied here as well and so I have to admit, I am disappointed with the premature decision of the CCC in Germany.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Censorship on this list 
I know of someone who believes there is a censorship on this list.
So could the moderator of the list please answer whether this is the case?
If so, what are the rules for it apart from a bad stomach feeling?
If there are - where are they published please?
Best regards

"has opted not to accept" - interesting, but maybe a lost chance to bring more light and transparency to all of us who support the project in one way or the other :-(
I would like to learn and understand how such an "opt" process is talking place, who is doing it, on what knowledge, etc...?
I will be there as well and more than happy to meet others running Exits or not!
Regards Paul
