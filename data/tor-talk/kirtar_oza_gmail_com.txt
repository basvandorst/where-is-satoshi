@_subject: [tor-talk] Fwd: torrc does not have content : Issue in setting up 
I am trying to setup hidden service using TOR.. I am following the method
given on TOR website by modifying the torrc file. However, my torrc file
dose not contain the content. The couple of lines torrc is having is as
the other file I have in the same folder is torrc-defaults, it also does
not have content as shown in the sample torrc file. Whe I tried to add
couple of lines for hidden services at the end of torrc-default file, TOR
stops working.
I added following lines with the changed username
HiddenServiceDir C:\Users\username\Documents\tor\hidden_service
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:8080
Please help
