@_subject: [tor-talk] Orbot 
Nice to be here.
I?am working on a Android project.
I try to launch tor (Orbot 12.05 already installed )  via the console/terminal
I don?t want the graphical interface so ?users? can mess with it.
(orbot is working perfect via the gui)
Does anyone have the exact syntax to start on a nexu Phones?
I want to start is from an shell script and checked by crond
i have access to the phone and crond is running.. But i can?t get the tor client working correctly
I have a problem starting the client correct.
Hope someone has more info  for me.
