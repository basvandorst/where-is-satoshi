@_subject: Is there something similar like "Torbutton" FF plugin for the Internet Explorer ? 
If you're using Privoxy, it has such a function build in already. Just go to the special 'website' p.p which will be intercepted by privoxy and you can click on 'Toggle Privoxy on or off'. There you can switch it off and it also offers bookmarklets, which you can add as buttons (bookmarks) to your IE. Easy as that.

@_subject: Warning Message 
That is the wrong interface. 127.0.0.1 is the local interface that allows your computer to talk to itself. You have to open the port on the external interface. Find an interface with an IP other than 127.0.0.1.

@_subject: Stable in noreply debian repo jumped to 0.2.0.30 
I have installed tor from the noreply.org debian repository for etch. Aptitude now wants to upgrade from my stable 0.1.2.19 to 0.2.0.30, for which there isn't even an announcement out yet.
Are there any problems with the repo? I assume I shouldn't do that upgrade for now.

@_subject: Practical advice regarding Beijing Olympics and Tor ? 
Hong Kong is outside the chinese firewall. There is no filtering I am aware of. The hostspots at the airport are free to use now, AFAIK.
For your other points I don't really know the answers. I have been briefly using the internet in Beijing through residential cable, but that was 2.5 years ago.
Basically if something isn't blocked then just go ahead :) It's quite the opposite of what the government tries to instill into the people but if you're a tourist you're unlikely to get into real trouble in any case. Worstcase scenario would be to get arrested and kicked out of the country. But that would require some strong political display in public.
I used ssh and openvpn back then. I had some trouble with openvpn so I tunneled it through ssh and didn't investigate any further for those few days. Maybe because I was using tcp mode... In general I hear vpns are quite painless these days. So, if you experienced problems using tor you could route it through a vpn/ssh tunnel to your computer at home or to a commercial provider. End of 2005 is was very difficult to find an internet cafe, though. That was some time after their crackdown. After a long taxi ride to an outer part of the city, probably next to a university, we found one. But 'guards' were patrolling around to ensure highest ethical conduct ;)
I wonder what the situation is like today.
Tell us upon your return should you experience something tinteresting (tor/net related).

@_subject: Reregister after key change? 
I seem to remember that, when I set up my tor node, the instructions suggested to register the node name by sending an email to somewhere. In the docs currently online I don't find this request anymore.
Anyway, since I changed my onion key because of the ssl vulnerability should I send another email somewhere?

@_subject: Reregister after key change? 
Sorry, I mixed that up but I deleted all keys, hence also the signing I haven't seen any warnings regarding my own name in the logs. I guess my 'registration' never really happend.
I noticed all (most) of my familymembers (nodes at the same colo) do have two entries and the logs also warn about this. I assume the old identities will eventually expire? Tor mentions that they are not 'named', at least some of them.

@_subject: Tor server "nami" taken by the German Police 
I'm wondering if people running on residential lines are more likely to be subjected to such things. I'm running my node inside a virtual machine on my dedicated server with its own IP address. Hence I have also set up reverse dns for the IP address. Anyone probing that IP will immediately see that it is a tor-proxy and quite likely not worth the effort. Of course everyone could just claim that, but it is quick and easy to verify that.
For residential IPs it is not possible to distinguish a tor node from a person. Only recently I was thinking that German police probably learned from their first raid. Now this is coming along, but again, they couldn't know it was a tor node until they visited the friendly bloke. Would be interesting to know if any colo machines have been affected again after the 2007 incident.
