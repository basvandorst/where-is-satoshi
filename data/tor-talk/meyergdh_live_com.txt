@_subject: [tor-talk] Meek bridges request 
I've been testing the Tor Browser Bundle with meek, and it worked fine (really, it's actually the only way to bypass a proxy system in a place that I am every day), because it supports the use of HTTP/S proxy. But, here (in Brazil) at least, we're experiencing a too slow connection with the default meek's bridge  (when the Tor had worked normally, it was so fast). If anyone have a faster meek bridge, please share, we here are needing of one! (sorry for my bad english)

Thanks for making the speed question clearer for me! So, the people here are using the ProxFree web-proxy, but it's so wide-spread on the place that we need to bypass the proxy, and soon it'll be blocked. I think that Tor is more secure than that based web-proxies, so I'll stop from suggesting web-proxies and make a real solution, with Tor. We'll be using the tor meek bundle soon here.
P.S.: Do you know any manner to make obfsproxy and/or fte work with an HTTP proxy?

Unfortunately, it don't work. When I try to connect, it says: "missing pluggable transport". fteproxy don't show anything, it don't work. But thanks anyway, I'll try some other solutions here, thanks!

I can't wait for the next Tor version, so I need a solution. I tried inserting the txsocksx files into the obfsproxy.zip: I got a advance: It doesn't throws up any error, but it stays in "Estabilishing an encrypted...". Do I forgot something?
