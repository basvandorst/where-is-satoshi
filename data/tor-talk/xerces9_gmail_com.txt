@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB 3.5 - lot of Unable to connect errors 
Since I updated to tor browser bunde 3.5 (was using 2.3.x before) I
get a lot of error like this:
Unable to connect
Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at This happens when opening the page, with no delay, so it is not a
timeout problem.
Maybe it is related to the fact that I open multiple links in tabs by
middle clicking the URLs.
Retrying the pages usually loads them with no problem. (clicking the
"Try Again" button).

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB download mirror or p2p? 
The TBB download
is quite slow, getting about 100KB/s (much faster line...).
Is this a temporarily (over)load of the server?
Otherwise, did you consider solutions like mirrors (ancient technology
;) ) or p2p distribution (bittorrent or other) ?

Aha, tanks.
They are not mentioned on the Tor Browser Bundle page :

@_subject: [tor-talk] Suddenly dead exit node? 
I experienced quite a few times that after successful browsing (using
the tor-browser bundle) suddenly no connections can be made. Then I
click the "Use a new Identity" button and then everything works again.
Is this due to an exit node becoming unavailable? If yes, could this
be detected and automatically switched to another one?
If no, what could be the cause?
PS: Using tor-browser-2.3.25-8_en-US on Windows 8.

I use tor-browser-2.3.25-8_en-US on Windows 8.
I pinned the "Start Tor Browser.exe" file to the task bar, for easy start.
When it is started by clicking it, the actual running instance creates
another icon on the task bar, so a t the en there are:
 - originally pinned onion icon
 - another onion for the running Vidalia Control Panel window
 - the browsers icon (green globe)
Is there a way to "unite" at least the onion icons? To reduce clutter?

As the to browser (I have tor-browser-2.3.25-4_en-US) has the history
set to "Never remember history", the "Show cookies" button is hidden.
But the tor browser does remember cookies (otherwise many websites
would be unusable, I guess this some tor patch to the original
So the user is left without the control over cookies.
Is there hope for a small patch to enable the Cookies dialog?
There is currently a workaround: select "Remember history" (this
brings back the "show cookies" function), edit cookies, set histoy
back to "Never remember history".

I use TBB 3.5.1 (win32)
Trying to delete some specific cookies, in the preferences I selected
"Remember History" on the "Privacy" tabs, to gain access to the "Show
cookies" button.
Unexpectedly that required a restart of TBB.
As that wiped out all cookies anyway, I tired to set thing back as they were.
But if I select "Never remember history", after confirming it (click
OK), it changes to "Use custom settings for history". I tried several

The third one is not checked.
When I select "Never remember history", it does not prompt for restart.
If I restart manually, the setting is reverted to "Use custom settings
for history".
if I set the mentioned third option in TorButton Security prefs, then
set "Never remember history", restart (it does not prompt), the
TorButton Security change is preserved, but the History setting again
reverts to "Use custom settings for history".

I now tried a clean installation of TBB 3.5.1 win32
I change the option from "Never remember history" to "Remember History".
It requested a restart.
Then I checked and it was "Use custom settings for history".
I looked at the TorButton extension security tab settings and it had
the first and third option UNchecked.
I changed it to "Never remember history", it requested a restart again.
I looked at the TorButton extension security tab settings and it had
the third option UNchecked.
Then I checked the FF prefs and it was again "Use custom settings for history".
So it is easily reproducible.
Release the developers! ;-)

I'm still using tor-browser-2.3.25-15 because of this.

Additional info:
 - I am on 3.5.1 now and have the same issues
 - it seems thing work fine if I use the default torrc file
What I change is to add about 20 MapAddress lines to block ad servers.
I use the same list on 2.3.25 and there it causes no problems.

Lately (like last 10 days) I see many messages (more than usual) on

The reason given is most often:
 - (this message) It has a from address in foo.com but has failed
foo.com's required tests for authentication.
 - It's similar to messages that have been detected by our spam filters.
Is it just "a nothing" or is something going on?
