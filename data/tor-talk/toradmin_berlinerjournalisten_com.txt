Yes, I know, it is more secure to install the remailer software on your
computer, but sometimes a web interface is an useful solution.

this exit-node problem you may have with Google and some DNSBL (SORBS
and others?) too. Your exit node contacts several IRC channels. That is
why your node is listed as "trojan hacked".
Some times ago we have a thread about SORBS and many exit nodes were
listed in this DNSBL with the attribut "trojan hacked". Conclusion of
the thread was: "They have no glue!"
Google sometimes does not work with several exit nodes and give you the
message "You may have a virus or malware, please clean your computer!"
(or something like that).
I have changed the exit policity of my node and now it is no longer
listed in SORBS and works fine with Google. May be, this is not a good
solution. Any other suggestions?

supporting spammers
The SSL-encrypted SMTP-ports are using SMTP-Auth (mostly). The
support of spammer is very low (in my opinion).
By the way, I have the same problems like you since Nov.2006
(trouble with the german BKA because of childporn, trouble with my
ISP). Half a year ago I switched to middleman but it did not help. I
run into a telecommunication surveillance and became a terrorist or
something like that.
You have read the Heise-News about bad exit nodes (controlled
governments and others):
I think, a middleman node is not a solution for our problems. May
be, we are listed in a database and the listing is not deleted after
switching to middleman. May be, a bad exit feature out the next
My recommendation: Try to find a strong, TOR-friendly organisation
for your nodes. You manage the nodes and the organisation takes the
liability (jurisitische Verantwortung).

@_subject: Like to run TOR-Node 
I tried to run a tor node on a Strato vserver 1 year ago.
It did not work, because the max. connections were limited to 145
TCP-connection IN and 145 TCP-connections OUT. A TOR server needs at
least 1024 connections. See:
The ISP "1blu" offers a vserver, which may be used for a TOR node.
I read a message about a running TOR node without any error on a 1blu
vserver. It offers more traffic ;-)
Viel Erfolg!

It is accepted by Mozilla browsers by default.
Your proxy may became a nice service for some users.

You may generate your own server request certificate on a Linux/Unix
system with OpenSSL. They will sign your request (ssl.csr), your privat
key (ssl.key) does not leave your computer.
  # openssl genrsa -des3 -out ssl.key 1024
  # openssl req -new -key ssl.key -out ssl.csr
Use the wizzard "without CSR generation":
Is this way ok for you?

No problem! The Intermediate CA certificates may be integrated in your
apache configuration (or lighttpd or ....). Small example for apache2:
    # SSL configuration
    SSLEngine On
    SSLCipherSuite HIGH
    SSLCertificateFile      /.../ssl.crt       # your public cert
    SSLCertificateKeyFile   /.../sss.key       # your private key
    SSLCertificateChainFile   /.../sub.ca.crt  # update on 24th Dec!
    SSLCACertificateFile     /.../ca.crt       # CA root cert
 ....
The CA Root Certificate is not changed and this one is trusted by
Mozilla by default. If the admin of the server does a good job and
update the certificates on 24th of December, the hole certification
chain may be verified in future too.
The Intermediate CA certificates have not to be integrated in the
clients, if the server admin has done a good job. (But I know, not all
server admins have the hole certification chain in the configuration.)
I think, Mozilla becames an update too and so all configurations will
work in future.

Hello german guys,
Der Druck erh?ht sich:
"wormhole" ist bereits offline und braucht evtl. Hilfe, "knuffel" ist
unter neuem Namen wieder online, jetzt "morphium".
Als mein Server vor 8 Wochen offline ging habe ich erfahren, dass der
Republikanische Anwaltsverein Hilfe anbieten k?nnte. Der CCC arbeitet
mit ihm zusammen, um seine beiden TOR-Server am laufen zu halten.
Kontakt per IRC ist da aber kaum m?glich. Ich w?rde Constanze Kurz vom
CCC ansprechen. Sie k?nnte einen Kontakt zu den Anw?lten herstellen.
Es wird Zeit, eine Organisation f?r TOR-Admins zu bilden, an die man
sich wenden kann. Wir br?uchten Anw?lte, Journalisten ....
