You need to install the sniffers CA certificate to allow them to break your
TLS connections or you need to hack a trusted CA to create some wildcard
ones (Comodo incident). Some software like Chrome also uses cert pinning,
so only a hardcoded cert is allowed. Afaik Tor uses hardcoded certs for the
dir authority and relay certs are signed by dir authority, so this
technology wouldn't be able to sniff Tor traffic, even if you voluntarly
install their CA on your machine.

How likely is it the law enforcement just wiretapped guard nodes in
their political range and raided the IPs which had most traffic and
weren't Tor relays? This would explain why only servers located in US
colonies got seized. No fancy security vulnerability involved, just
simple police state tactics.
I personaly know a case where the German Gestapo got a court order to do
DPI at German ISPs to find the IP used to login to a Russian messenger
service, ofc there was no terrorism, murder, drugs or child abuse
involved in that case. So if their courts allow nation wide DPI to
locate a single person only involved in minor crimes, wiretapping a few
dozen guard nodes seems totally plausible.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Making Apache server talk to the Tor network? 
You probably want your apache to download files from hidden service or web
via exit nodes transparently. I advice you to create a virtual machine for
the apache server, which has a network interface shared with the host.
For the apache vm use 10.192.0.10/255.255.0.0 with 10.192.0.1 as a gateway
and dns.
On the hosts vm-shared interface use 10.192.0.1/255.255.0.0  without
gateway or dns.
Now install tor on the host and add following to torrc:
DNSPort 0.0.0.0:9053 VirtualAddrNetworkIPv4 10.192.0.0/16
AutomapHostsOnResolve 1
TransPort 9040
Now you need some iptables on the host:
 all dns packets to our tor-dns-port, udp is stateless, so no NAT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i myvlan0 -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT
--to-ports 9053
 input on myvlan0:9040
iptables -A INPUT -i myvlan0 -p tcp --dport 9040 -j ACCEPT
 all tcp connections coming from the vm to port 9040
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i myvlan0 -p tcp --syn -j REDIRECT
--to-ports 9040
Now your vm will communicate with the internet only via Tor, without
knowing about it, so in case of a compromise the apache vm won't disclose
your servers IP. You can now add a hidden service to the hosts torrc
redirecting from
asdfghj.onion:80 to 10.192.0.10:80.
This is a setup used in dark markets which are still successfully
operating. You shouldn't use apache though.
A bad practice would be to install torsocks and start apache with
torsocks apache -c someconfig --otherparams
This will leak IPs left and right, wont allow onion domains and in case of
a compromise your IP is disclosed.

"We will help collecting metadata to punish opsec failures of Tor users,
since the data is public anyway. Also if we don't do it, someone else will."
Judging by comments on technews sites, it's highly paradox that
Torproject wants to develop a data retention and indexing service for a
domain which aims to be hidden by the very name.
It's like you would advise against regulating NSA, instead all we should
just encrypt everything. Weren't you Tor guys full SJW and against
victim blaming?
I for one wouldn't trust an anonymization tool, which couldn't protect
child porn users, more than the common $5 hidemycrime VPN service.
Is Tor reasonably safe for a crime not only ostracised by LE but the
entire general public? If so, why even bother licking the LE boot and
trying to stop it?
If not, why should Tor ever be used by whistleblowers?
Will the Torproject sign a NDA while working on Memex? Will this stop
you from publishing problems arising from mass data aggregation, not
directly related to Tor itself? "We noticed LE can use content creation
time, if availbable over a prolonged period, to correlate Tor-Guard
metadata from internet mass surveilance to narrow down suspects for
reasonable search, but we can't talk about it because they really need

The common user does not apply to all threat models. If you are a high
volume recreational drug salesman, you must expect 0days and snitches.
If you however are merely a recreational drug consumer, Tor can cover
all of your security risks, because only low cost automated
investigation will be used against you. Traffic correlation and mass
surveilance are part of the NSA and will be applied to all kinds of
investigations once the fruit of the poisonous tree can be eaten.
Anonymization networks will be a substantial part of escaping
govermental terrorism if we won't be able to politicaly supress mass
surveilance and atm it very much appears we won't.
There are many ways to implement better anoynmity than Tor at a useful
scale, if low latency is sacrificed. Decentralized non-realtime network
protocols (maelstrom, bitmessage) are already beeing developed and might
work great for buying recreational drugs and watching censored adult
porn (which honestly is 90% of Tor's current userbase anyway)

Outgoing traffic stats from Tor exit nodes. Almost all traffic of

China is" is a lie, almost all of them just want to wank.
Tell me one hidden service which needs anonymity, has more than 100
users and is not a drug market place or furry porn community for
computer science PhDs.
Don't get me wrong, Tor is a beautiful and necessary tool for people to
ignore their goverments regulation on what to put in their bodies and
what to watch, but it really isn't what the liberal hivemind wants to

evilguys.com:9050, which does ssl interception with that installed ssl
cert. At the time of leak only browsers on mac and internet explorer on
windows were supported, because they used registry keys to change proxy
Their attack currently doesn't work on TBB, not because it's securer,
but because Hacking Team is incapable to program proper
pre-encryption-interception on the victim machine. If your computer is
infected ALL your traffic CAN be intercepted by definition, it just
takes some *able* malware developers to implement it.

Fact 1: Hacking Team could only infect a simple BIOS firmware of some

Fact 2: You can always replace the Tails boot medium with your

Fact 3: You could always have an 0day in Tails' software and somehow get
around the sandbox to extract information from the currently running Tails.
Fact 4: Browser-exploiting an OS which routes only via Tor is almost
impossible, you would need to MITM the currently used exit node and
correctly identify the HTTP session or hack a server the target frequents.
Hacking Team didn't design anything new, all of their "sophisticated
infection vectors" are basic shit. Just carry your Tails medium with you
all the time and you are immune to those amateur "hackers".
I honestly hope Hacking Team gets to sign their own UEFI bootloader with
a valid certificate. Ofc it will leak someday and have a lot of bugs,
which can be used to side boot your own unsigned UEFI code. Then we can
finally throw all that trusted boot bullshit into the trash it belongs.

If you are a boring common man, your set of "things banned in my
country" and "things I want" is pretty small, in fact it will only
contain adult pornography, download of copyrighted media and social media.
Let's take a look at copyrighted media, atm the most common blocking
technique is blocking the IP of the torrent tracker, circumvented by
downloading the .torrent file from somewhere else or using DHT.
Social media consumes less traffic and is only blocked in countries with
limited mass surveilance expertise, Five-Eyes countries have no need to
block social media as they are thoughtfully monitoring it.
You are left with streaming porn which somehow was deemed "unsafe" in
your country.
You can't assume onion service lookups mirror the usage of Tor, noone
hosts adult porn on onion services, noone hosts warez on onion services
and until recently noone hosted social media on onion services.
You need to slip in the role of the common internet user, the type of
internet user who needs it solely for consuming. He doesn't want to

had injected 32 and 64bit drivers into a running windows, they were
intel chipset drivers. Many mainboards and notebooks do that. Some of
them use documentated UEFI features where windows searches for those
blocks in memory, verifies signature and loads them. Other patch the
windows kernel on the fly via interrupt vector hooks like a bootkit.
ARM CPUs are more fragmented, everyone can rent their blueprints and
print their own CPUs, backdoors are less likely than from a single
Use a x86/64 mainboard without EFI or an ARM embedded board. Also don't
forget to epoxy your PCI slots, it's possible to execute unverified code
at boot and at runtime by sticking something in your PCI.
Another advice: Add some notification to your setup for hardware changes
of any kind. In /etc/udev/rules.d/ you can define what to do if certain
hardware is inserted or detached, it even works for kernel modules and
ethernet. You can define a rule for all changes and make it email you a
PGP encrypted kernel log. If someone inserts a new USB device you get
notified. If someone replugs the ethernet cable at the server you get
notified. If malware somehow loads a kernel module you get notified.
Spies hate that!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Multiple IP's 
You could start multiple Tor instances on different ports (9050, 9051,
9052...) with their own torrc file limiting to only 1 exit. That way you
will get the same multiple IPs every time. Your game must support SOCKS
proxies though (if it isn't a browser game).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Making TBB undetectable! 
Can't TBB devs just patch in a hardcoded 1366x768 window and screen size
in the javascript handler?
Also, if you want true undetectability you need to install a Tor
instance and your OS for TBB in seperate VMs and setup the Tor VM to be
a transparent router for your OS, so even if java/flash/exploit is
executed, it doesn't leak your real IP, since even your OS in the VM is
forced through Tor.
The FBI used an old firefox exploit to execute native code and did plain
IP requests to uncover users. In that configuration they would need an
additional VM escape exploit, which raises the cost exponentially.

Configure your message board software so all posts from Tor exit nodes
IPs need to be moderator approved. It takes seconds per post for a mod
to check and minutes for a malicious individual to post.
If your message board software doesn't support this, just block all Tor
exit nodes IPs for a week or so until the malicious individual gets bored.

@_subject: [tor-talk] New methods / research to detect add-ons? 
Every add-on installed/not installed gives you one more bit of detection.
For example to detect HTTPS-Everywhere you start a http connection via
javascript and check if it gets automaticly upgraded to https. To detect
Adblock you check via javascript if a certain ad got loaded. To detect
Scriptblock you check if javascript got executed at all.The three
examples above give you 3 more bits, so your detection got 8 times more
If the NSA now records you visiting an internet forum via TBB and
leaking something and detect another visitor with the same 3 bits set
looking for a train scheduele, they can verify with a high confidence
you posted that message and live in that area.
That's why it's important that every TBB installation has the same
Http-Header values and same add-ons.
You don't need any studies, it's simple common knowledge.

No, unless the ISP blocks all communication except HTTP to their

though bridges are a little tricky.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Operation Onymous Technical Explanation? 
CANNON NATHANIEL CIOTA:
A protocol flaw allowed Guard-node and Exit-node (or that thing that
does rendezvous, forgot the name) to talk to each other over a "hidden
information line" on one Tor circuit. Guard-node knows the real IP,
Exit-node knows traffic + destination IP or in the case of hidden
services, the destination onion.
If both nodes were attacker-controlled, they talked to each other via
that information line, using some weird Tor control messages which were
somehow transparently transported on the whole circuit.
Torproject disabled that weird control message and included a detection,
if any Tor client notices someone still using it, it creates a log
message with the instruction to notify Torproject.

Absolutely this.
Also Facebook's intention was to give citizens of oppressive regimes a
simple way to access US controlled propaganda to fuel dissident and
destabilize the country ala Arab Spring.
Facebook also sets a cookie and every website with Facebook tracking
buttons reports the visit with the unique identifier tied to the
Facebook account. Unless ofc you block javascript, but no human being
can solve the Cloudflare captchas you get without javascript, so
disabling javascript is pretty much non-existing.

You should also check if you have multiple instances of ransomware on
your computer. If it happens to be so, the ransomwares encrypted each
other and you won't be able to recover the files, even if you pay both
ransoms. Cryptolockers are truly destructive.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Danish data retention on steroids 
Niels Elgaard Larsen:
I assume "session volume" is the size of payload data transfered in a
single TCP session.
If a Danish Tor user visited a Danish website affected and the website
used non-multiplex http (everything before http/2 and SPDY) there would
be 30 different TCP sessions for all those pictures, scripts, 3rd party
tracker elements, etc on the website. So in the data retention database
there will be a very fine grained and timestamped traffic log of this
particular site visit, useable for traffic correlation attacks. The
situation gets even worse if the website uses some periodic push/pull
system like for example a twitter feed, creating and closing TCP
connections every few seconds.
Lots of data over one single persistent TCP connection = only one entry
in data retention database = not useful for deanonymizing Tor users.
Lots of data over many short lived TCP connections over a long period of
time = many fine grained entries in data retention database = useful for
deanonymizing Tor users.
It should also be taken into account the goverment could force the ISP
to terminate TCP connections every few seconds to increase the amount of
logs created.
