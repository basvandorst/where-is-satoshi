@_subject: [tor-talk] Strange behaviour from Gmail's IP to location 
Do you know which location is correct? Geobytes shows freeside to be
in Glendora,CA with certainty 90% and when i use it as my exit node,
news.google.com shows stories for Canada.
Last month i had an exit node which ip2location put in New York, while
geobytes thought i was in Norway and gmail just couldn't tell.
None of these database are 100% right unfotunately.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Router 
In case of OpenWRT, look at And then it's mostly a matter of what the router has to offer in terms
of resources. Most of them are not powerful enough to be truly useful,
that's why the list of tested equipment is so small.
I've run Tor (only in client mode) on similar routers in the past, but
I'd recommend you get something with more juice.
People have been doing it, so it's possible if that's the system you
prefer and have some time to figure it out.
Also, OpenWRT can be flashed onto many routers without the need for ddwrt.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Blocking Tor - solutions? 
I have a related question. Is there a public archive of former exits?
Or if a person used to run an exit, but now they don't, they can't
have the "therefore not my traffic" excuse anymore?
Not due to creativity, but rather a mistake, I ran an "anonymous" exit
briefly, when the advertised address was different than outbound
