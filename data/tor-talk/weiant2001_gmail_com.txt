@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidallia Issues 
To whom it may concern:
I have been trying to configure Vidalia (on linux Mint 17) to help by
running a relay. However, I keep running into 1 of 2 problems.
I went to the sharing tab in the settings, filled out the appropriate
fields as outlined on the website, however, when I click "Ok", it
directs me back to the advanced tab and says "Vidalia was unable to
save your Advanced settings. ControlSocket path doesn't exist." The
"Use Unix domain socket" field is selected. I attempted to change it
to the "Use TCP connectio" however I get the following errors when
trying to start Tor from the vidalia gui

I downloaded vidalia from the software manager in Linux Mint. I
attempted to install the bundle from the website but couldn't get it
to take. So i installed Tor browser from the software manager also.
Your help in getting this resolved will be greatly appreciated.
