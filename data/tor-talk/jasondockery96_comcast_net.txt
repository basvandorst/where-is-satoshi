In my message log I have this error.   [Warning] ControlPort is open, but no authentication method has been configured.  This means that any program on your computer can reconfigure your Tor.  That's bad!  You should upgrade your Tor controller as soon as possible.
I have upgraded to the newest alpha and stable and still get this error.  is this normal?
