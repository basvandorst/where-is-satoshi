@_subject: [tor-talk] DogecoinDark Cryptocurrency is now fully dark using 
Please stop doing masked advertising to this mail list.
What makes a client sure that DogecoinDark software protects them against
malicious peers feeding them scrambled data? What are the protections?
Why the hell would someone use DogecoinDark anyway? Who si that dumb? Tor
community is not a suitable target for cheap scams using altcoins. Users
here are much more smarter than that.
DogecoinDark is yet another altcoin appeared like a mushroom after the
rain, with no solid background and no academic research, designed to make
someone rich over night for a thing which very well might fail (and it
will). If anyone would use a cryptocurrency, they will use Bitcoin for so
many reasons, starting with technical specification which is much better
researched and understood by academics and developers (ECDSA, SHA256) and
the enormous sum invested in mining hardware as well as electricity bill
for these machines.
P.S. Rather than naming altcoins fancy (like dogecoin, dogecoindark,
dogecoinlight, DogecoinSpicy, DogeCoinSweet, DogeCoinSalted, FeatherCoin,
whatever (source  you should name them as:
makes it easier for people to make reference to them.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden Services v2 proposal (nickm) 
For the record, regarding the new proposal to have ecc keys and longer
names (unhashed) as hidden service hostnames as opposite to SHA1, what
other changes will this proposal make to the hidden services arhitecture?
In particular I am interested if this kind of attack will be cancelled:
It's quite important for reliability and scalability. Thanks.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Propsal for decentralization of the Tor network 
I have carefully checked trac and torproject.org website for proposals,
seen many interesting ones but not a single one to decentralize the Tor
network from the direcotry authorities. There are many ways to accomplish
this apparently, and it's the only way to guarantee full independence and
Are there even plans to make this change? Or the current system which
offers full control for few people seams good enough to you?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Relay Smartphone App 
Speaking of this, let's say I run a fast relay from my home connection
(2MB/s). Can I run another relay with the same id from my mobile?
Something like 2 in 1, where I have the same id on both machines?
Or will the network reject my second one..?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Questions about crypto used in TAP/Ntor 
Dear experts,
Want to clarify some things:
1. The fignerprint of a Tor relay which is advertised in the direcotry
data is a SHA1 sum of which key? Sice now a relay has a secret onion key
and a secret key for Ntor.
2. The fingerprint (since it's a hash sum of the key) is what strengths
encryption between relays or clients and relays, kind of like a CA in SSL?
That is why the directory authorities sign the list of fingereprints - is
this correct?
3. How strong is Ntor compared to TAP? As I can see in latest Tor version
now clients prefer Ntor by default - are there any plans to deprecate TAP
in teh future?
4. The fingerprint is a SHA1 hash, as described in the papers. Any plans
to move in the immediate future to a stronger hash algorithm, like SHA256?

Dear Nick,
I want to thank you very much for your clear and explicit answer. This is
what a transaparent and open-source project is all about. Thanks to people
with your attitude such communities go forward and grow in perfomance.
Obviously you were incomparable smarter (I don't have to say it, it can be
seen from 1 million miles) than our friend who had a feeling I am from the
NSA :) To be honest, I am just comparing the crypto primitives used in Tor
to the current standards from NIST, etc. I haven't asked anything which I
shouldn't know.
I have read the proposal, sounds way better than what we currently have.
Hope it will be active as soon as possible.
Maybe you get the chance to look into the Hidden Services (I know a
proposal exists there but couldn't find it) so that they will be more
secure, scalable and DoS resitant, including protecting the Hidden Service
Again, thank you for your patience and explicit reply.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor's path security 
Please experts respond to this questions, answers will be posted on a
local blog translated:
1. Why does Tor allow to specify Guards and Exits? if you specify the
guard and exit, isn't this contrary of security and anonymity?
2. Middle nodes can't be specified in Tor's path? If No, why not, if yes
it's understandable.
3. How does Tor select a middle relay? It's totally random? How many
middle nodes will Tor use for example in 1 week of usage? They change all
the time unlike Guards?
4. Is the middle relay selection in the path process differenet when using
a Bridge than when regularly connectinh? If yes, how?
Thank you very much for your answers. Thanks Tor team for providing this
tool to the internet.

@_subject: [tor-talk] wake up tor devs 
Why is Tor wasting time in implementing secure hidden services? Why not
copy from here if they are doing it right:
Tor	I2P
Cell	Message
Client	Router or Client
Circuit	Tunnel
Directory	NetDb
Directory Server	Floodfill Router
Entry Guards	Fast Peers
Entry Node	Inproxy
Exit Node	Outproxy
Hidden Service	Eepsite or Destination
Hidden Service Descriptor	LeaseSet
Introduction point	Inbound Gateway
Node	Router
Onion Proxy	I2PTunnel Client (more or less)
Relay	Router
Rendezvous Point	somewhat like Inbound Gateway + Outbound Endpoint
Router Descriptor	RouterInfo
Server	Router
Why not distributed directory authorities and hardcoded?
Why not secure tunnels independent of guards?
Or does Tor want to remain less secure?
