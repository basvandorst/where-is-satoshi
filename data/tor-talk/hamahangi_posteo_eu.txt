In a recent crypto.is post, Tom Ritter provides a clear explanation of
the traffic correlation attack that can be performed if the adversary
can see the first and last connections. (I know this is Tor 101, but he
has nice diagrams).
If I live in freedom-loving State (B) and want to view information on a
website in censorious State (A), I'm presumably safer from attack by
State (A) if I can ensure that the entry node I connect to isn't there,
but if Tor does its job then it's of no consequence that the middle or
exit nodes might be located there.
So why is there no ExcludeEntryNodes option? It seems to have been
present at some point as there's reference to it in old mirrors of the
documentation and on the blog[0], and the helpdesk advised me that it
was still there, but I've tried it with both the stable and the alpha
TBB bundles and they both keel over on startup with 'failed to parse'
errors. Where'd it go? There are two tickets open about this but neither
has received comment.

and  There seems to have been some fiddling with both but no
comments to speak of. Thanks for clearing up the reasoning behind your
Also a web search for "ExcludeEntryNodes" brought up a preparatory
commit you seem to have made earlier this year
I would have thought that the potential importance of the feature here
described in avoiding traffic correlation would outweigh the possible
disadvantage in having it behave unexpectedly, but I can't argue with
your experience.
Would listing all country codes except the one you wanted to avoid under
'EntryNodes' do for a temporary workaround? Is there a list of these
that Tor uses, or do I have to enter them manually? (I'm not a
programmer, evidently.)
Thanks for your response.

You're right, of course. You have to program for Tor's most at-risk
user, and I'm in the privileged position of occasionally being able to
play double-or nothing with my (ano/pseudo)nymity. It's just that this
particular issue is one often levelled as an accusation by the
Tor-is-broken brigade, and anything that could scupper traffic analysis
might alleviate their concerns. In any case, I hope your checklist goes
some way towards adding this feature into a future build; I wish I could
Wicked. Clearly the next thing I have to do is learn Perl.
I hope nobody assassinates you in the near future.
