I got the Tor client working on Windows for HTTP and IRC cuz
the applications had support for SOCKS.
I saw the documentation on tsock/socat. This solution is for Unix only. I've got a couple ssh clients on windows that don't support any
kind of proxy. Is there a solution for windows apps that
do not support SOCKS to use Tor?
When the Tor server is setup, is it supose to be a Directory Server
or an Onion Router? Is the Onion Router a SOCKS proxy, a modified SOCKS proxy to support
the Tor feature set, or something completely different?

I gave SocksCap a try and works pretty well. When the target
host was on the same subnet as the machine running Tor, Tor
complained that it didn't know how to get to the destination.
I was also told that Hummingbird works real well too.

@_subject: Limiting possible last hops 
Is there a way to limit the possible set of last hops?
Like if I wanted to make sure the last hop was located
in the US.
I was using the Google toolbar, and I would get different languages
showing up which I suspect is from the country of the last hop.

@_subject: Open Proxy Monitors 
On some IRC channels, being anonymous via an open proxy will
cause "you" to get banned.  Since Tor is in large part a
SOCKS proxy, I could envision someone to extend the existing
open proxy monitors to search for ORs (or more simply download
the list of routers from the directory server) and ban those.
Once that happens, does this mean Tor will no longer be useable
to IRC? and more generally, to any other target that bans the
use of open proxies?  I don't see anything in the design that
would prevent this from happening.

@_subject: Overloading defaults 
I've got a feature request.
If I run tor by itself, it nicely uses default values for
everything and runs smoothly.
If a torrc file does exist, it assumes everything is specified.
If I wanted to just specify one thing like "exitnode...." and
use the rest of the defaults, I can't. It complains that
ORPort and SocksPort are not defined. If these are not defined
in the torrc file, can't Tor still use the defaults it was using
when no torrc file existed?

============================== START ==============================
It didn't take too long to figure it out. This worked well for me.
 wget  -O - | grep '^router '  wget  -O - | grep '^router ' | grep -v ' 0$'
I had to get it to test out the exitnodes.
There has to be a way for users to get a list of ORs, or else
how are they going to know which ones to use for putting into the
config file eg exitnodes?
If it doesn't already, the tor toolset will probably end up having to provide this list to the users. How else would users get this
list to modify the config file with? I believe this is the list
that Geoff is referring to.
While on the subject of exitnodes, if a user specifies a small
list of exitnodes, and if the ORs are by design systems that come
and go, given a little bit of time, it is possible that the torrc config
files get out of date cuz they try to use ORs that no longer exist, and don't
list newer ORs of a given criteria. This would be a forever battle
of updating a config file, and possible that some unmaintained server
out there stops working, which sounds wrong to me. It would be very
convenient to have give it some criteria instead of specific ORs, eg "exitnodes *.com, *.edu, *.ru, *.us" or something like that. Would make
life easier for the overworked IT guy.
