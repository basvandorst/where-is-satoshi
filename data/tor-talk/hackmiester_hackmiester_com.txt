Nice :)
Hmm. Maybe we could put these in /Applications/Tor? If we did that, we could pretty it up.
These would be good in /Applications/Tor too. Hell, while we're at it, we might even do a little TorCP-like thing up in AppleScript or whatever.. or a suite of AppleScripts (Stop Tor and Privoxy, Start Tor and Privoxy, Uninstall Privoxy)... whatever works. I could assist with this if you wanted.
Nice work, mate. :-)

While I won't do that, I will have to say that Socks 4a works here.

You might want to check out ShellsNet.org - I have a shell on that site that allows forwarding. Connect using IRC to irc.shellsnet.org and join  and I'll hook you up. :-)

It should be set to either the upload or download speed of your link, depending on which one's lower.

@_subject: [SPAM] RE: Website with explanation for tor service? 
We can't do that. Go to the Tor home page and look for information about how to get that done.

FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF!!
SOMEONE MIGHT BE MORE LIKELY TO HELP YOU IF YOU WOULD STOP SCREAMING!!
I am positive the instructions are on the site, however, judging by  your writing skills I'm going to question whether you're intelligent  enough to read it.
