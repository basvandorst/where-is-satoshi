I wanted to help by adding it to F-Droid, but noticed that you use the
GPLv2. Any particular reason? As far as I know, you cannot use it with
the Android support libs - which the app uses - since they ara Apache2,
and the GPLv2 is incompatible with it. The closest options to GPLv2 are
GPLv3 and Apache2.
Please ping me when you've fixed the licensing issue and I'll finish
adding it :)

We had apps like davdroid in alpha stage for a long time, it's just a
matter of making it clear that the app is not yet deemed stable.
I just pushed it, should be available tomorrow morning at the latest.
Just out of curiosity though, wouldn't it be easier to just add this
feature into Orbot? Like an extra option or toggle switch to enable the
blocking of traffic that wouldn't go through Tor.
