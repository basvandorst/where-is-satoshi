controlled opposition is why i skreech about tor - that it is looked to as
THE SOLUTION ... they know what people are using - not as bad as controlled
demolition but...
would be more effective if people were working on different projects for
security .... as many as possible

dear lara
you have a parasite ... ideology is a belief system & belief systems are
whoever said that there already are a lot of open source tor like things
... name them here
and making things open source code umn didnt tor like do that too ?? uh
new structures need to be opensource for many reasons but moreover
designing things for privacy ... just thinking about it alone ... can
produce shifts .....that there are people 'functioning' on this list that
think thought - just the processies of thought - about design is
solutionless is a really fucking subconscious (meaning - lowest) level
i get that nsa (or somebody) has quantum computing and we are all fucked
but i dont think sitting on my ass and doing nothing is an option

You have no clue what i work on and your smart ass comments contain a wall
edge that smells like government operative ass > whether you are aware of
being a state owned piece of meat or not...
Thinking tor is the ultimate anything is an ideological belief system...

dear roger that is your opinion
all these things you state are conjecture and not based in any formulated
fact or even a tiny little data set
what was being discussed was incredibly important and as far as i am
concerned you are putting up a wall and telling people to keep their mouths
shut which i think is profoundly antithetical to anything ANYONE working on
tor project would desire
please have a think about what i wrote here

right because 'tor talk' is not 'open' to TALK about underlying
philosophical issues regarding critique of actuals within the tor framework
NEED NEW LIST TO ELIMINATE THE 'BAD APPLES'
i want to take a poll how many people on this list have the dna of western
european descent how many identify as male bodied persons and how many have
not studied philosophy that occurred before the ancient times of greece?
i call for a disengagement of the internal/personal/list shutdown button
please reread the initial post asking what the purpose of tor was .... why
the navy wanted it .... v important question that remains unanswered and it
begs why is the tor project still of desire for the navy?

dear virgil
your way is antithetical to the definition of communal - in other words you
have no clue what it means to exist in a communal space
define 'productive'
define 'adult'
if you think being an adult is hiding from reality and acting as if nothing
can be under critique that you dont want to be under critique then i know
some 3 year olds you should meet that have a few things to teach you cause
they understand the benefit of critque way more than you

Why would any orginization ever set up best practices in order to really be
dealing with sexual misconduct of an employee ? Why consider such levels of
ethics ? Wierd.
I don't see that this link to a statement from Shari Steele has been
posted yet: She concludes: "We expect that this will be our only public statement."

that any organization has not inset into its guidelines ways of really
structurally dealing with sexual misconduct is profoundly unethical

there was a suspension after tor received info about harassment before
(hint: that matters) and as i said the organization was not dealing with
this in any concrete way as they are now setting up protocol

tor is the USG
what did you think the USG makes something for you?
the USG makes something for themselves > they use you to cover their own
anonymity + thats all
isnt it kind of strange that you look to this platform as the only way -
its monolithic thinking ... just like the structure of the USG
ask yourselves how you can be disappointed from something you attached to
like a pacifier
it doesnt work > make different things
