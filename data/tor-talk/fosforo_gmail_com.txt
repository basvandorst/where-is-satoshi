Maybe not related to tor in general, but anybody knows if there is a
way to track the certificate authorities which "sold" these kind of
black boxes that changes HTTPS certificates on-the-fly, tracking users
without notice ?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Escalating hidden services 
I am a big fan of pinkmeth hidden service ( hxxp://pinkmethuylnenlz.onion/ )
But it constantly times out.
As an unix administrator, I was thinking in ways to escalate such good
public services through normal clusters, and would like opinions if my
approach is valid, to suggest it to the unknown author:
1) Frontend - Only 1 node. Entry point as normal "semi-hidden" hidden
service with 32 guards (exposed, semi-hidden)
2) Backend - X number of nodes  (escaling is here) numbers of backend
hidden services with 3 guards
1) is just a relay box, nginx with reverse connection to backend hidden
services, in a different structure than backends. round robin. 32 guards to
handle good speed and lots of circuits. anonymity is not a requirement
here. each backend hidden service is a local port in 127.0.0.1 made with
torified netcat (I think there are better approaches than netcat, would
like to know )
2) apache+mysql each node, gfs filesystem (for static files) shared among
nodes, replicated mysql database.
I see latency as a problem here [ user -> nginx (hidden) -> apache (hidden)
], but I dont see more timeouts. thoughts?

-> apache' just go 'nginx -> apache'. You can of course still use SSL to
encrypt the data
HTML on the primary .onion domain and put all static content, such as
content part really well by just returning one of several .onion domains
that all have your
the same static server is always used for the same user.
Thank you Tom.
Will look into this 2 options, sounds promising.
