Try and use a Tor bridge with obsf4 to connect to tor, you can get bridges here.

Tor version 0.2.3.25 is no longer supported and that last comment on the mtor project was more than a year ago, Latest commit f50af12 on Aug 17, 2016, so it looks like the project is no longer in development and the version of tor it is based on is extremely outdated, and not secure. Currently supported builds of tor CoreTorReleases

This would also effect Onionshare’s user hosting anonymity, it would require file hosts to Reveal their identity or there onion address would keep changing.

TorProject has added some traffic padding in Tor 0.3.1.7 And they are working on Adaptive traffic padding 254-padding-negotiation .

Major features (traffic analysis resistance):
Connections between clients and relays now send a padding cell in each direction every 1.5 to 9.5 seconds (tunable via consensus parameters). This padding will not resist specialized eavesdroppers, but it should be enough to make many ISPs' routine network flow logging less useful in traffic analysis against Tor users.
Padding is negotiated using Tor's link protocol, so both relays and clients must upgrade for this to take effect. Clients may still send padding despite the relay's version by setting ConnectionPadding 1 in torrc, and may disable padding by setting ConnectionPadding 0 in torrc. Padding may be minimized for mobile users with the torrc option ReducedConnectionPadding. Implements Proposal 251 and Section 2 of Proposal 254; closes ticket 16861 .
Relays will publish 24 hour totals of padding and non-padding cell counts to their extra-info descriptors, unless PaddingStatistics 0 is set in torrc. These 24 hour totals are also rounded to multiples of 10000.

Using a obfs4 pluggable transport bridge from   should work. As Jim said its a “arms race between the Tor developers and censors” to keep governments from blocking all the bridges.

Just use the TorBrowser Bundle and see if that fixes your issue.

It is not a good idea to be on such a old version of OS X “security exploits that have been fixed in newer versions", my advice is to update to macOS 10.13 (17A405) or the latest version and try to see if tor works then.

This is one of the reasons why we need tor browser to be sandboxed, it would make it much harder for an attacker to find two separate zero days, to get past both Firefox and the sandbox. Sent from my iPad

The service The latest TorBrowser alpha uses to connect to obtain the bridges “BridgesDB" has been down for a while, so I can not test this. It should be up and running before the stable is ready.

On the Tor Browser where you cannot connect to your onion, create a new circuit by clicking the green onion and clicking “new tor circuit for this site” and see if you can reach it. Also try setting up a next generation onion service on your server and see if the next generation service also has the issue. You can set up a V2 and V3 in onion service in tandem/side by side on the same server.
