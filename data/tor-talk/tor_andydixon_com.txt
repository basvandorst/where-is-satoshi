For what its worth, my server is a Ubuntu Maverick box, and here are some instructions for compiling..

I had this problem too. I changed my apt settings to pull the
experimental builds of Tor, updated and that worked..

@_subject: [tor-talk] Stats 
Its mainly scratching my own itch, but would anyone else find this useful?
Its a logging script which runs (for me) every minute to get stats, and
then spits it into a graph. Its buggy and ugly but its taken a bit of
load from my Munin box which was grabbing the same data.
If anyone may want to use it, i'll clean the code up. Certain coding
standards got lost whilst I coded over ssh in vi..

@_subject: [tor-talk] IP being banned - Help! 
It happens. bad users can cause IP addresses to be blacklisted, or BOFHs
can blacklist Tor endpoint IPs.
Unfortunately, my exit node suffers from the same issue, which is a
shame. :/
Depending on the blacklist, some get removed automatically after a
period of time, others (an equivalent for email, the CBL) would require
manual whitelisting.
This probably doesn't help you though...

Magnets are URLs and not files. Your torrent application will need to
support magnet links as opposed to .torrent files. You'd need to copy
the magnet link from the site and add it into your app.
