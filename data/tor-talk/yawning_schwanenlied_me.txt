DES != 3DES, and supporting 3DES suites is standard across major browsers.
Additionally, having support for something does not mean that it will be used
(unless the webserver on the remote end is horrifically misconfigured, any one
of the other CipherSuites sent in the ClientHello will be negotiated over the
3DES suites).
Considering that there are far better ways of attacking a TBB user than
attacking the bulk cryptography I'm really failing to see the issue here.

Why wouldn't it be?  As far as I can tell you have yet to come up with any
convincing reason as to why it's broken beyond "the NSA had a hand in it's
design[0]" and "the name has DES in it".
Note that Stephan Lucks' attack requires too many known plaintexts to be
relevant in this context and is still (probably) computationally infeasable.
*shrugs*  If I noticed, it would be amusing since the webserver is buring a lot
of CPU by using 3DES, and I would question the system adminstrator's
sanity/competence, but on it's own, it's not a sufficient reason for me to
ignore the site.
This is getting offtopic so I will stop now.

I'm really confused how you expect "middle relays" to implement this
sort of filtering, given that *by design*, the middle relays are
ignorant of the destination of the traffic.
Oh I know, we could add a bit in the cell header that signifies if the
cell is carrying "objectionable or evil" payload a la (RFC 3514), and
it will be up for compliant implementations to tag their packets when
they're watching pron, so that relays can filter/censor traffic as
appropriate.  There's probably fairly "interesting" anonymity
implications when certain relays won't ever be eligible to be part of
your path as well.
(As a side note how do you know that they were watching pron through
your exit?  It's usually considered a bad idea for various reasons to
look at user traffic.)

Maybe recent events will push the further development of this IETF draft
