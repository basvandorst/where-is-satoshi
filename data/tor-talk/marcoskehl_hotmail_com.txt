Hello Rainmakers!
Questions for the experts: 1. Should I disable/shutdown my anti-virus before start Tor Browser? There is any risk of being traced by my anti-virus?
2. Must I erase all the metadata inside "event logs" in Windows  8, and use CCleaner after close Tor Browser?
3. We could talk a little bit more about computer forensics. Marcos (Brazil)

Hello friends.
1. How could my exit Tor node be in Kabul or Kandahar? As "ipcatcher.net" showed many times. How it is possible a Tor ISP or relay in Afeganistan? 2. What informations my ISP manager sees when I connect Tor Browser? Something like "Https Tor Network"? Could my ISP catch or sniff some download from the first node to my pc, or the download is encrypted?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tails on virtual machine. 
Hello experts!
I had troubles running Tails as main boot on live dvd, because the internet always failed and disconected after few minutes. Even with or without spoofing my mac adress. I really don't understand why it happens.
But, running Tails on virtual machine (VMWare), it runned fine. I kown I am vulnerable trusting on my Win 8.1 as host, but I don't now any other way. tails.org says at "There are a few security issues with this approach though.
When running Tails inside a virtual machine, both the host operating system and the virtualization software are able to monitor what you are doing in Tails.
The main issue is if the host operating system is compromised with a software keylogger or other malware, which Tails does not provide any protection against? in fact, that is impossible.
Moreover traces are likely to be left on the local hard disk.
As such, this is only recommended when the other alternative is not an option or when you are absolutely sure that your host system is clean."
The questions are:
1. How can I be sure my host system is clean from KGB keyloggers, STASI spywares, NSA malwares, MOSSAD rootkits... that sees my pc screen? With HIPS? With Avast + firewall + Combofix + TrueCrypt?
2. How Truecrypt can salve me from the black hats forensic society?
3. Supposing I choose 0.001 gb for my virtual hd, what traces can be left on my host hd? Where  do I wipe out and burn then forever and ever?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Forensics on Tor 
Hey experts! Reading about Tails and Whonix, I learnd that Whonix is for virtual machines and Tails don't.  The questions are: 1. What kind of metadata could remain on Windows 8 when running Tails and Whonix on virtual machine (VMWare and VirtualBox)? Should I inquire the developers? If no metadata remains, the fact virtual machine provides us another IP and mac adress, would not be safer?  2. Should we disable or block by firewall my antivirus when running Tails or Whoinx on virtual machine? 3. No metadata remains on the live dvd-rw when running Tails as main boot? 4. No metadata remains when running Tor on Ubuntu? If yes, how can I clean it? 5. "The Tor design doesn't try to protect against an attacker who can see or measure both traffic going into the Tor network and also traffic coming out of the Tor network. That's because if you can see both flows, some simple statistics let you decide whether they match up. That could also be the case if your ISP (or your local network administrator) and the ISP of the destination server (or the destination server itself) cooperate to attack you. Tor tries to protect against traffic analysis, where an attacker tries to learn whom to investigate, but Tor can't protect against traffic confirmation (also known as end-to-end correlation), where an attacker tries to confirm an hypothesis by monitoring the right locations in the network and then doing the math" The sentence above means that downloads through Tor are encrypted? If yes, it means that, even if the entry node and the exit node are compromissed, the attacker can't easily decrypt what I have downloaded? Cheers!Marcos Kehl (Brasil)

I use Tor Browser for all web browsing as many of you probably do.  A
frequent problem is you will be logged in to various sites and then the
connection will break.  For instance, attempting to make any request
gives "Firefox could not establish a connection to the server at ...".
Changing identities will always rectify the problem, but doing so via
the onion button causes all open windows and tabs to be closed, which
means you have to log back in and then get back to whatever page you
were on.  This is especially troublesome if you were filling out a form
or completing a multi-step process in a web application.
Is there a way to change identities or just circuits without closing
everything and without using an external application?  I understand the
browser is closed and re-opened when you request a new identity to
prevent your identity from being associated with your prior identity,
but sometimes you do not need a new identity and just want to fix the
I do not think this a problem specific to me because it occurs on
multiple devices on multiple networks.

Wiretapping?  Please.  Web sites (that want to) & their 3rd party associates (trackers) track users from one end to the other.
More speculation.  A good question is, *who requested* that the Carnegie Mellon *lawyers* make a request to Black Hat to cancel the talk on identifying Tor users?
We must ask, did Carnegie Mellon really think Tor Project would sue them?  Hardly.
Did they think the gov't would sue them on behalf of Tor Project? No.
Which entities would have the most to lose if this Tor weakness was exposed?
Which entities are most interested in cracking Tor?
That possibly resulted in certain people stopping their Tor use and / or the weakness being patched, so possibly not as much valuable user info was available?
The Disney Co?  EFF.org?  Amazon?  No, not likely.
In any good investigation, detectives follow motive & money. *IF*... the gov't is or could be involved in something (/not saying they are here, but could be/), then the "means" is *almost always* there, if it's important enough.  As we saw from Snowden's documents the incredible, unbelievable things they were able to do (at incredible expense & manpower).
Whether the gov't was involved in the talk being cancelled *aside*, we can't forget that the programs detailed in Snowden's document, have NOT stopped, or even slowed down.
Yes, officials appeared before Congress (more than once).
Yes, they were caught in bald faced lies (perjury?).
*No, nothing was done* / no action taken by anyone, to reign in or slow down these programs (which literally cost a fortune in taxpayers' money).

Scott Arciszewski transcribed 0.9K bytes:
Many sites use HTML5 canvas fingerprinting. Visiting either
 or should trigger that little dialogue about "accessing the canvas" in TorBrowser
Can I ask you a question? When this dialogue (the one) comes up, what do you usually do? Do you click the "Allow in the Future"
button? Or click the little "X" in the corner? Or something else?
TorBrowser is patched to block attempts by websites to access HTML5 canvases,
since there isn't much legitimate purpose for a site to do this, other than to
track you as that article you linked points out.
However, if you've already clicked the "Allow in the Future" button on the
little dialogue that comes down from the URL bar when a site attempts to do
this, there isn't currently an easy way to revoke the permission you gave. [0]
Additionally, there appears to be an issue in nsIPermissionManager (used by
TorButton when "New Identity" is clicked), because the permissions currently
aren't being cleared properly. [1]
For now, my best advice is to be very careful allowing any site to access
HTML5 canvases until we make it easier to revoke the permission. (In other
words, click the little "X" next time. :) )

Hello experts!
TAILS, running by usb stick, protect me against forensics tecnics in my pc. Ok. TOR, running as a client only or as a relay, protect (theoretically) my privacy. Ok.
But... if my static IP, provided by my ISP, is under surveillance by a legal requirement, what kind of data they can sniff?
 I mean, my connection looks like a simple HTTPS, or they know I am diving into the Deep Web, "hacking the world"? Could the ISP capture the downloads dropping into my pc when running TAILS? If so, TOR Socks (proxy + TOR) is the pathway to deceive and blindfold my ISP? Marcos Kehl (Brazil)

Hi Marcos,
1. Do you run a relay yourself yet?
2. Combination of all of them
3. Current speed is good, in the future it will either get better, stay the same, or get worse, depending on how much the community contributes.
Thank you for answering Tom. 1. I use Tails with Persistence mode, and, as far as I know, Tails does not allow me to
   be a relay. Am I correct?    I have my first contact with Tor in a CompTia Network 005 course (thank you a lot professormesser.com), here in Brasil,when studing about proxies. I remember the option of setting up a relay in Windows TBB. I really like the idea of contributing as a relay, but since I started
using Tails, I did not find this option. And I am pretty sure I will never
use Tor inside Windows enviroment again. I nuked this bad behavior from orbit, after
learn something about digital forensics.       Also, I respect and admire the Whonix team, but, for me, Tails is almost the perfect
O.S. to go. Furthermore, I would like to recommend you folks, the very intersting videos of Adrian Crenshaw, from Irongeek.com about the "Darknets".
To finish, I would like your opinion about packet captions from Tor Network, running
 Wireshark or similar. I know a little from the topologie of  entry guards - middle nodes - exit nodes,
and how it is "safe" diving among the middle nodes from the adversary running Wireshark
at his exit node in the end of the World. But, what kind of packets an adversary could catch if I am using Tor behind a NAT and this adversary is running Wireshark behind that same NAT, we both inside the same intranet. Or if this adversary is inside my ISP, knowing I am connect to Tor, maybe hacking NSA and their "freedon fighters buddies" of FSA?

Current Tor connection speed is pretty neat, few years ago it was much
slower, like in order of magnitude slower. If you find Tor slow, maybe
it's time to contribute? I myself contribute for that reason, serving
some relays/exits on 100Mbit-1Gbit lanes. If you don't want to run a
relay yourself, maybe it'd be a good idea to donate few bucks to those
who do? torservers.net for example.
You've answered yourself :-)
