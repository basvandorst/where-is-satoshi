@_subject: TOR-Server koehntopp down 
My machine generated a traffic spike of 80.000 packets per second at 5 mbyte/sec, that's 64 byte/packet, a flood ping. Provider logs and my own stats agree on this:
(spike around 1:30am before machine cut off network)
The tor stats do not register that traffic, so tor probably isn't the source of that flood ping.

GEMA asks (german) Providers to block websites
The german Society for musical production and reproduction rights (GEMA) asks 42 german access providers to block multiple websites. These are portals that offer links to film and music files for the P2P protocol eDonkey, the german language sites Eselfilme, Goldesel, Saugstube, Audio-Esel and Power-Portal.
While it would be a mistake to advertise OR as a tool to circumvent this ( at the moment it is completely random if a user of OR is subject to such a ban or not.
Such IP blocks are usually byproducts of national legislation. Would it be useful to include the nationality of a node as part of its family declaration and select preferred exit nodes based on them being in a certain nationality family or not being in them?

Unter der Hand war von mehreren Providern bereits zu h?ren, dass erwogen wird, die Sperrungsaufforderung mit einer negativen Feststellungsklage zu kontern. Im Rahmen einer solchen Klage k?nnten die betroffenen Unternehmen auf eigene Initiative gerichtlich kl?ren lassen, ob die von der GEMA geltend gemachten Anspr?che rechtlich Bestand haben. Die GEMA selbst war am heutigen Freitag Nachmittag nicht f?r eine Stellungnahme zu rough translation:
Off protocol, several providers said that they are considering a negative declaratory action. With such an action, the companies could find out on their own time if the requirements by GEMA have substance. GEMA itself was not available for comment this friday afternoon.
The whole thing is a followup to the blockage order by J?rgen B?ssow of the D?sseldorf administration against several nazi propaganda websites. There was a process against these blockage orders by Alvar Freude of  which he lost.
The current GEMA action is a trail to extend this blockage order to civil law, and use it for copyright enforcement.

This is basically a question of using your proxy or not. You can control the behaviour of your browser in great detail writing a proxy.pac program in Javascript and setting that program as the proxy autoconfiguration URL in your browser.
An example:
kris at jordan01:~> cat /srv/www/htdocs/proxy.pac
function FindProxyForURL(url, host)
        var proxy_yes = "PROXY jordan01.int.cinetic.de:3128";
        var proxy_no  = "DIRECT";
        // Redirect all accesses to mlan hosts to the mlan proxy
        if (dnsDomainIs(host, ".mlan.cinetic.de")) {
                return proxy_yes;
        }
        // Everything else is direct
        return proxy_no;
So here the program checks if the destination is a mlan-Host, and if so, uses the appropriate proxy on jordan for the access, while all other accesses are direct.
You could do a similar thing with .onion accesses with a trivial

SORBS lists tor entry nodes as "trojaned machines" in their black lists.
My reply to them:
I do not think that you understand how tor works.
tor is an anonymous proxy network. Each node lets users connect to the
network, then routes packets around the network in a random and encrypted
fashion and then an exit node makes a connect to the service.
Even if I blocked NNTP and IRC on my node, a connect to my node would yield a
successful IRC and NNTP connect as long as any node on tor has NNTP and IRC
open. That is how tor is designed to work.
Anyway, my node is neither trojaned nor a zombie. Please unlist my tor nodes
IP from your blacklist and make sure it does not get on it again. This is a
managed tor node with a listed contact address and requests for blocked exit
IPs are honored.

I can almost certainly say it's the Tor Node.
You have 2 choices (assuming you want to continue running tor):
1/ Seperate your mailserver from your Tor node.
2/ Stop Tor access to IRC, and NNTP as well as SMTP.
The SORBS servers look for open proxy servers and IRC bound trojans.  We
test to SMTP and NNTP on the standard ports, as well as listening to IRC
server connections for trojans.

This is essentially a request to shut down tor, and I don't think they really want to listen. Has anybody ever tried to sue a delisting out of them?
----------  Forwarded Message  ----------
Actually I understand perfectly well how it works, it is an open proxy
system that anonymizes abuse and legitimate users.
Correct - and that traffic leaving your machine whether it be your
client or a remote anonymous tor client is the reason for the listing.
Then take this as a request - do not allow remote tor connections to IRC
networks which I run or am running a IRC trojan data collector on.
Further do not allow any SMTP or NNTP traffic to exit your tor node to
any network I am collecting data from.  I cannot disclose said networks
because I am under NDA (this even applies to the fact none of the other
SORBS admins know some of the networks that the SORBS collectors run
on).  If you want to keep delisted from SORBS, you will have to stop
traffic to IRC networks, SMTP services (25, 465, and 587) as well as
NNTP (119, and 563).
You are accountable for abuse from your server, and I don't care whether
it is from the tor network or not.  You have gone to great lengths to
ensure that the traffic from the tor network appears to be originated by
you, so as far as I and SORBS is concerned you are responsible said traffic.

German Language observation of MITM attack on STARTTLS command string
"For those that do not understand: the first route is via a direct peering
between hetzner and metabone. The second route is via British Telecom, Cable
and Wireless and Noris (but physically completely in Germany). The first
route shows a typical Exim-SMTP-Banner advertising encryption capability
("STARTTLS"). When connection via the second route, the STARTTLS capability
has been replaced with letter X, and the target exim also does no longer
accept STARTTLS. Obviously a snooping device has decided to intercept and
blocks SMTP encryption capabilities. What is the lesson here? Don't do away
with PGP. Then they can block delivery, but won't get to the plain text.
There are transparent Spam- and Virus-Filters available on the market which
work similarly. But then the server will act identically for each route.
Another detail: Why is the STARTTLS not being filtered, but Xed out? Because
this is TCP. If you change the amount of data, you'll have to track the
datastream and fix offsets in all packets. That's a lot more work to do.
Because they did it that simple, it is clear that this is not a proxy,
because it would act on a higher layer and would have gained no advantage
from this approach (Thanks nibbler for the pointer)
