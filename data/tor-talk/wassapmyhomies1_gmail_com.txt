@_subject: [tor-talk] Gmail account without phone number 
I have been reading on this mailing list that it is not possible to create
a Gmail account without a phone number.
I have just created such an account (this one).
I was curious if this is a change on Gmail's part or if the conditions of
my sign up were not the same as those having problems.
I created this account without using Tor, so perhaps that is the critical

Hey Joe,
The conditions were:
1) No Tor
2) Chrome Browser
3) Regular ISP
2) Registered from Canada
I just went to their login page, and clicked on sign up for an account link.
Then I just filled in all the fields EXCEPT the phone number and
alternative email fields (I have tried it both filled in and without and it
works for both).
And then clicked next and I was auto logged in to my Google account.
I have done another test using Tor (from the Tor Browser Bundle) and this
time Gmail did ask me to verify using a phone number and would not let me
get through.
Hope that helps clear things up.

Hi Joe,
I'll clarify the auto-login: After sign up it logged me in with the
credentials I had just created. Why would it use cookies from a previous,
different account login, to log in to this new account? Wouldn't that be a
security hole?
