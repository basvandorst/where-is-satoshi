Greetings from Turkey,
Today, Tor Project and Youtube websites are blocked in Turkey by the
biggest Turkish ISP, TTNet. However, other ISPs in Turkey will block them
too. Besides, I'm not sure they're going to block Exit Nodes in days to
come but probably they'll.

Thanks for the link. Many Turkish users are sharing Tor download mirrors
in the Twitter. But I have to tell there's a bad perception about Tor in
many Turkish users like "I installed Tor, I heard criminals etc. using
Tor, I couldn't find the uninstaller, then I format my PC, am I safe now?"
as usual. Mostly, they're choosing some paid/free VPN services due to this
and slightly ignoring the Tor block. I got many comments at my blog about
The block probably depends on the new tapes which will leak in the next
days. If a tape or a video will come like today's, I can't guess what will
happen. I heard a rumour about blocking VPN to prevent new tape scandals.
After the new Internet Legislation called 5651, they're going to establish
a union called "Eri?im Sa?lay?c?lar? Birli?i" (more like Service
Provider's Union) under the control of T?B (Telecommmunication Presidency)
and T?B has a president from M?T (Turkish Intelligence Agency) origin
which makes it under the control of M?T and all ISPs traffic will route
there. It makes DPI and etc easier for them too.

Hey Gordon,
Thanks for the article. I can say Erdogan has a straw man fallacy what is
obvious. He's finding a straw man, then exaggerating it with his media
power and publicizing it as a scapegoat. The worse and the more dangerous
part is he's making this with victimizing himself like "they attacked my
sisters, drunk alcohol in the mosque etc".
However, there's a news about "Facebook is going to block too" on the TV
tonight. News says "Telecommunication Presidency (T?B) is going to block
Facebook in 2 days due to national security." Btw, it's the same reason
with the Youtube block. Some of my friends says, Youtube is too slow,
experiencing SSL handshake errors. I guess they're making DPI maybe some
other analysis or MITM.
You're right. I'm working on this. 2 days ago I wrote an article called
"Is Tor a ghoul?" in Turkish and it's about what actually Tor is. But it's
really hard to remove straw men and I'm open for the advices.

Hey Andrew,
Frankly, I admire Tor Project. I'm writing about censorship, privacy,
surveillance ands similar subjects over a year. If I didn't have Tor or
other anonymity tools, I wouldn't express myself freely. Maybe I
auto-censor or self-censor my thoughts or writings I though. Actually, I
need to thank you for giving me this opportunity.
I wrote very similar in the article. I gave two examples. First one is an
individual expressing himself/herself freely over Tor in an oppressing
regime. Second one is a jerk who is abusing people over Tor. If you
evaluate Tor over the jerk and say this is what Tor is, you're making a
logical fallacy.
I think there are two ways to do that. First way changing the perception
of Tor in here. Second way is raising awareness of Turkish Tor users.
Because I read some posts about suggesting Adblock and some add-ons with
plugins like Flash etc. I wrote installing and using add-ons or plugins
may leak your IP, your graphic card info, take away your anonymity, it's
not a good idea to change Tor Browser's environment by installing these
and this will make it more unique. I don't know what it's called in
English but creating some simple info graphics about Tor, using Bridges,
what to do and what not to do both English and Turkish would be nice.
You're very welcome.

FYI, today OpenDNS and Google public DNS servers are blocked too. Other
than that, they're redirecting DNS queries to ISP servers automatically if
you try to use Google or OpenDNS servers. Probably, they're started to use
transparent DNS proxy. Btw, they're blocked them one day before the
election day.

How about using network23.org or noblogs.org if you're looking for only Wordpress? These autonomous services are quite good but I have to inform you, they're not that flexible to use plug-in or theme. So, your options are limited in these services.
Good luck!
