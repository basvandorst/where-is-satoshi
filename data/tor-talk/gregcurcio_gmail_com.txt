guys, i am not trying to be rude. i'm a sensitive. never been called rude.
i am 30 % fascinated by your back and forth. and 95% clueless
i didnt know that you ALL can see what i wrote,
i thought , or didnt think,:) it was like a regular chat, whomever was on
at the time saw what
i wrote, now i get it. Cant assume so much. like a lawyer or judge, and
hopefully a reporter and a spy,  they cant assume stuff. ok thanks.
