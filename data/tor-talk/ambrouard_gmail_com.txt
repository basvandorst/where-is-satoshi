@_subject: [tor-talk] Securing a hidden service 
I'm trying to make my hidden service more secure. It runs on a server
running Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS server version. I have set up full disk
encryption and a basic firewall but I want to do more. If an attacker
managed to compromise nginx or apache (whichever I decide to use), is there
a way I can prevent the web server from sending any data outside of the Tor
network? An apparmor profile or something?

Thank you for your help. Is there some way for me to prevent nginx or thw
"www-data" user from sending out any data except through 127.0.0.1:9050 (or
whichever port it is that I have to use)? An iptables rule?
