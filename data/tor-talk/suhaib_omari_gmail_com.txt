Dear All;
I'm a master student in computer science and I have a task from my
professor to know more about Tor networks and how it works to  anonymise the
traffic. I've read a lot about Tor and I got a very good idea about it. My
task goal is to show how Tor works and to proof that it relay anonymise user
traffic. In other word, I need to make something deliverable (e.g lab
experiment) to the student if they follow my steps then I can confess them
with :
1- That Tor route from client to server can't be traced.
2- How that each relay in tor circuit can only know the predecessor and
successor (e.g to print the packets info to show the the source and
destination IPs are something other than the client and server        IPs).
3-  to see if the Tor routes can be traced (we need to find a way to trace
it), how the packets are processed at each node along the routes. This will
help us and learners figure out how the Tor uses the        "onion"
concepts to hide the route info.
I've installed Shadow + Tor plugin to my ubuntu 16.04 and I run the tor
minimal tor example. I got the results . Is it possible to show the above
things from the result I got from shadow and your used plug-in??
Notes: My mother tongue is not English , so apologize if I did any mistake
in my email.
          I did my best before sending this Email, but since I have a dead
line and the due date is getting soon and soon Im asking for your help.
Your cooperation and help will be extremely appreciated.
Thanks and Best Regards,
Suhaib Mbarak

Dear Lee,
First of all thank you very much for your high response.
As I mentioned in my email above , I'm using shadow simulator; not real tor
network; my goal is only to run an experiment and from the output of that
experiment I can confess my students that Tor really :
 1-  Can keep the traffic anonymous.(at least through Tor onion circuit)
 2-  How the circuit was selected. ( or to figure out what was the circuit
 3-  All handshakes done at each node on the circuit from entry node till
exit. (e.g encryption and decryption keys used on handshake at each node
including the directory         authority server as well).
 4-  If there is away to show student that at each circuit nodes only the
successor and predecessor addresses not the original source or final
destination of the request.
Thanks and Best Regards,

Dear all.
My question is to make sure wether tor source code is open and available
for public or not?
In case it is open source and can be modified how it is secure?!!!!

Thank Toy very much for your response.
Regarding the Tor's source code I have many questions:
1- how can I download the latest stable release. I found the link for
source code bust I couldn't figure out which is the latest and how to
download the latest release.
2- Is there any detailed documentation for Tor's source code in order to
understand it and be able to maintain it.
3- Is the Tor plug-in used with Shadow simulator updated and implementing
all processes done by Tor.

Dear Seth Schoen:
Thank you very much for your extremely appreciated answer:
It seems that you were the most person who got what I'm looking for.
To be honest I'm doing my best to find away to figure out how to achieve my
goal to show student how TOR works as I explained in my last email to you.
I'm using Shadow as network simulator it is running tor as a plugin
attached to Shadow but I couldn't change the tor clients code to log the
information which I need.
Can you please help me step by step (back and forth between us) to do
something deliverable??
*Note ::: my previous email was the following:*
*I'm a master student and doing some researches on TOR . I'm using shadow
simulator; not real tor network; my goal is only to run an experiment and
from the output of that experiment I can confess my students that Tor
really :*
* 1-  How the onion circuit was selected. ( or to figure out what was the

* 2-  Can keep the traffic anonymous.(at least through Tor onion circuit)*
* 3-  All handshakes done at each node on the circuit from entry node till

including the directory         authority server as well).*
* 4-  If there is away to show student that at each circuit nodes only the

*and your reply was :*
