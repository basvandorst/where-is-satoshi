As I understand the sequence of events:
 1) Use BitTorrent
 2) Connection drops
 3) TBB cannot connect
 4) You restart the router
 5) You started using meek-google; everything is working
My first question is: between steps 4 and 5, did you try using Tor
without meek-google? If so, was it still unable to connect?
Some additional questions: Have you been able to replicate this issue
at all? Have you determined if it is BitTorrent which seems to cause
the connection to drop? Is it only downloading Tails that causes the
The reason I ask these questions is because I do have experience with
a wireless router that (to the extent I can determine) gets overloaded
by BitTorrent traffic. When this overload happens, the router
essentially stops relaying traffic and seems to drop the Wifi link.
However, the wireless router would continue to broadcast its SSID
(confirmed with airodump-ng), implying that it was still active to
some extent.
As you describe, other people using this router were unable to relay
traffic. Restarting the router would fix the problem.
I should also note that in this case the router is customer-supplied
and is separate from the modem supplied by the ISP.
Hopefully this is less alarming.
