@_subject: [tor-talk] Question about running Tor + Tor Browser 
I use Tor, but I cannot stand the TBB.  Too buggy and pathetically slow.  I
have a powerful Ubuntu laptop and the Tor Browser Bundle gets so bogged
down and unusable that I stop using it...

@_subject: [tor-talk] Ubuntu Dash search 
If anyone out there uses Ubuntu with Tor installed (not the TBB) and set
for SOCKS5 system-wide will the Ubuntu Dash perform its online searches
anonymously or is it bypassed?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Updating Tor Browser Bundle 
Is there a functional reason Tor uses Firefox for the TBB?  I personally
like Chromium, so I have the Tor packages installed in Ubuntu and use that
system wide instead of the TBB.
