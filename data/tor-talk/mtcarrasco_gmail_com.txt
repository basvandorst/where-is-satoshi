How can one delete certificates?
Deleted certificates just reappear.
There are a few from the infamous DigiNotar.

The rationale is that I want to minimise the number of certificates and I would like to keep only the ones that I really use.
At present, I cannot delete certificates: I delete certificates and they reappear the next time I go back and view the certificates.
* Server
You statement is correct and the DigiNotar certificate is not trusted.
* Authorities
For example the first certificate: T?RKTRUSTE, all the three trust setting are ticked on. When I edit the trust and tick them off, the next time I start Tor the trust setting are on again.
