@_subject: [tor-talk] Looking for a tool to replace vidalia? 
I'm looking for a tool to replace my use of the deprecated/unmaintained vidalia.
Do you know of any tool that:
- displays tor circuits and the streams attached to it? It is not required to display them on a map, but it should display the 3 nicknames with country information and the streams attached to it by their destination and port (hostname).
- allows me to kill specific circuits
Nyx displays circuits but not the streams attached to them, right?
Or did I overlook a Nyx feature?

Oh great thanks for the pointers.
I tried it shortly and realized another vidalia feature I used: bandwidth graphs
Would be great if you could add that functionality.
How does one configure/specify non-defaults for onioncircuits?
- the target IP address - ControlPort - unix socket file
- ControlPort password?
The man page and help output does not say anything about it.
(I'm using onioncircuits 0.4-3 from Debian)
