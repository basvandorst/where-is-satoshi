It's most likely back logged traffic analysis work, remotely followed by a break in 1024 RSA a la twirl.
There was some chatter that RC4 could be compromised. Most of us felt that it's really old ciphertext though that's now obsolete. Chinese communique from 1993 over the PSC's future could still be useful etc.

Cryptography at randombit is generally good for the first. Without knowing the area of security you're interested in, I'd recommend Full Disclosure; generally things get side tracked often enough that only a cursory on topic reference is needed and the discussions can be interesting.
