Hi Mirko,
1: by German law a Tor node admin is something like an access provider.
You are not responsible for your traffic. If the court have only an IP
address and you have a tor status log, they have nothing.
2: Tor is a legal service in Germany (today and yesterday, tomorrow we
will see). If you provided only a legal service, it is no way to
construct a case of aiding and abetting and you are not a disquieter or
something like that.
3: May be, there is a judge, who do not these facts. The law depends not
only on one judge. Dont give up.
4: You need help. Try to contact the following organizations:
  - AK Vorratsdatenspeicherung (data retention free contact form ;-) at
     )
  - German Privacy Foundation e.V i.Gr. (data rentention free contact
    form at  )
  - Humanistische Union e.V. (They have lawyers by training and they are
    interested in TOR.)
  - Chaos Computer Club,
  - Heise Verlag, try to contact the journalist H. Bleich
By the way (for other admins), it is not a good solution, to ignore the
first letter. Go to the "visit" and explain, what you have done and what
you have not done.

Hi tor admins,
German version for Krauts:
das folgende ist eine inoffizielle Antwort vom Admin-Team der German
Privacy Foundation e.V. i.Gr, dies ist nicht(!) die abschlie?ende
Beurteilung des Vorstandes:
1: Die Foundation ist derzeit noch in Gr?ndung. Wir haben absolut kein
Geld. Selbst unsere Server m?ssen wir als Admins selbst selbst bezahlen,
es gibt keinen Zuschuss von der Foundation. Zu erwartende
Rechtsstreitigkeiten werden von den Mitgliedern gemeinsam getragen.
2: Es ist zu erwarten, dass sich diese Situation in kommenden halben
Jahr mit der Anerkennung der Gemeinn?tzigkeit bessert, so dass wir ein
Konto f?r Probleme einrichten k?nnen und auch Spenden annehmen. Derzeit
k?nnen wir keine Zusagen machen, die wir finanziell nicht absch?tzen k?nnen.
3: Wir haben eine Basis f?r einen Verein, dessen Ziel die
Aufrechterhaltung einer anonymen Infrastruktur im WWW ist (nicht nur
TOR, auch f?r andere Projekte). Im Gegensatz zum AK
Vorratsdatenspeicherung, der in erster Linie politisch arbeitet, wollen
wir vor allem auf technisch/juristischer Ebene t?tig werden.
4: Wir haben ausgezeichnete Pressekontakte und sind auf dem Weg,
juristische Unterst?tzung "auf Abruf" als R?ckendeckung zu organisieren.
Es ist nicht einfach, einen neuen Verein aufzubauen.
5: Es ist in der Foundation Konsens, dass wir nicht die juristische
Verantwortung f?r einen Server ?bernehmen, zu dem wir keinen Root-Zugang
haben. Unsere Server werden im Team betreut und die darauf laufenden
Dienste sind mit dem Vorstand abgestimmt.
6: Zur Unterst?tzung von TOR-Admins versuchen wir vielf?ltige Varianten,
beispielsweise Schulungen f?r Juristen und Strafverfolger zum Wesen von
Anonymisierungsdiensten.....  Ein mit Kosten verbundener Rechtsbeistand
ist nicht die einzige M?glichkeit und kann auch missbraucht werden.
Meldet euch rechtzeitig, nicht erst, wenn das Kind im Brunnen liegt!
7: Wer einen eigenen Verein f?r seinen Server gr?nden m?chte, braucht
mindestens 7 Mitglieder. Er kann sich an uns wenden. Wir k?nnen Hilfe
bei der Ausarbeitung einer Satzung bieten, bei der Erlangung der
Gemeinn?tzigkeit, Pressekontakte usw. Viele kleine Vereine sind in
unseren Augen durchaus eine Alternative zu einem Monster-Verein, der

Soweit zur GPF e.V. Es hat einige Monate gebraucht, um diesen Stand zu

Hi onion guys,
we want to write about a few points of the European Cybercrime
Convention, which became real by law in Germany last time.
Sorry - we didnt read the or-talk very carefully last time. May be, it
was always discussed here.
By the European Cybercrime Convention anon servers are something like
telephone providers. The following is important because of this fact:
 1: data retention (was discussed here, in Germany real by ?113 StPO)
 2: Realtime surveillance by European Cybercrime Convention (article 20)
    The traffic data (not the traffic itself) has to be provided for the
    governments and secret services in REALTIME by a defined interface.
    Anon servers have to provide all data, which have to be logged in
    realtime too! Admins of anon servers have to cooperate.
    (In Germany this is real by the new ? 100g StPO, the realtime
     surveillance can run for up to 3 days without asking a judge.)
 3: Online-searching of servers by European Cybercrime Convention:
    An online searching (Online-Durchsuchung) of an anon server may be
    run before investigation to save relevant data, which may be not
    accessible after investigation. This online searching depends not on
    the cooperation of the admins and may be reached by repressions.
    (In Germany this is real by the new ? 110 (3) StPO.)
Thanks to K. Raven for feature out this new laws.
For point 3 we recommend to be prepared. It may be possible to create a
high secured account with only read access to relevant data and no read
access to any important key. If someone login with this account, it may
be possible to run several actions.
If the situation appears, you may decide, what you want to do (give them
the account data or take the repressions). But you will not have the
time to create such an account carefully.
Can anyone write a shot tutorial for creation of a high secured

So we ask the tor community, to keep tor non-commercial at all. If a

@_subject: German data rentention law 
I. part: A short overview about the data rentention law in Germany.
  1: ISPs have to log the start and end of a user dial-in with
     time stamp and IP address. They have not to log any content.
  2: Public provider of electronic mail have to log all connections of
     users with time stamp, IP address, login account and the email
     addresses of sender and recipient for every mail (send and
     receive).
  3: VoIP provider have to log all connections with timestamp,
     IP address and phone number of caller and recipient.
  4: Fon and mobile fon provider have to log all connections and
     tries with timestamp, phone number and location.
  5: Anon services have to log the rewrite of any information, which
     will be logged by a third party. (Thats all, not very clear.)
At the moment, it seems not clear, how tor is affected by this law.
I read some papers from the gouverment: "An anon service (like tor or
JAP) has to log, because the law will be useless otherwise."
Some papers of non-gouverment organizations like ULD: "Tor and JAP are
not affected by the telecommunication law, because it is not a
telecommunication service (in the case of law) and tor nodes have NOT
to log."
Together with the JonDos GmbH (JAP) the GPF try to get a legal
non-logging solution for tor, but the result is open and we are late.
(May be too late?)
II. part: suggestion of a technical solution
May be, tor can use geoip and divide the world in a logging area and a
non-logging area. If the target host is inside the logging area
(Germany), the exit node has to be outside. Otherwise a german node
can be an exit too.
In this case, we have two possibilities:
  1: the target host is outside the logging area -> no logging
  2: the target host is inside the logging area -> the exit is
     outside and writes no logs -> an german entry or middle man
     has to log nothing, because it routes to a not logging exit.
Because not all clients will update to a new version very quickly,
we need a feature for german exit nodes to reject all routes from old
clients, when the node is the exit of the route.
Or, if it was more simple for the developer, a feature for exit nodes
to define a country (based on geoip) to reject all exit routes. If all
german relays used this feature, it may work.
Otherwise, all german nodes have to switch to middle man.
It is only one suggestion, not the really best solution.

Sometimes you have to allow some sites to request some other stuff.

This is done like NoScript. If you were familiar with NoScript, it is

If your browser is personalized by a long life google cookie, you can

The problem is not only the data collection about the user. Google is

"gpfTOR", "gpfTOR2", "gpfTOR5" and "gpfTOR6" are running by the German
Privacy Foundation. Contact info is (I know, the admins of "gpfTOR6" are late and did not update the torrc,
 but MyFamily and ContactInfo will be updated for this node too.)
"gpfTOR7test" I do not know. But seems, it is down now.

Many Tor nodes are listet in some anti-spam DNSBL. We have had a
discussion here about SORBS DNSBL some times ago. All tor nodes are
listet in the "The Abusive Hosts Blocking List" The IP address of the tor exit node appears in the mail header. It is
the senders IP addres.
If the recipients mail provider uses a DNSBL which contains many tor
nodes the mail will be flagged as spam.
You can use a clean exit node for sending mail with SMTP. Check your
prefered exit nodes at If it is not listet, you can add a map address to your torrc:
  MapAddress smtp.provider.tld smtp.provider.tld.$6D3EE...(Fingerprint)
The GPF keeps one exit node clean from DNSBL. The tor node gpfTOR3 is
only listet at  (impossible to remove it, because all nodes
are listet). You can use this if you did not find an other.
ATTENTION: It will decrease your privacy! Use only very well trusted nodes.
(I did found an other solution for SMTP)

Sorry - I did NOT found an other solution. :-(
For webmail it is the same problem. Most webmail provider add the sender
IP address to the mail header:
If 23.23.23.23 was a tor node, some mail providers will set the spam
flag if a DNSBL was used.
May be, some mail providers does not add the sender IP address to the
mail header? Google Mail does not add it. Any other?

If you location was checked with Flash you can use a proxifier like
ProxyCap or Widecap to redirect all traffic from the Flash player to
Tor. A tutorial for using ProxyCap or Widecap for Flash anonymisation
was written by JonDonym. Replace Port 4001 with the Tor listen port 9050
and it will work:
  You can define a map address in your torrc file:
   MapAddress youtube.com youtube.com.{RO}

In the last years we see much less trouble by using non-German ISPs for
our Tor nodes. gpfTOR4 is hosted by coolhousing.net, gpfTOR5 and gpfTOR6
are hosted by leaseweb.nl.

It is not possible to use Evolution with Tor, because you can not set a

It is not possible for Tor to connect to your local mail server (behind
a rouer?).

with German police with this Tor nodes.
If you were running a Tor node at a German ISP and you are a German Tor
admin you will get a letter from the police time by time because of
missuse of our service for some small crimes. Somebody buy a book at
Amazon.com and did not pay $30 or stalking or something like that.
It is not a real problem. You have to go the police, explain what you
are doing... But it takes time and nobody like it.
It seems, there is no international police cooperation. The German
police see a non-German IP address and nothing happens. The Netherlands
police will get the information about a German operator of the IP
address and nothing happens too.
Think about a non-German ISP. ;-)

Server4you understand what Tor is. If you were asking the support of
Server4you for an opinion about running a Tor node you will get a clear
answer: "NO!"
Server4you does not like Tor nodes and other anonymisation services
since more than a year.
Old Tor nodes are running until Server4you will have a reason to close
it. A DMCA notice ore some spam reports are enough. Not only Tor is
affected. A JonDonym exit mix was closed by Server4you last year in the
same way (3 spam reports). (Thats our experience.)
Small update: you can use 7.5 TByte traffic per month with a Keyweb
node. May be, you can call the support of Keyweb?
