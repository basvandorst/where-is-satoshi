@_subject: bandwidth graph ok with 0.1.2.14-dev only 
my OR still periodically shows up a 24 hours "sawtooth" bandwidth
utilization using 0.1.2.15. Regarding the dropping bandwidth every night
GMT+2 it behaves exactly like 0.1.2.14. I supposed this issue to be
fixed with 0.1.2.14-dev since the bandwidth utilization with
0.1.2.14-dev doesn't change very much over the day.
Tuesday to Sunday last week running 0.1.2.15 clearly shows a sawtooth
bandwidth. Starting with Sunday evening when I downgraded to
0.1.2.14-dev the bandwidth graph looks ok again. Attached you'll find my
snmp network interface based traffic stats for the last seven days.
Is there any special code introduced in 0.1.2.14-dev fixing this issue
and has been removed again in 0.1.2.15? For the time being I think I'll
stick to 0.1.2.14-dev.

eeh? Wanna give Tor 800 MBits/s?
Tor is a cpu hog efficiently using one core only. On my Debian box the
other three cores together serve with less than 10% load having the
NumCpu config file option set to four. As I understood RSA encryption
only is done distributed on multiple cores. On Blutmagie throughput is
limited by cpu load to about 35-40 MBit/s. Bandwidth as well as a couple
of other parameters are monitored by MRTG.
Running Linux replacing the original malloc function with the
OpenBSD_malloc_Linux.c solves a couple of memory issues leading to
crashes. This has been confirmed by the Tor nodes Tonga and Blutmagie.

how should this apply to tor? The application doesn't generate any
session data. Right? Thus there are no "original data" I could alter
before storing.
Supposed you are right and to store data would imply the obligation to
collect those data before. This means every router in the German part of
the Internet would have to run some kind of data collection like Cisco's
Netflow. Furthermore beneath IP layer 3 lies an entire universe of layer
1 and 2 CWDM, DWDM, and SDH network stuff which is completely
transparent to the Internet user. Since this new law applies to
telecommunication in general and not only to Internet in specific, one
would have to collect data from those systems, too.

nope, from my understanding this is not the case. Telco operators are required to store data
they already collect, for a certain period of time. But this law doesn't require to collect
any data at all. So for German Tor operators nothing is going to change since there's
nothing to store.

nothing will change for German tor operators due to this law. It defines
how to store and how to hand over stored data to the authorities. Data
not collected at all can't be stored, right?. But this law does not
enforce tor operators to collect any data.
If the tor application would offer connection logging, and if a German
tor operator would activate it, then this tor operator will have to
store this data for six months. Please read ?113 the first sentence of
this fucking law.

maybe we first should try to find a common understanding what MITM means. Is it breaking
encrypted sessions in realtime using fake SSL certificates for example, or does it simply
mean some kind of packet sniffing against unencrypted traffic? The latter can be done quite
easy by Government, ISP, or people running Tor exits like us. A real MITM cryptographic
attack will be much more difficult to accomplish.

@_subject: feedback about 0.2.0.6-alpha (r11277), traffic pattern and memory 
my tor's cpu load and number of concurrent tcp connection graphs do
confirm Aquatorius' readings. (The cpu load graph may exceed 100% due to
four cores - 2xXeon hyper threading cpu). In comparison with tor the
extra traffic and cpu load caused by the Apache web server
 running on the same box is peanuts.
btw: besides the German BKA (German 'FBI') the German Verfassungsschutz
(Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution) does know about
tor, and they feel quite uncomfortable with it.
It might not be desirable for the tor network if a few servers do exit
most of the traffic. On the other hand pushing the limits always is
challenging. I would be happy if tor needs less memory and improves
support of multiple cores/cpus. Even with numcpu parameter set to four,
one core is running the main tor thread with max load and the other
three are more or less idle (load <10%) running the helper threads.

about three weeks ago my exit node traffic dropped from about 45 MBit/s
to 10-20 MBit/s. There's no explanation regarding network connectivity
or server environment. Within the last three weeks the traffic didn't
recover to the former value > 40 MBit/s until I generated a new

value after one day.
Does anyone have an explanation for this?

cpu usage is always near 100% as long as being swamped by new circuits.
Cpu load seems to rather depend on the number of established tcp
connections than on the provided bandwidth. With openbsd-malloc resident
process size usually has been far below 1gb even after one or two weeks.
Process now with glibc malloc is still eating up memory and I'm sure it
will crash within the next days. Total memory is 4 gb:
anonymizer2:~# hugeadm --pool-list

in any case it doesn't hurt with respect to cpu load. I'm lacking
programming skills to make hugepages work with OpenBSD_malloc_Linux
coming with the tor sources. So hugepages might reduce load be roughly
about 20% with the side effect of getting a memory leak from glibc malloc.
 developers: Is there any good news for better scalability regarding
multiple cores?

hi there,
on my exit node blutmagie the ratio of real bandwidth divided by
advertised bandwidth has increased within the last three month by a
factor of three. The "MaxAdvertisedBandwidth 2000 KB" config parameter
leads to 135 MBit/s real bandwidth. Well known TNS sites like

Hi list,
for some unknown reason my exit stopped publishing its descriptor.
Bandwidth dropped to below 3 MBit/s and the number of new tcp
connections dropped to less than 10 per second. Both seems to be
reasonable. Good! But the tor process still owns about 8000(!) open tcp
sessions in established state. I don't have a good explanation what
these sessions are used for? Cause kernel tcp timeout parameters like
tcp_timeout_established are set to rather small values, the sessions
must be really alive.
Since the pictures are small I dare to attach graphs for cpu load, new
tcp conn/s, and open tcp sessions to this mail.

In the end of all days tor traffic has to pass thru the exit nodes.
About 50% of all traffic leave tor network thru the top 15 exit nodes
only. If they can't cope with their load all nifty tor ports for
smartphones, dsl routers or whatsoever acting as entry or middle man
will be in vain.

hi there,
blutmagie Tor network status site apparently displays incorrect
bandwidth values for all nodes running version 0.2.2.15. Unlike other
tns sites blutmagie calculated bw as an average from the extra-info data
instead of using the bw peak value. So far I don't have a clue what's
going wrong. The extra-info format might have changed or my Perl script
populating the mysql db might be buggy.
Blutmagie4 which is is running v0.2.2.14 for testing purpose still shows
up with the correct bw
 All
0.2.2.15 nodes like trusted, teunTest, or the other three blutmagie
nodes are displayed with a bw being obviously much too low.
keep you posted

And cause the dirreq-history data lines are displayed behind the
ordinary read/write history data, the script summed up the dirreq
bandwidth. Thus blutmagie tns mistakenly displayed the (correct)
directory request bandwidth for all 0.2.2.15 nodes. This is fixed now.

yep, I've nothing to complain about. Police is just doing their job.
Answering inquiries has become routine. I'm fine.
All I wanted to say is that in Germany one has to expect about 0,5
inquiries per MBit/s average per year as an exit. Altogether so far I've
got about 50 inquiries in writing plus about 20-30 phone calls from
police, "Staatsanwaltschaft" (don't know the correct English term), and
secret services.
It really has become an advantage providing my "own" pi address space.
Thus according to ripe registry database police assumes me being the isp
and asking me about customer data. Otherwise without own address space
an isp would point with their finger on me being the bad guy. This
certainly would lead to police knocking on my door.

starting multiple instances on a single piece of hardware is the

I disagree Morphium's position mainly for the same reasons Mike and Jake
already pointed out. If the operators really care about their nodes
they'll certainly contact Tor admins. Damaging Tor's reputation in the
public due to exit sniffing imo is much more worse than loosing some
those five high bandwidth nodes with suspicious exit policies haven't
been chosen randomly.

Hi folks,
to support World IPv6 Day I intend to limit torstatus.blutmagie.de
connectivity to IPv6 on Wednesday next week. My plan is to remove the
IPv4 A record from dns for 24h, leaving the AAAA record behind. The
machine will keep its IPv4 address and the Apache web server remains
bound to the IPv4 interface. I think this will do the trick. People who
really rely on the Tor network status site might use their local hosts
file for IPv4 address resolving.
Missing IPv4 probably will break tons of bots accessing the php main
page, ip_list_exit.php, and ip_list_all.php from all kind of profit
organizations (companies), law enforcement, governments, and military
domains. I don't care about that.
torstatus.blutmagie.de is working v4/v6 dual stacked without any known
problems for six months. I'm aware that the site will be unreachable
from the Tor network as a collateral damage.
Are there any reasons this undertaking might be a bad idea?

Blutmagie's calculated bandwidth comes from the bandwidth that a relay publishes in its "extra-info" descriptor. It is the sustained bandwidth aggregated into 15 minute chunks or so. In contrast torstatus.rueckgr.at as well as other tns sites display the bandwidth peak value.
