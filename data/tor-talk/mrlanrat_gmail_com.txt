I've created a simple python parser for Tor that will generate a csv
file from Tor's cached-descriptors and cached-consensus files.
It does not get all the data it should but it is only a first revision.
The purpose of this was to more familiarize myself with Tor for the
Google Summer of Code, Hope it is useful!
Get it here: grarpamp, I hope this helps you a little, If I can I will expand the
data that this script will collect.
Moritz Bartl, your script was very useful, I used it s a base, but
modified it a bit so that it would run on python 3.
Feedback is welcome!

Karsten, would working on TorStatus to make it work with the Metrics
database be a useful project?
Do you think either you, or someone else could mentor it? I know it's
PHP and it won't directly be a part of Metrics but it could be another
method of displaying and exporting the data.
Unfortunately I don't trust my little Java knowledge to work directly
on metrics.
If this is not needed then I'll focus on something with Python.

Hello Everyone,
I'v submitted my first GSOC proposal to the Google Melange site. It is
proposing an update of TorStatus to work with Metrics. I am aware that
this may not be the highest priority for the community so I plan to
submit an alternate proposal too.
I would greatly appreciate any feedback on it that anyone can provide.
Let me know if anyone would like me to post it here too.

Hello Everyone,
I was on IRC last week discussing my ideas for projects for the Google
Summer of code, and I would like to get input here too.
My first idea is an update to TorStatus.
The main idea for this is because the project looks like it could use
an update, and I know PHP very well. Since it looks like TorStatus is
moving to Metrics I propose that TorStatus could become a more
lightweight script that can be run on one's own Tor server(s) to
provide information on just them rather than all servers.
Functionality could also be added to configure the server or to
start/stop the tor service.
Is there interest for such a project and would it be useful?
Idea 2, HTTPS Everywhere for Google Chrome
I think that the EFF's HTTPS Everywhere for Firefox is great, and I
would love to have such an extension for Google Chrome. Unfortunately
as Sebastian pointed out in IRC, due to Google Chrome limitations, an
insecure http request would most likely be made before the http
connection started. Until this limitation in the Chrome api is
overcome I suggest that the extension be simplified to just a simple
button/icon that notifies the user if the current page is using http
where it could be using https, then if the user clicks on said icon it
would take them to the https version of the site. This extension could
also be incorporated into a future Tor extension for Chrome.
Upon further research it looks like a similar extension already
exists: But I would like to offer more than that extension, such as using the
same list of HTTPS sites that the Firefox extension uses, and not send
any unencrypted data when the user only expects HTTPS.
If during the course off GSOC (or after) Google allows the chrome api
to prevent/pause a page from loading by a plugin then I would
incorporate that, mimicking the functionality present in Firefox.
Idea 3: Python!
I see that quite a few of your projects use Python. I do not know
Python as well as PHP but am am still learning. I would like to work
on any python project for Tor as long as it is something that I can
work on while still learning more python. I was looking at the Tor
Updater script, but would like suggestions.
Ideally I would like to work with something in python so that at the
same time I can get more practice with it but I am open to anything.
Looking forward to feedback!

Exporting to CSV based of of the filters is an easy task. Is there
anyone else who would find this useful? If so I'll look into making a
PHP script that can do that right now. :)
