Orbot is built on top of the Tor network. Perhaps the closest thing for
the desktop would be Vidalia combined with the Tor Browser Bundle?

@_subject: [tor-talk] scaling .onion site? 
I'm going to assume you're referring to web (HTTP/HTTPs) traffic and not
some other form of TCP traffic, though the approaches will likely be very
There's a lot you can read up on with regards to scaling a "traditional
web site" that would apply to a popular .onion site.
For example, if the problem is you need to add additional web serving
capacity, you could move the private key for the .onion site to another
host to act as the load balancer using either HAProxy or nginx. This would
allow you to use one or more web servers behind that load balancer.
I decided to create a (hopefully) simple guide to help you here:
Outside of connecting the Tor Hidden Service configuration to the load
balancer, a lot of what consists of "scaling a site" is going to be
identical to what you will find on the internet if you search for guides
on scaling Apache, etc. (DB optimization, caching ,etc).
I hope this helps.

There's a couple of problems with this approach:
 * HAProxy doesn't know how, nor do I think nginx would know how to
resolve and send traffic to a .onion domain
 * The amount of time required to negotiate an HTTP request being proxied
from A.onion -> B.onion and then sending a request from B.onion ->
A.onion -> Client would very likely brush up against HTTP timeouts (120s)
I'm not sure what additional security or "enhancement" one might get from
such a set up, other than being able to have [B/C/D].onion behind NATs in
different locations. You could more efficiently solve that problem by
using SSH tunneling, but that would give an outside observer knowledge
that there is some kind of a link between A <-> B/C/D.
This reminds me of a common practice used in the "standard web" which is
using DNS round robin and overloading a domain such as google.com with
multiple A records. Unfortunately, Hidden Services have no such concept
(as far as I know) of having multiple endpoints responding to the same
domain name, otherwise your A/B/C/D set up could work a lot better.

If you provided an HTTP redirect, that would work, but then I (as a
consumer) would be very suspicious of the site, redirecting from one
.onion to another is a little scary.
The statement was regarding HTTP proxying, which is what we were referring
to HAProxy doing for the multiple backend onions. In that case, the
A.onion would act as the front-end and *only* interaction point with the
client, the client would have no knowledge or exposure to the B and
C.onion sites.
