@_subject: [tor-talk] Including Adblock to TBB to save bandwith 
Enter Adblock Edge:
That said, considering recent events like the continuing Cloudflare
fiasco, I tentatively agree with the TBB policy of not including
ad-blockers by default.

Please don't imply that sites like this are a "libertarian thing".

No. That's like saying that liberals support sexual freedom, so when
someone publishes a child exploitation hidden service, I should send a
snarky "liberals, prove me wrong" email.
I don't want to start a political debate on this mailing list, but
comments like that are vapid and inflammatory.

Thanks for pointing this out. I feel like this project is not what
people are discussing it as. From what I read on their site, this seems
to be tailored (albeit perhaps unintentionally) to cybercrime and doxxing.

@_subject: [tor-talk] passing a URL to Tor browser [solved ?] 
Hash: SHA256
With Tor Browser 4.0.0 on Ubuntu, this oddly just opens my default
Firefox and doesn't use Tor at all according to Tor Check.
I too (if I understand you correctly) have been unable to make Tor my
default browser, even when manually changing the GNOME settings. I'm
on Xubuntu.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to make TBB useable as "system Tor", as Tor, 
I'm not sure if you already know this, but I don't think the developers
want this implemented because of anonymity issues. TB is carefully
engineered to be undiscernible across platforms and machines, unlike
most common network applications. Having other traffic (chat, email
client, etc.) routed through the same Tor instance would greatly
decrease the traffic anonymity.
Someone please correct me if I'm wrong about this.

Remember that every TB user that is identifiable because they don't go
with the flow is one less fish in the school.
At that point, why not just use a separate daemon?
I hope someone who was involved in making these decisions comments on
this. I don't see any need to make these changes, as they will only harm
the browser's anonymity.
Also, have you checked out the network settings in the Advanced tab of
TB's preferences? By default, it's configured to use its SOCKS proxy at
127.0.0.1:9150. If you need a different configuration for Whonix, maybe
you could just patch the browser config as needed? Being more explicit
about your ultimate goal would help.

What platform are you on? I'm pretty sure you can just use a daemon, the
original way to use Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Blocking Baseless Speculation 
Seconded. Allowing people to question the project is important, but the
loonyism that we've had recently distracts people and drowns out
legitimate discussion.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Blocking Baseless Speculation 
Yeah, I was struggling with that too. At the risk of being
disrespectful, I think that "legitimate" can probably be defined as
"containing some technical understanding and rigor, and not apparently a
product of paranoid schizophrenia or a related disorder". I'm not sure
that we should block anything, but this dilemma is worth discussing
because it's a chronic problem on most popular security-related mailing

@_subject: [tor-talk] Protest Blocking Tor via CloudFlare 
The FreeBSD forums and (IIRC) download servers do the same thing, just
dropping packets from Tor exits. Very annoying. I haven't got around to
emailing them about it yet.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Override default user agent of Tor Browser ? 
I suspect you can do it the same way you can with normal Firefox.
Out of curiosity, why do you want to do this?
