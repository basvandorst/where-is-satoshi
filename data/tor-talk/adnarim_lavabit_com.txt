Oh yes sorry for that. I'm using fluxbox so I totally forgott to keep an eye for menu-entries. I uploaded a new version to the repository which shows an icon with fbpanel but I guess not in gnome. Please correct me if I'm wrong! I'll try to fix this asap.

Okay, menu-icon is now fully working in the new package :) Tested with gnome-panel and fbpanel on Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon.

0.1.1   17-Mar-2008
  o Use CMake to configure the version number that ends up getting displayed
    in the About box.
  o Update the RPM .spec file with the new CMake requirements. Patch from Oliver
    Niesner.
  o TunnelDirConns and PreferTunneledDirConns are now enabled by default as of
    Tor 0.2.0.22-rc.
  o Don't check the 'My ISP blocks connections to the Tor network' box simply
    because TunnelDirConns is enabled. Checking the box still enables
    encrypted directory connections on older Tors.
  o Add a Japanese GUI translation from Nardog
  o Updated Finnish and Swedish translations

Yes this is a known problem with the tor package. It's packaged in such a way that it's installed as service and running from the beginning. Vidalia can't attach to it. So you have to stop the tor service which is already running and remove it from the runlevels to make vidalia work.
I'll try to handle this problem in future versions of the package through the postinst-scripts.

Okay problem fixed in the new version of the package. Just update. :)
I made tor a dependencie of vidalia. So if you install vidalia tor will be installed before (if you haven't installed it by yourself before). Then in the postint-scripts I'm checking if tor is running and if it is, tor will be closed and removed from the runlevels.
Any feedback welcome.
Here's the postinst-script:
 -e
if pgrep -x tor;then
  echo "Tor is already running. This will not work with vidalia so I'm trying to kill it and because it could be a service I'm trying to remove it from the runlevels."
  pkill -x tor
  echo "The tor-service is not running. That's fine. But nevertheless I'm trying to remove it from the runlevels."
update-rc.d -f tor remove

@_subject: GSoC Idea: Packaging Tor+Vidalia 
if you are interested I can defenitivly help you with the packaging part of this task! I have already packaged vidalia for ubuntu. My solution at the moment is stopping the tor daemon and removing it from the runlevels through vidalia's postinst script. There's really no need for tor to run with every boot. That should be the users choice not the packagers. Although it is a nicer way to run tor as debian-tor user like Peter packaged it.
The next thing is if tor is configured with "ControlPort 9051" Vidalia is already attaching to it but it seems it can't change the config than. If you are interested I would like to help you with finding a proper solution for the problem.

Noone doubts that this would be the best solution but at the moment there's no way to do so. If Vidalia isn't capable of this until the next Ubuntu Code-Freeze for Interapid Ibex (8.10) I will suggest a tor package which doesn't install as a service by default.

I didn't thought about this until now but it sounds good to me. The initscript of Tor checks for having vidalia installed and If it's yes it won't start. I will further investigate this the next time.
But as said Leandro Doctors is trying to fix it in a proper way with enabling vidalia to reign the running tor-service. If this attempt will be succesfull none of these steps are necassary and I will be glad to see such a solution.
greets

Nope, never got any error with apt because of tor in Ubuntu dapper->hardy.
