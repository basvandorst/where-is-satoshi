@_subject: [tor-talk] Onion Service stock photo anyone? 
Hello everyone,
I'm writing an article about Tor and Onions Services for a German
teachers magazine [0].
The publisher suggested the standard 'guy with a ski mask' stock photo
in the header. m(
Can anyone point me to a Tor or even better Onion Service related one
that I can agree with?

Thanks in advance
