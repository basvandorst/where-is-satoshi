Good observation Lars!
YLE (Finnish Broadcasting Company) has published many GOOD news about Tor
network. There have been a lot of news about how people could protect
themselves against mass surveillance and Tor has been explained in these
news (Finnish only):
Few members of 'Ahmia project' has been helping to produce these news :)
YLE's journalist Sean Richs is a professional and cares about his stories!
At the moment, ahmia would like to promote 1) this new law
2) we would like to start a campaign 'Every Finn can donate their bandwidth
to protect privacy and freedom of speech in the world' to get new Tor nodes
all over Finland. The second one is just an idea at the moment.

@_subject: [tor-talk] More and more websites block Tor, 
Hash: SHA1
This is the main problem in Finland. I would love to run an exit node
in my home.
Last week I went to open a broadband connection and specifically asked
can I run a Tor exit node using their connection. Local Finnish ISP
Elisa told that running any servers is (formally) forbidden and I
cannot run the exit node unless I buy enterprise level connection
(which is of course more expensive). This is their business model and
they have nothing against Tor itself.
This is not really a problem in Finland. At least Finnish police
understands how the Tor network works. It is legal to provide an exit
node. Again, it is still possible that they mess up your home, but
eventually they will drop the preliminary investigation against a tor
exit node operator because Finnish law allows explicitly transmitting
third party traffic without any liability.
When I opened my connection and told to my ISP that there will be an
open wireless network for everyone they put that note into their
system. So they know that and they will make it clear if police asks
something about my connection. In Finland it is legal to keep your
wireless connection open and there will be no liability for me if
someone else uses that connection.

Is there anyone who would be interested to develop Ahmia.fi?
Ahmia.fi[1][2] is a search engine for onion sites. It mainly consists
of three Python components:
1) Django: The front-end is using Django web-framework.
2) Scrapy: The crawler is developed using Scrapy spider framework.
3) Haystack: Full text search plug-in to Django.
And the index for the crawled data is Apache Solr. I have just started
to learn how Solr works.
Is someone familiar with Solr and know how to tweak it to full text
Furthermore, any kind of other help would be most welcome. There are
always Linux admin duties, HTML/CSS design, bug fixing, and Django
development etc.

Sure we will help you and do not worry.
First of all, this is a civil case and they just try to scare you from
downloading with Bittorrent. Because you are not doing that and are able to
tell them about this they will eventually leave you alone.
However, do not write anything unrelated technical or "not 100% proof of my
guilt". Instead, you need to give a very simple and short answer to them,
including 1) you have not ever used Bittorrent and have not downloaded
anything 2) you are running Tor exit node which is an Internet router that
is transferring third party traffic and you do not know the end users nor
have any logs 3) show them that this Tor exit node is working under the law
of German (I am not from German but I know that this law is there
somewhere. Hopefully, someone will post it soon).
Further, this might be useful to know:

@_subject: [tor-talk] What is keeping the SSH connection alive? 
I have a Raspberry Pi as wireless router and Tor proxy. Everything from
wlan0 is directed to Tor. When I am taking SSH connection using this
wireless transparent proxy with my laptop the SSH connection is sometimes
left alive forever after the laptop is closed.
How it works:
1) I am taking SSH connection from my laptop to an SSH server.
2) I am walking away from my home with the laptop and the connection to the
wireless network is lost.
3) The SSH connection stays on (from the server point of view) forever.
The wireless router is keeping the SSH connection alive until I reboot it.
I don't understand how this is possible.
In the wireless router I am running the Tor software version 0.2.3.25.
Moreover, there is nothing special in the SSH server.
It seems that the connection stays on until the router is rebooted. I see
the SSH connection coming from some exit node:
[juha at server ~]$ who
juha    pts/1        2014-07-07 13:04 (:pts/2:S.0)
juha    pts/0        2014-07-07 10:43 (h-213.61.149.100.host.de.colt.net)

 ESTABLISHED 8743/sshd
The SSH server has the default settings (keep alive settings are commented
[juha at server ~]$ sudo grep -ni alive /etc/ssh/sshd_config
114: yes
119: 0
120: 3
So, how does the SSH connection is kept alive forever without the client

@_subject: [tor-talk] surveillance discussion in Finland 
Here is a very short summary of the surveillance discussion in Finland.
Ministry of Defence of Finland published a report that proposes internet
intelligence activities. The problem is that they also propose (Swedish
FRA style) MITM to cross-border communication.
In short, the report says:
"The existing legislation in Finland does not, however, address
intelligence. The Working Group therefore proposes that the Government
should initiate necessary measures to create a legal basis for
intelligence activities."
"The purpose would be to collect vital information to protect national
security against serious international threats. These could be military
or civilian in nature."
"Military and civilian authorities in charge of national security should
be granted powers to conduct cross-border intelligence to respond to
changes in the security environment."
"It is to be considered whether the Defence Forces and the Finnish
Security Intelligence Service should be given powers to conduct foreign
intelligence to gather information from individuals and on information
Ministry of Transport and Communications published their counter report
that very strongly points out that MITM attack to cross-border Internet
connections is technically problematic, unethical, ineffective and would
not necessarily yield the desired information.
With Electronic Frontier Finland we published our similar view:
My opinion and Electronic Frontier Finland opinion is that the MITM part
is problematic. The other parts of the report do not create that kind of
privacy or human right issues, are technically doable, not waste tax
money and do not break the Finnish Constitution.
There are a lot of good points in the intelligence report, for instance,
they clearly state that they do not want any encryption keys from the
companies nor want backdoors to any commercial systems. Furthermore,
there would be a strict guidelines and demand for the court warrant and
independent oversee.
MITM attach can be called a mass surveillance even if it tries to target
some traffic. The obvious problems are:
1) This is very ineffective surveillance. Real bad guys can secure and
hide their communication. Even HTTPS encrypted Facebook chat hides their
communication in this case!
2) Of course, the most problematic part is that this kind of
surveillance is unethical and illegal in any EU country. Moreover, it
would require a change to the Finnish Constitution where "The secrecy of
correspondence, telephony and other confidential communications is
inviolable.". Fortunately, it is hard to change the constitution.
3) A report promised to address how to solve a national level security
issues like large DDOS and spyware produced by another state. However,
mass surveillance is not an effective way to solve these problems.
4) Where are the options for this awkward MITM? Is this really a good
way to spend our tax money? Does it help to solve the problems?
5) Is it even technically possible to build this system? The report says
that it is still illegal to read any messages that are not related to
national level threads. How the hell they are going to just read the
communication of the bad guys? Not to mention again that basic HTTPS is
enough to secure communication.
I am optimistic. Don't worry, we will stop this nonsense. When another
ministry, mainstream media and the Constitution are against something it
is likely to fail.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Warning: 255 fake and booby trapped onion sites 
Short update about the fake onion address attack:
- Again, this is not a new phenomenon but larger scale: there is one
attacker or a group of attackers who run about 300 fake onion sites.
- The attacker has automated the fake site production. These sites came
online about simultaneously.
- Comparison can be done easily at the moment: because the attacker is
re-writing links on multiple onion directory sites we can compare the real
directory site and the fake directory site. The changed links point to fake
- The first 5 letters are same between fake onion and real onion addresses.
So, if the real site is ABCDEfg123456789.onion the fake on is
ABCDEsomething12.onion. It is easy get an onion addresses where the first 5
letters are just as you want them to be.
- The fake site acts as a transparent proxy for the real site: it is
downloading the content from the real site and after some re-write showing
it to the user who is visiting the site. We can sometimes see the Polipo
HTTP proxy error on fake sites.
- The attacker is re-writing some content, including bitcoin addresses and
links to point fake sites
- The attacker is gathering bitcoin money by spoofing those bitcoin
- It is possible and even very likely that the attacker is gathering login
credentials if you use the fake site instead of the real one.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Warning: 255 fake and booby trapped onion sites 
I noticed a while ago that there is a clone onion site for Ahmia. Now I
realized that someone is actually generated similar onion domains to all
popular onion sites and is re-writing some of the content.
For instance,
REAL Ahmia: FAKE Ahmia: Look carefully and notice the difference:
REAL DDG: FAKE DDG: It seems that the situation is this: The unknown attacker tries to direct
users to these fake sites. The attacker is running multiple onion addresses
similar to the popular onion addresses. These sites are actually working as
a transparent proxy to real sites. However, the attacker works as MITM and
rewrites some content. It is possible that the attacker is gathering
information, including user names and passwords.
I did some data mining and comparison with Ahmia.fi and seems to be that
there are at least 255 fake mirror sites. See the list

I made a comparison and noticed that the attacker is replacing all the
Bitcoin addresses. Obviously the attacker is replacing links with the fake
links too. I don't see any other difference in any level than this: The
transparent proxy is just slightly slower but hard to detect from the real
service and the HTTP server headers looks fine.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How stealth onions actually function? 
I have been playing with stealth onion services[1] to protect some of my
SSH servers from SSH MITM. I like to keep my servers as hidden as possible.
Great to have this option on Tor :) I have some questions about it and I
didn't find much information.
Could someone tell me how it actually functions? What is the difference
between basic and stealth? In addition, can an attacker verify that onions
with stealth option exists and are online?
Moreover, several research papers measure the total number of onions and we
know that someone is crawling TorHS Directories.
Does HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient protect you against these measurements?
I tested my stealth service without the passphrase on Tor client and Tor
says "Closing stream for '[scrubbed].onion': hidden service is unavailable
(try again later)."
Tor manual describes HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient option[2]:
"If configured, the hidden service is accessible for authorized clients
only. The auth-type can either be 'basic' for a general-purpose
authorization protocol or 'stealth' for a less scalable protocol that also
hides service activity from unauthorized clients. Only clients that are
listed here are authorized to access the hidden service."

Meanwhile, TorProject provides excellent onion stats too, see
This is the best data we have today.
In scientific literature these numbers vary a lot. This is because the
methods some researches have been using are very different.
How researchers have been looking for onion addresses:
- Crawling onion sites
- Looking tor2web proxy stats
- Looking leaked DNS requests (soon impossible)
- DHT spying (this should NOT be done and it's technically impossible in
the future)
Anyway, you are not going to find every existing onion address. In
addition, some onions use so called stealth mode which make them
How researches have been testing these addresses:
- Number of reachable onions over time, for instance, port scan per day and
cumulative stats
- Number of reachable onions in a certain moment, for instance, one scan
- Number of onion sites over time or a certain moment, for instance, wget
to port 80 etc.
Again, there are a lot of onions out there but nobody really knows what
services they are offering.

Ahmia.fi and msydqstlz2kzerdg.onion went offline for a short while. Someone
flooded the onion site with multiple requests per second: with randomly
selected user agent strings someone was generating GET
msydqstlz2kzerdg.onion/address/ requests.
Constant flood was similar to this:
[07/Dec/2016:04:11:04 +0100] "GET /address/... HTTP/1.1" "OS"
[07/Dec/2016:04:11:04 +0100] "GET /address/... HTTP/1.1" "like"
[07/Dec/2016:04:11:04 +0100] "GET /address/... HTTP/1.1" "NT"
As a results, Ahmia tried to load the page /address/ over and over again
and this exhausted CPU of my front-end server.

independently with their own processes

to fool people with that. The sites look like the original ones.
These sites are actually working as a transparent proxy to real sites. In

possible that the attacker is gathering information, including user names
and passwords.
My search engine Ahmia.fi filtered these fake sites. As a response,
eventually, the attacker deleted old fake sites and started to generate new
See, for instance, my own search engine Ahmia and a fake new version of it:
I filtered them again. This way I am protecting the Tor users.

Thanks Alec!
This is very useful. Especially plain HTTP sites are unsafe because the
attacker might inject something to HTTP traffic. For some weird reason many
popular sites, like CNN in your example, are not supporting HTTPS. As a
result, exit node or someone else can inject something nasty to this
traffic. Tor user may want to see videos and interactive content of these
sites and activates JS and videos (the user trusts CNN, but does not see
the problem with HTTP).

There are Tor people coming but I haven't heard concrete plans (time and
place) for the meetup. Let's organize it? :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor connection spike from Finland 
Hi all,
I noticed that Tor metrics estimate of directly connecting users from
Finland spiked from 10 000 to over 25 000.
As we can see, the number of connections from Finland has been very stable
10 000 before that.
Any ideas what happened around 2018-04-26 - 2018-04-28?
