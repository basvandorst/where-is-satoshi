How can I best make sure Tor/Polipo use my OS provided DNS servers or specifically provided DNS server(s) to be used when performing a Proxy ?

Well that's not good.  You see many DNS servers are poisoning the servers I wish to contact and when I uses a specified DNS server I get to the host.  When I do Tor many Tor connections have been DNS poisoned.
I can't use my IP address more than once or I get rejected.

Anonimity is not the goal.  Thwarting IP memory and GEOIP Location filtering is the goal.
Using; WGET --execute=http_proxy=  { also with refferal and User-Agent switches }
My DNS lookups are fine due to specifically chosen servers.  It is remote DNS servers I have to thwart.
I'm thinking their may be a; polipo.conf  setting.

KiXtart is a HLL script interpreter that has been arount for a decade or so.
As for "talking with the control port, I think you mean to communicate with Tor via TCP port 9051.  I am not sure I know how to go about that nor do I know what a NEWNYM signal I use Tor for malware analysis specifically to deal with GEO IP dependencies and thwart IP blacklisting by malicious sites (often you have ONE chance to download malware per POV IP address) and I do all my scripting in KiXtart.
Any/All pointers would be greatly appreciated.

You can simplify the command line by takeing advantage of the interpreted wgetrc file which stores setting

Then you can have the following entries stored in the wgetrc file and not have to use the command line switches.

I wanted to update my Vidalia Bundle (Tor, Polipo & Vidalia) but I could NOT find the software I have traditionally used.

I depended upon the Vidalia Bundle which provided Tor and Polipo with the Vidalia GUI.  I don't use "my own copy of Polipo" nor is it my intention to use it with with a Browser.
I took advantage of the Tor & Polipo combination where Vidalia managed the connection and setup and ease of editing of configuration files.  Once I ran Vidalia I could use it with Malzilla  (not Mozilla) or with a WGET command line such as...
WGET  proxy=--execute=http_proxy= Or with any other software that can use a Proxy.  Something that is needed with GeoIP specific sites or sites that memorize and log IP addresses that have already accessed said site.  Getting a new IP was as easy as selecting "New Identity" in Vidalia.  Thus the trio worked symbiotically for the application requirement.
There was no announcement of a change in tor.announce and it should NOT be assumed that we read  .  I am not the only one who uses (has used) the traditional Vidalia Bundle in the fashion I

I have seen personal attack campaigns using numerous systems to perform the attacks such as;  dizum.com, remailer.privacy.at, remailer.paranoici.org and anonymitaet-im-inter.net to name a few.  Te systems were used for privacy b ut were used tol obfuscate one's identity whiles committing the abuse of an individual or on Usenet as a whole.
