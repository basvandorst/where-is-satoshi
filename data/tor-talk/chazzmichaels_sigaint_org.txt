@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser and ahref inside a frameset 
Just looking for some advice... whipped up a quick website and had been
testing it in Firefox on my local machine where it was working great.
Uploaded it to a server running a hidden service, and it seems that the
Tor Browser doesn't honor link targets - ie.  but instead will open links in a new tab?
