@_subject: [tor-talk] Changing IP addresses 
I have a situation where I need to change IP addr, but I also need to be able to use the same IP later when I connect to that specific host again. I am using the Aurora browser bundle. Can I do this or is there another package/product I need to use.
Thanks for any help!

That sounds like what I need to do to keep my bank and credit card co. from challenging me all the time! Can you give me a reference to something that lays out how to set up a VPN to do that?

On this one site I keep getting messages
"Your IP(xx.xx.xx.xx) has been banned by administrator."
I can fix it by going to the Vidalia Control Panel and changing identity, but it is a PITA. Is there any way to stop this from happening in the first place?
Many TIA,

The Vidalia Control Panel has a facility for doing that. No reason to restart anything.
I don't think I am doing any particular thing to get banned. Just the usual stuff you do on a forum type site.
