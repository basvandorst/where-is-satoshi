Oh, I forgot, there are of course many more commands you can send to see what's up with your router. The most telling probably is "setevents bw" which, as long as you do not have any own connections, shows you the amount of bytes you are routing for others.

When Tor hasn't got any network status information about the id you are asking for, it throws an "Unrecognized key" error. My guess is that the router is only in the descriptor list, but not in the network status one. The former seems to have much more router than the latter.

@_subject: Is it me or a bug? 
I am running Tor version 0.2.1.19 and apparently the STREAM_BW event is emitting the read/written bytes the wrong way: In the control-specs it says the syntax is:
     "650" SP "STREAM_BW" SP StreamID SP BytesRead SP BytesWritten CRLF
  This is the same order in which the general bw bytes are emitted and I understand "read" to be the bytes that I downloaded from the network, and "written" the ones I uploaded, but it seems that in the output, the "written" bytes come first.
 Am I misunderstanding something or is this a mistake on Tor's side?

Although I am not sure how it is with a brigde, "getinfo orconn-status" send to the controlport puts out all or connections and their status. Furthermore you can do "setevent orconn" to see connections live as they are opened and closed. Another interesting command, which doesn't work for me as I do not run a bridge, could be "getinfo status/clients-seen" to see a breakdown of countries seen by a bridge.

First you have to enable the control port in torrc:
ControlPort 9051
HashedControlPassword $PASSWORDHASH
The $PASSWORDHASH can be created with:
tor --hash-password $PASSWORD
Then do:
echo "AUTHENTICATE \"$PASSWORD\"\r\nNEWNYM\r\nQUIT\r\n" | netcat localhost 9051
