of the nodes perform a relay and/or routing function via server-to-server or peer-to-peer communications.
Obvious candidates include Tor, I2P and various VPN implementations, as well as IRC.  Less obvious ones might include SMTP (servers), Jabber (servers), VoIP (Skype and SIP servers yes, TeamSpeak/Ventrilo/Mumble no).
OpenNap used server-to-server communications to fan out searches to other OpenNap servers. Not sure if BitTorrent can be considered a network in the truest sense.
Just my 2 cents. :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] VPS Suggestions for Middle Relay 
Hi David --
I'm a bit late to this thread, but you could try lowendbox.com.  They have many good offers for low end VPSes from various providers.  Bear in mind that Tor has voracious appetite for bandwidth; I ran a middle relay for a couple months and had to throttle it to 10Mbit/s to avoid going over the 1TB/month Memory isn't much of an issue for a middle relay, so try to grab as much data  allowance as possible for the cheapest price.
