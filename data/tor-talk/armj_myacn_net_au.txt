Can you tell me why the Tor browser has such a
slow download ? I've reduced the upload speed
but it doesnt make any difference.   Thanks, Jeff

Hi... can you tell me why my download speeds are so slow ?
I've reduced the upload speed to minimum but lately the download speed has been 2-3kbps when downloading movies. It has been 1mbps at times, but its mostly the lower figure.             Regards, Jeff
ps:  please speak english ! I'm not an expert at this
