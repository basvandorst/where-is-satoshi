@_subject: [tor-talk] 33c3 and tor? 
I was made to spontaneously organise one (after I asked a certain
Moritz if there would be one) on day 3 (Thursday), 10pm :
  We currently have hall C.2, which can host ~50 people, but I will try
to organise a larger venue based on the success of tomorrow's meetup.
Best, and hoping to see you there,
