Hi everyone, this is my first post here!
Excuse me if this is not the right place to ask this, I also think this may
have been asked a lot, if that's the case, please direct me.
I want to use Tor to hide the origin IP in WhatsApp. I already have a
method, but I do not know if it is effective:
* With the Tor Browser open, I configured with Tor Browser data the Proxy
socket on my OS W10 that accesses the Internet over Ethernet,
* I connected my Android Smartphone to my W10 WiFi.
* I also have the OrBot on Android, but I do not know if it is effective to
hide my IP to the destination.
It works?
I see in my W10 Chrome that my IP has changed, but I'm not sure my IP will
not leak, for example through the UDP protocol.
Please, how can I use Tor to hide the origin IP in WhatsApp Android?

Em ter, 16 de abr de 2019 às 12:13, Cyaniventer The idea is privacy.
No, hiding the phone number is the easiest and I already have it ready.
Is it enough to hide the IP from the source ???
Could you give me more details?

Em ter, 16 de abr de 2019 às 12:15, Udo van den Heuvel Yes, but in Whatsapp is where everyone is and I'm not counting on a trusted
destination, so I want to protect myself.

Em ter, 16 de abr de 2019 às 12:25, Nathan Freitas Okay, but if you do not want to get caught by MATRIX, you can not put
personal information on your smartphone except a contact list.
the concern is with destination not to discover the origin.

Em ter, 16 de abr de 2019 às 12:33, Cyaniventer Well, my mistake can cost me my life.
My country is one of those who has blocked WhatsApp and dings who tries to
show their abuses. It is repressive, but for some reason the world sees it
with good eyes, perhaps because it is not openly declared socialist, but it
is certainly authoritarian, corrupt and very dangerous and constantly puts
innocents in jail without the slightest humanitarian feeling.
That's why I'm here asking, I'm not sure of anything.
I'll take a look, but what the best current way is the physical protection
how to use public WiFi far.
It's disappointing.

Em ter, 16 de abr de 2019 às 13:35, Cyaniventer Excuse me if I get it wrong, but are you worried about me or the Tor
network? heheheh...
They are not blocking WhatsApp currently, I said they have blocked in the
past. And Tor I think it was never blocked except for some sites like
Interpol, I do not know why. Why???
There is no doubt that there are idiots in power, and the thing is even
worse, we have a "*Big Dog Fight*", some order to block/arrest, then others
order to unblock/free, is a "*Russian Roulette*", TOTAL legal insecurity.
No, the arrest is for those who speak what they do not want.
The goal is to talk with  friends/familie and all other professionals.
Thanks for the tip, but this will isolate me from others in our unique ways
of communicating.
Jailtimeis is for what we speak.
We are breaking records of prisons, here everyone is called bandit for
almost nothing. The repression is very strong. They create a mythological
fugue, such as "bandit", they point the finger at someone and everyone runs
off the poor, it's lynching all the time, we have a genocide in full swing,
it dies more here than Russia and the US can kill together in the war
against ISIS in Syria.
We can use WhatsApp, we can not talk what they do not like!
It would be "How do I hide my whatsapp origin IP from
my government / isp?"
Thank you, I have much to read and study, I thought that someone had
already walked this path and would have the solution more ready.

In fact, our basic need is to communicate anonymously with everyone else by
any means, written and preferably by voice, and that brings us to phones,
WhatsApp and Tor.

I did not mean Windows mobile devices, I'm talking about PC Windows 10 OS.
Does it have to be VirtualBox? The W10 PC OS has the HyperV which is where
the VMs run. Is not HyperV useful?
I searched and saw that VirtualBox also runs on the PC W10 OS.
I think so, which VM would not access the internet?
How would it be?
Do I create a VM, install Android on it (if that's possible), and configure
the VM Proxy with the Tor Socket with Tor open?
What is the VM for? Not to leave vestiges in the HD of the PC?
What is the function of each item?
* VM: Do not leave traces in the HD of the PC?
* VPN: Avoid Government / ISP Tracing?
* Tor: hide IP from source?
Would it be this?
I'm going to test this week, but I think WhatsApp should accept this site.
As anonymous, we do not need permanent or private WhatsApp accounts IDs.
Reliable information would be from WhatsApp (WA) and I did not find them,
or from our tests. I thought about locking the UDP ports on my router and
see if the WA works.
I saw on the WA website that WA uses a proprietary protocol as well.
Yes, we can talk by PMs if needed, but at the moment I do not have much to
talk about, if you have, please PM me.

Em qua, 17 de abr de 2019 às 06:01, Cyaniventer I did not understand the question.
Of course, I am an activist and I want to reveal the crimes of my
government to our people who are drugged and impenetrated with false
information, hatred and revolt against themselves. The government puts the
people against the people.
And in the open hours, of course, talk to friends/family.
This is true if they do not capture the destination of the messages or if
they are the destination. Hence comes the need for anonymity.
Okay, so how will I communicate? How can I publish hidden facts and do my
Yes. The term Professionals includes Government / ISP!
Not all friends are trustworthy, I'd rather not take this risk and
anonymity also protects friends and family!
I would be very honored and proud to be "someone" I believe I have the
skills for this. : )
But at the moment I'm very confused about what the exact function and need
of each element (WhatsApp, VM, VPN, TOR ...) for this my goal, I feel the
solution will come from an idea of how to associate the minimum necessary.
I have my notions but a little confused, could you tell what you think
about the function of each of this element that I listed? That would bring
me more confidence.
Perhaps a diagram, a flow chart, a drawing of a network could bring a lot
of clarity.

Em qua, 17 de abr de 2019 às 06:04, Cyaniventer Many thanks for the warning!
I think that:
Threaten a anonymous he does not even know where it is does not yield
results and does not produce motivation.
It is a good observation. Considering this, as anonymous, some care should
be taken if you create the WA account by this site.
* After creation, let it go a long time without activity, if the account is
still there, you can start using it.
* Do not use this account at all times or as a personal account, use it
only when you need it and take care of it considering it can be stolen.
* Never allow WA access to your personal contacts.
* The data is in the mobile of the account and not in the servers of the
WA, we can delete them after generating them.
* And consider that you can find the thief by your IP and he will not find
it interesting the upset of the game, and also the thief can be stolen too!
What do you think?

Mirimir, my friend!  {|: )
I was very discouraged but these yours last information made me very
excited. I took a little look at the riseup, you are one of mine !!!
I'm confused, I need some time to digest this, but I'll try to follow the
path you suggested.
We need to do some cleaning here and start from the beginning and follow it
step by step, can you help me along the way? If yes, how do you prefer, by
the list or by PM?

Em qui, 18 de abr de 2019 às 00:43, Cyaniventer Okay, using it directly is what I do today, but I would like to increase my
security so I can talk more.
Yes, for my safety and for their safety.
Yes, that would work if I were an anonymous to be discovered, but that does
not work if you are a person observed as Julian Assange whose possible
contacts, friends and family are also observed.
Okay, thanks again, I already do something similar to this assuming some
risk because I am currently out of my country for this purpose, but I have
the need for publications/voip addressed to certain
people/professionals/groups as well, that is the point here.
Today I feel proud because my 10-year job has produced a turning point in
the Government of my country in the direction I worked for it.
We are in transition and there are still a lot of corrupt remnants.

Incredible, very good!
Thank you very much, I'll test that.
My concern is how I anonymously locate the destination to talk to him, the
phone number solves this issue, that's what WhatsApp does.
