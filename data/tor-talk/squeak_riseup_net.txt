@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor -> VPN  Clarification 
Relative newbie here, and I was wondering if someone could help me with
something please. I keep seeing people describing connections to the Tor
and is VPN connections in the following two ways:
Tor -> VPN
VPN -> Tor
So if I fire up Tunnelblick, connect to my VPN provider and then open
TBB which of the above does this describe?  And also, is there a
recommended way of connecting these two technologies?
Another thing I've noticed is in the Tunnelblick client that there is an
option to connect to a Socks5 proxy, this suggests to me that I can send
the VPN connection through the Tor network.  But I am confused as to why
one would want to do this, and what the benefits/disadvantages might be?
Really appreciate any help you guys could give me!

Hi Guys,
Thanks for the prompt replies, they are really helpful.  The image you
posted Bill Berry was especially illuminating, thanks!
So VPN -> Tor is what I'm currently doing with Tunnelblick and TBB, but
could somebody detail how and with which programs you would achieve Tor
-> VPN please?    I'm having a little trouble visualising how that would
A follow-up question about the Tunnelblick set up, if someone does
directly attack my connection and somehow manages to crack the VPN
encryption they are only going to see that I'm using Tor.  Is that correct?
Thanks again!
