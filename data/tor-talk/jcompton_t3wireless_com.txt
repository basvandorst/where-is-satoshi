@_subject: Google messages 
I frequently get messages from Google that they are unable to process my search.  The message indicates that the Google server is receiving automated requests from my network, suggesting that my computer or network is infected.  Anyone getting similar messages? Could an infected server be responsible?  Is all traffic pass through?
Just curious,
