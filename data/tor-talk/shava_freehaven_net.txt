@_subject: Could i use tor to login Paypal? 
Paypal has a long history of being a pain in the tush about this:
I have known them to do lovely things like freeze the account of a small NGO's fundraiser event because suddenly the paypal account of the NGO got too much money in donations in too short a time, and they thought that was suspicious and wouldn't allow the NGO to withdraw any until they appealed -- so the event had to be cancelled because the money to pay for the band, whatever, was in limbo.
It seems unlikely it's because of your Tor use, but we'll look for other anecdotes that might lead us to believe this to be the case.

Or, I could take 5 minutes and be proactive...:)  I just sent to paypal's contact us - protections/privacy/security/account privacy address:
I could have been more precise, but to dash this off in a few minutes and within their 1000 character limit...

@_subject: reporter from The Economist in Thailand seeks help 
If someone proficient with helping a newbie set up Tor et al on XP to get by national firewalls wants to personally assist Peter Collins from The Economist set up his machine, please email me, and I'll hook you up?
I hear he has skype, but he doesn't have direct access to  for downloads, and I don't know what other mirrors he might have blocked.
he says:
Ben Sutherland of the Economist wrote an article on Tor for their upcoming "technology quarterly" edition, and when he heard that Peter was having ever more problems with the national firewalls in Thailand, he asked if I could get Peter a little setup help.

@_subject: Block directory authorities, is it possible? 
You are correct that this is a vulnerability now.  We're developing a blocking resistance strategy that should ameliorate this risk.  Perhaps one of the developers will comment on this further.

@_subject: seeking boston area office volunteer 
Hi!  I'm seeking a volunteer in the Boston area who can do administrivial bits (data entry, running reports, thank-you emails for donations), possibly a little light scripting (to save data entry and such), and various grunt work for a good cause, here at the new home office in Somerville, MA.
We're on a couple bus lines, and I keep weird enough hours to accomodate most schedules.  Bunches of stuff could be done telecommuting.
High reliability and trustworthiness required, good English language skills (and other languages welcome!) and computer literacy.
Office comes with small friendly dog, in case you are allergic.
Please contact me directly if you'd like to help out the Tor Project in this less technical, but highly necessary and useful way!
