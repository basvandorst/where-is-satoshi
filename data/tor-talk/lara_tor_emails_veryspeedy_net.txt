Fascinating article.
A group speculates about some people. Their method might be as
rudimentary as locating a blond person in a part of the city where all
people have black hair. The method won't be disclosed.
The group publishes the data. One might argue that is a good thing based
on motives, a nice Kantian approach. Yet, by doing this, one
deliberately ignores it is an act of bullying, no different that putting
nude pictures of the ex-girlfriend "because she's a slut".
Given the situation is quite volatile in the region, with more than one
civil war going nearby, knowing the rule of law is quite weak and that
weapons are easily available, the ONLY reasonable action is for those
people to leave as fast as possible and probably as far as possible.
Which, in turn, proves not only that the first group is right in naming
the spies, but also that bullying is the way to do things.
This way a rather silly and quite unpleasant gesture becomes one more
step on the way back into the Middle Ages.
Sad. But this is the way humans are.

The answer is "we don't know".
Repressive regimes use almost perfect tools like rubber hose cryptography.
Also repressive regimes have a rather good control over the information.

It's funny how people reference books without even bothering to read. In
1984 crime is rampant. Not only the main characters are involved in
illicit activities, but the Part has to have an investigative branch
just to curb this.
Also the use of the word slaves is just to make an emotional statement.
Would slaves be aware of their slave status once ALL are in the same
position? A society of slaves? slaves to what? Abrahamic rethorics have
more than a millennia of pointing how people are slaves to money,
fashion whatever and the only solution is accepting to be a slave for
the preacher's own imaginary friend.
Who? When? Where? Based on what?
Crime is what the one/ones in power deem unacceptable.
Using the same site I come up with "Freedom of speech and freedom of the
press in Denmark"[1]:
and hate speech/racism, which are restricted by the Danish penal code.
Like most other countries, Denmark also forbids publishing classified
material harmful to state security, copyright-protected material without
permission and revealing trade secrets in the civil law.
I have nothing against you. I do not even know you. I have never been to
Denmark. And I admired the king when he refused to interfere with the
press freedom. But Denmark, like any other country, is far from the free
speech. Let's say the speech is more free there than in other places.
Child abuse is common in what is generally known as "the civilized
world". An adult, ANY adult can shout at a child, can hit a child, can
be brutal, violent, aggressive, dominant. Children are bodily harmed
from a very young age ranging from mutilation, sedentarism, and bad
eating habits. Sometimes it can be not only fun to play jokes on the
children, but it can be mandatory: do that or you will burn in hell for
an eternity. How about theocracies or the places where having a prepuce

So there were demons. Now they are bankers. And they do crazy rituals
for reaping souls. That turned into excel pages and profits. After the
uncertainty of the 19th century christianity seems to be back stronger
than ever, only with a small change of vocabulary.
Not even the fairy tales with the bankers are new. Good
christians/muslims can not touch interest. Only the local temple, be it
a church of morsque. Jews were allowed to do next to nothing. Even
ownership was restricted without a baptismal certificate. So helping the
economy thrive by giving credit was one of the last things they can do
besides than lying in the road waiting to die. This way a smart move
assuring the survival of the individual and his family becomes the
capital sin of not dying fast enough. After the Holocaust, it is less
acceptable to say Jew. So let us say banker. *Everybody knows Jews own
the banks* anyway.
Back to reality. Banker is also the nice teller who is doing overtime to
feed the children. The teller has to accept the strict banking dress
code. And the hippie across the street, getting a nice tan in shorts and
sandals, can feel superior to *them drones*.

from Twitter
malte at wk3.org:
I wonder at which point making the same advertisment turns into spam.
I wanted to experience "the freedom" a couple of months ago. So I went
ahead and made a few accounts, long deleted. If I recall well, only two
or three servers have .onion addresses. Both services (or pods) I have
tested use plain http for the .onion address. Anyway, it is quite
pointless, because once you are in you get a bunch of connections in the
regular Internet, including the main server which should have been
mirrored on the .onion address.
At first I had the vague impression that diaspora is an idiot magnet.
Few activity and the regular conspiracy nut slash armchair social
supported anarchist crowd. Maybe it is just a matter of taste. I have no
idea if nobody cared about me because I identified as male. But anyway,
that was the only plus: no harrassment.
Later I have told myself that is because of the number of users. Users
who are on twitter slash facebook anyway and seem to need the mirroring
functions. And the few posts that are not about programming or the
revolution set up to start yesterday are like 3-4 months apart.
I would have ignored the thread. Usually I filter out this kind of
whining. And than:
Roman Mamedov:
Actually at the time, 2015, there are only two alternatives: mainstream
or not. The mainstream is where the people are. Meaning Facebook or
Twitter. Facebook is a walled garder. Meaning you are either in or out.
With twitter, just checking the user's page from time to time is enough
to keep you updated without bothering without wasting time jumping
through the twitter's flaming hoops of identificating over and over again.
Not mainstream means wasting far more time than with the above and
meeting the same thousand nutcases who have opened at least one account
on every service.
A nice promise. The promise was all users have got. And it was a good
sale. Over $200k[1]! It is sooo decentralised you can't even migrate an
account from one server to another. At least it is working. But the team
deserted and it working on the next moneymaking promise.
It was supposed to be the twitter killer. Twitter without limits. Only
that the twitter guys set the drastic limits and still failed a few
times. Only a fraction of the twitter trafic with the twitter
restrictions in place would most probably kill the status.net. But
status.net is already dead. The sole developer has moved to make the
facebook killer. Cute.
The facebook killer. Or at least that was the promise. Not very well
polished. But one is reminded of the sole main developer and limited
Probably there are more born dead projects. All with the same thousand
of users.
One has to love the double standard: facebook wouldn't be here based on
one developer. Yet counting the names involved with the necropolis of
disfunctional social webs, the developers I far fewer than the preacher
and prophets against the scarry mainstream in which they can't seem to
fit anyway. So it probably makes sense to get on kickstart and sell the
GPLed Pinterest.
And the wheel is turning. Less than a generation again Miguel de Icaza
was runing the same scam. Give the penultimate Windows experience. That
is their trade. I respect that. My issue is with the masses. How can an
Outlook 95 clone, written in the days of Outlook 97 become better and
more original than an OS X?
Take Yahoo Messenger. It started as a lame ICQ clone. In 2005 there was
voice support. By 2009 there was webcam support. The so called free
world kept feeling good about SIP. Instantbird/Tor Messenger still does
not support audio and video.
So call it a capitalist white conspiracy because the users have NO choice.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Privacy Pass from Cloudflare, and the CAPTCHA problem 
It would mean to lose the privacy or anonymity in exchange for receiving
the same shit, only in smaller portions. "Users can now use the Privacy
Pass browser extension to reduce the number of challenge pages presented
by Cloudflare." 99.98% is smaller, yet indistinguishable from the user
stand point. But it is an excellent position for cloudflare. They could
track the user, as nobody has examined their configurations AFAIK, and
lower the load on their servers.
What is worse: the appeal to authority: "researchers from Royal Holloway
and the University of Waterloo". Who? What is their track record? Are
they known for work in privacy? Waterloo is not rated in the first 200
universities, so maybe they are not the best in the lot. For example,
Roger Dingledine's name was associated with MIT which is both in Top 5
Universities and a private institution.
Going on the site things are even blurrier: no reference to any audit.
Even the authors have no idea: "In the near future, we hope to publish a
paper detailing the security goals that we hope for our protocol to
achieve." Near future is the optimist of sometimes. Yet it is a state
university, so that depends on the student doing the research. Missing
one grant request and they are gone.
That also lights some more bad aspects. When someone using Tor will be
in some Syrian jail, all the support coming from Cloudflare and Royal
Holloway and the University of Waterloo will be a mention in some dry
research paper published behind some paywall.
And Cloudflare is a hypocritical corporation just like any other:
"Cloudflare believes that the web is for everyone." Hence the need to
activate JavaScript for a whole site.

Borders are usually lines drawn on a map by old, usually white, males

crossed by the said line.
Countries are the surfaces delimited by those lines. On maps. Hence the
country can do shit.
What you probably meant is government. But the government is also an
abstraction. It is a list of names on a piece of paper.
What might help shaping your argument is realizing there are people
Try something like "no politician who wants to be reelected".
Proving a negative is also going to prove pretty damn hard.
Anyway, your discourse is a hysterical one as you conveniently avoid to
define the emotionally loaded terms of "freedom of speech" and
"privacy". You also seem to have no clear idea about who or what is the
subject, again, conveniently omitting it. For one, there are a lot of
places, "countries", where the privacy of the spy agencies is protected
up to the death penalty even if that is outlawed. Or so the people
opposing the government say.
And if you do not write in the vein of the aberrant 18th or 19th century
European philosophers, looking for a "perfect" freedom of speech and
privacy, than you already have that in the States. They are perfectible,
certainly. But without having an idea what should be solved, you end up
like all sorts of revolutionaries, meaning killing people marked as
class enemies.
Perfect freedom would imply a monotheistic god stance. The moment you
have a community of gods you start having limits to that freedom. What
you should ask yourself is "whom does this restriction help?" and "do I
need this restriction?" Of course, there are many more questions to ask
your self, but this is probably a good starting point.
As you have probably remarked reaching for a solution is not an easy
task. And starting on the path towards the solution implies the effort
to identify the restrictions instead of wallowing in the warm and smelly
waters of convenience. Limiting yourself to some concepts turned into
baseball bats to rise "an against the system" gang will only help the
individuals in power expand their powers.
And yes, the legal restrictions change over time because the individuals
that compose a society, including the society named government, do
change. As a football team during a big game they change as individuals,
but they also can change their minds.
Your remark about "sometimes drastically" is cute. But completely
useless. Given enough time ALL restrictions are drastic.
See above. Identify the issues. It is pretty much like the security
models or the bug solving in software development. And I assume the
subscribers of this list are fairly familiar with these concepts.
"We" is a populist way of catching the attention. Which is in sync with
the radiating emotion from the entire post. It will greatly help moving
from emotion to reason. Sure, it will gain you less friends and
followers. But the people liking other people for this sort of discourse
are usually good only at pitchfork gatherings or for burning crosses.
So who is we? You and your husband or wife? You and your parents? You
and your other selfs? You write from one email account. Let the other
sock puppets express themselves. How about avoiding the weasel consensus
and just say "I"?
And you are only one. And the current political system, at least for the
last 3000 years, is based on majorities. But at some of the issues that
bother you were also born because of fuzzy emotional concepts and half
baked solutions designed to show that "we" do make a change. In the case
of goverments, the word is reform. Do not be mislead by form, it is the
same concept.
The excellent part, and I am grateful to that, is that the Tor
