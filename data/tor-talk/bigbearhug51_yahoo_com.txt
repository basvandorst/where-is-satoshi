@_subject: [tor-talk] SMS app for droid 
Is there a decent SMS app that works on droid which can have all traffic funneled through Tor ok?? Once upon a time I believe I had TextPlus setup on an iOS device and seemed like it used HTTPS traffic to talk to their servers, and Tor was working with it as far as I could tell. Is there anything like this for droid?? This would be a rooted 2.3.7 device.

TextPlus is an external company/app that lets you login to their system and send SMS.? The connection I think is HTTPS based from the device, and their system handles SMS delivery.
The apps exist for iOS and android - just wanting to know if there's anything else out there like this that can be router through Tor, something that would have an HTTP/HTTPS based connection to begin with I suppose.? I'm not knowledgeable enough to know exactly what I'm looking for, unless I've already got the understanding?
