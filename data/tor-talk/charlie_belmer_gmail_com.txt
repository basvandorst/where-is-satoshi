@_subject: [tor-talk] Will Tor affect Internet Explorer? (newbie question) 
Have any really simple and intuitive videos or articles been created you
guys know of? Something like online anonymity for dummies?
I think all the technical information is excellent, and really good for
folks with more in depth knowledge of the internet and it's ecosystems.
Unfortunately, I don't have a good link to a really simple explanation I
could give to people who only know "I connect to the internet with IE
through ATT" which would give them a simple way to understand what is
happening, and how to avoid common pitfalls. It is something I would love
to be able to give out to folks.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What's better than Tor for criminals? 
I always took it to mean using malware infected hosts, rootkits, and C&C
servers to do the dirty work, which not only makes you hard to trace, but
can also point investigations at the infected host.
