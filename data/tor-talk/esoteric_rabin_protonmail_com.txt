@_subject: [tor-talk]  metric moving theoretical attack, what I don't know 
Hello List,
not so sure if this have been discussed before:
(vulnerable directory fetching/host security)
Run a tor network from scratch with no dogdyness, with
middle.nodes, exit nodes and bridges. Control a directory
server. Run no virus or other attacks in it. Now having
a mathematical model that can see node/metric being never
connected with the real tor network. How to identify the
wrong directory server, except from having good starting
defaults. (that is, sane DNS, sane provider)
node junk1 is active and sane from view junk view
node junk1 is inactive and sane from view view
attacks now:
isolation (done with saneness)
more nodes (directory server)
more traffic (run vulnerable tor software)
How to ensure sane-ness of directory server?
Does it make sense to measure metric to other nodes?

@_subject: [tor-talk] using ptrace to defend tor 
Hello List,
I thought about defending tor with ptrace().
For people, that cannot use yama sysctl, write
a knob tor_announce_ptrace_check()
Then, before tor_init() check with standard code
from silvio caesare example.
Later renew check in periodic_events or in event_loop.
The check must always fail, when uid less then 101.
This way, a user without root, can be informed, whether
the machine traces him.
