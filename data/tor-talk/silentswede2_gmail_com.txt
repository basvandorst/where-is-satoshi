@_subject: [tor-talk] Freenet and hidden services 
I'm fairly new at Tor, and this is my first time on a mailing list,
so if there's a better place to ask, let me know.  Are there any
plans, long-term or short, for augmenting Tor with Freenet-style
resilient, distributed, encrypted hosting in place of the current
hidden-service model?  I understand that they are different projects
with different goals, but in the wake of the Freedom Hosting fiasco it
seems that the idea has merit.  Certainly both sides would benefit?
Freenet is not always anonymous, and hidden services are not always
resilient, but together...  What are the pros and cons of this idea,
and what stands in the way of implementing it?  Just curious.
  Cheers!  Thanks for your time.
