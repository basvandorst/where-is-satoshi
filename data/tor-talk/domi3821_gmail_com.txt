Google is checking if your IP is a Tor Exit Node, no matter from where you
want to connect

There are proxies where you don't need to verify yourself.
Tor should be a normal thing, sure it's anonymizing but it can help a lot.

Tor/darknets in general has a bad reputation among the people who did not
spend the time to see why tor is important and not a tool for criminals.
Everyone i meet who knows what tor is uses it for drugs, not for anonymity.
Thats just sad.

Well tor is generally not a fast network so generally no one notices. Or am
i wrong?

Hi Justin,
I just tried connecting with meek-google and it works fine so I would
assume that your IT department has a proxy running which is filtering some
URLs. Try to connect with meek-amazon, works fine on my schools network.
Best Regards
