@_subject: [tor-talk] Getting Involved in the Tor Project 
Hi all, I'd like to get some more information on volunteering with and in the Tor Project. The website seems to be heavily geared towards developer and running nodes. However I'm not a developer and I'm going to be running my own node soon.
There is a section on the website for volunteering with other things:
- Create a presentation that can be used for various user group meetings around the world.
- Create a video about the positive uses of Tor, what Tor is, or how to use it. Some have already started on Tor's Media server, Howcast, and YouTube.
- Create a poster around a theme, such as "Tor for Freedom!"
- Create a t-shirt design that incorporates "Congratulations! You are using Tor!" in any language.
- Spread the word about Tor at a symposium or conference and use these Tor brochures in PDF and ODG format and translated to at least ten different languages as conversation starter.
These are all nice things and I've done some of them, but that's me doing it on my own. How would I actually get involved in the Tor Project itself short of being hired as an employee?

I'm sorry to be nitpicky, but this doesn't answer my question. These are all things that I can do as an individual, but how do I join the Tor Project organization as a official contributor/volunteer? For example, last year I did a presentation at the OpenSUSE Conference on using containers to build .onion services. This year I would like to do something similar at the HCPP19 Hacker Congress. I would like to be able to say that I am with the Tor Project as opposed to saying, I'm just some guy who experiments with Tor on his own. I hope that makes sense.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Building Tor Browser on ARM 
Hi all,
I'm attempting to build Tor Browser on an ARM64 machine. However, the install tool requires that you download some x64 packages which of course breaks the build. The following has details where it is breaking:  Any suggestions for a workaround?
