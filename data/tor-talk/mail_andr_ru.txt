Yes, it is, Ms Croft
People have the right to choose what they need and what they do not.
And the control by all state or public organizations is primarily
commercial interest, I've lot of dirty facts.
This is the control of the elite over the ego. To truly become an
egalitarian society, one must give everyone a reliable anti-espionage
tool. Tor does this, but still not reliable for the layman.
But the network is the lowest level. The society needs a means of
communication (not just chat, it requires an onion video with reliable
authorization) and crypency. Until now, I don't know of a crypency
that would by default be strictly used with Tor, show me. Group
signing in BCN is the good direction, but it is not enough. Direct
network connections make the user vulnerable to special services of
elites, of evil bosses.
Tell me please, if there is a centralized blacklist Tor nodes, like
spam blacklist for email. My list works well, especially with obfs4
bridges, but I'm often not sure about my assessment. In addition, I
have to manually carry it from the device to the device, it would be
good to automate it

It is good decision, but not working well. I'd lot of problem in the
past until I filled my personal blacklist. It would be nice to load
the torrc over the URL, so as not to look for where to put it, where
to put it. I use three OS on two other's owners computers: Slax, Remux
and Muzdie 7 and 10
10x4in4, got it. But of two evils choose the least

slow down not so hard guys!
i mean "bad" node for me, for user, not for onionwork.
i'm rookie in using the tor, and have some TORubles, which can be
studied to improve the subject. first of all, you must reading the
Interface by JRaskin all the time. i'm rookie for tor, but have some
skills in computing, otherwise I would not have managed with the
So, most often this is
 1) very bad/slow connection with/across  the node
 2) captcha
 3) blacklist
 4) traffic redirection to hostile territory
theOnion should provide to lamer a convenient interface for fast
editing the ExcludeNodes list and method to share it. with onion URL
for example.
Q: by the way, why onion need dot-onion for URL?
     is it possible used just hash without dot?
And another one news: under linux (opera and chrome) ip-api.com
showing my real ip not every time. So far I have no idea why

actually, we have best of the best tool for secure talking and meeting.
strictly from peer to peer.
why the tor-talk community does not using the subject for this conversation?
I propose a new topic, so what are you use for the torus except the browser?
And make a modest contribution:

I'm talking about this, and repeat:
 1) bad connection to some node, because "goodguys" to block it, or owned it.
 2) captcha/blacklist, because "goodguys" generated lot of bad traffic
 3) forged DNS by "goodguys", using dnscrypt is not simple
 4) turn traffic to hostile territory, where is "goodguys" could control it.
It is necessary to give to lamer the opportunity to manage this.

it's easy to understand
this was not done for the special  ists works
who like to organize seminars and parties with the exchange of secret
keys under beer on the beach
like prefix 02 for changed wifi macs
but guys!
"get the same level of protections"
"YOUR IPASS WILL STILL BE SEEN [at here for example], DO NOT DO IT!"
it is not the same.
does someone reads those faq?
thank you for hiding the "expert bundle", now I understand why.

I've poor slow english and apologize for any possible inaccuracies. Who is
I mean the Tor has better design for secure data exchange at this moment,
and any "Talk" can be build on the onion at several days, even hours. It is
a surprise me almost complete absence of special (using onion address)
applications. Most famous the TorChat has last edited in 2012. Nobody needs
something or what?
I want to draw the community's attention to IPFS.io . This excellent
technology could be used for the new Tor. Obviously, she has a strong lack
of secrecy, for another hand for Tor would be very useful to get more
properties of P2P. It would be great to combine them. On RAM-fs can work
fast enough.
if I would be have a copy of the file from another Tor-user, I do not need
to go outside

So, what's different? it's even worse, the torchat at least my tor
launches, but the ricochet has a built-in, and an ancient one. automatic
upgrade is not present.
not present cli-version - with such it is necessary to begin and build over
it, imho
and for such a chat it is absolutely necessary to have a powerful local
database of messages with categories and groups as into mailbox. Otherwise,
after a few megabytes messages, is a useless thing
you need to do it yourself (tm)
thanks for answers
