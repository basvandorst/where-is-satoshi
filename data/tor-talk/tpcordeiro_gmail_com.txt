Hi everybody. First of all, sorry if it has already been explained,
I'm new here.
I would like to know how to change the circuit that Tor is using (like
the option "Use a New Identity" at Vidalia control panel). But I want
to make this only using command line, running Linux. Is that possible?
Thanks in advanced
