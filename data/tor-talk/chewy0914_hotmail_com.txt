@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Security Issues??? 
I just downloaded tor and am trying to figure it out.
I noticed that all the links I see are 16keys long followed by .onion.
Couldn't someone(person/company/government/other) just generate every
16 digit combination possible then try to connect to them?
Is there another layer I haven't seen yet or is that the case?
I've been trying random 16key.onion sites.
Most of the time the browser does nothing. The browser has every now and then started loading then I get an unable to
connect page.
Does that mean I found a page/site?
Is there a layer of security getting in the way? Something else?
Could this be a security issue?
16Key.onion Generator+ Auto search program?
After trying and seeing how fast I found sites if that's what I found.
Is the level of security too low for any real security?
AES encryption has lots of possible keys?
You most likely wont have to try them all to find the one key???
.onion sites.....many sites???
Random search?
How many do you have to search to find an active one?
Is the .onion key limited to English keys+numbers?+symbols?
Would it be more secure to give the option of different site address lengths?
Also would it be more secure to require letters/symbols/other from(all)many different languages
in the address?
(Side note:) If anyone could provide me with an intro to Tor/onion I would appreciate it.
Securing my system/sites/and anything else I should need....Thanks

I've been randomly generating keys to try to stumble upon sites.
I'm trying now  a list of supposedly current or past .onion sites.
I've noticed a pattern in all the addresses.
I don't know what it is or what it could be used for so I'm not sure if i should to share for all to read.
Will someone let me know if there is somewhere else I could submit this?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Pattern In Tor Addresses 
I started by trying to figure out tor(find websites and so on.)
Noticed there are 16 keys per address.
Almost all I've seen have at least 1 number.
I then started generating keys. They were hit and miss to even try to connect.
I've now looked at the combinations of numbers and letters and have found a pattern.
Below is they address changed into numbers.
Letters changed into numbers starting with a-1 through z-26.
The numbers are the numbers 1.2.3......
I then added all them together.
Then divided the totals by 2.
8 2 4 2 13 23 19 20 18 6 11 12 2 19 9 6        174 /2 87  /2 43.5

They all seem to at some point end in a half number???
If anyone knows a key generator that i can program with parameters as defined below for more trying please let me know.
16 key gen, letters and numbers,(possible define numbers below1/5-1/3 the total output)
Set key to be a multiple 1+--* of a half number. and maybe others parameters.

The reason I had thought the numbers may matter is that if I modify or
create an address that has the same total value as an existing one I saw Tor almost every time
Tor tries to connect.
When the key generator I've been trying produced an address 90% of the time the browser does nothing.
I have the generator set to 16key length numbers and letters.
One thing I noticed is it outputs addresses more often with more numbers
than the active sites I've seen.

So again thinking about how tor is secure and how it could be bypassed....
So the output last ip is shown right?
Since the government agencies can get into other government buildings.
Placing bugs in ultra secure places.
Wouldn't it be easy for someone to get someone in to that out put ip.
Place something in it and then go to all the other ip's that come into that one?
And again going into the other ip's?

@_subject: [tor-talk] So I Guess Tor Could Never Be Secure No Matter What 
Tor is hardware right?
Going from your house to your service provide?
So all anyone needs to do and it seems the US is probably already doing it is
just collect all the traffic or all the traffic that can't be read going into
any service provider or hub or wherever.
And then decrypt it or just match the data encrypted or not as it goes anywhere.
LOL- all data is just data who cares if you can read it.
It's the same data being sent  001 goes all the way through as 001 right?
So isn't encrypted data easier to track since there isn't as much?
Here are a few thought on a hardware.  Graphics and some other random stuff.
Life Like Graphics
Any character model- with maybe few changes.
Can be done.
So first thing first what makes a character in a game movie/other not look
take xbox(original) quality game??
What was the pixel resolution that a character could support?
Not the poly's the skin???
A few steps back Nintendo 64?
Mario 64- why didn't he look real????
Current characters????
Random starting point.
Take an Hd Picture of a person.
Zoom into the pixel level.
Look at the pixel distribution.
Look a the colors that are in the pixels.
Compare the pixel distribution to that of any character.
Look and see if there are any straight lines in natural pictures vs
Look at the eyes. Are they white or tinted to the color of the iris?
took me 5-10 minutes to change eyes on a 512x512 .dds texture to make the
eyes look real.
NFL 15 from the news is taking pictures of players to make models.
Do the look perfectly real? If no why?
Examples are:
What is the difference between the nearly life like cg in movies vs games as
it apperars on your computer screen?
Both are pixels. Max res of your screen.
in the process of starting to put frames from a movie into autodesk and
make myself a skin for a model that will look like any high end cg from
a new movie.
If any game doesn't look right a point of possible increase would be to take a photo capture of the game and compare the pixels to what you want it to look like in a picture from life or other animated material and look at the pixels. They Are The Sp any game that doesn't look exact to life you have your way to make it that way and if you can't you have something that is already that way..
Anyone like portals??
They were able to take 2d pixels like any other game and make a hole in the
game to another place.
would think if it is only pixels and you can see depth in a 3d environment in a game you may be able to make anything on your screen look like your looking through a door/window.
Doorway in a game vs a doorway in front of you.
3d movies whole movie setting in front of the screen?
Background/actors all.
I'll add more when i do.
Think cos-play to a whole new level.
You want to be batman....
There's the costume, there's autodesk, there's the character skin file.
I AM Batman.----------
any of you make cg movies for fun. try doing a screen grab of the pixels or autodesking a character from a movie and see how close to a Pixar or other movie you can get that will render in real time on an xbox one.
 Any of you do photo editing.
I upped a res of a photo with image scaling it took some time....
Then I took the image back down to its original res.
The pixel quality was low.
Why that way????
I could zoom that higher res image out until it became a lower res image on my
I haven't down it but I assume I could just zoom the whole image or parts
down then do a screen capture keeping the high res quality in a lower res
There is a way to make faster Gpu's now that use less energy and produce
less heat.
Power usage/gflops mobile GPU vs desktop GPU
gtx 780m tdp 100
2528 gflops
GTX 780 250
3977 gflops
2x gtx 780m tdp 200
5056 gflops
3x gtx 780m tdp 300
7584 gflops
What would the tdp and how fast would a card be that has 4 mobile chips
instead of 2
desktop one?

@_subject: [tor-talk] So I Guess Tor Could Never Be Secure No Matter What 
In my last message I alluded to what made me apply my thought to the hardware of the internet provider but
included a bit extra instead of modifying the material.
I have decided to clarify the material that I did submit though.
Being not necessarily in line with the porting being the hardware.
To attempt clarify:
What causes something to look real?
I took a dds files and took colors from images of real life objects
and applied them to the image in the dds file. Replacing similarly toned pixels in the cg image with colors from the real life image.  It took about 20 minutes to do the ares I accomplished. After which the areas looked more life like. I didn't change the model or the resolution of the image. However I did increase the resolution later on with having the result of
 a cleaning character at higher and lower game quality settings. The change in resolution seemed to have no noticeable affect on the performance of my system.
What I decided from this there should be a means by which to make imagery character/scenes/other that are fully representative to life. One example to which I noticed, as well as others may have is cg eyes. They don't seem to be real in cg characters. I was able to satisfactorily created life like eyes from pulling colors directly of the eyes of a high res picture of an actress.
When I extracted the colors at the pixel level I noticed that the whites
 in the eye were not what but a shade of the color of the iris. So what I'm stating is that if the colors of life were sampled and those colors accurately applied to a character/object or other the resulting image (3d/2d) would represent the coloration of which we call life. From examining the color
 pallet from a living portrait I believe the colors variation and base coloration do not exist as are applied to cg in life. A low res picture of a person 512x512 pixels still looks like a person becasue of the colors
used in each pixel. If you up the res to 1024x1024 the person might look clearer but
the person is still the same amount of the picture.
5x5in at 512x512 and 5x5in at 1080x1080 person in both pictures is 3x2 in.
You most likely will be able in both to easily tell it is a person and it is the same person
in both pictures.
Pulling colors textures from the environment like autodesk which may or may not do it well
could be a way to get the look it seems games keep striving for.
(I took a picture of real steps and replaced the steps image and the steps that were
put in looked real.
This began me wondering all we see on the screen is a set number of pixels
1080p or that of your screen. A nice animated character in a movie such as The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is really only the number of pixels on your screen as the max it can support. Regardless of the resolution that the animation studio created the model in. That could imply I could
 be able to remove frames a movie and create for myself a model of that After which I found the software autodesk  which may be able to perform that task.
With finding all of this it makes my question with those in the field who deal with such all the time why haven't they been able to discover that and apply it. It would seem when a magazine does the changes of cg to a model they can do it so that real life is added to with real looking cg.
With forth with the texture level that any system can handle if the colors were altered to life pallet would that not make the cg object look real and possibly better as a whole?
One example being I was working with an image of Laura Croft from the new game.
If the color pallet were altered to solely life found colors how much more real would the character instantly look? Forgoing that shaping of the characters figure would be needed as well.
Which may be easily accomplished by applying pixel distribution of a living person to the model.
Or combinations there of. Other random thought. 3d currently can be produced 3d inside of 3d on a screen.
A door you can look through in a game looks as though you are looking through a door in real life being retaliative to the view of the This being solely represented in pixels which are placed in a 2 dimensional row. Is it not that 3d viewing should be producable by means
 that allow viewing of 3d in the dame manner of the person looking at the screen?
 rows that are 3d why is it that 3d coming out or into the screen is not
 being down to?  It seems to be doable in another environment. It should
 be so that we could look
at our screen and see that we were looking down a tunnel. Or that the entirety of the game is outside of the screen. One example be a portal in a portal in the game Portals.
To clarify more if life accurate images are the goal, That has already been accomplished by
any picture displayed digitally.
And it could go that if that accuracy is the goal the only source needed with others being possible
could be a picture of life ,as well if need be multiple others, to extract the symetry of life from a source of pixels. Those provided the exact shape formation and more of the object wanting to be produced.
As for the way zooming in or out of an image seemed to affect the quality, I submitted that for those who may have a better grasp or means of which
 I don't to test to see if that actually allows a higher quality to be produced in a smaller format than by other means. As well as a possibly faster way to shrink an image than the current means of processing the image down to a smaller size.  Lastly noted: the portion showing the hardware was a side note instead of making a second
post comparing the performance of multiple mobile gpu's to a single desktop gpu.
The figures seem to show that possibly 2 mobile gpu's on 1 desktop card would use less energy produce less heat and provide more computational power than a single desktop gpu.
When then made me wonder that if 2 desktop gpu's can fit onto one desktop card. What would it be if 4 mobile gou's were put onto one card?

As long as Tor is secure enough for that.
As in 2 connections to tor?
Not sure how to set that up or program that.
Each doing a request for the data?
And collecting from each.
I have upgraded my intenet connection from 25 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s, but the Tor Browser das not work faster. Why not?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Random Hardware That May Be Of Use In Tor 
Below is the text from a few posts that may be of use in Tor.
Hard Drives
Program a hard drives way of writing data?
Or a software that can do it.
Raid hard drives:
Can this already be done?
Half+ data on different parts of disc?
4x+/- with say 2TB drive with data placed along the disc repeated 4 times?
making 4x512gb with 4 spots to read from? 3 backups?
--Duplicate data on opposite sides of the disk to
have the disk to only have to spin half/quarter way to read any data.
2. Set the harddrive to write in sets of data instead of 1/0.
0=00,1=01 top of platter certain partition?
0=01,1=11 bottom of platter different partition? Or a have software to interpret the data  that way.
Possibly to be extended to multiple platters with greater variations.
Using 000-111(9),,,,0000-1111(16)(+) depending on the number of hard drives in raid or platter count.
example- 512gb hd use 00-11 using 4 partitions/platter/other sets. Making a 512gb Hdd  into a 1tb hard drive. Also half/quarter the data location on the disk to increase read speed?
Creating with a 00-11 set a 256gb or 512gb hdd with 4 duplicates for reads instead of 128gb or 256gb duplicated.
Maybe 6tb 6 platter hd, made into a 12/ 24tb+/-? hard drive?
Also I would like to partition or just use a software or whatever to try to do say 100+ partitions/or read areas/other set. 10 digit+ 0000000000-1111111111
Increasing the storage amount by up to 10X depending on how data is stored?
If that is to much for a direct hardware allocation possible a software that assigns values like that to increase data storage amount ?100+fold or more?
Other- Could the 00-11 be stacked?
I'm not sure if the hard drives do this already or not, but if a harddrive
was programed to place top neg=00, top pos=01
bottom pos=11,bot neg=11. Could you add another layer in software
to make code at a higher level splitting into 4 way coding?
Doubling or many more times the capacity of a drive?
 Harddrives made like Cpus'
Cpu/Ram? access type with material from hardives deposited in the cpu die.
Layered cpu style.
Resulting Hdd size? Replace ram and hd?
Cheap intel CPU?$40?
1 for Hdd,
1for Cpu/Gpu or one of each?
1 for Ram if needed or wanted?
1 for all controller,wifi,other?
Other Possibilities?
Use a cypher/other for the data? compression?

What are the limits of disc based hard drives?
I found spin speed? Arm movement? maybe circuitry? Size of the disk?
I read a few post on how it has been tried to make them faster.
Is it just cost or what is limiting hard drive manufacturers?
2 arms in a hard drive? both able to read and write at the same time?
Multiple arms so any part of the hard drive can be read from in the same amount of time?
Disc- Rotated from the outside keeping the center of the disc?
Magnetic rotation instead of motor based? mag lev stabilization?
Spinning and holding from outside/middle/inside of disc?
Or even roller/other based?
different kind of arms?
or no arm at all?
Arm that allows each layer of arm to be in whatever position from tension or other?
1 arm motor moves layer of head each head in set ways?
Strip/other going the whole length of hard drive able to read or write from entire disc surface at once?
*multiple arms/strips that do do don't move to cover entire area.
Better aerodynamics inside of hard drive reduce friction?
Not just helium-- internal structure.
Increase speed from air flow produced?
Better heat disbursement?
Air flow in around hard drive? Heat Sink?
Sealed area around disc..
Air flow around area in harddrive..
Reverse flow blow out dust?
Single surface that covers entire disc?
Be able to read or write from any part of disc at once?
Rotating or not?
Cones multiple read heads per cone/ mechanical/other redirect for multiple locations?
head head
\ / \ _ /
\ / \_!_/switch
disc disc
Would the optical group be able to make a disc that can all be read at once with light?
Pass through for whole disc reading?
or whatever?
 What is the limit in write speeds?
Multiple discs and heads on 1 arm?
Write each bit of data one after another on different disc?
Then put them together or however in down time?
What capacity of hard drive could a chip manufacturer make in a cpu or smaller die size using current fab 14nm or larger? (Ram?)
Computer Hardware
What I would like to ask is why is computer hardware so base.
In that with the engineering potential that I hope exist the hardware barley advances each year.
Granted small improvement have taken place each year that offer more power or other.
What about the basics of what the hardware is being used for?
I speak mainly as to the consumer side of things but if similar hardware
 is being deployed on the corporate side then much could be wanted. So To Delve In.
What are the limits in the desired uses of any products?
What direction has been taken a path down and for what purpose?
ex: CPU-litho shrink, change in design,other?
What is at the core that is limiting unlimited processing power in a cpu or gpu or other?
Would that be something to set out after?
Here is some going into depth now.
CPU- Issues? Heat? Why? Resistance? Why? Other? Why?
Have the CPU manufacturers looked at every single portion of there chip and measured the resistance in that portion?  What about the motherboard?
If certain portions of chips had changes.. increases in size/increase in
 material used and a even balance was produced what would the end result
 be?
You that design and make them.
Look for energy build and lack as the energy flows through the chip.(under: Low Load/Medium Load/Full Load/Max)
Change those areas and you may have a huge with possible no cap increase in what your chip can do.
Motherboards Manufacturers-
Look at where the cpu connects to your boards as well as where junctions are.
Where other components connect.
You may find high resistance, or vacuums. (under: Low Load/Medium Load/Full Load/Max)
Fix a few of these and heat may soon become a thing of the past.
Also the connections that are used to connect the components.
PCIe for ex. Have you measured it under full to past max load and looked at the connecting components?
You may find many bottle necks across your boards along similar lines. (energy build up or vacuums)
Similar to CPU's there may be simple build ups, missing uses/connections/energy flow that hinder your performance by many hundred to thousand folds.  Consider looking at each part. (under: Low Load/Medium Load/Full Load/Max)
Components on system boards-
Look into them and find the bottlenecks or other?
(under: Low Load/Medium Load/Full Load/Max)
usb2-speed vs usb3 speed?
solution? solution fix to problem not fully understood cause?
Modification to usb2 that is different than to usb3 result- many multiple times faster than usb3.
(under: Low Load/Medium Load/Full Load/Max)
Power Supplies-
Check you wire from plug to your box.
Depending on what your using you may be loosing more than you know 1/2-2/3 the way down the power cord.
Check your energy converters? (under: Low Load/Medium Load/Full Load/Max)
You may be able to get 1600-3000 watt equivalents out of 300-600+watts of currents energy ratings.
Look and find.
Why are wires present going from desktop  power supply to the components?
Transfer power?
In wall wiring?
Jack/set of jacks (set standard?). Side of power supply or external connector?
Transfer power through wiring in case?
Connection jacks set locations under mother board lock into?
Other locations?
Liquid cooling with no liquid entering the case?(freezer type/other)
Cooling from an external source with cooling pipes run into the system insulated?
Design and running of your piping.
Cooling-Video cards.
Thermal Barrier behind GPU? Heatsink behind GPU?
Proper thermal management of heat pipes.
If the heat is building up in one area move it collect it?
If it's not being down why? You have the tools modify them.
Cooling CPU- Heat rises?
CPu heat sinks set on top of processor?
In most systems heat can travel up between the heatsink and the processor?
Many solutions-- Boards have processors that lie horizontal.
Board/heatsinks that seal the heat in to be transferred to cooling structures.
Heatsink/board combo that have a heat sink that engulfs the cpu/gpu on all sides.
!heatsink!           processor                cpu
!-----------!            --------- barrier        ---------thermal transfer material(copper/other)     ! !cpu  ! !            board                     ---------barrier

 cpu                  !!piping
Board               !!
cap- heat trapping/in connect with or without heatsink
The solutions are present. Do unknown resolution of the solution keep those creating from completing?
Heat pipping new issue --- known solution <+/- 100 ,,,,Unknown solutions  > the unknown.
Different path? What is the goal? What is the core to find the goal? Even if it isn't the current goal at hand? Cooling Cases-
Channels in a case?
Air pumped into a case through channels in a cases chassis?
Air cooled in route along cooling piping?
Directed in compressed air into onto location to be cooled?
Vacuum connected to heat producing components?
Copper tubing channeling running through the case?
laptop and desktop?
Thermally insulating heat pipes laptop and desktop?
Thermally insulating chassis laptop and desktop?
Running laptop cooling through channels air tight under pressure?
Multi cooling solutions for heat producing components dependent on heat levels produced in each heat pipe cluster.
Better fans(many more efficient designs exist.)
Ram-can be same as HDD
(under: Low Load/Medium Load/Full Load/Max)
Interface controllers- Sata/other similar to usb2-usb3--plenty of speed if found.
(under: Low Load/Medium Load/Full Load/Max)
What is the current purpose of the metal shielding liner in cables?
What effect does it have on signal/energy transfer?
How does everything perform without that?
Power cable design? With or Without/Other?
(under: Low Load/Medium Load/Full Load/Max)
Off Note:
Power lines in the power grid. How much energy bleeds of between posts? what kind of shielding other?
causing or not?
Something to look into is the high amount of energy that may be being transferred when the cable get close to the pole/post /other that is supporting it....grounding. Video Displays--- many solutions what is the desire-- many new types flexible/curved/other
What is the point of a display?-I touch some on that later.
Resolution? Not sure the current technique? pixels based?
What need to be shown? Images? Light?
Many solutions is there really a need yet?
One example- Light- speed of light. pixel change-slower?
Source light behind image- channels-shuttered/other?
source \\//\\/ channels direct light.
colors constant change as fast as light can be opened or closed.
High Res Monitors
Displays that have pixels or not even pixels but light emission that cover all/any light colorings?
Example: ---Output of one or any color combination?
Also fiber/other
Second Why is there not screen doubling/tripling/quading+
1080p  1080p
lcd         lcd---smaller sets of lcd displays?
      /    \ mirroring/other
__________________ screen
2+x 1080p=2160+????
4k-lcd x2=8k?
With mirroring and lensing--------
4-26in-1080p displays with some kind of output  software/other?
Could be turned into 1-4k-26in+/- screen with whatever lensing/other desired?
The core of the solutions-all the way to the solutions are here now to anything you may want.
All that you may need to do to find your solutions is take a step back and look at your problems a different way.
Maybe more base?
I write this and share whats below in hope that the development that can
 be done will soon start being seen as it can be done. And maybe with less effort than is know.

Here is some info that may be of use in Tor.
4k graphics down scaling to give better quality to 1080p graphics.
Hardware level up scaling Graphics/Other.
480p/1080p+/- graphics.
Output to screen hardware in system screen along data route other depending on data/path/other produces

Send only part of data to each pixel
0000111 needed for one pixel--- send 001 along route gets directed to pixel and is turn into 0000111
Combine pixels data create.
0010001 sent to pixel one and second half sent to pixel 11 as well
pixel 11=001
0111000 sent to pixel 23 send first other part sent to pixel 11 as well
pixel11 part 2 =1000
pixel 11 now equals 0011000
store data in each pixel.
Certain patterns-- data= electrons.
What patterns can be used by all pixels?
store o o oo oo oo or whatever in each value for a pixel.
Programmable hardware screen encryption.
In put electrons oo oo oo o oo oo or whtever-

Modify the scale over the network so that zero-no pulse, lower energy, other = the most common of the 2.    Network Energy Savings
I'm curious if anyone knows,
Are the current networks optimized so that the most common in
 in the data is set to the lower power of the 2 states or if in optical pulse no pulse... no pulse being set to 1,0 whichever appears more.
Is the ratio 50:50 or different?
Could a network be optimized to have more of one than the other?
Side note: in 4 state plus networking?
lower, low, high, higher.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Physical Digital Encryption 
Here's some thought I had.
Physical Digital Encryption
Listen not data to-
song a--30sec-45
song b--10sec-20 and 50-1:00
song c---.......
run through then
reorder as many ways as wanted data compression physical and encryption
audio speaker output--
software version....
Contained speaker and microphone
in device----
Reduce network data and encrypt network.
Custom microphone only certain frequencies to receive
or speaker.
Same with other hardware
wireless other.
No sending data for info.
Send references to songs/video other.
Video reference 16x16+/-grid
Part of video, section data, pixel encryption physical or digital only.
Physical-custom screen per pixel color calibration
--recorder behind screen+hardware.
Secondary smaller device that does that.
Tor+this+offline/email/other already
encrypted means of this(key/other.)
Create site from info on webpage/video/audio/text/html/other.
Creation by same means other possible sudo
webpages/other so if decrypted just as likely
to be that as any other......
Multi webpage compression one set data being none.
Put data like this every website online---
In a post/other text+website background color+
To view--- the data from each site can
be used to create any web page.
Data can be pulled from any set site(s) pages/posts/other.
Reduce visits to any one site.
Data not necessarily online?
Create key that will
create data if key+any certain site(s) visited.
Main key. General keys per info.
Create network on top of websites/web for directions and browsing.
Yahoo.com home certain variables.. constant/other
combined to create search tool/anything.
Done on persons system through software or
Second system never online.
Usb/other- No physical contact transfer data to custom system next to system.
A copy of webpages/other transferred... No wireless card/other isolated system.
Could track systems that transfer webpages usb--- not the normal.
Fully Picture/Video/Document based transfers.
Based off 1,0 in picture/video/text/program/other.
One custom picture with algorithm(sets of 1,0 passes,combinations,other)(+hex/other) contain all knowledge on web. Run in patterns on image=from any image modified or not.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Security of Tor Like Services With Or Without Tor 
So, I'm wondering Tor securely covers what's been done on the computers over a network right?
Why is it not secure and why does it need to be secured?
Others won't know what's going over the network?
Tracking all encrypted data from point a-point-b? Does this still allow tracking?
What could would happen if all the data was completely accessible and viewable by the public?
In a different form? Has this been tried?
Example: Copy of the clear web on the onion network? One page or combo of pages can create from data collusion a different web page?
Software/hardware on the user side with a way to comb and collect data from sites?
Inside programmed parameters?  All info/pictures/text/other is data?
Could take a set of 11111111111111 and combine it with 000000111111, 0011111111000 or anything to
create any information.
So In the onion network or without one would it not be possibly more secure to make the data so it has to be complied with a key on the user side so any data intercepted if any would only be random data(or webpage/other) if decrypted and could create 10,000+ possible output of any and every kind so that there could be very low chance of being able to say someone accessed a or b with the server hosting 10,000 sites(not hosting any output version of the site/info at all) that are normal and maybe 1-2 versions that are secret or whatever?

@_author: Ben Healey 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Using Encryption-Safety Of Use+Tors Goal? 
How much data over the internet is encrypted?
I found an older article that said around 6%+?
How many individual pc's servers/other actually contribute to that? Give all encrypted traffic a higher priority? Monitor systems of all encrypted traffic producers?
Physically connect/other to system that if they rally can't be accessed over the networks?
I would think if a country with vast resources wanted to monitor any system; I would be pretty certain that all data that is wanted to be monitored is being monitored by someone?
So you that have not been whatever that are doing something that is deemed unlawful, those monitoring you don't care or don't have the task to do something about it.
Think CIA vs FBI or Local PD.... CIA/Other or a sub group probably can and may are on everyone's system no matter who you are. Do they care if you don't fit into their scope?
As for the limit of the tools given to those that are given the area to care about--illegal activity.
What are their tools? routes/other? The tools they are permitted to use? As in not pulled from them keeping from public use/view if every discovered/rediscovered?
So with all that, vast resourceful government or back government that violates the laws more than any citizen(s) could every compete with; they have a means if not many to find you.
So I guess to actually keep a network like Tor secure from everyone doesn't really matter?
But from those that do care?  What are the ones who care about a Tor like net like?
What are their limits?
What would surpass them more?
If a certain level was passed would Tor be shut down? Getting into the Big Boys Territories?
