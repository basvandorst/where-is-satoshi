@_subject: tor removed from ubuntu jaunty 
If I didn't get it wrong, according to the mail, maintaining a Ubuntu
package for Tor doesn't sound much work- the .deb packages are
available from third-party repositories after all. So, is it because
nobody became interested in maintaining it or something else? If its
the former, I would be very interested to become a maintainer.
