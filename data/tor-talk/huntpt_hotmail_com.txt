@_subject: Corporate Firewall Stopping TOR 
I am trying to use tor through a corporate firewall with a proxy address of proxy.xxxx.com.  Neither of the folllowing sets of lines in torrc appear to enable this.  Obviously, there is something here that I do not understand.  If you can, please tell me what I am missing.
FascistFirewall 1
FirewallPorts 80
HttpProxy 192.xxx.yyy.zzz
FascistFirewall 1
FirewallPorts 80
HttpProxy proxy.xxx.com
(192.xxx.yyy.zzz is the IP address of proxy.xxx.com.)
Thank you in advance for your help.
