@_subject: [tor-talk] TOR middlebox and vm routing all traffic through tor 
Hash: SHA1
Hi tor-talk,
I set up a tor middlebox and a VM that (hopefully) routes all traffic
through tor. This way:
So am I right that I can use this vm as completely isolated "identity"?
And I've heard of malicious javascript, that could "break out" of TOR
browser bundle and leak information and compromise your anonymity.
But as ALL traffic is routed through tor from my vm, I'm safe?
What things have I to be aware of?
