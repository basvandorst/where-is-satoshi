@_subject: [tor-talk] Need someone to provide me with info on TOR 
I just stumbled upon the internet security that can be had with this program. Before downloading and using it I would like some comments on users as to whether or not it slows down significantly your sending or receiving of emails.........or of your web surfing. I use a Windows based system (7Pro) and simply need some user provided info about the product. Like anyone that thinks halfway logically I am very concerned about my internet privacy and if this product can really deliver I would sure like to hear from actual users about it.Please respond but only if you have actual and regular experience in using the program and both a pre and post use of the program experience.After say September 20th, because of the possible volume of emails I might receive, please cease sending any answers about the program. By then I am sure I will have heard from plenty of people regarding the program and its positives and any possible negatives.Thank you so much and I do hope to hear from responsible users soon but please not after September 20.Thanks again for your time and assistance.

I am receiving your emails but simply cannot figure out how to access the content. I dont get any links I can access by clicking on them and cannot view what is written on the subject matters shown. If you cannot help me figure out how to use your emailed product then PLEASE immediately remove me from your email list and quit sending me emails that to me are useless.
