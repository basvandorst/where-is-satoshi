I am not shure I understand very well how mailing lists like this  works, so correct me if I don't do it the way it should be.
I'm just gonna ask my question here, right ? :
If one wants to be anonymous when sending an receiving mails, one  should use privoxy and tor on his browser and also disable Java,  Javascript, cookies and so on.
Any webmail I tried to subscibe to couldn't work without either  Javascript or Cookies enabled so I suppose webmails needs Javascript  and/or Cookies enabled to work properly, am I right ?
In that case, one can't be sure of its anonymity (as cookies or  javascript are enabled) when one send or receive mails...
I hope my question is clear and sorry if the answer is obvious or if I  didn't send it to the right e-mail address

So, correct me if I misunderstandood : enabling cookies for webmail  sites preserves my privacy but Javascript is more "dangerous".
Then what should I think about links from sites like link-protectore :    or rapidshare links ?  Those require Javascript.

I didn't know about it.
I just had a look and it seems too complicated to install.
It already took me days to understand what tor is (I am not in  computer) and I can't do more.
I guess webmail with tor is safe enough, isn't it ?

So what  good free e-mail webmail account would you recommend for most  practical use and best anonymity ?

I can't get access to the webmail through Opera (Mac)...
It works with other browsers but I wish to use it on Opera.
After I put my adress and pw, I get a white page...
Anything I sould do to solve that ?
