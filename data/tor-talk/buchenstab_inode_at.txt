I'd really like to use Tor but I have the following problem that I  couldn't solve although I searched the FAQ and Wiki for days by now.  I'm not so familiar to this advanced use of my computer (for ME it's  advanced)- so I hope, someone can help me out?!
The log:
Oktober 12 11:19:43.041 [Hinweis] I learned some more directory  information, but not enough to build a circuit: We have only 96/1201  usable descriptors.
Oktober 12 11:19:43.271 [Hinweis] I learned some more directory  information, but not enough to build a circuit: We have only 192/1201  usable descriptors.

Oktober 12 11:19:43.850 [Hinweis] We now have enough directory  information to build circuits.

I'm running the 0.2.0.31 Tor pack (german) on MAC OS X 10.5.5 with an  PPPoE internet connection (account name + PW). The whole package is  installed, but as soon as I want to start Tor, I've the listed  problems. Did I forget to make more adjustements than installing it?  The Tor site doesn't say more to this. Do I have to install a proxy  internet connection?
Hoping for some help to a poor newbie who wants to learn how to surf  more securely and also wants to enlargen the network

Thanks for your reply!
Yes, I installed the vidalia bundle (Vidalia: 0.1.9; Tor:  0.2.0.31).
Yes, pppoe is always started before and runs fine (I haven't changed  anything here; should I?)
No, there was no warning as far as I remember from OSX. The firewall  is running, and -to see if there's a difference- I added the Vidalia  program in the "allow" list to let it work freely; but there was no  There's an option at vidalia for the firewall; I tested it with the  ports set automatically ("80,443"), but there's no success. Anything  else I could/should add? I'm a bit worried I forgot something "basic"  to do..

Thanks again!
Vidalia's Network Map: no, there are no lines on the map; but I've 998  relays listed as "online" at the left side with names and so on. The  window belob says (translated):  and beside of this .  After some seconds the "new" gets "missed". It seems to check new ways  but actually can't GO one.
In the meantime I've tried to solve my Privoxy problem- I suppose it's  part of the whole problem- but without success. Firefox says: "505;   This is Privoxy 3.0.6 on localhost (127.0.0.1), port 8118, enabled"  and "Connect failed. Your request for    could not be fulfilled, because the connection to  de.start2.mozilla.com (127.0.0.1) could not be established. " Privoxy  starts automatically, so it RUNS. But I can't get a connection outwards.
I tried to find answers on the Privoxy websites on this, but I've done  all I have to do for the installation; also if I change the  netconnection as requested from Privoxy to 127.0.0.1 and 8118 manually  for e.g. Safari, it brings the same information. I can't find anything  else I HAVE to do, to get it work.
