I have now sorted out my TorPark issue. Just took off TorPark and reinstalled. So, now it is working great. Thanks guy. Now I want ask:
1) Is it possible to add any Firefox extensions to TorPark? For instance, I want to add the Adsense Notifier extension.
2) Is it possible to have multiple versions of Torpark on your desktop? For instance, have one version that has the Adsense Notifier extension. Another that does not.

I am using this version:
"Torpark 1.0 has been released! No more DOS box, and much more customized But I never had these problems with the old version, with the DOS box. Would like to go back to this version. I can put up with a DOS box when Torpark actually works! Does anyone know where I can get a copy?

@_subject: FTP with Tor 
Thanks tildeone for all your help. Am currently exploring the tor_resolve stuff you kindly put down. Would be so grateful if anyone can comment further on these topics:
1) "the fact that an application speaks socks 4a doesn't mean the dns leakage problem is not present." Oh. Can you perhaps explain the significance of socks4a for me? Why is it so important to Tor if it is not related to this DNS issue? Isn't the importance of Privoxy something to do with it enabling Tor to be used as a Socks4a proxy as opposed to a Socks4 or Socks5 proxy?
2) Is this valid?:  if I input an IP address to the FTP client, instead of a domain name, then there will be no DNS issue cause it will of course not have to look up the corresponding IP address to the domain name - it already has the IP address!
3) With FTP - is it best to use Tor as a 1) Socks4a proxy 2) Socks4 proxy or 3) Socks 5 proxy?
Thanks in advance. hope you guys all have a nice weekend.

@_subject: Tor and https 
Dear all,
I want to use Tor to look at an https site. This https site being a Plesk* entry point
Plesk entry point: Note that the port used for this site is 8443.
I have tried looking at this webpage with Tor (with Privoxy and without) but cannot get it working. Help!! Would be so grateful if someone can give me some advice. If it is not possible with Tor - is there any other anonymity package I can use?
* The Plesk software package manages web servers. It allows a server administrator to set up new websites, email accounts, and DNS entries through a web-based interface.

My situation now stands as:
1) I can get Plesk working with Tor - it was not working before because I had javascript turned off!! Have now turned it on - lose a bit of security but if that is what it takes to get it to work.
2) I cannot get Plesk working with Tor AND privoxy. Privoxy seems to cause problems. Can anyone explain why? Do I need privoxy in this instance as I am feeding an IP address and not a domain name:   3) Have not been using Plesk for long time frame so not experienced problems cause of changing IP yet - will let you know how it goes. You said you had a problem with this - did you find anyway round it?

Will get onto your privoxy advice. Do you think privoxy is important given that we are dealing with IPs and not domain names. Although, something like this - is this counted as an IP entity or as a domain:
       ?
If dealing with IPs it is my understanding that the DNS problems are not an issue with Tor and Privoxy is not so important.
Just found the problem with Plesk and changing IP due to Tor - i keep getting logged out of PLesk! Is there any way around this?

"for the IP changing/logout issue, you could set your tor client config to use a specific exit node."
Good idea. I have found the configuration file. I can see that there is a lot of instruction in it. But do you know of any additional material up on the web that would really hold my hand through doing this? Thanks ever so much m8. U have been such a great help.

@_subject: chaining JAP and Tor 
Chaining JAP and Tor
Here I outline a methodology for doing this and I would be very interested to hear back as to what people think of its validity. It requires you to have both JAP and Tor installed on your system. The JAP client is set up as to use the mix cascade system (ie. it is set as an HTTP proxy in your browser and NOT a Socks proxy).
In the configuration settings JAP has the option to use a proxy. In the JAP proxy tab enter Tor as a SOCKS proxy
The data flow will then be as follows....
1) browser (http/https/ftp) points to JAP client
2) JAP client
3) data sent through ISP
4) data sent through Tor
5) data goes through JAP mix cascade
6) data arrives at target website
So, first your ISP IP is passed to Tor. Tor IP is then passed to JAP. JAP IP is then passed to target website.
Note that this arrangement does not address the DNS problem with Tor (see Tor documentation). For this we need to use an arrangement incorporating Here in the JAP proxy tab Privoxy is entered as an HTTP proxy, with Privoxy being configured to work with Tor (see Tor website for details on this).
1) browser (http/https/ftp) points to JAP client
2) JAP client
3) data sent through ISP
4) data sent through privoxy + Tor
5) data goes through JAP mix cascade
6) data arrives at target website
To reiterate, would be so grateful if people could get back to me as to whether what is outlined here is correct.

@_subject: chaining JAP and Tor 
I am aware of the security issues with JAP. As i understand it these issues are now behind it and it no longer has a backdoor - although at one time it I am hoping to chain JAP and Tor - so that I have double protection. This belt and braces approach - if there are flaws in one (eg. a back door) then I still have the other one to look after me. My anonymity is not entirely in the hands of a single entity. Even Tor, with its naval research background, could be speculated to have back doors. Althouugh I dont believe such speculation. And I am sure there are people on here that have checked its source code and can confirm this.
With the set up suggested - have I got such double protection. Is the set-up valid? Are there any JAP users on here that would like to comment?
best wishes,

FTP with Tor
I want to use Tor with FTP protocols. Specifically uploading some files to some webspace that I have (using FTP). How best to go about this? Now Tor works fine with FTP. BUT privoxy does not
support FTP. And using Tor without privoxy is not be advised.  So, how can I get around this? Would be v.grateful for any ideas. I guess "tor-resolve" may be one option. Can it solve the DNS issue and is it OK with FTP? I can see "tor-resolve" in my program files folder (i am using windows) but don't know how to use it/activate it. Cannot find anything on the web re: this. Would be so grateful for any suggestions.

Dear Paul,
Thanks ever so much for spending so much time on your post. I am very new to all this and won't pretend that I understood all of it. But can I just ask you to perhaps put it like this to me:
You see no advantage (increased level of anonymity) in chaining JAP and Tor. Is chaining them neutral (ie. no increased or decreased anonymity) or detrimental (with chaining them there is less anonymity conferred than if using just one or the other)?
Of course anonymity is just one factor - maybe speed would come into it as well. But just focusing on anonymity for now.
Thanks ever so much.

As a follow up to my last post RE: FTP with Tor
I see that Smart FTP and Filezilla FTP clients are able to use Socks 4a proxies. Does this mean that Tor can be used safely with these FTP clients? The DNS issue is not a worry. Tor does not need to be used with Privoxy when using these FTP clients (which is lucky as Privoxy does not support FTP). I would be so grateful if anyone has any pointers for using Tor with FTP.
Best wishes,

2) So, I think what you are saying is that if I input an IP address to the FTP client, instead of a domain name, then there will be no DNS issue cause it will of course not have to look up the corresponding IP address to the domain name - it already has the IP address! A good idea for sure. Now, how to get the IP address for a given ftp domain name? Could use Tor-resolve:
"a program that you run to resolve one single domain name to one sinlge IP using the tor network."
How do I run Tor-resolve? Still don't really know how to use the Tor-resolve An alternative to Tor-resolve perhaps is to use netcraft.com - this site can, given a domain name, give you the corresponding IP address.
3) With FTP - is it best to use Tor as a 1) Socks4a proxy 2) Socks4 proxy or 3) Socks 5 proxy?
Thanks ever so much. I know that I must be trying your patience but Tor with FTP is a turning out to be a little bit tricky for me.
Best wishes,

@_subject: Torpark if firefox already on computer 
Dear all,
I am using Torpark on a system that already has Firefox installed. However, when Torpark runs it says to make sure that the used computer does not have Firefox already installed! So, little bit concerned. What are the implications for using Torpark with Firefox already on the computer? I have checked my IP when using Torpark in this way - my IP is being safely hidden.
I cannot get around this issue of firefox already being present on the system. I am using Torpark on a university system - Torpark is on my H drive (the disk space I have been allocated - not sure where this is exactly. Maybe someone more familiar with university IT services will know. My files on the H drive are always available no matter what computer on the university system I log on to). Firefox is on the particular computer C drive that I am using I would guess.
So, to reiterate Q - if firefox is on the computer. How "unsafe" is it to run Torpark on this computer. Is Torpark IP hiding/protection comprimised?
Thanks so much.

@_subject: Torpark if firefox already on computer 
1) Is Torpark OK on the DNS issue? I ask this because Torpark does not have Privoxy as one of its components.
2) How does Torpark compare with (Tor+Privoxy) and (Tor) on speed?
Thanks so much. Am quite enjoying using Torpark.

@_subject: Torpark problems 
I am using Torpark and it often gives me grief. It often returns this error message instead of returning the requested webpage. Although at other times it will return pages OK. But during a session I will eventually get stopped by this error message.
The connection has timed out
The server at  is taking too long to respond.
    *   The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few
          moments.
    *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
          connection.
    *   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
          that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.
What is going on!!?? Would be v.grateful if anyone has any solutions.

@_subject: email with Tor 
Dear all,
I am using Tor to hide what country I am in when in email contact. Each time I email - I will be emailing with a different IP (most probably), originating to a range of countries - so they will not see a single country - my country of origin. The problem comes if they look at the email headers of my different emails: below I have cut and paste a part of the email Received: from hotmail.com ([65.54.229.28]) by mc12-f31.hotmail.com with Microsoft SMTPSVC(6.0.3790.211); Mon, 17 Oct 2005 05:48:40 -0700
It has time zone information in it: -0700. From this they can infer what area of the world I am in. My Ip will change accross the different emails - my country will seemingly change across the different emails (they will infer I am using some proxy service - my country couldn't possible change that often). But the time zone reveals my actual area of the world. I think the time zone info will be constant accross the different emails (the IP will change tho). Is there any way around this? Am I interpreting things right? I hope that someone can understand what I am on about. Kind regards,
