@_subject: Announce: The (Amnesic) Incognito Live System 0.6.1 
The (Amnesic) Incognito Live System, version 0.6.1, is out.
This is a bugfix-only release mainly aimed at fixing serious security
issues in bundled software. All users must upgrade as soon as possible.
What is it?
T(A)ILS is a Live system aimed at preserving your privacy and
- all outgoing connections to the Internet are forced to go through
  the Tor network;
- no trace is left on local storage devices unless explicitely asked.
    Homepage: Get it, try it, share it!
Try it! [1] Any comments are most welcome. Please note you'll need to
install the CACert root certificate into your web browser before
connecting to our web site... unless you use Debian.
    [1] What's new?
- Tor 0.2.1.28: resolves possible remote code execution, see the Tor
  project blog post [2] for details
- Other software upgrades fix grave bugs, most of these with serious
  security implications.
- FireGPG and Seahorse: use the same keyserver as the one configured in
  `gpg.conf`.
- HTP: display the logs when the clock synchronization fails.
- Use the light version of the "Are you using Tor?" webpage.
See the online Changelog [3] for more details.

Traffic is forced to be routed through Tor at the firewall level, and
there's no flash support. Torbutton does provide protection taken from the
noscript plugin to prevent information leaks too.
Actually T(A)ILS includes the support for it to be ran inside a virtual

Amnesia Live CD here is the old name for T(A)ILS live CD available at
 It changed name after the merge with the
icognito live CD project. There's already a bug report against Torbutton
to update the references in this message, (as well as the Torvm part of
it, being unmaintained) which warns you about downloading untrusted files
and read them on your computer.

@_subject: [tor-talk] New Tool Keeps Censors in the Dark - mentions Tor. 
I've read the paper when it came out, and I have to say I'm quite perplex
about it: it seems to rely a lot on ISPs, which to me aren't entities that
have interest in getting into trouble with governments, and I'm not really
ready to put trust in.
So yes, we'll see, but I have serious doubts that this technology might be
that interesting.
I'd be far more interested to see the Dust protocol being implemented as a
Tor transport option, now that this feature is possible.

Yes, I'm aware of that, I was just saying that "friendly ISP" isn't an
easy and so obvious concept to me. :)

@_subject: BHDC11 - De-anonymizing Live CDs through Physical Memory 
There is actually discussions on lkml about this [1]. Actually, code to wipe
the encryption keys in ram is already in the linux kernel, but available
only when you do a suspend. That is cryptsetup luksSuspend does use
dm_crypt's crypt_wipe_key function. There is an obvious problem when the rootfs is encrypted, as once you wipe
the encryption keys, you can't access anymore the necessary files to go on
with the shutdown process. A page on the debian wiki has started some
thoughts about this [2], surely the solution would be the kernel to issue
this wipe key function at the very end of the shutdown process. Still this
wouldn't address the issue of the system being shutdown the hard way (e.g
by removing the computer power source).
I did not test extensively, but it seems you can luksSuspend a device, and
then luskClose it, so maybe closing a non-rootfs this way might be help in
zeroing its key material.
Which is T(A)ILS does :)
There were discussions about this when the cold boot attack was disclosed,
and it didn't appears to be such a good solution [3]. But maybe you're
talking about another method.

@_subject: [tor-talk] torrc consistency 
I'm thinking to write a Config::Model package for tor, that might be
usefull in the futur for projects like freedombox or even just for debian
Point is that the torrc file as in its current state lacks a bit of
consistency, and that makes it quite hard to parse it automatically.
Seems that there are already kind of a convention in the way it is
written :
- Lines starting with ' ' are descriptions of a block of items
- Lines starting with ' are commented items.
- Items are in the form of 'Item value'
- Items sometimes have short descriptions/examples following them on the
  same line, beginning by a #
The last point is the one that lacks consistency. Sometimes items
descriptions/examples are on top of the concerned item, sometimes on the
same line, right after the item.
That would make the job easier if there was a clear convention for this
file, and if it was applied correctly everywhere.
What do you think? What would be the best way to write this file?

Config::Model probably not, but still I believe it's better if that kind
of tools don't modify too much the config file and keep it closed from the
one provided upstream.
That's why taking care of comments has some interests too, keeping user
additional comments.

Sure, but some are also at the end of the line, right after the config option.
What if the user decide to do the same, cause he/she saw some were already
done like this?

@_subject: [tor-talk] torrc consistency 
Yeah, found this ticket right after my first mail. Was waiting to see how
the discussion ends over here before/whether considering dumping there its
result. :)
Sure, but the controller is not activated by default when installing Tor,
so it wouldn't always work if one isn't using it.
I don't really think of a target audience. I'm not at all asking that
Tor's code checks the torrc format and its comment either.
I'm just considering while writing a Model::Config for Tor that it would
be far easier if at least the upstream torrc had some consistency. That
would also help every other tool/project that might need to modify this
file, without using the tor controller. See arm's code and how many lines
of it are dedicated to this job...
I guess it's just a consideration brought by the kind of tool
Config::Model or augeas are, and how it finally might require *every*
project to have some kind of policy for its config file. If not, that make
the goals of this neat tools far harder to reach. Not impossible, but
using far more work.
Speaking of it, I'll maybe rather try to do an augeas lens for torrc, then
used by Config::Model, as there are some python bindings to augeas, that
might interest arm's dev to use this mechanism. ;)
So my point was just to say maybe that could of an interest to just clean
the torrc file in the git repo and try to follow some simple rules when
modifying it in there. That's all, and that's something like a commit
modifying 3 or 4 lines, but that would make the job far easier for a lot
of people.
I don't intend to put pressure on anyone in the project with this
considerations though, was just trying to push some ideas this work raised
in my mind.

@_subject: [tor-talk] using TOR without any browser 
Have a look at how Tails proceed then, using its firewall to redirect tcp
traffic through Tor's transparent proxy support.
You can find some informations and links in its design document:
in section 3.6 you'll find some config snippets.
Also take care that if your OS support IPv6, it might leaks traffic
this way.
