@_subject: [tor-talk] Bandwidth / RAM: When does it make sense to operate a 
Hello folks,
I tried to bring this up at last years 32c3 relay operators meetup, but
I didn't get much feedback. Thus, I'm asking here ;-).
-> Who is running a tor-relay on embedded hardware (such as rasperri pi,
etc.). at home. What's your experience?
-> What platform are you using (rasperri pi?).
-> What is the minimum bandwith for a tor-relay (non-exit), that does
make sense? Are "slow" ADSL2+ connections (16Mbit/s down / 1 MBit/s up)
-> What's is your experience?
We're trying to build a small relay in our hackerspace and - depending
on what makes sense at all - give a small workshop on crafting a tor
relay on cheap hardware.
Thanks in advance

@_subject: [tor-talk] Advertised Bandwidth in tor atlas 
Hello folks,
I'm running
Atlas shows, that the advertised bandwidth is around 54 KiB/s.
The machine is running in a data center (hetzner) having:
RelayBandwidthRate 7000 KB  # Throttle traffic to 7000B/s (56Mbps)
RelayBandwidthBurst 8000 KB # But allow bursts up to 8000KB/s (64Mbps).
Do you know why atlas is showing 54 KiB/s, only?

Personally, I consider tor being a privacy tool and not a security tool:
To some extent, you can control to what extent personal information
(e.g. ip-address, browser) is known to the community.
Security is a process involving many steps (e.g. threat modelling), that
cannot be provided by tor alone. Maybe tor helps, maybe not. This is
by compromised end-devices and by their habits.
Some governments are not that reluctant on expressing their ideas
regarding purchasing information on security vulnerabilities.
Some intelligence agencies are rather proud of their
"cyber-capabilities". Some platforms (e.g. Android) an very insecure (a
bunch of critical problems each and every month, hardly patched by
device vendors).
Habits can relate to side-channels (e.g. payment, credit-cards, e-mail
addresses logged into) or data mining (e.g. analyzing texts using
IMHO "special devices" can be placed at access or core networks,
injecting exploit-payload. Some ideas have been exposed in the recent
years (Snowden / Hacking team)
IMHO you cannot reason about security without having a threat model
defining it. Thus: no.

That's a tough question. Using tor correctly usually involves adapting
your habits (e.g. your not anonymous if you're communicating with the
same contacts / have the same social graph as before).
IMHO  the best idea is to get some practical training from people having
some experience.
General, the cryptoparty initiative ( and the eff
 do trainings. Maybe, some suit suit you.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Grey Borders / Viewbox in tor 
Hello folks,
I'm using tor browser 9.0. Recently (since the last update?) a grey
border appears when maximising the window.
That's a bit annoying, since a fair share of my screen is not used for
displaying the web page. Is there a way to disable this border?

be used, otherwise. I prefer the old approach (warning before maximising
tor-browser). The gray letterbox catches my attention. Maybe a different
color, resizing behaviour (e.g. docking to letter boxes) would do
better. I guess, that other people consider this to be annoying, too.
Clearly, different sizes provide entropy - but for this letter box
(boxes? are there multiple sized ones?) to have an impact, the screen
resolution must be among the few sources of entropy to make a
statistically significant difference. Is it like this? Maybe its an
option to have more letterboxes (e.g. differeing by 10 pixels) to occupy
less space while still reducing entropy.
