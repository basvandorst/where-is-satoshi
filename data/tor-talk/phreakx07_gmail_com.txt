As of version 0.0.9.1-0.woody.1, the Debian install has been broken
for me. I've even tried to reinstall Debian, but I keep getting the
same error while executing tor. The error is as follows:
Phreakx07:/home/phreakx07# tor
Dec 20 12:38:00.206 [notice] tor_init(): Tor v0.0.9.1. This is
experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity.
Dec 20 12:38:00.206 [warn] /var/lib/tor is not owned by this UID (0).
You must fix this to proceed.
Dec 20 12:38:00.206 [err] options_act(): Couldn't access/create
private data directory /var/lib/tor
Dec 20 12:38:00.206 [err] init_from_config(): Acting on config options
left us in a broken state. Dying.
Please help me fix this..

I tried what you said & it helped a little, but not a lot. Basically
when I install tor using the apt-get command, it initializes the tor
After search through a few directories, I was able to find the script
that you was telling me about. It is in the "/etc/init.d" directory. I
restarted it by typing "./tor restart". I tried starting it as user
"root" & "debian-tor". I get the following messages:
debian-tor at Phreakx07:/etc/init.d$ ./tor start
Starting tor daemon: tor...
start-stop-daemon: Unable to set initgroups() with gid 111
Phreakx07:/etc/init.d# ./tor start
Starting tor daemon: tor...
Dec 20 16:11:43.537 [notice] tor_init(): Tor v0.0.9.1. This is
experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity.
It acts likes it's starting while I try to initialize it as root, but
I don't get any messages that I'm connecting to any mixes after that.
Nor does it work when I set Firefox to use socks 5 on port 9050, or
8118 with privoxy. So something isn't working, any other ideas on what
it might be? Thanks for your help!
