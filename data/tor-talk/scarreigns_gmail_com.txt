i use thunderbird with tor to send gmail email just fine.  see?  use SSL smtp.gmail.com port 465.  you may have to re-try with a new circuit, but it works eventually.

i had another questionable MITM attack today.  fortunately, i was connecting to my own server and was able to check the SSH logs.  the connection came from 82.103.134.252/tor-proxy.thing2thing.com.
the interesting thing is: after waiting 2-3 minutes (hoping to get a new circuit and log in to my server securely) i logged in from the same IP/exit node without any complaints from ssh about differing fingerprints!
another interesting observation is that 82.103.134.252 is not listed in the Tor node listing ( however 82.103.134.253 (AKA madrid2) is, which also resolves to the same hostname.  in fact, tor-proxy.thing2thing.com seems to have 13 IP addresses.

You should not even be using Windows Me with such security/privacy/anonymity in mind.  The main reason being M$ stopped supporting it back in June i believe.  There are probably 20 vulnerabilities in it since then that have not been patched.  Not to mention it was a relatively crappy OS to begin with.  UNIX aside, you should at least upgrade to Windows 2000 if you have old hardware and are concerned about "sluggish" behavior.  No need to defend your choice, becuase i will not listen nor argue ;)  just my $.02

gabrix @ 2006/11/16 04:28:
i'm not sure why you are wanting to do this.  but, if you are trying to be "more anonymous", then this is not the right approach.  here's why:
as i have been told (and please correct me if i'm mistaken!), basically, every OS-browser-proxy(-et.al.) combination is going to leave behind a unique footprint that can be tracked by a skilled adversary.  the more complicated you make your chain of proxies, the more unique footprint it will leave.  in this respect it is best to stick with a configuration more people use, hence anonymity.  good luck.
on the other paw, if you are doing such a thing so you can research these unique footprints and compile a database of sorts, please share your results!  the more we know, the better each application can be tuned so as to minimize and converge such unique footprints.

How about this then? .... when navigating to  the proper page is loaded and displayed.  verified by comparing the IP address of  found with and without tor_resolve.exe.  however, after entering your username/password and logging in from that page, the request is handled by login.ezboard.com, which resolved to 64.74.223.198 !!  the correct IP for login.ezboard.com is 209.66.118.157.  also, the now in-famous URL with the flanding.domainsponsor.com and SUSPECTED+UNDESIRABLE+BOT junk in it was shown as the address.  i think 64.74.223.198 possibly now hijacked the ezboard login information!  unfortunately during this time i was scurrying about trying to reset my password and wasn't able to get the IP of the exit node i was using.
fact or fear, then? ;)
using un-encrypted authentication over Tor is dumb to begin with, but this really emphasizes it i think!  this is too unfortunate as many sites still do not use SSL but sometimes Tor users still at least need location privacy.  so i for one hope we can dispose of these cyber-rats soon.

today i have had several attempted "man in the middle" attacks on my SSH sessions.  i am not sure which exit node(s) i was using, but the MD5 hash of the fingerprint of the spoofed host key is:
and it does not matter which host i connect to, the MD5 hash presented it always the same.
just a heads up

Hash: SHA256
currently, one can still send mail on port 25 using Tor.  one just might have to retry sending the message several times until a working circuit is found.  this is acceptable for me, and not for spammers.  frankly, this seems like a better solution to spam compared to biased blacklists.  so, personally, i don't think there is much need to un-block port 25 by default and re-complicate things with experimental entry/exit node filters.

i also use that same version of ZoneAlarm when in Windows (XP SP2) and it
has never crashed with Tor (0.1.1.23).  however, i do not have Vidalia or
Privoxy (i use TorCP and Polipo), so maybe it has something to do with
those apps and not Tor.

i think i can happily dis-agree with you.  after following the instructions
on the zonealarm forum for dis-abling automatic updates, etc. one must also
add "C:\Program Files\Zone Labs\ZoneAlarm\zlclient.exe" and
"C:\WINDOWS\system32\ZoneLabs\UpdClient.exe" to the program control list
and block all their access.  now, after you start windows & before
connecting to the internet, start the packet sniffer like ethereal.
zonealarm should already have started also.  after connecting to the
internet, you will see the only thing zonealarm does is try to resolve
zonelabs.com, which can be directed through Tor with something like TorDNS.
 after that, you will see there is no direct communication between your PC
and ZoneLabs.  can anyone agree? :)

is the issue here not with gmail, but perhaps javascript?  can anyone

 if there still is (in-secure re-direction), please be specific about how
to observe such an in-security.

1.) Skype Call Traced
 also directly relevant to my point
2.) need i mention skype is closed-source?
3.) when starting Tor, "This is experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity."
conclusion: don't mix a weak link with a weaker link and expect a reliable chain :)
