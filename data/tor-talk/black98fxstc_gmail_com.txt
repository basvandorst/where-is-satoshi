I wanted this too. According to the documentation (ssh_config) you can
use the ProxyCommand option and nc (netcat) to accomplish this. I
haven't really used it yet though or audited it to make sure it doesn't

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor + obfsproxy on Centos 6 
I also can get Tor and obfsproxy to compile and Tor runs normally as a
bridge. But when I try the obfsproxy all I get is
Feb 11 04:07:51.000 [warn] Could not setup the environment of the
managed proxy at '/usr/local/bin/obfsproxy'.
and Tor dies. I can't seem to convince it to log debug information
either, not sure what I'm missing.

I can't get this to work at all on Rackspace. I've tried CentOS 6.0 and
Ubuntu 11.10.
For CentOS I had to compile everything but that worked and Tor worked as
a bridge without the obfsproxy. For Ubuntu I followed the direction for
installing from the repositories and Tor worked as a bridge but not with
the proxy. All I ever get in the log on either system even with Log debug is
Feb 11 06:10:28.000 [warn] Could not setup the environment of the
managed proxy at '/usr/local/bin/obfsproxy'.
Not sure what else I can try that would be more revealing.
Ubuntu was Tor v0.2.3.11-alpha (git-8266d633bc577784)
Centos was Tor 0.2.3.11-alpha (git-9ce9836f853d8a31)

Thanks that worked! I'll post the instructions separately.

I've finally gotten it to work on CentOS with some help from Jens Kubiezie.
sudo yum install gcc autoconf automake rpm-build openssl-devel
Compile libevent and Tor RPM using the instructions here
and install Tor.
git obfsproxy and and edit /etc/tor/torrc as described here
Edit /etc/init.d/tor to include the line
export HOME=/var/lib/tor
(or choose your own directory) near the top. Then
cd obfsproxy
export libevent_CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
export libevent_LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -levent"
LIBS=-lrt ./configure
sudo make install
sudo service tor restart
Update your firewall to allow access to the Tor ports.

The attached script will configure a fresh 256MB CentOS 6.0 virtual machine
on Rackspace as an obfsproxy bridge. You have to say yes several times and
it takes awhile but it will eventually reboot as an obfsproxy bridge. I
know it gives an error at the end but it does work.
You will have to winkle out the IP address and obfsproxy port
grep ORPort /var/log/tor/tor.log
grep obfs /var/log/tor/tor.log
and send them to tor-assistants at torproject.org
It has no firewall but is only running ssh and Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] obfsproxy on CentOS 6 (help Iran) 
All I know is that the instructions say "You will need Tor
0.2.3.11-alpha or later. "
It doesn't need the LD_LIBRARY_PATH as far as I can tell. My script
doesn't use it.
At least for libevent 2.0.17 obfsproxy won't link unless you use
LIBS=-lrt ./configure

We all know the internet was invented so people could exchange porn and
pictures of their cats but I'm pretty sure that never in history has
anybody changed their opinion about porn due to a well reasoned argument
in a mailing list.

To be clearer, I was wondering if there was some specific security issue
with C++. I'm aware that it is a difficult language to use correctly and
often isn't.

@_subject: [tor-talk] memory cached pages should reload instantly-but DON'T 
Haven't investigated but if the page didn't have an Expires or
Cache-Control: max-age then the browser may be using If-Modified-Since
to avoid downloading the page unnecessarily but that would still require
a round trip to the server.
