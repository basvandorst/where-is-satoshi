@_subject: [tor-talk] Where is 32bit linux tor? 
I'm at the tor web-site  but find no link to
download a 32bit linux tor-browser. The download link gives 64bit
only. I have to select "Download in another language or platform" in order
*eventually* to find the 32bit version -- something I did out of
desperation. I hate to say this but 32bit machines are going to be
around for a bit longer. Why therefore is the default 64bit? There
should not be any defaults; all versions should be clearly and *equally*
accessible from *one* page called `Download'. Pretty revolutionary, eh?

    > 32bits downloads is still available and not difficult to find, so
Yes they are available but you have to search for them. A visitor to the
web-site does not have to search for the 64bit version. Why are you
discriminating against 32bit users?      > I don't think that is a problem. Most people have 64bit hardware

That's your opinion - you have not given any evidence that "most people
have 64bit" machines.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Where is the tor signing key? 
The URL gives the impression that the signing key email address is
torbrowser at torproject.org. However
 gpg2 --search-keys torbrowser at torproject.org gives gpg: key "torbrowser at torproject.org" not found on keyserver.
What's the correct email address for the signing key?
Best wishes,
Colin Baxter.

@_subject: [tor-talk] torrc 
Torrc gives the url  for
information. This link is strictly dead with a re-direct to
 On the latter page, the faq
'I'm supposed to "edit my torrc".' is similarly dead, with the message
"No such anchor". So where can I find info on torrc?
Best wishes,
