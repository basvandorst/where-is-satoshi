@_subject: [tor-talk] Contents of PirateBrowser 0.6b 
Since the Priate Browser has only been released for Windows so far, some
people who don't use Windows have been wondering what's in it. I put
a copy of Windows XP on a virtual machine to examine the contents of
the Pirate Browser package. I used the microsoft utility FCIV to compare the md5 and sha1 sums of
the contents of the App folder for the Pirate Browser 0.6b and the Tor
Browser Bundle 2.3.25-12(en-US). Here are my results:
Tor Browser\App\libeay32.dll
PirateBrowser 0.6b\App\libeay32.dll
Tor Browser\App\libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
PirateBrowser 0.6b\App\libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
Tor Browser\App\libssp-0.dll
PirateBrowser 0.6b\App\libssp-0.dll
Tor Browser\App\mingwm10.dll
PirateBrowser 0.6b\App\mingwm10.dll
Tor Browser\App\QtCore4.dll
PirateBrowser 0.6b\App\QtCore4.dll
Tor Browser\App\QtGui4.dll
PirateBrowser 0.6b\App\QtGUi4.dll
Tor Browser\App\QtNetwork4.dll
PirateBrowser 0.6b\App\QtNetwork4.dll
Tor Browser\App\QtXml4.dll
PirateBrowser 0.6b\App\QtXml4.dll
Tor Browser\App\ssleay32.dll
PirateBrowser 0.6b\App\ssleay32.dll
Tor Browser\App\tor.exe
PirateBrowser 0.6b\App\tor.exe
Tor Browser\App\vidalia.exe
PirateBrowser 0.6b\App\vidalia.exe
From this I conclude that the Pirate Browser includes unmodified
versions of Tor 0.2.3.25 and Vidalia 0.2.20
I also compared the md5 and sha1 sums of 'Start Tor Browser.exe' and
'Start PirateBrowser.exe'. They do not match. The Pirate Browser does not include the Docs folder that Tor Browser
Bundle has.
The torrc file looks like
this: """Begin torrc file"""

otherwise. AvoidDiskWrites 1
# Store working data, state, keys, and caches here.

@_subject: [tor-talk] More and more websites block Tor, 
Even though there are only a small number of individuals who abuse the
Tor network, those use cases get the media attention. Exciting
stories about drugs and crime end up being the only the reason that
many regular internet users will read about Tor. I think this public
perception is why so many sysadmins think it's fine to block Tor. I
seem to run into a lot of people who think "Sure there some people
out there who need Tor, like protesters in China, but mostly it's just
used for cp and drugs." These people are lacking in true information,
and need to be informed that the opposite of that sentiment is true:
there are a small number of people out there who use Tor for abuse (just
like on the internet as a whole), but mostly Tor is used by regular
people. I think some sort of public advocacy campaign could push back against
this trend. The message of such a campaign ought to be that Tor users
are not criminals or vandals, but regular netizens who believe in a
safe internet. The goal of such a campaign could be to encourage
websites to stop discriminating against Tor users.

Hi Mick, This past week on the Tor Help Desk someone requested assistance
setting up Tor to circumvent the internet censorship done by the
UK government. I wrote this blurb because I wanted the Tor community to
be alerted to this new use case. I pointed to your post so that
Tor Weekly News readers would have a frame of reference for what was
happening in the United Kingdom without revealing the contents of the
actual conversation I had. Peace, Matt Pagan

The sound quality was surprisingly clear in my tests, and I didn't have
any dropped calls, even over extended periods of time. I don't think this true at all. If you want to use torsocks and mumble
together, you may want to try it with dgoulet's new torsocks rewrite.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Imgur blocking Tor in a really reasonable fashion 
Everyone ought to have the right to protect their internet use with
Tor, including imgur rusers. If the Tor community wants Tor to be a
viable way for regular people to use the internet, we should probably
be encouraging websites not to block Tor, and educating them about
Tor's legitimate uses. When Tor users discover another website that
blocks Tor and say, well that's reasonable, we are accepting that
using Tor should be a worse, less usable exeperience for all Tor users. Peace, Matt Pagan

I wrote a letter several months ago to Project Gutenberg, asking them
as a former Librivox volunteer to please stop blocking Tor. I never got
a response back. I think it's important to continue putting pressure on websites like
Project Gutenberg by telling them about Tor's good qualities and by
asking them to please stop blocking Tor. I doubt that website operators
read the tor-talk mailing list, so they will not know that they are
alienating their visitor base unless they are informed. Peace, Matt Pagan

@_subject: [tor-talk] Spike in bridge users 
Does anyone know what the the big spike in the "Bridge users by country (BETA)"
graph was? [0] At first I thought it looked like a censorship event, but I went
through the bridge use graphs for each available country and didn't find any one
country that could account for an additional 8000 bridge users. (There were some
interesting September spikes in Cypress and Turkey but not big enough to
constitute the big spike in global usage.) Use of obfs2, obfs3 and flashproxy
did not spike, only ORPort bridges. Now that the reported number of bridge users
has dropped back down within the standard deviation, I'm wondering if it was a
metrics bug. Any ideas?

When connecting with `screen torsocks irssi -c 37lnq2veifl4kar7.onion -p

[(status)] [Jul 01 22:33:27] WARNING torsocks[26459]: [connect]

query to a local DNS server
So that irssi reports

Is this a misconfiguration on my part, or a bug with torsocks? It seems
that the old torsocks versions 1.1 and 1.2 had some similar
issues[0][1][2][3], but I'm not sure how much of that code is reused or
fixed in the 2.0 rewrite...

Hello! Glad to hear you want to help out with Tor. One project we hope
someone picks up is making an in-browser tor relay monitor. This
monitor would provide a status dashboard site on localhost specifically
for relay operators. A full description of this project can be found
on our volunteer page[0]. In fact, there are a number of other projects
on that page that you should look through to see if they look
interesting, including projects that involve working on Tor itself, the
C network daemon. A number of students are submitting applications now to work on
some of these projects with funding from the Google Summer of Code
program[1]. We are still accepting applications for this program until
March 21, so there's still time for you to apply if you'd like. [0]: [1]:

If you still get the same message after verifying the signature of your

Bundle icon. Choose 'Open' from the shortcut menu, then click 'Open'.
The app is saved as an exception to your security settings, and you

like any authorized app [1].
Apple's condition regarding signing applications are currently not

@_subject: [tor-talk] Dropping Tor Browser support for Mac OSX 10.6? 
Hi Mike,
Sorry for chiming in belatedly on this question. I still see emails
from Mac 10.5 users maybe once every two or three months on average. I
usually tell them they should either purchase an upgrade to their
operating system or switch to an operating system that doesn't make
them pay for security upgrades such as Debian, Ubuntu, or Tails.
Sometimes I get asked why Tor Browser doesn't support Mac OS 10.5, and
I can truthfully say that this was a Mozilla decision, not a Tor
Project decision, and point them to underlying cause. In more than one of these conversations, the user
explained to me that their reason for not upgrading to a more recent
version of Mac OS was financial. I also get that switching to Linux for
the first time can be a jarring transition for non-technical users.
I encounter Mac 10.6 users much more frequently than that. Probably
once a week, on average, that I know of. Most Mac users I don't find
out their OS version at all, just that they are Mac users. I imagine
there are many more Mac OS 10.6 users that don't bother emailing
support. I can think of at least one Mac 10.6 user I talked to last
month who said he was a journalist. I'm not sure if he had a 32-bit
system or not though.
I think it's more likely that rather than take the initiative to get
started with Tails, existing Mac OS 10.6 32-bit Tor Browser users would
just not upgrade the Tor Browser they have that still "works" rather
than switch their operating system (a task that requires some
commitment). Recently I can remember assisting a Tor-Browser-2.3.25
user switch to the latest version of Tor Browser after he told me that
version was "the last one that worked" for him.
Another possibility, of course, is that one of the many web forums out
there that describes sketchy Tor workarounds directs Mac users who see
bit-machine that they should just download and use this link to an old
archived Mac Tor Browser. "Awesome! Tor works now!"
Sorry for asking you to do more work, but I'm requesting that we keep
supporting Mac OS 10.6 with a deadline, maybe a year in the future.
(The number of Mac 10.5 users has definitely decreased in the past
year). If 32-bit Mac Tor Browsers are no longer distributed, I can
imagine an increase in the help desk volume when confused, sometimes
desperate, Mac users discover they can't run the Mac Tor Browser on
their 32-bit Macbook.
