I think that TOR-servers don't need to be that performant as their
usage is currently and will in future be very uncommon. So it would
be easier to deveop TOR in Java (or maybe even C This would also
reduce the probability of security-issues like buffer-overflows (may-
be it would be even possible to go back the TOR-chain through chai-
ned buffer-overflows, i.e. BOs that go from one gate in the chain
from the previous).
What do you think of my idea.

Do you need TOR on your 100MBit-LAN??? Or do you have a 100MBit
internet-connection which is saturated noteworthy with TOR-traffic?
But it's theroretically possible!

Why it is preferrable over Java or C# on code that isn't that
performance-critical like TOR?
Eh, there's Mono!
Yes, but Sun is very open to proposals an architectural discussions
as you can see from the JSR-processes.
Java isn't necessarily closed-source code - look for example at JBoss.
Yes and no (you have a huge basic footprint, but large apps like app
-servers this allotment shrinks in comparison to the rest of the code
and data of the app), but that wouldn't matter for a rather small app
like a TOR-server.
Yes, but there are two Java-Implementations which you can get for free
(the Sun- and IBM-implementations).
Java is very good for server-apps. It's more secure than C (because
you can't do any buffer-overflows which cause control-path changes)
and it's fast for server apps; Apache Tomcat f.e. is faster than
the Apache webserver even for static content!!!
Ok, it's rather a myth like the Santa Claus.
Look at what a lot of prominent open-source C-projects have buffer
-overflows. There are buffer-overflow-exploits for the SSLeay-lib
used by TOR, Apache and other apps every few months.
By whom??? *g*

Yes, but there should be efficient SSL-implementations for Java

Use C++ - it will become much shorter! *g*

> Java is way too slow and memory hogging for this kind of thing.
Yes, memory-hogging - but not slow. Look at Apache Tomcat - it
is faster than the Apache webserver even for static content!
Not, all - but it's besser than C.

Ok, if it's only the "sloppy programmers", we go back to assembly-programming.
