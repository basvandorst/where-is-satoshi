Building Tor Browser is ugly because of another critical feature that
it provides: reproducible, aka deterministic, builds. You can read more
about that feature here:
reproducible - builds .org
“Reproducible builds” aim to provide a verifiable path from software source code to its compiled binary form.
and then if you want to build it yourself (it won't be easy), start at
But in terms of just the source code changes (from the various Firefox
releases), check out
One of the goals of Tor Browser is that Tor Browser users should blend
together as much as possible. So if you run javascript here and here
and here but not there and there and there, then this unique set of
configuration choices acts like a cookie for recognizing you. That's
why there's a security slider, to disable functionality in chunks so
that we don't splinter the anonymity sets too much.

I guess I deserve it for being such a naïve idiot I have no idea what I’m doing.
