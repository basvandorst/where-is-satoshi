In addition to the above, I have the next record in my log of the tor on
my tor-node 'OrionTorNode':
You specified a server "OrionTorNode1" by name, but this name is not
registered, so it could be used by any server, not just the one you
meant. To make sure you get the same server in the future, refer to it
by key, as "$9087CA232B155B415AD81C0D3F636FC898246DEB".
But that name ('OrionTorNode1') is a name of working tor-server that

But I have an asking - were there any court proceedings (successful or
not) against tor-users based on their deanonimisation in the USA?
Because I never hear or read about it I very want to know it.
If there were no such proceedings it seems to me that we must
acknowledge that efficiency of the Tor has very high level.

I want to set up a hidden service for a new site which will be reachable
only through the Tor-network.
I have a vds running under FreeBSD with some public sites reacheble from
Internet (web-server - apache).
I am trying to set up it with accourdance of that instructions:
 , but I have
some general questions and some practical problems described the bellow.
1st General Question.
Do I need to install the thttpd web-server only into home directory of
ordinary user, to make it and to install under them, or I can use it
from FreeBSD-ports or from any Linux distr (if I will install it on
Linux system)? Is the first way oblidate and the second - depricated or
is it no difference between them?
Next, where I can get the md5, sha256 or sha512 hashes and/or digital
signatures for tarballs from here  I
can't find 'em, I'm sorry.
2st General Question.
Under wich user I need to have files in the directory of hidden service?
Of the user owned of the $HOME directory or of the user "tor" (in
FreeBSD - "_tor")? And what file permissions I need to have?
In the fist case if I type in my browser the name of one of my domains
running under that vds and the port 5222 (such as
 I can see all files in that directory.
Furtherinmore, after configuring the torrc and restarting the Tor in the
first case the Tor cannot create  "hostname"  and  "private_key" and
demand that the directory of the hidden service would be belonging to
the user "_tor".
I have tried to include the user owned by $HOME to the group "_tor" and
the user "_tor" to the first user's group and to chmod files in the
hidden service directory to "660" (for usual files) and to 770 (for
directories) but I have no suitable result.
But only after chowning that directory and their files to the "_tor"
user the Tor create the  "hostname"  and  "private_key" files.
After that I chmoded the hidden service directory to 770 and their files
to 660 and now I cannot open 'em by opening the above-mentioned URL
" which informed me about the error:
Did I do right?
P.S. It will be very nice if some instructions concerning correct
resolving of the 2st question will be include in the documentations on
the page "
3d General Question. Can any CMS such as drupal deanonymize my hidden
service by opening its ip and etc.? And what is the best CMS for
creating web-sites for using only under hidden services, without any
access from the Internet not throuhg Tor-network?
After setting up of my hidden service I have the next serious problem
which I cannot resolve.
My public web-sites "live" in the $HOME directory of one user, for
exemle /home/user/
For my hidden service I created another user which have another $HOME
directory, for example /home/user1, which contains the thttpd/hidserv

But I can confirm that somedays ago I have used oompaloompa and
oompaloompa2 for connecting to the LiveJournal.
I know it becouse their ip (and an ip of Olaf's node too) was banned by

Such sites are sites of internet bankings, systems of lodging pleadings

What is the 'criminal activity'? Do you think that the positive law is
an absolute sooth? And the existent social order are the most perfect as
it can be anywhere and anytime?!
Let's remember that the Inquisition burns thouthends people in the
strict accordance with the positive laws of that time. And the Nazi
killing millions people and detaineing them in concentration camps acted
in strict accordance with the legislation of former Nazi Germany.
I think that it doesn't need to be worry about formal legalty in the
modern World. Because that formal legalty is not a  fairness.
This I say to you, a person living in the country (Russia), in which
there is any justice in the actions of the authorities (Russian tyrant
Putin, his junta and their servants), who has long surpassed the cruelty
of Hitler and the Nazis.

'Pedofilia', in the general rule, is not a good thing, but it is not a
global problem such as poverty, starvation, social inequality and etc.
Furtherinmore buorgeois governments use "fighting with pedofilia' as
pretext on suppresion their people, breaching human rights, banning
normal human life on pseudo-religious basis (I am meaning various
interdictions of sexual life of teenagers, i.e. quite ault for sexual

It is very bad news because I am affraid that another tyrannical regimes
such as Russian can make do it too.
But it seems to me that Tor-users can use bridges and etc. for avoiding
repressive measures from "law enforcement bodies" of their countries (if
the termin "law is applicable to such bodies :) ).

I have install the TB-1.4.2 on my Iceweasel 3.5.16 working under Debian
Squeeze AMD64.
I can see new option "New Identity" in that version of TB, but it is
What is that option and why it disabled?
Furtherinmore, there are no option "reffer spoof" in the TB-1.4.2; why?

How I need to set my VM for thas purposes?
I use a VirtualBox under transparently torified user on host machine for
the most secure browsing in the Internet  but I cannot to get access to
that machine through ssh from my host machine inspite setting up
suitable port forwarding in VBox settings.
I think that the settings of my host firewall prevent that access.
So, I'll probably have such problem in the connection between my host
and guest machines if I set up a web-server on VM, and my hidden service
on my host.

As I remember when the discussing that issue was expressed the opinion
that in the Debian's Iceweales (as an old version of FF) it was not
needing urgently to migrate to the Tor Browser Bundles.
So, it was wrong and it needs to migrate.
When the Tor team you intend to release a deb-packet for the TBB?
What means the next: "Referer spoofing breaks browser navigation due to
an interaction with our content policy"? And why Mike think that the
referrer blocking feature is not very useful?
It seems to me that it - if that works without another problem - could
increase anonimity, am I wrong?

Russia is very strange country, very strange... Last time many not only
tirannycal but also idiotical norms were included into the Russian
In the list of them are laws banned people younger than 18 to be in the
streets after 10 PM, ones banned alcohol selling after 11 PM and etc.
In the beginning of this year the press-service of the FSB notified that
it needed by their opinion to ban the Tor and even the skype and the Gmail.
The Kremlin refuted that information but we in Russian know that in
means only they intend but scanning of society reaction.
I am  in doubt that they can do it.
It seems that the Russian government aspire to ban all things which able
or unable to be ban.
the FSB already has direct access to all Internet
Do you mean the so-called "SORM"-system? But as I know in the USA and in
the European countries works similar systems ("Echelon" and etc.).
Do you thinks that the SORM can break my tor connection and sneef my
Tor-traffic in the unencripted view?
It seems to me that the Putin's and Medvedev's junta have no real
interest in fighting with piracy because they have no incoming from the
show-bussiness or that income is so small that the have no real interest.
But there are many wild cries of Russian governmental  officials, owners
and servants of private organisations works for the FSB and etc. like
Kaspersky AntiVirus Lab and even of hierarch ot the Russian Orthodox
Cherch across over all Russian press and Internet for banning the Tor
and another anonymizing  remedies.
Sometimes ago the Live Journal became the mainest Russian oppositional
informatinal playground. Because it, the Putin's junta gave order to
their commercials to by the LiveJournal and ... they bought is!!!
Now the LiveJournal belong to the so-called name "SUP Company" which
works for the secret services of Russia.
And it is so stange to me that the US Government permit that spying
activity of Russian secret services in the US territory...
Regardless of all of
For break a oneman's door they need to know that it is a door of that
man. Simply talking, they must find where that man live.
As I can confirm the Tor helps us resolving that problem about 4 - 5
years and they - till the present time - cannot find locations of our
friends through our friends' Internet activity.
If they can, it is more strange to me why our friends don't arrested or
killed such long time.
It is a real problem! If they intend to arrest all people using the Tor
and etc. it could be very serious problem for fighters with regim and
for all people of my poor country...

@_subject: [tor-talk] Idiotical abuses against Tor-servers 
Periodically, about one time in a half of year, some people posts an
abuses against my Tor-server which seems as idiotical.
To days ago my vds-provider received the next abuse report:
Frankly speeking, I don't understand what is the claim. Somebody -
through my node - visit their web-site using client's web-browser...
For resolving that abuse report I include their ip-address in my exit
reject policy... And send them a message in which I note  that posting
abusing against Tor servers can create troubles to their clients which
may have an interest in their anonymity to accesse to them Internet
But it is so strange - if they don't want that anybody connect them
through the Tor, what is the problem to blacklist the list of Tor-exits?
Why they mean that it needs to post abuses?
Maybe it is a latent action against Tor-net in whole? Or it is simply an
idiocy of their system administrators?

I want to try to appeal to Russian political oppositionists to take
participation in setting up and maintaining Tor exit nodes.
I don't know whether it will have a success or not, but I intend to try.
What would it better - more nodes with narrow bandwidth or less nodes
with wide bandwidth?
