Hello dear developers and users,
lately we where able to reproduce a crasher bug on a
windows xp system. as that happened a few times we
truned on the debug-mode before.
[notice] Tor 0.0.9pre2 opening new log file.
[warn] Stream is 15 secondslate. Retrying.
[warn] circ (length: 3, exit random): solid(open)
err(open) random(open)
[warn] No Tor server exists that allows exit to
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:4662. Rejecting. (please note that I
replaced the ip-address with xxx)
[err] D:\\Documents and Settings\\someone\\My
Documents\\tor\\src\\or\\circuitlist.c:414: ???: Assertion 0 failed; aborting.

so you can change
you want us to build
Only win32-compiler I\'ve around is gcc on cygwin. Maybe
it would not be that wise to use it cause it differes
to much with what you used to compile it (could leed to
more/less/other bugs). So, a new exe or some hint about
the used compiler would be nice :)
above printed with
between them?
[err] and the last [warn] had exactly the same
timestamp. The [warn]\'s before don\'t.
There exists a few cases where only a tor_assert(0) got
called. Maybe it would be nice to have there some more
output as well for possible future probs?!
And while we are on it, is there a reason to have the
ugly lines
int err;
FILE *f;
f = fopen(\"d:\\\\foo.txt\", \"w\");
fprintf(f, \"POINT 1\\n\");
in the function nt_service_body(int argc, char **argv)
at file src/or/main.c? Some kind of checking if d: is
writeable? and if not just crash (no f==NULL check)?
