@_subject: [tor-talk] how does Tor generate IP Address 
I would like to know how IP addresses are generated by Tor. If I use Tor ,
is there a chance that my IP address would be assigned as proxy address of
another Tor client?
Thank You

I have used Tor as a client and notice that each time I refresh my page, my
IP Address is shown as a different one. I would like to know how these IP
Addresses are assigned
Thank You
