@_subject: [tor-talk] Thanks 
I just want to let you know that I love and appreciate the work your team
does towards making using the internet uncensored and just as importantly
anonymous. The opportunities this opens up are boundless and for the
project to offer TOR for no charge is really something. So thanks allot and
happy onion routing. :)
