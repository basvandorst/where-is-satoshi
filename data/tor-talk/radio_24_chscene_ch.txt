@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor transparent proxy -> strange behavior regarding 
Hey all,
I hope, I’m not off-topic with my question…
For the last two years, I’ve been running several Tor transparent proxies at different places (Raspberry Pi, Debian). This worked like a charm, but since last autumn, Firefox and Safari don't display .onion sites anymore. But here is the thing: On the exact same client with the exact same proxy, Google Chrome works without problems. This behavior concerns all my boxes with different clients in different network environments. I don’t know when, precisely, it started to happen, because I don’t use .onion sites very often. Nevertheless, I didn’t change anything in the box configuration. Regarding Firefox, I already set the network.dns.blockDotOnion = false.  All other sites are working without any problem and are routed through the Tor network as it should be. Torrc on the proxy looks like that: Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
VirtualAddrNetworkIPv4 10.192.0.0/10
AutomapHostsSuffixes .onion,.exit
AutomapHostsOnResolve 1
TransPort 192.168.42.1:9040
DNSPort 192.168.42.1:9053
DisableDebuggerAttachment 0
ControlPort 9051
HashedControlPassword Firefox message:
Server not found
Firefox can’t find the server at facebookcorewwwi.onion
I searched for more information about this problem on the web, on the different mailing lists and on reddit the last weeks, but didn’t find anything which helped me to solve or even explain this strange behavior.
Does anyone have an idea why .onion sites work on Google Chrome but not on the other browsers anymore? I’m grateful for any hints.

Thanks, Ivan for your answer.
On my client (macOS Sierra, 192.168.42.11), wireshark shows me for Google Chrome following request/response (192.168.42.1 is the IP of the transparent Tor proxy):
192.168.42.11	192.168.42.1	DNS	  82	Standard query 0x9692 A deepdot35wvmeyd5.onion
192.168.42.1	192.168.42.11	DNS	  98	Standard query response 0x9692 A deepdot35wvmeyd5.onion A 10.234.82.239
In other words: it works as expected. But with Firefox and Safari I don’t see anything — whether with wireshark on the client nor with tcpdump on the proxy. Under about:networking , DNS-Lookup, Firefox's response is NS_ERROR_UNKNOWN_HOST. It seems as if macOS Sierra decided that .onion is not a valid DNS name and didn’t make a DNS request at all (and yes, I did flush the DNS cache before).
To replicate this behavior, I took an old Macbook with OS X El Capitan with exactly the same network configuration (Router: 192.168.42.1 / DNS: 192.168.42.1 / Search Domain: local). It worked without problems (Firefox / Safari have on both computers exactly the same plugins).
More tests: It doesn’t work on iOS 10.2 either.
