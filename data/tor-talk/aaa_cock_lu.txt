First they fall for the social justice meme thinking it's a force for Then they allow the project to be infiltrated by the blue haired problem glasses brigade.
Then they start modifying their community guidelines to appease their new members, probably under the guise that it's to prevent evil sexist MRAs from "harassing" (read: disagreeing with) their new SJW friends.
Then the SJWs decide prominent members of the project need to be cyber lynched so they can take over.
"Jacob once farted in the same elevator as me, it was literally rape! "Jacob once disagreed with me, it was a legitimate death threat that made me fear for my life! "He once mentioned playing a video game, I knew he was a gamergater! Damn misogynist hates women! Then Tor loses their best spokesman.
The SJWs and their friends fill the now empty jobs and repeat the process until they're the only ones with power over the project.
Then Tor dies, since the only "work" that gets done is virtue signalling on Twitter.
It's only a matter of time before they eat Nick or Roger.
RIP Jacob.
RIP Tor.
Usually I get a lot of schadenfreude from watching idiots destroy themselves like this, but Tor is close to my heart so I'm quite sad.
The NSA has won.

Do you think that smug asshole still agrees with censorship and lynch mobbing now that he's the target of them?
Do you still think he agrees with this comic now that he's the one who's been turned into a pariah for daring to cross a female?
Remember that all that was done because people were DISAGREEING WITH ANDREA ON TWITTER.
I wondered what spurred the creation of  ? Probably that he was getting too much attention / money and Andrea felt the need to flex her muscles and take him down a peg.
