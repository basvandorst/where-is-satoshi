@_subject: [tor-talk] Setting up an E-mail account using TOR 
Hi, I'm trying to set up a few e-mail accounts using TOR. Because aol won't consider any postal code I put in as acceptable -all real postal codes- is their any way to utilize TOR's IP shuffling ability to my advantage when setting up sock accounts?                                                                                                Thank you.?
