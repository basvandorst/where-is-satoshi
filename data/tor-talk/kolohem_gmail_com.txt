Iran is not currently using IP filtering. You can run multiple bridges so long as they use different ports. Some countries do use filtering that would block bridges so a rotating IP could be beneficial. -----Original Message-----

Does it currently make more sense to run bridges from machines with
fixed IP addresses or with changing ones? And is the answer for this
the same for obfuscated bridges?
Earlier, I have understood that running a bridge with changing IP
addresses, such as dialup IP space, is quite fine and helpful, so
I changed my home tor installation to run a bridge, even if I don't
run my machine 24/7. Would it help to change the machine into an
obfuscated bridge?
If so, I'd be willing to give it a try; compilation of obfsproxy
has already succeeded.

You will need the send the new IP:Port to Tor-asssitants. Maybe you could Cron Job it?

thanks for asking and answering this, i was wondering about it as well.
going to keep stillhavenoipinfo running as is then.
two more questions:
- is it possible to run obfusproxy on an EC2 instance? (never played
with EC2, but given the ready made bridge img...)
- if i run an obfus-bridge node at home (ADSL, NAT'd), can
tor-assistants deal with a dyndns name (IP is changed every 24h by our
beloved Deutsche Telekom)?
useful info

You are correct. The link shows as tor-assistants but links to tor-talk. It should link to tor-assistants. -----Original Message-----

Use the Tor Browser Bundle and Vidalia Control Panel to setup a relay/bridge. When closing Aurora and a Tor process continues to run may have been a bug that has been resolved. -----Original Message-----

I have tended to find that the packaged tor is virtually always behind and so I get notices that there is a new version and I should upgrade but with no means of doing so because all that is available is the browser bundle.

In the TBB use the Vidalia Control Panel to set the Socks Port. Settings > Advanced > Edit current torrc. Add or modify the socks port line to read 'SocksPort 9050' or the port you wish Thunderbird to use. Save settings if you want them to persist.  Follow the same steps as in the wiki. -----Original Message-----

Greetings in a New Year!
I've recently switched from Tor + Privoxy setup to the more convenient
TBB 0.2.2.35 (Qt4.6.2) in a Linux environment. Under prior config. it
was easy to set up the Thunderbird email client for use with Tor.
However, after the TBB install the same configuration for T'Bird no
Perhaps ^^ is an old link? What is the best step? Because TBB
automatically uses SOCKS (at least for Aurora), perhaps I no longer need
bother with the manual set up in T'Bird?
If I were to recommend the Thunderbird setup with Tor to someone in a
country where an improper configuration might result in a knock on the
door in the middle of the night, I would want the margin for error as
near zero as possible. Even one non-anon log-in to email might cause
problems. Consider me professionally paranoid. Erich Kroener
