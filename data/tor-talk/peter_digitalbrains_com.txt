@_subject: SCTP 
Actually, Linux has it as well. I have never used it (SCTP either with or
without NAT), and I'm not adept in linux kernel development, but it looks
like the first version of module net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_nat_proto_sctp.ko was
committed on April 14, 2008.

@_subject: Observed bandwidth doubled? 
This is my first message to this list. I've tried searching for the answer to my question in the archives, but I couldn't find it.
I run a Tor non-exit relay, named DigitalBrains. Bandwidth is shaped and prioritized by Linux, with the HTB scheduler in the 2.6 kernel. The maximum token rate is 750,000 bits/s. To be completely exact, the iproute2 command that shapes my TOR traffic is:
# tc class add dev eth0 parent 1:1 classid 1:12 htb rate 80Kbit quantum 1600 ceil 750Kbit
It will borrow tokens when there is no higher-priority traffic. This is the upstream traffic, i.e., away from the server. Downstream traffic is not shaped.
Now, if I don't enter any shaping configuration in my torrc, the observed bandwidth in the server descriptor happily doubles that rate:
