One quick note on Whonix vs. Tails:
If malware roots your Tails, then it is game over for your anonymity, as your real IP and MAC are exposed.
With Whonix, the Tor process is further isolated out into a separate machine (virtual or physical), so that root-privileged malware or other misbehaving apps can't just circumvent the Tor connection and get access to your real IP or MAC address.
Put a strong condom on your Tor isolation.
Hat tip to mirimir for the mention of our high security Qubes + Whonix option too. ;)

Dave's response addresses this. The point is not to absolutely isolate the Whonix-Gateway where the Tor process is. Although, the Whonix-Gateway does force its own connections through Tor, but not secure against root-privileged malware.
Rather, the point is for your user machine (Whonix-Workstation) to be securely isolated from reaching the clearnet, getting your real IP or MAC address, etc.
You don't want the Tor process to be in the same security domain as the user applications, since something malicious or misbehaving can simply bypass it in one shot. Tails puts them both in the same general security domain, so Tor protection can be bypassed and then it is game over.
The reality of this is somewhat different with Qubes.
This is why I launched the Qubes + Whonix project last year.
The security strength of Qubes VM isolation goes meaningfully beyond typical VMs.
More info:  I believe it is probably generally harder to break out of a virtual machine than root a Linux distro, like Tails, because hypervisors have a more limited attack surface compared to a full monolithic OS.
If you use Qubes, then it is infinitely harder to root the host system.
Right. But hypervisors are more minimal than a full bloated monolithic Linux OS with hundreds of millions of lines of code, so naturally less general attack surface exists to exploit.
For a usable system, Qubes currently goes the furthest with secure host I'm also working to push even further towards building even stronger security + anonymity systems in the future.
Not at this time.
However, with disk encryption, deleting VMs after usage, and overwriting disk space, this same anti-forensics effect can be accomplished with

Hi Yuri,
Yes, I am aware of these exploits and agree that Qubes is indeed vulnerable to the most advanced low-level hardware, firmware, side channel, evil manufacturer, and evil developer attacks.
I'm also not arguing security of hypervisor vs. bare metal inherently as generic technologies.
I'm saying, standing on their own, the security architecture of Qubes is meaningfully stronger than bare metal Linux.
And I'm not basing the argument only on the listed top 1% of most advanced attacks that can cut through any system -- even Qubes.
It changes the argument entirely to ONLY focus on that top 1% of the most strongest exploits. If only focusing on these, then sure, I agree.
That's like saying just because an atomic weapon can equally destroy both a bank vault and a cash register with ease, that there is no security difference between the two.
Most real world systems are usually not up against such attacks. Another way to say this is that, out of all the total computer exploits actively happening in the world every day, month, year, the vast majority are not the ones that can get past the security of Qubes.
A good number more attacks could actually get past the security of bare metal Linux though, which shows the difference and makes my point about relative security strength.
In bare metal Linux, for example, just viewing a malformed webpage, pdf, email, etc could pwn your total system (!!!).
So I'd rather run with some VM containment than none.
And most hypervisors, especially Type 2 (installed like VirtualBox), are subject to much greater attack surface than Qubes, and generally poorer security engineering.
Overall, I'm saying for the majority of real world exploits, there is a meaningful security difference between the actual TCB attack surface:
Bare Metal Linux  >  Typical VM Linux (VirtualBox etc)  >  Qubes VM Yes, there is still open TCB attack surface on ALL systems, including Qubes, but there is meaningfully less, when comparing against all different classes of real world attacks, due to Qubes' purposefully isolated non-monolithic architecture and lower LOC count.
More info:
- - - And my next major project will hopefully overcome most all of the top-tier low-level exploits you mentioned and shift us further towards truly bulletproof security + anonymity systems. :)

I guess it comes down to a fundamental computer science question of whether or not the TCB of computing machines can be engineered to be truly secure, or not, against remote host compromise?
I realize that nothing in production today meets this high standard.

BTW, while I primarily use Whonix, I am a Tails user too. :)
Despite that being the good faith intention, I don't think this is true.
I believe the general principle is called "privilege escalation".
When malware escalates its privilege in bare metal Linux/BSD/Tails...game over.
With the qualifier of "massively", it depends upon the sophistication of attack one is comparing this statement too. Or one's own personal Personally, I'm not comfortable with bare metal Linux or BSD distros Far too much TCB attack surface for my tastes.
But, for security purposes, why not run Qubes + Whonix or Qubes + Tails, instead of just Whonix or Tails without Qubes' added system isolation?
Right. And I personally use both, but more so Whonix.
Tails suffers from limitations due to its nature as a live distro.
Whonix suffers from limitations due to its nature as an install distro.

Thanks for posting this story.
GPG is certainly a fundamental tool that many of us rely upon and is well-deserving of more donations and funding.
I will certainly donate some euros to him soon.
I'm developing security/anonymity-focused free software (Qubes + Whonix) without any funding or donations, but am largely driven by my strong personal desires for having and using such software. This strong personal desire sustains me as long as I need such software for myself (probably several years into the future). And I'm focused on a software platform that affects my entire computing base, from low-level system infrastructure to high-level user applications.
I could see how not really truly personally needing his own software, or focusing so tightly on maintaining a secondary component of his own computing needs and for other people, would wear on a developer/person over time, compared to the development situation I'm currently in.
Overall the free software community focused on security and privacy really needs meaningful investment made into it that reflect its fundamental value to society.
Sadly, most users just want shiny new stuff with cool features, and so closed source mainstream technology corporations see the majority of all demand and revenue from users.
Sadly, the most powerful arms of governments around the world do not want robust open source security and privacy/anonymity tools to be Leveraging the self-interest of corporations and wealthy individuals is probably where the most fertile ground currently exists for large funding of open source security/privacy tools.
There probably needs to be a further mass culture shift of realizing...
Open Source = Trustable = Secure/Private
Closed Source  = Untrustable = Backdoored/Spyware
The corporations and wealthy individuals take in trillions per year. Spending a fraction of a fraction to ensure the technology that their organizations, families, and themselves personally use is trustworthy/secure/private and is not compromising their own lives should be an investment no-brainer for them, since they as a class control trillions per year in financial resources. If they can just make the very good association to open source technology and very bad association to closed source technology. Unlike less-powerful organizations and less-wealthy people, they have both the means and motives to ensure that their technology is not screwing them, by investing into key open source projects.
As more business executives and business IT people make the association of closed source being untrustworthy, there is probably some growing market demand for business products to deliver open source security and privacy technologies to businesses/corporations. It would be great if there were more beneficial financial links between successful open source security/privacy products and the open source infrastructure we all widely rely upon. For example, just *one* popular security/privacy tool, based on open source, could generate the funds to double or more Tor's current stream of annual funding.
And, also, I wonder why "bad guys" of the world don't regularly invest many millions into open source technology development. It would seem to be in their logical opsec self-interest and they have the economic means as well. Not that they'd openly write checks with their name on it, but done anonymously via cryptocurrency etc.
Low open source funding is probably one of the biggest security holes to the integrity of our infrastructure/security/privacy/anonymity tools.
It is hard to even point to a stack of existing tools for anybody, even including to us security/anonymity tool developers, to remain truly secure and private, since so much key infrastructure is so over-bloated, under-verified, and ripe for exploits.
This quote from the article is probably also one of the key reasons why our industry of open source security/privacy remains so grossly "Really I am better at programming than this business stuff."
The "business stuff" is a fundamental key for ensuring the successful -- not just social mission -- but actual core technical integrity of our security/privacy technology.
We'd be many years ahead of our current development and verification curve as an industry if we had greater financial resources within our currently teeny tiny industry that probably at least hundreds of millions of people are directly trusting in and relying upon.
Those who have the most money and most to lose should be running to invest in key projects. And we should do better at positioning ourselves and our industry for such (ethical) investments.
Such a critical issue!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor as a network filter 
Whonix is optimized to run as virtual machines.
It does also run on physical machines, but is optimized for VMs.
Whonix is currently based on Debian.
There are two VMs that come with Whonix.
Whonix-Workstation and Whonix-Gateway
The Whonix-Workstation is where your user applications run. You can alternatively use other OS desktop environments than the Whonix-Workstation. But this one is optimized for ensuring proper Tor The Whonix-Gateway is where the Tor service runs and all internet traffic from your other desktop VMs gets forced/filtered through the Tor This TwoVM configuration of a separate Gateway and separate Workstation makes it so that the Tor connection cannot be bypassed. For example, by malware or misconfigured apps that might otherwise leak your IP address or MAC address if it could break out of the VM and Tor isolation.
Hope that helps!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor as a network filter 
No problem. :)
Yuri is correct. Tor does not provide an internet filter for Sounds like you are looking for what is known as an "Application An application firewall would be on the desktop machine or as a separate machine on the network, in-between your apps and the regular or Tor internet connection.
Then the rules you set for the application firewall would determine which apps get access to the internet or Tor, and at what times of day, for which users, etc.
Potential configurations might look like:
Applications --> Application Firewall --> Tor Network --> Normal Applications --> Application Firewall --> Normal Internet
Whonix works good for sending your OS's traffic through the Tor network. An application firewall could also be installed with Whonix or other systems by the user to control the filtering of access on a per application basis.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden Service (Nginx) setup guide 
Nice to see more user friendly information on setting up hidden services being published. :)
I'm a maintainer of the Qubes + Whonix platform.
Correct that Whonix or Qubes + Whonix is not optimized for remote server configurations (but can be used if one has the resources and is a more advanced admin).
Although, noted as beyond the scope of Thomas' article, one potential downfall (which many will accept) is that even with some dynamic software-driven disablement of the server's networking upon intrusion detection, if malware gets in, then it can still get out by re-enabling whatever services are disabled.
So using a separate Gateway & Workstation for forcing even malware out through the Tor Gateway could be of great anonymity importance for some HS operators.
FYI: I'm writing a new user application on top of Qubes + Whonix this year, and am probably going to add in an easy point-and-click or fully automated Hidden Service setup at some point.
Also, with upcoming version R3, Qubes should be coming to KVM, etc, in the future, so it can be installed as an app onto other OSes and Qubes + Whonix will then hopefully be able to have a more minimal footprint on typical VPS or User systems.
Also, which many people here know, Hidden Services on user desktops has some interesting applications beyond web servers.
BTW, thanks for your personal support of Whonix! :)

Hi George,
I wrote the Whonix install guide you're using.
Make sure you're in the directory where your Whonix .libvirt.xz files Step  is just for extracting out the .qcow2 and supporting files.
Later, in step  the .qcow2 images are converted to .img images.
Hopefully you've got it resolved by now.
A few additional notes about Qubes + Whonix...
- Dedicated Forum:
We have a dedicated support forum for Qubes + Whonix, where more personal assistance can be given.
- Whonix Upgrade:
Whonix 9.6 is going to replace 9.4 any day now, due to an update key error inside 9.4. Whonix 9.6 is uploaded to the download mirror for testers, so you can use that now instead of 9.4 if you please, which may help you out.
- New Platform:
The HVM instructions you are currently using are in the process of being obsoleted, as we have a brand new, greatly improved, native Qubes + Whonix platform. It uses a streamlined native ProxyVM + AppVM architecture, compared to the old limited dual HVM setup. It is currently being leak tested and banged on for the first time, but is publicly available, and several people are using it already, if you wanted to start using it now. The install process of the new Qubes + Whonix is much much easier too.

@_subject: [tor-talk] New Announcement: Major Updates for Qubes + Whonix! 
Hello everyone, WhonixQubes here. :)
I wanted to finally update you on some major updates with the Qubes + Whonix platform that have been accomplished over the past few months.
TLDR Summary:
Qubes + Whonix is the seamless combination of Qubes OS and Whonix OS for best-in-class Security + Anonymity.
The Qubes + Whonix port has been fundamentally upgraded to a native seamless architecture (ProxyVM + AppVM).
Qubes + Whonix is now easy to install (Install Guide available on the wiki) and most all of the past usability issues have been fixed.
We now have upstream integration into the Qubes codebase and templates We now have newly updated documentation guides on our wiki with more to come soon.
Based on Qubes OS R2 and Whonix OS 9.6, the current newly released versions of the new Qubes + Whonix RPM templates is 2.1.8 and DEB updates package is 9.6.2.
Qubes + Whonix Primary Sources:
- Wiki:    - Forum:   - Blog:    - Tracker: Full Version:
First: What is Qubes + Whonix all about?
Qubes OS (qubes-os.org) is one of the most secure OS architectures you will ever encounter that is able to withstand greater attack due to its advanced isolation properties.
Whonix OS (whonix.org) is a Tor-based virtual machine OS for anonymizing all of your traffic through Tor in a meaningfully more optimal and secure way than normal.
Qubes + Whonix is the seamless combination of Qubes OS and Whonix OS for best-in-class Security + Anonymity.
New Architecture:
Last year, I accomplished the first port of Whonix OS over to Qubes OS.
Now, with big thanks to nrgaway, we have a new -- much improved -- seamless combination of Qubes + Whonix.
The new Qubes + Whonix is a much more natively integrated, seamless and easy to use combination of Qubes + Whonix.
Instead of the old TwoHVM architecture, we now make use of a seamless ProxyVM + AppVM architecture.
The Whonix-Workstation is installed as an AppVM in Qubes, which is where your user applications reside, and all of their traffic gets forced through the separate Whonix-Gateway Tor ProxyVM.
The Whonix-Gateway is installed as a ProxyVM in Qubes, which is where your Tor connection proxy resides, and is securely isolated so that malware can't simply circumvent your Tor connection to easily find out your real identity, as it can with other Tor systems.
With the new architecture, we have seamless GUI desktop integration with Qubes OS.
And we have Qubes tools integration that allow for things like easy-and-secure copy/paste as well as easy-and-secure file moving between VMs.
 From the base TemplateVMs, you can dynamically generate as many Whonix VMs as you please, to use simultaneously, for more optimal anonymous workspace isolation.
The new native port architecture of Qubes + Whonix is much more useful.
Upsteam Integration and Install/Updates:
The Qubes team has enjoyed our work on Qubes + Whonix and we now have upstream integration in the Qubes codebase and templates repository.
This also means that installation is very easy to do via the RPM packages (Install Guide available on the wiki).
Also, much of the Qubes + Whonix code has been moved out of the Qubes template builder codebase to an independent Whonix package called This qubes-whonix package will now allow us to push more convenient updates to Qubes + Whonix without always needing to rebuild and reinstall the underlying TemplateVMs.
So install and update are much improved.
Qubes + Whonix Packages:
There are now three packages specific to the Qubes + Whonix platform - Whonix-Gateway TemplateVM which comes as a RPM package in Qubes and is currently at version 2.1.8.
- Whonix-Workstation TemplateVM which comes as a RPM package in Qubes and is currently at version 2.1.8.
- qubes-whonix which comes as a DEB updates package in Whonix and is currently at version 9.6.2.
These current versions are based on Qubes OS R2 and Whonix OS 9.6.
New and Improved Documentation:
We have new documentation for Qubes + Whonix on our wiki Here you can learn more about the platform and get some primary guides on how to work with Qubes + Whonix.
The new documentation was just recently launched and more is being added throughout the near-term future.
To learn more, go check it out the wiki documentation for yourself.
Also, the general Whonix wiki has extensive knowledge available about optimizing your Tor-based anonymity.
So, if you want to supercharge your Security + Anonymity, then feel free to try out Qubes + Whonix.
Also, if you've got skills, feel free to get in touch and join in on the development effort of the Qubes + Whonix platform.
More improvements coming soon.
Thanks everyone! :)
