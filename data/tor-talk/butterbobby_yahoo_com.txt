@_subject: Why so many exit nodes in Absecon, New Jersey? 
I was looking through  and I find it most interesting that so many exit nodes are located at Absecon, New Jersey. These are:

agnodicelabnet1 - tor-exit-2.lab.net - 173.255.238.178

PIis3141592 - tor-proxy.l.egofuzzer.net - 173.255.212.184
Accoring to Wikipedia Absecon has a population of under 10,000 people.
Does anyone know why there is such a concentration of nodes in this one small place? ?
