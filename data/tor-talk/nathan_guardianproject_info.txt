============================== START ==============================
Looks like we have another way to get home users to run long-lived
bridges... on their Google TV-powered set-top box:
Of course, we'll have to see how Android Service lifecycles work in this
context, but I can definitely imagine, in a world where Android-on-TV is
a success, that this would be the easiest way to bootstrap a whole bunch
of bridge IPs quickly.
