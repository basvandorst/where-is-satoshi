@_subject: Recommendation for ISP in Germany? 
Hi all,
I'd like to set up a Tor node on a server in Germany and I'm looking for
people with experience in doing this. Can anybody recommend a german ISP
who provides servers for running a Tor node? The Wiki page[0] does not
contain that many information about ISPs. I'm especially interested in
people's experience with virtual vs. dedicated servers.
