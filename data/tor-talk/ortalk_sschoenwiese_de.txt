Hasn't there been a thread lately about tor mixing up pages or something like that? Maybe that's the case here too. Can you reproduce your findings?

There seems to be a slight problem with this connection data. Neither
"plotin" (my node) nor "lifuka" (not my node) are exit nodes. Is there
any scenario in which non-exit-nodes would appear as last hops in a circuit?

hmm, funny, same here. I set ExitNodes and StrictExitNodes in my torrc to play
around with this. Using the .exit-URL I get an empty page from my URL too. But I
just tried it that way with some other pages
etc.), with these it works. The node often seems to try to inject the following
code directly after the body-tag (but not always):
Other than that it seems to inject some random stuff right into the page.

@_subject: Bad exit? 
Hi there,
I've encountered strange behavior using the exit node
f36a9830dcf35944b8abb235da29a9bbded541bc. It seems to inject random stuff (JS,
ads, porn) into the resulting pages. Can anyone verify this? Give it a try at
some simple page and view the source. At  the source
should look like this:
Hello World
Using f36a9830dcf35944b8abb235da29a9bbded541bc as exit it is for example
something like that:
<script src="

@_subject: Monitoring TOR 
Hi all,
I had some problems with my TOR server (plotin) recently. My provider
hard-limited my bandwidth from 100Mbit to 10MBit and the ongoing massive
data from TOR users essentially DoS'ed my server afterwards. As the
server is mainly used for TOR I didn't notice anything strange until the
node did no longer appear in the torstatus pages.
What happened was that the server was not able to obtain new directory
information due to timeouts and thus could not create new circuits.
As I'm quite certain that such a thing will happen again (my provider
limits the bandwidth after some amount of data has been transfered) I'm
looking for some kind of monitoring for the TOR server. Is there
something out there (mon daemon script for example) or do I have to
build something from scratch?
PS. As a result of this I had to limit the bandwidth the TOR server may
use significantly, sorry guys :-(
