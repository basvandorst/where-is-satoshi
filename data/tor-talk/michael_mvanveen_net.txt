@_subject: [tor-talk] Added a tor node 
I just followed the directions on this page:
having first picked up the link on hacker news.
I had to tweak things a little bit to work, but the ticket here has helped
I believe my tor node is up and running, but I have no way to verify.
Is there an easy way to determine if I have configured my tor bridge
Best regards,
