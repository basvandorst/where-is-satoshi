@_subject: [tor-talk] Manual Update of Tor-Network-Components in Tor-Browser 
I use an older Version of Tor-Browser on an old Linux-machine.
Tor seems to use a list of "initial Tor-Nodes to contact" when I establish a connection to the Tor-Network (i.e. turtles.fscked.org). Some entries in this list (i.e. the IP-Adresse 212.112.245.170) seem not to be valid anymore and cannot be contacted. Is it possible to update this list without updating the Tor-Browser-Package?
Or ist this Node (212.112.245.170) still valid and do I have a Thanks, regards

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question Regarding Routing of Network-Traffic using 
I am from Germany and I use the Tor-Browser very often. I think Tor is a great product.
I have a question regarding the connection from my Tor-Browser to the I noticed, that Tor tends to always connect to the same Tor-Relays on the internet. I can observe this when I monitor the connections using Netstat on my Linux-machine - even after restart of the Tor-Browser or even after a reboot of the Linux-machine.
So my initial Idea was to delete the "cached*-files" in the always connects basically to the same Tor-Nodes all the time. I think this is probably due to an internal "ranking" in the Tor-Network.
So my question is, would?nt it be better (or more secure) for the End-User, if the Tor-Browser (or the Onion-Router) would change the used Tor-Relays i.e. every 5 minutes. As the Tor-Browser connects to more than one Tor-Relay, this could be staged, Drop Tor-Relay 1 after connection to Tor-Relay 3 has been established i.e.
Are there any plans to enhance the Tor-Network / the Tor-Browser in this Thank you very much.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question Regarding Routing of Network-Traffic using 
I read the linked Page and understand most of the ideas behind the concept of using only a few number of Entry-Guadrs. However, as I understand Entry Guards are chosen by Parameters like Response-Time or If  i.e North Corea. would like to control the Tor-Network in NC, NC would have to do the following things:
1. Slow down (or disable) the rest of the Internet from outside NC 2. Setup some fast Tor-Servers (Primary Entry Guards) inside NC.
3. Provide fast Tor-Relays (inside NC) that are accessible from these Entry Guards (other Tor-Relays are slow from or inaccessible these Entry 4. Provide (fast) Exit-Nodes inside NC.
In this scenario the fast Primary Entry Guards would proably the chosen for almost any Network-Traffic using Tor, and I could at least see which IP-Source-Adresse would bei using Tor.
If the rest of the Tor-Network would rely on Performance-Data for Routing the Traffic, NC could proably also see the Tor-Relays (and maybe even the Exit-Nodes) - so Tor would be (somehow) useless.
So in my opinion it would be at least a good (configurable) option to provide dynamic switching of the Entry-Guards - as this would at least make it more difficult to trace every move of a Tor-User.

O.K., so if the Guards that are used are based on the view of the
network, this means NC knows which Entry-Guards are accessed from users
within NC, so the next approach would be to fake these Entry-Guards
(IPs) from within the country (Lets setup a Tor-Node inside NC, that
uses the same IP as the Tor-Node that would be accessed from outside NC)...
Isn?t Kim Jong-UN a smart guy somehow? ;-)

O.K., I found a workaround, I edited the File start-tor_browser and
inserted a command at the beginning, that deletes the State-File in
