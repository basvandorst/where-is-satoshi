@_subject: Stop TOR from building circuits in the background? 
I am using the -controlport Commands to build custom Circuits.
My problem with this is that I cannot trust TOR to use these circuits. It keeps building new ones which were not requested by me via the command interface.
I can drop all circuits, build 2 new ones, refresh the circuit list and there are more than 2. Can I deactivate this feature without recompiling?
thanks in advance
