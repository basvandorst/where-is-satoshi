I have been running Tor in non-exit mode for much of the last month and am seeing cell fullness almost always over 90%

@_subject: [tor-talk] new non-exit relay under-performing? 
I am new to Tor, trying to figure it all out so I can operate a non-exit I have a 15/2 mb/s service
At first, I left the default setting as allowing >1.5 mb/s
I got very erratic behavior.
Later I set the bw to custom settings of 55mb/s with a burst of 75mb/s
I limited other aps so that at least 100mb/s upload bw was idle, available for Tor exclusively.
After a week, Tor is running at a trickle. On the network, I am seeing my advertised rate as 9-11mB/s and feeds minimal, 0-5mB/s and though I have had Tor connected for over a week now, the network is reporting just a few hours of uptime.
Here is a list of daily highs and lows for the week so far:

I read arma's recent article on /*The lifecycle of a new relay */at  it doesn't match what I am seeing. Or at least what I expected.
Why would my advertised rate be reduced to 9 KB/s when I can source more than 10 times that. Note on the 6th day I served up 1 GB/*.*/
Another thing I noted was on the 5th day there were 3564 circuits open, but on the 7th, just 32.
Will it get better?

I know change logs are included in packages but are they viewable online anywhere? Or do you have to download and extract/install the full package to see them?

I'd suggest a simple link on each of the main site download pages for the current respective change log.

@_subject: [tor-talk] "Safeplug" 
I bought an early pogoplug device.
It was advertised as a means to provide "safe and secure" file access.
This model allowed connecting one's external hard drive via a USB port and connecting via ethernet to WAN thru their infrastructure which ostensibly provided authentication and access control. The idea was you could generate a URL to their server which would, if authenticated than open the door to the files you wanted to share with others. Or you could access your own home files on that external drive from any outside WAN For me, it was the ability to place files i wanted to share online 24/7 and since the device used only 4 watts and the external HD perhaps 6-10 watts more, it had a minimal cost for electricity. Leaving a PC online 24/7 as a fileserver costs $15-25 per month in electricity where I live, so potential of saving 80% of that was a boon.
I started the mandatory device registration process to get it going, then, before clicking the final "OK", decided I'd like to look at the linked Terms of Service since they were quite vague about how all the magic happened. I was curious.
Turns out, this little device used a special version of Linux for which THEY had root access, not you. If you jumped through hoops, you could get root access but it was not a process for normal people. They still maintained control.
With the level of control they had, the TOS was a concern, because in it you had to grant them full legal permission to:
    monitor and log your bandwidth usage,
    the identity of who was accessing the files on your HD,
    the content of your files ("so they could index content and make it
    easily searchable"),
    AND they had your permission to copy all your files (for evidence
    purposes)
    AND...get this... even delete files from YOUR hard drive (should
    THEY determine them to be 'illegal' or otherwise inappropriate..
pogoplug is NOT your friend.
Some geeks figured out how to run a clean version of Linux that didn't connect to pogoplug's content monitoring management service but that is quite complicated. Were Raspberry Pi available back then, I wouldn't have wasted so much buying into pogoplugs lies and deception. Is it far to say I don't trust they? YUP!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor-Talk now a social site? 
Yes, Joe.. I tend to think your suspicion that you might be off base is
well founded.
Scrolling back, I see the vast majority of posts to this maillist are
tor techy related. Given that, the suggestion of renaming it as some
sore of social group is absurd as that obviously would not reflect on
the majority of the content here. Not that we would want to be
anti-social anyway.
I assume your 'off base' comment was inspired by the *FOSDEM Meet-up*
thread. I note it started with an acknowledgement that "*there are
apparently some Tor operators on FOSDEM*". Obviously the point was some
tor users could get together and share some experiences etc. To me, that
seems totally related to "Tor-Talk".
Tor project has at least 6 maillists, and even so focused, I would
assume not everyone on any particular list would be interested in each
and every topic posted to said list. If one is not to your liking, feel
free to select it and click [Ignore Thread]. Works for me.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Open source firewall. 
things like peerblock are dangerous.
Why? They tend to create a false sense of security.
The common blocklists imported to peerblock merely references IP blocks openly registered to corps. No IP 'property' protectors worth their salt would limit their tracking to those IP blocks. They'd use common ISP connections so as to appear to be just another normal user trying to leech/share files etc. They are not going to connect from *.sony.com. So how do you address that? block every user-based ISP in the world?
While you can create your own list of IPs to block, unless you create a whitelist for your friends' IPs and then a block list for the entire world *.*.*.*, the effort needed to maintain more useful lists makes this impractical.
External firewalls, in routers or standalone, merely open ports. Application access control has to be installed on the client PC to catch trojans or phonehome spyware that try to use any such open ports.
