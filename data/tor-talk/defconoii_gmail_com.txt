nice additions, thankyou mike for doing such great work, I have an idea for
you, maybe in the future you could implement a tor-control option like
vidalia as an extention; with of course basic functionality like the " new
identity" option to switch up the tor nodes.  Right now Firefox 3
compatibility will be my favorite addition :)

I am a linux user, therefore I am not interested in xerobank products.
  If Xerobank decides to setup there service for linux I may be
interested in the future. I do appreciate anonym's response, thankyou.
Any other ideas for replacing torbutton until torbutton fixes there
addon for firefox 3?

Gmail with SSL is by default is a more secure webmail provider than Hotmail.
It appears to have a failure mode that is less than desirable when an
active attacker decides to mangle packets.
All someone would have to do to force non-ssl is:
Send TCP reset packets for any connection to port 443. Eventually, a
user will cease his attempts at trying the SSL version of the webmail
service. If he persists, he'll have to login without SSL. Oh no! You
have his cookies and probably his unhashed password!
Basically the implications are endless.
I guess I could just disable persistent cookies HEH

I completely agree, the purpose for tor is to keep your browsing
private, I dont think using digg anywhere is a privacy concern unless
you are digging illegal content that can be used against you.  The
only reason I use tor is to bypass company firewalls and to anonymize
my browsing when I am surfing on sites that could be used against me
or sites that nobody has business in knowing I went to.  Tor can be
used to expose governments to wrong doings and exercising free speech
when others may not grasp that concept and use what you do against
you.  If you are a blogger and you may offend the government or
organizations and these gov's/org's decide to get a court order to get
your ip address you are screwed without using tor, at least using tor
you can safely do things without too much scrutiny.  Now the
government has 90% of the worlds dns servers logged and isp's
backbones building up browsing habits like they do at libraries.
Every time you go to a public library everything you read is recorded
and the fbi/cia/nsa/and other nations gov's have access to that
information.  It is very possible and very probable that the
government is doing these things.  So if you want to exclude yourself
from these databases use tor.

I have been using tor for a while now, and I absolutely love it, although
the only thing keeping me from using it, is the insecurities of the exit
nodes.  I know to truly stay anonymous you should stay away from personal
accounts "but" how can I connect through tor to gmail or other ssl enabled
services without risking my password being sniffed or my dns request being
hijacked.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Yes fortunately not all libraries log although if they are funded by
state and federal governments they most likely allow these
state/federal governments log into their systems, also many public
libraries are not very secure that I have been to and could easily be
backdoored on the library network itself or simply logged through the
libraries gateway.  As for the nsa logging networks, I have seen most
networks affiliated with the nsa according to cryptome but are they a
very reputable resource for information like this?  The only network I
feel safe with is qwest communications, they have actively refused to
give logs and access to their network to the feds.  But the gateways
exiting their networks like at&t are surely logged as well as verizon,
covad and a few other usa networks.  The use for tor is mandatory to
feel safer with a great possibility of these issues.

whatever you do, while in gmail dont exit gmail without logging off,
if you simply go to any non-ssl google site your cookie will be
exposed ?(

It is unfortunate about there privacy policy, but I consider all mail
unsafe, as mail passes through the net from server to server they can be
intercepted, is there any guarantee your mail being sent through the net is
unread/analyzed/archived before you read it?  The only solution is using PGP
and I see you use that which is smart.  We all know the governments of this
world are doing their best to intercept emails and search them for certain
phrases/keywords.  I consider spam detection a privacy concern as well
because they analyze email for certain things.  I was just running dsniff
and sniffed my password from clicking igoogle from my gmail client, it sent
the password in clear text unless dsniff sniffed the cookie.  What is a good
way to enforce a good cookie policy for firefox?
Best Regards,
Yes there is allot of good information in the archives, I should have
searched them, although sometimes old questions have new answers

You should really consider making a debian/ubuntu version, allot of us

happy to see that they have not cracked TOR encryption and the anonymity of
it.  We need to focus more on secure browsers and tools that work over TOR
since they are relying on browser exploits and hacking services on TOR.  I
also think more people should consider being an entry and exit node on the
TOR network, we dont want the NSA getting the majority of TOR nodes, if
they do they can deanonymize it further.  Thanks for the share.

i would imagine that the NSA and GCHQ would try and hack and access as many
High bandwidth entry and exit nodes as possible, if unable to hack im sure
they would monitor the connection from the ISP.  In the case of tormail
they were trying to get anyone and everyone's ip address, im sure every ip
address gathered from that site is monitored and kept an eye on.  Sure they
have a few "targeted only attacks" but in general they need to deanonymize
a large portion of the network so they can pinpoint their attack on a
specific target.  I think anyone who uses Tor is a target, I prefer to use
it over vpn to my tor usage is not pointed back to my ISP.  Also those whom
used Tor on their router or a VPN on their router wouldnt be effected by a
browser exploit identifying their real ip unless it used CSS to login to
your router and pull your ISP ip, but thats what logins and passwords are
