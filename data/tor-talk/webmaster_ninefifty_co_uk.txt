Sorry to butt in on other people's conversations.
3 Questions.
How do I configure Tor to work with Maxthon web browser?
Tor recently tried sending out email messages which my anti-virus program kept spotting and I kept blocking.
Am I supposed to do that?
Is there a .exe program that I can use with my e-mail readers currently Mozilla Thunderbird?
Hope I am in the right place for asking questions.

This is a resend without my signature which I believe hindered previous requests in case you get a duplicate.
