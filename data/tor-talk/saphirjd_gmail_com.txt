@_subject: [tor-talk] Will you also be forced to include Firefox Australis UI 
Hello :)
Was a big fan of "Firefox Old" before Mozilla tried to destroy its
customization with the new UI Plan Australis.
So i saw your TorBrowser Project and i just have the question if you will
be forced also to support this destructive new UI in Future Releases?
If not i would gladly love to use that one from now on!
Hope you can answer that question :)
