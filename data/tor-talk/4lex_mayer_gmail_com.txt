Dear all,
I'm working on a project that involves a secure installation of a
web blog and a Jabber messenger service through Tor Hidden services.
I'm aware of SSL man in the middle attacks by rogue tor relay servers,
how to protect login credential of the administrators and users while
accessing the services? which is correct mitigation approach?
No SSL enabled?
Self generated SSL certificates?
Other form of confidentiality and integrity protection?
Maybe my questions will sound a bit stupid and basic, anyway
thanks in advance for any response.

Hi Mike,
thanks for your quick response. I'm going to investigate a bit more on this,
there's some document where I can find this information regarding the
exit nodes?
