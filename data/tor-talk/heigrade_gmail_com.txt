@_subject: [tor-talk] a question about ip addresses 
I am new to TOR and networking in general and had a question about ip
addresses that TOR connects to.
My question is this:
After analyzing tcpdump data of TOR traffic, I've noticed that TOR
always connects to the same ip address, even after restarts, whereas I
had expected it to connect to different addresses across restarts. Is
this address my ISP?
