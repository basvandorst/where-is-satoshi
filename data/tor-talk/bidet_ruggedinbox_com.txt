@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden service honeypot 
This link is a hidden service honeypot. The landing page includes some javascript that looks shady.
I couldn't understand the javascript or what it is trying to do exactly.
I'm interested in knowing how this affects the tor browser and tails, and
could this technique be used in other scenarios by different adversaries.
P.S. I don't think it's a LEA page, just a scare page, but it is trying to
do something and then failing at it.
