Howdy?  I just started in trying to build this and am
getting errors that indicate problems with SSL:
$ git clone  Cloning into obfsproxy...
error: SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details:
error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed while accessing Similarly with libevent:
$ wget --2012-02-12 16:05:44--  Resolving github.com (github.com)... 207.97.227.239
Connecting to github.com (github.com)|207.97.227.239|:443... connected.
ERROR: cannot verify github.com's certificate, issued by `/C=US/O=DigiCert Inc/OU= High Assurance EV CA-1':
  Unable to locally verify the issuer's authority.
To connect to github.com insecurely, use `--no-check-certificate'.
I'm running OpenBSD 4.9 on this system, sooon to be upgraded to 5.x.
Any help would be appreciated.
