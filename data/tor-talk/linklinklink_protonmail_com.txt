@_subject: [tor-talk] tor browser for android (alpha) from fdroid 
Hi, i missing orfox and not available in fdroid anymore?! Now then i tried tor browser for android (alpha) from fdroid, in the version before it crashed complete with a blank screen, now with the new version 60.6.1 (2015615265) armeabi-v7a only, i can start the app without crash, when i touch the connect button swipe then to  the left to see tor logs, then i have always this error:
Unable to start tor: Java.io.IOExeption: Control port file not created /data/data/org.torproject.torbrowser_alpha/app_torservice/lib/tor/control.txt, len = 0
