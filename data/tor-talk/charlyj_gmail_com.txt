@_subject: [tor-talk] Irish state broadcaster RTE preparing current affairs 
Looks like a journalist for RT?'s current affairs programme Prime Time is
preparing a story on Tor.
Now, a TD (member of parliament) is calling for "open-source internet
browsers" to be regulated...
Is there anyone from the Tor Project who can talk to those involved before
they do anything silly?
