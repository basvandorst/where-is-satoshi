Socks4a takes an unresolved address (e.g. 'foo.foo.com') and passes that on,
so only the final link in the chain is responsible for resolving that into
an IP address.  My understanding is that the other Socks protocols have the
client do the address resolution.  If you are using your ISP's DNS, this
means that your ISP *could* identify the addresses you are resolving.  How
much of a risk you see this as depends on your level of paranoia - I run
without Privoxy and don't lose sleep over it.  That said, I also run my own
DNS server which I would assume would reduce the risk of this attack (can
anyone comment on this?).
There are other reasons to run Privoxy (i.e. stripping info from your HTTP
headers), but I have tried it several times and found it cumbersome and
slow.  One day I will try to hunt down an alternative!

Yes, this is quite right - and that's the point of tor-resolve.  It gets tor
to do the address resolution for you so you can use the IP address safely in
future without risking leaking DNS-lookup info.
If it's a static address, I'd say you're safest just using the IP address,
then it doesn't matter what Socks proxy settings you use.

I hit a lot of 404s because the path I'm going through has a knackered node.
Is there any way the client could automatically deduce bad nodes and stop
using them?  Sure, some 404s are going to be legit, but the majority won't
Failing that, is there any easy way the client could try to repeat a request
using a different chain if a couple of 404s are returned in succession?

That's not a bad idea, but obviously you wouldn't want to do that on every
Perhaps the client could do a restricted number of tests like this per day,
and perhaps test the exit nodes directly once a day or so when the client is
Currently I have to keep manually stopping and restarting Tor, which I find
quite aggravating.

Thanks Roger.  I'll give the alpha a try and see what happens.
Apologies, I see the changelog says "Recover better from TCP connections to
Tor servers that are broken but don't tell you (it happens!);".  I did skim
the alpha changelogs but obviously should have read them more carefully
before posting!
