@_subject: [tor-talk] What is being detected to alert upon? 
Thanks for replying.  I understand it is a spy vs spy type of situation but
what do they see currently?  I don't believe they are seeing it by the IP
addresses (or so they claim).
Is it something in the handshake the is triggering the alert?
