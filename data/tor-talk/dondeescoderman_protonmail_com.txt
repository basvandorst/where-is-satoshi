@_subject: [tor-talk] Coderman's taobios-v2.tar.bz2 
============================== START ==============================
Saludad Tor-Talk!
A while back Coderman posted:
“[tor-talk] How does one remove the NSA Virus off the BIOS Chip as described by Snowden in the ANT Program
here's some fun for you:
$ sha256sum taobios-v2.tar.bz2
interesting details in both samples!
( L2 is config only PDoS via UEFI BIOS :)
This appears to reference BIOS recovery exploit to launch malware in SMM. I am trying to find a copy of this malware directly, not just the virustotal reports. The peertech.org domain appears to be taken over.
Checking for old versions in archive.org does not yeild result - After seeing CCC Camp presentation on Sednit UEFI malware -  - I am reminded of this.
Does anyone has it?
