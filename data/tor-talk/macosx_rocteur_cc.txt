I tried to post this before but it never got to the list I think. I wanted to subscribe to ProtonMail, which I discovered from reading posts here on this list.
I wanted to get your opinion, is ProtonMail a good solution for encrypted mails or should I look at alternatives.
I?ve searched and read quite a few articles and I understand that nothing is really secure .. I also have my own Debian server on the web so I?m open to suggestions if any of you has an opinion.
Thanks in advance,

Valid points but apart from HTML only not a big deal if not used in mailing lists.
You did not recommend a better alternative ?
