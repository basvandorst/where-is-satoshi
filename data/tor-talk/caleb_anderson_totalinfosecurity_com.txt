@_subject: patch to tsocks preventing dns leaks and handling .onion addresses 
A colleague and I have patched tsocks to prevent dns leaks and to
handle .onion addresses when using tor.
Only tested to the extent that it seems to work, so if do you find any
bugs please get back to us. Also, unfortunately we didn't know about the
tor-controller interface when we wrote it, so I guess that's going in
the next release.
