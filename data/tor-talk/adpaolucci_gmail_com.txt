This is not that type of mailing list, and you shouldn't solicit illegal
software on a mailing list that is frequented by federal agents. I would
suggest you look towards the almighty Google for your answers.

So what you're basically saying is that you are more secure and anonymous
if you run your Tor connection as a always on relay and access the Tor
network via that relay?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Multiple interfaces on a bridge/relay 
Hey guys,
I have a Tor relay that I am going to be setting up soon for an
organization I'm with and I have 3 problems I wanted to bring up to you
1. Should I have a VM for each interface I am going to have? If I don't
need to how can I set this up to have bridges and relays?
2. I have 3 IPs that are separate from our main IP block and I wanted to
make non-bridge relays, and up to 10 that are part of our main IP block
that I was going to use for bridges. The problem is we are a
Pirate political party and I'm not sure if those IPs in the main block
would be blacklisted in countries like Iran/China because our website is on
that IP block also. Should I put the nodes on my main IP block as relays
and the ones separate as bridges?
3. For the VMs what should the specs(RAM/HDD) be?
Thank you for your response(s)!

Hello Gents,
I made a disturbing discovery for me and my fellow Canucks today when I was
sitting at a Tim Hortons(very popular coffee chain in Canada that provides
free WiFi) enjoying my coffee while working on my laptop. When I went to
venture to torproject.org to go lookup some documentation I encountered a
invalid cert page from chrome, upon further investigation I found the cert
that the server was providing was from a that provides IT services to said
coffee chain. I also quick popped up nmap and did a quick traceroute and
found the server not to be one of the ones regularly in the tor projects
regular pool.
At this point I am not sure how to proceed to see that this injustice is
Below is a link to screenshots that I took and a export version of the bad
