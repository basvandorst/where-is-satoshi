The first problem that I see with this is the '5 hours average.' If a
malicious group got an ASIC but the poor guy from who-knows-where has 10yo
hardware, it may be impossible to balance the cost of doing a 'torslap.'
A bigger problem might be getting people to accept 'torslaps' because it
could be a lot of work. Wikipedia might get an implementation, but what
about the rest of the websites that block tor traffic? And would you really
be willing to do a torslap for every website you wish to register for?
Would it be possible to have "tor-authentication" in the same way that
there is "google" or "facebook" authentication? (could it be
decentralized?). Bascially, there's an account authentication network/api
with a list of verified tor users. Becoming verified would be as simple as
doing an expensive hashcash (and perhaps a market would spring up to sell
these accounts, not a bad thing if the price is high enough). Accounts
associated with abuse will be marked as abusive (that may be hard, but
maybe you could have a table that lists all the parties who have pegged an
account as abusive). Then, you could register for a website by confirming
your identity against an account that is both difficult to acquire and not
associated with abuse. This type of solution would draw on technologies
that are already partially accepted by the internet (IE using a third party
to log in)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor's reputation problem with pedo, 
Part of the problem is that Tor is really inconvenient to use. The only
people who hang out on Tor are criminals because generally, it's only worth
the trouble if you are a criminal.
Bitcoin faced the same problem. Bitcoin was used primarily by criminals
until it became more interesting for other things. If there were more
onions on tor non-crime related that were interesting in ways that
clear-web sites are not interesting, Tor may be able to overcome it's
reputation. It will also be an easier transition if using Tor is made to be
as convenient as using the normal internet.

On at least some level I can understand blocking porn and violence. But why
would you block things like bulimia and anorexia and suicide?
On a personal level, access to suicide related literature helped me out
during a depression.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Speculation: Next 10 years of Tor? 
I hope that onion routing comes a long way in the next 10 years, but I'm
not necessarily for tor still being around. Right now it's needed because
there's no good replacement, but I think that a better future would have a
prominent onion-routed meshnet instead of Tor, especially if lots of the
routers in the meshnet were solar powered and undocumented except for being
documented by their neighbor routers.
But right now Tor is one of the best tools we have. I would like to see
ways to make relaying easier - I've never been able to set up a relay
because I've always been behind some firewall (EG my community college)
that has stopped the relay. It's been technically beyond me to establish a
relay, and while I'm sure I could figure it out it hasn't yet been worth
the effort to me. I think Tor would have a lot more relay and exit nodes if
under all situations setting up a relay was as simple as hitting a button.
I think it would also be good to see the rest of the web standards form
around tor-level security. Right now you mostly disable javascript and
entirely disable flash through Tor, because they are insecure. It would be
nice if the full web was secure enough that Tor could use the full web
without vulnerabilities. This is the type of thing that the devs can't
really help, it's more up to the web community as a whole to take a stance
behind secure practices.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Until there's a REAL effing way to communicate, 
I can only speak for myself, but I stayed away from mailing lists when I
was a 'newb' because they seemed strange and technical. This is also back
at a time when I did not use email very often.
I think that how much you use email is closely related to how much you like
mailing lists. As someone who checks email every day, I am very partial to
mailing lists, it allows me to monitor everything that comes through the
list. Forums hurt my eyes a bit more, and often I can't figure out which
threads have valuable information.
But there was a time when I used forums a lot more than email. I read
everything that would go through my favorite forums, and keeping track of
threads was much easier.
Ultimately, I think that having an email list and a stack-overflow is just
fine. If we had forums we would need knowledgeable people to read every
thread that got created (or at least every thread that got created in their
particular sub-forum). Right now I'm not sure there are enough people ready
to read the forum. I wouldn't read a forum, I'm only on this list because
it's convenient through email for me.
And I don't see why there can't be an unofficial tor forum. If you want one
so badly make it yourself, and see if people populate it. If the forum you
make gains enough traction on its own, I'm sure it would gain official

@_subject: [tor-talk] HTML5 video and Tor anonymity. 
I don't know what I'm talking about, but here goes:
If you were to put flash in a "sandbox" that had a fake IP address, might
that make the sandbox incompatible with the tor network? When you are
communicating, even over the tor network, your IP address is critical so
that servers on the other end know where to send messages. That means that
at the very least you have to know your own IP address. If the flash
sandbox had a false address, the network might reject communication
altogether, or it might simply be unable to return the messages to the
right spot.
Am I incorrect?

What if you had something like exit nodes that required proof-of-work or
bitcoin-to-use in order to be used, as per-choice of the person running the
node? You would have a bunch of 'unsafe' exit nodes that behave like exit
nodes today, and then a bunch of 'difficult' exit nodes that require user
effort (maybe even per-packet) to use, on a scale small enough that its
just like adding 20s to your ping, but enough that it puts off abusive
users. You could also make it so all hashes have to be computed real-time
(require a timestamp within 5 mins, for example), so that an attacker
couldn't use an ASIC for a day and store up 50GB worth of packet-abuse.
I think the goal would be to make abusing these nodes annoying enough to
use abusively that other options (unrelated to tor) are more attractive to
abuse users.

Are we sure this is a bug? Even when a page is in the cache doesn't it have
to communicate with the server to verify that the cache hasn't expired?
Perhaps this is what you are experiencing.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor's reputation problem with pedo, 
Except I think that in this case Tor is a bit more like a gun than a screw
driver. The good purposes aren't always obvious and the nefarious purposes
are on the forefront of public attention a lot more. It's not a perfect
analogy but I think you see what I'm getting at.
The purpose of Tor is to liberate people from state control and censorship.
Informally, the purpose of Tor is to help people break rules. We support
Tor because we want oppressive rules to be broken but ultimately it's an
anarchist tool, and that's something that's not going to sit well with the

@_subject: [tor-talk] You could use ModX to create .onion sites, 
I'm not sure if this deserves its own thread, but I've been looking around
for a decent guide on building your own hidden service. The idea of course
is to be perfectly safe, even in the event of a highly trafficked site that
has content which would draw the attention of many authorities.
It looks like the whonix solution is the most complete so far, but I
haven't yet found a guide that lays out in very specific steps 'here is
what will give you the best chance of staying undetectable.' Most guides
just give you threat warnings and things that you should avoid, instead of
a whitelisted set of technologies.
