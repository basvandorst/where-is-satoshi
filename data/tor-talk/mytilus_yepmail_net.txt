@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser advanced configurativian details 
Hi! Testing my first post here with the following questions about TorBrowser: At first, why the port number difference between 9050 in Browser when set to 9051 in Vidalia, is that wrong or just some tech specials done by the factory (you)? Tor Browser Options ... Advanced ... Network ... Settings ... Manual proxy configuration: SOCKS Host: 127.0.0.1   Port: 9050 * SOCKS v5 No Proxy for: 127.0.0.1 Vidalia Control Panel Settings ... Advanced ... * Use TCP connection (ControlPort) Address: 127.0.0.1   9051 Then next, why the Tor Browser works as good as well, since I'm only allow through the firewall run Tor and then the Browser, but completely deny Vidalia from go out of my firewall, is that OK or have the Vidalia any important stuff to do by it self out on the internet, if I let it through the firewall? And last, why the "Unable to connect" often goes up very fast (directly when click) but then after a few re-clicks it stays longer on wait (some seconds) and then works fine but next surfing click the same error again and so on? Thanks in advance, if answering the questions above!

First thank you very much for answering my question for Tor Browser configuration. It is important to stay anonymus in the research for the truth out there (I'm not hacking, but still). Now I would like to ask, is there are anybody here who works/study at the University of London and able to do a pretty deep research in some archive there for an old case of interest? If so, please contact me directly by email rather than by the list, thanks.
