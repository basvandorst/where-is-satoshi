ever since TBB 8, there's the new moat way to obtain private obfs4 bridges through a CAPTCHA. In the following webpage it's stated meek is used in order to communicate with the Tor bridges database. Now, my question is : which ones ? In my country, domain fronting for Amazon and Google are unavailable, so the only meek_bridge still working is the meek_azure one, which isn't going to last. So what will happen when it will shut down ? What alternative solutions TBB will come up with? Second question : how is the information concerning the private obfs4 bridge protected during the inquiry ?

when living under an oppressive regime with draconian Internet censorship, it is crucial for me to be able to connect to the Tor network without arousing any suspicion and to be sure I'm not connecting to a malicious entry-node or obfs4 bridge.
The only way for me to bypass DPI is to use either the meek_azure bridge (which will be pulled) or the private obfs4 bridges (the public ones or those integrated in TBB are obviously blacklisted)
I guess that connecting to Tor through meek_azure is as safe as it can get, but how can I be sure about the obfs4 bridges ?
You know, I need to try at least 4 or 5 obfs4 bridges before I find one that actually works. That means that the others are either down or already blacklisted by the gvt apes. This means I'm already broadcasting the fact that I'm trying to connect via a obfs4 Tor bridge. Not very anonymous indeed ...
So would there be a way to (pen-?)test a private obfs4 bridge as being non blacklisted and actually usable without really trying to connect to it and alarming my ISP and DPI the like ?
This seems like an overlooked security and privacy issue with a lot of possible consequences.
Same thing for the entry-nodes. How can I know for sure the randomly selected one isn't rune by some gvt trol ? Would it be possible for people like me to have a small list of absolutely trustworthy entry-nodes I could manually set as entry-node ?

Ok, so basically I have to stick with trust... kinda dangerous really in my geographical location.
I know there's a lot of talk about the pro and contra of using some kind of VPN before entering the Tor network, how it can deanonymize you and how you basically still have to trust someone.
But still, in order to defeat the possibility of a malicious entry-node or to avoid having my ip broadcasting i'm connecting to blacklisted obfs4 bridges, wouldn't a "trustworthy" VPN tackle that issue? I'm thinking of providers that employ a mix of obfuscating servers, like PSIPHON. It obfuscates a SSL layer with an http one and is conceived especially for activists living under censorship.
So ok, one could state: maybe most of the ip's of those servers (even being over 6000 worldwide) are known to the gvt trolls and they're just letting you through in order to get information about you. That's right, but then one should add another security layer by connecting over public wifi and not home router and f.ex. spoofing MAC addresses at every connection.
It would still be a protecting layer before connecting to the entry-node, even over a obfs4 bridge.

ok, so for once i'll keep my fingers crossed for Microsoft...
How should I imagine the connection until the Azure server. What does it tell the DPI ? Just that I'm connecting to a close-to-my-country-based Microsoft CDN ?
On wikipage it's stated that
The technique works by using different domain names at different layers of communication. The domain name of an innocuous site is used to initialize the connection. This domain name is exposed to the censor in clear-text as part of the DNS request and the TLS Server Name Indication.
So a meek request is sent in clear-text. What exact information is given ? The exact ip address of the Azure server, its geolocation ? Could the DPI find out that this is being used for bootstrapping Tor ?

Or they don't want to ruin their standing with the client who
has the name that is used in the SNI (and who takes the loss
when china should decide to block that b/c it's used by fronters).
Can you elaborate upon that for the noob I am. If i understand you correctly, when using domain fronting, Tor basically spoofs or "hijacks" the ip address of an existing Azure server client ? What exactly is in the SNI : the name of the Azure server or some kind of information of a real client using that service ?
What could China block ? The ip of the real client who was spoofed ?
What would ESNI (encrypted SNI) bring into the mix concerning meek connections ?

The IP address of the Azure server you're connecting to.
In the case of meek-azure the firewall would also see that you supposedly want to connect to
"ajax.aspnetcdn.com", which is a common domain used by websites that are hosted on Azure.

Ok, correct me if I'm wrong. Is this what happens in a meek request :
1. unencrypted http request with the hostname I want to connect to in cleartext.
2. encrypted https connection to the hostname.
3. encrypted (http?) relay connection to the Tor entry node.
Ok, so here is my question : this 'some service' is this some kind of dummy request, like an empty formular that just mimics the looks of a real request, or is this actually a real-world request with an actual website. The reason I ask is if the latter is the case (some real website hosted on a Azure server), it might contain information the DPI finds harmful or compromising for some reason or another to the gvt, and so, beacuse I don't know what 'some service' is actually being used, I might very well be playing Russian roulette with the DPI.
Well, if the hostname is sent in cleartext, that shouldn't be too much of a problem...
