@_subject: Bandwidth requirements for mirroring relay directory 
Basically, what they mean is that if running a relay isn't using as
much throughput as you want it to, you should enable directory
mirroring.  The mirroring is throttled to the same quota as the
traffic is, so the amount of bandwidth used to mirror is up to you.

@_subject: Traffic on a node 
I'd just use the throughput graph in Vidalia.  If there are unexpected
spikes, then people are using it.  It'll take a few hours before your
node gets popular enough to attract much traffic.
Look for your node here:

You need to have two of these three ports wide open: 80, 443, 6667.
No, I don't think it's fair that you have to open unencrypted ports to
be given the Exit badge.  But, yes, it's just a badge, and people will
still use your exit even if you don't have the badge.

The first seven are set by ExitPolicyRejectPrivate 1.  Set it to 1 to
allow these addresses (I do) if you are not concerned with security
problems associated, or wish to be more selective blocking networks.

@_subject: Reregister after key change? 
The reason there are no instructions anymore is because the naming of
routers is now automated.  You just have to wait a while for the old
one to expire then a while more for the new one to be named.
