@_subject: [tor-talk] =?utf-8?q?Each_TCP_stream_a_new_circuit=3F?= 
is there any possibility to divide up each TCP connection into a single tor circuit? What would be the effect on the usability of Tor?
Or is it a complete nonsense?

Hash: SHA1
I managed to build an image for my Carambola2 board these days, I also
compiled Tor for it. So technically it is possible (afaik there are
also Openwrt versions of Tor in their repo's). But Tor (0.2.5.10)
failed to start, I need to investigate why (I will do this these
days). But technically it is totally possible to run a HS on Openwrt.
(afaik ;) )
What archicteture are you using?

The little flash on the device could be a little tricky, I hope it
will work. Too bad that it does not have a USB port. But give it a
try! I would be interested if it works.
Great! Good luck with that. If you have any questions feel free to
ask. I managed to create a HS on my board now, it works flawlessly.
Tor is complaining that OpenSSL does not has all ciphersuites
compiled, but compiling all of them can lead to a huge binary. Maybe I
will try it  in the next days to cross compile OpenSSL and install it.
But it should not lead to any serious problems to do not have all
ciphers installed.

first of all, this is the Tor talk list, for support on Tails see the
official Tails support channels: A list with problematic USB sticks is maintained here:
Maybe your USB stick is also in this list? If not you could file in a
bug report so it could be added. (I had a similar issue with a Sandisk
Cruzer with the progress bar, I just bought another one and it worked
(some cheap no-name vendor))
There is another thread on the Tor mailing list regarding to ensure
the integrity of a Tails copy:

@_subject: [tor-talk] IBM says Block Tor 
I will share my experience with getting into Tor out of my companies
network (one in the top ten of the biggest employers in Germany):
The website torproject.org is blocked entirely, but nearly all mirrored
websites do work. After downloading Tor I just had to set up the proxy
in the network settings of Tor. It worked right out of the box. I was a
bit surprised because we have a bit strict access list for websites and
a really high security standard. (and I do not understand the blocking
of the Torproject website). (maybe I should try to get an OONI-Test in
Of course it's every employers own decision to allow or deny certain
websites since it's their corporate network. But claiming Tor as "bad"
and malicious (IBM) is not the reality. But I am waiting eagerly if my
employer decides to block Tor entirely.

I just wanted to say thank you to everyone contributing to Tor and all
regarding projects. I had to give a presentation in class of my
vocational training and of course my topic was Tor. And as my result I
scored 100 of 100 points (: Thanks for providing all the documentation
and graphics I could use.
Keep up the great work!

I also do not get them. I think it has a lot to do with habits and the
fact that it's used "nearly everywhere" (e.g. at work). So people get
used to it and develop a dependency of Windows and all Redmond
products (same goes for Apple stuff or Android). I really do not know
how to get my friends/family away from those corporations besides
telling them that it's bad and offering help to break out of the
ecosystems. (They keep telling me "Windows is not that bad, it got
really good" and that it "just works" and looks cool). Crazy
world...solely the price of these products would drive me nuts.

I think a big impact on something like blocking are crimes (e.g.
(child) pornography, drugs, weapons, terrorism -> "the four horsemen
of the infocalypse"). The media also play a major role in the
reputation of an anonymity network in reporting about scandals (or
making up these).
