@_subject: Firefox extension "SafeCache"? Thoughts? 
Has anyone used Collin Jackson's plugin "SafeCache"   ?  Opinions?  Is is OK to use in conjunction with TorButton?

This is why I was considering using SafeCache; are
there attacks where the cache could be read, accessed,
etc? Will do.
BTW, "SafeHistory is not needed because you
incorporated some of Collin Jackson's code into
TorButton, correct?

Hi Mike,
I noticed that you added links to Google search plugins for Firefox on <  > .  I would like to suggest that you also add a link to the search plugins for Scroogle <  > as Scroogle is a much better alternative than Google (IMVHO that is).

@_subject: Cool Find: IP checker using  Google maps; works with TorButton 
I found a page today and I thought others would be interested in it too.  The page is a simple IP checker but it also uses Google maps to show the physical location of the exit node (in terms of Tor).  The Google map works when using TorButton* (w/Firefox of course) but not when JavaScript is completely disabled.
* I have only used TorButton v1.1.8-alpha with this IP checker

I do not have issues or complaints but I do have a
question and a possible feature request.
a) Why is JavaScript not disabled by TorButton?  Does
"hook dangerous javascript" make using JavaScript safe
with Tor?
b) Would it be possible to have TorButton
automatically clear the cache, unprotected Tor
cookies, etc when a NewNym signal is sent (for example
by Vidalia)?
Thank you for your efforts

Yes, as that is required to achive a truly new
identity via. NewNym (along with clearing cache, etc).
 Maybe put a warning up when TorButton NewNym is used?
I agree.  While on that topic, would it possible to
have TorButton clear the cache of Polipo/Privoxy?  I
know the Polipo cache can be cleared from command line
but I do not know if this is possible with Privoxy.
Thank you

One last feature request ;-).  I use RefControl to
spoof the referrer by using the current site's root as
the referrer (the "" option).  Would you be
open to adding referrer spoofing in TorButton?  Could
it be as easy as taking code from RefControl?
Thank you

The way I see it there are two reasons to use NewNym:
1) To change ones's pseudonym identity (IP address of
exit node) to a new pseudonym identity.  In this case
all cookies, cache, etc should be cleared to insure
the new pseudonym identity is not correlated to the
old pseudonym identity.
2) To try and find a faster circuit when the current
one is too slow.  When I am surfing and my browsing
session seems too slow (even for Tor) I may use NewNym
in the hope the next circuit will be faster (which
generally seems to be the case).
In either case NewNym (New Identity) should be used
with care.  I think most non-tech Tor users do not
fully grasp issues/concerns with NewNym.  It seems
many Tor users view it as a silver bullet that will
automatically increase anonymity.
Not sure what you mean here.  I clear cookies after
each time I use yahoo and yahoo is still able to send
me new cookies.

@_subject: Incognito Live CD using Polipo 
>> censorReferer=maybe
  > while not breaking most sites.
  You should use RefControl <  > to spoof referrers headers, not Polipo, as RefControl does HTTPS and HTTP.  The nice thing about RefControl is it can be set to the  option which will use the current site's own root as the referrer.  So Incognito would have full (HTTP/S) referrer spoofing and it should not break any sites (I've yet to break a site with RefControl).

@_subject: Filtering traffic from your node - for exit points 
to limit what users can or cannot do.
What is the nic or key of your exit node?  I'd like to
put it in my excludenodes list.

Personally, I'd prefer that you do not run an exit
node while acting as prosecutor, judge and executioner
for download/upload of perfectly legal files such as:
(a) .rar file; report on human rights abuses
(b) .mpeg file; video about the Dali Lama (re: China)
(c) .iso file; image of a Tor configured liveCD You see there are perfectly legal reasons for these
files (as I'm sure you know)...don't throw the baby
out  with the bath water!
If your so concerned about what your node is passing
then run an entry, middle-man or bridge node, not an
exit node.
more remains to be used in legal ways.
Are you suggesting that usage of Tor would be faster
if this filtering was common place?  If so I believe
you are incorrect (if I understand Mike Perry's
statements correctly).  Mr. Perry stated that even
with greater overall bandwidth Tor will not become
faster.  The main issue with Tor's speed is load
balancing and weighting of nodes...not bandwidth ATM. And again, who are you to decide what is legal for all
persons living in many different countries?  What is
illegal in one country may be legal in another
country.  For example, in many countries cannabis is
illegal yet in other countries cannabis perfectly
legal and is used as a medicine.
If this type of censorship (oops, I mean filtering)
becomes common place then maybe there could be a flag
for these types of nodes (via. TorFlow or Snakes on a
Tor)?  This way we could choose to block these nodes
automatically; though this would reduce overall
anonymity via. reduction of decentralization and fewer
exit nodes to rotate through.
In summation:  I agree with your motivation but not
your rationalization or execution.  There are going to
be bad apples in each bunch; always have been and
always will be.

@_subject: How can I know my IP address geted by the website? 
Run Vidalia and open "Network Map", look under
"Connection" and click on the active circuit.  Then,
in the box to the right scroll down and the last node
is your current exit node.  The exit node's info
(including IP) is listed.  This method is very easy.

This was in my message log today and I did not specify
a server or an exit node (if that is what "using exit"
refers to).  Hell, I just re-installed this Windows XP
SP2 and just installed the Tor bundle (Tor v.0.1.2.17,
Vidalia v0.0.14).  I haven't even opened the torrc or
torrc.orig.1 before I noticed this warning!  So I looked into those files and vidalia.conf.  The

those files.
