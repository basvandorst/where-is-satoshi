@_subject: PrivacyNow is a BadExit (was Re: PrivacyNow node has misconfigured 
Hello
Thanks. This brings up a couple of questions. One, The Onion Router.doc recommends against choosing one's exit nodes. Is your recommendation I exclude these naughty exit nodes, that are determined as such by Tor authorities?
The .doc (Section 4.9--Can I control what nodes I use for entry/exit?), says, "We don't actually recommend you use these for normal use--you get the best security that Tor can provide when you leave the route selection to Tor." If you agree, why do you do this? I am assuming that is part of what your post implied or meant, i.e. that you do this in spite of Tor's recommendation.
Two, in my Home Folder/Library, I have two (2), torrc files. one is torrc, the other is torrc.orig.1
The first one (torrc), has:
# This file was generated by Tor; if youedit it, comments will not be preserved
# The old torrc file was renamed totorrc.orig.1 or similar, and Tor will ignore it
 # If set, Tor will accept connectionsfrom the same machine (localhost only)
# on this port, and allow thoseconnections to control the Tor process using
# the Tor Control Protocol (described incontrol-spec.txt).
ControlPort 9051
# Store working data, state, keys, andcaches here.
DataDirectory /Users/zZ/.tor/
# Where to send logging messages.  Format is minSeverity[-maxSeverity]
# (stderr|stdout|syslog|file FILENAME).
Log notice stdout
The second (torrc.orig.1), has nothing in it. Which should I use? And, most importantly, what exactly do I write or enter into this file? I really don't understand this: entry nodes nickname, nickname,...
This is where one does this, is it not? Please be exact, detailed and clear. Unfortunately, what is clear to most of you goes way over my head :()
Do I go to Tor's list of naughty exit nodes for the addresses to input?
I need lots of help here so I'm asking for your patience too.
Thanks very much.

     On Wed, 14 Apr 2010 13:34:47 +0200 Runa Sandvik      Yes, I guess I kind of botched my first message on this.  I should
have also added a request that the directory authorities flag PrivacyNow
as a "BadExit" because it clearly meets the definition of a bad exit.
However, 1) any bad exits that I report I also add to my own torrc's
ExcludeExitNodes list because a) I want it to take effect immediately and
b) sometimes the authority operators appear to make exceptions for some
misconfigured/miscreant nodes, and 2) I wasn't really awake yet when I was
composing the alarm.
     PrivacyNow is a very high-performance node, and it will be a shame to
lose it as an exit node.  (A few hours ago, it was ranked by torstatus as
the  node by throughput.)  However, its owner/operator clearly does not
want to be contacted about problems, so we aren't really left with much
choice.  In any case, it will still be a good entry or middle node for many,
many circuits per second.
     So now I guess I should make the request.  Unless the authorities know
how to reach the operator of PrivacyNow to get his/her OpenDNS configuration
fixed (or switched to Google's open name servers or something similar), will
the authorities please flag PrivacyNow as a BadExit ASAP?
     Thanks.

@_subject: MacFUSE 
Hi.
This is just a follow up on a question I had asked.
On March 20, 2010 I asked a question about a volume (MacFUSE), that showed up in my System Preferences window. (Mac OS X 10.5.2)
I deleted the volume and its preferences but True Crypt won't work.
I reinstalled the latest version of True Crypt and the MacFUSE volume was back in System Preferences.
Now, True Crypt works. I initially asked because when I first tried to uninstall MacFUSE, Tor wouldn't work!!!
That's why I thought there was a connection.
Tor wouldn't work until, I reinstalled MacFUSE. Actually it is more accurate to say, "until it somehow reinstalled itself."
Now, I'm not 100% sure of my memory in that regard as I couldn't open Vidalia/Tor first. I had to go through a True Crypt file first, but if memory serves me, the very first time I rid myself of MacFUSE, it was Tor that didn't work.
that's all. thanks

@_subject: Firefox configurations for tor with Mac ppc 
Hello.
Around the first of the year I asked about FF configurations, with Tor, for Mac, Power PC.
I was given a link to a site that had the Firefox settings used by Tor.
I have been slowly checking each one to see how they compare with the settings I have for my Mac, ppc.
I came to one that reads: extensions.lastAppVersion -- with "value" set at 3.5.7
That was when I realized these must be the settings for Windows and not Mac power pc.
I looked  through or-talk archives and my email to see if I could find that response but had no luck. It was a quick search, I admit.
I googled for settings used by Tor for Mac but got nothing.
I'm assuming that most configurations will be the same for safety, anonymity and "locking down" the browser, but with some variations.
I have found some differences that concern me however. Before I post those, does anyone know of a link I can find "Firefox configurations used by Tor for Mac, ppc" (a mouthful), so that I can cross-check them?
thanks very much

The firefox settings are the same across platforms.  It shouldn't matter
if it's a mac, windows, or gnu/linux.  torbutton and the prefs.js from
the torbrowser bundles should address them.
Again, I say "should" because we haven't spent much time analyzing os x.
 As we build the tor browser bundle for os x, we'll figure out which

Trying this message again for the third time. Hope nothing more goes wrong.
Here are a few configs (firefox-windows vs. mac), that are different and I'm wondering if I should change them?

I'll let others respond to other configuration differences, but for what
is listed above, you should know that localhost and 127.0.0.1 are two
different ways of referring to the same thing.  (It is an IP address
that allows different programs on your computer to talk to each other
using Internet Protocol.)  So what you've listed above is not really a
difference, so there is no need to change those.  (I am assuming you
simply made a typo on the second line and on your computer "localhost"
actually is one word.)
Also, would you be so kind in future posts to put your responses *below*
what you are responding to, like I have done in this email and like most

safebrowsing is checking addresses against known "bad" sites. this list
will be retrieved from google periodicaly. This is the "enumerate
badware" aproach which is inheriently flawed. If you use active blockers
like noscript and alike, you gain much more security (eg, the "whitelist
known good stuff" aproach)
you may want to turn this off since it may leak information to outside.
Those are state settings for torbutton. i dont think you should change them.
Read  for details
cookies disabled on mac. good for privacy. you may want to use a plugin
like cookiesafe to manage cookies in a more controlable way (the "always
off" doesnt work for some sites).
This decides if you get a warning before open urls that will be handled
by external application. Eg, click a mailto://-link and it opens your
mail-application. Your mac will open mail and news without asking if you
click a link.

the extension.torbutton configs I sent above are all different on my Mac so I am assuming you mean I should change my mac to match the "state settings" as you called them. Is that correct?
And what about "mailto", "news", "nntp" and "snews"? I should I make my mac true for them all?
And of course for the first two, concerned with safebrowsing, should I change my mac?
I had found Firefox configuration settings on the Hidden Wiki, that had recommended that network.protocol-handler.external-default be set at "false" and all subsettings for network.protocol-handler.external-default be set to "false".
There are 16 of them; afp, data, disk, disks, hcp, help, javascript, mailto, moz-icon, ms-help, news, nntp, shell, snews, vbscript and vnd.ms.radio.
Subsequently, network.protocol-handler.warn-external-default was to be set at "true", with all subsettings also set to "true".
There are four: mailto, news, nntp and snews.
Thanks for any clarity on this issue for me.

I think the hidden wiki suggestion is correct. this will make FF not
open any external apps at all. opening external apps can be dangerous
since no one knows if those external apps use tor or not and they could
do even more evil stuff.
"true", with all subsettings also set to "true".
Actually, doing some google search i found out those settings are
bugged. Playing with them had no effect on my system which i dont like.
If they WOULD work, i suggest to change them, since then you get at
least a warning window before open external applications.
If you set external apps handlers to false as suggested by the hidden
wiki, those settings don't do anything.

dealed with the problem in some way, but i didnt mind enough to dig

Hello.
In reading: Configuring Hidden Services for Tor I came upon this in Step Three: More advanced tips.
"If your computer isn't online all the time, your hidden service won't be either. This leaks information to an observant adversary."
Does it leak because it is online all the time or because it isn't online all the time? And how or what does it leak?
Also, does one need to be connected (online), to the Tor network in order to "precheck" a Hidden Services site in order to make sure it is working properly? Can it open in Firefox browser offline and whatever one will put on or in their site, can be done without and before, Tor clients can visit? I'm assuming that if one does this and I'm assuming prechecking is necessary, then that would mean the new onion address is not yet advertised to the Tor network for Tor clients to use but it is now part of the database of the Tor servers in order for them to resolve the 16 digit onion URL.
Am I on the right track here?

The first question is, "why a http proxy at all?"
The answer is, because Firefox SOCKS layer has hard-coded timeouts, and
other issues, Personally, I don't use an http proxy, I simply let my browser talk to
tor via socks directly.  The user experience sucks, because you'll
receive untold numbers of "The connection has timed out" warnings,
because firefox won't wait for Tor to build a circuit.  Chrome, Safari,
and Arora (amongst others) don't have this problem.
Once Firefox fixes bug 280661, we don't need a http proxy at all.
However, given the current pace of progress on 280661, we may switch to
Chrome before the fix occurs.
The second question is, "why switch from privoxy to polipo?"
Privoxy is fine filtering software that works well for what is it
intended to do.  However, it's user experience is lacking due to it
lacking a few features, namely, http 1.1 pipelining, caching most
requested objects, and it needs to see the entire page to parse it,
before sending it on to the browser.  Lack of these three features is
the reason we switched from privoxy to polipo.
We've received plenty of feedback that browsing with polipo in place of
privoxy "feels faster".  The feedback indicates that because polipo
streams the content to the browser for rendering nearly as fast as it
receives it from Tor, the user understands what's going on and will
start to read the web page as it loads.  Privoxy, necesarily, will load
the entire page, parse it for items to be filtered, and then send the
page on to the browser.  The user experience, especially on a slow
circuit, is that nothing happens, the browser activity icon spins
forever, and suddenly a page appears many, many seconds later.
If Tor was vastly faster, privoxy's mode of operation wouldn't matter.
We're working on making Tor faster.  However, purposely showing the user
how slow tor can be with privoxy was a huge point of complaint, and not
what we intended to do.
Does polipo have some bugs?  Sure.  Chrisd primarily, among others, is
working on fixing them.  At the current rate of progress on firefox bug
280661, we'll have polipo fixed before mozilla releases the SOCKS layer
fix.  Chrisd even wrote Mozilla a patch and submitted it on the bug.
The final point is that this is all free software.  You are in control.
 If you don't like polipo, but do like privoxy, then don't install
polipo and use privoxy.
The power of choice is yours.

@_subject: Searching for "good" ISPs 
I would like to see Tor stay 3 hops for the purpose intended. As time passes, the developers will make it faster. Do nothing that will compromise anonymity.
Anonymity is on a precipice and needs to be kept from being pushed or dragged over. Something big is going to happen and much is already happening in attempts to interfere with anonymity (Tor), and particularly if something does happen and there is no community available (Tor), to communicate anonymously with, the populace will be in deep stuff.
I personally don't trust anyone who wishes Tor to be dropped to two (2) hops. If one wishes faster surfing, then use the available world wide Spider's Web.
Wish I knew more so I could be a server for Tor but apparently there is no one in my part of the world using Tor, thus, no one to talk to or help me learn more, faster and with better understanding.
Because I don't know very much, I cannot tweak Tor as so many do. Thus, I have almost no problems with it as is but don't know how to check just to make sure. I keep reading but it's way beyond me.

Hi All,
 Sorry for this shameless plug, but it seems to be very relevant to
the topic. As someone said before this is Capitalism and if there is
demand there will be supply.
  I am actually working for a startup company Coldbot (UK),
 and we are running a beta test of hosted Tor
service (still very much in development stage, though). Feel free to
have a look. The idea is to to give customers an option to run Tor
servers without getting too deep into technical details and without
worrying how 'Tor friendly' their ISP is.
  The plans are to have Tor, VPN and some kind of proxy server
services which customers could pick and match in any combination they
  As one of the options the customers could VPN into coldbot network
and use it as the EntryNode their Tor server running on Coldbot
network. Which would be almost the same as having so much discussed 2
hop Tor routing. Quite a few other combinations are possible as well,
including simply running a Tor server either as relay or exit.
  Basically, I am after some feedback and maybe a wish list or
suggestions. What Tor community would like to see in such kind of
service provider?
 Thank You.

@_subject: Firefox configurations 
Hello.
I'm trying this again. Not really sure if it showed up the first time. Haven't had a response on any of it.
I was wondering if I listed a number of Firefox configuration changes Ihave made, would those much more qualified than I peruse them and letme know if they are sound (for better anonymity) or not (risk myanonymity)?
I am using the Vidalia/Tor bundle for Mac OS 10.5.2, I guess on a Unix platform (ppc).
There's a lot of them so maybe I could start with a few or break it into three groups. Let me paste some here and see what happens.
network.protocol-handler.warn-external-default            true
Next 4 are the sub-settings for the above line:
network.protocol-handler.warn-external.mailto             true
network.protocol-handler.warn-external.news              true
network.protocol-handler.warn-external.nntp               true

browser.safebrowsing.enabled                                  false  This feels to me as though it should be true.
browser.sessionstore.privacy_level                           2        new FF is 1 what do these numbers mean or represent?
extensions.blocklist.url                                           delete value   SHOULD I?

Tha'ts all I'll post for today.
Thanks ahead if any one can help steer me in the right direction and I can learn more.

@_subject: Encrypt for browsing 
If I use Tor onthe Spider's Web I was cautioned that I need to take measures to encrypt it. So,using the Tor Browser Bundle from a USB volume, how does one go aboutencrypting? And what does one encrypt?
The first questionI had that was answered was that I could simply look at the URL and add an "s"to http. Thanks to Runa. So, since I have to do a lot of assuming, this wouldbe before clicking or hitting return for going there. Duh, right? But, thenwhat happens if it is changed back to http without an "s"? Does thismean that particular site doesn't do httpS and my anonymity has beencompromised?
I think the firstpart is correct, that the site doesn't, but I'm not sure about anonymity.
Maybe, my questionshould be, more exactly,  what is it I amto encrypt and how do I do that?
Am I to encryptthe USB drive, the OS, which I cannot do at an internet cafe. I have to do allmy web stuff at internet cafes now, because personal internet service here isvery poor. Plus, if I use Tor for that (the regular Spiders Web), which Ireally haven't done, then I am able to access some regular, normal sites thatare blocked. They block many here and for the vast amounts of research that Ido, and I do a lot of it, I need Tor just to get my work done in a reasonableamount of time as far as finding information.
You'd be surprisedat what is blocked. Well, maybe  youwouldn't. Some is so trivial, or seems that way, but to someone, somewhere, andsomewhere in their reptilian brain, they are lacking cells to think criticallywith. They teach drawing here only one way. Can you imagine? There is only oneway to draw the human head, eyes, etc. It's frustratingly interesting, dumbingand numbing in the overall, long-term effects. I didn't know we all look likethat, but we do!
Also, if I'm notworried about losing too much functionality by using NoScript, is it possibleto put NoScript into the Tor Browser Bundle with Firefox? Does it attach itselfto Firefox like a leech? You know what I mean, I hope. :)
You people arejust so brilliant, understanding this stuff. You all must have come fromanother planet, but I, crawled. This I am sure of.

HOW?dy.
 However*, as the documentation says repeatedly, use HTTPS wherever possible, *especially* when communicating sensitive information that could lead back to you.
How does one do this? Do I simply look in the URL bar and add an "s" if it is missing. And, I too am sorry for the "basic-ness" of my question.

@_subject: NoScript, Tor and Firefox 
Hi.
If NoScript is so important, then why doesn't it come in the Windows bundle for use with a USB?
My limited understanding is that this is sort of a complete package, with configurations set to enhance and protect the user client. Now, perhaps that only applies to use in the Tor network, i.e. Hidden Services and such, and not the big, bad Spider's Web. Is this an accurate, useful conclusion on my part? I used to use NoScript a few years and versions ago, but read about potential weak points in it or that it might nullify what Privoxy and now Polipo do. Excuse me if my memory is inaccurate but that was the general jist of discussions I read. It might have also been mentioned that configuration settings in Firefox could be changed by NoScript but again, I'm just trying to remember. I'm not real sure nor trying to spread disinfo.
I once was curious as to all the problems users have with Tor/Vidalia and was told that if I use it "out of the box", my problems are less and my anonymity is still good, depending on other factors to be sure. So far, that seems to be the case but tweaking, testing and understanding it in more environments doesn't seem to be in the cards for me this lifetime.

On 6 jun 2010, at 17:47, that happening before but I'm not sure. Is this just a simple, innocuous glitch from time to time? I use it cafes as my internet here sucks so bad it's not even worth the cheap price it goes for. You can ignore the first warning. Tor downloads the missing keys.
Google presents a CAPTCHA to users that are doing a very large number of requests or have malware installed on their computer. If a user on the Tor exit you use has malware installed on his computer you also get the CAPTCHA presented, because Google can't see the difference between the users of that Tor node ;)
Oh. Thank you very much. I only use it at internet cafes so I don't think anyone else is using Tor in this country. I've only seen one server listed on the Network map and haven't seen it since. Wish I knew someone here who does use and is more savvy than I.

Writing ~/.vidalia/torrc is just another way of writing
If you are using Vidalia, it should be in your home directory.
Use the editor you are most comfortable with, such as Text Edit.
"Load" is just another way of saying "open".

Hello.
I have wanted to understand more about these  Vidalia/Tor torrc files and just how and where one "edits them." In other words what do I write, where and in what manner?
I keep following or-talk in the hopes I will glean something from what is posted and I think I am still visualizing the way Tor, Vidalia and Privoxy used to look in my Library from several years ago.
I wasn't really trying to do anything but simply find the file, look at it and see if I am able to understand or figure out just how I would change it (edit torrc), if the need arose or I felt brave enough.
I generally have had no problems over the last 4-5 years using Tor but don't feel I understand it any more than I did then. Now it is much easier to use and I'm not sure I need to change anything but I still keep in mind the idea of being able to eventually become a Tor server. Thus, I need to learn a lot and it looks like Mt. Everest to me. :D

@_subject: Verifying signatures 
Hello.
I've just gone through the or-talk archives from August 2004 to the present, March 2010 and I cannot see anymore. I found a couple of  threads on verifying signatures. One led back to the Torproject web page and leaves me lost again. The other involved using something called ASDF-Install. I am not familiar with this. I've asked this question before but will try one more time. I think I really should know how to do this but nothing tells or shows me how. I really need someone to walk me through this, if someone will. If I cannot get this then I will have to stop using Tor, at least because it seems imperative to know what package I have is authentic.
At the Torproject site, the directions are as follows:
I'll need someone's keys. Okay.
Step one: Import the keys Right. From where exactly and how, exactly.
Step two: Verify the fingerprints. Yeah? How exactly? I still have never been able to locate a file with .asc at the end of it. I am on Mac OS 10.5.2 ppc. Where is it?
Step three: Verify the download package. Right again. "If you're using GnuPG..." well, what if I'm not? I tried downloading that and installing it. It went okay but it either won't open, and then I couldn't find the download at all.  Kinda lost here.
"use the following type of command"    exactly where do I use this so-called "following type of command?"
For instance, under Step one: Import the keys is the following information:
gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 0x28988BF5                What exactly is this?
Is it an address?

Disclaimer: I'm not familiar with the MacOSX operating system very
much, but this could be a start:
First of all, you need to install GnuPG of some sorts on your
Computer. Try this:
If you got that downloaded and installed, you need to fire up a
command shell. Thats a little window into which you can type commands.
Try this address for help:
In that command shell you should be able to execute the "gpg" command
after a successfull install. Try this:
gpg --version
It should give you an output similar to:
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.10
Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
If this was successfull, GnuPG is actually installed on your computer,
yay! Now you will need to import the keys like so on the command
gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 0x28988BF5
This command will look for the key with the id "0x28988BF5" on server
"subkeys.pgp.net" and download it for you.
After that step is done, locate your package and .asc file, and verify
the package on the command shell:
gpg --verify PACKAGENAME.asc PACKAGENAME
Where PACKAGENAME should be the name of the package you downloaded.
Hope this helps,

Hi. Whew! Well I did find Vidalia in my home Library.
These are the three files there:
They are all plain text files. The torrc file has zero kb, nothing in/on it.
The geoip-cache list is not something I am familiar with nor understand
The vidalia.conf file has sections about General, BandwidthGraph, ConfigDialog, MainWindow, MessageLog, NetViewer, and Tor.
So, if I am to edit my torrc file or try and avoid these naughty exit nodes, how do I do that? Am I supposed to type something into the torrc file that Vidalia uses to command that?
In earlier versions of Tor for Mac OS X (I'm on 10.5.2 ppc), I could normally find Privoxy, Tor and Vidalia all in my home Library with their own folders/files but now I only have the Vidalia folder and these three I mentioned.
I still cannot locate an .asc file to check any signatures with.
Still need help. I tried different searches with ~/ .vidalia/torrc but it is always "unfound".
Unfortunately, the help I get feels more like "you have to do this" but not how to do it. Sorry for that.
I don't like this 'cause it makes me feel like the person who kept writing in to Or-talk, consistently telling you all to "unsubscribe me, NOW!" I got a laugh out of that and I did just now too.
That wasn't me, but now I feel like whom ever that was, and lemme tell 'ya, it ain't feeling good. :) LOL
So, bear with me please. Thanks  (unsubscribe me now or else LOL, LOL, LOL.

Hello again.
Don't mean to beat a dead horse but I still am lost. My latest version of Tor (for Mac ppc) is the latest and I noticed that in the Vidalia settings window, there are many words, Vidalia being one of them, that are missing letters, as so, ...dalia
or ..lipo   or ...oxy. In some cases, part of a letter is visible with part missing or cut off.
This is prevalent throughout the window and why I need and want to learn how  to verify the signatures for my downloads.
In Mac, Vidalia is located in the home directory with three files. None of the three have anything remotely close to a file named   .asc.... the one used to verify with.
So, where is it? I tried a search with this:  ~/.tor/  and got more files, but none have an .asc name.
So, at the risk perhaps, of some or many of you, becoming frustrated with my consistent questioning on this subject, I need some real clear, easy to follow Steps to learn how to verify signatures. What may be so perfectly clear to you all may be then overlooked by you as what I might need to understand this or just how lame I am. There is no one in this part of the world, other than I, trying to use Tor and get the word to others to try it. (that I know of) I emailed the person who first mentioned it in their newspaper column in 2004 or 2005 but they have not responded. If I knew more, maybe I could talk more into trying it out because I would be able to help them set it up, run it and go from there. I know this is trivial to you all. Sorry for that, really, but I don't know where else to seek the answer for this.

@_subject: Strange problem 
Hello.
I'm not sure if this belongs here and if anyone feels it doesn't then just let me know, but I have something interesting, at least to me. and my searching has led to this:
I know that Google is somehow involved with Tor though I don't understand it much at all. Just that it can show up in different languages when on the web.
I use my Mac, OS 10.5.2ppc, only for Hidden Services/Onion Forum, but I only used it for the regular spider's web in the past. About 2-3 years ago.
However, in my haste I have neglected a few times  lately, within the last 12 months, to toggle Torbutton on before connecting Vidalia.
What I noticed one day is that some new volume was in my System Preferences called "MacFUSE" and I searched to try and find out how it got there!
I just recently found this, quote "Google provides MacFUSE (File System in User Space) that provides this ability via a secure (SSH) connection, and it's fairly easy to do. Basically, with MacFUSE installed, it's like having the remote computer's hard drive mounted on your desktop..."
This doesn't sound good to me at all. It is supposedly for my working remotely but since I don't use it, then I would have to assume someone else remotely uses it on my Mac and also put it there. Is this possible?
I also found this:
MacFuse is a software that extends the file system support that is built into the Mac OS X kernel by acting as a bridge between the operating system and non-native file systems. MacFUSE understands all the access methods and rules for working with a particular file system and then presents that information so that it looks like and works like a regular volume in OS X.
It says, "This is very necessary for the smooth functioning of your Virtual Machine." Well, I don't have nor have I built a virtual machine. Again, if any think this inappropriate here I will drop it and my apologies. I use my Mac only for Tor and nothing else as far as any internet surfing. I use Windows, the IM Browser Bundle on a USB for thtat and many times can only go to an internet cafe where I live because the internet here is still tin cans and string.
I guess I'm wondering if this is a compromise to Tor in any way since it is on my system and has anyone else run into something like this?
Thanks in advance and Regards

Tor has exit nodes all over the world, and Google geolocates your IP
address to decide what language to use. So if you're using Tor and the
exit node is in Germany (e.g. to Google it looks like you're in
Germany), then Google will show up in German.
Google actually isn't involved in Tor. There's lots of websites that
geolocate your IP address and behave differently depending on what
part of the world they think you're in. I believe hulu.com won't let
you watch video if you're not in the US, and BBC won't let you stream
video unless you're in the UK.

What I've written below is also new to my Tor experience:
Vidalia connects very quickly for me,which is strange since the country in which I live, the internet is slow,spotty and connections can be short, even when not using Tor. In fact,Vidalia's message log never completes telling me what's happening when it isinitially building a circuit for connection to the Tor network. It's just, suddenly I'm connected.
However, when I went to -  check.torproject.org - ,it tells me I am notusing a Tor node and am not using Tor to connect to the internet!  How come?
I used to regularly do several IP checksafter I had enabled Torbutton and connected with Vidalia,  but after the IP returns were the same IP's,  andfrom different days and sessions, Andrew told me that habits tend to stick outto any kind of adversary, so I stopped.
But, how can I now trust that I am indeedsafe, in the Tor network after Vidalia says I am and Tor check says I'm  not?

@_subject: Problem bootstrapping. Stuck at 5% 
Hi.
I don't really need to edit torrc at all. I wanted to gather more information in the form of educating myself on "how to do" such a thing. I have never really had any problems with Tor and one of the developers told me "tweaking it" lends itself to problems. I just want to learn more. There is mention of editing torrc in the manual "The Onion Router" and how to block certain naughty exit nodes or choose which exit nodes one wishes to use. I read about this in the OR-TALK emails and have a very difficult time understanding it and naturally want to. Should I do this? Do I need to do this? Where I live, there appears to be no one I could meet and discuss Tor with, nor have someone teach or show me some of the technical aspects that are mentioned in "The Onion Router".
This stuff interests me but I really don't have the intelligence to "get it" like those more tech savvy or trained than I.
I talk about Tor with people I meet and get to know, and try to urge more individuals to learn about it and to use Tor. I mention to them that I would like to become a Tor server before I die (less than 3,000 days to go now), and so I decided to risk asking this question here. By trying to talk another into trying Tor out, I thought it would help me, at the very least, to show them what I do know or how to do, and learn a bit more in that way or even see if I understand it any better than when I first started using it.
I first read about it in a newspaper column by someone who writes a small tech column about new softwares, web sites, and a small amount of computer -problems advice. Right now I just thought, maybe I could email that person and see if they are now using Tor.
I only saw  a server on the Network Map (1 time), that showed a server in the country I now live in. I don't know if it was an entry, middle or exit node as I really don't know how to "read" the servers listed as, or while, Tor is running.
I just know they say "open", "closed". I would like to know how that list reads. Is it top down? And they usually list three at a time, so am I correct to assume (usually not), that those are the three hops? left-to-right-entry-middle-exit?
For instance, I regularly update the version of Vidalia/Tor for my Mac (10.5.2 ppc) and for Windows IM Browser Bundle and a little bit for Windows, but I usually use the IM Bundle on a USB when I am not at home. At home I usually use Mac. I still haven't been able to walk through the process of "verifying signatures" because at a certain point the page for that tells me "what I need to do next" but I need to know "how to do what I need to do next" which I don't know how to do.
Sorry for my lack of training and intelligence regarding this sort of thing. I think Tor is needed very much today and to be able to eventually become a server means learning more. And by telling more and more about it, I'm hoping that helps a little bit.
Regards. -----Original Message-----

Here it is: The last two versions of TOR have not been documented, thus cannot be trusted. Versions 0.2.1.22 and 0.2.1.21 are the only ones that can be trusted (possibly only 0.2.1.21).

@_subject: FF updates and add-ons and others minor problems 
Hello.
 Is this normal? Does anyone know about this or has had it happen to them?
Firefox started installing version 3.0.18 (I was running 3.0.17), on my Mac (10.5.2), while I was in Hidden Services waiting for Onion Forum to open.
It caught me by surprise and finished the install but then another window popped open and showed me it was putting on Add-ons which I cancelled.
I regularly check my FF preferences, so did immediately and nothing is checked, especially automatically updating or adding add-ons without asking first.
Also, in Vidalia's Message Log window, it used to show the progress of "getting enough information to build a circuit" but now, and in no time at all (less then 3 seconds), the Control Panel says Tor is connected and the message log never says anything, other than the initial starting up logs, i.r.  "this is experimental software", "opening SOCKS", etc. Generally, I always copy and paste my onion addresses and for that matter I do it all the time when I surf at all. In this way, I look at the address before hitting enter and lately have seen lots of addresses in the Onion Forum with "redirects" in the address bar.
Before I closed out, I went to Torproject to check my IP and it was different so that made me feel a bit better. I used to do the IP check right after connecting Tor but the address would be the same IP as my last session and I was told doing something habitually makes an address/client/user (mine/me), stand out.
Thanks in advance. Hope what I gave is enough info. Next time I'll take a snapshot of it all.

Hellol
I just extracted the new Tor bundle browser for Windows, v 1.3.5
Running it for the first time from a USB, Vidalia connected and then I waited a few seconds for Firefox
to open. It did, Torbutton enabled, but this message came with it:
An Add-on was added: AVG Safe Guard 9.0.0.812
I disabled it and had this message:
Add-on update security checking is disabled. You may be compromised by updates.
Did I do the right thing and is AVG now a part of the Tor bundle?
I thought it was supposed to come configured to "not allow" add-ons and such without at least a warning first.
What gives here?

Just  a repost to see if I get any answers.
 Hello.
I don't remember who originally sent me the link to cross check config settings for Firefox with Tor.
I have been doing that cross checking fort my Mac, and noticed these two that are not there. They are as follows:
I have -network.http.sendRefererHeader          "0"           and
            -network.http.sendSecureXSiteReferer    "false"
These values are both changed to                      "2"         and
                                                                                 "true"
when I enable Torbutton.
Aren't these configurations ways that web sites log and track users
and shouldn't they remain "0" and "false" to keep one safe and anonymous?

Sent: Fri, Nov 19, 2010 9:19 am
Some of you may be aware of the paper,"Cyber Crime Scene Investigations
C2SI) through Cloud Computing"
 which illustrates
 feasible method of invalidating the anonymity afforded by Tor.
For those who are not, the approach is this: Someone with a lot of
oney, such as a government, uses cloud computing to release a veritable
rmy of Tor relays into the Tor network. The number of legitimate Tor
elay nodes in the network is dwarfed by those under the government's
ontrol. The chances of your Tor client choosing a government-controlled
"evil") Tor node when building a circuit increase to 99/100. Since one
ntity (the government) controls the evil relay nodes, and 2 or 3 of the
hree relay nodes in your circuit are evil; chances are you have no
nonymity left to speak of.
Does anyone have any comments on this paper? Any reassurance? Frankly,
his is scary.
I nominate this paper as a founding reason why Tor should permit users
o increase the number of relay nodes used in each circuit above the
urrent value of 3...

@_subject: 3 Hops 
Hello to all.
I use the Tor Browser Bundle on a USB as I can only access the internet from cafes in the country in which I live. Using a proxy is now illegal here.
I have several questions.
 I know that Tor uses three (3) hops once it has accessed the internet. If I use Tor to connect to the internet (as I'm assuming the extracted Bundle does) is that done in a 3 hop manner?
When I am using Tor (in the Tor network), then my IP is shown as something other than mine and from a different country. Okay fine, according to torcheck.org
But, what if I go directly to Hidden Services (the Hidden Wiki)? Is that done in 3 hops and what about inside, where the addresses are all .onion? Are those also done in 3's and am I correct to assume that inside those .onion addresses everything is encrypted, meaning I am completely  anonymous while in there?
Now, what about exiting Hidden Services and then exiting the internet connection? Are those in 3's and is there way to exit the internet that is safe and a way that isn't recommended?
Always wondered about that. Once backing out of the Tor network, what is revealed? Is my real IP address now in the clear or simply clear for anyone to see? I shut down Vidalia, exit and everything goes away.
Just curious. Thanks

I don't understand this part of the question.
 Sorry. I was wondering if when leaving the internet (closing out the browser), is there one way that is safer to do this, meaning not revealing information about oneself, as opposed to other ways. Maybe precautions to take? I assumed that if I connect to the internet using Tor then I am "somewhat" anonymous in that my IP address shows one that isn't mine and shows it to be in a different country altogether. But when I shut down the browser or turn Tor/Vidalia off there is a sudden and complete shut down or them. Does this mean there isn't an address left hanging out there in the internet somewhere? Sorry I am not more computer literate and concise with my language. I keep reading but it just doesn't like to stick, unlike my waist.
Something must show the router address shutting off, yes?
I hope this was a bit more clear.

Tor client -> entry guard -> middle hop -> exit relay -> website
So your traffic goes through three Tor relays.

The circuit you use to the hidden service is six hops:
Tor client -> entry guard -> middle hop -> rendezvous point ->
middle hop* -> middle hop* -> entry guard* -> Tor client*
And the ones with stars are chosen by the hidden service's Tor, so it
can get its anonymity from you. Basically, the hidden service design
glues two Tor circuits together.

Everything is encrypted between your Tor client and the Tor client
that offers the hidden service. No external parties get to read it.
I wouldn't go so far as to call that "completely anonymous", given that
the hidden service gets to read it and you don't know who that is.

@_subject: NoScript in version 1.3.10 
Hello all.
I've used Tor since 2005. Started with Mac and virtually no problems as long as I use it out of the box. Of course, I have since learned only a little bit more, like configuring Firefox, disabling plug-ins and keeping out extensions. I did try NoScript for a while and didn't like it.
Moved to Windows and use that mostly as the internet where I live is terrible. I go to internet cafes, all the computers are Windows, and the country in which I live blocks more sites than any other country. Now I've been told using a proxy here is illegal but I do anyway.
Well, I recently downloaded and extracted the USB Vidalia/Tor bundle version 1.3.10. It came with NoScript. Is this correct? Well, Vidalia keeps crashing, usually won't open and when it does I get a Google captcha I cannot get past and have to start all over.
When I finally get past it, Tor/Vidalia crashes so it's hard to see what is in the logs. I tried at first just to look at the Network View 'cuz it was taking so long to open Firefox once Tor was open, and that wouldn't work either and finally crashed Vidalia/Tor again.
The options for NoScript are not really clear to me (I keep going over them though), and the icons don't seem to look the same as what is next to the Torbutton toggle and what it shows in the options window when clicked on. So, how do I disable or otherwise get rid of this NoScript, no want?
Why, by the way, is this part of Tor now, rather than an option one can opt out of? I mean, is this supposed to be the new version and has anyone else had this sort of problem?
I stopped using NoScript because I had found information that it could change settings in Privoxy I think, without a client knowing this, so I thought it prudent to be safe, rather than tricked up with bells and whistles like new and neat looking icons in my browser.
Wish I knew someone in this country who really is a tech and knows Tor to learn from.
Thanks for any help, words of advice or just some vice. That would be nice:)

 hi.
 What is the difference between a Vidalia Bundle and a Tor Bundle, other than what I perceive as the obvious?

What they "have" to do depends on what you're trying to do. The Tor program by itself does the legwork of building circuits and passing data to/from the network. It has no GUI and acts based on settings in the torrc text file. Tor is available on its own in the "Expert Packages" section of the download page, as the only people using Tor on its own are likely bridge, relay, and exit operators who know what they're doing. It's not a "bundle" per se.
Vidalia is GUI program that interacts with Tor and makes its settings easier to handle, along with other nifty features such as viewing the network, logs, etc. The "Vidalia Bundle" on the download page is designed to be installed on a computer you'll be using Tor on regularly. That is, it isn't "portable", can't easily be carried with you on a USB key or CD, and doesn't come with an internet browser. The bundle includes Polipo, which makes funneling HTTP and SOCKS proxies into Tor easier and safer.
The "Tor Browser Bundle" (the bundle I assume you're talking about in your post) is the same set of programs, together with a locked-down version of Firefox, that it designed to be completely portable. You don't have to install it, so it's easy to carry with you on a USB key or CD. Tor, Vidalia, Polipo, and the customized Firefox are all seamlessly started with a single button in this package.
All of this information is available on the download pages and in the documentation, I'd recommend reading through them.

=Thanks Justin.
Your explanation was very clear, and for someone like me, I need that. Perhaps you could write "directions" for others to use, as most I've read seem to be written only for the one writing them rather than thinking and writing for the one reading them!
I do appreciate it and I will continue to read the documentation as per your suggestion. Sure would like to help a lot more people to use Tor.

On the pro side we have a group of individuals whose intentions for

uses such as researching medical conditions and accessing/providing
