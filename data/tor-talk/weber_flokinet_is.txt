@_subject: [tor-talk] Funding Tor Development trough Referral/Affiliate 
The amount of people buy stuff online via torbrowser should be quite low
(besides at some some "silkroads") , any serious online shop like amazon
will block Tor or VPN, otherwise the fraud order rate is quite high.
At least the CC processor / paypal / whatever will block Tor.
