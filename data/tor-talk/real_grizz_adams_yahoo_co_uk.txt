Hi All
I was running Tor on Ubuntu (16.04 & 18.04) and have used it on Windows in the past, now for some reason it throws errors if run from CMDLine (the only way to see what is going wrong) "IP 127.0.0.1 port 5xxx" in use, if run from the icon on dash/launcher it does nothing (well not in the hour I watched it anyway)
Tried both Tor_Browser & Tor_Browser_Launcher with same effect
If I run "KillAll tor" in a terminal then try tor it works "sometimes"
Any ideas welcome

Still the main error is "IP 127.0.0.1 port 5xxx in use" can't remember the exact port number
the other one (if I run launcher from terminal) I stays on "Loading local keys" or (maybe keyring) How do you mean rundirect? I have tried in terminal and using the icons, terminal is prefferd as at least I "see" something, the icons route just "sits" and AFAICS does nothing, The first install was from the (secure) Repos for my version of Ubuntu, but after that I let Tor (when I could get it to run) to update itself, so I assume that comes direct from
