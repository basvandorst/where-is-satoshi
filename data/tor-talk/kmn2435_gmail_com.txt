all of your posts and videos about setting up for to use a bridge rely on an older version of bridge that uses vidalia separately.
Now that everyone can only download the Tor browser bundle that opens as a single browser (mine being a mac), you can not get anything in the settings menu that gives you the option to ?find bridges.?  What can you do to find a local bridge?

Thanks, guys.
This actually wasn?t hard to understand - I just hope someone adds the updated screenshots to the site; I would if I had the time these days.
