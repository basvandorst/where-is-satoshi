hi there :)
if I close TBB 4.0 while it's open bookmark panel, the new session has not default size, but larger - 1230x600 if I see correctly.
I'm not familiar with tickets, so if this is a bug and somebody confirm it - pls report in my place.
sorry for my bad english :)

I download and use tor-browser-linux64-4.0_en-US.tar.xz
$ cat /etc/debian_version
$ uname -a

open some panel - bookmarks (ctrl+b) or history (ctrl+h) - and close the when start it again the panel is active in the new session and screen size is larger than default.
