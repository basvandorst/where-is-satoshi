@_subject: Open DNS 
Hey guys,
I read an article from LH this morning about the OpenDNS service.
Can I use this with Tor? Will that void any anonymity provided by Tor? Forgive me if this is a stupid question.

@_subject: Building tracking system to nab Tor pedophiles 
As a new user (about a week now) and without much of a background, hopefully I can offer some insight.  The installation and documentation to get up and started is very helpful, especially the screen shots.  However I am lost with Privoxy configuration, e-mail config (especially about the smtp port 465 in Thunderbird), and if.. how.. and when I need to  modify modify the torrc file.  I have  subscribed to all the lists and am doing my best to absorb the info. I usually learn new programs by futzing with them until I have learned the ins and outs. However, this is different because the learning curve could do some damage (stories of how Tor users were not protected).
My suggestions/responses to help protect green users like me from those who can take advantage of our lack of information are:
- A hold your hand walk through of add ons to Firefox and Thunderbird to be installed before attempting to use the programs ( just like the set info instructions, they were great)
- A few predefined configurations of Privoxy, Noscript etc. with a WALK THROUGH on how to access them, what they mean and how to tweak them in the future.
- The test server sounds like a great idea. I keep reading about things which break pages and reveal your identity but I have no idea if it is actually happening. Is there a way to set an alert which notifies the user that his/her anonymity has been compromised?
- Again, a list of IMPORTANT things you should not do is a great idea. I don't know if I can use another browser without privoxy etc installed after I have disconnected from Tor and wish to surf as I did previously. Is that bad? I am also pretty sure that I should not use any other programs which don't go through Tor while I am connected to Tor.  Is it ok to use them after I disconnect?
The takeaway from my rambling is that compromises to security and the networks reputation are going to come from users like me, not from a developer or experienced user.  To maintain integrity it is a good idea to devote time to developing better walk throughs regarding use after initial setup and to help new users  from hurting themselves or the reputation of the network.

@_subject: need help with Uninstall for Mac 
I installed the bundled package posted on the site last week. I don't know the Terminal well but this is what I get back...
jason-edwards-computer:~ Jason$ cd /Library/Tor
jason-edwards-computer:/Library/Tor Jason$ sudo -s
jason-edwards-computer:/Library/Tor root# ./uninstall_tor_bundle.sh
bash: ./uninstall_tor_bundle.sh: No such file or directory
jason-edwards-computer:/Library/Tor root#
What am I doing wrong?
Thanks for the help

@_subject: Tor + Hushmail? 
Forgive me if this is off subject...
Does anyone know how to create a Hushmail account using Tor.  The site runs Java so privoxy, no script forbid access.  I don't want to disable them if my IP will be viewed/logged when I create an account. Any ideas?

@_subject: GPG Preferences 
Hey guys...
I use GPGPreference to tweak Mac GNU Privacy Guard. Under the Key Server tab there is a text box which says:
Use the following HTTP proxy to access the key server
I took a guess and filled in  and when I search for keys it seems to work. Did I configure this correctly? Is that program even meant to be used with Tor?

When I use Vidalia to start and then stop Tor I get the following messages in my Log.
Mar 05 15:13:24:072 [Notice] Tor v0.1.2.9-rc. This is experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity.
Mar 05 15:13:24:078 [Notice] Enabling experimental OS X kqueue support with libevent 1.3a.  If this turns out to not work, set the environment variable EVENT_NOKQUEUE, and tell the Tor developers.
Mar 05 15:13:24:083 [Notice] Initialized libevent version 1.3a using method kqueue. Good.

Is everything working correctly?
Why do I get an error message when I stop Tor?
Thanks for the time...

I have some noobie questions if anyone has time.
When I visit showmyip.com it recognizes that I am using Tor ALTHOUGH the information regarding my internet browser, operating system and type of computer I use is still accurate. Am I doing something wrong or is that
