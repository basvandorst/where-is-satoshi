@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden service development 
Is anyone focusing on hidden services? I'd like to hear a status update, if
any is available, on the "Hidden Services need some love" post. I'm
interested in donating to the Tor project especially if my donation can be
earmarked to fund hidden service research and development. It should be
possible to conduct a successful fundraiser to focus on hidden services.
