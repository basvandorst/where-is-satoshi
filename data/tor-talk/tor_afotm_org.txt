I did run a tor exit with only port 25 blocked, did push 850 tb in 4 months
and did got 3 abuses so far, 3 % bad traffic is much to high i think

@_subject: [tor-talk] Facebook brute forcing hidden services 
Hash: SHA512
i really think that this is a good thing, because i think this hidden
service will get a lot attention in countries where Facebook is
blocked. So it will get one of their goals to improve hidden service
scalability and performance which is good for all of us. I hope they
share their experience with operating this hidden service with us.
Also it is nice because i can tell the next time police is knocking at
my door that now even facebook is on Tor. And they know what facebook
is and i hope they will start to accept that tor is not build for
support terror (which still some of that people that i had to talk
with think).
Thanks Facebook, keep this project alive.

@_subject: [tor-talk] please advise on renting a gigabit capable dedicated 
Hardware: everything in the range of a Intel E3 1230 with 16 GB RAM can
saturate a gigabit connection.
Where to rent: may take a look at hosteasy.eu they have 1 gbit unmetered
for 300? and last time i used them they were Tor friendly (and don't
host a large amount of relays atm). Ask them before odering if they are
ok with hosting a Tor exit.
