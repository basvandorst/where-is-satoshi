Thank you Moritz !
I configure the Github repo to respond to relaymap.torservers.net, so
now it's live:  \o/
( personnal point of view: why not map.torservers.net ? )
I'll gather my thought about the map.torproject.org topic, and anwser
another time. I'm in a job related hurry right now !

Hi there,
Last week Luke Millanta released OnionView [1], a nice map showing the
location of all Tor relays around the world. It's not free software,
and using Google Maps doesn't really make me happy.
Few days ago I started working on a similar application. I present you
    It's mostly a piece of JavaScript calling the Onionoo API, using
leaflet.js to build a map.
Onionmap doesn't have many features for now, but I plan to add:
- Filter by relay type : guard, exit
- Add cache for Onionoo data
- Other filters ? AS, BW, ...
Feel free to open features requests, issues and pull requests on Github

Check ( as "my" onionmap, it's built with leaflet/OSM, and sources are
available on Github )
