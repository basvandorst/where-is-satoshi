@_subject: help, leaking DNS-requests with firefox and privoxy-tor 
I thought i have set up the firefox -> privoxy -> tor chain as instructed, but still, i am leaking DNS-requests.
On  i get tor-server ips like 66.239.30.194 or 128.42.98.102 or ...
BUT with etheral  i still see communication with the dns server i set in /etc/resolv.conf:
 DNS Standard query A  DNS Standard query response A 67.15.74.5
What could i have done wrong? I am a bit lost. My setup follows, if you need more infos please ask
thanks in advance for any ideas, joerg
