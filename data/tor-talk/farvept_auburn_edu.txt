@_subject: TOR Blocked at Universities 
I meant clients for TOR were blocked.  Yes, for all students and faculty.  I believe the attacks were from the TOR exit nodes, but I will try to get more information from network administrators.  I have not tried bridges yet, but maybe I will obtain a bridge to connect to test in the future.
can you elaborate on that?
are these apparent attacks coming _from_ the Tor exits or are Tor
clients being used to circumvent network policy, etc?
do bridges work or is this identifying Tor client signature to filter?
best regards,

TOR is now blocked campus-wide at Auburn University (for all 24,000 students) because of apparent attacks emanating from the TOR network.  Whenever trying to run TOR, TOR cannot get past the 10% mark.  Would it have been wiser for Auburn University to block incoming connections from TOR nodes, but allow TOR outgoing connections?  Does this break TOR if incoming connections are blocked yet outgoing are not?
