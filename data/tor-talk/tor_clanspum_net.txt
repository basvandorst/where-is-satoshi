I've butted heads with SORBS a few times in the past (something about
running Tor on a mail server...) and have come up with this:
* Block outgoing IRC traffic.  This sucks, but allowing it will get you
  listed time and time again.  My blocking rules for that are below.
* If you get listed, use the webpage unblock form.  Then go onto the IRC
  server and talk to someone.  Don't wait for them to do it, they might
  not.  Preferably, keep talking to people until you get someone who can
  unlist you.
* When you get unlisted, immediately send notes to anyone who blocked your
  email telling them to fix their shit.  Seriously.  postmaster
  domain) gets a form letter from me.
IRC blocking rules:
ExitPolicy reject *:6660-6670 # IRC
ExitPolicy reject *:7000-7001 # IRC
ExitPolicy reject *:7026 # IRC
ExitPolicy reject *:7777 # IRC
ExitPolicy reject *:8000 # IRC
ExitPolicy reject *:9999 # IRC
I'm sure that this doesn't cover everything, and that there is collateral
damage from this block, but it seems to work for me.
Good luck!

It actually just gives a negative bump to the email's spam score.  Other
lists I read (specifically the postfix user's list) end up in my spam
dir even though I'm filtering them into their own label.  Not all of their
email, of course, but enough.

Nathaniel Dube(njdube at gmail.com) May 22, 2008 at 11:59:28PM -0500:
I ran into a problem with this somewhat recently.
I blew away the default reject list on my node and made a fairly lengthy
one in its place.  As part of that, I allow 587, because it's supposed to
be authenticated, right?  It turns out that a lot of sites out there treat
587 just like 25: optional authentication, optional encryption, maybe some
relaying, whatever.  Thus, allowing 587 through Tor causes some
complaints.  I've still got it open, but every time someone complains I
consider turning it off.
Interesting, there's no RFC standard that says that 587 will authenticate
or encrypt.  The closest you will get is RFC 5068, a best practice, which
     Submission Authentication:
         MSAs MUST perform authentication on the identity asserted during
         all mail transactions on the SUBMISSION port, even for a message
         having a RCPT TO address that would not cause the message to be
         relayed outside of the local administrative domain.
None of the actual standards have a MUST for this.
I'd been meaning to email the list and ask if anyone else was having
problems relaying 587.  So, anyone else? :)

As a point of reference, I run a decent size tor node and have allowed
this traffic for at least a year.  In that time I've received one
complaint about that traffic.  I spent a few hours explaining the problems
to them (if you have your mail server listening on port 587, just like
your port 25 listener but without any spam filters, it's going to suck!),
and that was it.
I get more complaints about port 80 and 443 traffic, as a reference.

Something I might not have mentioned before, but seems relevant:
My Tor node runs a medium-load mail server as well, and I've never been
blacklisted for spam stuff [1].  That seems like a decent indication of it
not causing problems given how rabid the anti-spam people can get.
1: I've gotten blacklisted twice by SORBS for "virus" activities, which
were people using IRC (for bad things, I assume) via my node.  That
doesn't count.

Ugh, yes.  I pretty much can't SSH from my shell server (/ Tor server /

traffic out.
It's really time to buy a new IP or two.

Don't take this the wrong way; I hate the restrictions most US ISPs put on
their providers.  That said, actually, yes they do tell you.  Since you
agreed to their TOS when you signed up, they are free to enforce it.
Denying this possibility is just sticking your head in the sand.  Maybe
they won't ever bother you, but maybe they will.  They can tell you not to
run sshd, vpn servers, Tor, whatever.  They might even be able to tell you
not to surf porn from that connection, mattering on what their TOS looks
Like it?  No.  Live with it?  You have to, unless you find a provider that
sucks less.

My apologies if there's some canonical source for this I'm missing.  I
didn't see anything in the archives of the list for the last couple of
months, and I don't remember seeing anything like this any time recently.
Doubly my apologies if this comes across as a commercial message or other
content that isn't welcome here.
My soon-to-be-former dedicated hosting company, 1&1, has informed me they
are terminating my account at the end of this billing cycle (~1 month).
The reason for this is repeated DMCA notices about my tor node (clanspum).
I didn't get much warning about this.  There have been a total of 5
(including the one with the "get lost" note attached) forwarded to me by
their legal department at a rate of about one per month.  I don't know
what started this trend, as I hadn't had one in the 3+ years before that
running an exit on one of their machines.
They haven't explicitly referred to Tor in their notices, but I had it
running on its own IP, so I can be sure it isn't one of my local users.
Each notice was responded to promptly with the EFF's form response,
tailored to the notice.  Oh well.
Anyway, I'm currently looking for another hosting company.  In the short
term I'll be moving to a VPS so that I don't have a gap in service, but
that's not an appropriate place to run a Tor exit from for a variety of
Can anyone recommend a hosting provider that won't can me for responsibly
running a Tor server?  Or, barring that, help me figure out what I need to
be asking?  My budget is up to about $150/mo.  The current server is a
"AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4400+" with 2GB RAM and dual
250G SATA drives, with an allowance of ~1.5Tb/mo transfer.  Most of that
transfer is/was Tor.  My usage is email, web and miscellaneous shell
stuff.  Other than the tor server, there isn't much going on here that
would cause the ire of a provider.
So far I've been asking about SWIPing IPs to me (so that I can receive
abuse@ and deal with it appropriately).  However, not a lot of providers
are willing to do that without a good reason.
Thanks for any input you have.
As well, as you can imagine, my node is down until I get this resolved.

I've looked at this page, and checked it again right before I posted this.
It is pretty light on hosting companies and seems geared towards home
ISPs.  Important, but not what I'm looking for.
I'll make sure the details of my issues are on there.
I was doing 2-4 and 6.  1&1 doesn't support  and they didn't care much
when I tried I had a run of abuse notices about supposed hacking attempts from the
box about a year and a half ago.  1&1 wouldn't give me enough information
to figure out what was going on, so each time I just verified that it
wasn't a local user and reported that.  No problems.  This time it was all
DMCA, no other issues.

I'm not weighing in on the BadExit issue, just the technical details.
Anyone can use the OpenDNS resolvers without having an account with them.
You just don't get to toggle any of the options without doing so.  I think
that, without an account, you get everything under "OpenDNS Basic" on
their website[1] ("Web content filtering", "Proxy/anonymizer blocking",
"Phishing protection" and "Botnet protection" being the ones we probably
care about here).
Scott: if the current owner doesn't have an account set up, _you_ could go
to the OpenDNS page (via Tor so it come from that IP) and fix their
settings :)
[1] Assuming your ISP doesn't damage your queries for you or redirect outgoing
port 53 activity to their servers, setting up Bind as a local resolver is
super easy.  I'd be glad to help you out with a config if you'd like.

I considered adding something to that like "It isn't what I would do, but
it's up to you to say if you'd be ok with it or not".  I strongly doubt
there's anything illegal about configuring OpenDNS for an unclaimed IP
(which is different than if the IP is attached to an account there).
I'll leave my commentary about the wisdom of outsourcing your content
filtering for your children to a company you have no actual relationship
with unsaid.

They can all see your real IP.  That's how other nodes know how to get
packets to you.
You could configure it to do everything through BitTorrent, but:
1) Don't do that.  The speed will be horrible.  Like, slower than getting
   a second job at minimum wage and making enough to buy whatever you're
   downloading. Even free stuff, which you could pay someone to burn to
   disk and mail you.
2) Don't do that.  DMCA notices to exit nodes by people who don't realize
   the above suck, and will cost us exits in the long run.

Interestingly, I was contacted by the police at some university a couple
of years ago about abuse through my Tor node on port 587 (authenticated
SMTP).  After a ton of explaining what Tor was (at first they believed the
abuser to be a client of mine because his bits were coming from my
machine), it turned out that they had a severely busted submission port:
it was the same as port 25 (so, accepted unauthenticated email from the
world).  The person they were investigating had used this to send email
via Tor to an address there.
I finally explained to them that their damaged configuration was letting
spam through, and they stopped bothering me.  Ah well.
I'd suggest adding that port to the mix, since it should be authenticated
and TLSed (despite the occasional evidence otherwise).
