@_subject: control time spent with a circuit 
I am after advice how to control/influence the time spent using a circuit.
A few ideas from browsing the manual:
- add port 80 to LongLivedPorts
- decrease CircuitBuildTimeout so have more robust longer lived circuits (or
- set high CircuitStreamTimeout to change circuits less often (unfortunately
not supported in my v0.2.1.26)
- increase NewCircuitPeriod so consider new circuits less often
Is my understanding correct? And are there better approaches?
