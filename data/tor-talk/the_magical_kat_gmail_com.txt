What do you mean by 'removed itself'? Was the file never saved, or was
there a point at which something else reverted it, or was it something
else entirely?
Also, which operating system are you using?

@_subject: The best way to run a hidden service: one or two computers? 
The router issue is only relevant if you're exploited, and if you're
running a firewall, get exploited on the root level, too. I'd look into
privilege separation software if you're really serious about security,
specifically AppArmor and SELinux, or systrace if you're on *BSD.
(AppArmor is much simpler than SELinux, though SELinux is probably more
powerful. Personally, I like systrace the best.) Just make sure you
update frequently, and you'll probably be good. :-)

The following options should do what you want:
ExcludeNodes node,node,...
A list of identity fingerprints, nicknames, country codes and address
patterns of nodes to never use when building a circuit.
ExcludeExitNodes node,node,...
A list of identity fingerprints, nicknames, country codes and address
patterns of nodes to never use when picking an exit node. Note that any
node listed in ExcludeNodes is automatically considered to be part of
this list.
StrictNodes 0|1
If 1 and EntryNodes config option is set, Tor will never use any nodes
besides those listed in EntryNodes for the first hop of a normal
circuit. If 1 and ExitNodes config option is set, Tor will never use
any nodes besides those listed in ExitNodes for the last hop of a
normal exit circuit. Note that Tor might still use these nodes for
non-exit circuits such as one-hop directory fetches or hidden service
support circuits.

sure there are quite a few people here who speak Spanish. That said, this
particular message was nothing more than an irrelevant flame, which, I thought,
was better left untranslated.

Google requires you to be able to receive a text message or phone call to
use a GMail account over Tor. This is unrelated to Torbutton's cookie handling
(which was broken but has since been fixed). Personally, I got a friend on IRC
to let me use his phone for it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Ideas to securely implement PGP encryption/decryption 
In theory, it should be possible to prevent JavaScript from reading the
content of decrypted or not-yet-encrypted messages. There are a few
barriers to this approach, but they should be surmountable:
        - The user would need to indicate that they were going to
        encrypt the contents of a text field *before* they did so.
        - JavaScript on the page mustn't be able to interact with the
        data in any way. This would, for example, prevent things like
        editing buttons, GMail's auto-saving, and auto-resizing of text
        areas.
        - When decrypting data, the size of the text in the decrypted
        area will change. Since JavaScript can query positions and such,
        it may
        be difficult to prevent the length of the message from leaking.
Of course, it might be possible to do everything in a new window, which
would prevent all of these things, but that would be detrimental to the
user experience. Also, does anyone know if Firefox even has the
necessary APIs to prevent malicious pages from doing these things?
