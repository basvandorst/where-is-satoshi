@_subject: Whats the use of country.sh? 
My Debian tor package ships with a not very well maintained country.sh.
I think this bash should start tor by hand if i don' t want to use the
autostart script in /etc/init.d/ and if i like to exclude countries.
This bash starts with the lines # Set one or another, but not both, alphabetical order plz:
 # Those countries will be rejected.
COUNTRIES_TO_ACCEPT="AR|US"; # All other countries will be rejected,
those only will be accepted.
# Where to find a routers list:
serifos.eecs.harvard.edu seems to be dead. Is there a replacement for
this url?

Tried google, but couldn' t find a iptables firewall "made" for tor.
Before i write this 10 liner, i would ask the mailing list. Maybe
somebody uses a simple firewall with tor and would like to share it. :)

I am using the Debian testing package with tor 0.2.0.34-1 and I am
getting some error messages in my debug.log. Maybe i can ignore those
lines or not?

Note to myself :) This file is useless. Use instead ExcludeNodes DE,BE
in torrc. DE should be excluded anyway as a standard :)

You should not use the tor network for bittorrent. If you live in china
or maybe the iran i would say ok, but you are living in Germany, People
like you make tor sick.

Yes, i think you did not get it what i want. If i use tor it should be
done from a 100% isolated environment. That means to me:
All ports closed and the environment (tor + OS) should only connect to
verified (via ip check) tor servers and nothin else.

Oh lala. The tor developers should fix this issue. This is a extremly
high security risk for people who need anonymity while using the
internet from inside a "torture country" and use a rule like
ExcludeNodes CN,HK, but are connected to fake servers hosted by the
"torture governemnt" that uses a manipulated country identifier to hunt
enemies. This could be a question of beeing imprisoned or not for those

Sorry for the missunderstanding "sigi". Thought you are the TO. Ok, again, people like M. Bonneti from Italy and not "sigi" from Germany
make the tor network sick. :)

Who do you think you are, Mr. Bonetti from Italy?
People like you should be banned from the tor network and from the whole
internet. If you want music, pay for it. I you want books, pay for it,
but please don' t use the tor network via bittorrent to steal books and
music from composers and authors who worked hard. I don' t know if you
do that for sure, but asking for bittorent support, makes it likely. If
you are really this
don' t waste your time in Slackintosh. Become a tor developer and write
a module that helps to ban all bittorent traffic from the tor network.
