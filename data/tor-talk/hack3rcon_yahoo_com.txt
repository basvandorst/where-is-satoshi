I'm sure my Government blocked Tor.I use a PC and not Laptop. My motherboard model is "Asus B85 Plus".  On Wed, 30 Sep 2015 18:12:11 +0000 (UTC)
First, sorry for the thread necromancy. Thought it was worth responding
too, though, since the OP didn't get much of an answer.
Second, hello Jason, I have been experimenting with various
configurations and OBFS3/4 compatibility. I first noticed problems
connecting to OBFS4 bridges while using Tails on an older ASUS laptop.
I thought it was an outlier until I found several other laptop models
that had similar issues with almost identical logs to yours. I still don't know exactly what inhibits a network interface from
connecting to a bridge but do have some info that might help push the
issue forward and give you connectivity. Also, as you probably
inferred, I believe it has to do with the network device the laptop or
computer is using to connect. "iwlwifi" is a driver that has been part of debian stable for a long
time, AFAIK. This is the driver that a ton of laptops will assign to
the network interface. But on most newer lenovo's and some other
models, a different driver is used and with those laptops, OBFS4 and
sometimes OBFS3 will never connect. My troubleshooting steps have been as follows:
- Try connecting to OBFS4
- Try connecting to OBFS3
- Try both 3/4 but with only ,
? and not including the cert, etc. - Try using a different interface like a USB wifi device, I've had
? positive results with most ralink chipsets.
- Try a direct ethernet connection.
I thought that the problem had something to do with how tails clones
are made but now I'm unconvinced this is a problem. If you connect to
tor via some other setup, these suggestions should help. In most of the configs I've worked on, ethernet has provided me at
least OBFS3 connectivity. In another case, the user needed to include
at least 1 OBFS3 bridge and all the bridges would connect and work, but
if she used all OBFS4, tor directory would never download. Hope this helps.

Can "OONI" help us about finding a way?  On Mon, 19 Oct 2015 00:05:49 +0000
Aloha isis, Thanks for your input; you and I had the exact same thoughts on the
matter. I agree, it's odd, and I was wrong to assume the problem was a
hardware issue, ultimately. Some details that are relevant and were
left out of my original response: - Workstations, whether laptop of desktop (predominately laptops
? though), were all being used as Tails hosts. - The TBB, run in whatever nix flavor, and I even think weird OS's like
? Windows, was perfectly capable of running OBFS4 bridges. The workstations are not all physically in my reach and I have only
recently acquired a laptop that showed the problem. So once I was
finally able to control for the above variables, I found that, if
anything, it's a Tails-centric issue. The problem was replicatable on a variety of public and private
networks. Ultimately, I don't think the ISPs had anything to do with
it; it's not a censorship issue as far as I can tell. Based on where
it hangs, and the eventual work around I figured out, I think the
problem might have something to with building the initial Tor
directory. I almost feel like writing that as a question, to
communicate that I have not grokked the entire Tor circuit building
routine. But, in every case, OBFS3 bridges worked. So eventually I tossed in
one OBFS3 bridge along with a few OBFS4. Voila, Tor directory builds
off the OBFS3 bridge (as it appears in the logs and through viewing
the network map), and OBFS4 bridges are utilized immediately after.
Cancel the OBFS3 connection, and nothing changes; so the OBFS3 bridge
just needed to be there for the initial circuit building. And, if the Tails drive has persistence enabled with network
configuration saved, the problem seems to eventually stop altogether. Personally, I'm surprised practically no one else has reported similar
experiences (I follow the tails mailing list as well). It would seem to
me that Tails is doing something different than the TBB that results in
the bug. Which is plausible; Tails still uses Vidalia, which was
deprecated elsewhere a while back. Vidalia, in Tails, is basically a
hack that acts as an abstraction layer between the user and her torrc.
Also, while OBFS4 sounds like the latest version of OBFS, implying that
the two protocols are similar, 3 and 4 are actually quite different. 4
being closer to scramblesuit or something. Anyways, I've contributed the experience, I hope it saves someone an
hour or two and helps them gain a pint or three! I gotta get back to
figuring out how this baffling Windows registry works...

Thank you so much and I didn't know this problem about Bridges. I just copy Tor Log and nothing else :(.

What is your idea? Can government blocking Tor?
Jason Long transcribed 3.4K bytes:
Hello Jason,
First, please try not to paste Bridge IP addresses and ports (i.e.
"148.251.156.199:443") or Bridge fingerprints (i.e.
"3BECEABD174AE41C5CCC17254A40DD24EC5372CD") into public communications channels.
It's dangerous for you, because now people know which Bridges you are going to
try to connect to when you start up Tor.  It's also potentially dangerous for
other people, since there may be other people using these Bridges.  Lastly, it's
bad for the Bridges themselves, since they will likely now be blocked by several
censors and will no longer work in those places.
To answer your question, it looks like your SSL connections are somehow dying.
This could mean many things.  It could simply be that the router at your
house/office/caf?/etc. is doing strange things.  Or, it might mean that someone
somewhere is tampering with your connections.  Or it could mean something else
I would recommend that you email BridgeDB at mailto:bridges at torproject.org and
request some new bridges.  Perhaps try using obfs4 instead, if you can?

No worries; it's not your fault at all.  I think we should be logging sensitive
info at those levels anyway (see  [0]
Governments (and some other parties, like your network admin, your ISP, etc.)
could certainly block Tor, including blocking Bridges.  There are many ways that
they could do this, some with various consequences (for that government/etc.).
A simple example would be if your government only allowed traffic to
 and then block anything that doesn't look like plaintext HTTP
of someone reading CNN articles.  Obviously, this would be ridiculous if a
government did this, as pretty much all commerce, banking, online education, and
a million other things would completely stop.
However, without knowing more details about your specific situation, I can't
really determine if/how Tor is blocked for you.

 Hidemyass did deanonymize

 dnscrypt throw Tor . A cpanel is often just some php script
 sure it might record ur ip and useragent But that is mostly
 the Web server that does that. If You have a fake usr agent
 and are running Tor You can do like a online browser leakage
 test. I would not(and this is my opinion use hidemyass).

Excuse me, I must allow input to my system? It is so bad :(, I don't like to allow everyone.
You always need to allow some input as well in order for the Tor guard node to talk to your computer. Stateful Inspection is used for this. Here's a complete ruleset to accomplish what you asked for. All output is allowed, but no input, except it belongs to some output your computer previously did.
# Stateful inspection for input and output
iptables -A INPUT -j ACCEPT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
# Allow loopback traffic
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
# Reject any other input
iptables -A INPUT -j REJECT
# Accept all output
iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT
Note that you also want to accout for IPv6 using ip6tables. It depends on your network though.

 This has nothing to do with Tor. It's just
 the general way how the IP protocol  works.
 Without allowing stateful input, you couldn't do any
 useful traffic.  You always need to make
 sure that there's a way to the destination (output)  and a way for the target server to reply to you
 (input).
 But using stateful
 inspection, only input that is a reply to your output is  allowed. There should't be any security
 risk because of this. It's what your  home router is doing as well to allow the
 servers you want to talk to to  reply.

What is my problem? Why I can't use "obfs4" ? You only need to allow input and output for the tor process. And input
for SSH, if you need that. Plus related/established, of course.
In Debian, run "id -u debian-tor". Then use that number (typically 108)
in an output rule. Tor input is allowed by related/established.

 I don't know the answer.  Maybe they
 developed for Android because there  are so
 many phones?  That reason alone doesn't mean it's a
 good idea.
 But doesn't it seem like
 using Android and trying to make it anonymous /  leakproof is starting with a huge
 disadvantage?
 If users
 really want anonymity, why start with Android (Google)?
 It seems like the same applies to using Gmail
 & complaining that it  doesn't work
 well with Tor Browser.  Why not use another provider - that
 *isn't* the world's most notorious,
 commercial privacy invader?
 Tor devs don't use Chrome in Tor Browser -
 for good reason.

Thus google store my IP address? How can I see "X-Originating-Header"?
Gmail tends to add a header containing your client IP - X-Originating-Header
I've never looked to see whether any spam filters are set up to use it
though. If they were to, they'd see the IP of an exit node so might mark as
spam based on that.

Google can't reveal client IP. It is an email header, Can you tell me the IP address of sender?

Send an email to another account you control (might work sending to
yourself, I've not tested).
Then in the receiving mail client choose "View original", "view headers"
or similar. It'll probably be one of the lowermost headers

@_author: Jason Long 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and forward email to Spam folder. 
It is my problem and if webmail use mail server IP then why my email forwarded to Spam!!!!!  So, it seems there are some differences which decide whether Google will include the client IP when using the web interface.
If you're using an "Apps for domain" account, the X-originating-ip header will be added every time, whether you use Webmail or the "Gmail" app on Android.
If you're using a  address then it's not so consistent. I've not tracked down exactly what the difference are, but it adds it some of the time. 
Doesn't seem to be purely related to logging in from a new IP, could perhaps be related to the "reputation" of the IP you're connecting from? IPv4 vs IPv6 doesn't make a difference as far as I can see. Presumably they only add it when they consider the connection is possibly a risk, otherwise you'd never add it (or always add it).
So the fuller answer, I guess, is "perhaps"
That's not strictly true. 
Under various circumstances, when using webmail, google will add an additional header - X-Originating-IP - which contains the IP of the client (i.e. your browser) connected to the webmail interface.
Once upon a time, Hotmail used to do it to, though they moved to using a hashed version (and X-EIP as the header IIRC).
You won't see the webmail client in "received from" headers though.
It depends how you send your email.
If you use their webmail, your client IP is not send, because first sending
SMTP machine is a gmail one :

        Received: by mail-it0-x229.google.com; Sun, 30 Oct 2016 04:43:55 -0700
If you use SMTP, your client IP is send because it’s the first sending SMTP
machine :

 Your own IP address is not changed by the Tor
 network.
 What the Tor network changes
 periodically is route taken to wesites you
 visit in Torbrowser.  Each route will use 2 or
 3 different IP addresses
 (the entry guard
 plus a middle node plus an exit node).
 The
 websites you visit do not know (and cannot find out) what
 your own
 IP address is, they can only see
 the exit node's IP address.
 If you want to visit websites and have them see
 your own IP address each
 time, use the
 normal browser that comes with your operating system.

 Hello.

 You can't ensure
 that none of the Tor nodes in a particular three-node
 circuit aren't run by some three-letter
 government agency.
 There
 are regular checks about expired versions of Tor, poorly
 configured Tor policies on nodes, or other
 explicit bad things, but
 those only catch
 the most obvious insecurities.
 You can run your own relay or bridge, which
 could at least ensure one
 hop isn't
 compromised, not to mention the benefit for the many other
 Tor
 users.
 But ultimately, Tor's topography mitigates
 against one of the three
 nodes in your
 circuit being compromised. If the first hop is
 compromised, then they only know who you are,
 but not where your
 destination is. If the
 last hop is compromised, they only know where
 you're going, but not who you are (unless
 your providing clear text of
 personally
 identifying information).
 This happens to be why that quiet individual
 who runs one bridge or
 relay is so vital to
 the integrity of the network.

 A challenge is that there are threat models in
 which a considerable number
 of Tor users may
 be exposed, at least for some of their circuits.
 * If a single adversary runs
 several fast nodes that are popular and whose
   relationship to each other is undisclosed, a
 pretty high amount of traffic
   may select
 that adversary's nodes as entry and exit nodes for the
 same
   circuit.  The guard node design
 gives a relatively low probability of this
   happening to any individual user with
 respect to any individual
   adversary in
 any specific time period, but doesn't guarantee that
 it
   would be a particularly rare event for
 Tor users as a whole.
 * If
 adversaries cooperate, they can get benefits equivalent to
 running many
   nodes even though each one
 only runs a few.
 * If an
 adversary can monitor network activity and see both entry
 and exit
   points, for a given circuit, it
 can perform correlations even though
   it
 doesn't operate any nodes.  Or, an adversary that can
 monitor some
   networks can increase its
 chance of getting visibility of both ends of
   a connection by also operating some nodes,
 since some users whose entry
   or exit
 activity the adversary otherwise wouldn't have been able
 to
   monitor from network surveillance
 alone may sometimes randomly choose to
 use that adversary's nodes in one of these positions.
 * An adversary that can
 monitor some kind of public or private online
   activity can perform coarse-grained timing
 correlation attacks between
   its own entry
 nodes (or parts of the Internet where it can see Tor
   node entry) and the online activity that it
 can see.  For example, if a
   user
 regularly uses Tor to participate in some kind of public
 forum,
   public chat, etc., the adversary
 could gather data about how entry
   traffic
 that it can see does or doesn't correlate with that
 participation.
   Or if an adversary can
 obtain logs about the use of a particular online
   service, even though those logs aren't
 available to the general public,
   it can
 also correlate that statistically with entry data that it
 has
   available for some other reason.
 The "good news" is
 that a given Tor user is probably not very likely to
 be vulnerable to many of these attacks from
 many adversaries when using
 Tor infrequently
 or for brief periods.  Yet many of these attacks would
 work at least some of the time against a pretty
 considerable amount of
 Tor traffic.
 I agree with your point that
 just having more random people run nodes
 helps decrease the probability of success of
 several of these attacks.

Yes but It is a little slow :(
  It means you successfully connected to Tor, using Orbot. Congratulations!
You are using one of the Meek Bridge servers, which has a lot of users, which is likely why you received the message about the overloaded node.
Is everything else working for you?

Hello Tor Team,
I read some articles about Tor security and some of them said that if the governments see your real IP address then they can't see
the Tor traffic or websites that visited by Tor and if they can sniff Tor traffic then they can't see your real IP.
Is it true?
How Tor team members are sure about it? If the governments use any special devices for sniffing Tor traffics then why
they should reveal it?
If a user use the Telegram messenger with Sock5(Tor) proxy, then is it secure?
Thank you.

To some extent, you can control to what extent personal information

Security is a process involving many steps (e.g. threat modelling), that

by compromised end-devices and by their habits.
Some governments are not that reluctant on expressing their ideas

 Alas, there are no great answers here.
Here's a related FAQ answer:
You could conceivably find an open proxy or a vpn and chain that at
the end of your circuit, but (a) it is messy (hard) to do that from a
practical perspective, and (b) it probably harms your anonymity.
The better answer is to find the people who run those websites, and
help teach them about the value of users who care about privacy:
But that suggestion will work better on some sites than others.

  Tor browser used to have this option to refresh the circuits but it seems to be removed in the current version as I cannot find it now (correct me if I am wrong).
If you are using Tor directly, you will need to use a controller to instruct Tor to form new circuits. Nyx seems to be the most popular option :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to configure Tor for use a built-in bridg 
Thank you, but the Tor is censored and with Tor-Browser and built-in bridge(obfs4) I can open Tor, but with Tor CLI I can't. It just has %45 progress.I copied the torrc from Tor-Browser into "/etc/tor" but not worked :(
Sent from Yahoo Mail on Android Run (as root):
# apt install obfs4proxy
Add the following lines to torrc:
UseBridges 1
ClientTransportPlugin obfs4 exec /usr/bin/obfs4proxy
Then, you need to add some further bridge lines. I recommend that you don't use the "built-in bridges" (they're only built into Tor Browser, not into Tor itself), as you need to add the bridges manually anyways. I recommend that you go to  and get yourself some bridge configuration lines.
Then, add your bridge lines to torrc, but add the string "Bridge " to the beginning to each of your lines.
So it looks like this:
Bridge obfs4 154.35.22.10:15937 8FB9F4319E89E5C6223052AA525A192AFBC85D55 cert=GGGS1TX4R81m3r0HBl79wKy1OtPPNR2CZUIrHjkRg65Vc2VR8fOyo64f9kmT1UAFG7j0HQ iat-mode=0

Socks 5 + DNS? Is it an option in Tor Browser or Telegram?
When I changed the Telegram proxy setting for use Tor, then I can send and receive messages.
First of all, make sure it is Socks 5 + DNS because you want your DNS requests
to be anonymous also.
Also, Tor is primarily an anonymity tool. If you have to log into Telegram
with a private phone number, then you're not going to be anonymous and so Tor
isn't going to be a big help to you. That is, unless you're using a burner
phone/sim that doesn't have your real name associated with it.
Secondly, will the Telegram servers accept messages from Tor exit nodes? You
might want to find out from others first before your spend money on it or get
into trouble with their service.

Tor is more than just an anonymity tool, it allows you to select what
others know about you and what you are doing. For example, even if you
agree to tell Telegram who you are, you might not want to tell them
where you are located and allow them to record an history of all your
travels. Maybe you also don't want your ISP to know that you are using
Telegram and allow them to record an history of when you have been using

@_subject: [tor-talk] Upcoming Tor security releases to fix a 
Please fix Orbot.
   Hello!
Some time this week, we currently plan to put out a set of security
updates for all supported versions of Tor.  These releases will fix a
pair of denial-of-service bugs: one that we are classifying at "low"
severity, and one that we are classifying at "high" severity.
Our recommendation will be for everybody, including relays and
clients, to upgrade once packages are available for their platforms.
Although these vulnerabilities are "only" denial-of-service issues,
any denial-of-service attack against Tor could be leveraged by an
attacker to aid in a traffic analysis attack.
To the best of our knowledge, these vulnerabilities are not being
exploited in the wild.
Currently supported release series are 0.3.5, 0.4.1, 0.4.2, and 0.4.3
(alpha).  If you have not yet upgraded to one of those, the time to do
so is soon.
For our policy and process for handing security issues, please see:
best wishes,
