Did you see the Tor Blog post Mission Impossible: Hardening Android for Security and Privacy?
Perhaps Mike Perry, or others who have tried it, can let us know how the project is progressing?  The last comment was posted back in August and the updated blog doesn't show when it was last updated. It would be nice if the changelog showed some dates.
And a related question, how does one tunnel UDP through TCP or Tor?
And all I wanted for Xmas was a Tor Tshirt... My relay node has made the 500KBs avg for two months and I was hoping I would have heard something about the Tshirt being on it's way... 423.44 kB/s avg for three months and by my simple calculation 333 kBs (500x3/2) should have averaged 500 kBs for two months, or am I being too numerate? Happy New Year!

How did you determine the resolution of all exits?  How many of the resolvers support DNSSEC?
$ host sigaint.org
sigaint.org has address 185.10.58.250
sigaint.org mail is handled by 5 mx2.sigaint.org.
sigaint.org mail is handled by 5 mx1.sigaint.org.
root at box:/etc/ssh# cat /etc/resolv.conf domain members.linode.com
search members.linode.com

$ host 185.53.179.29
Host 29.179.53.185.in-addr.arpa. not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
I would like to select DNS resolvers that support DNSSEC.  Can an end user (TBB perhaps) select a specific DNS resolver or a set of resolvers?

We can now look forward to Ubuntu Tor packages being kept up to date!  [1]
The exception was granted, [2] and some of the Ubuntu Tor packages have been updated. [3]
Without the work of many others, this small victory would not be possible.  A few I would like to mention:
Peter Palfrader for maintaining the Debian and TorProject Tor packages! Mark Shuttleworth and Roger Dingledine for their support in this effort!
Marc Deslauriers for his support and updating the Ubuntu packages!
1. 2. 3.

Ubuntu hasn't done a very good job of providing updates for Tor packages.
I'm attempting to do something about it by submitting a request for Tor packages "SRU (stable release update) micro version update exception" to the Ubuntu Technical Board.  If the exception is granted, Peter Palfrader's Tor packages from either Debian or TorProject.org could be used to fix any security issues.
