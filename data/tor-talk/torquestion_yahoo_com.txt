@_subject: tor trying to pop mail from random IPs on win32 
Is there a reason why tor would try and POP mail from random IPs while running in Windows?  I have a log from AVG Antivirus that shows tor is trying to POP mail.  The process number is tor's process id number at the time that it happens.  Also, I do not have any mail client installed on that machine that might be trying to POP mail
