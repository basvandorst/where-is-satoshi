Yeah. I've heared that relay mentioned several times before, but I've

If I connect to a Tor hidden service am I right in thinking it goes like:

If I then change routelen to '2' in circuitbuild.c as per  at freehaven.net/msg08747.html does that give me:

If you run as an exit node, it's my understanding that you also act as a
middleman node. Would it be possible, and would it be a good idea, to
add an option such that you only act as an exit node?
It seems a bit of a waste to use potential exit bandwidth as middleman
relaying bandwidth when exit bandwdith is more scarce.

By using Tor for that purpose, all you're doing is making it so people
running Exit Tor nodes can sniff your traffic, rather than people watching
the unsecured wireless network.
I wouldn't automatically assume that reduces your chance of having your
traffic sniffed. It might even increase the chance of that occuring.

I have several local machines behind NAT which I want to use Tor. Would
I get better performance by installing Tor on each of them, or by having
a single machine with Tor on and then pointing the web browsers on each
of them at the proxy on that box?
If I were to install Tor on each of them, would it be possible for an
observer to see that there are several copies of Tor running from
machines on the same IP? I'm guessing that it would be obvious because
of the increase in the number of directory requests?
If I were to install it on just one box and then point all the other
boxes at it, wouldn't I end up putting all the traffic through a
smaller number of circuits and thus having a slower network?

There's nothing in there that we didn't already know was possible, and I realise

Lots of people simply don't know how to use Tor safely.

commonly used services to go entirely over https? Eg any request for

That doesn't sound completely accurate to me. Specifically the sentence "Next,
privoxy sends an HTTP GET request, which contains no hostname, domainname,
Nickname.exit, nor IP address through the connection to the web server at the
other end."
If I'm proxying through Tor and I type this into my browser:
My browser asks the proxy for a connection to "
Once my browser receives the connection, it then sends this down it:
GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: The problem is that some web servers have multiple websites on the same IP
and they decide which website to serve by looking at the HTTP Host header.
So you need privoxy/polipo to strip the "example.exit" from the HTTP Host
header before forwarding on the actual HTTP request, so it sends this
GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n

I like this idea. Perhaps the various package maintainers could be
lobbied to update the installation scripts to request a valid

As well as logging, perhaps Tor should make an effort to send an
email to the local root account when it detects it is "too old".
Obviously, that wont work in many instances, eg Windows Tor servers,
but it would be an additional contact route...

@_subject: all traffic through a VPN on top of tor, done! 
If you're only concerned with hiding where you're connecting to from
your neighbour, you can modify the source code fairly easily to make two
hop circuits instead of three hop circuits (*). You could then limit the
ExitNodes to be fairly local (your own country), and then after a little
trial and error, manually pick a group of EntryNodes which are also in
your own country, and which perform well for you. High bandwidth
University nodes for example. One thing you absolutely don't want to do
is use a Hidden Service for your VPN as that doubles the number of hops
in the circuit.
(*) I can't remember how though. Google it.

@_subject: Reduce hops when privacy level allows to save Tor network bandwidth 
The following occured to me. Tor is designed to protect users from
traffic analysis by very technical adversaries. There are many use
cases where that level of protection isn't required. In those cases,
if there was a config option to reduce the number of hops in a circuit
to 2 (or possibly even 1), then users would be able to get themselves a
more responsive circuit, whilst saving the Tor network overall
In a three hop circuit, when x contacts y, the Tor network ends up
having to transfer 4X the data:
x -(1)> Entry -(2)> Middle -(3)> Exit -(4)> y
In a 2 hop circuit it only has to transfer 75% of that:
x -(1)> Entry -(2)> Exit -(3)> y

@_author: Erilenz 
@_subject: Reduce hops when privacy level allows to save Tor network 
All of that is wrong. You're assuming that Node1 transmitting to Node2
and Node2 receiving from Node1 are two separate streams. My "diagram"
has numbers where each transfer takes place. The first diagram has 4
transfers and the second diagram has 3 transfers.
People are going to use Tor even if they don't need strong anonymity
because it is free, and because it has certain desirable attributes
that other things such as VPNs don't give you. Given that they're
going to use Tor, why not minimise the amount of bandwidth they're
using in the process of doing so.

Yes, they should. However, just because people shouldn't be doing something

@_subject: Reduce hops when privacy level allows to save Tor network 
That's fine, as long as you're assuming that people only use Tor when they need
strong anonymity. As soon as you realise that people who don't need strong
anonymity are using it as well, your point fails. Whether or not they *should*
be doing so is irrelevant. The options are:
1.) Ignore that they're doing it
2.) Prevent them from doing it
3.) Make their impact smaller when they are doing it
I choose 3.
Again. Whether or not people *should* be using Tor under these circumstances is
irrelevant. The point is, they are, and how to deal with it.
I prefer the concept of combining safe defaults with more choice. If people
are afraid for their life, they're not going to reduce the number of hops
from 3 to 2.

That is the worse analogy I've ever seen. It's terribly constructed and
doesn't bare even the slightest resemblance to what is being discussed.
Please try again. Or don't.
No it's not. I've not done anything which would suggest I was trolling.
Random claims that somebody is trolling in order to discredit what they're
saying ... now *that's* trolling.
Are you suggesting that I said something about changing the default number
of hops? I explicitly stated the *opposite* of that. Your first language
is English right?
You keep talking as though it is *me* who wants this capability. For
myself, I want a 3 hop circuit, but I want more bandwidth available to
me. In order to get more bandwidth, I want those who *can* use a 2 hop
circuit to do so.
This is one of those ideal/practical arguments. Idealistically, Tor
would only have 3 hop circuits and those who want "simple circumvention"
wouldn't use it. That doesn't make it the practical truth of what is
happening though.
