I'm interested in mapping the adoption of Tor over the past couple of
years. One enduring challenge is that the available traffic statistics
( reportedly also include a huge spike in
use  around mid-2013, connected to a botnet routing through Tor.
If anyone might offer advice on getting more precise statistics, the
assistance is appreciated.

Thanks for the tips. I'm particularly interested in trying to correct for the botnet traffic; the hope is that I can get a reasonable idea of how much the userbase has grown over time. I'll snoop around in the archives as well.
