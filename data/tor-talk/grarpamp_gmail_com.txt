Forget about protocol. The socket()'s have been either
bind()'ed or connect()'ed. And thust they show up with
endpoints. That's what I'm referring to.
Was hoping for more discussion. Maybe I'll just open some
'bugs', now that the few things I noted are a bit narrower,
and leave them as placeholders. Wish there was a way to edit
the flyspray entries.

Hi :) Finished testing...
It is still necessary for Tor to have a -dnsclientaddress option.
If I point resolv.conf to 127.0.0.1, Tor binds as follows:
tor      tor      73613    9 udp4 127.0.0.1:2884 127.0.0.1:53
tor      tor      73552    9 udp4 127.0.0.1:2884 127.0.0.1:53
This is perfectly fine.
If I point resolv.conf to w.x.y.z on the internet Tor binds as
tor      tor      73613   10 udp4 10.0.0.1:2885   w.x.y.z:53
tor      tor      73552   10 udp4 10.0.0.1:2885   w.x.y.z:53
This is not desirable. Because as before, I'm trying to move all
of Tor's activities off of my primary interface address [10.0.0.1]
and onto the secondary [10.0.0.2]. I've been able to use the following
to move everything but this DNS binding to the secondary [10.0.0.2]:
-orlistenaddress 10.0.0.2
-dirlistenaddress 10.0.0.2
-address 10.0.0.2 <-- workaround for bug: Tor not making note
 internally of the above two options and failing to run.
-outboundbindaddress 10.0.0.2

To appear to the casual inspector to be a named. To get around those
filtering dns requests from ports other than 53. Named commonly
listens on 53. But it may also send from 53 if so configured.
Different environments have different rules.
Ahh, yes. Ok, Tor is not likely to be a named anytime soon :) I'll
fire up a named, bind it as desired and point Tor at it.
Hey, that just might be the source of those warning messages I first
posted in this thread. It may be 'guessing' wrong even though I
told it where to bind OR and DIR...ok, tested, that's the bug.
Updating ticket.
Address _address_
 The IP address or fqdn of this server (e.g. moria.mit.edu).
 You can leave this unset, and Tor will guess your IP address.

Not possible as of yet. But likely moot...
sockstat/netstat always shows tor as having a connection tacked up
to the DNS servers specified in resolv.conf. I wasn't seeing any
gethostby* calls as other applications do, so I poked around...
    2098 _evdns_nameserver_add_impl(u32 address, int port) {
    2117         ns->socket = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
    2131         if (connect(ns->socket, (struct sockaddr *) &sin,
So I stuck this right before 2131:
 printf("CONNECTevdns2131: %s\n", debug_ntoa(address));
and get:
 CONNECTevdns2131:  53
Looks to me like a standalone DNS client implementation, bypassing
the resolver, no? ... Then me, not being great with C, might suggest
replacing the:
socket [dgram] --> connect [remote]
 call order from the above with:
socket [dgram] --> bind [local] --> connect [remote]
That 'bind [local]' would honor a new -DNSClientAddress option.
And optionally a new -DNSClientPort option. And since the name
'resolv.conf' confusingly implies use of the normal system resolver
routines, some clarity regarding its actual usage could be added
to the docs.
I know about -DNSPort, -DNSListenAddress, that isn't part of the
above. Though -ServerDNS* are related to it.
Feel free to slap me with a wet fish if I'm being way off base and
clueless here :) But I'm wearing pretty strong deodorant now.

Yes. And it should have the facility to bind to whatever address I
tell it to use for that purpose. Not the primary address on any
given interface, the '*' address, etc. Tor already has facilities
for its OR and DIR 'listeners' and the 'outboundbindaddress'. It
needs one one for DNS resolution as well. I don't want it using .1
for that. Create a -dnssrcport and -dnsbindaddress. -dnssrcport
should allow >=1024 for non-root and anything for root, particularly
Note that Tor still performs some tor related DNS queries even if
it is: 'reject *:*'. Otherwise there would be no need to bind udp
in that case.
No. As with w.x.y.z:53, I have protected the innocent for this note.
In your mind, do the reverse and replace every instance of 10.0.0.0/24
above with one publicy routed /24 cidr block while preserving the
last octet. Then it is clear that something is wrong. I have bound
OR, DIR and the 'outboundbindaddress' to .2. It thinks otherwise.

Tor seems to rotate perfectly good circuits out of production on
more or less regular intervals. For any number of good reasons of
course. And it likewise aims to have a certain amount open all the
time. It would be handy to have controller settings to:
- halt/continue rotation
- set the number of open circuits
This would be particularly useful when debugging connection issues.

Hi. Thought that there might be those out there that may wish to
allot their middle node resources to specific types of traffic or
a combination thereof.
onion only - for supporting onionland
exit only - for supporting realworld
These two could be implemented with an advertised flag of some sort.
And they would use the currently existing bandwidth limiters.
onion/exit blend - for supporting both as desired
This would use two new limits that when combined add up to the
existing overall limits. Or maybe a priority based system if one
type would happen to not saturate the overall limits all the time.

Hi. I have various alias addressing on my interfaces. I mapped
everything to rfc1918 space for this note.
 inet 10.0.0.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.0.255
 inet 10.0.0.2 netmask 0xffffffff broadcast 10.0.0.2
I fire up a statically compiled tor in a chroot populated with the
minimum required to keep tor quiet:
I exec tor while already under a dedicated non-root user/group.
I use the following addressing options:
 -socksport   9050 -sockslistenaddress   127.0.0.1
 -controlport 9051 -controllistenaddress 127.0.0.1
 -orport  9001 -orlistenaddress  10.0.0.2
 -dirport 9030 -dirlistenaddress 10.0.0.2
Note that my packet filters have proper holes for Tor.
As you can see, the OR and DIR binds honor the requested use of the
secondary address. Yet the udp and outbound connections bind to the
primary address on the interface.
# before outboundbindaddress
tor      tor      55099    4 tcp4   10.0.0.2:9001   *:*
tor      tor      55099    5 tcp4   10.0.0.2:9030   *:*
tor      tor      55099    6 tcp4   127.0.0.1:9050  *:*
tor      tor      55099    7 tcp4   127.0.0.1:9051  *:*
tor      tor      55099    8 tcp4   10.0.0.1:1854   86.59.21.38:443
tor      tor      55099   12 tcp4   10.0.0.1:1856   128.31.0.34:9001
tor      tor      55099    9 udp4   10.0.0.1:3093   w.x.y.z:53
tor      tor      55099   11 stream tor[55103]:12
tor      tor      55103    9 udp4   10.0.0.1:3093   w.x.y.z:53
tor      tor      55103   12 stream tor[55099]:11
So I added this to the config:
 -outboundbindaddress 10.0.0.2
Now you can see that this was indeed honored as well. And we are
now left with only the udp binds to deal with. However, I can see
no configuration option to do that.
So that is missing feature # after outboundbindaddress
tor      tor      82854    4 tcp4   10.0.0.2:9001   *:*
tor      tor      82854    5 tcp4   10.0.0.2:9030   *:*

tor      tor      82854    8 tcp4   10.0.0.2:2601   86.59.21.38:443
tor      tor      82854   12 tcp4   10.0.0.2:3605   91.143.80.22:9001
tor      tor      82854    9 udp4   10.0.0.1:2228   w.x.y.z:53
tor      tor      82854   11 stream tor[82856]:12
tor      tor      82856    9 udp4   10.0.0.1:2228   w.x.y.z:53
tor      tor      82856   12 stream tor[82854]:11

to be confused regarding its socket allocation as noted below.

False. ISP's in the US don't have to record any information of any
kind about their user or their data whatsoever. None, period. Nor are
they required to give it to anyone except under legal process
[subpoena, court order].
US ISP's routinely lobby against recording anything because the time,
capital and
recurring cost to them to do so is precisely that, pure cost, no profit.
Any information they record is usually related to generating metrics
so that they can make more money.
However, lately, all that has been flipping on it's back, now many are
recording as a feel good or pressure measure, 'Hey, I'm a spiffy
"patriotic" company, I helped law enforcement bust a terrorist 9yo kid
today. Yay :) Please count me in as a good guy and don't put me on
your watch list ok.'
Any data they do happen to have on hand is of course subject to process.
True. There is also the CALEA system, the result of which is that
pretty much every phone switch in the US is remotely tappable.
Internet gear is the next obviously logical step for that joint,
partly required, partly offered, effort.
True. Including other acts... wiretap, fcra, blah and etc. Such acts
in some cases require those that have data about you to disclose it
back to you on request. Or to others at your explicit direction. But
that's usually only in the finance and medical sectors.
Only if such 'requirement' means court order. They can give it to whoever they
want, provided they don't care about the possible legal repurcussions
of doing so. ie: AT&T etc obviously have a 69 position with the gov't
going back to the days of Western Union, so they don't care.
The ISP only knows that the user is using Tor.
And as always, it is best to assume your adversary knows far more than
you think... and to plan your strategies accordingly.

Is it not safe to assume that the so called 'slowness' of Tor has

Other than somehow making the directory authorities self roaming and healing
autonomous beings within the Tornet to eliminate some quasi SPOF's...
 Is there any reason to still have/maintain that old blurb about, in general,
 "Tor's not ready, don't advertise it yet".
One's odds of finding a fast path could go up with more [idle] users. Or at
least remain the same.
Maybe this is a general request for a 'mark current' on that quote
page [wherever it is these days], backed therein with some roadmap
in this overall context.
I used to work with filled pipes. Everyone wanted to play whack a
mole with the users. Sure, we got some good wins with knocking out
ports and other known tactical stuff. But in the end we couldn't
see to crunch the rest and ended up ordering more bandwidth so our
curves looked less like a flattop haircut.
Dunno, always figured it could be advertised and still disclaimed
as to security or whatever if it would increase the available BW
or drop the transactional delay without hitting scale limits.
With some sharing sites going under, new global DMCA treaty summits

No. You want the actual strings in use by real systems as above. Not

All fixed in FF 3.5.6.
I won't suggest anything. But there should be a browser that is
well developed/maintained and usable by the populous
that puts security first. Now 'populous' may prevent that but
surely finance/health/etc corporations might want a more
secure browser for internal deployment. OpenBSD and even
FreeBSD have fit that niche and balance fairly well.
Sandboxing and well configured setups are always a good thing.
Tor's sole purpose is to prevent the real source of TCP packets
from being discovered. And to provide similarly hidden services.
Everything you are able to put through Tor is 'safe' in respect
to the purpose of Tor. Outside of what Tor offers, it is up to the
user to figure out and know how to manage their own security practices.
All apps have and will have flaws. If you don't trust FF/them to:
- Punt everything through Tor... sandbox them.
- Resist attacks that would give access to your system... don't put
sensitive stuff on that system.
- Resist attacks that would disclose browser state, steal sessions,
etc... use single purpose sessions.
Layer your security so you don't have that problem. If you can't run
FF with java/js/flash/images all enabled and feel safe about it,
you're not doing it right.
FF is the current defacto mass market browser, outside of IE and Mac.
Tor is best served by focusing on enhancements/bundles for that.

are getting out and actually talking with each other!
Briefly reading their docs. Looks like another brokered system.
Problem is the PM's and NM's are run by the same third party.  That
party has all the data needed to de-anon you at the request of the
site or other entities. Even if the roles are split across parties
it is still much weaker than Tor. And they quote:
"Nymble's main goal is to protect users' privacy with respect to
the servers they connect to: Client's IP addresses are anonymous to servers.
Clients must trust Nymble to provide this anonymity against servers."
Further, it can't deal with multiple users behind say, corporate,
university and cafe nats. And it DHCP environments could be a mixed
bag of time delays after getting stuck with the jerks old ip address.
It still has a place though, but hopefully not an exclusive one.
The time forgiveness is nice.
If this refers to Craigslist, it seems that yes, sometimes it will
throw up an automated blocked-392242xxx at craigslist message upon
viweing.  As for posting, they tend to silently sink posts somewhere
in the positng process before it actually makes it into the listings.
My testing seems to say that some large fraction of the exit nodes
are blocked in this silent fashion.
I think Craigslist is in dire need of systems programming help and
a good bit of creativity. Their flagging system can be leveraged
much more effectively. And they can definitely reap some good wins
with throwing both their posts and inbound mail through the equivalent
of DSPAM. And they do really stupid stuff like putting the email
links in the personals section behind captchas but leave the rest
of their site links open. I'd leave it all open and DSPAMify it.
With all the spam posts they have, there's actually benefit in
allowing geeks to automate their LTR searches and replies :)
In Canada, plentyoffish seems to block new account creation via
tor. Usage works ok, unless you roam outside minimally the USA,
then you get auto nuked.
Google also blocks new accunt creation. Honestly, I don't have much
faith in google anymore. With all their brainpower they really have
no excuse for throwing up SMS as a way to combat their publicly
stated primary reason for doing so in their FAQ's... spam prevention.
Facebook seems ok.
Hate Ebay so can't comment.
Don't know much about identi or LJ.
Though agreed, absent statements from them all as to what they're
doing to combat and assist behind the scenes, it could be just the
Tor IP's being unlucky in the game of permanent whack a mole. As
opposed to targeting Tor specifically. I'll give that maybe 50/50
Absolutely agreed. I've read dozens of corporate privacy policies
end to end and they all have a numerous cop outs in them that give
me no reason to trust them. Particularly in regards to 'those third
parties which provide services to them so they can serve you'
The more restrictive/closed about how their services are used and
their internal policies and practices, the less kudos they earn.
I would not be suprised at all if there are third party shells
backed by very large black orgs whose purpose is to vacuum up,
correlate, and rebroker the social data space... based entirely on
similar cop outs or plain old under the table dealings. Blacker
versions of Intelius, Axciom, Google and the credit bureaus come
to mind.
Happy socializing, suckers ;)
Local linux/bsd/win/mac/2600/cissp/infragard/etc user groups also
come to mind as both source and sink for Tor related outreach.

It's much easier for old school non web 2.0 people to use mbox or
maildir text versions.. load the whole thing up in mutt or whatever.
The main benefit is being able to search using search tools you
know work for you across all your mail. Mutt, subject, sender,
regex, perl, etc. Hitting reply actually works :) Online web stuff
is meant for kids and a real pain at that, and if search is provided,
it's pretty limited.
As to boldly going where few have gone before...
The FreeBSD project has it's entire mail archives available... about
16 years and gigs worth, raw as delivered... via ftp and cvsup.
It's fantastic. No worries about dropped mail or bouncing oneself
off the list due to your mail provider failing to have a clue. With
some scripts, it's great for historical search and daily use. And
it integrates into well designed mirroring/distribution pretty
Also interesting: markmail.org
I might suggest something like that. Split mbox by month, gzip prior
months, current month as a raw live mbox. Rsync will do its efficient
append mode thing on it for mirroring, etc.
As to spam...
There's really no point in attempting to hide addresses/headers in
this fashion. Just as how marc, gmane, etc subscribe to lists, so
do spammers. They're not dumb, they know subscribing yields a
goldmine.  People's machines get hacked and any 'private' contact
list gets sent out to botnets. Or they import you into social network
sites.  The only place spamfighting makes sense these days is at
the mta layer and post mta off in userland somewhere.

So long as their browser is set to proxy, I'm not seeing a breach?
Just the issues with website interaction covered by Drake.
I quit it, preferring mapaddress, because it didn't work with https.
I think he means optioning out the http[s]://..exit you paste in

which is a great tool to have.
Though if I'm just hacking about, I'll tack the .exit on as needed.
Then you've got cases where .exit and .exit
are handy too.
Optioning it off wouldn't be a big deal. Mostly because users would view
the website issues as unexpected. And documenting all the caveats

Related to the blox* thread.
When 0.2.0.3x was marked stable, I went through and
mailed all the contacts running old versions. Some
profusly thanked, some silently updated, some ignored.
It would be handy if...
Upon marking and releasing a new stable branch, include
in the release notes what the minimum recommended versions
are and why [security breach, crashing, performance, needing
to break backward compat going forward, etc]... only
the really major reasons, just a few quotable lines. Some people
were like, why bother?
Make the contact field more of an encouraged option to use.
Maybe only a third of nodes had valid addresses.
Make Tor emit a logline hourly or at least daily when it notices
that it is old. Much more likely to stick out like that. Perhaps
graduate the verbosity/capitalization if it detects itself is not
in the current stable branch or older.
The torrc sample conf, man page, etc should mention the existance
of or-talk at the top of the relay configuration sections as something
operators should consider joining.
Consider an or-operator list should operator specific volume here
ever get high.
As an aside, I never bothered to inquire of anyone why their node
was so old. Those that offered it were:
- get around to it
- binary package/source deps/issues with their platform, user error
- bizarre security/performance rationalizations

Even one of these (or a cached-descriptors) from before the

find a good pre jump candidate by size. The 19th seems to

So sure, just one from the 17th might be good.

It's a way for operators to potentially run an exit to mail services where
sufficient exits immune to complaints might not otherwise exist.
Certainly others have thought it before.
Normal plaintext and encrypted messages should make it through a
good filter. For which spammers would be the ones to notice.
Granted, there are 13 supposedly unfiltered to at least one gmail IP
at the moment so the need to run one seems low.
How many (possibly christian?) exits filter porn? And who's noticing it?
Why just the other day google search was working but an exit mogrified
my favorite underage gay gerbil bdsm pic site. It showed me happy mice
in a cage, not gerbils. I was so pissed, I almost reported it :)
And I commonly see exits in the UAE bruteblocking sites that offend
their religious ideas. Not necessarily the exits doing it, but their
upstream ISP. Them blocking a metaforum with an IT jobs subsection
is annoying for sure, I just hit newnym. Should the community hunt
and flag these exits? Same difference.
And of course, if people were using ssl/tls with fingerprint checking,
they'd know their smtp session almost went to someone else's spool.
Or know their mail went through for sure. Surely everyones
client/server is doing their due diligence on that end :)
Never assume an exit operates in any given way.

@_subject: eliminating bogus port 43 exits 
While node operators are certainly welcome to characterize and
define both traffic and policy as deemed fit for their own purposes...
I might suggest that node operators examine things more fully in
order to make better policy decisions overall.
1 - The use of any given TCP port alone is not sufficient to qualify
traffic on it as "illegitimate, bogus, undeserving, invalid, scanner,
junk, etc". For all anyone knows, such traffic could be saving the
world, over ports otherwise unavailable to the client, EXACTLY as
per one of Tor's very legitimate use cases.
2 - Impact can be defined as number of connections over time and/or
bandwidth used. The operator would be well served by deploying and
using netflow analysis to better understand their exit's traffic.
2a - Tor itself should be intrumented with stats about attempted
circuit construction that fails due to exit policy.
3 - Further, there needs to be an understanding of what the traffic
ACTUALLY IS. Operators should be using tools such as wireshark,
tcpdump, bro, etc to determine the content. And if it turns out to
be encrypted to destinations and services unknown, NO such determination
can be made. The only thing left to go on is impact as in  above.
4 - /etc/services is defunct law and means very little these days.
App developers don't write to it, they just include a -p knob and a seemingly unused default. Clients use that -p knob to
avoid app conflicts, fix bum network policy, or simply to find a
hole that works for their perfectly legitimate uses, such as VPN's.
5 - There are many more whois servers than those listed, particularly
referral/delegated whois servers. The list is in permanent flux.
6 - Clients may have chosen certain exits to '[ab]use' for certain
ports, destinations, or activities, skewing the results for any
single exit or set of exits.
7 - It is well established practice at ISP's, corporations,
institutions, etc... that network admins may observe content in
order to determine policy direction, protect their network, and in
general, figure out what's up. Disclosing that content and/or acting
specifically on, or against, users, when the traffic was not collected
for that purpose, is entirely different and governed by strict laws,
at least in the US. Tor is no different than being a mini ISP, do
as any ISP would.
Bottom line, one must either:
1 - Take the corporate, block all but known stance. Hopefully know
 that people will still jam their unknowns through your knowns.
2 - Block/allow based on reasonably thorough analysis of content,
risk, load, etc.
3 - Block on whim, gut feel, religion, sunspots, etc.
4 - Allow all.
Unfortunately,  is usually the last to be chosen because it requires
the largest investment in time, knowledge, etc.
And lastly, as food for Tor development thought... there is no
interaction between Tor and kernel level packet filters. Most network
admins use such packet filters as their primary point of wizardry.
Tor could be enhanced with a mode of operation that interfaces in
real time with such filters to determine when to create circuits.

@_subject: eliminating bogus port 43 exits 
Being familiar with ISP practice in this area, it is why you examine
the content and what you do with the knowledge of the content
observed, be it stored in your head or on disk, that matters.
It's pretty well established that one may monitor traffic in a
general way in order to figure out what's up, make and enforce
policy and so on.
One cannot monitor/record a particular users's traffic and then
disclose that traffic or use it for/against them or oneself.
A few examples. Think about what is or is not legal and why.
1a - Any content based IDS such as bro.
1b - Any content based traffic shapers, balancers, etc.
1c - Any mail virus scanner, NetNanny, etc.
1d - Nagios, OpenNMS, netflow, HPOpenview, and so on.
You can sure bet the purveyors of these products do not develop
these systems in a pristine air gap lab environment using only
traffic they generated. And they are deployed on real data.
2 - Any ISP trying to figure out why their traffic just trended up
by 50% the last month. Any LAN admin trying to figure out why
their T1 is saturated.
3a - Any network research group, whether private, institutional or
white/gray/black. Bugtraq/FullDisclosure, Defcon presentations,
live demos, etc.
3b - That guy who snooped Tor and published embassy passwords.
4a - Employer x, checking up on adherance to corporate email policy,
reading random mails in the process.
4b - Finding out that you enjoy watching the mating habits of penuins
on PBS and then wondering why you have one or more fewer friends
in the lunchroom at work the next day.
5a - Social networking sites selling 'demographic and statistical'
data to places like Intelius.
5b - Google trolling your email to display targeted ads and do who
knows what else with.
5c - This call may be monitored or recorded.
These are all black areas that are hard to get internal facts about
unless you work deep inside where it happens. Some is ok, some is
untrustworthy, some is evil.
6 - The US govt itself, and other countries, with their tap the
entire internet projects. Some of this, and the handling of product
from it, is known to be illegal, it's just so black that no one has
been able to prove it yet.
7 - The thousands of networked entities that use netflow and other
statistical and content analysis tools 24x7x365 without concern.
8 - Public records requests for netflow data from public institutions.
Yes, they have had to disclose them.
It's safe to snoop port 43 for this purpose and say I found:
200 whois queries to known public servers x, y and z.
53 HTTP GET's
34 plaintext irc sessions to these public ircnets.
22 initial ssh fingerprints
16 encrypted sessions to somewhere inside the pentagon.

passwords over port 80 to the registrar, here's the tokens.
53 HTTP GET's to a hapless bank x, here's Tony's info
34 irc sessions of Linda and Mark cybering, check out this conversation.
38 encrypted sessions where I further MITM'd them and here's their
For the most part, in the US, an exit node operator is an ISP. They
are subject to common carrier, DMCA, ECPA and so on as it applies
to their role as an ISP. And ISP's also have the right to protect,
monitor, price and modify their nets as is standard industry practice.
And to shield themselves from potential liability or legal expenditure
and entanglement by dropping traffic that is too risky to handle, so
long as it's done agnostically.
If I were running an exit in the US, I'd be VERY happy to distill
any amount of stats, be it IP or content based, and post them here.
Including the number of times I saw the phrase 'I eat boogers' on
my wire. It's just stats.
And heck no, I'd never save or post the raw content, that's nuts.

One person's legit is another's bogus. It's always been that way.
Other than routing, the use of the internet is partly chaos and
it's not changing any time soon. "Packets found on an internet",
they exist, therefore they are, deal with it. So let's forget about
this port number legitimacy thing.
Further, some of us are real world network operators. We routinely
sniff and record traffic as part of our jobs. In fact, if we did
not, we would be very ineffective in our positions. Sniff if you
want, don't if you don't. So we can also throw this argument out
the window as to each their own.
What we really want to know as network operators is what exactly
IS going on in this case. And a simple count of SYN's is not enough
for some operators to make a decision regarding their rulesets.
Because for all they know, that traffic may indeed be diplomatic
communications with the Borg that are keeping our planet from being
assimilated. And well, unless you're Borg, or wish to become one,
that's pretty legitimate :)
Sniff that thing out, bring the full stats, write a whitepaper.
Operators will look at it and make their own choices.
Storing/grokking a days worth of tcp/43 sessions to find what percent
of them have whois strings should be easy. As should tallying up
the top ten whois queries and a distribution curve. That could help
determine if it's some clients gone haywire or normal. Though
somewhat like a ping someone left running, over Tor you'd just have
to wait it out. Classifying and counting the non whois sessions
would be harder but definitely interesting.
If I was running an exit I would have already done and posted this
for you all, but I'm not at the moment, so I can't. I yield the

Would provide a set of exits to try to use for whatever matches the

the traffic, but if it goes down, don't switch because that would
look like 'traveling' which would be bad. Unless the user could be

TrackHostExits  [rulenum]
TrackHostExitsTogether <0|1> [rulenum]
0 - each list item tracks its exit independantly, the current default
1 - all list items follow the same, autochosen, exit
The [rulenum] allows multiple statements to be configured. For when
the Together option = 1, and you want independant threads tracking
each list, to possibly different autochosen exits. Oops, more
TrackHostsExitTogether TrackHostsExitTogether And ok, so, new...
TrackHostsExit  Track and tie the entire list to an exit. Probably not as dynamic
[control interface] or capable as the general MapAddress
proposal/interface, but serves the same purpose as it. Perhaps as
a simpler rc config interface.
It took me a fair bit of time to find and figure out MapAddress.
Now that I know it, it is invaluable. I was asleep and left out
some important use cases, likely much more common than blocking...
Sites that pick language and featuresets depending on their idea
of your geolocation. Sites that refuse to create accounts, or delete
preexisting valid accounts, if the user 'travels'. Ebay is one such
site that dislikes travelers.
Placing these gotcha cases in the torfaq, etc, would help users be
aware of them and introduce the .exit workaround... as in my and hopefully in this new feature.
I put this to the or-talk for the users there in case they run into
Users could pick a relay by country from perhaps one of the torstatus
pages and then say:
MapAddress *.google.com=*.google.com..exit
I think there was discussion around letting operators denote their
country in their descriptors. So vidalia and the like may one day
filter and display those, with or without regard to the geoip db.
Had something to do with selecting countries, dunno.

Yep, it's just an on the radar thing.
I think the Tor project may indeed have some long term

I saw some graphs once.
There's probably a roadmap somewhere that gives an
idea of when Tor would be felt ready for more general
mass consumption/advertisment.
In bulk, in short order, yes, perhaps. Though if I
were a serious adversary I would probably advise
against something as we've just seen. I suggested
doing the analysis because often the first rollout
of anything is botched in some fashion. And there's
limited time to catch it, then learning occurs and
the future ones appear normal.

@_subject: Proposal: MapAddress wilcards [*] 
Many sites these days have multiple hosts in their domains. These
sites may have various administrative, logging or restrictive
policies. The same goes for the path to them if the user is unfortunate
enough to reside in strange lands.
As pure example, note myspace. They have myspace.com, full of
subdomains and hosts. There is also myspacecdn.com and a couple
others. They all work together to deliver the full content, images,
etc. This is common for load balancing, service segmentation and
so on.
(A) Tor makes the use of MapAddress with sites that use multiple
hosts like these difficult and insufficient because:
1 - Each host requires another MapAddress statement.
2 - It is impossible to know all the hosts the site uses beforehand.
3 - The sites commonly change hosts on a whim.
And missing the mapping due to this could affect either the user
or the site in unintended ways. Mapping should be a bit smarter and
able to do the right thing.
(B) So the following feature is proposed. Allow wildcards in the
MapAddress function such that:
1 - MapAddress google.com=google.com..exit
 Is now, and should remain, single host specific as usual.
2 - MapAddress *.google.com=*.google.com..exit
 Matches any third level domain such as  but obviously
 not google.com itself, as that is handled by (1) above. The name
 must have three levels to match.
3 - MapAddress **.google.com=**.google.com..exit
 Matches any third or deeper level domain such as a.b.c.d.google.com.
 This is a sensible hack. It is meant to allow future expansion of
 MapAddress to use some form of regex. Since '**' isn't really used
 in regexes, it is a useful glob for this purpose of allowing
 everything to match... which the user would _really_ want to have
 happen easily, without resorting to the obvious further nonsense
 in (4), which would be subject to the same problems in (A) above.
4 - MapAddress *.*.google.com=*.*.google.com..exit
 Matches any third and fourth domain. Only four level names would
 match. This is a NON-proposal.
5 - *google.com
 This is also a NON-proposal. It is too far down the path of some
 form of regex for the quick fix this proposal is meant to be. And
 it would obviously match all sorts of undesirables. The dots are
 important in DNS.
Note that having globs on the right side of the '=' doesn't make
sense from a routing point of view, but it's not supposed to. It
is done so that scripts can continue to keep track and do things
 # add map
 dst=$src.$exit.exit
 printf "authenticate \"foo\"\r\nmapaddress $src=$dst\r\nquit\r\n" |
 # remove map
 dst=$src
 printf "authenticate \"foo\"\r\nmapaddress $src=$dst\r\nquit\r\n" |
And of course the below command should list the mappings as usual.
Both the static mapping that was entered, and the dynamic ones that
result from it...
getinfo address-mappings/all
google.com google.com..exit NEVER
**.google.com **.google.com..exit NEVER
google.com..exit ..exit "2009-06-05 18:01:20"
mail.google.com..exit ..exit "2009-06-05 18:01:22"
a.b.google.com..exit ..exit "2009-06-05 18:01:24"
At this time, it is unimportant which rule the dynamic entry resulted
from as that is not denoted in the current versions of Tor. A simple
numeric tag in the first column of every rule would suffice for
that in the future.
I think adding this feature would easy for a coder to do and have
a good benefit. And perhaps even minimal enough to be included in
the soon to be stable 0.2.1.x train. Thanks :)

@_subject: Proposal: MapAddress wilcards [*] 
This proposal regarding domain name mapping is still alive and
maybe made it into a developer queue somewhere :)
However I forgot to add the IP address version of it. This is very
rough... wanted to get it out there for comment as time is short
to do much with it atm.
It is known that both fqdn's and ip's are commonly published,
embedded and otherwise used for various purposes on the internet
at large. Therefore:
Mapaddress should also be able to map any destination IPv4 or IPv6
address in CIDR notation through any particular exit. The CIDR
notation is what's new and provides the wildcard function. Example:
# catch just one address, route it through this exit
MAPADDRESS 1.2.3.4/32 1.2.3.4/32..exit
# map a range of addresses
MAPADDRESS 10.0.0.0/22 10.0.0.0/22..exit
# map all traffic
MAPADDRESS 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0..exit
Other interesting variations may be possible or useful:
# one to one by name, name could be wildcarded
MAPADDRESS foo.com 1.2.3.4/32..exit
# many to one name/ip
MAPADDRESS 10.0.0.0/22 foo.com..exit
MAPADDRESS 10.0.0.0/22 1.2.3.4/32..exit
# address translation
MAPADDRESS 2.3.4.5/20 7.8.9.0/20..exit
There should be a control flag somewhere that says socks requests
for fqdn's that are resolved to ip addresses should then be final
checked against the CIDR maps. Default = 1.
# MapFqdnCidr = 0
foo.com -> socks -> tor_resolve [ip1] -> exit -> internet [ip1]
# MapFqdnCidr = 1
foo.com -> socks -> tor_resolve [ip1] -> tor_map [ip2] -> exit -> internet [ip2]
There could also be something where tor will auto-create a matching
one to one host map like 1.2.3.4/32 1.2.3.4/32..exit.
foo.com maps to an ip, so might as well also map whatever that
resolves to to the same exit. I think it already does this to some
extent but would catch the cases where say, a webserver admin coded
both the fqdn and ip in html page. Could get funky if multiple A
records come back. And could be covered by 0/0 ip and *. fqdn maps,
so a non priority.
Just thinking... thanks!

I'd also say no real advantage to it.
Because the CPU in network gear is often much
less powerful than any random pc at 1/100th the price.
CPU's in routers, lets take Juniper because it's obvious
what their CPU is, pretty much do one thing, crunch BGP
tables and punt the result to silicon. They also may have to
process the first packet of various flows or deal with
protocols that haven't yet been burnt to wafers. But not much
else if the silicon is sufficiently advanced. Even if the
network facing ports dealt with the crypto bits in hardware,
the CPU side doesn't seem to be a winner for the rest of
the daemon.
Besides, no real carrier would EVER run Tor on their kilobuck line
of business router. Even if the Junos BSD shell let's you do it, wink ;-)
The advantage would more likely come from the 'just
because we can' run it on random available hardware
effect. And maybe from the set it and forget it uptimes
that router gear has.
Best market for such porting efforts might be the millions
of home linksys gateway type thingies out there that run
some sort of linux under the hood.

it through some number of nodes, or if it has

I've fielded questions regarding using the public Tor for bulk data

proves hard for me to resolve the impact in order to say go one way or
the other.
If they make a private Tor network, growth will be very slow because
there are not enough nodes to ensure anonymity. If they use public
Tor, it might get hammered. And it seems the long term survival of
using either pub/priv for this depend on whether users both felt anon
enough to give bandwidth and have enough bandwidth and the ethic to
give it. If they do, the math works out ok. If not, the net tanks.
And then there is the problem of authority servers.
It would be nice if Tor had an automated election system where that
function would roam about inside the Tor network itself as a self
sustaining agent. Because right now, I think one could cut them off
the net and take Tor with it.

Nor would using them in this way seem to be smart if these paths
through your nodes are more likely to be monitored than the rest of

[6/12/18/24/etc]. to turn up everything they can as non-exit / exit
relays and feed them all the bandwith they can muster... to see where

@_subject: Random chaff [was: more work for Grobbages] 
I was thinking solely of taps capable of observing user1, user2...
If user1 injects 1.21 MB of data on one side, and 1.21 MB of data
pops out the other side at injection time + network delay, the users
are made. Regardless of whether the observer can see inside the
network/crypto or operate in the network. And especially if the net
or users are quiet at that time.
But if there's chaff present, chaff that is only known to be chaff
by the network, or minimally by the recipient and generator, then
the game becomes harder. User1 and user2's pipes are always
independantly full of cap = ( chaff + wheat). Chaff is requested
from the network by the user's node to fill the cap during idle
times. The cap could be optional random dynamic, perhaps shrink
after some time of no wheat nearing the cap so as to not be needless
Users's nodes make [close?] peers just for traffic generation.
Tagged and controlled out of band. Involve the client's knowledge
that its socks or hidden service ports are generating n kbit/sec
of wheat.
Middle node link traffic could be similarly managed, albeit without
socks/hs knowledge, just bandwidth.
Any intelligent cell based clocking or committed rate management
within seem very hard when riding on the public internet. So it
would just be shoving bits into a hungry mouth until a gag message
comes back.
Maybe the problem with this idea is that the chaff generation system
might not be able to react fast enough when the real wheat travels
the pipes. So a 1.21 MB injection might still create some sort of
observable ripple at start and end times. The only way it might not
is if the pipes are oversubscribed _and_ packet lossy by design,
not just having the usual TCP congestion managed slowness. But that
would be terrible bad for most user facing applications and stacks.
Maybe it is the ripples that need hidden or randomized instead of
just filling pipes.
It seems safe to presume that near global passive adversaries exist.
And certainly ones cabaple of covering various regions. And that
offline processing of the mesh of flow information from them is
probably within current capabilities. I'm actually amazed we're not
seeing canaries kicking off all over the place. Particularly ones
involving exits.
The advice to run a relay while using the client seems sound due
to whatever free chaff it brings. Who knows.

If they are out for blood and suspect the user, the user should expect contact.
If they are making low level inquiries of interest, or just learning
about Tor, maybe not.
If they consider the case exigent, they will break down doors and
commandeer the place.
If not, they serve a warrant or other normal process to whoever
staffs/runs the place.
Industry standard... whois to phone/address/email to help desk to user.
A big DC will have all sorts of hierarchy until finally reaching the end user.
Contact will make it as far as either the LEA wants or the DC/ISP wishes
to disclose. Not all help desks will contact you for everything, as may be
the case when they feel like telling the inquirer to go away because
their request may violate either their corp policy or the law. Unless
you're procuring services anonymously, it may be good to chat
with everyone in your upstream just to get a feel for everything and
to make any needed arrangements.
Carding, cracking, death threats, piracy, all the usual things and more.
Seems pretty obvious. Tor just makes it interesting because it's
simply a newfangled carrier that can be used for good or bad. No different
than if you were to set up asterisk with a [t/e]-1 and call yourself a
phone company. That's where the raid/arrest risk lies... not enough
LEA's have
experience dealing with anon nets. To them, they just see activity from
an IP and assume end user / account holder. And rightly/technically so
as it could be one of many uses on that IP. The best you can hope for
is to clearly demarcate, notate, advertise and communicate that said
box is a standalone node and exists for all the good reasons Tor exists.
A node in a DC gives better isolation from your life and some time delay than
a node at home would. It also costs money. Each operator to their own.

Exactly. Everyone on the net seriously needs to be turning
on oppurtunistic encryption for all services. Crypto has little
cpu cost these days compared to the gain in privacy.
The last bit would be to store the data encrypted. That's easy
at the provider spindles, but breaks down if you want to provide your
own key for it. So you're left with OpenPGP, FUSE, etc.
Anyhow, whoever was going to put a table of providers
up on the wiki with little columns for https, imaps, pop3s, smtps,

I've worked in large internet orgs. We would get 'preservation

to honor requests, and there was no subpoena/order delivered as
part of the request. It was basically LEO's, websites and users
mailing/calling and saying, hey, what do you have for this date/IP,
hang on to it for us till we get something formal sent your way.
Management felt they had to play along before receiving that and
would tell the admins to go fetch. Thankfully data wasn't released
without order...  other places did release it.
If you're in a corp or edu with spare bandwidth, you really are in
a great position to operate under that entity 'shield'. Especially
if your mission is research, networking, outreach and such and the
node plays into the other things the org does.

Even if any particular anon system was comprimiseable, why would
any comprimising organization [save the full disclosure types] wish
to play their trump card in public??? If any anon system is comprimisable,
far better to listen in, under the convenient seal of black ops, until such a
time as enough has been learned to effect an 'indictment' upon much more
common fare, grounds and methods.
The users of anon systems would always be better off assuming that
they are indeed 'made' when calculating their exposure to certain riskes.
And further, they should integrate defenses to those riskes into their
usual mode of operations... rather than trust any given system blindly.
Yes, it is good to watch the news and public records in detail. As sure,
all trump cards are eventually played on table... the only question
is when, and for how long they've been held.
And given the subject of calculating riskes... any particular strong anon
system is likely good enough for all purposes not invoving a position in
which the direct target of such purpose is the same as one which is in a
position to prosecute: ie: government.
If you have ever talked to anyone related to the governent, you would
know this is the case as they are hesitant to even mention the most
mundane of obvious 'secret operational methods' used to go after, say,
the most common of street whores or drug dealers. Does one not think
that the grand high holy of holies between thy legs would be far more
protected from disclosure than that?

Nothing in the open source field can do so yet afaik.
To do it, a shim needs to be coded and placed between the application and Tor.
user <-> browser <-> [optional tool] <-> shim <-> tor:9050
The shim needs to listen on a proxy port (and or two configurable
ports (for http and https)) and connect out to the world (or tor) to a
proxy port (socks) (and or
two other ports (for http and https or whatever port the input protocol used)).
It would pass http unmodified.
It would break end to end https. If the destination site had an invalid cert,
it would present an invalid self-generated one to the client. If the destination
site had a valid cert, it would present a self-generated and self-signed one to
the client (which had obviously included the shim's root as a trusted
cert), simply
to signify to the client as to validity. Identity would be available
from verbose
logging in the shim and via an http[s] port on the shim itself.
It could furthermore 'tee' off two output ports from it's bottom and receive
two input ports from it's top. These would be a more general hook into
'optional toolchains' located in between the client and server side,
decoding and shuffling the data stream in and out to a toolset at that point.
It should have no 'censoring', caching or other features.. as that is what
the optional toolsets do best.
Note that 'browser' could be anything that can speak http[s], not
just FF/MSIE. So 'plugins' are a non option.
And that the 'optional tool' might be squid or polipo or whatever.
And lastly, erasing your OS and other info from your headers makes you
stand out as an obvious eraser. It's better to use a dead common and up
to date os and browser and then mind your sessions properly.

When others among you are faced with contracts that state
these two things... it may be worthwhile to defer mentioning
what you are running and why (as in the former), until you
have exausted all attempts to get the ISP to hand off the
latter to you. Such as by writing them a note directing them
to forward all such requsts to you for direct processing between
you and the complainant. And that you expect the complainant
to withdraw said complain from ISP in a timely fashion as the result.
Then you can take your case up with the complainant and maybe
they will listen and dismiss.
Yeah, we all know the likelihood of that, but unless you've
sent them the Tor boilerplate and specifically requested
dismissal, there's no point in doubly jeopardizing youself
with your ISP in the very first move.
Now the mafia may not dismiss. But say your line was used
to hack an edu system or post drivel on some board, etc.
Those types may be much more likely to understand in
your explanation as Tor as common carrier. And therefore
Always read your contract and plan your moves ahead.

On the big plus side, OC provides IPv6 function. Most you can
do over native IPv6 can be do over OC over Tor (except maybe
routing which need yet another layer).
So you can do auth via ZRTP, ssh known-hosts, even IPSEC/IKE.
So some good classes of bluffing are mooted by this I believe, no.

No, OC is just a daemon shuffling data back and forth across a
Tor HiddenServicePort. Tor provides a bidir return path to the
source, which the listener (OC) can use, if it thinks it should...
Yes, up to the 80-bit addressing of Tor. OC translates your request
for a v6 address into an onion address and puts that stream through
Yes. Because B's onion is seeing no onion source address. And B's
OC is seeing an arbitrary v6 source address.
Since most protocols require a reverse channel, it's actually B that
is more at risk of sending their data off to onions unknown. Luckily,
that is where B (if human and not a dolt) usually notices something
is broken and quits it.
And it's kind of pointless to do such spoofing because if A wanted
B's return stream, it should have just asked for it. So it would just be
for the lol's of A blindly convincing B (or B's computer, app, etc) to
disclose something to C.
Yes, and as before, OC had plans to do a little OCtoOC ping pong too.
If running IPSEC, etc over v6, learning or making stashes of source
key-v6 associations, that might do it too, more work, same thing.
OC is just another app that plugs into Tor, no different than TorChat.
It just happens to present the user with a cool and immensely useful
v6 address instead of a cute little chat prompt.

What is this bulk account creation you speak of?
The session leak occurs with the non-https intro/splash/welcome
screen that appears right after new account creation. It's a minor
risk though, just change the entry link they have on the splash
page to https, change your password/sec question and log out and
back in.
Hmm, you mean "just", as in today? What exit were you using?
Want to sell the account for bitcoins? Kidding :-)
I'm interested in solving and documenting the technical part of
this issue...
... as I too have tried maybe once a month for the last year or so
and have never been able to create a new account. If it's possible,
it would certainly benefit Tor users to know how to do so reliably.
I also have access to various residential dynamic pools where I can
obtain a different IP/subnet at will. It has been equally long since
I've been able to reliably create a new account via them as well.
It would be cool to map *.google.com to an exit and when someone
here has success, post the exit to see if others can test it
sucessfully. I say map, because Tor often rotates exits during the
creation process time, which can only confuse things worse.
Are you referring to google search? Yes, that service pops up a
message stating that with a captcha. However, I've never seen any
such message appear when attempting to sign up for gmail.
That is exactly what occurs for me. Fill out the one page form, I
select USA as the country in the drop box, hit submit, the next
page is the phone verification, at which point I select "don't want
to give my phone" or another appropriate/true choice, put a little
complaint/suggestion in the comment box, hit submit... and give up.
It is exactly the same whether or not I supply a 'recovery' email
address, which by the way is the only optional item on the form.
About a year ago it seems. This is about the ability to create new
accounts TODAY, without using invites or phone verification.
It is a legacy application, undergoing research for migration :)
And simply having one is still useful to play with Google's other
services in an integrated fashion.

I'd be curious if anyone has success with these.
You'll need to map these at minimum for the US. Sorry, Tor does not

enter them all manually and maybe miss some that I didn't list:
          google.com
     mail.google.com
 clients1.google.com

recall without the CAPTCHA on the signup form page. I want to see
if I can instrument Tor's mapping function to emit host/IP to exit
pairs as each is used or changes to syslog so they are not missed
during testing various sites.

spam from randomized accounts. Don't know if they're new.
I have had ones that old and older. All single purpose accounts
that I deleted when done with them. If I recall, all of them had

Some further thoughts on an already mixed thread...
Ahh, ok, I see, entry-exit correlation/tagging/timing/confirmation...
I guess a longer path length could only help a quite tiny amount
with that by adding some jitter, packet loss, dead circuit churn,
etc in between.
It certainly directly helps a lot against those entities trying to
do simple hop by hop flow/log requests.
Non-exit relay by default wouldn't help regarding the exit part as
no one's suggesting turning up new exit relays by default.
But it could add more guards making observing any useful subset of
them costlier. But also make the less traffic in them more likely
to be yours.
And what if the oponnent runs a hidden service trap?... seems that
then just watching or running the client's entry guard [1] is all that
is needed to confirm both connection and content? Yipes?!!!
I'm no expert. This sounds like a very hard and real problem. Thanks!
[1] One single lucky node, not two, the trap serves as the exit
watchpoint as well.
Are there anonymity drawbacks to having a glut of available bandwith?
Or a glut of legit nodes? Or both?
I've not yet considered that in my suggestion of a model in which
Tor can in fact be used for bulk/P2P transfer and remain resource
Maybe there would also be benefit in a web of trust amongst nodes
not unlike a keysigning party. As with social networking, people
vouch for each other in various ways and strengths based on how
they feel that person meets them. I don't see any reason why node
operators [descriptors] could not keysign and have that web encoded
into the descriptors, directories, DHT, etc.
Degrees of separation could also be encoded, and no web is impenetrable.
So it would be just one more means of scoring nodes. The sigs would
be saying:
Hey, I know this operator in real life or online.
They have the skill to run an up to date, reasonably secure node
and at least check for cold compromise once in a while.
And I would be reasonably comfortable were my traffic to transit
their node, excepting of course lawful order or coercion.
As before, loose, just another means.
Issue? A non-exit relay runs the same bitrate in and out of its interface,
bytes in, bytes out, over time, it's impossible not to. So your maximum
giveback is limited to the lower of your asymmetrical rates because you'll
saturate the slower side at any greater rate.
The unfortunate thing about it is that all four of economies, tech, policies
and outright supression conspire to make asymmetry what you see in
the consumer market. As opposed to cable (and various RF tech and fiber
PON's), fiber and dsl aren't really tech limited to asymmetry. So you're just
seeing the other three in action there. Protest, buy more, or co-op and
trench your own neighborhood :)

Oh yes, agreed, I never claimed signing into OpenPGP WoT was magic
solution. I littered it with soft disclaimers. As before, it would be an
*additional* metric which could optionally be used in selection
calculations if desired.
Save for a few, the node owners are mostly known only by IP. One might
feel better if there was a human keychain wrapped around some of
them. Many of us fully understand the weakness of such a WoT as applied
to Tor, for which there's no requirement to elect to use its metrics.
Much as one may or may not choose to utilize nodes that appear
to reside in certain countries, appear to run on certain platforms, have
cute nicknames, etc.
Were I to be running a node, maybe I'd sign others based on whatever
I felt they meant to me. Maybe others would similarly sign mine. Maybe
the EFF would sign some, maybe Tor, maybe CCC, maybe torservers,
maybe people on mailing lists, maybe FOSS devs, etc, the usual. And
maybe I'd let degree of separation from me or them be a weighted guide

HTTPS cannot be terminated, stripped and re-encapsulated by privoxy.
It passes straight through. I still offer a gold doubloon to anyone who knows
of a good unix TLS proxy/munger. One can dream.
Nicknames are not unique. People should be specifying fingerprints instead.
ie: fingerprint.exit
It's not a socks issue. Until a TLS proxy is available, the most
direct 'fix' would
be a browser plugin that strips it off the host header when it is seen
in the URL...
before the browser does ssl on it. The two results would then get
stuffed through
socks as usual.
That's why, failing enhancement of MAPADDRESS, keeping .exit around would
be handy for clued people... ssh [example.com|10.0.0.69].fingerprint.exit...
is much simpler than managing a MAP. Yet unclued people don't know exit
can bite them in URLbars, so they complain, so there is desire to kill URLbars
to kill complaints from the unclued. Not to mention it isn't a fully
capable method
to begin with.
It should not, Tor only provides passive transport services, and rightly so.
I'm not a dev. And the world is going TLS. So if Tor does anything to
'fix' this,
it should enhance the MAPADDRESS functionality as proposed earlier.
And possibly provide a friendlier human 'domain2exit selection' interface to

Yeah, they're just doing due diligence though.
This is actually good news. Because after at least seven inquiries, the exit
operator is still:
- alive
- free
- has all his computer gear
- quite possibly friends with his regular inquisitors, and though perhaps still
marked as a freedom loving loon to watch, is fun to drink beer with his

Phone calls, visits, temporary arrest, ISP shutdowns, raids, email, data

@_subject: Prepaid Cell Data Plans (was: Mobile Tor stuff) 
I've been doing some prelim on this too. I can buy a t-mo prepaid voice
cell for $20 and activate it fully anonymously on pay-go or pay-day plan.
They don't even ask for a name, which I think is awesome and totally
inline with what a business should be, providing a good/service without
hassling the consumer for anything unnecessary to that end.
However, when I inquired about flexpay, every place I asked wanted
positive ID [self-serve purchase and activation was not available] and
they required a credit card as the only means of refill... not store bought
minute/refill cards. I wanted flex-pay because the minutes were much
Are you saying you've found flex-pay does NOT require these things any
longer? That would be good news to me.
My minute usage was nearing the Boost and Virgin $50/mo unlimited zone.
Boost had gsm phones. Virgin had what appeared to be non-gsm phones.
I've not switched to either yet. The other carriers voice plans were not
competitive with the above three.
I think it's important when people talk of this subject to also specify:
- Requiring real credit cards vs. anonymous debit cards [refillable or not]
- Positive ID / verified real world data [mailed bills, etc] vs.
supplying random
data that is never checked.
Also, I've run into prepaid 'no-contract' 'plans' from various providers that
were two sided. One plan was more expensive and could use store bought
refill cards. The other less expensive one required a 'credit card'... typically
on file, not just on customer demand... as the only means of refill. You can
see this if you detail the kiosks/flyers at any Walmart, Target, Kmart, etc.
Thank you for starting this topic! Although it's not necessarily
directly related
to Tor, it certainly is of interest to Tor users, for exactly the same
good reasons
that Tor is of interest. I hope others can pitch in with their
experiences pursuing
anonymity with various carriers.
I do think the USA is finally beginning to catch up with the rest of
the world in
this area. Provided no draconian ID law is enacted, it will continue to be a win
for consumers and business. Consumers like simplicity and freedom, and a
business that provides agressive service to that end will prosper. Hopefully
the days of contracts and ID's preventing giving your phone away to others
or switching to more suitable services are ending.
Certainly it's safe to assume that, by cooperation or otherwise, various
agencies already have said access to all Tier-1 providers.

@_subject: What can see a server of a Bittorent when I contact with it  
I don't think there's much of anything wrong with using Tor for bittorrent
a) You do all operations in Tor... NO use of exit relays, in other words,
entirely in onionspace. The smart reader will already know how to
configure this :)
b) You give back 6x the bandwidth you use in the form of a relay
set up to provide that much bandwidth.
Sure, there's some additional cost in circuit overhead, but not much.
(b) is the real problem, not many would be users wish to, know how to,
or have the bandwidth to give back, so they don't, and Tor slows down,
so Tor has to anti-advocate using Tor for this purpose.
Solve (b) and (a) goes away as the services in onionspace increase.
Stay tuned :)

Right, no exits needed or desired. So? And? That is not a problem as I
see it. People complain about mafiaa and all manner of things, so just
about using exits at all and bury all operations underground in tor, i2p,
phantom, anonet, etc. Economies of scale will happen eventually.
Bidirectional onion2onion works fine with middleware tools. No need
for torrent or other apps to be aware of, or manage, onion addressing,
or be aware of the Tor client daemon or otherwise. Run middleware, run
app, enjoy.
It is not arbitrary. If you send a meg from onion2onion it traverses
six hops. Same if you receive one from one. That is the minimum cost
of doing business on Tor, in the onion2onion case of course.
That is good start. There is another one online soon I think. Clients
can always ask a configured list of trackers plus those in the torrent,
so it doesn't matter.
It may end up being ok. But never I understand why create a separate
Tor universe. Sure, if want to only do torrent. But that is may not usual
case and steals resources that could be better put to use making the one
single tor universe bigger. You have to run a relay with their system
so everybody may as just well run one within the single Tor universe.
I question registraton and possible future commercial motivations.
Given client's pki, registration should not be needed, just run the client
and use pubkey as self register/track/accounting somewhere.
And there will be major scale issues to solve, why not cooperate and
do that under Tor namebadge as well.

@_subject: What can see a server of a Bittorent when I contact with it  
Why is a domain needed? Unless it's for documentation/community which
would be better housed in onionspace anyways. Bittorrent can be completely
run in onionspace, today, NO exit facilities are required. Sure, onionspace is
all point2point... no layer2, broadcast, multicast or routing... but
typical user
apps don't need that anyways.
What is certain is that someone will do it someday, with or without
Torproject's nod. All it takes is documentation regarding assembling
the already existing opensource tools. Some people I've talked with are
more than tempted to do it. Only reason not is simply because they're
on other projects at the moment.
Why branch when scaling may be more useful and secure? Why not
ship clients that provide a minimum bandwidth non-exit relay by default?
I seriously doubt that's going to get anyone jailed or kicked. And it's
not like you can't stick an install popup in there that frames it right:
'the client provides bw to the net by default. it's safe because all
traffic through your box is encrypted and onioned. yet if you are not
permitted to run a network service or don't want to be known as providing
bw, clicky here to turn it off'.
At least that way when the masses figure out how to assemble the
aforesaid tools, the TorNet will have bandwidth that grows as more
join. Even if that growth isn't enough to cover them, it's still something.
Because right now, every new user is a pure drain on TorNet, and that's
a bad situation to be in. Even if it happens to be self limiting as a side
effect :-)

What sort of issues exist as each new set of say

Oh, I see, I missed that. For a sec I was thinking it was httpd
griping about Host:.
I don't think this is either a) the case or b) if so, all that
troublesome to warrant
a flag. That squid proxy is in AU, either resident on, or in the path
between, exo
and fibr. Exo certainly has the right to run a cache, hell, lots of people's own
upstream ISP's do, transparently. And whoever it is is clearly not munging crap
with exploits, just throwing a valid error page. Test Exo with one down and one
up site, preferably both not in AU. Separately from that, if it isn't
Exo running
the cache, which from the hostname it appears it's not, then it's not even Exo's
fault. Further, Exo has a contact listed, so why not ask them first
before declaring
them lame.
Tor needs bandwidth, and I'd happily take it through a well configured Squid :)

Since I doubt the suggested tests were performed, I did the work
instead. I reached the 'up' website, and timed out on the 'down'
one... both as expected. And I diffed the clearnet and tornet
versions of the 'up' one and they matched, sans 'alteration'.
If one can prove exo is the site with the cache, and that it's
also configured improperly, this case might have more merit.
Can people tell me which of all the websites they surfed today had
a cache somewhere between their browser and the site httpd? Did one
block all those internet paths on a whim against caches? Is TorProject
going to test all exits to examine for potential caches in the path
and flag them all for similar reasons? And what exactly does one
propose to do about all the caches and other proxies it can't detect
because they happen to be more transparent?
I highly think not, on the former three accounts. And 'oops, policy
failure' on the latter.
Some cache in the path in question is ejecting a harmless and indeed
rather useful error message. One that even caught a bug in Tor.
Users are free to block exo in their config, or not. In the grand
scheme of things, I'd suggest it's a waste of time.
So now caches are a security breach too? That's news to me, lol :)
It's up to torproject now. Happy Tor'ing as always :)

As I wrote someone earlier...
It would be easier to just sign the git revision hashes at various intervals.
Such as explicitly including the revision hash that each release is
made from in the release docs itself. And then signing that release.
That way everyone... git repo maintainers, devels, mirrors, users...
can all verify the git repo via that signature. Of course the sig key material
needs to be handled in a sanitary way, but still, it's the idea that matters.
And git, not svn, would need to be the canonical repo committers commit
to, etc.
Thanks for Tor.
---I could imagine that they might try to sneak in a commit to the git
repository. We have a hook that mails all commits to the mailing list,
and we watch that pretty well. But they could disable the hook during
their commit. As I mentioned in the earlier mail, the git tree is made up
of hashes, so they can't just modify it outright. I've looked over the
'git log' output, and didn't find anything odd. It might be neat to do
an automated comparison of "mails that made it to the mailing list" vs
"commits to the git repository", if we wanted another layer of checking.

I was reading these two docs. They seemed to hint that such a thing
existed on the authoritative directories. As that seemed where the
HS nodes were uploading their descriptors/intro points to.  Thus
maybe a disk or control port query would exist for such records.
Or with some minor source change, could be logged upon receipt.
Step two: the hidden service assembles a hidden service descriptor,
containing its public key and a summary of each introduction point,
and signs this descriptor with its private key. It uploads that
descriptor to a set of directory servers.
Hmm, ok, I think I need to read these specs some more.  Well,
certainly some of the 581 are untrusted regarding your A) above.
Does each one hold a full list of the HS's out there? If DHT, no,
it would probably be an even subset distribution. I'd have to read
I can't imagine that logging each HS onion name received would
present any risk to the net. But could provide a handy HS index.

Hi. In regard to the current general discussion regarding Tor

Is there a need for a 'by the books' ISP/hoster based in the USA?
By 'by the books' (btb), I mean... one who isn't just going to kill
your node, blog, files, etc... because someone complained and the
ISP doesn't happen to like complaints or you... but will just claim
common carrier immunity as provided for in usa law. Note that, in
the usa, this generally means that if the subscriber does not step
up to deal with the issue, that the isp is then forced to act to
avoid becoming a conspirator or facilitator... often due to legal
verbage in their contracts leading all the way back to the Tier-1's.
Except I'm curious to get a handle on whether even that is the real
world case... ie: the provider continuing to claim immunity even
if the subscriber fails to stand or be reachable vs. the isp losing
their pipe because of it.
But overall, is there a need for a usa ISP who won't kneel to silly
inquiries unless the law requires them to do so. And certainly won't
do it because they take some lame moral sides to whatever the issue
of the day is. aka: btb.
Having one in the usa may not be good in relation to DMCA issues
but surely also may be good for foreign entities to safely host
what wouldn't be welcome in their own country. But would surely be
ok as free speech in the usa.

@_subject: Relay bandwidth needed to pay back Hidden Service usage 
Say a hidden service makes available a 100,000 byte file. Now
another user downloads that file. There was obviously some 'cost'
in bytes to the six hop relay system for doing that.
Say the user who downloaded that file feels obligated to repay his
usage back to the system by running his own non-exit relay. How
many bytes should he offer back to the network?
It may be more proper to think of it as bandwith. Server serves a
stream 24x7x365 at 100,000bps. User consumes it 24x7x365. How much
inbound and outbound pipe should user provision to replace his usage?
When compared to the internet, the network is a closed system with
finite resources, so the cost is certainly not equal to his usage
[ie: 1x]. His usage causes a depression of overall available resources
during the transfer.
I thought it might simply be 6x his usage due to 6 hops. But maybe
it involves adding 6 increasing fractions? And what about the middle
relays that both receive and send the supply stream?
Tor overhead and packet retransmissions can be ignored. Tor's
configuration limits and the availablity of any given pipe size can
also be ignored as this is only an excercise.
The return tcp ack stream would not be negligible but could be left
out by reference... only if it was simply additive on top of the
supply stream using the same calculations.

@_subject: Relay bandwidth needed to pay back Hidden Service usage 
Some people think in terms of bytes transferred [the file case].
Some people think in terms of bandwidth [the stream case]. In either
case, the solution to the math problem will be the same. I figured
it would be better to think in terms of bandwidth since that is
what is actually being configured.
I can't answer your question directly because it:
 - Mixes bytes and time in an ambiguous way.
  o  One file many times? - That yields the bandwidth case.
  o  One file that takes a year to download? - not very possible
 - Questions the user's motivations. They are immaterial here.
This is purely a math question. The user's motivations are immaterial.
Perhaps the user is feeling thankful or benevolent or communal :)
Bandwidth on Tor is presumably far more scarce than the commodity
internet. Thus relay pipes are more likely to be full. Thus a user
has a higher chance of actually negatively impacting the network.
For which, given a whim, the same user may wish to ensure his use
of the network is given back for others to use. Such that the result
is a zero net bandwidth change, just an overall increase in the
gross. Maybe it was to show the user's possible thoughts about
'slowness' yielding their ideas as to giving back.
Anyways, back to the math...
My mistake. According to the last paragraph here:
 it is: 6 relays, 7 hops.
CLI - CSR1 - CSR2 - RP * HSR3 - HSR2 - HSR1 - HS
I should mention one more thing to assume. That there is actually
free bandwidth on the network. Such that all the users give/get the
bandwidth they want without contention. But just barely. This simply
removes the influence of others from the whole thing.
Same here, that's why I punted the math question to you all, cuz
I'd just futz the answer the way this month's been goin so far :)

It's not just HTTP[s] that needs it, but pop, imap, etc. SSL on certain

e   5 ERROR 504: Connect to  failed: SOCKS error: connection refused.
f 503 ERROR 504: Connect to  failed: SOCKS error: host unreachable.
The breakdown of approximately the same set of Tor connects is:
g 531 Closing stream for '[scrubbed].onion': hidden service is
unavailable (try again later).
h   1 Tried for 120 seconds to get a connection to [scrubbed]:. Giving up.
i   5 Tried for 120 seconds to get a connection to [scrubbed]:.
Giving up. (waiting for circuit)
j 250 Tried for 120 seconds to get a connection to [scrubbed]:.
Giving up. (waiting for rendezvous desc)
Note the port LEAK above can identify the onion if that onion is
using a unique port from most of the other onions. Anyways...
h) Tor should not give up without emitting a reason.
f and g) So this means there was no descriptor in the directories?
ie: blahblahblahblah.onion
b and c) I figure this is a local problem, maybe with the Polipo/Tor
d and i) Does this mean that the onion is there and up but something
in the path or the terminating service is broken?
e) Is the hidden service on the host up but the userland daemon
(httpd, etc) down?
j) This seems to be an actual Tor issue in getting a response from
the directories that could be fixed?
I've noticed that some of the other 504 types will change to
'unreachable' upon subsequent connection attempts. However that is
not always the case. Can the timeouts for the 'TTL' and 'waiting
for' issues be bumped?
Also, does anyone have an update to sdfetch that works with the
current stable or alpha trunks?

So long as more nodes come online, and those nodes have proper family
statements, particularly regarding physical/geopolitical location...
I don't really see any problem with any form of organization doing
this. For profit or not.
Nor any problem with any level of transparency. From open books and
people to the typical privately held black box.
Nor any need for silly "we don't sniff" declarations. That one
especially makes me laugh, because users would be foolish to believe
that there are not plenty of exit node operators that:
a) do sniff, declaration or not
b) are under orders to sniff
c) are sniffed by the upstream doing so per a or b.
and because users are supposed to know that if they're not using PKI
or PSK complete with fingerprint checking, that they should indeed [!]
expect to have their plaintext observed at some point, regardless of
whether or not they use Tor.
I agree in general that due to economies of scale and
SLA/policy/contact setting with the provider, it's probably better to
go for one year term upfront and somewhere between lots of small nodes
or a few large ones.
And yes, more transparency is more likely to successfully raise funds.
Go forth and prosper, the market will figure out the merits.

This is all possible, and in fact, largely required. However, contrary to the
requirement, many providers do not allow their customers to do this.
If you poke around whois using IP address from small hosting companies
you'll find a few examples of properly swipped delegations. Say a /16 farming
out a /22 to the hoster.
You can buy your own CIDR blocks straight from the RIR's just like any ISP
can. But it's not cheap, and you are pretty much required to be well
steeped in the tech and also already in business as a sizable ISP/hoster.

Yes, it's absolutely scary, and should be obvious. There's only maybe
3200 fingerprints out there. Heck, even the local computer club in a
major city could raise enough funds to deploy a handful of early guards,
then drop enough cloud nodes [1] on the net to make the odds of
compromise quite worthwhile... certainly enough for a DefCon/CCC style
executed proof of concept / vulnerability paper.
[1] Rent for a day or so
I'd love to have it be arbitrarily selectable from say 0-25 via the control
port and config, with a default of 3. People already do that with patches,
might as well shit it. And, as in my post about torrent and non-bandwidth
resources, a small subset of 'power users' using more than 3 hops wouldn't
seem to cause much transactional load to the TorNet. Rather, their choice
would likely only hurt their own bandwidth and latency.
I'd also nominate the issue, and others, as further reason Tor should ship
by default as a non-exit relay... and yes, with a nice info screen and a disable
button. There is absolutely no reason not to think the opponent has not
already clandestinely and sufficiently flooded the net with the
current nodebase.
The only workable defense is to deploy the users as countermeasure and
hope that however many users there are... 10k, 100k, 250k? etc, as time
goes by... will make flooding cost prohibitive.
Think of it this way... millions of users willingly and knowingly turn their
PC's into Bittorrent piece servers every day. Want proof, check out the
stats on thepiratebay.org. They happily risk extensive and conclusive
monetary civil suit against them. That's nuts, but they do it anyways.
There are currently very few laws [as opposed to contracts [2]] in the
world that would prohibit running a non-exit [or even an exit] relay. And
any other inquiries would outright fail due to common carrier. Or at most
be relegated to contributory or neglect... a much nicer outcome than the
suit above.
Given the risk is less, it would seem to be well rationalized, justified and
proper to therefore ship as a non-exit relay by default. And reap the
I'm NOT advocating use of anon networks for any less than legitimate
purposes. Rather, that anon networks aren't just some robust grail
for only the people that 'need it'. But that that exact same robust
grail should be integrated by users into the whole variety of their daily
online activities as desired, and offer back what they use according to
their benefit.
With other P2P applications, you're either required to be a provider
or the protocol works against you if you're not. Which means to play,
you have to pay. At least with Tor shipping as NErelay by default,
they'd get a nice "we're helping by default and here's why" screen
and a button to opt out.
I'd announce it as a live enhancement trial to be brought out
in the next few releases and see what happens in regards to
user acceptance and net capacity. Provided scalability issues
are addressed in preparation first.

@_subject: P2P over Tor [was: Anomos - anonBT] 
Thought about the non-bandwidth parts of the load some more...
There doesn't seem to be a need to quantify it with a numerical
estimate of what amount of resource giveback would yield a zero sum
impact for those parts.
Say you're using 'filesharing' in the form of BitTorrent. Your
single PC, when operating as a non-exit relay [1], can surely handle
many times the trivial sum of all the various non-bandwidth resources
described above that you would use along the way. Think of simulating
a TorNet by running all the needed directories, nodes and operations
bound to IP aliases on one PC. Conservatively say [3] you will have
up to 100 P2P circuits at 6 hops each... Any PC should be able to
handle that entire load with lots of headroom.
So long as users are covering their bandwidth with giveback [1], I
think it's safe to assume the rest of their overhead is also covered
by the addition of that node to the network.
I no longer think the standard reply/FAQ regarding such uses of
Tor, excepting [2], should be an unqualified: Tor can't handle it,
so don't.
The answer should be that... so long as such giveback [1] is:
- understood by users to be a necessary 'techical' condition to
 support their use of Tor for bulk transfer.
- indeed provided back to the network as a 'moral' condition by
 those same users.
... they should then feel free to use Tor for whatever they want.
BitTorrent, P2P, FTP, streaming media, chat, etc. And OnionCat is
the shim that will allow the apps to communicate seamlessly.
Though not as simple a response, and requiring donation by the user,
it seems to be the more reasoned one.
Further thoughts welcomed.
[1] It's already established that in order for your use of Tor
bandwidth to be zero sum (in the Hidden Service <--> Hidden Service
case) you need to give back at least 6x your use. So you will already
be running said relay (for the purpose of bandwidth giveback).
[2] Isn't there a proposal out there to better handle magnitudes
more users [and avoid shutdown points] by getting rid of the
directories and self-hosting the TorNet into a DHT or something?
[3] As the average bandwidth that most users [dsl, cable] will be
able to give back is small, transfers will be slow anyways. Which
may limit adoption [P2P peer counts]. Regardless, the limiting
factor is really only bandwidth because (dice up the giveback/6 you
can legitimately use... amongst P2P peer circuits however you want,
ie): dsl/cable = 1 x 256Kb/6 = 10 x 25.6Kb/6 = 100 x 2.56Kb/6

Heh, yeah, no one ever suggested this would happen, as the leecher

And the areas where Tor, or any other anonymous system, is permanently
incapable as a limitation of architecture. Or where the system
actually could be enhanced to better support what some users are
already going to use it for regardless of disencouragement.
It should be noted that one reason people ask about using anon
systems for such traffic is because they feel risk when doing so
in the clear. Either as consumer, distributor or participant. Being
anonymous may actually be the key they need that allows them to run
the seed/server/distributor side without fear. In other words...
I'd bet it's called 'filesharing' because most people actually *do*
want to give back and share, albeit safely.
Is anonymity the missing link to the global filesharing utopia
invisioned be all the various sharing systems? Who knows. We'll

Anonymity is a tool whose use case is rightly selected solely by the
user, not others. As are defenses against it the purview of the latter.
Neither free to trample the other across the divide. It's a beautiful thing.
During such selection, certainly some would consider system nodes
run by those who speak against such anonymity (in whichever the case)
as fine candidates for their excludes... lest they become unreliable
partners (in whichever the heat, or the whim).
Then again, how does one select any particular partner from the

@_subject: Crypto for hidden services [was: TorFaq on https] 
In the hidden service context for all below...
Tor does NOT authenticate any particular underlying service [web, mail, etc],
nor does it encrypt traffic to/from them.
Tor merely authenticates and encrypts between two Tor daemons, one
as a client and one as a HS.
Give an elaborate setup behind a HS, perhaps tunneling the stream
off the server, across the net, to other parties who terminate it on some
daemon or cloud. Maybe some WikiLeaks form of submission/storage, or
joining anon systems, or just a clueless HS admin.
Or that someone is able to read the particular crypto Tor uses, but not
the crypto your tunnel uses.
Would you, or the provider of the intermediate or final services, not want
that extra layer of protection just in case? Your bank in it's internal cloud?
SSH/IRCS/SILC to behind a HS is an extra tunnel. It costs nothing. Were it
still available, no one in their right mind would use ssh -c none.
Perhaps, and quite unfortunately, not. However, even though the
chain would break on the hostname, it would still be of supplementary
value if some dual-homed site of importance to the user ran with the
same cert [fingerprint] as on the internet. Especially given that the
prevalence of the below aside is presumed to be extremely low.
[aside: As DNSSEC is not global yet, multi-homing a non onion cert would be
on the same par as a bogus/stolen cert and mitm dns, for say your bank.]
Not particularly. Though it would add additional fingerprinting
oppurtunities beyond Tor and the service themselves. This is
the only one I can think of.
The whole, well we've got the anon system doing node to node
encryption/auth, why bother with TLS... sounds an awful lot like
why Johhny can't encrypt and why the internet still isn't encrypted.
As there doesn't appear to be any real reason NOT to use crypto
over top of any given anon system, might as well do it just in case.
Foregoing extra 0-day's in crypto libs as applied, and the above
fingerprinting... why pan it?
And PKI, even amongst the anon, can be very useful thing. Communuties
will be built, PKI will help. It's no different than the internet.

Note though that the definition of evil can be game changed
by running your instance inside a secure sandbox, behind a nat,
and minding your session data appropriately. With no access
to the rest of the system and no crosssite cookie/etc trails,
that's a good win. You're really only left with the case of a rogue
applet doing a 'whatismyip.com' to defeat your use of 1918 space
and then sending the result to whoever your adversary may be.
Depending on what the user is doing, that could be a big weakness
that warrants the tradeoff of disabling 'evil' features.
As usual, it would be awesome to have a tool that could de and re
encapsulate https so that proxies and caches could do their thing with it.

The historical existence and use of taps, whether for international/local
intrigue, criminal, research or black/white ops, with or without clear legal
authority, is well documented. Even moreso is the public product line
developed / purchased and capable of use by various GPA's... carnivore,
narus, sql, tcpdump, fiber toys, etc. As is the base interest in research
towards any potential application. It should be assumed that GPA's are
actively present, at minimum in highly active research mode. At most,
that remains to be seen.
Further, simply because there is not sufficient evidence to the contrary,
and because the history of cover ops and secrecy is equally documented...
it should be assumed that any sufficiently large number of anonymity
nodes are, in fact, not run by disinterested kids in their mom's basement.
Just because the IP says residential dsl/cable, some corp or colo
somewhere, or even signed by some seemingly well known internet
figure... as opposed to mapping back to any given adversary... does
not give the user reason to dismiss them.
The monetary cost of owning a kilonode or two is of trivial impact to an
agent capable of making productive use of such a set.
Agreed, writing off a known [or unknown hypothetical] strong adversary
is far better than disbelief in same or failing to see one at all.

Well, no rants, but I'm in qualified agreement with Scott [just
this once, heh]...  that yes, those of us stuck in 80x25 terminals
and antique text comment databases could use a multiline format.
It the project is concerned about the replace vs. add semantics,
one could add two new exclude[exit]nodesmethod options. Where method
is replace or add. Yet it is just an ease of use thing, and does
have a certain impact on downstream controller code. So as long as
the config does what the docs say it does, in whatever mode it ends
up taking, that's fine, people will hack and make do either way.
Config file and controller interface should act the same though.
Also, regarding the interaction with HS directory lookups and
excludenodes... i would suggest that specification in excludenodes
should prevent all contact with such node for all reasons. Or just
make another option for how to handle that case as well. This is
more important than the above paragraph. As one could have a node
that is a 'bad' exit through no fault/intent of its operator...
such as being plugged into a non-ideal isp... yet it would still
be perfectly useful when acting as a non-exit or directory provider.

First I've heard that they require SMS to *USE* gmail.
However, SMS has been required for quite some time now
to *CREATE* a new gmail account. There was a thread a
few months back regarding creation. And to date, I've not
been able to create a new gmail account without SMS from
any exit anywhere on the planet. Nor from any residential
DHCP pool I have access to.
Yeah, they like to pop up red warning banners for avid travelers.
I just hit dismiss, no SMS junk required.
I've never had any problems sending any message anywhere, at all.
Only with new account creation. And the occaisional dismissed nag
When I try creating a new account, without providing an SMS or
other number, there is a form to fill out. I pick "don't have phone" or
"don't want to give number" and explain the same. They ignore it.
And if I recall, the account is left in a locked state. And since, rightly,
no secondary address was provided, they can't reach me anyways.
And any cool account name you came up with dies locked with it too.
No offense to the list, but fuck google. With all their supposed
brain power you'd think they could come up with something
a little less brutal than a sledgehammer. Then again, I don't
blame them... the GECOS, user, pass, contact, recovery,
and mail content is certainly worth many millions more when
combined with a phone number. Pigs.

That was about the time people started posting with problems
creating new gmail accounts via tor. Also, that was then, this being
now, it's completely irrelevant. And you didn't state the exit in use
when you made it so that part is moot too.
As far as I know, I'm the only one who actively MAPADDRESS'd and
tested via a number of specific exits and posted the explicit results.
That's what is needed to determine the current nature of the new
account creation issue. Anecdotes are simply not useful.
My only problem is new gmail account creation. I've never been forced
to supply any SMS or secondary email address to any gmail account
after it has been created (nor have I ever needed to ask them to forgo
their requests [veiled scaremongering "recovery purposes" language] for
them). Nor did I supply either of them when creating my old accounts.
I simply can't seem to create a new gmail account without SMS.
So if anyone discovers an exit or account creation parameters that
work, I'd love to hear from you.

Since using your android is, afaik, the same as giving them your
phone (SMS), or alternate identity, it would seem obvious that this
would work. And thus a non-solution in general.
Many good folks that would make good use of a gmail account
do not have such things. Similarly, many good folks that do
have such things would surely not wish to associate the identity
of such a thing (IMEI/SIM/account/location/life/etc) with any
gmail account just in order to get gmail. So for many, this is out
based on access and/or principle alone.
- Are you suggesting that this simulator runs on a PC using unix or windows?
- What is an "adb_name"?
- And it seems like a heavyweight solution in general. Do you have any
insight into why it works? Such as its use of a certain browser string,
preloaded cookie strings, or other http parameters? It would certainly
be easier for many people to simply mimic those in say firefox than
to setup an entire development and emulation environment.

In my tests to date (limited by free time), yes, that's what I said.
Hopefully from a disposable email address. You know :)
Yes, free alternates that work fine are always welcome suggestions :)
I usually require https (creation and management), imaps (retrieval),
smtps/submission (sending), no automatic addition of addresses
to 'contact' lists when sent via web or smtp, and an outright account
deletion function.
I do use alternates. It's just that gmail... like yahoo and hotmail... has
a certain credibility about it that the moronic public 'trusts'.
When such people get mail from gmx, .ru, .de, mailvault, safemail, etc...
it really raises their eyebrows askance at the sender. Especially if they
don't already know the sender... such as if the sender would like to
establish a new business, social, hobby, confidential or interpersonal
thing with the recipient. All the normal uses really. That's why it would
be useful to the anonymity/privacy community to figure this one out.
Whether by testing, or perhaps even via formal contact with gmail,
followed up with education and a plea for sanity if needed.
I get a red one line warning bar near the top once in a while that
says something like "we noticed you coming from a strange place.
set alert preference, or dismiss/ignore it".
I also commonly get blue/red ones that say "we don't have your
recovery info":
supply SMS
supply secondary email address
both of which i hit dismiss/ignore on.
None of these three nanny nag notices lock me out, require me
to supply the requested info, require me to submit requests to
let me live without suppling the info, or hinder my use in any way
other than swatting down the nags once in a while.
I'm tempted to try their form for new account creation (Mike's blurb).
Yet I don't quite know how I would explain my request (refusal to supply).
And creating another unlinked account elsewhere just for that takes time...
and what happens if I deassociate it (in gmail) or delete it (on the provider)
and miss or hit some sort of gmail reauthenticate wall months later.
Yes, we're all talking precisely about that.
You'd have to ask Mike that. His verbage would be useful to know.

I just don't like their apparent stance requiring SMS/voice auth.
As mentioned earlier, it's a perception thing. And of course all
the other cool Google services that come with an account, and
third-party online tie-ins. And they're one of few that do not put
the source IP/FQDN in the headers... which sometimes makes for more
reliable mail delivery and better perception as well.
ditto + openjdk6 + ia32-libs on Ubuntu 10.10 amd64 updated
Not sure what you mean by this.
Done, but skipped the proxy for now, because if it doesn't work via
clearnet, it won't work via tor.
Note the emulator is really slow. And I've no idea how to enlarge
the screen so you don't have to scroll around so much?
Ok... so....
This menu tree exists for me: settings > accounts&sync
Everything including and after 'add account' does not exist in the
accounts&sync menu. settings > accounts&sync yields just a note
on screen about an Exchange account, username and password.
Again via clearnet, I also tried using the android browser (the
globe ball thing on the screen).  Filled out the page form and its captcha, hit accept/create and
boom, the next page is the SMS/voice verification request as usual.
So no dice there either.

I meant to include with this: no inclusion of source IP/FQDN in the

I've found some too, just haven't had time to test and catalog them.
GMX is next to try.
They just happen to have some really good services and tie-ins that
all rely on having a gmail/google account. I may just cough up $20
for a disposable phone to get that.

keypad/button panels off to the right. All within an X window of
maybe 1024x768.
Anyways: emulator -avb  -wipe-data -scale 0.76
Regarding identities and what is being sent...
# sdk installation
Though I haven't hashed the installation tree, I don't expeect
android/google is issuing unique software packages (with embedded
certs, etc).
# avb runtime
There are notes on the developer blog about various software generated
identities. So at minimum the avd's should be regenned per account.
You could diff the avb dirs. And further unpack/mount the images.
Also: adb bugreport
# host
Though less likely, there could also be access (via java, blobs)
of the host system UUID, MAC address, etc.
# wire
It's https, can't sniff it. I doubt google still has a fallback
http creation interface either.
My guess is that if you torify the entire box, regen the avb's and
maybe change your MAC... you should be safe across accounts. But
to be sure...
There's probably some android debugger that would work to trace the
I/O of the android process that's talking through the stack to google.
Regardless of what's being sent, I'm pretty sure it's using a
lightweight android domain/proxy service cluster within google.

The shortest answer is that strong pseudonyms are useful, even (or
especially) in a well connected social environment. Many people want
to have those links. Many want use some of the services google offers:
Many want to participate in the scene... just not as themselves.
No one here is saying that google is not indeed terribly evil.
Nor does being social or using google services equate to compromise
of one's nym. That's up to the user and how they use it. Some keep
their nym intact, some selectively disclose, some fully.
Google, facebook, twitter, etc are all good entry points into the space,
whether one chooses to do so pseudonymously or not.
If they forbid access from anonymity networks, that element of usage
is broken. So people testing and cataloging what works and doesn't,
and finding workarounds, is a very useful thing.
Some want location masking, some want identity masking, some
want both.
They are no more important to privacy/security than any other provider.
All providers of all services are not to be trusted in that regard. Neither
is anyone who might be able to trump them. That's old news :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] [bug] MAPADDRESS and circuit creation 
I think I found something strange. Consider the following shell
for exit in list_of_exits ; do
 mapaddress example.com=example.com.$exit.exit [1]
 Fire off ten to twenty background processes in parallel that try
 to connect to example.com. Depending on timing and other issues,
 some may succeed, some may fail, some may be waiting their timeout
 retry period due to failure to connect to example.com the first
 time, etc. Think wget here.
 wait - 'wait' them in the shell till they all exit.
 mapaddress example.com=example.com [3]
 mapaddress example.com.$exit.exit=example.com.$exit.exit [2]
 getinfo address-mappings/all
[2] Now this map effectively clears the dynamically made map (from
[1]) to the default (no) mapping. And the getinfo confirms it is
gone. The shell 'wait' ensures that the spawned processes are all
gone and thus do not remain to make further use of the map in [1].
The bug is... sometimes (while for'ing through the long list of
exits), at the end of the next iteration of the loop (and beyond,
until the old entry expires), getinfo will show a dynamic entry for
the previous exit. Of the form:
example.com..exit ..exit "2011-04-xx xx:xx:xx"
My guess is that the processes put in a request for a circuit (by
simply trying to connect). But that [2] doesn't kill that request
within Tor, it only removes any dynamic map that currently exists.
I subsequently tested by adding [3], it had no effect on this issue.
I believe both [2] and [3] should kill any pending requests for
their respective, formerly mapped, entities.
Any thoughts before I trac this?
Also, I see this every once in a while, not real hypothesis other
than something similar going on:
example.com  "2011-04-xx xx:xx:xx"

Never mind that the password is locally backed up and encrypted.

Somehow I suspect those of us having legacy accounts

an account in the not too far off future. Oh well.
At least they're cutely honest with their behind the scenes

Hey, this is important: Add a phone to your account

@_subject: [tor-talk] Better Privacy for Tor Node Operators 
Many (most) residential ISP's allocate their users from DHCP, technically
dynamic. Yet DHCP keys off the user's MAC address, and preferentially,
if available, assigns the user their most recently used IP from the database
in response to a DISCOVER/REQUEST. Been a while since checked, but I
think this is also true if the lease is expired and there is no demand to
recycle the former address. So the user is often effectively static. Some
users defeat this nature of DHCP and obtain a different IP on demand
by installing a new MAC.
It is not clear whether ISP's will gravitate towards providing static or
dynamic when they start delivering IPv6.
For those users who do, by whatever means, end up with a different IP
address each time they go online, and who wish to avoid tracking across
said IP changes by regenerating their Tor keys each time... what is the
minimum recommended time that such a node needs to become and
remain useful in the Tor network? Sub hour, hours, day, days?

Note this covers more than the usual socialnet/mail sites and

How does HTTPSE stack up against the various illegal

not intend for that to be the general access method. Of course
HTTPSE is just an agnostic tool and the user would be
to blame. But it does strike rather silly that a site would
complain when they enable HTTPS over whatever portions
of their site they chose... and a user uses it as such. Oh wait,
that's the 'he said she said' illegal access thing again :)

Yet between the lines for those having brains or being in

I'd bet a home/work/school exit operator gets raided

This one just happens to be one that met whatever
test case the EFF, TorProject and operator felt worthy
enough for joint publication. Note that I don't recall
the source article calling out the specific traffic type
in question either.
I'd run one at home anyday because I feel Tor is
completely legally defensible, worthwhile, and rewarding
in the US. But I don't because I don't consider my house

Tor routers and hidden services use these.
Various other tools can utilize them for sign

can be envisioned.
But I can't put a passphrase on them
because I've no way to start Tor if
they have a passphrase set.
Also, without a passphrase, they are more

Ditto. And even new windows for similar clusters of tabs.
Unless it's a privacy/identity enhancement, I'd leave the UI experience
to the user's whim.
I think torproject is making it's own FF distro? If so, I'd include a doc
that details the changes between it and its current FF parent version
so users can compare or further tinker with changesets.
Two more off topics...
Make the ctrl-shift-del kill everything now function also be a button
on the toolbar. And make both have an option to not require the
popup ack, and perhaps also make a status bar icon flash when done.
Make the toolbar and browser structure background colors, sliders, tabs
etc easily changeable (or doc'd) as a unit. So people running multiple
processes (profiles) can color them red-phone, green-phone, black-phone,
etc for more foot shooting safety.
I'd skip it, for that and bandwidth reasons. ie: akin to multi tab
consumption, with only one tab being the one you want. Better to
include squid if the browser cache isn't sufficient. I don't know.

Just FYI... this will not work for https. It is a dirty hack for anywhere
you would put a domain or IP.
MAPADDRESS is your general use mapping tool that will work
for all sorts of things. But you have to know some things too...
.exit also only works for one host, not the rest of the embedded
server farm commonly returned in a web page. New versions
of Tor allow handy MAPADDRESS wildcarding of domains for this.
(There should probably be a vidalia/torcontrol form for MAP mgt.)
Beware of webpages or other protocols that return
actionable IP addresses instead of domain names.
An enhancement bug has been filed to allow handy
MAPADDRESS CIDR block wildcarding of IP addresses.
There are also gotchas/races related to this that come
up when IP maps are autocreated (from domains) and/or
time out. I forget what they were. It's on the list somewhere.

Putting these two another way...
The internet is probed a hundred times a day for any number of
reasons. Any IP you light up is subject to it. And not only that,
but it will have active, intentional and evil exploits thrown at it.
Anyone not knowing this seriously needs to find a sniffer and
run it.
So to the people who whine of being packeted like it's some sort
of outrage... get real and shut up. If it bothers you, report it.
Others are happy throwing up a filter (or not) and forgetting it.
And if you get cracked, or receive a friendly vulnerability email,
consider it a blessing. The net is just noise in logs rarely read.

Formal scanning, best practices, contracts, etc are great and highly
suggested. However, many of us do precisely this in real life. We know
how hard it is, even in small numbers and with complete authority
and consent. Attempting to apply these practices to Tor, and expecting
the Tor Project to house it would be a laughable proposition.
A scanme flag in the relay descriptor could be interesting. But as before,
it's work, what does it mean, to who, and who would adhere to it.

I would strongly object to publishing any data that is node

throwing up targets for the sort of chantards that inhabit
Tor to simply launch their useless scripts against 4tehlulz.
Also, dropping insecure nodes won't do much but remove
useful nodes... 'evil' entities will want to deploy tamper proof
nodes. (Discovering subgroups of fingerprints across the node
set would be interesting...) Given the trivial cost for such entities
to run said nodes, we actually need every user's node as

A casual observer might be fooled by you running a shell server for people,

The above has been mentioned twice now as some sort of

Some corrective Network Engineering 101 is obviously needed here
before some poor soul ends up mis-educated.
There is NO way to detect passive monitoring unless you have access
to the monitor. Real world passive monitoring involves mirrored
upstream switch ports or optical splitters. No contact, separate devices,
that's why it's called passive. Don't try to mention optical dB loss, spectral
anomalies, bump insertion events, TEMPEST, heat and power consumption...
because, as a user, you don't have access to those. Nor try to claim
anything about running BPF on the same machine as the node thus
overloading the box and perturbing flows or exploiting the listener process....
because that's not proper passive snooping and thus you're doing it wrong.
Now you could properly rename that 'detection' word to 'entrapment'
where you watch for the use of your unique seed. But that's a different
thing, obviously.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have another 100GiB of quietly recorded traffic

@_subject: Is "gatereloaded" a Bad Exit? 
Been a fencesitter on this since posting the note about recording
traffic that helped send this thread over the top. For once, I'm
in agreement with Scott :) (and others)
Badexiting based on exit policy seems rather silly as it will prevent
nothing. And because of that, doing so is security theatre. Which
sends both the project into questionable practice and the user into
misplaced trust. If anything, the user should be educated instead.
Nothing keeps an operator from dropping a gig split between 80 and
443. And if you defend against their rate limiting of 443 down to
a meg, at best you've doubled their cost per eligible volume. No
big deal. And due to typical protocol distribution on the open
internet, if you force all operators to a fixed selection of 'ideal'
policies, the cost per volume doesn't really change beyond that.
It also seems the distribution of traffic around the nodes, operators,
and globe won't change either... a broadbase level up is more likely,
so there's no win there.
Further, take the top fifth of exits by bandwidth, even take them
all. No one can provably say whether or not any of them are recording
traffic. And only a fool would trust an operator's (or shill's)
statements to the contrary. The only way one can be sure is to stand
watch over the node itself, in person.
And lastly, some hat (or entity) packet groping their exit, or
handfull of same, is the least of your worries. They're just a
nuisance. It's the PA's and GPA's that one should be worried about.
Seems everyone forgot that. They will always follow bandwidth,
oppurtunity, interesting things and anomalies. Per the distribution
notes above, and the architecture of Tor, exit policy doesn't seem
likely to be interesting to a GPA.
Badexit should be reserved only for those exits that are physically
broken... modification of expected cleartext, corrupted ciphertext,
certificate games, packet mischief, dns issues, upstream path issues,
The right thing to do with unprovable consipiracy theories such as
exit sniffing, is to push it out to userland and provide tools for
the user to manage it as desired.
Some have suggested various node ranking metrics... Country,
'suspicious' strings in the nickname, 'suspicious' CIDR blocks,
PTR's, ISP's etc, the preselected metrics and exit set of the
'badtornodes' guy, Scott and others, node keysigning parties,
importable wiki [.onion] node config lists, and so on.
Exit policy is currently at the operator's pleasure, need and design.
If exit policy mandates will help solve some Tor scalability or
attack vector issues, in a substantive way, from an engineering
standpoint, fine. But please, don't claim it makes users any more
'safe' from sniffing.

Simply because every good thing needs checks, balances and feedback.
Anonymity systems are potentially disruptive, facilitative of change,
etc. People should not be surprised if *any* such system exhibits
*any* such odd behaviors or deviations from norms. It would of
course be nice if they were spoken.
Tor seems to be doing a good job indicating the usefulness and
application of anonymity to a wide variety of potential users.
Moreso than before. But it does hesitate from suggesting that it
can be used as a check and balance within the user's own particular
state. Which is certainly an equally valid and worthy use case.
Why does Tor not use a fully distributed model? Seems it's allowing
itself to be shutdown by shutting down the Directory Authorities.
And allowing censorship of any given .onion through the cooperation
or coercion of same. Perhaps these are not true, or have been
addressed technically elsewhere, for which a link would be welcome.
Then again, if they're valid weaknesses, and only a technical change,
why not put it on roadmap and do it?
Perhaps others have other concerns or thoughts to voice.

@_subject: Is "gatereloaded" a Bad Exit? 
Of course, not quoted as such. Plaintext anywhere is risky. Yet
this entire thread is about sniffing. How plaintext-only exits
somehow equate to sniffing. And how badexiting plaintext-only exits
somehow equates to reducing that risk. Both are weak premises. And
said exits were loosely defined as wolves whose only purpose was
to log traffic.
Perhaps after the nodes were waxed on the premise of sniffing and
the thread exploded. (Dethreading might show otherwise so no picking
is intended at all.) It shouldn't matter though as certainly folks
would better support decisions to solve anonymity engineering and/or
performance problems that are causing a non-trivial impact or holdup.
Is Tor really at the point where reducing the exit matrix provides
significant or greater win as opposed to updates in other areas?
Does (or will) Tor bundle 80+443 to the same destination via the
same exit? What about http[s], smtp[s], imap[s], pop[s], submission
grouping? If the user is using different functions or accounts with
different protocols, he likely doesn't want this. Better let him
do his own bundling with MAPADDRESS or some toggles or something
and enhance those tools instead.
People are encouraged to help out however they can. Therefore,
operator fiat and whim is, by definition, sufficient reason. If Joe
operator thinks 6667, 31337, 21, 23, 25, 80, 6969, 12345, 7, 53,
79, 2401, 19, 70, 110, 123 and so on are pretty uber cool, daresay
even silly motivation, and wants to support them, that's his right.
Just as he can disallow  He doesn't have
to announce it with some 'no sniffing, pro rights' policy statement
to those that might believe the paper it's printed on, validate his
social ties, be contacted, or otherwise vetted.
If another example is needed, not that one is; Corporate, edu and
other LAN's sometimes think they can block 'ooo, encryption bad'
ports so they can watch their user's plaintext URL's with their
substandard vendor nanny watch tool of the day. All the while their
staff laughs at them as they happily tunnel whatever they want over
that (perhaps even the client or exit parts of Tor). Yes, this kind
of joke exists :)
And another; In some equally crazy backwards braindead jurisdiction,
being able to say 'hey, we're not hiding our traffic in crypto, we
forbid it, so look mr. authorized gov agent, you can sniff all that
traffic you're getting reports about, and we're not in it, therefore
we're off the hook'. Perhaps even in France, etc, with their strange
crypto laws.
There was also mention of exits to RFC1918 space. No ISP with brains
routes this, especially not for customer facing interfaces. Yet
they could simply be exits so that the operator and others can
access the 1918 space said operator has deployed internally. They
might not care to use a (hidden service OnionCat VPN) for this. Be
it due to config, speed, anonymity or otherwise. Nor might they
wish to overload routable address space as an exit to their local
designs. It's just as crazy. But they're all rational in someone's
[I haven't actually tried to map 1918 _in_ to Tor yet, just figured
what can be configured not to go out must be capable of going in.]
What about the users that want to reach their peer, via that only
exit in Siberia whose IP isn't blocked before their peer, that only
happens to only be offering port 80, to which their peer can listen.
It's not a question of whether *we* would do such things or see
them as rational. This is network space, any to any, hack to hack.
One man's widget is another man's stinky wicket. It's the tools
that matter. Tor is a network tool, with a nifty anonymity layer.
Thanks, I yield this hack to be mooted by the project, cool.
Sniffing was needed to determine this :) And, assuming 80 was found
to be the first-most (which sounds right); then in the 80+443(+rest)
case, a sniffer's cost is only raised, say, sub 10%, not double.
So dropping said nodes truly does nothing useful costwise either.
(A days worth of netflow on a faster open exit would show the port
distribution breakdown, if anyone wants to.)
Node testing methodologies are cool. And what can't be proven
beyond that belongs to userland. Engineering is also cool (and
there are some potentially good reasons to normalize exits there,
beyond the crypto/non-crypto port groups to be sure). And all the
various use cases, examples and whims are cool. So why not start
a new thread exploring the engineering and, if valid and overriding
of same, let the exit policies fall prey to that instead. That's
just my lay opinion. Anyways, that's all. Party on :)
This requires a number of accounts equal to the number of exits.
You can even get the plausible sample set of usernames and passwords
to use via sniffing :) This testing idea is perhaps one of few
morsels of win to come out of this thread :)

@_subject: understanding problem, hidden services 
As you've read and itemized the spec, which I'm off to read, here's
my itemized take on the web page...
A Tor circuit means three hops and out to the destination, at least
in the exit case. So applying that three hop definition of a circuit
to HS's would lead to the following summary of that web page:
# init IP's
S <-> SRx <-> SRx <-> SRx <-> IP  # qty: 'some' or 3
# publish desc
S <-> SRx <-> SRx <-> SRx <-> DB  # aka: 1 DA, maybe more
# request desc
C <-> CRx <-> CRx <-> CRx <-> DB  # aka: 1 DA, maybe more till found
# C init RP
C <-> CRx <-> CRx <-> CRx <-> RP1
# inform S of RP
C <-> CRx <-> CRx <-> CRx <-> IP  # qty: 1, of 'some' or 3
# S init RP
S <-> SRx <-> SRx <-> SRx <-> RP1
# full path
C <-> CRx <-> CRx <-> CRx <-> RP1 <-> SRx <-> SRx <-> SRx <-> S
Which is seven hops. Everything is consistent on the page with 7.
Up until this 6 bomb summary is dropped at the end, which is probably
where many people, including me, get the 6 from...
"In general, the complete connection between client and hidden
service consists of 6 relays: 3 of them were picked by the client
with the third being the rendezvous point and the other 3 were
picked by the hidden service."
If so, the definition of circuit needs to be clearly redefined
in this case.
Also... this one needs work too. What is meant by identity? Its
inet address is always protected from everyone 'learning' about it
because it creates its own circuit. Who cares about the HS descriptor
(with public key), anyone can get that. What other reasons, why use
RP's? The HS put up a list of random IP's, not single ones, why not
use one. The client did pick a single responsible relay, the RP.
Or in the IP only case, the IP to use. I think the full path is
joined out of band to prevent the DA's from knowing the possible
meetme point(s).
"One of the reasons for not using the introduction circuit for
actual communication is that no single relay should appear to be
responsible for a given hidden service. This is why the rendezvous
point never learns about the hidden service's identity."
So I'm just agreeing that the web page and even the spec could
really benefit from some clarification on hops and phrasing.
I would also put the images above the text descriptions, seems
kindof like top posting as it is now. And BOLD the step: labels.
Also dug up from that web page...
"Step two: the hidden service assembles a hidden service descriptor,
... It uploads that descriptor to a distributed hash table."
What I've read so far doesn't seem to indicate there is any such
'DHT' in use. It's more like the HS descriptors are simply uploaded
to one or more, maybe all, of the 7 or so fixed public directory
authorities chosen at random... not into a bulletproof DHT. And are
then downloaded by querying the DA's until one is found that has
the desired HSD. At least that's my take on it.
By way of example, the Phantom project uses a real DHT for this
purpose. This makes it pretty much immune to censoring the HS's,
as well as overall takedown. And is stronger regarding being able
to explicitly know all the descriptors that exist by coercing the
DA's to log them (even though it should really be up to the HS admin
to control access anyways, ie: scanning for or leaked services in
the real world). Phantom expects to have a code release any day
And last...
"it is of special importance ... HS sticks to ... guards"
I'd change that to "critical importance" or just "required" :)

Ok, I think it could be written as:
Each endpoint must always be in control three nodes, with whoever
chose the meetme using that as their third.
Assuming meetme's don't apply in other areas of Tor, I suppose it
could be further clarified as:
Each endpoint must always be in control of three nodes.
The Server uses the IP as its third.
The Client uses the RP as its third.
So for each step in the process it seems like this:
# S inits 3 IP's
S -> SR1 -> SR2 -> IP
# S publishes descriptor
S -> SR1 -> SR2 -> SR3 -> DB
# C requests descriptor
C -> CR1 -> CR2 -> CR3 -> DB
# C inits RP
C -> CR1 -> CR2 -> RP
# C informs S of RP
C -> CR1 -> CR2 -> CR3 -> :IP <- SR2 <- SR1 <- S
# S uses RP
S -> SR1 -> SR2 -> SR3 -> RP
# full path established = 6 relays, 7 hops
C -> CR1 -> CR2 -> RP: <- SR3 <- SR2 <- SR1 <- S
The colon delimits the end of each sides control in the full path.
The arrows are build extensions, not traffic.
For the full Client-Server paths, I did not name the relays uniquely
as 'OR1, OR2, OR3, ORa, ORb' as you guys have done, because there's
no guarantee that they are used only once in such a path. AFAIK,
it's possible to have: C -> R1 -> R2 -> RP: <- R1 <- R3 <- R2 <- S
Note the reuse of relays R1 and R2 in arbitrary positions. The only
constraint that holds is that the Client and Server each choose
their own unique relays independantly. I've corrected that above
by calling out who chose them and their uniqueness within that. I'd
definitely do that too in the new spec/page clarification.
Does the code check that since S could be thought to consider RP
as just a destination beyond its "controlled exit" of SR3, and RP
is also just another relay from which S can build circuits, that
RP is in fact excluded from being any of its three relays? In other
words, this might be bad: S -> SR1 -> SR2(really RP) -> SR3 -> :RP ...

---------- Forwarded message ----------
On the whole it's been working fairly well for us.  We've been running a Tor
exit node for about 5 years now.  Officially it is a project sponsored by
one of the faculty in our department who does research on anonymity,
privacy, cryptography, etc, so that has allowed us a bit of leeway with the
university administration in the name of academic freedom, which we wouldn't
have if this was just someone's personal toy.  We did not seek official
approval before setting it up, but we did inform the central IT Incident
Response Team team of what we were doing, since we realized they'd probably
be receiving abuse complaints related to the machine.
On a technical level, we're running on old spare hardware; a dedicated
machine, but nothing fancy.  It's completely stand-alone, and doesn't have
any dependency or relationship to any other system of ours; this was
originally done out of paranoia, in case someone showed up at the door with
a warrant to sieze the machine.  It also logs *nothing*, which turned out to
be a lot more complicated than simply disabling syslog. :)  The system has a
full gigabit speed connection to the Internet and Internet2, but our Tor
traffic seems to stay pretty steady right around 30Mbps 24x7.  I've been
told by the networking people that this machine is the single largest
bandwidth user at BU, which again might be a problem if we didn't have
official faculty support.  Originally the machine was located on one of our
normal internal subnets, but at some point we were given a private subnet
that is located external to the campus firewall, so as far as the university
is concerned, our Tor server is treated as being outside the campus network.
In addition to the normal default exit policy, we have always blocked any
exit traffic destined for BU's own IP space; this was done primarily for
legal compliance reasons, since there are a number of licensed services
available to anyone with a BU IP address that we are contractually obligated
to not make available to outside users.
Initially the IRT simply forwarded all complaints to us, and we sent back an
appropriate form letter explaining what Tor was, etc.  Probably at least 95%
of the complaints were DMCA takedown requests for P2P traffic.  At the peak
we were getting at least one a day.  After about two years IRT decided that
they would no longer bother to forward these requests to us, and I believe
now they don't even bother responding to DMCA notices for the Tor server.
We have periodically had inquiries from law enforcement, at the state and
federal level, US military, other "interesting" govt agencies, and the
occasional foreign law enforcement organization.  These inquiries have
generally been handled in conjunction with BU's General Counsel office,
which required some initial education, but they have been quite helpful and
supportive in all our interactions.  In most cases, these inquiries went
something like this: "It's a Tor node.  Here's what that means..." "Oh ok,
thanks for the explanation, sorry to bother you."  We've had a few inquiries
that required more effort to make them go away, and we're currently dealing
with a more persistent person in the Mass Attorney General's office, but so
far nothing has ever escalated further than that.
Based on our experience, the main two bits of advice I would give other .edu
sites are:
- Find an appropriate faculty sponsor for the project.  If you can come up
  some some sort of interesting Tor-related research ideas, all the better.
  Leverage that academic freedom!
- Inform the IT people and the General Counsel of what you're doing before
  they start to get complaints.  Some education may be required.  Offer to
  sit down with them and explain in whatever detail they'd like what Tor is
  and how it works, and answer any questions they might have.  If they have
  specific technical requests regarding your exit policy, bandwidth levels,
  or whatever, do your best to accommodate them.  Whatever you can do to
  make their lives easier will be worth it in keeping their support.
No problem.  It's nice having Tor around.  Sites like ours have hardware and
bandwidth to spare, and a lot more freedom to act than many other folks, so
it has always seemed like a good match to me.

@_subject: Tor & Email? 
Wish mail could multiply thread replies. Here are combined thoughts
on the related 'Tor & Email?' and 'Tor and google groups' threads...
How many accounts will gmail and the other online entities allow
under one number? Do they crosscheck country/region to number and
are you willing to risk loss of every underlying account if so
or for other 'related link' reasons.
Given that, how many of you would be willing to drop cash in the
mail to provide anon support for the fractional cost of the phone/SIM?
The only real issue is the cost, oversubscription rate and account
linking. Not the anonymity of the physical mobile SIM holder.
Amongst anons there would surely be some honor in this.
In general, when you all are testing whatever service it might be,
and especially since you are already picking the node, please be
sure to state the node fingerprint so others can confirm. Particularly
upon success.
Andrew, I recall you said you were recently (the only one of two
of us) able to create a Gmail account via Tor but did not know your
exit. Do you remember whether or not you supplied a 'secondary'
email address to them? And what domain/service it was?
People should mention the fingerprint and use of any such mail
domain/service when testing. As in my tests of 2010/12/29.
As well as whether they used the 'broken' .exit notation or MAPADDRESS,
what was MAPADDRESS'ed, etc.
Jon, really? Do you recall the fingerprint and any recovery domain?
And no captcha seems very strange.
And Germany would give you  not  right?
Privoxy alters a whole bunch more stuff than polipo. I can see where
it would cause undue problems. I do ad blocking with MAPADDRESS so
polipo is fine.
Many laws and policies say only to check, not record or some other
such scheme. Many folks feel the need to go above and beyond what
is written even though it serves them no particular benefit and
adds to their cost, and in fact risk, of doing business.
Bad will be bad, good will be good. That's why many have no problem
with anonymity, because it doesn't affect that regard. Anti-anons
seem to be really about profiling for profiling's sake, or slowing
the normal course of historical change so that they may continue
to reap the current state before naturally dying of old age.

I've commonly seen exits (or paths) reused within a certain period
of time after issuing a NEWNYM.
For the users that have such a need, it would be nice if Tor could
optionally keep a historical bucket of configurable entry length
(whether based upon time and/or number of prior nodes/paths used).
Such that any such nodes or paths would not be reused so long as
they remained in the bucket according to its expiry rules.
And as an aside, to the extent it is not already done, different
ports on the same host should not necessarily be aggregated over
the same circuits. I'd wager that they should not, so as to appear
separate to the observer. Mostly for efficiency. Think of
checking/writing multiple email accounts on the same provider...
via IMAP/POP/HTTP/SMTP...  without exposing too much relatedness
due to using the same exit for all at once.

When constructing my own path (as a client) through a relay
(running as a separate process on a separate network), I
obviously know from the client controller when said relay
is being used as an entry node.
How can I tell when said relay (to which I have full access)
is being used as an entry node by other clients on the net
(those not under my control) ?
Or put another way, were said relay to be instrumented,
would such identification be possible?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Identifying use of relay as an Entry node 
Yes, that is the question being asked. Whether or not any given relay
can tell if a given connection being made to it is in fact as the first of
the three relays (entry node) that a client has chosen for its circuit.
ie: detecting with exclusive certainty the parenthesized relationship below.
(client > EntryNodeRelay) > relay > relay > [to internet/hiddenservice]
And I presume that once the entry knows it is being used as such by a
client, it can be instrumented with code to follow all of that clients network
activity (time/size/etc) resulting from that particular relationship?
And even if the client is also acting as a relay, by further discriminating
in its following of such activity between activity which is a result of the
entry relationship, and the activity of the plain relay relationship where
a third party is serving as the entry node?

the moment you're doing authorized/legitimate security

I think there are some errors in this document...
=== item 1 ===
line 251:

If 'permanent-id = H(public-key)[:10]' (line 239), and consulting
the definition of permanent-id-byte around line 261, then 'time-period'
changes ONLY as a function of time, as per formula in line 256:
 time-period = (current-time + permanent-id-byte * 86400 / 256) / 86400
not as a function of both.
=== item 2 ===
The paragraph around line 262 gets weird in places...
- The document fails to declare Bob's 'permanent identifier'
that was used for the example. ie: abcdefghijklmnop.onion
- line 262, I show:
(13753 * 86400 - 1188241957) * 256 / 86400 = 51.0903703703
(1188241957 + 51 * 86400 / 256) / 86400 = 13752.9996469907
So the '143' on that line seems bogus. Am I missing something? Where
did it come from?
- I think there should maybe be some preliminary rounding or mod
rules regarding the epoch timestamp. Though I guess integer math
covers it.

I've commonly seen exits (or paths) reused within a certain period

For the users that have such a need, it would be nice if Tor could
optionally keep a historical bucket of configurable entry length

Oops, there's word swap in there :)
Again, oops. I did mean to remove the instances of the 'path' word
from the above, as I can't see now where it would serve any purpose
to bucket paths. Only the exit bucketing part was what I wanted
to say. I've modified the quote as such. I don't presume your note
applies to the bucketing of only exits? If so, how? As I don't see it.
For example, I commonly do network testing. I want to hit NEWNYM
and never see that same exit over some number of future new TCP
connections. Since some of my destination sets [say port 80] have
the following truth: usable exit count >= number of destinations,
that would work great for me.
I again corrected the path word above to exits.
There was an excellent proposals summary posted to dev recently, so
I'll head off to read that before replying further to this part. Yet I will
leave an example. Say a user has multiple email accounts at a provider
using  the same reasonably common GECOS field, 'Bob'. Or the user
may be messaging the same remote destinations from multiple unique
Now, in order to provide an extra degree of separation, the user can:
1) use only http, and have to newnym between serial use of accounts.
2) use http from one exit, https from another, smtp/pop from one,
submission/imap from another. Four accounts, four exits, in parallel.
All to potentially the same single mail provider's IP (fronted by load
balancers, whatever). Excepting human factors, and observing source
addresses, the provider would see the usage as different users. That
separation is a good thing in the anonymity space.
[let's ignore for now that newnym buckets haven't yet been implemented
so as to enable that reliably without explicit exit mapping... the same exit
may recur at some unpredictable time in the future, afaik]

@_subject: [tor-talk] New Tor paper: One Bad Apple Spoils the Bunch 
Having briefly read these... all the mentioned attacks
seem to rely on whatever apps the user is using being
tricked into doing things involving the public IP space.
Assuming the user's apps are bound to RFC1918 space
and residing behind a packet filter that catches all traffic
and forwards it to Tor, these attacks appear to be nullified.
The only drawback being maybe the apps not working too
well due to end to end connectivity issues as a trade off.
Sadly, many users bind their apps/hosts to public IP addresses,
configure them to use proxies into Tor instead of packet
filters, and give them free access to their entire filesystem.
Should it be of any suprise that these 'attacks' apply to them?
Perhaps rather than 'attack', the phrase 'user error' would be
more fitting?

Wouldn't a more capable MAPADDRESS function

Though I can't find it at the moment, I know maybe
a year ago I proposed augmenting the MAPADDRESS
function to handle both:
- Wildcarding domain names at dot boudaries. Perhaps also regex.
- CIDR block notation for IP ranges. Perhaps also list notation.
Because unless you know all the various FQDN's and IP
addresses some company like Yahoo uses to provide its
services (which you don't), you're going to have holes
in your MAP. If server A in their cluster sees you from
China, and server B (that you didn't knowabout and therefore
missed) sees you from Germany, that could yield quite
unpredictable service, extra authentication, loss of account, etc.
Anyways, just throwing it out there. Where might someone

Should I add all this to the ticket?
Yes, per the above posts, add CIDR block mapping as well:
95.0.0.0/17 -> 95.0.0.0/17..exit
For MAPADDRESS entry marking purposes, it should allow any IP
address, so long as the address lies within the block boundary:
1.2.3.77/24 -> 1.2.3.77/24..exit
I know at least FreeBSD allows you to configure interfaces like
that, with both the address and netmask in one string, so you could
find a code example for the address within boundary thing there I'm
There are more examples in the above posts, particularly:
host: 45.2.1.7/32
everything: 0.0.0.0/0
Address list notation might be as such:
I might further suggest extending the MAPADDRESS parser to handle
Type Of Map declarations and defaulting unspecified ones to the old
style for backward compatibility. That way each type can be maintained
separately and new types can be added modularly.  It may be desireable
to replace the underscore with a space or a slash.  Not sure about
that yet. ie:
MAPADDRESS_DOMAIN *.foo.com
MAPADDRESS_CIDR 1.2.3.4/24
MAPADDRESS_LIST 1.2.3.{7..9}
MAPADDRESS_LEGACY a.foo.com
MAPADDRESS a.foo.com
This might be further enhanced as well: getinfo address-mappings/
all = everything
DOMAIN, CIDR, LIST = as above
LEGACY = old style entries
And of course, removing any entry from the map remains the same:
Stop further dynamic mapping by setting the source=destination,
thus removing the request to generate dynamic maps:
Remove a specific dynamic entry by mapping the full exit=exit:

@_subject: [tor-talk] Logging in to Yahoo e-mail accounts now failing??? 
I can speak for no one else... however I think that any provider of online
services that does this is foolish. First, and let's be frank, all providers
of online services (mail, shopping, personals, search, etc) rely on you,
their customer, be you paying or ad-supported, to be with them, to
remain in business and to make money. Whether you come from
a proxy or not, you see their ads or pay them money or build their base.
Further, in this day and age, global travelers, especially paying ones, are
very common, and valuable to the economy. To lock out an account
because yesterday it was accessed from the US and today from Bahrain,
especially with
such services provided entirely via https, is flat out ridiculous.
Further, those
who really care to take protection of their identity into their own hands,
while STILL valuing the service by seeing the ads or paying the subscription
fee, should be cherished by the provider of such services. Sure, they may be
limited in what they can still sell about the user on the backside,
but still, that
is a monetizable revenue stream. And further, business, personal, and
contracting people DO travel, access different LAN's and have various
work/personal ethics to uphold. Therefore their use of proxy networks,
VPN's, such as Tor, to do so, are completely appropriate.
Honestly, any company that bars access from such networks
should be called into question. And MOST certainly any one
that does not allow the user to remain in control of both their
authentication and usage via https, and their location and privacy
via proxy services.
I write this merely because I'm certain many of these businesses
are shadowing this list and need to understand their customers
points of view. Your clients do like you, refer others to you, and
DO want to use you. Just not when you do needless things like
blocking travelers or users of various proxy/vpn networks.
I would pay hard cash, via anonymous money order, or cash in
the mail to be able to donate to certain commercial services I like.
Perhaps in reference to a certain account, or anonymously in
support of the service itself. You guys are missing a HUGE market
share by not allowing this and insisting on personalized credit card, etc.

Well if CA's are giving intermediate CA's to adversaries, and those
adversaries are issuing certs MITM on the fly in hardware... then
yeah, you've got major problems.
Same for if the apps are bundling random CA's as trusted.
And for CA's issuing certs (same subject, different hash) on demand.
The traditional answer to all such things is still:
- Verify and enforce the cert fingerprint, ignore the CA stuff.
- Verify and enforce the DNS.
- Hope your adversaries don't pass on the above attacks and then
simply obtain the real cert and redirect your IP traffic to themselves.
But you watch your hop count, latency and server particulars right?
Then your adversary mimics those, so...
The only defense you have left is context, particularly human
factors. Whether in real time (a recognized voice, video, data
challenge, etc), and perhaps aided by crypto chained back to a
former, known good, session (ZRTP, etc). You're not supposed to
pass sensitive data unless you know who's on the other end of the
channel first.
Even via Tor, people who don't have anything to worry about, generally
don't have anything to worry about, unless their padlock icon is
broken. If your money, etc, is siphoned, with a good icon (via the
above weaknesses), and you can't get it back with an affadavit,
choose another financial provider.

Sure. Yet it's just another question that still has to wind it's way through
congress, LE, and the courts. It pretty much boils down to whether or
not multi-use tools can be banned. Will computers be banned? What
about the maker of pen, paper and mail? Bernstein and lots of other
cases say no. So:
1) Keep on making a great product everyone loves.
2) Push and embed it as far, fast and wide as possible so as to make
removal a laughable concept, even for lawmakers.
Underground developers will pop up (using Tor, haha) if need be to
avoid injunction against any current legal entities. Directory servers
would become more distributed with bootstrapping going to a friend
invite friend model. Then it's back to those pesky questions above.
Wouldn't worry about it too much anytime soon.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What is tor used for? 
Tor is used for a lot of different things. Sure, the kiddy pron, drug and chan
waste and all the talk about those things is disgusting to see infiltrating
everywhere. But with nothing to do about it you just have to ignore it.
Yes, it would be cool to see stuff like EFF, EPIC, ACLU, Red Cross and
whatever else makes you happy all be multihomed into the anonymous
space. But really, if you can't get to them on the clearnet, or via Tor exits,
you probably have worse problems on your hands, like finding work, food,
shelter and not getting shot. Nor do they see it as being all that
helpful to them.
On the plus side, lots of people use Tor for totally benign and boring everyday
stuff, I certainly do. Think about it... IRC with friends, dating,
reading the paper,
contributing to forums and various projects, blogging, doing your banking and
school stuff, email, internet and systems work, looking for work,
writing freely with
random people, buying stuff. Whatever it might be that people do. It
all feels just
a bit better knowing your ISP. employer or government doesn't really
have such an
easy task anymore of cataloging or quoting you, tracking your home/work/travels,
turning you into a statistic, optimizing your online experience, or
any other such
things you might not want to happen. These certainly aren't examples of 'working
for the greater global good of humanity' or whatever, but it all adds
up. Kindof how
anti-spam systems reduce the profitability of spam. And in a way,
gaining back some
of the anonymity by default that everyone had before everyone and everything
went digital, online, databased, monetized and controlled in the 90's.
It's unlikely you'll find those who really need Tor for their
activities standing up and
saying here I am with their use cases in hand. They simply have better
things to do
and that would entail risk.
You're more likely to find relay ops and coders evangelizing to the
good. They are
the interfaces to the use cases and know what's out there. Just seeing
packets flow
through the occaisional relay I prop up makes me happy knowing at least some of
them weren't full of the aforementioned trash... even if they are just
our boring
daily stuffs.

What makes it legal or not is what you do, why you do it
and what you do with it. Law is different from policy and
contract. And they often do not fully line up or cover the
same things. And LE is different from prosecution/defense,
from judge, from jury, from law school and on the street.
The question is not specific enough, so no one can answer it.
The project site, people here, users and other operators
all have similar expectations. Some transgressions result
in node blockage. Some operators do whatever they want
as some things are unknowable or unenforceable.
Operators may for various reasons be raided, sued, or
shut down. That has it's own problems. So far in the USA,
due to the various exceptions available to operators, there
are no known cases where the operator was found guilty
or liable. Criminal guilt is different from civil liability.
Some modifications are legal, some are not.
Ownership is not the same as models of use. You have
different limitations and permissions with different usage.
Generally yes. Note also any TOU/AUP/Privacy contract.
This question is not specific enough for anyone to answer.
There are cases where you may look at content, or not.
And cases to file criminal, civil, or not.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Email through Tor and VPN questions 
Regardless of whether or not any provider routinely maintains logs...
They may choose to ignore requests for records/action from those
having no authority over them. Or they may choose to provide
records/action on a whim so long as it does not hurt them. These
two occur quite frequently in the ISP space behind the scenes.
And usually completely independant from the marketing and sales
teams who wrote the website.
Since most VPN services are one hop solutions, any 'legal' request
for the production of records/action is very likely to produce the
source records sought, if they exist. 'Action' refers to closing
accounts, future making of records, etc.
Tor, I2P, and Phantom are designed to make it impossible for such
standard traceback techniques to work. They do that very well.
Using BT with Tor, or any other system, may not be 'private'. See
the torproject blog for why. So long as you share entirely within
Tor/I2P... and as long as you figure and give back your bandwidth
as empty pipe... that would be private, and network friendly. I2P
has a much larger group of 'private' BT users.
All Tor does is make your machine appear to come from somewhere
else... that could be more 'private'. If your mail client inserts your local
host/net into the headers before sending to the remote MTA via SMTP,
that could be bad. Inspect your own headers to see. And use Wireshark
or whatever to make sure you're going over Tor.

My belief from study is that there are NO laws in the US that require
internet services to ask for or keep anything. In finance side yes,
certain things are legally or contractually required. But server
logs are not one of them. Server logs are generally kept for business
metrics by legitimate mega corps, they're in it for money, not soul.
And to look good or feel good when an incident comes in. Also, note
that having no logs will much faster result in lobbying for logs,
than taking a balanced approach.

I'd be wary of that approach. It would be some work for me to verify

if it did, if any closed binaries/firmware on that system are involved
in the process, they could easily be sending your
MAC/UUID/serial/IMEI, etc over TLS as part of the signup process.
Which as you use further apps, services, and surfing would be linked
to that. I don't know much about Android hardware/software, but if

Be careful the words... this is like saying the US Gov is doing great

And although I might trust Tor, it's not wise to trust a GPA such

with law enforcement etc against SR. Even without that, it's pretty
easy to presume some reverse mail covers against the sellers
are in effect. SR's only been around for a year or two. It takes
at least that long for any really big sealed case to go down in
public. So we truly must wait much longer in order to presume
the statement in (4) is true.
Tor cannot accept known 'illegal' money, therefore acknowledgement
is moot. About the best Tor could do is be able to accept anonymous
donations in the first place. Then publish a bitcoin address for donations
from anyone. Then surely some unaffiliated and helpful bird would send
to SR the links to that address and to this thread.
Not sure, but I think at one point Tor accepted bitcoin, but then recanted.

Ditto. Onionland is mostly defaceable forums thrown up by newbie
admins to feed their addiction for the content that is the forum subject.
There's always a flux of normal stuff announced by hacker/activist/other
normalish type folks. They seem to die quickly for what are probably
common reasons. Onion has a lot of potential for human rights type stuff,
anonymized blogs, non-selective reporting, etc. And it's certainly already
being used for that, just that you can't see it because those users have no
need to be public, they only need to communicate and get their work
done in private. Overall, I suspect the truly 'normal stuff' is well, normal.
No one has the time, and if they did, they'd do it on clearnet because,
well, it's normal. Though unfortunate, drugs, CP, carding, harassment,
etc... will always be disproportionate here. We tolerate it and fight for
anonymous systems because there is more important greater good
going on.
My main concern is the node authorities. It's probably easier to
take down seven or so fixed IP's for some sick twist on contributory
crime, than to legislate away a more agile future form.
Everything found on Tor can be found on clearnet or in real life. Tor's
not too special in that regard. And good old fashioned police work at

This is where Phantom has a huge advantage over Tor... always on, native

Torproject isn't inventing select cases, they're the only cases they
can publish.
And they do so for two reasons... 1) Attract funding 2) Attempt to stave
off legal action to shut it down... such standoff hopefully made possible
through big sticks doing the funding, and a verifiable subset of published
use cases.
There's nothing stopping anyone from forking Tor, throwing it up on
github and moving to an unfunded, unspoken development model to
do all these things.
People can even fork their own and specifically pimp it for drugs, guns,
contract killing and CP. It won't do them or Tor or either's users any

@_subject: [tor-talk] torsocks is broken and unmaintained 
Preload (as in torsocks) was invented to hook the network system calls
for apps where there was no socks5 support. Expecting an app developer
to code-in a secondary Tor lib when they haven't thought or bothered
to implement the simple standard SOCK5... is a pretty far stretch.
Besides, socks5 in a client has more uses than Tor in a client would.
I would much rather see socks5 support in wget, elinks, mutt, fetchmail,
etc than be limited by having to link them against Tor. And as a bonus
those apps would then use the socks option when compiled statically,
as it is built in. Right now you're forced to stay dyn so preload works.
Socks5 is thought a simple Tor connection library, it just doesn't do
any native Tor things that linking to an actual Tor lib might do.
I don't really like the idea of limiting myself to just the apps provided
with a given network system. I2P is a bit hard to use with your app
of choice, even Tor is that way in some cases. That's why I generally
advocate looking closer at Phantom, it works with any modern app
(yes, that means IPv6).

@_subject: [tor-talk] torsocks is broken and unmaintained 
This 'mess' doesn't seem to have anything to do with Tor,
nor is it Torproject's responsibility to do any such audit
on any app other than Tor itself, or by extension those it
maintains or chooses to partner with.
As said before, torsocks/proxychains/etc are just hooks
invented to catch certain types of network system calls
so you don't have to go around patching a socks5 client
into thousands of apps that should have had it anyways
or deploying packet rules and jails.
Yes, it would be great if all apps supported an optional:
'./app --socks5=host:port' argument.
But if the app speaks anything other than TCP + UDP-DNS,
trying to get it to work with Tor is useless anyways. And
that's not Tor's problem either.
Yes, you can run Tor+ocat, or Phantom, or i2p+ocat. At which
point you give up exit functionality to gain a useful new
hidden world.
The solutions to this faux 'mess' are exactly what people
are doing today:
- Beg the app coders to put and maintain socks5 in the apps
that use just TCP + UDP-DNS. Also beg apps to be able
to bind to a specific address, not just '*'.
- Use packet filters and jails to redirect everything.
- Make sure preloads do something with all possible calls(2).
You don't need a 'Tor lib' because:
- All it would do is effectively what a preload does via socks5,
because you haven't cited an application use for any of the
native Tor functions such a lib would bring to an app.
- You can probably make do with the features Tor is growing
regarding multiple SocksPort's.
- You still need the app coders to code in the bits for
'./app --tor=host:port' and such enhanced functions anyways.
- You're still limited to TCP + UDP-DNS.
- And it makes no sense to have this Tor lib be full enough
to talk to Tornet without the separate Tor daemon, it's just
not efficient beyond one instance.
And that's just at the network layer. The payload layer address
gotchas (ie: FTP, torrent) aren't Tor's responsibility either.
The problem is not Java. It's that with the sole (known?) exception
of Phantom and its native IPv6 interface, the rest of the entire
anonymous network space has not been designed (lack of thought
due to forebearing art?) to allow common apps to bind to and route
packets in and out of them. Nothing you can do in the long run but
redesign the front end those networks expose to the user. And to
further redesign their insides if you want exits and/or exit binds.
Because expecting the world (IETF, POSIX, etc) to change its
protocols for you and your secret internets just isn't going to
happen anytime soon :)
I would question if it's not better to put those coding resources
towards making the above changes in anon networks and/or
towards spreading them across the already written popular apps
in order to make them work with the anon networks.
I don't agree with telling everybody using Unix command line email
software is 'old advice' and that they should instead use webmail.
Of course if I thought said software was going to go down some
rare case code path and fire off a SOCK_RAW, it would be different.
But we know that's not the case with this class of software.
Only with your popular windows binary app of the day, and trojans,
for which Tor is again not responsible to check for.

For sure. Some might say that network operators like control, like cops

It's something rogueish on their network that draws heat, has a reputation,
is misunderstood because their knowledge is moving packets not the
freedom/crypto/app/legal space... and they don't like it. Just like IRC servers,
NNTP, BT, etc. Unless you pay them to play. Though there are a good number
who don't mind or who help these kind of projects, so credit is due in
that case.
Tor could easily send a rep to give a talk at the next nanog conference...

I am going to try getting some Windows users to use OpenPGP.
I'm looking for whatever the top two or three apps for that might be.
It should definitely be able to do a standalone edit box, cut, paste
and file based operations for pasting use with webmail and other
nonintegrated local and mail/file purposes.
Bonuses, though still acceptable if provided by another PGP app:
Plugins for the major standalone email apps.
Plugins for mac/droid/etc phone based email/text.
I'm googling and just didn't want to miss anything good.

Sometime within the last few weeks I witnessed a user's
gmail account becoming locked due to use of Tor via their
'strange location' 'hijack detection' mechanism. After going
through the 'reset' process as directed by gmail, they were
unable to reset and instructed [1] to wait about a weeks
timeout before trying again. Gmail's knowledge base on
the matter made specific reference to 'Tor' and anonymizing
So just take note that if using Gmail and Tor, you may
encounter this situation. I have not yet. Nor have I heard
that user's subsequent timeout outcome.
[1] Perhaps, and likely, entirely due to said user's refusal to
supply any secondary / out of band authentication forms such
as: secondary email address, OpenID, or their phone number.
Their username and password were still intact and known,
and they always use https.
Personally I think Gmail needs to bury a "leave us anons and
corporate VPN'ers alone with this business about 'protecting us'"
option somewhere in their config, or just notice Tor/VPN/Proxy
and do it by default.

Free Haven and others have done some work towards some sort
of global anon p2p persistant store. It is very hard to do. Whereas
simple organized anon block pools are, well, simple.
I'm aware of one list (any others???) where meta and hacking talk
regarding different anonymous/p2p systems sometimes appears:
p2p-hackers at lists.zooko.com
Though Tor, and/or its community contributors, might choose to write a
shim or collaborate on an interface in order interconnect any two
particular protocols (were it even possible), there certainly won't be any
coding of a given protocol clone directly into Tor just to save install.
This is just the most effective response to the typical use case by the
typical masses. It would be wiser to learn how to sandbox any given
application, so that when those applications fail, at least there is another
layer standing in the way.

      entries automatically and uses manual country code assignments to
      fix the remaining 10%. See src/config/README.geoip for details.

It was nice when things were not blocked as much. Keep in mind that
in the last three years or so Tor has gained significant usage among

generally making a mess of things via Tor. Cracking and spam have
always been what they are, and are not much trouble. But being a turd
invokes helpdesks and policy and management and even LE.
Especially on social2.0 sites... facebook, twitter, dating, forums, etc.
I don't think anyone really knows their blocking models. One would
hope it is not blanket Tor. But per ticketed IP address with an expiry
period. Better yet, just nuke the offending account so as to leave
the IP's free for the good users.
Torproject could speak up here as to the general contents of
their dns exit query system logs... say, out of the 20 most popular
social, dating, resource, etc sites... we see bulk queries from
n of them.
Not sure I agree with the provision of such a service other than
it would be done anyways, so why not. And presumably any big
service would inhouse it.
You can always open a counter-ticket to unblock the IP, at least that
way you force them to include that class in their monthly desk report :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] some clarifications on hidden services ... 
I always thought that document needed a bit of editing as to how things
are phrased, better sectioning out of each step, number of nodes/hops
chosen/controlled by each side, etc. Will look it over again, been a while.
Also, I think rend-spec.txt needs clarified about how things
work regarding:
    506    At any time, there are 6 hidden service directories responsible for
    507    keeping replicas of a descriptor; they consist of 2 sets of 3 hidden
    508    service directories with consecutive onion IDs. Bob's OP learns about
    509    the complete list of hidden service directories by filtering the
    510    consensus status document received from the directory authorities. A
    511    hidden service directory is deemed responsible for a descriptor ID if
    512    it has the HSDir flag and its identity digest is one of the
first three
    513    identity digests of HSDir relays following the descriptor ID in a
    514    circular list.
That covers the first set of three (as being the first three after your ID).
But where is the second set of three, making up the six, located?
Hmm, I just noticed...
Pretty sure it's the 'replica'. If so, that and it's current values [0,1 or
1,2 or ?], should be cross referenced above "based on replica number"
and around line 274.
    273        "replica" denotes the number of the replica. A service publishes
    274        multiple descriptors with different descriptor IDs in order to
    275        distribute them to different places on the ring.
The octet map of a v2 descriptor should be included around  line 222.

@_author: grarpamp 
@_subject: [tor-talk] some clarifications on hidden services ... 
Like circuit length, I believe the spec allows for an arbitarary
number of IntP's
in the Rendezvous-Service-Descriptor. But I don't think there is a widget for
soft adjusting either yet. Likely because the benefit to most would be minimal,
unless your IntP's are being flooded.
Also, you are 'announcing' (publishing) to what is likly 2x3=six(6) HSDir's a
list of three(3) IntP's. None of which 'relay' the userland traffic of the HS.
That job belongs solely to the RP (and the client and HS paths to it).
As an aside, since the clients pick their RP at random, that also covers a
busy HS's need to spread its traffic load across multiple frontend service
paths (though it's still governed by speed of said paths and its EG's).
I'm sure there's a trade off in not having all the HSDir's all carry all the
RSD's. Probably just in HSDir speed/traffic (were such a backend carriage
protocol needed) vs. any given success rate of whoever is trying to DOS
the current HSD subset in an attempt to de-index an onion (which
cyclically evades with time anyways, ad nauseum).
It would be interesting to see if such roving floods on HSDir's and IntP's
are observed in the wild. With the old versions of RSD's, the fixed authorities
were probably flooded for that purpose as well.
Seems like a distribution game. Assuming that's what you meant by the question.
Last thing about rend-spec.txt...
    188    The reason is that the introduction point does not need to
and therefore
    189    should not know for which hidden service it works, so as to
prevent it from
    190    tracking the hidden service's activity.
Assuming one has a list of known onions... one might therefore be able
to metronome
the fetching of the RSD's (from what may be observed to be their own HSDir), and
distill the IntP's (easily compared with their own node address). So I
question the
quoted sentence, and the utility of the observations to a censurious
at least for the duration the RSD is valid.
I think that upon removal of certain release trains from the consensus version
list, references to old protocols should be git committed out of the docs to
simplify their reading.
I pre-admit if wrong on some of this.

On to more useful comparison....
It monitors your queries and results from google/bing/etc
and then p2p's those results into it's cloud for everyone's
It is also a proxy shim between your browser and
said sites. Meaning that when you use the TLS version
of those sites, your use is useless to seeks as a seed.
Further, everything is moving to TLS, so seeks will die...
Unless a TLS de/re-encapsulator proxy is made, or it turns
into a browser plugin. My vote is for the capsulator, it is
sorely needed.
Yacy is a crawler. It's results will be broader and deeper
than a crowd driven pop contest. Afaik, it handles TLS
just fine.
Both seem to be able to take site submissions from the user.

@_subject: [tor-talk] on the topic of tor's weaknesses 
Doesn't this mean bad news for users of hidden services, and to a
lesser extent clearnet services (since they're not as 'illegal' and thus
maybe lesser hot targets for snagging users). IE:
Sting runs a HS and an entry. Thus Sting has full packets, timing,
cleartext and logs of anyone that builds: clientA <> entry <---> HS
There may even be these additional structures to the left of clientA's
entry, for which the role of entry may switch to relay or exit, but for
which entry may be still able to discriminate among on its left...
clientC <> relay
clientD [...] <> relay <> relay [...]
It may take a while for a clientA to use said entry but when they do it seems
it would be quite easy to time/count correlate or munge the HS traffic of
clientA. And only require two nodes (hs, entry) and no GPA taps to do so.
Can such an entry know when it's being used as an entry by
whatever appears to it's left? I think that is what I describe
relies on.

@_subject: [tor-talk] on the topic of tor's weaknesses 
============================== START ==============================
Though I did not explicitly say so, I implied the current state
with phrase 'take a while'... that today's client picks an 'entry'
node and makes it one of its 'guards'.
I'm guessing equivalent. Unless using encrypted clearnet services.
For which (and under the above two node example) Sting can no longer
prove user was involved with certain content on the far side without
legal process to the host. Due to cost, time and log sync issues,
Sting would obviously prefer to run their own service, were it legal
to do so.
Though HS is more hops away, I doubt it would affect timing or byte
counting all that much.
I was just unsure as to whether the entry (guard) could be instrumented
to, in fact, tell when it is being used as an entry by a client to
its left. That's the dead giveaway in this two node case afaik.
And Msr. Syverson seems to indicate that it can be.
My example is not about 'locating HS', only to locating users
(clients) with [an entry (guard) and an end node (clearnet exit or
If it was the example, by similar construction...
Unless the last relay before an HS (indeed the HS's EG) could know
that an HS is the next jump to its right for some subset of the
traffic to said EG's right, Bust (as opposed to Sting) could not
pair its deployment of said HS_EG with its own client data pump to
find the HS.
Again a general picture:
client <> clientEG <> relayN <> HS_EG/relay <> HS/exit
Yes, the weakness seems clearer now. Unless there's a way to modify
the system so that the EG does not know it's an EG for a given
client stream to its left, it would just be a foregone fact of life
as part of the unsolved timing/etc attack class.
How much of a risk is it? Perhaps only canaries, or a realworld
test undertaken on this list, will tell.

If vm1 can ping any configured address other than its own and its

This eats a ton of cpu/ram as it has to be one process per login.
And it runs out of desktop space too.
2 - Find a browser that firewalls the tabs from each other (SSL
session keys, cookies, DOM, scripting, data, metadata, etc)...
everything compartmented within its own tab.
AFAIK, firefox is not capable of this, at all.
I read Google Chrome treats tabs as processes, but I don't know if
their isolation is considered safe? ie: On the same guaranteed par
as Firefox profiles seem to be.
For that matter, I don't know how good Firefox profiles are. But
so far it seems clean. But XUL, XPC?
Any thoughts on Chrome or a better model than [1] above.

You're fine. It makes for a good compendium. Which was something I
wanted from TorButton... just what exactly does it do, so I can
pick and choose bits to put in a profile. If the doc gets too big,
try splitting into a short concept doc for everyone and a long tech
doc for those interested. Add a progress box for each todo item so
people can see how far along things are and when they want to jump
You had asked once about tabbed vs. new window and read-ahead speed
usage. I'd specify that when user spawn off tabs (crtl-mouse1, open
link in new tab) that the data is shared between them, obviously.
And I agree with deprecating TorButton or whatever. Better to put
the resources into fixing the browser. Especially given we have
profiles already.
Anyways, I don't think I need to be concerned with inter process
(or profile) communication. So in the meantime, that seems the safe
bet. Oh RAM :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] IDEA: Compress traffic at exit 
I think this is a question is of compressing traffic internally between
the exit or HS and the client. It's pretty clear Tor should not be
sending 'Accept: gzip' or whatever headers out past the exit or HS,
aka: the destination site.
I doubt such internal compression would help, because the bulk of
data behind the bandwidth is uncompressible... multimedia. Back
in the 90's when text was king and crypto was rare, sure, it would
have been a win.
Is there a bandwidth rate sweet spot at where dropping in a new non-exit
relay will soak up enough users to put its fairly massive new complement
of CPU/TCP resources to the network to good use? In other words, I figure
any PC has far more of those resources than bandwidth. Unless it is
perhaps an exit, or anchored to an HS where it's swamped with
connections as a focal point.

It's up to the user or exit operator whether they want to run

@_subject: [tor-talk] IDEA: Compress traffic at exit 
People could run netflow logging on their exits and easily rank
things by port utilization. Then when you see TCP/80 up there
in the top 10, you can dump off an hour's worth to disk and
test the compression ratio there. Since Tor is port agnostic
internally, just dump everything going in the directions you
care about. It's rough due to it be a layer 1 instead of application
layer tap. Still, uncompressibles stick out as near 1500 byte
packets of just that.
This is science, not the tapping card, so don't trot it out.
I don't know where to point you for such an application layer test. That's
an if we can, is it being done question. Any vendor of ISP cache hardware
will happily spam you with their observations about the net :) Or fire off a
note to nanog.
I don't see a distinction between ram, disk, linecard or wherever.
Just like 'storing' [voice]mail. So long as it is being done agnostically
as an ISP would, it would hardly be an indefensible issue. That's like
saying gmail is responsible for all the gerbil pron scattered amongst
it's disks. Of course if one starts caching only gerbilpron.com, yeah,
that might be kinda hard to explain as being a hands off approach.
They came to you because of the traffic. If you can explain
that, you're in pretty good shape. If not, well... . In my jurisdiction,
gerbil pron is highly frowned upon, so even with disk encryption
or ramdrives, I might be inclined not to do it unless at a datacenter.

Well, very few places take cash or money order in the mail. Call

Building a persistent nym is handy if you wish to establish such a
personage for compartemented tasks, etc. However, there are linkable
nyms and unlinkable ones.
Advocating that users or sites evolve to support only linkable nyms
is not a good idea. For example, the 'invite' or 'cell number' type
nym systems are an example of terrible privacy policy.
People need the ability to create new, unlinked, taint free, accounts
whenever they want. They many need more than one persona, or to
come back as a fresh incarnation of themselves when up against
unwarranted/irrational dislike.
Linkable nyms are worthless for some people and purposes, so I've
no problem with that lack.
If I ran a system, I would allow signups from anywhere, no 'recovery'
email, no name, no cell, no geoip. Nothing but username, password,
and a few strong captchas to keep out the bots. Maybe even a time
delay (n days) to calm down the impulse users. AND definitely... a
policy that allows me to nuke misbehaving accounts at will. Because
let's be honest, if you've got the helpdesk cycles to learn all
about VPN's, scrape proxy lists, scrape Tor, sink ip's etc... you've
surely got it to sink accounts on verifiable abuse reports. Come
on people, hitting 'delete' just isn't all that hard, especially
when your policy permits it.
Do NOT penalize those who need multiple random unlinked accounts
by blocking ip's, making up nym systems, etc. Penalize the accounts
that act up. They are the bad ones, not the former.
I would actually donate much more to Tor/EFF project if I could
earmark it for a formal emissary to talk with some of the sites
I've seen implementing bad policy. And hopefully report back to me
with the positive results ...
... because when I do (under a separate unlinkable nym of course), I
end up ignored as the expendable small guy.
Exactly! And when I can't use these sites in perfectly good,

crap blocking policies... it pisses me the fuck off.

That you want to block the original sites to prevent future issues.

Curiously missing is submission(587) which is RFC'd to be
the authenticated and usually encrypted means for submitting
outgoing mail to the provider of your  for delivery
to your recipients  That delivery by the server may then
happen over smtps(465), which is really just encryption over
the same old (open)relay or  endpoint smtp(25) config.
25/465 can have starttls and auth, but 587 does by default.
587 is more important for users sending, while 25/465 is
now usually for mail servers in the backend cloud.
A side benefit of 587 is that reports often stop at the MSA, as it
is their  and they deal with it. Whereas with smtp relay,
they just see the source IP and report it to the ISP, who then shut
down your Tor node.

I am not talking about wget or trusting CA's.
I'm talking about pinning hosts down to whatever
fingerprint I've chosen to accept before completing
the connection to them. Fetchmail etc, by example,
can do this. Simple, infallible [1].
Why bother trying to do all these ways to hack CSR's,
be your own CA, when you could take the example of
fetchmail, configure a fingerprint, and be done.
Not saying that FF can do this yet.
And what about FF's 'are you sure want to connect
to this strange cert'... 'accept one time' or 'add and accept
forever' option? So why not dump the cert in the forever file?
But if that's not checking _at least_ the fingerprint, and hopefully
the cert chain, then it's useless for security.
[1] And no, I'm not talking about being faked even with
use of DNSSEC (without first configuring the real dotroot
fingerprint too).
[1a] Or of not using at least SHA1, or SHA-3 soon.
Too bad, I checked elinks, lynx, curl, wget, fetch...
none do fingerprints. So yes, someone somewhere
should add fp checking to them. And while you're at it,
add the ability for them to speak to SOCKS5. Seems

If the FF 'forever file' is doing a binary compare of the cert,
or a print compare, then find how to add your server certs to that
file as it would be safe.
If it's a CN, subject hash, serial, CA, or any other check, if's useless.
They are talking on it, so maybe.
But you probably need to say you want to 'pin' the server cert.
Or show an example of another program, like this fetchmail:
 via pop.gmail.com
 ssl
 sslcertck
 sslfingerprint "B8:AF:A7:80:CD:E2:31:50:6F:ED:0E:4F:C8:04:D6:CD"
I have only the needed signing certs in certs dir for sslcertck CA

And sslfingerprint for my real security guarantee.

Is this that big of a deal? If a would be Tor user doesn't

And given 90% of these users use windows, they're set

Yes, no UDP via Tor. So once said hapless user manages to get
their clock set and strapped up, just scrape it off google or some
internal consensus once a half interval and be done with it.
In fact, since afaik Tor's entire trust is based on what the
top level dir auths say, all other nodes besides auths likely
have no need to consider time... just sigs. Even auths might
not need to either... rather, just publish good timestamps for

@_subject: [tor-talk] [Bitcoin-development] Tor hidden service support 
Hello everyone,
a few days ago we merged Tor hidden service support in mainline. This means
that it's now possible to run a hidden service bitcoin node, and connect to
other bitcoin hidden services (via a Tor proxy) when running git HEAD. See
doc/Tor.txt for more information. This is expected to be included in the 0.7
Additionally, such addresses are exchanged and relayed via the P2P network.
To do so, we reused the fd87:d87e:eb43::/48 IPv6 range. Each address in this
80-bit range is mapped to an onion address, and treated as belonging to a
separate network. This network range is the same as used by the OnionCat
application (though we do not use OnionCat in any way), and is part of the
RFC4193 Unique Local IPv6 range, which is normally not globally routable.
Other clients that wish to implement similar functionality, can use this
test case: 5wyqrzbvrdsumnok.onion == FD87:D87E:EB43:edb1:8e4:3588:e546:35ca.
The conversion is simply decoding the base32 onion address, and storing the
resulting 80 bits of data as low-order bits of an IPv6 address, prefixed by
fd87:d87e:eb43:. As this range is not routable, there should be no
compatibility problems: any unaware IPv6-capable code will immediately fail
when trying to connect.

@_subject: [tor-talk] [Bitcoin-development] Tor hidden service support 
The document (Tor.txt) assumes the bitcoin user has taken care of
that. So no bi-direction needed (I am not TorProject).
Seems it's used only within bitcoin code to distinguish which proxy
or native IPvN path to send bitcoin traffic to (or receive from).
It might be simpler than managing onions, i2p's and whatever else
throughout the code and the private bitcoin p2p mesh.
Though I don't suspect it will conflict [1] with anyone's use of
OnionCat, GarliCat, or Phantom... it would just feel odd configuring
bitcoin to use Tor or I2P proxy ports (or Phantom native) when you
could conceivably just dump the IPv6 traffic to the OS stack for
handling once you have the *Cat shims and Phantom set up. They do
have a point about about ocat as a shim for their purposes. And
Phantom is a special case in that it's all native IPv6 interface,
no proxy or shim needed or provided.
I will quote an additional note from bitcoin-devel...
"Note that while the hidden service support in bitcoin uses a
compatible IPv6 mapping with onioncat, it is _not_ onioncat, does not
use onioncat, does not need onioncat, and wouldn't benefit from
onioncat. The onioncat style advertisement is used because our
protocol already relays IPv6 addresses. The connections are regular
tor hidden service connections, not the more-risky and low performance
ip in tcp onioncat stuff."
FYI. There have been a dozen or so onion:8333 nodes and maybe some
on I2P long before this work. But I think could only be used as
-connect or -addnode seeds with some extra host setup. Never tried
it since -proxy was sufficient. Seems this is a simpler and full
[1] Well bitcoin wouldn't know to offload traffic to any of those
blocks, or a specific host on them, if you had them set up locally
via *Cat or Phantom... for bitcoin use. It would probably end up
half useful similar to the above FYI. But that would just affect
bitcoin, not whatever else you were running on them.

Short hashes unavailable, so it would be truncation, which made

I had also thought I2P could generate keys, but reject putting
into operation those that fall outside of some desired mask
range, say only use first 80 bit of 256 space. About the same idea.
Could be problem that 80 bit is not necessarily strong future days.

Therefore anything is possible. And if you're not proxying the output

Wanted to add a bit here from another view.
I see no issue with bulk data transfer, so long as you give
back empty bandwidth equal to your impact on Tor.
If you're using an exit, provide an exit/relay at the same bandwidth
as you use by it, 3x-4x your use due to hops.
If you're using an onion, provide 6x-7x what you use in return.
If you can't, then yes, you're being a leech upon Tor.
Whether it's OS updates, pron, youtube, torrents, it's all
the same... bandwith and circuits. Whether entirely within Tor
(onion2onion) or via exits. Please compensate via giving back
your impact accordingly and all should be fine. If not, yes, Tor
will fall over and you are to blame. You know what to do, do the
right thing.
Any OS worth its salt will do updates via TLS and
check certs, etc. But really, why can you NOT adjust your
rules and update times to do your updates over the clearnet
directly??? Seriously, does anyone block or infect clearnet
updates for which Tor would truly be needed? I highly doubt it.
And if they do, is Tor any more trusted being overlaid over
clearnet? No. So just use clearnet.
Yes, I would not trust Windows to not broadcast your MAC
or firmware ID (which is not easily or authoritatively changeable
under win) to their update system, nor your MAC/UUID
(though lesser so) under unix.
But is that such a huge concern regarding updates? It's
going to send ID anyways regardless of network. So hell,
use a legit wifi station for it if you care. And your system
and usage should be configured and datapartitioned well
enough to be strategically immune to zero-day's and other
risks anyways.
For that which is corruptable by local third parties, yes.
But once it hits the Tier-n WAN provider, I rate it all
the same.
And I have zero doubt that you are somehow giving back
far more than you consume. Whether in data or by other
more philosophical means :) Is that not the goal we all should
strive to?
This doesn't sound like a suitable metric. I would expect it
to mete out benefit equal to one's donations (which does
not exist yet). Plus some sort of gift for good and penalty for bad.
But since that is undefinable, the broad publication of expected
practices, such as appropriate giveback ratios when using various
protocols over different paths, is a far better approach.
It is specificallly for this reason that ALL distribution systems should
heed the by now well publicized warnings and sign and encrypt everything.
Those that do not in this day and age should be treated as laughable.
Thanks for this link... very interesting to finally see some projects
getting closer to TLS proxy de/en-capsulators and modifier streams.

Unfortunately, I know of none that do OpenPGP right. Such as signing
their git (sha-1 tree strength) repos upon init and each release tag,
distributing keys with said releases/announcements, and integrating
that so on down the chain, into updates, and beyond. Honestly, I
view it as a shame upon the major unix systems such as Debian
and FreeBSD who should truly know better and are in the best
position as free communities to do something about it.
I'd even venture that Windows may be further along to date,
save only for their incidence of general system exploits :(
Never saw much use for these in the anon sphere. Not like clicking
update now is that hard. Beats regularly broadcasting your existance.
Similarly, and particularly as to being able to match to your system ID
once they have it in hand.

I think both are useful. Using TransPort as a safety packet log
and proxy catchall for whatever apps might defy Socks/DNS Ports
is a wise thing. One can use both together with appropriate rules.
And honestly, for the average user who may not be able to deal
with individual SOCKS app setups, TransPort is a general win.
Provided OS docs as to the forwarding filters exist.
One OS doc, or a hundred app docs, choose wisely for overall benefit.
Yes, a lofty goal. Yet respectfully, this is impossible. Torproject is not
applicationproject. The level of disjointness is far and the risk is merely
a bum commit appproject away. TransProxy is therefore a necessary
and welcome catchall.

'All bulk data' was the intended meaning. Assuming copyright is not
going away, certainly operators would want to see the complaint
generating portion of bulk move solely and natively to the undernets
under some sort of giveback model. To save for non complaint data.
It is not fair to assume bulk data = bad or worthless. Is the giant
second insurance file released by Wikileaks bad? Are Nina Hartley's
sex ed videos bad? What about the USA state of union video speech?
Or some dying grandma's video memoirs?
Much rather see guidelines for everyone as to how to do it
right, than to punish or prohibit. Because everyone knows
restrictions get routed around or left behind.
Sure. So no problem to use legit anon wifi at coffee place if you
want speedy update. Then phone home is no problem.
On trust... some mention that they trust exits (and thus node ops)
more than clearnet. Well then, node ops can set up WSUS onions and
deb/BSD update onions and you can trust them too and not use exit
bandwidth at all :)

It will happen when one of their mirrors gets rooted, or one of
their devs gets their machine, and thus their dev account, rooted.
The kernel.org, gnu/fsf and debian[?] incidents all come to mind.
Too bad it seems we'll have to wait for that. Not that this is a
strike against them... the projects are likely simply busy.
Signing packages isn't enough... the chain has to go all the
way back to the repo itself. git (dragonflybsd) makes that
possible easily. svn (freebsd), cvs (openbsd, netbsd) don't.
Sorry, off topic.

Nice graphic :)
Some small details not worth including...
site.com under HTTPS really means site-IP to various observers
between user and webserver. site-IP may or may not mean site.com
in the presence of virtual hosting schemes.
At the exit and beyond, knowing a site user is using Tor could
be presumed by use of the known exit IP.
Relay 2 doesn't know any named user is using Tor.
Relay 3 doesn't know any named user is using Tor, when under HTTPS.
The GPA's typically reside in the unshown tier-n internet cloud.
The nodes reside in the mini red ISP bubbles, linked into the cloud.
As to doubts about the current possible state of affairs...
Wait a sec! So an academic can borrow their departmental compute
cluster and prove GPA is workable. Yet massive TLA's with say $50
billion budgets can't move to spend a few million to patch together
a global array of hosts, in their already existing racks, on their
already existing taps, over which they know juicy info flows and
'social' network graphs exist? And for which people who like 'doing
good for their country/business/people' would die to geek out on
the $50-$100k salary, fun and access they might pay to do it. Come
on, get real. Other investments surely pay off with more frequency
and plaintext. But even as a testbed, and with limited or targeted
global visibility, production research seems doable and maybe even
profitable. Regardless of whether it could be easily/directly used
in civilian matters.
Global logistics is already done. For example, every bank, shipping
service, airline, manufacturer, etc... has a network node in every
one of its locations. A GPA is nothing special in that regard.
Maintaining the secrecy of it all might be the hardest problem to
scaling up beyond either a specific target, or the occaisional
matchup as circuits transit a number of domestic taps/nodes.
Whether or not GPA is deployed, everyone knows whitepapars, taps,
interest, shell companies and bankroll and vans, and flat out
cooperation exist.
Setting aside the taps, what if half the 3000 nodes are 'The Man'?
At $35/mo a year of them is $630k. What's the budget of your adversary
and its friends again?
'non-exit relay by default' might be a good way to drive their odds
down and costs up on that a bit. I don't know.
Taps or nodes, if such an adversary might have an interest in you,
I wouldn't wait for the canary before donning your mask.
There may not be anything to do about it, now or then. But without
at least some part of the greater community always thinking about
solutions, there never will be.
One solution may involve somehow furthering the cause of distributed
private mesh networks. GPA is possible because of collusion with
large single entity backbones and or knowing where to tap profitably
and or secretly. Moving the global model from hierarchical space,
to distributed mesh space would make that harder. When facebook
parks its cluster on Joe's well connected 'better than commercial
ISP' wifi, the cause has succeeded :) (Note that a mesh need not
be wifi, neighbors to neighbors with cable scraps works as well.)
Not happening anytime soon though, not before the whole 'thou shalt
not run vs. freedom of speech vs. wiretap vs. data retention' thing
As Tor is being used by those who are either friends or enemies
with their GPA of choice, having it on the chart seems ok food for
Someone will read it. Being behind happens, no worries :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Awareness for identity correlation through circuit 
Does this ask for using a pre existing load balancer solution?
Can the host's firewall be configured to fan out (say round robin
or flow based) the streams (and dns) that it would normally capture
and send to a single TransPort and DNSPort... across multiple Tor's
providing same access ports?
I hesitate to accept the suggestion that torsocks (the preloadable
library) be suitably adapted to fan out to multiple SocksPorts.
Because some applications don't work with it, such as those that
have been statically compiled for other reasons. And well, torsocks
is a curious hack to begin with.
Some balancers can send certain fractions of the traffic to different
locations based on administrative maps. 0-9a-f here, g-q there, r-z
wherever. Flows are turned into hashes, hashes are routed.
Though only a single Tor instance with 'stream isolation' could
guarantee the use of separate exits. And of course only up to the
current number of exits before parallel use is required.
You mean maybe try flow based isolation? ie: pairing src/dst/tcp/udp/port
as a blob that needs separated. Also include .onion as a dst.
Someone implied websurfing by mentioning referrer's. Ignoring the
src port in the flow would help a user stay with one exit for the
normal 10min timeout. TrackHostsExits would extend that as usual.
A busy client often has hundreds of circuits in BUILT state with a
handful new circuits per second and tens new destinations per second.
I don't know how the exits are distributed among those circuits.

Subject only to Tor's defenses, such as CIDR block restrictions, a
node is a node. Going with the USA idea: what if the FBI, in the
normal course of business, calls up all their local cable/dsl/fiber/cell
providers and has a few lines run to each office and outhouse
nationwide. Not enough nodes? Maybe they offer their workers free
internet access and give them a secure little 'router'. Or use
routing and vpn tricks to buy/borrow enough CIDR safe node IP's
from whoever and route them all back to a node farm for easier
Only the node list needs to be classified against FOIA to prevent
blockage. Once the tech is figured out to the point that product
is producible, the remaining thing is what can be legally done with
it all. Warrantless and dragnet tap projects are holding up pretty
well so far, right? Certainly targeted actions are no problem.
No news of Tor daemons being cracked to date, right? Isn't Tor full
of nodes running all sorts of untrusted software under less than
perfect admin skills? It's pretty unlikely that 'chat room' busts
use Common Criteria systems either.
There is this thread for starters:
 I would also look to make sure the timing to a node makes sense
with its presumed geolocation. It should never be shorter than
possible, nor really much longer either.
Perhaps the threat is unlikely, but not impossible.

Yes. They are two separate camps. Who now more regularly talk with
each other to varying degrees, both in the office, and in the pub.
It's likely only a legal question as to what tools either may use.
Then saying, 'hey, we have this program', seems not a big deal.
Based on 4+ year old methods up against a first time case.
What were the lessons learned? What gaps are being filled?
Of course. That's why I put out possible examples that would only
utilize publicly known methods. There are no secrets in anonbib.
Secret projects have secret nets with secret admins...
I'm not really suggesting that any such global or national all
seeing system is in place. Only that given budgets and current tech,
the odds are surely not zero on some of the scenarios.
Particularly concerning results available even with limited visibility.
Such as running both a HS and an entry node that a user happens to
use. Or running enough nodes that having an interesting circuit
transit all three/six is less than a rare occurance.
Scaling Note: If the network needs to scale, such as keeping nodes
very busy but not saturated, non-exit relay by default (NE-RBD)
could be metered out by way of a client self enabling it (or whatever
other scale factor) based on the client's/relay's own fingerprint.

What is msmtp?
Coverage on msmtp-users at lists.sourceforge.net ...
Hey all! Been using msmtp for a while, pretty cool :)
Now I'm in a new situation where having an option
to send ALL of msmtp's traffic via a SOCKSv5 server
would be immensely useful.
I check and grep entire source code for 'socks'
insensitive and there was no result :(
So I guess this is a formal request to add that. I'm not
sure if there is a ticket system to lodge enhancements?
I dont think it would be much work.
Note also in addition to TCP, DNS should be sent via
SOCKSv5 as well... at least in the form of connect
requests. This way there are NO traffic leaks of any kind
when using the SOCKSv5 runtime config option.
Seems a new option like:
would work fine. And the matching config file
statement would be needed as well.
Though v5 is more important initially (IPv4, IPv6, DNS), both
v4a and v5 could be implemented. Then use:
With each definition in the config file able to use
either (version) or none (no proxy) as usual to other
config params do.
Any other ideas or usage bits for this?
Thanks :)
You can find all needed starters here:
One list subscriber, who shall remain anonymous, said in reply...
Bastardizing library calls with LD_PRELOAD only works
with dynamically compiled binaries. When your msmtp
or other app is statically compiled, it's useless.
LD_PRELOAD games are also subject to overloading
upon each other, require third party tools, and can
run up against API issues too I think.
Similar things can be said for chaining to msmtp external
proxy/socat-like tools regarding complexity/configuration.
A native implementation internal to msmtp is would be
better overall solution :)
A patch that makes this an optional feature would have a chance of
being accepted (if it does not introduce problems), but I will not
write it. You either have to find a volunteer or write it yourself.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Socks5 and msmtp 
Hi :) I think the motivation is to make the use of SOCKS with msmtp
simple. Which generally means SOCKS being added to msmtp itself.
Certainly not only for Tor, but also for biz, edu, and gov firewalls
as well. Lots of good use cases there that are as yet unserved.
And certainly more users could point msmtp with:
msmtp --socks-host=host:port --socks-version=4a|5
than will ever figure out LD_PRELOAD or have it available
to them.
In the particular case of Tor, nodes do not provide SSH access from
which to tunnel. So a SOCKS solution is needed.
I'm just a user getting some talk going on this and hopefully a
volunteer coder will jump in.
You mean which SOCKS library? That is a good question and one anyone
could help with it via the usual means... searching, popularity,
maintained. As with msmtp, it would have to work with Unix and
Windows. So ANSI C or something that doesn't need porting effort.
Try this for starters:
It's the Unix way :) But pipes are one direction and won't work.
Socat does not provde a SOCKS server, only a client, so it can't
be used. I mentioned it only as an example of an interesting shim-like
tool that might be out there. Not as one that could be used in this

Ok, sure with that, but well the presumption is that security conscious
users would _want_ to be checking both the cert and the fingerprint.
That being the same sort of users that use Tor.
At least they should be doing that, given they care to use Tor.
Hmm, I think that's the same meaning as running 'separate daemons'.
Which is why this thread exists, as a suggestion that a SOCKS5
option to smtp would much enhance/solve things.
I'm rather certain Tor has a v6 ticket and active development

I guess draft the use case and usage spec, pick a socks5
library or write one. Taking some of this from what's been
posted by people so far. Get it to the msmtp list.
I'm not really any good at C at all, so someone would have
to tackle that. But wherever msmtp makes a connect call
to a server or anywhere else, option it to proxy via socks5
routine I guess.
msmtp's complement, fetchmail, speaks of SOCKS in its
docs, mentions a couple socks libs. But I've not tested
fetchmail with them yet, it should be.
I think there's also a capable 'm' complement for fetching by
the same author as msmtp, but I don't remember its name.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to Control middle Nodes? 
For hidden to hidden, consider using onioncat.
Tor provides a SOCKS5 proxy on port 9050 by default,
so using privoxy just increases latency and config, it
is not needed.
There are lower speed codecs in G.723.1 and G.729(A).
Maybe Ogg has plugins too.
Latency is the larger problem and testing it is hard since
isolating a single node for through Tor testing can only be
done on the average after discounting the other nodes in
the path. Easier would be doing some GeoLocation and
try to ping prospective nodes in the clear.
High bandwidth or low user rarely equals low latency.
You will need to create your own circuits using
the Tor Control Protocol on port 9051. Read the
man page and:
control-spec, socks-extensions, etc.
You will need to write test and circuit building scripts.
Might as well post them when you're done.
Maybe no one has done this yet...?

I've been using torsocks for years. Some comments:
- The formal name is 'torsocks', everything else is an alias
that should not exist.
- It's a silly name because it is Tor agnostic, call it 'ld2socks'.
- It has had multiple authors.
- All authors are effectively dead.
- It needs some work.
- It needs a home for such work.
- It is not necessary given TransPort and DNSPort.
- But it's awfully handy. Especially [!] with mail apps such
as fetchmail, msmtp... ssh... any sort of Unix command
line thing.
- Handy enough for torproject to host it? I don't know. Without
an active coding maintainer it would be just a pile of tickets.

I think this would require signature of the client on a configuration
message to the server, and the server must authorize that signature
first. And to have a signed encryption channel. Otherwise all sorts
of imposters could do bad things to the lengths.
Of course I would prefer this general solution case, as opposed to
running another Tor instance just for this configuration of a private
local onion.
There is probably some good utility in being able to set up two levels
of VPN depth per your needs (4 and 2 hop):
client node node node HS
client node HS
Both I2P and Phantom allow control over the paths you own.
But I don't believe anyone has yet thought of that you might own
both ends and want this kind of depth selection and authorization.
We can see interactive performance with SSH with the
standard Tor 4 hops to clearnet. And is usually not too nice.
I hope to test some clearnet 2 hop VPN service with double
encryption to feel that part.

HOP = An action you take, a river you must leap, the
distance between two nodes.
ZERO hops = no motion. degenerate, no packets can move.
ONE hop = no nodes between you and the destination.
TWO hops = one node between...
N hops = (N-1) nodes between...
I also showed defined 2 and 4 hop pictures in a previous post.
Yes. I don't mind restrictive options, even by default for the masses
that use it. So long as the same binary may also be configured
to do any other useful/custom things that may come up under the Tor
model... node directories, node selection, onion encryption, circuit
management, isolation models, etc. Tor is still young.
There will be a day when you can open a port on Tor and have
traffic sent to that port travel some fixed path or a dynamic
path governed by certain parameters... independant of how any
other port operates :)

Yes. Not Tormail, not Gmail, not Katz, not GMX, not any mail.
Your job is to encrypt your mail body and to use encrypted
end protocols. And hopefully to choose providers that use TLS
to talk to the providers of your correspondants so that the
non-body parts are encrypted on the transit wire as well.
Of course you can always ask admin at tormail.org to tell
you who they are and what their policy and character and
threat model are. Lol.
I believe current thinking is that though some of their
servers reside in the US, the operators are not of original
US origin.

I've noticed that many web forums deny creation of new forum accounts

mailinator, etc. This makes me think the forum software includes
in its popular distribution a list of these known maildrops?
I've also noticed major social sites denying these maildrops as
And in some rare cases (though I failed to keep notes) I've seen
some sites denying Yahoo and even Gmail because they are free.
Although this is only partially related to Tor, I wanted to survey
peoples experiences with denials keyed to attempted use of particular
mail service providers. What are the trends or characteristics here?
So called disposable maildrops are a special case that more sites
tend to refuse (for no real reason given that many full yet free
mail services exist).
I'm more interested in experiences with regular full (IMAP/POP/SMTP/HTTP)
yet free mail services being denied? And if that denial varies based
on the perceived (presumably as seen by the target site's management)
size, glamour, professionalism, security, catered user base, or
obscurity of the mail service you attempted to use?
Note: I'm not referring to signing up for the mail service itself,
we know that is commonly blocked. But about using certain domains at your site of interest.

Being presumed anons on the backend too, I would doubt their records
at the registrar are in compliance with ICANN regulations. But when
faced with loss of domain anyways, taking a fight there via your

So let's see, if I down my service, shuffle some things around, and

I can see a siteA or adnet recognizing a unique is visiting them by
watching your ad pulling profile, especially if you customized it.
I can see adnet maybe knowing you're the same user on siteA and siteB.
I can maybe even see siteA knowing you're the same user on siteB if
the sites share intel with adnet.
I can see an exit knowing these things through similar active/passive
means that the adnets might use.
I think these four are all possible right?
In practice guess is that people would be more at risk of tracking
by not being session careful and using ctrl-shift-del-everything [1].
But in any case, I thought the purpose of TBB was to end
torbutton in conjunction with FF ESR releases to have the
resource to make the changes to FF that Mozilla was not willing,
or delays in, doing... and to do it in the one place where they would
seem to natively belong, the browser, rather than torbutton.
And to send those changes back upstream to Mozilla.
I did not get the sense TBB was to do that for addons.
Given that the fingerprinting being covered in this thread
still doesn't give away your real identity unless you chose
to provide it to one of the sites/adnets, back to the original
People use these plugins because they:
- Hate ads
- On Tor, it is often more than just noticeably faster. Not just
in reducing bandwidth and connections,  but in page rendering
timeouts and incomplete pages when adservers don't respond.
- May even make you less trackable by not ingesting so
many cross-site cookies in the first place.
For many people, those benefits outweigh the talked about risks.
So install them if you like. But I don't think it's right to ask
torproject to install the plugin of the day as a convenience factor.
Or to maintain its own version of a plugin unless its vulnerabilities
are at least as high as its demand, and the upstream won't fix it.
[1] TBB could get rid of the annoying 'OK' prompt in the pop up
for that, thus going back to the old immediate way it took effect
in the past. Some sort of status bar flash when the clearing

They may use some other suggested approaches instead...
- Simply deleting the offending account
- Implementing statistical sinks (dspam, crm114, markov, etc) with bounce
notification if the destination is unseen (like with email...
mail you send is assumed to make it to  personal filter
or be bounced, not be silently sunk by your provider before it makes the
internet hop to  or by  provider without filing it
in a spam folder for - Community moderation
- Delayed registration
- Captcha
Email, sure the background data load is high in relation to human count.
Forum spam is more annoying since the above filters are rare, but absent
a crapflood, the data traffic underlying it is relatively negligible.
Again, it's probably more interesting to analyze the actions or notice
sites take in relation to smaller full yet free email services than the
more known ones like gmail/yahoo/hotmail or mailinator or tormail
type cases.

But still, in the absence of other similar traffic, if you originate

Regarding RFC1918 observations...
ISP's with clue are supposed to do reverse path filtering on
their customer connections (src), and not route 1918 space
beyond their borders (dst).
It is more likely to see 1918 space in src addresses on the net
because some ISP somewhere forgot RPF.
And common to see 1918 in dst addresses if you're hosted
in some amateur datacenter that hasn't figured out VLAN's.
Most ISP's and transits with clue block it all as well as
a bunch of other nonsensical bogons.
Just block all inbound 1918 packets (whether it's in src and/or dst),
and everything not addressed to you via the wan interface.
And make sure you're not leaking your own 1918 space to
your provider.
Special care of your modem/bridge management and any dhcp
may be needed.
It's still encrypted traffic, not plaintext. Your cable/dsl operator AS
has no interest in being a passive adversary itself. Though it may
partner with an actual PA who can see beyond just that AS anyways.

When trying to fetch about 50 onions at a time, Tor eats up all of
a P4 1.8GHz CPU. And only about a tenth of the HTTP requests that

Further, using Tor as an exit (whether via polipo or SOCKS) also
becomes less than useful.
I'm not seeing any kernel, Tor, or polipo errors.
Polipo uses: clientTimeout=380 serverIdleTimeout=360 serverTimeout=360.
Bandwidth is around 200k and not a problem.
Wget uses: -t 0 --retry-connrefused --max-redirect 0.
Wget does return these log counts across a couple thousand unique onions:

I'm not sure yet whether it's the parallelism, lack of CPU, or
something else that's causing it (I don't have enough free CPU to
test higher levels of parallelism).
Overall, it seems Tor acts unreliably when loaded down with hidden
service requests. Whereas with TCP over a loaded internet or CPU,
you normally get connections and data, just more slowly. This
behavior with Tor could very easily impact chatty mesh services
that people might want to deploy on onions. Ideas?
(I didn't test whether the same thing happens with paralellizing
clearnet sites via Tor's exit feature. Or with tons of parallel
connections to just a few onions.)

@_subject: [tor-talk] SocksPort: Circuit isolation is not Exit isolation 
I noticed this when trying multiple SocksPort's. I ended up with
the following circuits, listed in order of command invocation:
port 8051 circ 35 nodes R1 R2 E1
port 8052 circ 34 nodes R3 R4 R5 E1
Note the same exit was selected.
Also, the second circuit was longer.
I don't think either of these two things are counter documented as
a function of socksport. Just posting it as observed for anyone
thinking multiple socks ports provide exit isolation when going to
the same destination . And for the extra hop thing.
AFAIK, to achieve exit isolation, instead of a single tor with
multiple socksports, you need to run multiple tor's with chosen
exit maps to that dest . If you run tor's but don't map
them, weighted chance will eventually cause simultaneous use of the
same exit. If you map them, you don't get the potentially desirable
traveler effect over time.
The typical use case is wanting to use multiple accounts on the
same site at once, with a guarantee that you're not appearing to
be from the same exit and thus are not as easily linked.
The guarantee would only apply across a single tor instance. And it
would require proper configuration and use of apps across socksports.
The ticket below relates to exit isolation, but in the context of
newnym, not socksport. The round robin bucketing aspect would be
useful under both.

I think that if I was watching the site logs and userA and userB
continually logged in daily at about the same times from the same
exit, I might infer them to be the same user. I might not even be

I get most of the protocol.
Though I might agree, more perhaps from the humor aspect :) We all
know telling users not to do something, that is at least marginally
possible, doesn't work. Lots of apps are going to have many connections
going up and down. Chat/mail networks, the new P2P social nets,
search and archive engines, network stats, even filesharing/torrenting.
Anything that has a distributed model will be doing some or all
parts of the HS setup and transit. Even a popular onion site has
to create piles of outbound circuits to service demand. Saying
"Don't do it" would be putting the heads in the sand.
Anyway, I posted one particular usage pattern earlier. I can get a
steady pool of about 15-20 going before the local CPU bogs down.

Yes I see that analysis clear for the pure anon account, 1/N, situation :)
It seemed that with some non pure anon parameters/patterns that
isolating exit might be better than using the 1/N odds. Currently Tor
exit is also not near to 1/N selection odds.
If I am jane.red1 jane.red2 and jane.red3 all with Mac browser

@_subject: [tor-talk] One answer to the bittorrent problem . . .? 
Although I don't speak for Tor, allow me to summarize...
- Tor is a transport only. As a matter of both policy and law, and because
all data along the hops is encrypted anyways by design... it has no ability
to and will not be modifying any data in transit even if it could.
- Tor has no plans to write or bundle app specific shims in the package.
- Changing the addresses or accounts in apps to gibberish will
obviously break those apps.
- So long as the user sets it up properly, torrenting is both possible
and safe already. You don't need a "communicator" shim. How to do
that is up to the user to learn and Tor won't tell because it doesn't want
the traffic. And even if the user does manage to set it up, it will be a poor
user experience since inbound connections are not possible with Tor
and fully meshed and optimal P2P requires them.
- Tor may eventually add the ability to bind a socket at the exit.
- Those who still insist on running torrent need to recognize the
load their actions place on the Tor network and pay it back. Some
estimate the cost to be roughly 7-8 times what you use. The average
home connection doesn't have enough bandwidth to support that.
And even if it did, the user would then have to learn to set up a relay.
Assuming the majority of torrenter's wish to engage in copyright
violation, they're not going to be very happy with the week (or four)
it takes that same connection to transfer a DVD-9. So forget using
Tor for torrenting and just buy yourself a legit VPN connection in a
foreign country and enjoy.

"permanent-id" is the permanent identifier of the hidden service,
consisting of 80 bits. It can be calculated by computing the hash value
of the public hidden service key and truncating after the first 80 bits:
 permanent-id = H(public-key)[:10]
To run a hidden service, Tor generates an  RSA-1024 keypair. The .onion
name is computed as follows: first the  SHA1 hash of the  DER-encoded
ASN.1 public key is calculated. Afterwards the first half of the hash is
encoded to  Base32 and the suffix ".onion" is added.
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

@_subject: [tor-talk] SocksPort: Circuit isolation is not Exit isolation 
Update: My nutty fruit bat now tells me I had 'trackhostexits .'
turned on in the original example. I think that explains the growth
of the matching exit (4th node) onto the second circuit.
Without that I get (with SessionGroup as default)...
r1 r2 r3
r4 r5 r6
r1 r2 r3
r4 r1 r5
r1 r2 r3
r1 r4 r5
r1 r2 r5  I wasn't able to reproduce another 'same exits' case
r3 r4 r5   during the test period.
So two calls to the same  over different socksport
do not traverse the same identical node path from entry to exit.
But some partial relay or exit reuse is possible. Maybe even up to
reusing all the same relays but in a different order?
The man page speaks of streams (TCP) sharing circuits. Not sure if
there can be multiple circuits using the same relay path (ATM VC's),
or if each path carries just its own circuit or stream. Isn't there
some artwork somewhere on Torproject? I'll look for it.
It would be nice to have trackhostexits optional per socksport.
And to have newnym and mapaddress applicable per port. The idea
being to have one daemon serve most needs.
 Regarding exit isolation across socks ports (ExitSessionGroup?)...
Before digressing into valid yet tangential stats theory, this was
the problem statement at hand. And currently, using multiple Tor's
(whether mapaddressed or even just left to drift) seems to be the
best available way to do that.
This paper is readable. The usernames I was thinking of (but not
described in this thread) would not match their classifier but might
trigger a human classifier.
Given the estimated 450k Tor users all accessing whatever their
sites of the day are, the simple use of Tor alone will likely not
yield that conclusion.
It just seems like a useful option for users wishing to manage that
part of their own known usage pattern. Anyways.

Tor2Web isn't crawling anything, thus they have no need or obligation

Nobody in their right mind is going to crawl and index 5 sites and then
ask all 100 sites linked to from those pages for their robots.txt before
listing those 100 links. That's not how things are done on the net.
Depending on your vantage point, crawling the subject site isn't
necessarily required to index it.
And if a site is so concerned about someone else publishing a link,
however obtained, then they should name it something innocent and
password protect it or use better operational security to begin with.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and P2P 
Allow me to combine some quotes from this recent thread alone...
It seems pretty clear we are at the point where there are current
and growing ideas and demand for all manner of anonymous P2P services.
In part driven by global news, and thus global awareness, that
governments, business and others have questionable regard for
privacy, etc.
And if consumers continue to demand and drive openness into products,
there will soon come a day when open, BSD/Linux capable, pad devices
(PC + wifi + cell) the size of a DVD case are common. Demand,
compounded by utility.
Regardless of the capacity for the sort of projects listed below
to handle it, people WILL build these services. Some of them are
out there today, and being largely unknown, they are performing
well enough. More users will try them and adopt them based on need,
utility and performance. The only question is how will the networks
perform at each stage of popularity.
Given that these services are surely coming in force... and from
directions that see these networks more as a raw transport than
say, primarily for the purposes outlined on their respective web
pages... it seems the usual echo of "we're a nice project, don't
do that, too much load" may not be useful. This should not imply
fault, but merely suggest that it's dated and hopeless.
And since the networks are anonymous, countermeasures would affect
all users matching the metric, even those using it for said purposes.
So maybe there's room for more focused/funded research into the
actual impacts of different traffic models (leading to proper
resource giveback by apps/users/groups), development improvement
in the networks to handle the traffic, even up to creating an
entirely new anonymous network optimized for P2P ...
... before this certainty happens.
Do what is needed to go forth and conquer :)
P2P services should look at the current strong anonymization projects
that could provide transport. The ones I know of are:
More links are welcome.
People should not make the mistake of assuming they can freely use
any network without negative impact. Including fatal impact for
their own service. They should offer sufficient resources back to
the network. Contrary to popular belief, P2P is not a free ride.
Relay, directory and index is expensive and the cost is bandwidth,
CPU and storage.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and P2P 
Is, or can Tor be, useful or optimal? On which platforms? With what
P2P apps or traffic patterns?
Assuming these are the only cores available at this time...
Running a P2P app will require running one of the above cores. Which
means all peers already have access to each core's internal addressing
scheme, respectively: i2p, private IPv6, onion. And thus they have access
to each other.
So though Tor is unique in having exit facilities by design, those
facilities are not needed for a global P2P mesh to work.
Tor's uniqueness and its perhaps as yet uncharacterized ability to
handle certain P2P loads should lead to a comparative review of the
utility of other cores.
If you can speak IPv6, you can speak Phantom, which makes app
development incredibly simple. Written in C. Probably the lightest
weight core so far. Needs some review. Presents a native, node
specific, source address.
I2P has the most network experience so far with lots of P2P connections
going on, ala bittorrent. More work is needed to interface apps
with it. Written in Java. Does not present a native, node specific,
source address?
If you need to use exit for other things, you may not have room to
run multiple cores, provide some resources back, etc. So Tor would
make sense in that case. Does not present a native, node specific,
source address.
There are certainly more comparisons to be made.
It does provide an IPv6 interface/layer, that is definitely a win since
you can use all the usual network programming methods and apps.
It is not a P2P app, only a shim for Tor and I2P. And it needs
further work to provide IPv6 to HS/I2P PKI authentication. I might
be inclined to sign all the traffic ala IPSEC before attempting
some ping pong scheme.
On a big scale, it might make sense for all the anonymous networks
to use interfaces and IPv6 node addresses for interop purposes.
Though there are some current problems there... Tor's 80 bits may
be too small, I2P's 256 is wider than can be packed under an IPv6/48.

If you're expecting to be doing lots of session initiation, I think
you're going to hit some significant local CPU issues, especially
those of you thinking of P2P applications running on "smaller than
laptop" devices. An occaisional message in the manner in which you
might normally 'text', would work ok. But if you expect to have
some sort of pidgin/sip buddy list full of status and people bouncing
around doing things, it could become ugly. Certainly far worse for
torrenting as the extreme example. And when thousands of people
come online with P2P like that... yeah.
On the other hand, once the session state is up, things seem better
and you're back to the usual latency, bandwidth and reliability
limits of the relay system.
P2P doesn't generally keep sessions up, so it's back to step one.
So it would be interesting to see where this could go.
- Extending circuit and other timeouts for hidden services?
- Storing related TCP or Tor states locally?

They use it a lot for that. Admittedly I really should learn more

When I last looked briefly at this one a couple years back, the
users were not necessarily anonymous to each other. It seemed to
require users to know and/or trust one another. If that was the

these networks remain strong, against seeing the data at a minimum,
it would seem very hard for US-like countries to put them back in
the bottle.
P2P could be anything, the original context was messaging, I think :)
It's a disgusting situation indeed.
Tor has a unique exit feature. Other than being worth leaving Tor
be to preserve that in its own right, other networks have attractive
features for sharing.
There is the parallel universe option... those who like the mechanics
of Tor using the same code but booting into different nodes for the
purpose of running higher bandwidth, large mesh applications. Later on
there could be some design optimizations traded back and forth.
How would this segregate similar looking traffic such as bitcoin
startup and subsequent transactions, a popular hidden site (wiki,
forum, merchant, voice of america streams), etc.
Tor's pretty cool. It's a hard problem. Maybe "don't do that" is right :)

They're not even words, just random obscured letters. You

There are always rational analyses that can be made.
Many analysts think of the available storage and compute
power in a facility such as that (100ksqft 65MW public initial)
in terms of the common commercial datacenter filled with commodity
compute gear... dell servers, seagate drives, ati gpus, cisco net, etc.
'Google big/smart corp style' if you will. That's certainly a lot of it.
But what few seem to consider is custom hardware and the big
budget picture which you can search for pretty pictures of. And black
secrets. So perhaps some higher storage density tech... gates as
disk, optical, etc. And definitely mountains of custom ASICs. People
know about deepcrack and bitcoin asics and Intel's smallest fabs...
well how much of that can you tape out and power on that kind
of budget... ? Lots. Now factor in 10-25-?? percent ahead via
black tech.
It seems safe to assume some properly implemented yet
smaller keylength algos may be at risk. And essentially
certain that all manner of network and data analysis is
possible limited only by the programming brains and
scale to do it.
As for Tor, 1024bit equivalence may be a bit low. Most
of the cost is in key exchange/setup, not the stream itself.
Run 'openssl speed' to see that. End user machines could handle
4096, but the relays and HS are a question. It's not crunchtime yet
but maybe getting closer. See also keylength.org, and the various
crypto and risks lists.
Maybe Tor's TCP streams are a weak point in timing and network
analysis. There's probably some anonbib about splitting up
the traffic across UDP paths for reassembly on the far side.
And even that's still subject to analysis.
What real limits are there to their 'partnership' with telecoms?
A telecom may want legal ability to feed them everything.
But what is the penalty for not? The courts will not liquidate a
telecom no matter how gross their constitutional infraction under
the cover and 'authorization' of the executive and even legislative.
Worst case for them is a senate show hearing, they get censured,
a token fine, some heads roll and life goes on.
Same for unauthorized taps... you know about Glomar and other
deep sea fun right. Lots of vacuuming going on out there. No real
penalties apply other than the oopsies of political embarrasment
and a turn through the revolving door.
What about US torture going to the Hague, any number of things
around the world lately, not much penalty there, so none here either.
It's reasonable that determining who is talking to who, given
those endpoints (the who's) that fall entirely within the network
one can see and process at this scale, is relatively easy.
Especially for anything regular, outstanding, or that can be
Hidden services definitely fall under the latter. They either don't
have them within network yet, or they're on about bigger/secret
fish and don't care to shut them down. Drugs, murder, crime and
cp... all traditional LEA areas, will nearly always take a back
seat to [inter]national intrigue. They're also not 1980's CIA narco
scale, so there they may remain.
Indeed. And no.
If Tor and similar systems, Bitcoin, and whatever else are still around
and canary free by 2020, they're either incredibly strong, up against
clueless adversaries, or just riding unawares and high in the back seat
while the driver in a black suit grins doing 88mph :)

The US does now disclose the aggregate budgets for DoD, DHS, and
intel services under which NSA falls as a non line item. A search will
yield analyst estimates of the actual black amounts, etc. There's even
big wall posters for it all. No budget can exceed taxes plus international
revenues, various debt facilities and minus known expenses. It's not
Moonshot or war scale, nobody can afford that anymore without a
complete overhaul.
Yet a chip fab and unspottable underground facilities are entirely within
current means. To wit, The Mountain, Raven Rock, Utah DC, defuncts
such as Yucca, SSC, and so on. And implementing known attacks via
ASIC's where useful is common best practice these days.
It comes down to cost/benefit, business and rational guess. Figure out
where the state of the art lies (both commercial and estimates of advanced
black tech) for the budget, megawatts, floor space, die size, storage,
bandwidth, algorithms, attacks, hiring and education programs, history,
bit and clock efficiences, problems to solve, goals, etc. Within that answer
is where you will find the truth. At least as to capability, if not execution.
History shows there are always a few lucky gaping advances out there in
the world when compared to commercial tech. Whether the current ones
apply to anything people here care about is unknown. And unless you're
somehow an actor in that same high intrigue, you don't have anything to
worry about on an individual personal level [1] beyond the global and
national ramifications of it all.

They're based in San Francisco, along with Craigslist (which

I'd bet there is room for some one day presentations in the big

and invite them.
I seem to be denied with them, but that could be the apparrent
effect of a stern rate limit. So I need to do better and copy the
message/screens to the list. I often give up though.
Tor is already slow. So though silly, a rate limit is probably better
than a universal Tor block.
My main issue with sites that are Tor aware and then take action
against Tor nodes specifically, is that most seem to say
they get attacks, spam, illegal stuff from Tor. While true, that
is a drop in the pond when compared to from the internet at large.
Yet they don't block the internet, the coffee shops, the cable
ranges, Romania, etc. It's the being dumb about the net and the
kneejerk and the push to privacy destroying phone based auth.
Hopefully with some group talks maybe some good will happen.

Of course it isn't imaginary. However this is where kneejerkers are
just being dumb... 2^8 exits will *never* ever be anything in comparison
to the 2^30 IP's reasonably estimated to be actually in use. Ten
square kilo's of your favorite big city has more abusable open IP's
than 2^8. Know how many big cities there are? Know how many
laptops and wifi and open wallplates there are? Lots.
Though sure, I do suggest and accept that Tor may present a
different *class* of abuse than other categories of abusable
I think cost is large what they think about. Just a...  'Really? You mean we
can turn a flag and whack 2^8 at zero cost, sweet, we just eliminated a
help desk drone's worth of salary from our costs'. That's pretty cold.
Nyms wouldn't be usable by legitimate anons unless they are
free from linkable properties. Whether it's usage and cookies across
sites, or back to the anon themself. Even then you must trust the third
party nym provider with the nym logs. History proves that trust is always
misplaced and broken.
On the other hand, a little development cost by a site can put up some
pretty big walls against abuse in the form of time delayed accounts,
captchas now and then, good filters on your i/o, etc. And often cost
less than whatever service you pay to keep you 'safe'.
And honestly, if you're so fucking tight that you can't pony up for
a proper abuse desk, then both your business model and you
should expect failure.
The only thing that can truly and properly solve a human problem
is humans, not robots. That is a lot of what Tor is all about, solving
problems. Those who would blindly swat Tor down are part of the

Let's take bitcoin for a sales example. There are lots of people who would
like to find a site that would actually take the sale. Some of those people
have needs to trade from work, or school, or to keep their ISP from
giving away their profile... Tor does that. So these sites are LOSING
business, lots of it, because they're being stupid about where someone
*appears* to be coming from and/or whatever else they see from there.
I don't know what business school they went to, but in my book you take
the sale and stay out of the privates of your customer.
And right now there is no law anywhere in the world that says you
cannot do business with customer merely for being via Tor. And only a
couple situations with banned countries and known agents lists. All
of which are addressible by KYC, if you are so regulated, to again
permit you to accept business from wherever. With bitcoin, or even
any other type of business, actual regulation which you MUST
follow by law often doesn't exist... only 'guidance' and broadly applied
best practice.
Within that realm of always being legal... there is thin and rich with
happy customers, all the way to broad and poor with a reputation
that minus1's you.
I think Amazon takes the sale via Tor :) Hats off to Jeff.

I don't mind this approach too much. At least it leaves
some room for legitimate users to find exits. Restores
the state to open after some time. And is a bit more mature
tool in that, if you don't have accounts (which is better to
block by if you do), it's the next best way to terminate a
problem in realtime. Though I don't think I'd apply a
permaban, because whatever IP is bothering you will
eventually get pulled at the source before long. Unless their
profits come from spam, bribing Russian officials with cracked
CC's, etc.
I suppose it's possible they do as well. Just that as with any
userbase, knowing the effective range of their IP's may be hard.
On the other hand, maybe they do block RO indiscriminately
because they believe it to be a compellingly overwhelming
source of trouble, or simply unfathomable, from their perspective,
that a legitimate user would come from there.
For example, a year or so ago I tested an English language based
predominantly North American, slightly Euro, dating site against Tor.
Though they had no stated policy to be sure of it, from my tests it appeared
that from English speaking exit countries, Tor worked fine. If I let Tor float
or come in via say Brazil, the account would be silently deleted. This
lead to belief that they utilized the 'unfathomable' policy. Again, their
actual policy is unknown, I could have just been using unlucky IP's.
Either way, I'd very much hesitate to recommend them to Tor users who
would fear for their legitimate account, and thus any developing relations,
against that unknown. Further, people find dating hard enough without having
their employer or landlord snooping on how many kids they want, and whoever
else generally reading/storing/selling their personal bits. These sites need
to respect that. Part of which is to fully and properly enable HTTPS on
their servers and to permit their users to come from Tor.

The skill needed for the masses to download and use Tor for personal
style abuse is far less than for them to have formerly attempted old
school proxy chains. Would not an analysis of the type of misdeeds
carried out via all the various abuseable sources yield at least measurable,
if not substantial, weightings for each class of source towards particular
classes of misdeeds. Finance/deep crackers use some subsets, packet
scanners and flooders some others, data leeches others.
Many of us have hats in both places. I've seen places where
IP based whack a mole was phrased pretty much that exact way.
Or as 'sweet, now we don't even have to perform the balancing act.'
We're all free to debate each other, point out this or that, supply
links and so forth. That's all good :) And I even expressed some
rare 'fucking' frustration towards general corporatedom / the state
of affairs regarding the blocking subject.
However the recent direct name calling and abuse amongst
people on this list needs to stop right now.
Yes, it's a hard human problem. One for which I think there
are better solutions than just IP based blocking.
There may indeed be some that are these days. I can't research
and know everything. And if there are, then we can all, as users
and advocates, get them wiki'd and/or suggested out to sites as
Sure, some solutions are archaic and non-adaptive/automated, yet still
better in certain areas than IP blocking. Etcetera also includes shifting the
cost to community moderation, scoring and ranking systems, rollbacks,
warnings/appeals for users, anonymous deposit/forfeiture of token funds,
combined solutions and so on. There are lots of options beyond simple
IP blocking. Particularly on account based systems.
My problem is with simple IP blocking, especially when you take
out an entire shared access system such as Tor with it. It's crude
and takes the ham with the spam. I think the good outweighs the
bad. We're all working for something better :)

Though the wikipedia problem model does apply to other usage scenarios
elsewhere, I did not intend or wish my posts as addressing the
wikipedia subthread but rather the practice of performing just IP
blocking in general.
With the growing knowledge of users regarding their online privacy,
and even interests in having anonymity and communication freedom
options, more are turning to tools like Tor. When their good intents,
participation in, and contributions to services are bluntly blocked
by IP filters, that's a problem.
We're all here because we believe and understand the same basic
If there's one thing this thread illustrates it's that one size
doesn't fit all. Different services have different possible solutions.
As you've noted, reputation (and learning systems in general) are
a powerful tool over time. With the same noted exception regarding
new users... the real world tells us that the first driveby from a
new user bent on trouble may not ever be truly preventable. Yet
input from other users and help desks into a good system can stop
that user rather fast. I hesitate to call any loss an acceptable
one, yet some tolerance from users and sites is necessary. If you
believe the world is good, that will come naturally and not be
entirely unpalatable. In English some people say 'shit happens'
and continue on with their day :)

Not knowing the specific case of wikipedia I might suggest
in general...
If you do not require accounts, and are open to the net at large,
you are fighting a largely unsolvable problem [1]. Learning systems
and community and staff moderation can help there. Yet if your
tolerance is still exceeded, you are best to move to accounts
thereby enabling more powerful solutions.
If you require accounts, invest time in better rollback systems
so that a single click makes the user and their contributions
disappear. Because of the N-way de-merges it may be necessary
as staff to roll it all back to before the bad epoch and notify
your community contributors that 'hey, we had to rollback abuse,
please reapply your bits on such and such pages'. If that community
has since died, others will eventually fill in the loss. The quicker
you are notified the less to roll. Definitely not ideal I know. A wiki is a
rare case of built-upon contribs, whereas other types of services
really can just yank the offending user and their stream out of the
system. Sorry I really don't know WP enough to comment in this
subthread. I like WP though and have never noticed anything offensive
on it so something is working there for that category of abuse :)
[1] For instance, email spam. It is not sucessfully fought with
just IP blocks at all. Only when bayes, markov and other adaptive
intelligience and combined systems came online has spamfighting
kept pace. Maybe now they're enough along that if they turned off
the IP parts they'd still fare acceptably well.
No one minds blocking accounts, after they've proven
to be shitters. I just don't want to deny people beforehand.

Of course... other than following the letter of law for its own
good, a service is free to do as it wishes. Some services choose
the nanny/block role. Others see value or less legal risk by taking
a hands off position.
I didn't know Russian officials handed out money to services.
Time to start some services in Russia :)
Some of them even have that as their advertised featureset, as their
paid/unpaid contract with their users, all this fully within
applicable law.
And here we are alongside EFF and many others fighting for those
same services, open wifi and other's right to even exist.
Can anyone imagine a world where users are in control of their own
privacy and data, can speak freely, securely and directly amongst
themselves and can utilize services without undue regard to where
they are, who they are, or who came before?
We're talking about end users using Tor to access services, not
warfare between businesses :)
We'd all say that 'for cause' behaviour may and probably should get
a user of a service cancelled according to the policy of the service.
This particular service had no published policy against using Tor
and no 'for cause' behavior existed. The test account just vanished
without telling. Admittedly I moved to other tasks and did not
bother inquiring.
I disagree with the notion that blocking causes no injury towards
users. The internet may be big, but there are very few truly large
social services on it. Whether we like or admit it or not, those
services are a part of society, even growing as society develops
to the point of being expected and necessary. When they block users
without individual cause, they deny them the right to participate
in that part of society. We may be reaching the point that if I
were a giant US based service and decided to block all of California
because there are some bad people there, I might well be facing a
civil lawsuit, and for good reason. I'd certainly be subject to bad
review, upstart competition and a fleeing userbase. Which might all
seem to nullify my action, but woes for the time lag needed for
that to happen with giant services. During that time, I've caused
injury to a whole swath of people.
Some employers allow use of the net for non-work things. That doesn't
mean a user should trust them, their staff or their non snooping
policy, which if you read it is probably riddled with holes anyways.
Of course if the user doesn't want to invite trouble from their use
they should work within the rules provided to address their needs.
With dating sites, or really, we can broaden this to include any
social service where humans interact and can potentially yield
the various misdeeds as found in society at large...
We all know there are hazards out there, both online and off...
financial, personal, physical, and so on. And some very serious
ones at that. We also now know as individuals a bit about how to
evaluate online risks. And as humans, we have always known pretty
well how to avoid at least physical risks in the real world.
Yes, it's perhaps a bit troubling that some services are very much
hands off. And equally troubling that others nanny/block behind the
scenes, and even avoid educating users about or mentioning risk...
perhaps partly in order to present a field of flowers to naieve
masses so they can market share and otherwise profit from them.
Which one is more wrong? Which service, no matter how well done,
truly matters after the jump to real world? Which one should the
user trust or question... the one that claims to protect them, or
the one that leaves that important business up to them?
Regardless of where a service falls on the policy continuum, it's
not good that some people use tools for bad things. Except for after
the fact, we don't have a good answer for that and never will. I
realize I may be eaten alive by some hungry lunatic today :) Yet I
won't vote for police protectors on every block or hire my own
security force. I balance and accept those risks as my better price
for freedom. Everything is a balancing act and the good has
historically far outweighed the bad. Therefore many of us try to
maintain user's freedom to manage their own affairs, have access
to services large and small (with HTTPS and Tor), and put up with
a little spam in our so found tiramisu :)
Perhaps a good example for those leaning on IP based blocking is
OnionLand's own Hidden Services. Excepting the illegal which clearnet
cannot permit, there are some otherwise legal and successful services
out there in the areas of social, finance, blog, data, hosting and
more. The only transport level blocks available are the equivalent
of user account keys, not IP blocks.

In my experience using Tor, I'm seeing very little in the way of
advanced privacy preserving management schemes. The extant
OpenID/Twitter/FB schemes don't meet that. What I'm currently seeing
the most of is least-cost least-effort IP based blocking. I'm sorry

Sounds like a great place for a wide open exit.. Hey Moritz.. ;)
"permaban .. eventually pulled .. *Unless their profits come from*"
*caveat supplied*
Internet background noise is a hard problem too. So many sources,
so little time to whack them. I'd be tempted to subscribe to a block
service and opt out the Tor IP's as being a moot fraction of that
overall noise and perhaps more user centric than bots or corporate.
The non-targeted noise load doesn't seem much on the screens here.
"They" find unfathomable. Tor testing accounts seemed autodeleted
only from outside the countries/languages catered to (or perhaps
just the profile country). In-country exits did not seem to have a
problem. Unlucky out-country IP's, or shortsighted about their
mobile global citizenry / using Tor at home? As below, cursory
rather than methodical, maybe I'll retest someday.
The data is old, a retest would be needed. Craigslist's more recent
blocking of readers from what really did seem like every exit chanced
upon for a week was much more extensive. Unlucky, or Tor? If they
weren't so far away I'd visit them to ask. Afaik, posting still
doesn't work reliably from Tor, though Torizens can read CL again.
We do now have wildcard FQDN MAPADDRESS which will make testing
things easier. Just waiting on CIDR MAPADDRESS for completeness.
Yeah, I admit it's not very methodical or complete testing yet, and
contact and follow up are definitely lacking due to time constraints.
Actually, and similar to the 'HTTPS Everywhere' and 'Bitcoin.it/Trade'
projects, I think there's a good opportunity for a group to get
together and start a 'Works With Tor' wiki. Listings for categories
of services... news, finance, social, games, IRC, etc. Contact the
services if they don't... that sort of thing.
- Lot of hot button policy things you mentioned, one last note...
We see hands off VPN's, sites, hosts.. in part because, similar to
DMCA / common carrier, touching it can often make you liable. It's
like shoveling and salting your walk. Don't do it and it's just an
'act of God'. But if you do step in and manage it, and something
happens, then you didn't do it properly and you get sued. Similar
happened to someone I knew last winter. Huge payout because they
washed their car, water froze... and well, you know the rest.
I would never trust any dating or social type site, or any online
service for that matter, to protect me and my interests [1],
regardless of whether it's pay or free, or how much data, checking
and exclusion they say they do on other users. They're a business,
not psychics. The majority concern and loyalty of business is to
money... not to my personal individual real world well being.
Look at the Tor website... one of its main, and really great use
cases, is right there on the front page, 'Family & Friends... use
Tor to protect themselves'. Users are learning about the world and
taking independant responsibility for their own well being, in part
because companies, governments and people are failing or abusing
them. Whether running nodes, bug reporting, or talking with people
about Tor, it feels pretty good to be a part of that well being :)
Some of the "we're a safe place" marketing, glossing over and user
moderation going on out there does seem to create some false sense
of security. That causes people's knowledge and natural guard to
drop and then exploits to go up as a result. That's a cause for
[1] I sorta trust my bank even though little interests paid :)
I don't believe it's right to block potential service users, before
they can individually show themselves as spam or ham via some level
of site usage, merely for using Tor. Before that point, they are a
mixed class carrying the Tor banner. If a site wishes to discriminate
against the entire class, that's their thing, we can't stop them,
or convince them with mass appeal, for now. We can only try to
develop better methods together.
Curiously, the EFF suggests that an IP address (perhaps even a
telephone) is not a user and vice versa. And some courts have now
confirmed that suggestion up against complaints that they are
equivalent. How long until the Tor users begin lodging that same
suggestion up against services? ;)
That is because it is a matter of law, not whim.
Blog versus 'hosted commercial seo/scrapers/etc' is essentially
b2b. There are no Tor end users in that picture. It is even more
off topic than other elements of this subthread :)
That is because users and business agree on this. A survey of Tor
users is unlikely to agree with shutting them all out merely for
using Tor.
Books, movies, tools, anything rented... they already handle cash
and accounts, they could very easily maintain a full cash deposit
up to your chosen checkout limit. I did rental once, somewhere
around ten during my time demurred about signing, giving info or
credit. I said ok, gave them John/Jane Does and dropped the cash.
Best repeat customers ever.. serving anonymity with a smile works :)
Some might consider that a social responsibility these days. If
that's part of why some very popular sites have now provisioned and
allow this, that's a good thing.
No, and no thank you!
Among various services... twitters, facebooks, dates, blogs,
forums/lists, wikis... I keep up with a number of them for hobby,
utility, work/personal, fun and so on. My employer has a flexible
work/life policy that permits responsible use of their network. So
be a little more careful before suggesting that I or anyone else
are out here breaking laws and policies, trolling the net, from
their workplace, over Tor, in order to carve up their dates, con
people, adulterate and generally be Dr. Evil ok. That's serious
talk, it's false and it's not appreciated.
If available in the digest, the original Message-Id can be copied
to an In-Reply-To header via a header editing mailer such as Mutt.
Alternatively, supplying the identical 'Subject: CloudFlare' would
allow simple subject threading in the MUA. My own use, in part due
to Gmail, isn't always great either. Using peoples names in the

@_subject: [tor-talk] NPA to urge Internet providers to block users of 
"to voluntarily block communications if an anonymous software
system ... is found abused online."
The second ripline leaves some room but is without specifics.
"The panel specifically recommends that communications be
blocked when there is access from IP addresses publicly listed
as those allocated to the third in a chain of computers that are
used by Tor."
This quote clears that up to be the former. However, it appears
they also intend to ask network operators to block exits as well,
not just websites:
"Based on the recommendations, the National Police Agency to
encourage voluntary efforts such as the industry of Internet
connection operators."
They don't seem to say whether non-exits (thus the EG's among
them) would remain accessible or not.
"The Tor system was utilized by citizens in pro-democracy movements
in the Middle East to escape government suppression, while Wikileaks
also recommends Tor to information providers. The planned access
restrictions are therefore expected to spark a backlash from the industry.
'Communication privacy is our lifeline. We won't be able to accept such
a request,' said an industry insider. An NPA official said, 'We will make
detailed explanations and seek their understanding.'"
"police were summarized for the strengthening of cyber crime
investigation the 'emergency program' ...
According to the National Police Agency, the police has been
promoting public-private partnerships with such Internet-related
companies so far, but pointed out that investigation and not keep up
with the rapid advances in information and communication technology

Emergency program, mentioned considerations and be entrusted to
the private sector, the analysis of the modus operandi of education
and other investigators"
It's a little unclear to what degree these groups are for enforcement
or education, whether they attend public conferences, etc. Likely
the usual mix. There could be some good opportunities there.
Cracking, corp/finance, data theft, copyright that sort of deal is one
thing. But these idiots making death/bomb threats and such are
really getting old not just on its face but due to their tendency to
make the news and piss people off, and against Tor, in a different
sort of way.

What, like genocide? Various parts of the world tried that at various
times in history, it doesn't really work. Neither did the wars on drugs,
terrorism, guns, copyright or any other attempt in history to stamp
whatever it was they tried to stamp out... out. Very few reached totality.
And those that did did it in the real world, not the virtual one. Giving
society a little time, education and care generally work better.
The directories out there have decent organization... books, forums,
games, markets, media, etc... all generally in their own sections and
clear as to their content. And unless someone's trying to run a scam,
links described as being to blue things don't generally point to green
things. The internet is full of links, no need to click them or venture into
dark corners. Start your own link list full of the blue things you do like.
Grow your own blue spaces. Counsel others to come to you. Move
the overall review even farther from the bad by marketsharing the good.
If you have an issue with or designs on OnionLand, you need to take
it up in discussions there.
It's certainly possible to try crusading against such things. And
depending on what it is you are crusading against, there will surely
be plenty of supporters out there and here cheering you on. There
are also cases and places where your simply clicking through
a link during the course of such activities could get you in trouble.
Or the activities could be viewed as censorship, abuse, TOS
violation, and so on in their own right... all potentially trouble for you.
Whatever may be, realize that anonymous networks exist in order to
provide a strong defense against any censorship. If you hate green
things and some other people like them, there's not much you can do.
In fact, any such efforts might fail as the greenies may move farther
underground. The greenies are still there doing their thing, you just
don't see them. Instead of trying to bury them deeper you might be
better off leaving them visible for the real professionals to address.
Another interesting property of anonymous networks is that they
exist for you too. If you try to stamp them out or silence others
on them... where will those networks be when the day comes
that you might need them the most or wish your voice to be heard?
Nobody likes seeing these things. Using Tor for good to solve
the underlying human problems will have far more positive and
long lasting effects than wasting your time in edit wars.

Beyond number, having data such as the name is useful for other

Perhaps by another private third? v2 happened before real v0

Diversity is hard to verify, we have no web of trust amongst

any undue confidence there beyond self confidence.
Also, afaik the family attribute doesn't apply to HSDir operations,

Gmail seems intent on refusing signups via Tor without
supplying other linkable and not rationally expendable
data such as phone. I expect they'll bleed off users who
need this to other providers through attrition, and incur
negative publicity from prospective new users for failing
to support it in these days.
There were a few threads over on tor-talk in which a

the google claims, not sure where that went.
Amongst your convinceable and tutorable peers, yes
of course. Amongst the rest of the world..
..I don't agree. It will be a long time before anything
replaces traditional email worldwide. Until then traditional
email services do need to be out there... accessible via
Tor and free / donation based for basic messaging use.
Independant mail nodes can work if done well, that's
essentially what TorMail, Lavabit, SC, Hush, etc are.
And though you may encrypt the body, there are uses
for which you don't want to (non crypto peers). Know
the weaknesses, your tools, and pick the right one for
the right use. TorMail was in some sense the most
interesting thing since the mail mixes. And other services
that try to do crypto for you, can't, it's impossible hype.
Better to continue building OpenPGP etc into traditional
mail clients smoother.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Basics of secure email platform 
Within the existing email standards and limitations the world uses today...
Mail services cannot guarantee this, only the user can, and every service
that tries to take/manage responsibility for the user's cleartext body is
both lying and a failure waiting to happen. The user cannot trust any code
provided by the service or give any secret key material/access to the service.
They must encrypt on their own locally with OpenGPG, EnigMail etc and
then insert the output into the mail transport.
The only thing a mail provider can do is apply privacy centered systems
best practice. Logs, crypted transport, access, location, policies, peering
with other mail services, etc. Because almost no one does this, there is
lots of room for new providers to get these basic things right. And the
demand for it just went up.
If you get that right, and if the user encrypts, then only the delivery metadata
remains as unfixable. Unless you hold a kill switch and burn the spool keys
when things get spooky.
We don't know enough about the case to say yet what it was or wasn't
'enough' to be up against.
We do know the system required the user to trust the service with key
material (passphrase), which yields failure every time.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Replacement for Tormail 
I believe this better said as 'traditional email', since that may also
use 'secure' tls transports or OpenPGP by users with no change.
The idea of tormail was that they were not subject to legal process.
Their proxy points into and out of the real world were. But it is yet
untested whether in some places one can shut such an entire point
down due to not being able to service a specific account. A curious
mix of contract, common carrier, free speech, jurisdiction and so on.
You may 'have an idea' who EFF or any other entity or jurisdiction
is, but they are all subject to certain specific things. Those are very
good fights to have and expose as well.
And regardless of service model and who runs it, all public points
are subject to tapping in the nearest upstream, no gain there.
Some people did note tormail had a domain locked and
supposedly got it back. And maybe they did move proxy
servers sometimes too.
They did have service issues and were not exactly mature/open
but does that imply lack of trust? Who knows. 'Knowing them'
should not imply trust either. That's why there is OpenPGP and
other messaging protocols too.
With standard email, I'd feel better with lots of little providers
around the world, not just the big three. Ones that try these
things. That way you could watch and see who does and says
what up against what and all sorts of models could be tested.
Right now most of the small market are legacy providers in
this respect, notice how many still do not provide TLS and
privacy oriented policies. Huge oppurtunities here.
Besides, EFF and Tor are not in the business of running
physical services carrying user data, much less storing
it between transit. Ask torservers, noisebridge or start your
own group :)
I do not like this 'leak'. SMTP header and operation is what it is
by exact design, not by leaky bug. If MUA put the content of your
disk into mail that would be a leak. User is 'unmasked' not
by SMTP, but by their [improper or choiced] use of it.
You would be surprised how much a random tech fly can do. A fly that
is given help with the legal/finance aspect becomes a powerful raptor.

The linux packet filter should be able to log traffic by user

some other way and use tcpdump or wireshark.
You said that in effect, whatever system you're using skype
from... is using, or is behind, the ip of an exit node you
run. And that skype blocks your ip (tor nodes). So there's nothing
you can do but find another ip to run one of the two from since
a service like skype is more likely to block from geoip a1 or
tor consensus than counting users it sees multiplexing to it over
your ip as ways to tell an ip is a tor node to block.
You also said 'eventually' which may mean your ip is
dynamic, or you're running skype behind a tor client
and are experiencing normal roving at the end of your
three hop tunnel.
Skype may be prevalent, but it is now proven untrustworthy
in regards to content monitoring.

@_subject: [tor-talk] About time to make BitTorrent work over Tor, 
Technically, Bittorrent works fine when run completely inside Tor.
The resources needed at the client are reasonable (ie: cpu).
The bandwidth is currently reasonably available. And onions are
secure enough for people who insist on skirting copyright. That
alone makes me wonder why Tor hasn't grown any long lived
torrent clouds. Probably because the entry bar is high and the
slower speed is beyond the scope of the typical leeching
What people should know is that Tor currently can't handle it at
scale in at least two areas...
Transferring 1MiB causes about 7MiB worth of reduction in Tor
bandwidth, plus the CPU and state for processing the circuits.
You can get that back by running relays, but the vast bulk of the
above users probably won't be willing or bothered to do that, let
alone be able to figure out how to do it right and in conjunction
with their BT app. So Tor is likely to tank from that alone.
Then assuming they did run relays, the last part is dealing with
N million users worth of relay and onion descriptors. That takes
out more bandwidth, the dirservers, and everyone's local cpu
and ram.
For those reasons, it's hard to truly push mass use of p2p over
Tor. Yet I think given the greater probability of a p2p influx as
time goes on [1], Tor really should have some prepared design
considerations on the table beyond "please don't do that",
which torrenters obviously ignore. Hopefully designs can be
found that aren't restrictive.
[1] Pick any hot p2p app, drop N million users worth on Tor. In
this thread it's BT... being driven slowly towards anonymous
systems by the anti's [today, Russian blocking], enhanced
by piratebrowser giving hints to millions of users "Hey, what's

@_subject: [tor-talk] About time to make BitTorrent work over Tor, 
Tor does not currently scale as simply as that. Therefore whatever
you try to scale on top of Tor will not scale either. All using exits will
do (roughly speaking) is cause Tor to fail 1/2 as fast as using the
purely internal approach would. BT is further badly hampered since
UDP and inbound bindings are unavailable under the current exit model.
Tor's design is generally "move a lot of browsers over a few exits",
anything else is bonus, at least historically. At the moment, if you're
trying to move to millions of p2p users, not just hundreds of tinkerers,
you're better off enhancing Tor first or writing or finding another secure
transport that scales better. Then moving it all off the clearnet once and
for all. But that appears to be beyond the typical scope of thinking in the
BT space, you know, because it's not fast and it's sooo harrrddddd man.
Tor is good stuff, but like anything else, only good when used within
its model. Supposedly i2p welcomes torrenting. Millions? Ask i2p.

it begins failing to perform as advertised, someone's going to call it out
in a technical fashion in mail, in papers, in a conference talk... and it
will be forked, or abandoned, or defunded and pitchforked by the donors
and users who have been conned. That con's really hard to pull off
and risky when most of the people involved are out in the open. As
such, Tor doesn't deny or gloss over design limitations, lack of fitness
for particular adverse scenarios, or its roadmap beyond the time
needed to create decent papers or mail out blurbs about them.
Money is given for people to do something useful with it.
I don't think it matters where the money comes from or
whether it's directed, so long as the product is in the
open for evaluation and choice. And that there's some
reasonable accounting as to how the total input was spent and
that it matches up with results observed in the output product.
Trolling on about this is just a stupid waste of time.
Tor is useful and I have no problem with the Tor project.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Many more Tor users in the past week? 
If it's real users electing to install whatever, that's potentially
bad news (eg: the current relay issues) because that user
choice isn't going to go away.
Though if it's due to being embedded in bots, a badly coordinated
research project, or an attack, those three cases tend be found
out and go away in time, which is good. But they're repeatable,
which isn't good.
So right now it appears we're at 1M new users or about
2.5-3.0+ times prior steady state (in about a week and a half).
But are we? The verbage on these graphs talks of:
- request counts to select non-authority directory mirrors (users page)
- bytes rolling off the directory relays (network page)
Are these requests keyed to and counted towards unique clients
whether by ip or pki? Or is it possible a handful of 'clients' are
anonymously banging away at the dirs over Tor for fun making
it appear this way? I'll guess not due to the country data
being in the former page. Also, the former says 'refresh ... on a
regular basis', so we're not treating a sped up client as more
clients are we? I'll guess not because that would be a d-oh
# dirbytes
"The following graph shows total written and read bytes as
well as written and read dir bytes."
No, there are not these four stated graph traces there, only
the latter two.

reasonable single user contactable domain, mail them and
say "hi, we're tor, what are you using"? It's offendably tracky,

Ok, thanks, I bcc'd this your way.
We didn't see the breakout till the 19th. Which is the week after
 'shipping started on the 10th with most downloads during the first
  week'.
Depending upon the number of users adopting PirateBrowser and turning
into daily running users, it seems we would have seen at least some
permanent bump before the 19th, but we don't.
And even if 100% of the quoted downloads cut spontaneously over to
full time users a week later, that's only half our current 1M growth.
Though  the '550000 installs' may only count webinstalls, not other
sources. And by then user's copy could have come from anywhere,
including the two obvious torrents [1]. Currently, the torrent cloud
for v0.6b has around 3.0-5.5k seeds depending on the tracker. I
didn't check ver0.5b.
If the PirateBrowser folks somehow track and can forward a 'currently
online' count that would be helpful to subtract from Tor's apparent
1M new continuous users.

provider that has this charity policy, cancels an account, and then

It seems that at any given time and for various purposes Tor has
some TCP connections open to various places. Now if you rip
your IP out from under that with DHCP, etc... Tor, and even the
TCP stack itself, is going to in some cases attempt retransmits
and things when the new IP comes up. There will be TCP state,
sequence numbers, etc following you around till the stale connections
eventually die off. There certainly isn't any use to that behavior.
Seems to me that Tor should have a controller command that
tells Tor to close down all connections, another to confirm things
are closed (instead of waiting for possible indefinite return on the
first), and then hibernate till awakened by a complimentary command.
Users could wrap these around DHCP or whatever change mechanism
they have.
Of course none of this worthwhile if killing and restarting Tor is of no
real loss to Tor performance, such as cached Tor data which will
eventually be reobtaint from the network.

On the other hand, I'm sure TPO is doing it almost entirely in an

against evil wares. As opposed to doing it so TPO can just squat
on their own name for grins. And that TPO lawyers serve at the
direction of a reasonably well clued and rational board.
As to 'safety', note that Tor says Tor itself is 'potentially unsafe
software, beta, etc'. Which is lent out, among other things bad
and good, with the name.
There could maybe be some verbage update to the TM FAQ
about 'sure, so long as you're not evil, you can use tor in your name
and leech our graphics'.
But then there's defining evil vs. just crappy shareware/projects.
I had a project that used tor in the name, but renamed it because

Tor is not just 'Tor' but torbirdy, torsocks, exonerator, etc which

With sacrifices, you are giving up those funds forever. You can't
get them back and put them towards a new nym when you decide
it's time to expire the old one. You are in effect paying for an account,
just not necessarily to the account provider. A problem for those
who prefer free services or driving up the cost of advertising.
With nym authorities, these authorities are not going to provide
that authority service for free. Nor are they guaranteed to be free
of bias or influence regarding your nym, or held to performance.
And were it possible to transfer prior authority to a new nym,
you may wish your new nym to be unlinked.

It would be interesting to include a traceroute service in each node
such that path building might take into consideration such IX/AS
repetitions over the proposed full path. Note however that MPLS
routing used to engineer traffic schemes can hide the actual path
from traceroute (though mitigated by its usual use only within one AS).
And other than of geolocation, it's quite hard to align IX nodes with
traceroute data. Last, if the overall src and dst fall within purview of
your tapping GPA of choice the usual timing/counting shortcuts
It would be rather interesting to see if transiting the Tier-1's could
be avoided altogether by pathing circuits through the side peerings
that the lower tiers establish between themselves, as discovered by
said traceroute mechanism. Though that might work within a continent,
don't ever think it will get you between them safely... cable landings
are far too ripe, as is any model where a long haul fiber owner leases
out strands to multiple Tier-n's... that shared bundle terminates
somewhere, and often at many places along the way.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Off topic. What's the extent of the spying 
De-anonymizing does not necessarily mean being
able to read the content, only about establishing
the network. Network analysis is powerful on its own.
But without the content or other metrics it could just be chat
about the weather. Tor encrypts the content traversing its
network even while one or both endpoints become known.
Perhaps the next big leak in a few years will be the status of
agency capabilities against RSA and AES.
The answer as usual is probably a bit of both depending
on how busy things are and the sort of traffic traversing
and what specific is being attacked against.
In regards to finding a client in course of casual browsing...
that seems hard to de-anon. And it seems pretty clear that
hidden services are not as near as immune to locating as
formerly thought... protocol weaknesses exploited by non-PA's,
or simply a PA repeatedly fetching something and watching
their observation net for the pattern... though we have yet to
see any news of either of these being used in the real world.

They do have deanon attack you can read about that take

I find them acceptable performance. Bulk transfers proceed as
expected from least bandwidth available, session setup is ok

This isn't necessarily true. Look at your usage pattern... say you
transfer a 100MiB file. All the adversary has to do is be able to
observe and discriminate out the server and your client, hops don't matter.
One 100MiB transfer, in and out, at the same time, noting also, if needed
to discriminate among endpoints, the start and end times of the transfer
bitrate delta. The only thing that might save you is if one or both ends are
bandwidth saturated within a single multiplexed TCP stream, aka cover
traffic. Tor does not saturate links or always use a single TCP stream. Nor
is your client or the server always busy. This matching is not an easy task,
nor is it known to have been used against anyone, but it is possible.

It would be interesting to see how particular classes of traffic

to see what if any correlation to things that appear in the news...
laws, elections, revolutions, censorship, plain news.
Torrent and file services are almost impossible to classify beyond
their use as a whole. But you might get an indication of more
traditional usage by utilising IP based porn blocklists as the
accounting mask for that class.
Just beware that as a [exit] provider, making finer than aggregate
studies, such as down to the level of the content/streams
of a single user, is very hazardous.
Until the law eliminates Tor. Better to use Tor to prevent that
than distributing porn over it. Which is perhaps why you don't
see the Hefner and Flynt types jumping to multihome on Tor.

We have some trust in the MS stack concerning
ability to execute code and move packets properly.
Sniffing and sending the cleartext... that's an uknown
but is reasonably verifiable by watching the network.
They give away the source. There's some blurbs about verifying
their published binary hash with what you compile. However it's
unclear if the binary on the *phone* is meant to verifiably match
yours, if you can upload yours to the phone, etc. For over $1000
per endpoint in a mesh, that's not a solution for us.
Reimplementing it is.
I don't like cryptophone due to the cost and non-community
model. But they do offer an Android unit now.
That too. You should be able to do this with any street phone
having ARM or whatever ported processor.
I saw that but didn't get what it is. Please tell...
My understanding is Android is Linux, ie: Linux has been
ported to run on the phone processor (ARM?).
So I'm not seeing a reason to use Android proper, where
Linux plus any driver blobs stripped for use from Android
could suffice. Perhaps as an underground project if use of
said blobs that way would violate blobs license.
Unless it involves money or rep, auditing is largely a myth.
This is not a problem in this community.
And a proper app would recognize your incoming number
and use that app when you call people who aren't techs
(friend/family) but told to install it under threat of no calls.
For them, yes. For you, no, your graph will instantly point
to you. With that, encrypted content is your last bastion.
As in my former note, all we really want is opensource voice/SMS
encryption over the cell network, preferably without a data plan
(but not required).
Because cell's coverage area is better than wifi (which we can
already use for crypted wifi to wifi with any old app of the day,
(provided access to the mic and speaker) but not to interoperate
with cell, see the former data plan for that).
Everything after that is likely to be much easier... full disk encryption
of data, call lists, texts, mails, metadata, etc.
Maybe this is not the best tech list for that question.

Ok... serial AT modem bus to firmware processor[s] using shared

Watching them to see... if they are able to open the phone's telephony
drivers from the part suppliers that will be large news.
Android is Linux kernel (ported), whether the wrapping on top of it
after that is Android, Ubuntu or bash is just a matter of time.
Again, people can do all that with some app over wifi, and other apps on the
phone's FS. But what privacy conscious people like those on this list would
also want is the above described voice/SMS encryption over the cell network.

Anonymity and privacy are intertwined yet distinct. Some people
only have interest in privacy and do not care about the network
graph. Others need to go further and add anonymity.
Those are needed too!
Sorry, I should not have put SMS in with the voice tech, it's clearly
different, what spec it is I do not know other than maybe a side
channel to GSM. Imagine some way to do key exchange for it... could
be a lot of texts, or a voice channel/pad.
Presuming this is same as your 'CDPD', this is their take on it,
called CSD ...
If you don't want a data plan, this CSD tech is unavailable, and
you have software access to the mic i/o stream, it would seem
theoretically possible to compress, encrypt and send it over the
voice channel as you would with any landline modem. Or more crazy,
dongle with headset plug. As with you, I suspect it would be very
low quality, if you got it working over the rest of the phone/cell
path at all.
In the presence of cell provided IP transport (not coffeeshop
802.wifi), I admit such older tech is perhaps on its way out. For
now it may be a question of better price for your conversation,
minutes or megabytes. Free megabytes is less prevalent, and data
plans are not as often come with 'unregistered [prepaid] SIM'.
Some notes and links (unchecked)...
The history of cryptophone founding is interesting. It's probably
quite good, but the price and the model just isn't going to interest

I do see about 20% more onions online. Though the actual content
of onionland is not within scope, I would guesstimate a somewhat
higher 'have [ever] shared ... on purpose' count. And mixed in with
the recent influx of drug/bitcoin/product scam splashpages are a
few historically legitimate non-marketplace-based merchants (a now
antique model). Though a lot of the content is technically legal
(the lens of free speech or subject to jurisdictional variation /

put up with the complaints.

At the level of the resultant TCP tunnel (at the application layer, through
an exit or to an onion) all real IP's are effectively anonymized. Tor uses
a mix of PKI, DH, EC, etc in extending its paths and so on. Your
question involves that, ie: does your client negotiate using some
identifiables from that with each endpoint... Take a look at tor-spec.txt
and path-spec.txt.

Use socks5 127.0.0.1 9050.
So long as what you're doing uses TCP, you should be fine.
If you're traversing an exit, try issuing a NEWNYM.

any service used.

Maybe, sometimes Tor gets a little stuck, or the exit packetfilter's things
after Tor finds a path. Using MAPADDRESS can help with testing exits.
Yes, offering encryption is good.
As far as anything other than TCP goes, you can do that but only
if you're going hidden service to hs with onioncat or have
established an openvpn with some destination across tor exit.
And any testing of new apps should be accompanied by proof
work as to leaks with wireshark, etc.

There's non/offtopic breaks, such as host and user security.
False breaks, such as with documented design weaknesses... eg: timing.
And real breaks, such as 0-day against the daemon, protocol, or unknown
design weaknesses.
There are plenty of the first.
Few of the second, outside of the attack classes you'd find in the anonbib.
And hopefully any of the third have already made it to the changelog or
Does anyone recall a time in the past where a client or service was
actually at real risk due to something from the third?
Might as well add drugs to the OP's list. Those major services (eg: silkroad)...
a) have already been found and are still operating under whatever scheme
you wish
b) are impossibly (perhaps quite unbelievably) hard to find
c) are still there because no one's bothered to look, yet

there are plenty of small stores offering free unfiltered service to those
who wish to access a site that blocks Tor exits.
In a way, the small store often becomes a frustrated Tor user's guaranteed
path to popular services, under some level of acceptable location tradeoff.
Now if Tor could be peer aware and connect and exit relay through other
Tor nodes also using such small shops, there would be no location tradeoff...

Tor rightly does not accept full country names in its config, so CC's

This is twice now.. I never said anything of the sort. Nor did I

what sort of bad traffic traverse the net since before Tor and how
many gigs of it I block a month. Sorry your blog got hit somedays,
but don't take it out on those expressing ideas counter to yours
or turn that into bogus interpretations as to what they do in their
online/professional/personal lives.
My advocacy is clear and easygoing: Services should not block users
merely for using Tor, should find other ways to manage things, and
should do so for a variety of very good reasons.
Seems you have good access to your server and are able to process
and block lists of IP's and have ways to manage things locally as
desired without bothering anyone else. But, as earlier above, you
go further and force your opinion of Tor, specifically herein those
of its exits and users that have never done anything to you... down
thousands of other subscribers throats, and against tens of thousands
of Torizens... weekly. The likely majority of whom certainly do not
share your opinion. So while you're busy doing that why don't you
go and *freely block* yourself off this list because you're obviously
not much of a friend of Tor. And after that, figure out how to
linewrap your emails and stop top posting because it's hard to read.

Captcha doesn't really qualify as a Tor block, and is a

That's correct, BSD has less buggy, fuller and faster support of some hardware
than Linux ;) If you've got rare, fad, small, mobile or closed hardware, expect
to have to read the hardware list of many OS before choosing. If you've got
the same boring x86 workstation that Nx100 million others do, this is moot.
BSD/Linux all have packet filters, VM's, run browsers, Tor, and every other
common app out there. The differences are in the lineage, license, architecture,
development, packaging, distribution and use models. And of course, what's
under the hood in the kernel and libraries. Like BMW/Mercedes, picking
one or the other based on forum fans without doing your own reading
and playing probably isn't wise. Unless people state a specific use/problem
case that has a clear answer, they're all 'best for Tor'.
There are even some typical forum fans here: In that Tails, etc are customized around some typical Tor integration
parameters, they are definitely 'interesting for Tor'. The exact same could
be said for a similar BSD integration.
The user in question:
- can't use a live cd
- may be able to ditch windows (runs a vm under that for interim)
So the real answer is: flip a coin and run with one till you hit a more
specific wall.
- is new
Be certain that you learn to compile and install simple stuff like Tor
from source early on. If you don't, you will become dependant upon
some package system, possibly further modified by the distro. If
you do, your future Unix life will be wiser.

While waiting on a capitalist version of Tor, operators can publish
their cryptocurrency address in the consensus. Users who wish

with those accepting donations and send off some funds. There are

I've seen people out there streaming pirate radio over hidden services.
Once you get the stream up (which usually just involves waiting vs.
manual retry), and signaling aside (which can be for voip), the
stream itself works good. Though those streams tend to be constant
and heavy, unlike bursty voip. If you're having problems you might try
a constant bitrate stream codec or disabling noise/mic nulling.

@_subject: [tor-talk] A new check 
Keep in mind that while it may be frustrating to some users config
tests to find that they are temporarily using a false negative exit...
this 'multihoming' could, and should in fact, be considered a feature
since it keeps some exits out of the reach of anti-tor blocklists
that simply parse all the IP's out of the descriptor set. Similar to
how obfs and other design features keep Tor out of the reach of
anti-tor entities, making an anti to do a little work to be an anti is
a good thing. Thus having a good number of false negatives around
can allow you to reach places you couldn't otherwise reach due
to that type of blocking. That may cause philosophical stress to some
places that indiscriminantly [1] block Tor IP's by default, but also keep
in mind that Tor is dual use and such a policy is rather blind to that by
definition... as would be indiscriminantly blocking all coffee shop IP's
by default. So if the point of 'looking for false negatives' is to do something,
like attempt to convince the operators to not multihome... the better thing
to do would be to add regular false negative tests to the backend of the
check service so that these exits come up positive therein.
[1] Within a day ago I posted a link to a slashdot discussion of
one particular instance of this.

There are lots of HS certs out there. Some are just the usual
random certs. Some use this exact cn specification. I never
looked to see if any of them actually packed in the full HS
pubkey somewhere.
IIRC, torchat is just doing a bidirectional secret passing
pingpong between clients behind the HS addresses, no
actual x509 stuff. There's a good paper on it.
I think this pending may be holding a number of people back from deploying
some onion things today when it might get ripped out from under
them later. Whether for the RSA part. Or for good utility in maintaining
just the 80-bit addressing part as a map between EC addressing.
Where depending on how much of the current scheme is retained,
collision, spoofing, enumeration or even some continued risk of
deanonymization is not as important to their relatively non-sensitive
application, where making IPv6 transport work might be.
Not said as cause not to move forward, but to consider continuing
capabilities where possible.
Certs, yes, even for simple surfing... but no matter what is done there,
people still phish themselves all the time. There's just no hope for those
classic types.

I think I posted or ticketed along these lines a year or two ago.
The node keys were RSA so there was definitely utility in signing
assertions or encrypting things with them. Problem was
- tor didn't support passphrased keys at startup
- keys were then exposed to the world on a clone box
- they were only 1024 bit... most are moving to 2k/4k now.
- those same node keys were also the top of the chain as
far as tor knew about them. so you couldn't really have an integrated
offline ca/signature/gen scheme in place above them that would
effectively do anything as far as tor cared.
- I didn't actually get to testing keyops with them yet, particularly
to see if a sig/assert [self or other] on a pubkey was possible,
and then would make it to and be preserved by the dirs. The concept
died out largely for former reasons.
I think freenet has sequence numbers of some sort.
Yes, right now you're screwed. Though I think a downloadable
revocation crl would be better than forcing the former owner

@_subject: [tor-talk] Onion IPv6 transport needed [was: ed25519 HS identity 
I know, yet I don't mind the central nature of DNS for naming.
It works on clearnet, you can subscribe to multiple roots to avoid
censure and under an anonymous system someone will always
be willing to carry the sensational records. So you can resolve
just fine. The problem is the transport. Being able to resolve is
pointless if you can't transport. And if you can transport you can
resolve on top of that any which way you want, including DNS.
I'm sure this is not really a naming issue but an addressing
If people expect Tor, I2P etc to ever evolve to support for
real p2p/social apps and services and build communities beyond
what crippling unidirectional TCP is capable of (which I suggest
we should), they need to transport IPv6. And to do that you need
to have nodes fall within private RFC/48 addressing bound to an
interface... whether natively as Tor currently does by byproduct
with onioncat providing the layer, or via some future address
mapping layer [1].
The 'DNS' you speak of could map 80bit to n-greater-than-80bit,
(256/280/512 bit) within an internal backend of a new ocat that
then transports to the higher bits. But if actual DNS was used
for that it would invoke the root/censor/uptime/trust issues of DNS
for *addressing* not naming, and we don't really want that type of
breakdown there. Ocat currently does not have those problems.
And if someone comes up with the likes of [1], a central trust
system like DNS won't be needed.
To the extent this is a wider summary, if there's an IPv6 transport
(mod hidden addressing) ticket where reference to this should
be lodged, please do.
[1] Search for IPv6 on zzz.i2p, there were some comments
found there of possible map considerations like signed
announcements into DHT. Maybe also namecoin-like

You're right, there's a big gotcha in all this, users won't really know if
the services they interact with have been fixed [1] because huge swaths
of services simply don't publish what they do on their pages, they bury
it to keep quiet and shiny happy sites. Only some banks, insurers, utilities,
schools, etc will post "we're fixed" anywhere remotely prominent. So
you have to trust they did [2], which is a reasonable assumption given
regulation and liability of big institutional services. You should already have
a regular password changing/logout/session management regimen, so
inserting some extra instances of that along guesstimates of [2] should
suffice with these classes of service.

The real user risk is likely on mid to small services, embedded things, shared

reasonable regimen.

Break yourself of the habit of logging in as root and use ssh keys.
Unless the proxy app is broken there is no leak, that is easily testable.
I suggest it is more configurable and maybe even more reliable to use
proxycommand which is a common application pipe, than torsocks which

What you'd most likely want in that case is a single

@_subject: [tor-talk] [tor-dev] high latency hidden services 
Guilty of tldr here, yet similarly, with the easily trackable
characteristics firstly above, I'm not seeing a benefit to anything
other than filling all links with chaff which then hides all those
parameters but one...
Then as far as passive observation goes, you're left with only
packet clocking, for which you can use your bucket queueing randomizers
to defeat at no more than the cost of their average jitter width X
the number of hops.
Granted it does require a 'get what you pay for' dedicated pipe of
bandwidth [purchasing/giving] mentality, but at least among relays
that already exists today, and if that is returned by gaining more
resistance to GPA who can currently do something as simple as
counting bytes in a time and pumping your hidden services
while being their guard, well then, so what?
It's also conceivable that nodes could choose to carry a 'chaff
capable' flag. And that other nodes, and clients, could choose to
select and participate in that when building links.
Note, there's no change to the low-latency circuit based expectations
here at all, other than ability of CPU to process chaff operations.
Though that might be easier if using a UDP or packet switched model.
I'm sure someone has explored chaff in papers already. Is it valid?
As opposed to just requiring lots of new work to implement.
I can't see any other way to have both low latency and hide the
talkers other than filling bandwidth committed links with talkers.
And when you want to talk, just fill in your voice in place of the
fake ones you'd otherwise send. That seems good against the GPA
The other question is how, similar to Sybil, does chaff hold up
when an ACTIVE adversary runs nodes and can therefore discriminate
wheat/chaff on those nodes and perhaps communicate that among
their nodes on the backend to reduce things back to being counting
bytes in time above. I'm thinking it's not any worse than today's Sybil
and/or untrusted nodes, and thus not a factor in considering
implementing chaff.

It is 4 hops over 3 nodes to a clearnet destination.
That's 25ms average.
It's very tight, but possible. Max avg RTT is ~1000ms.
It is a single easy to find define. The default of three is the lowest
you can safely go, and it is also the optimum amount. Some
advocate four for some edge cases that aren't necessarily likely
to be used by an actual adversary. Once you find the variable name
you can search all the past threads about this. But until you've read
enough to really understand both Tor and your own security posture
to the point of being very well versed in both, turning random miracle
knobs in the source is not going to help you. Until then, stick to

A) Sybil up enough individual faces that can prove own their node
in person at meetups, give google checkable stories, are networked
in Tor/related communities enough, and pass the human bullshit
detector... to have an effective attack percent of nodes, maintained
as the "legit" node count grows.
B) Pay $/mo per IP to "cooperative" ISP's (or be a shell), to sybil
up nodes you have zero insight into other than an IP address.
Then consider which trust metrics you might use in your config.

No. Sybils / forgeries are influence attacks on the network itself (evil nodes,
eg: identities). Compromise the network and whatever rides on top of
it is compromised. Though attack on users by evil exits literally sniffing
goes away if the network has no exit feature (only hidden), nodes are
still relays, and Sybil there is still Sybil, regardless of her purpose.

The HESSLA is problem of untested utopian clickwrap that
criminals and govts will ignore, and that users and authors
don't know or want to deal with, so it needs relicensed to the
familiar BSD (two or three clause, like Tor uses) before it is
likely to attract new developers.
Phantom does run, but may need some fixes to compile,
and the platform specific tun(4) code needs more work.
One contributor put in some good updates, but against an
old rev, so that needs merged.
Seeded with nodes you know and configure, learned thereafter.
Fully DHT decentralized routing, no exits, presents its
anonymous network over a local IPv6 interface thus works
with all your favorite IPv6 enabled software. Probably most
similar to CJDNS as far as using it goes.

Yes the IPv6 interface is a specific point and a major feature. Like
CJDNS and OnionCat [1]... that gives the user access to whatever
apps they want to use over it, right out of the box. TCP, UDP, ICMP,
all of it, no problem. No porting, no waiting for someone to write an
app for the network from scratch, no need for socksv5.
I like forcing new dedicated apps (ideas) to appear [2], but not at the
expense of a variety of use / network adoption. Unless of course
the network is specifically designed for one thing. And with all
networks, using them securely is still up to the user as always.
[1] Tor-HS-v2 will break onioncat one-to-one addressing and thus be
no more useful than garlicat at that point. I think we need to come
up with *cat-v2 for those to regain one-to-one somehow.

There are people reporting that voice over Tor hidden services
is at least barely to actually useable, there is a lot of variance
though. Streaming low bitrate music is no problem. Latency is
about a second, setup can be a few+ seconds. Again, variance rules.
Regarding attacks, low latency and bulk data streams present
different surfaces. It would be interesting to see an anonymous
network that fills the entire banwidth you allocate to your node
with chaff during the time in which you do not otherwise need it.
The anonbib probably has something to say about that.

Hi sorry for barging in, but with all of the projects now based around
decentralisation, I thought a common place to exchange ideas would be good.
I have created a subreddit
 as a place for as many
projects to collaborate and share experiences,
research and general comments.
I am hoping to make this an open environment for discussion and technical
debate, but not a place of project wars. This is essential and to that end
I would like to engage with you and have you all sign up to the subreddit.
I believe as we recodnise more projects then at least one person from each
project should be a moderator. This should add stability and ensure that
each project is protected as they all have their own path to follow. I
suggest each project puts forward an admin and I will add them immediately.
I believe there is enough of a push now to decentralise services and
working together to achieve all of our goals can only be a good thing.
Below is the sidebar text as it stands, this is all open for debate.
This is a reddit of logic and not emotion, please base all debate on logic.
We do not want project wars here, so no vim/emacs type debate between
projects. Keep focussed and logical if at all possible.
Whilst people will prefer one project over another, the point of this
subreddit is to find the technically best solutions to the miriad of issues
and share technology and discussion between projects. Advertising is not a
goal of this subreddit, although new information about projects is
Submissions that are mostly about some other server based solutions belong
Please avoid repetition ? /r/decentralisedinternet is a subreddit devoted
to new information and discussion about decentralisation of the Internet.
New projects are welcome to announce themselves via this reddit, but after
those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be
re-posted. New news will be accepted. Aside from new project announcements,
those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's
self-serve advertising system.
Projects so far (please request to be added by posting a link to your
project, if it is upvoted and agreed by redditors to be accepted it will be
added here)
I am sending this message to each of the projects mentioned and any others
that should be included as we progress.

You Don't Have to be the NSA to Break Tor: Deanonymizing Users on a Budget
Alexander Volynkin / Michael McCord
Looking for the IP address of a Tor user? Not a problem. Trying to
uncover the location of a Hidden Service? Done. We know because we
tested it, in the wild...
In this talk, we demonstrate how the distributed nature, combined with
newly discovered shortcomings in design and implementation of the Tor
network, can be abused to break Tor anonymity. In our analysis, we've
discovered that a persistent adversary with a handful of powerful
servers and a couple gigabit links can de-anonymize hundreds of
thousands Tor clients and thousands of hidden services within a couple
of months. The total investment cost? Just under $3,000. During this
talk, we will quickly cover the nature, feasibility, and limitations
of possible attacks, and then dive into dozens of successful
real-world de-anonymization case studies, ranging from attribution of
botnet command and control servers, to drug-trading sites, to users of
kiddie porn places. The presentation will conclude with lessons
learned and our thoughts on the future of security of distributed
anonymity networks.

Right, in the likely context of the subject exploit, I referred only to
the similar .onion/.i2p hidden constructs that available for users.
Binding to and using them is a bit different of course but it all works.
And the .i2p's are generally as 'efficient' (speedy) in use regarding
initial connect, latency and bandwidth, if not better. (A lot of filesharing
is on i2p.) Bootstrapping into the net does take a while though. And
of course as with any other darknet you should run a 'non-exit' relay
to help out.
i2p does have 'exits' you can compare to tor as well.
Anyone can run an exit. But users have first find one
on a wiki list or somesuch, and then manually configure
their i2p to use it. Consider it like a bolt on proxy. Last
I checked one comes preconfigured but as such expect
it to be far overloaded. No reason there can't be many,

Nope, sorry, Tor is a multihop network. The cost to the net is about 7
times (hops) your own usage, so you will never be able to "stream"
VOB/TS in realtime, because each such home broadband user simply
doesn't have that much bandwidth to give back. And no, except for
estimates of idle users, no one's going to donate it from elsewhere for
you just so you can watch . So you'll crush yourselves out
before you even get started. And that's before you try to scale a million
concurrent users in the HSDir. Yes, multihop darknets make a good
filesharing platform, but only for non realtime delivery within the dictates
of your hop count. You're better to call it "popcorn week, at your cost".

No, not in the clearnet sense.
There is a one-to-one mapping between the Tor provided HS .onion address
and the onioncat provided IPv6 tun(4) interface address. You can pass
IPv6 packets between hosts over Tor as if Tor was one big IPv6/48
Layer3 network. TCP/UDP/ICMP/whatever... it's very cool.
The only way to reach the onioncat IPv6 tun(4) interface address is from
another onioncat provided IPv6 address across Tor (excepting locally
through the stack on your host, which you've hopefully firewalled as
needed). The only thing you can reach 'via the TOR HS hostname' is
the ocat daemon on 8060.
(ocat::1 <--> foo.onion:8060)  <-----> (bar.onion:8060 <--> ocat::2)
You can 'resolve' (actually, 'convert' for configuration usage) onion
and IPv6 addresses with ocat -i/-o. Onioncat takes care of that
automatically when passing traffic to and from your node.
You can also key the onions in torrc, use IPSEC, firewall, etc
if you need more control against access/spoofing.
Yes. You can use torrc HiddenServicePort to forward an onion
port to a port on your ocat IPv6 address, or ::1, or 127.0.0.1, etc.
In this case, there is no 'resolve', but it does 'route'.

Tor itself isn't slow, it's the bandwidth the nodes provision

And they all seem to think they can abuse/leech 7x their

In the long term steady state, users must support with open
bandwidth, and the circs may need to path through available
Now if latency (keystrokes) were to get much worse, that
would seem less tolerable than lower bandwidth.

ORport config exists to give better anti blocking/censorship

The problem is with you and your ISP, not other relays who

to those ports.
So if end user feels they are at risk of dumb triggers/policies they
should block their client from contacting such nodes in their
config. Easier if exists new option: ClientNoORPorts [...,] .
Or block such outbound ports on their firewall.
A relay operator who feels they are at risk of making such
contact should probably work with their host or find another
one instead of narrowing their possible outbound paths. (The
impact to tor network of RelayNoORPorts would depend on
percent nodes having your noisy ORport and traffic weights.
May also affect clients reaching specific exit relay using said
ports. And add more overhead signaling. Better to find new host.)

If your scripts are anything like before, you're going to need to
use the controller to manage exits, otherwise your data will
be left to the randomness of tor. That's fine to find random things,
but not very narrow to discover/test specific repeatable anomalies.
Lock down to a single exit (possibly chosen at random) for each
test run, or cycle a site through all exits (for which you will need

Yes. There are 3-4 barely visible steps
interesting in the thick blocked line too.
I put 10min on the fetch, but those steps around
120-150 could also relate to some stack timeout
in the fetch - webserver path. Nor is the
test machine quiet.
All as before, of the blocked exits, a sizeable fraction of

zero. No idea.

Since you seem to be letting tor pick its exits, sampling for
days might give a wider representative spread of exits. And
could plot things for each exit over time.
I see major prevalence of variation in your returned page lengths
in bytes, almost every exit varied. Only about 1% of my single fetch
across 1200+ exits varied from the exact normal byte count. It should
be determined whether tor software somehow causes this when
carrying 'slow' packet streams. By running in a loop the fetch from
bound to the exit IP of an exit relay affected by both slowblocking,
and showing byte variance.
No more variance = tor issue.

It was the first time I saw any site serving slow to some tor exits.
So I removed all variables and went for a single url fetch to confirm...
no recursion, redirects, embedded elements, robots.txt, or anything else.
I'm waiting for a slow affected exit operator to get back to me about
test to eliminate unlikely possibility of tor software itself.
This may actually be far less than overall fetch rate from tor users
to the top50, and certainly insignificant to the sites daily hit count.
Someone needs to research overall exit traffic sometime too.
If other sites are loading similarly slow it may be possible to find out
why or what is being used to do it. CL never replies to support queries.
A lot of the top50 use dynamic 'content' so it is expected on those,
unless fetching single elements.
I'm not too worried about emulation/hiding unless it affects the results

Next, disagree!
Email client exposure is limited only to the message content and the
rigorous and simple SMTP/IMAP/POP message transfer protocols.
And you can use any console client to reduce risk of interpreting message bling.
Webmail exposes you to the message content, the HTTP transfer protocol,
plus whatever the hell else they want to jam down your browser to interpret
and execute via that. That's beyond bad! And the odds that a console browser
will work well (if at all) with your webmail service are basically zero.
Both of them can have these equally, so this is moot.
Moreso, browsers are risky code bloated overkill for email.

Even draining Sponsors non-directed funds could be seen
as generically helping tor, which could help Sponsor say,

So if you knowingly go accept Sponsors funds without
a letter of permission, you better be ready to defend
yourself against closure of your entity. (Which currently
pays the wages for a handful of people [with strong beliefs

That said, tor is BSD licensed so it would still be around.

Depends a lot on if the donation amount is "significant", and/or

thing we don't like)". Yes, the US is a curious home for tor in these
regards. Yet moving it someplace else will have a different set of
pressures (though probably lesser), a different set of donors, coders,

'know who the user is' ... you need to precisely define that.
know their location [real ip]? - No, Tor protects them from that.
know it's the same recurring OVPN nym? - Not if OVPN is setup to
use ephemeral keying or a single shared secret posted on the wiki.
know their name? - Any exit can sniff users at the tor daemon, OVPN or not.
know their traffic? - Any exit can sniff users at the tor daemon, OVPN or not.
scrubbing? - There is some visibility to the 'raw' tunneled packets from the
user's stack. Similar to OnionCat, or to how browsers 'Panopticlick'...
we should document that so that users can make their own choices,
we provide an openvpn config file, etc.
Ultimately, this essentially brings what would otherwise be
third party OpenVPN service to pair with Tor via the exit relay
operators model everyone is familiar with today. Other than that
 it is an external bolt-on after Tor, and it is improper to compare
it with the expectations/capabilities of Tor as if it were Tor... they
are two completely separate things. It is optional for operators
to run one. And optional for users to use one.
Another aspect... the consensus is scraped and imported into
blocklists because Tor makes no restrictions on such use.
And they are unlikely to do so because TPO wants to play nice.
Now since maybe only a third of these independantly operated OVPN
IP's might be published on the wiki (the die roll thing), the other two
thirds must be found by scanning and then used to see if the shared
access token works. This OVPN service could be ToS'd as being only
for Tor users and not blacklists. Thus any appearance of an unpublished
OVPN IP on a BL could be challenged as to its listing source...
one such successful case of illlegal access to computer against
ToS would send a strong message to BL's not to do that.
A rather thin defensive tactic, but it is worth noting how the
consensus and OVPN differ in this regard.

What, controller auth? That's not exploiting a design weakness
[ie: timing], just an implementation bug.
Too long ago... if not this said bug, a link to actual leverage and
compromise news back then?
Rather, it presents untested hypotheses. As in the past with
these sorts of sites, the operator perhaps got vanned for reasons
other than any particular weakness of tor itself, or just vanished
for unknown reasons.
Even without the cluster of services in question there's still around
1150 onions to browse... nearly a full rebound from the former
value in monitoring these types of onions, the talk in their social
fora, legal cases, technical events and Tor developments such
as security of Tor HS whitepapers. That's really the only way to
resolve some of these hypotheses... with facts.
Given that we do have a couple such papers, and better knowledge
now that govt's do have some 'Snowden' capabilities, and even without
that LE are simply familiar and comfortable now in investigating darknets
and producing news events of related busts, I wouldn't doubt 'being
spooked into extreme caution" factor plays a big part. How do you say
in Bitcoin... "the coins are just moving to stronger hands"?
This level of retardation never ceases to amaze.
And this other trade (or scams therein), say in the subclasses of carding,
identity, corporate hacking... seems to doing quite well on tor. In fact,
here's a page full of nothing but scams...
Vigilante groups do exist on darknets, often exploiting just the posted
material alone.
There have been at least 20 wikis utilizing the 'hidden wiki' name, and
even more spinoffs, many before the original kpvz... so people need to
be specific as to onion address they refer to.

In a long thread starting here:
If I recall correctly, this subthread was about people getting
shuttered because their Apache etc was insecure, and that
somehow creating [paid] hosting services for them within
relatively general purpose nets like Tor was the solution. News:
those services are still open to the same exploits, and still use
the same HS mechanism that has potential whitepaper
exploits too. Further, he [or whoever OP'd the subthread] did
not define what they meant by "distributed' or "removing 'visibility'
of one end".
Stepping back from the above specific, and re: Freenet...
I think someone else mentioned or hinted at layering to
enhance things. Yes, interestingly you can in fact
layer some systems upon general anonymous transports,
especially if they offer IP transport. ie: Use Tor/I2P
with onioncat, cjdns, phantom... layer tahoe+lafs,
freenet, messaging, Bitcoin, torrent, etc on top. Gnunet,
MaidSafe and others I missed probably fit somewhere too.
Mash it up however you like. (Excepting where they did not
coordinate their collision spaces, such as in IPv6 addressing).
It tends to be complex, slow and fraught with timeouts,
but some combinations work ok.
At some point you must regularly sit back from your own
project or usage and take time to categorize all the systems
out there, what they are good and bad at, and then admit
to yourself (or as a user) whether layering is valid... or more
importantly, whether you should merge forces with other projects
to, up to and including, scrapping old and writing new projects
that provide both user utility and resistance against attacks
of interest. Or is your usage the best it can be? Can you in fact
create an all in one tool? Or can you create a well defined
intersection amongst projects / tools such that their layered sum
equals coverage against all attack classes, or the subset you're
interested in or subject to. And can you create a similar intersection
matrix for the services offered (web, messaging, storage) by such
networks. Can you coordinate research, structure and promote
projects in such a way as to cooperatively and formally provide a
complete set of resistance and services?

Along your three posts relative to the above...
Netflow at scale is a challenge but not an impossibility. First
address creating, recording and searching the flows. Then induce a
client/server to [regularly] create traffic you can spot and search
for it [1]. You don't need full take / DPI for that. And once a tap
is in place you can use it for both at once. Excluding the secret
tap itself [2], estimating costs of netflow per bandwidth is a
matter of common commercial parts. (Storage is fixed, but there are
probably some speedups to be had in creating, filtering and search
with custom gear.) ISP's routinely utilize netflow for engineering
metrics and security things.
[1] Tor, I2P, high latency, low latency, store-forward, etc...
perhaps with any non busy / non full of chaff / non fixed cell size
system this could be recognizably induced. And the list of relays
in these networks is known which allows you to select and handoff
those flows for dedicated analysis.
[2] Getting enough taps out there and at the right places to ensure
that your searches have some useful hit rate... now that seems the
hard and expensive part if you don't have some cooperation/force
with the Tier-n's.
For this induced purpose it's probably cheaper and easier to Sybil
up a bunch of nodes than to tap the internet. Yet I'd not discount
the possibility and value of some larger attempt at global analysis
like that. Especially since ISP's and researchers already do it on
their own scales.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Pissed off about Blacklists, and what to do? 
Regarding 'Tor users are worse than Internet users' and what to do
as a Project/Users about blocking...
As an example, here are 105,000 hits from people who had to (according
to what appears to be Craigslist's current unwritten policy) do two
generally non-anonymous things:
- post from Clearnet
- authenticate and use their phone number
 to
Fast networks and open wireless abound worldwide, so Clearnet is
going to be even more attractive to these and other maldoers if
they can use it. Note the estimate above just covers one particular
site and one class of possible troublemaker, the publicly incendiary
ones... the ones people complain to help desks about. Not the few
serious personal crimes they call the police about. Expand even
this boring abuse concept of inflammatory words, ideas and trolling
across more services and you have a large authenticated clearnet
'abuse' impact alone. So let's just drop the 'Tor is worse than the
Internet' argument shall we, especially in regard to any sort of
real load/annoyance to abuse/help/policy desks that would cause
them to block Tor... Tor is a outlier, particular in regard to
volume, the argument simply doesn't hold water.
Theory: Tor is being blocked mostly due to negative news media
perception, and kneejerk catchall solutions taking the cheap and
dumb route to systems and policy... not due to balanced acceptable
facts and specific measures therein... and you have to combat those
errors appropriately with facts and things of your own.
Just as with all the current specifically budgeted or time allocated
subefforts of the Tor Project, the Project needs to develop an
effort to combating this ridiculous blocking under the outreach
umbrella. Yes, pressure by individual users, and even groups of
users (any group examples?) has some impact, but there needs to be
a parent effort, a coordination, with hints/templates, targets and
milestones, and so on... both set *and advertised* by the project
or some lateral entity for users to *literally see and participate
in* and rally their own efforts under. Otherwise it's just a few
brave random shots in the dark that probably won't amount to much
against big blocking targets. Ask and dispel in Project talks 'Why
are you blocking shared Tor instead of single user accounts or
blocking the larger internet problem source?', go on site visits,
dedicate resources, make formal calls for research on 'Tor vs.
Clearnet [1]', target specific classes of social, shopping, forum
sites for quarterly action by users. Just as with guiding exit
relays, develop a self-serve framework for users who experience
blocking problems to follow. Make it easier for user to engage the
site comms barrier. Etc...
[1] Poking around your contacts in Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Outlook,
etc... will probably yield the spectrum of Tor users as being roughly
the same as the users of Clearnet, be they: good users, annoying
assholes like the above, or criminals. But the volume from Tor will
be nothing in comparison. Next, validate these informal guesses and
queries by turning them into formal papers where they can be of
The solution for account based abuse is to cancel the account. Not
restrict everyone else for it.
And related... the ridiculous assumptions being made based on the
IP/country you appear to be coming from have to be fought against
and thrown out of these service's consciousness too.

1) running exits on alias/tunnel IP's that don't appear in the consensus.

2) similarly running openvpn terminators (to allow udp, inbound binds, etc)
on say one IP higher or lower than the OR ip, or one port higher or lower
than the OR port. They cannot be published anywhere, even like bridges,
because some zealous lazy scraper will add them to blacklists. But letting
torizens find them on their own will suffice, especially with some of the

would notice this if they spent some quality time observing instead
of being alarmists for themselves. And that there's no known record

I erred in threading the link as part of that reply, which was meant
to prior talk on what a casual surfer/reporter might see and surmise
about hidden services.
The paper... is good. But maybe not the whole picture the casual
reader of it might believe it to be either.
Given current onion discovery mechanics as in the paper, public vs.
private is defined largely by the access restrictions operators put
up, not by whether they posted the address somewhere or not.
(descriptor-cookie and stealth auth may have more to say about
Revisiting categorization...
- They find 44% which some might call 'bad', at least for such broad
definitions of bad as 'adult, drugs, counterfeit, weapons'. That
means there is 56% good, for those definitions. Of that 44% bad...
a - They don't break down the 17% 'adult' further into what is commonly
divided as legal/good/commercial (18+) and illegal/bad (underage).
b - If you surf around, a large amount of the other 27% appear
to actually be one page scams and trolls of various kinds. So thus
other than being in their own category of bogus, they're not really
the genuine 'original bad'.
- The paper is focused on the mechanics and meta level rather than
a deeper editorial content analysis of onionspace. That's its chosen
scope and not a fault. (Oppurtunity exists for someone to do that
analysis project.)
- However they fail to list any of the 'good' non index/search/host/wiki
services in their top 547 popularity list. Inline they mentioned
some by name (wikileaks, strongbox, etc), by type (politics, games,
libraries), and should have seen other obvious ones that would be
likely to rank (the popular general social and discussion services
can see well over 100 posts/users/connections a day [compare that
to their lowest request counts]). A big table of only bad/neutral
doesn't present fairly. Though the paper doesn't read an anti good
HS bias, the reason for this table omission is unknown.
Using the paper to claim 'the vast majority of hidden services are
not socially laudable' would be difficult. (Especially considering
that what a lot of people complain about is just free speech that
they don't happen to like/understand and can't easily censor. Big
range between words like illegal, laudable, protected, activism and
so forth.) The last paragraph and a third of their conclusion is
spot on.
As to unseen services...
- When all you have is a TCP port serving http, unless a forward
URL list is published by the admin or users somewhere, what is
effectively your 'GET / request to an IP address' cannot possibly
discover all the virtual hosting and pages any given onion may
serve within.
- Missing are specific mention of many services/protocols we know
for a fact are online in onionspace such as sftp, nntp, xmpp, imap,
smtp, torrent, telnet, onioncat, etc. (Though perhaps generalized
by 'less than 50 each of those ... found 495 unique ports total,')
- No real mention is made of pairs for which they could identify
the protocol but could not access further due to various user facing
authentication methods. (The '5% ssh' may be a partial start there.)
- There were 15k onions (and their would be ports) which were offline
during the scans. So the purpose behind their existance remained
unknown. Same for the 1k previously active onion:port pairs offline
during the content phase.
- The scale may not have been large or long enough to collect a
full snapshot of the entire/intermittant onion space. They discuss
scale factors in their former paper, here there is little. Then
only 62% of onions collected were portscanned. And of those, scanning
only reached 87% coverage. Presumably ports 1-65535 were scanned
but stated is only 'full scan'.
Regardless of whether you're just manually browsing around the
surface, using the best crawler indexes, or using the methods in
the paper... there's still more riding on top of anonymity networks
than you think, and more than your probe will ever reveal or be
granted access to "see".
Just something to keep in mind when covering and balancing what is
out there.
ps: The likely reason they're seeing clients requesting nonexistant
descriptors is because there are other projects polling other
[old/defaced] onion lists. (one answer to pg 3 pp 2).

a service unusable by legit users who care about their
good privacy interests as noted on the tor front page.
Ever try to access a site via tor and be rejected for doing nothing
wrong? That's who.
Do not combine the two. Tor's encrypted circuits give source
anonymity. Tor's exits (or this OpenVPN/binding) give the
ways around things. Absolutely right, I wish to give users
ways to avoid gratuitous unthoughtful (in respect and consideration
to the individual legit user wishing access to such services) ways
around such blocking.
Only if you assume tor users are 'bad' actors. That is a shame
people think that.
Already answered.
Tor ITSELF is trying to defy all manner of policies, this
fits that just fine.
This makes no sense. I never said relay ops were bad.
I'm putting the idea out there. Some relays will, some won't.
You don't like it, you don't have to. Some blocklists and
site ops will scan and detect these new IP's, some won't.
Any that don't is a win for us.
Abuse it? Laugh, no more than users abuse current
Tor exits. Actually, it would likely be less incidence
of mundane flood of abuse since the moronic masses
of the internet won't bother figuring out how to scan
and setup OpenVPN over tor or using controller to
map non OR_IP exits.
Seriously? A thousand Tor exits compared to a hundreds of millions
of clearnet internet IP's cause more incidence of abuse reports that
need handled by abuse desks and LEA? Please, GET REAL!!!
I'm sorry you feel that the majority of tor users are bad.
Have you visited your local coffeeshop or home lately, how
many of those teenage freeloaders are bad. No difference,
maybe even worse incidence.
They are free to do that, we are free to continue to deploy
countermeasures against indiscriminate non user-account-based
Duh. Already said this many times. Tor users complain
about being blocked indiscriminantly when doing nothing
wrong themselves. Posts from these users are frequent
on tor-talk. And indeed as you listed, on that wiki page
as well. We should try to help them. This is one way to do
that. And to continue to put pressure on clearnet services
to deploy their own account based, NOT archaic ip based,
abuse management solutions.
No. Understand the diagram. It is not detectable by anyone
between torcli and torrelay, because that is just normal
Of course. Unless of course, as suggested before, some operators
choose the method of binding/routing their exit over an ip different
from their OR_IP, then it would just be native tor and native TCP.
No it won't, I've tested it, it works just fine. The only issue is the
exit ip may change. So the exit operator is expected to block
access to ovpn_ip from anything other than their associated or_ip,
and the user is expected to config their client to use only the
associated exit per whatever 'world' usage session they have in
mind. It's not supposed to be point-click easy, only possible.
Already mentioned that many times.
Obviously, and by design.
No it can't. The user is running ovpn and tor on their node,
and the exit operator is running ovpn and tor on their node.
The only thing that hits clearnet is tor, not ovpn. So there
is zero difference to any observer between 'user' and 'ovpn_ip'
there at all, all they see is tor. Same as before.
I know how bridges, pt, and bridgedb works. BDB is not foolproof,
neither is this, nor are they expected to be, it's an arms race, get it.
If you don't come out with new permutations, you lose.
I suppose i refer to parsing the consensus (readily available
to anyone who has no more elite skill than to run the client), as
Yes, you could abuse the bridge email/captcha. Yes you could
run your own 'webserver' and launch connections through all the
exit FP's to find non OR_IP bound/routed exits. Yes you could
even try the harder work to set up openvpn and scan around
the OR_IP for an ovpn connection and test that. The point is,
all of that is harder than parsing the consensus. Thus it is
not nearly as likely to become part of blocklist services,
or 'website' service operators personal blocklists, anytime
Then yhy don't you suggest users sign up and pay anonymously
for three separate vpn/shell services and onionchain them all together
and roam them around new vpn/shells once in a while. It's the same
thing. You see.
It was exactly the same setup, the diagram was added
since people were confused.
Users on ListOfServicesBlockingTor and tor-talk would dispute that
these days of late.
Yes, and they can still make those decisions. We're just making
them think more about it. On clearnet you as a service op when
you block an ip are usually taking out just one user. You should have
just deleted their account, but whatever. When you block a tor
ip you are stupidly taking out many many users who have nothing
to do with the account that caused you grief. That, in my opinion,
is WRONG. I run services, they are account based, and I refuse to
block access to me via tor exits. You can do and advocate differently
on your services or your exits. Just don't claim it is right for all.
I'm presenting and advocating an option for relay operators to
take up as they each to their own see fit.
I've already described this is NOT an integrated tor function. It is an extra
thing relay operators can do on their own, that users have to scan for
or otherwise find, configure on their own and generally deal with. Of
course it won't be slickly integrated (unless the operator chooses the
purely tor based non OR_IP binging/routing method). Users will try
their termination, and if they can't get through to their chosen destination
because the ovpn operator has blocked it, they'll try some other
termination point.
I know exactly why DNSEL is published. On one hand it
is great, on the other it is abused by clearnet service operators
who, in my and others opinions, are not giving enough thought
and effort into other ways they can address 'abuse'. I also know
Tor Project has a budget for outreach, in part of which is meant to
educate about some of these other local abuse management ways
besides blocking access to services via tor. Maybe it's time that
budget proportion and time allocation was increased.
Obviously. AES-NI helps. However it does not necessarily need to
be encrypted (or even heavily) since the user still has a full tor-cli to
tor-exit path established. See the diagram. It is the exit that is
their security, the ovpn is just adding a new ip/protocol service.
No, again, tested, quite tolerable for low sensitivity uses
such as everyday web traffic.
I suggested that as well. Feel free to do so.
I do not speak for myself. I speak for all the users who
may wish to do whatever it is they want. Exactly as
they can do whatever it is they want over TCP today.
If they want to setup GRE/IPv6 tunnels, if they want to
use DNS and voip protocols, NFS/RPC mount, it they
are an engineer and want test raw IP/ICMP, if they
want to game, torrent or anything else... is *not* up to me.
Relay operators are free to set up their own tor exit nodes
and extended tor binding/routing/nat and openvpn services
however they see fit to each their own as always.
These two methods are something that can definitely help
some legit users, therefore I suggest it be done by whoever
in the relay community wants to.

Seems not much tech issue here, the tor client treats .onion as special
and funnels the whole thing to the dht. tor will get a new config bitmap
that says 'set priority to resolve .onoin in dht or external first, or remain
exclusive in one', plus dedicating different sockports / portflags to
all those settings. You're protected by circuits so it won't really matter
which one you choose. And onions only have fwd 'A' naming semantics.
If your queries are heavy or not exclusive tor will end up eating
the useless overhead via dht or exits. So try to play nice and stay
off the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.onion pron sites ok.
Users leaking dns / failing to redirect dns into tor is not a tor problem.
Unlikely we'll ever see a return to Postel style grants/reservations

@_subject: [tor-talk] ICANN and .onion 
I'm going to rebut these two replies a bit.
TPO makes Tor, the client, and some surrounding tools, and docs,
and efforts regarding Tor in the world. It's not Tor's responsibility to
somehow reach into users machines, understand all their configs,
and magically reconfigure them and all their apps to talk to Tor.
Tor provides the client interface, users must get their packets there.
Tor does help by providing a wiki/tor-talk/irc/stackX/etc where users
can discuss how to do that for their apps/OS. And they do provide
TBB. Users can further choose from Tails/Whonix, etc. But ultimately,
as with any other tool, it's up to the user, not Tor. I want users at
all levels to be able to use tor properly, but the amount of work and
handholding is simply outside the scope and capability of TPO.
FWIW, I think out of...
- Developing TBB.
- Spending time to, in fact, say, have the client trigger each OS's
routing/filter API into routing everything into tor.
...that it's better that tpo do tbb because tbb tech (and pushing it
upstream) is more valuable to the world than turning your box into
yet another boring single purpose router brick (that has already been
done, and users can customize by using the above resources).
.onion HS is unrelated to the 'place' of apps 'leaking' dns.
The talk of how to handle a day if .onion becomes a
non-reserved-for-tor clearnet tld is also separate from that.
(Or Tor could simply elect to flag day over to .noino, but
that could become an arms race.)
Tor client is not a sysadmin app, so it follows standard models
to not go mucking around your system like an SA. That includes
pointing the system resolver to DNSPort (which would break
everything to go in that default direction), or "come with pre-installed
DNS" (daemon and configs presumably).
DNS "leaks" really refer to, and only occur as a result of, apps
that fail to send DNS alongside TCP according to an applicable
SOCKS5 directive given to them. Or from uncharacterized/unsolved
situations with torsocks (due again to apps/system doing
odd things). Those, or users simply not configuring things
(that do work correctly) into tor properly, are not a tor problem.
You have to learn and know what you're doing to use Tor
properly, and in a way that suits your setup, it says so
right on the tin.
Or go for prepackaged TBB, Tails, Whonix.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Facebook brute forcing hidden services 
I would never use this unless you were actually censored from
accessing facebook via clearnet. All it will do is serve to officially
tell facebook that you are a tor user that FB can then further
discriminate against as a class in the future once they start to
lock down clearnet against exit nodes, travelers, etc or whatever
their scheme is or will be.
Remember, FB's official policy is still:
- Real Names required
- Phone Numbers / ID required
- DOB required
- Gender required
- Email required
- Etc required
- Users are the product that is being mined and sold and shared.
Such non optional elements, and choices, powers and rights
removed from the user, are in direct opposition to the principles
of Tor and anonymity. Normally support for onion/i2p is good thing,
but when still backed by crap like this it's largely meaningless.
[Some posters already seem to be getting locked out
for using onion but of course cannot truly know why
because FB does not state their metrics.]

Absolutely. Not just due to OpenBSD's security positioning, but
moreso from network diversity. Windows is its own world. But if
you're a Unix admin there's no reason Linux should be deployed
20x more often than [Free/Open]BSD. It's ridiculously counter
to meeting diversity goals, especially with bandwith weighting
if one platform is getting grossly disproportionate traffic than another.
Just pick one of the two BSD's and run it instead. FreeBSD
in particular is well suited to the OS and network needs of Tor.
And knowing how to admin more Unixes will serve any admin well.

Attack surface on a well adminned relay comes down to three things:
- Network stack itself (kernel)
- Daemon software itself (tor + remote admin)
- Their respective use of other kernel/library/shell provided resources.
I might suggest the current proportion of Windows to Linux is
roughly ideal. This is primarily because, all other things set equal
at 'minimal' (= tor + remote admin), good adminning, and good
control of corporate secrets (or moles)... Windows still has one
huge strategic weakness at that point... the magic packet.
It's the whole binary vs. opensource argument. So essentially,
the correct ratio of the two might be the odds you place that
a binary OS has a magic packet. Today's node count shows
73% to opensource platforms. I'd suspect 73% is about where
a lot of analysts might bet on Windows being magical, whether
by/for the NSA, or any other reason or source.
(Remember this...
 That was just from running 'strings'. Good luck trolling all of
Windows with a disassembler... a nice fat payoff if you do. And
the number of disassembling vs. opensource auditors is probably
even more heavily skewed. And Windows is 'trusted' by buyers,
nor can you replicate their binaries from any 'source code sharing
agreements'. Then it's Patch Tuesday again... so it could be no
one has or ever will disassemble audit it. So odds end up being
pitched instead. And for many applications, that's good enough.)
The real problem below is the 96% allocation of opensource to
Linux and 4% to Other opensource. That's something that should
be fixed. For these purposes, it doesn't matter which BSD/Other you
pick... once you get the security odds there back towards
say 50:50 Linux:Other, then you can debate userland and relative
security amongst them all you want.
Here's some links to get you started, including two other
main branches of the Unix Kernel family tree at the bottom...

I'd expect if some of the big relays switch to any other OS

and laws be damned... well, the old ways are over, it's the Wild West.
Filling all the network links with chaff could be a way to protect users
(maybe they were just loading the homepage over and over), but they
could still bounce all the IP's to look for servers.
There may be an oppurtunity for the operators of anonymous services
to band together and monitor themselves or each other for bounces
simply to confirm if bounce tests are infact happening against all such
service participants, high data/connection rate ones, services based
on age of identity key, or any other such class they are able to identify.
And they'd have to characterize true bounces from network reachability
This is hard to defend against. Store-and-forward... maybe.
Decentralized p2p/blockchain... more likely, at least for market-like
things that could be modeled as transaction-listing-like things.
Another way to test is for someone to use perfect opsec (wifi, tor,
bitcoin, etc), and actually run a number of illegal sites and see what
happens. Then consider some sites may be allowed to live even if
actionable, or simply won't be taken down if there are no real world
links to act on.
Tor had one recent whitepaper that claimed to have actually located
hidden services (real or test) within a minor budget and timeframe by
abusing nothing other than the Tor network itself. Right? Has anyone
replicated that work?
People need to be analysing these court documents very carefully to see
what bits of knowledge can be drawn from them. That's a project in itself
and EFF/Tor wiki would be a good home to begin cataloging them all
and making notes of such things in each case.
It's pretty obvious something is going on besides opsec, especially
with the quotes in the news. Question is, what is it?
Tests need done, knowledge needs found, capabilities need catalogued,
and defenses need developed. Step by step, scientific method.

and laws be damned... well, the old ways are over, it's the Wild West.
Filling all the network links with chaff could be a way to protect users
(maybe they were just loading the homepage over and over), but they
could still bounce all the IP's to look for servers.
There may be an oppurtunity for the operators of anonymous services
to band together and monitor themselves or each other for bounces
simply to confirm if bounce tests are infact happening against all such
service participants, high data/connection rate ones, services based
on age of identity key, or any other such class they are able to identify.
And they'd have to characterize true bounces from network reachability
This is hard to defend against. Store-and-forward... maybe.
Decentralized p2p/blockchain... more likely, at least for market-like
things that could be modeled as transaction-listing-like things.
Another way to test is for someone to use perfect opsec (wifi, tor,
bitcoin, etc), and actually run a number of illegal sites and see what
happens. Then consider some sites may be allowed to live even if
actionable, or simply won't be taken down if there are no real world
links to act on.
Tor had one recent whitepaper that claimed to have actually located
hidden services (real or test) within a minor budget and timeframe by
abusing nothing other than the Tor network itself. Right? Has anyone
replicated that work?
People need to be analysing these court documents very carefully to see
what bits of knowledge can be drawn from them. That's a project in itself
and EFF/Tor wiki would be a good home to begin cataloging them all
and making notes of such things in each case.
It's pretty obvious something is going on besides opsec, especially
with the quotes in the news. Question is, what is it?
Tests need done, knowledge needs found, capabilities need catalogued,
and defenses need developed. Step by step, scientific method.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Netflow analysis breaks Tor 
'Tor Stinks', well yes, both in:
- how hard it is to for adversaries to attack using certain methods
- how poorly it defends against other methods of attack
If your threat model is the former, use with confidence.
If your threat model is the latter, stop using it.
[Of course there's a broad middle area too.]
I'd suggest it's entirely appropriate to freak out whenever any
attack appears that forces you to transition from the former category
[closer] to the latter. Particularly if it can be applied ex post
facto, such as through analysis of recorded traffic.
The piling on of similar papers may be redundant, but the message
regarding particular threat models is not.
Even with attacks with relatively high false positive rates that
also have a much greater true positive rate, adversaries in places
that don't have restrictions on such errormaking will simply round
everyone up. In that sense, they are valid messages too.
Speaking of what stinks and what can be used, where, and against
Tor does a lot of research, it should put up a simple checklist
matrix page for that... attacks and uses it's good for, and those
it isn't. Link it to relevant sets of papers. And include in the
matrix comparisons to other projects like Freenet, I2P, Retroshare,
mailmixes, etc. The anonbib's of the various projects are good for
developers, but users need to see a much simpler one page matrix
on a wiki. No reason other projects can't contribute there as well.
Giving and taking comparisons is part of doing it better.

@_author: grarpamp 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Propsal for decentralization of the Tor network 
Maybe the centralization issue should revolve around things other
than such two sided math proofs should neither side win...
1) There's expectation that some TPO-like entity will blackball
known bad nodes, a non-human distributed authority (be it DHT or
otherwise) doesn't permit that. Which is actually a non issue because
users can simply subscribe to whichever trusted blackball source
they desire. Onionland may still be providing some of these bad
node listing services.
AFAIK, that's the only real service Tor authorities provide today.
The rest is under the hood of the *only protocol* in (3) below.
2) The network simply cannot run if some or all of the nine authorities
are taken offline. Even users passing around their descriptors file
and continuing to run can't be done because the code doesn't support
that. So the network dies. Tor right now is like the centralized
'illegal' filesharing traffic model ie: Napster... every single
central sharing service that had human figureheads in control of
the network got shutdown. When the heat comes to Tor, it will get
shut down if its fixed human authorities can't stand the heat.
There are not an endless number of figureheads, but there are an
endless number of users. For which, as with DHT torrenting and
bitcoin, the responsibility for those networks is so distributed
that it's pointless to try taking them down. Phantom, I2P, and a
number of others are also distributed and seem to be working fine
as well.
3) Bitcoin and torrent also work as protoools because all users
agree that the protocol is *the one and only true protocol*, they
are at risk if they change, so a self maintaining gravity is both
present and natural. If there are forks, they don't last because
users figure it out and abandon them or at least stop until the
network figures itself out. This is why Tor bootstrapping isn't an
issue either... you're unlikely to bootstrap yourself into a bogus
network for very long, especially if you do reasonable research in
the network socialnet beforehand.
Self host the repository, ship with signed recent descriptor and
bad nodes subscription lists, bootstrap into that, and let network
dynamics and user choice run from there. At least that's the model
of some other networks.
Tor is probably central today as a result of inheriting a central
design model. Thereafter if not remaining so from simple gravity
then from either:
A) waiting for a chance to stand up with its authorities for the
   sake of proving out fundamental privacy/speech geopolitics.
B) putting them in the position of standing as test fodder.
C) trending nefarious.
Tor is a US entity which has certain benefits and weaknesses. And
the international support structure of (A) should be analyzed and
stress tested to determine its strength bfore relying on it. All
the while noting and incorporating similarities to the WL, Snowden,
filesharing, and crypto battles, etc.
Curiously, whenever all is said, it's still useful to have both
centralized and decentralized networks surviving under pressure.
Yet is centralization actually *required*, say to achieve something
specific beyond that, or which cannot be modeled decentrally with
some decision elements pushed out to the user.

Following on some related and technical comments...
While my analogy and definition of security may not have been best
suited, nor is this reply, the point remains that there is nothing
special here for you as a corp. Anything you say that LE can provide
for *you* with honeypots can also be sourced internally or from the
open market and your subsequent call to LE to mop up upon discovery
of badness therein.
What is unique here is that LE will be classifying things learned
from the HP's as gov't secrets. That's a hard problem. As opposed
to telling you all of what you need to know to secure your own net
under internal policies and vendor contracts that you would otherwise
remain in control of.
Further, technically, parking an HP on your net only tells you about
what happens regarding via that HP, nothing else. And since you
must distrust this other party HP [1], then all you've got is a
cracked HP outside your trust zone, no different than any other box
on the internet. It's limited vantage point and bogus security
metrics argument.
Sure, the US gov't might be able, on the whole from this, to correlate
and expose more nation-state/international crime sources against
the US and embarrass some foreign diplomats. That's always a good
and fun thing [2]. And the services of LE are indeed valuable.
However do not make the mistake of thinking that *you yourself*
will benefit *directly* from this program, that's not what it's
designed for or capable of. In fact, you will be left out as dog
food in case of 'national security priorities/secrets' arise.
The responsibility for securing your net still rests with you and
you alone as always. The better way to be more secure is to ignore
these silly sales schemes and look same effort at your own processes,
weaknesses, code, OS/hardware, compartmentalization, etc. Maybe
<=1% of that ends up being the use of HP's. Improve those own things
overall and you'll be far better off.
Last, what if one day *you* _need_ to use a freedom network and
they've sybil'd up their nodes *against you*? Be careful what you
ask for and invite into your home in the name of security, you might
just get it... applied against you in time of need.
Well then the solution there is clear... get rid of the MS boxes,
and those who sold and administer them. Like HP's, nothing special
about MS either.
Time limited I maybe not reply further.

Biryukov, Khovratovich, Pustogarov
Bitcoin is a digital currency which relies on a distributed set of
miners to mint coins and on a peer-to-peer network to broadcast
transactions. The identities of Bitcoin users are hidden behind
pseudonyms (public keys) which are recommended to be changed
frequently in order to increase transaction unlinkability.
We present an efficient method to deanonymize Bitcoin users, which
allows to link user pseudonyms to the IP addresses where the
transactions are generated. Our techniques work for the most common
and the most challenging scenario when users are behind NATs or
firewalls of their ISPs. They allow to link transactions of a user
behind a NAT and to distinguish connections and transactions of
different users behind the same NAT. We also show that a natural
countermeasure of using Tor or other anonymity services can be cut-off
by abusing anti-DoS countermeasures of the bitcoin network. Our
attacks require only a few machines and have been experimentally
verified. We propose several countermeasures to mitigate these new

That faq needs rewritten. It's not socks that 'leaks' what is passed
to it [1], it's the app leaking dns around the socks proxy it was told
to use (except for socks4 where that is the expected app behaviour).
Though once the app does properly pass a hostname to
socks4a or socks5, the socks server should resolve it.
Note that socks4a spec can and does handle a real IP just
like socks4, socks4a is thus not just strictly for hostnames.
Tor should not be warning about receiving an IP on its socks4a or
socks5 interface since technically it's both ok and commonplace for
users to specify only an IP as their destination. Save it for debug mode.
Tor also needs to move away from legacy mention of socks4 / socks4a
in preference to socks5. Or at least instruct to try and test socks5
configurations first... socks5 is the only one to handle ipv6.
[1] Unless your socks client lib is so crappy that it tries to
resolve namelikes itself in a leaky fashion without sending
them to the socks server.

random unknown participants ie: Bittorrent, or people on dynamic or
mobile), you're currently constrained by address collisions:
- Trying to pack the entire IPv4 address space you might want to
'call' into your tiny 10.0.0.0/24 adapter space. Same for put entire IPv6
space into your private IPv6/48 adapter space.
- Similarly what you're going to do when Tor moves to wider than
80bit onion addressing which currently fits nicely into a private IPv6/48.
(Need a secure IPv6<->onion address mapping layer pushed into a
DHT/blockchain or just resorting to trusting some volunteer run in-net
lookup service.)
edit: Just noticed badvpn's mention of pushing a *VM* on a 10 address
through socks with this, at least for TCP, which is simpler. As opposed
to pushing any app on the raw iron through a *VPN* which could be
constrained as above. Left this anyway for thought in related things.

Tor as a client also needs support for inbound binds for some apps, at
least at the single per port level when interacting with internet at the far
end. OpenVPN might, or could be extended to arbitrate those port
binding requests.
Hidden services do support such binds in hs-to-hs mode, at least

There are about ten exit nodes that do only this today.
[One of which is run by Mike Hearn who has advocated building in
censorship capabilities to Tor, and blocking (historically) tainted coins

innocent transactions with you, or from your own trans/mixing with
Then there is question if your client will select such 'only *coin' nodes
versus those with high bandwidth and open exit policies.
There are also a fair number of hidden services in Tor/I2P/CJDNS
that act as bitcoin nodes.
As related tangent, yes, the bitcoin protocol needs to be encrypted
on the wire, at least bitcoin node to bitcoin node with TLS, obviously
and urgently so, particularly if you wish to guard your trans from
wire listeners.
You might be best to in fact run bitcoin always and entirely over Tor,
especially while transacting.
But then also routinely compare that received blockchain to one
you receive via alternate/trusted sources, such as clearnet or signed
bittorrent checkpoints.

@_subject: [tor-talk] using UDPGW and tun2socks over Tor 
You can't *receive* 'calls' without inbound binding capabilities, or using
internet call servers in the middle as meetme proxies. Out of the box,
tor is crippled in that inbound regard when interacting with the internet.
If you refuse to give third party servers [meta]data, then you're stuck
with unidirectional calling. OpenVPN could do inbound TCP/UDP binds
at the exits, tun2socks TCP can't, don't know if udpgw UDP can.
Tor transports only TCP. You outline running udpgw clients locally
and udpgw daemons on the exits such that badvpn can tunnel UDP
through udpgw client through badvpn over tor to the far udpgw daemon
then out to the internet.
In the linked mail thread I suggested running OpenVPN on the exits
(instead of udpgw daemon), that will give the user general access to
not just TCP and UDP but to all protocols from 0-255, most notably
ICMP and others typically used by network/system admins. As bonus
you also get optional inbound binds which badvpn-udpgw cannot do either.
The badvpn-udpgw TUN model presented to the VM is the same. Though
instead of handing all TCP to the local tor client via SOCKS5 and then
UDP to a udpgw exit over a TCP tunnel therein... all traffic gets tunnelled
with OpenVPN TCP connection over tor to OpenVPN on an exit.
Also, it seems badvpn-udpgw would leave each user TCP streams up
to tor client to route at will, but route UDP over tunnel to a fixed udpgw
exit and configuring the two to use the same exit would be complex.
Whereas OpenVPN tunnels everything to a fixed exit over a single
circuit. ('Fixed' could just as easily be random or rotated by the
configuring user as in the linked mail thread.) Unlike badvpn-udpgw,
OpenVPN also works on all relavent client and server platforms.
Hope that's a more comparison of badvpn-tun2socks/udpgw
to OpenVPN models for VM and general use.

Be careful with various gender positioning. The current link under

those that tilt misandry, or further, that exhibit more agnostic
properties regarding any of subjects, actors, and audiences. Extreme
consensual BDSM, Satanism, biomedical/genetic engineering? Who
Anyway, the question here is not the narrow of gender, but of discussions
regarding, and presence of, politically hot content. One thing can
be certain, a policy of "never responding" does not advance anything,
most important of which is understanding... the first step and key
to anything rational. And being that "an existential threat to Tor"
may be "the morality of hidden services", such discussions are
essential ones to have.
As it may restrict/hazard Tor, TPO members might not comment or
take position... other than keeping the list friendly and, as needed,
free of actual illegal material that would threaten the list itself [1].
Those interested in discussing onionland may wish to do so in
onionland on the various forums. There may be use for a tor-hotbutton
list, but since everyone posts to tor-talk first, it probably wouldn't
carry much traffic.
The OP of the original thread seemed fair to include the link. eg:
commentary / journalism is better supported by reference to source
material. In part, so readers can validate the reporting and form
their own opinions.
Here are some more links, for the Journalism and discussion...
[1] Another question may be, in what jurisdictions are links
themselves illegal?
We may develop such technological capability, but it's naught without
laws that, for instance, forbid business, government and even people
from collecting you. You must regain/hold the legal right to be
your own broker and sole authority against infringement otherwise.
Encoding basic 'privacy' rights in law may be easier achieve than
encoding/battling for them in tech without backing of law. Rather,
support law with tech. Tech without law is but wish/direction for
law to move, or a parallel.

You could run I2P over Tor, perhaps via onion, and definitely
with onioncat. But why? Yes, layering resistance technologies
is good. But you will have no other I2P peers to connect to, for a
very long while. And it will be very slow. Same for I2P over Tor.
Now if you were to run Bittorrent or any other application layer
'network' over Tor (or I2P), IRC/NNTP/etc that would be different...
you would acquire peers fairly quickly.
Were you to ask I2P community, option 'c' will never happen.
And due to slowness as natural discouragement of 'a' and 'b',
Tor probably doesn't care since though technically possible,
it won't happen en masse anyways.
Similarly, does I2P care if Tor can route traffic over I2P?
Doubtful, but as with Bitcoin support, options in both
directions are always fun to have :)

Yes, there should be more comparative analysis
of approaches amongst all the current networks. Create
a dedicated group that publishes such things on a darknet wiki.
Hold not just project specific meetups as is done today, but
genuine summits amongst all such projects that puts
their specific projects aside and determines what models
might best suit the next 10-20 years. Determine whether the
community is too chained by legacy project/product entrenchment
to adopt new better approaches that have come up in research
since they themselves started their own projects. Find
any worthy new techniques and peel off interested developers
into new projects. Try to ensure that big well known
projects aren't soaking up all the fanfare/funds when
equally valid small projects, or new projects would benefit
the world the same or more than the gorilla in the room.
For example, there seems some merit in filling your
internode links with chaff padding up to the bandwidth
limit you configure in order to mask both when and
how much you are communicating.
But it does not seem any project is doing that?
Perhaps because chaff transmission/management/security
models are not well developed. Or just the 'woah, bandwidth'
reaction, which in reality of the simplest design only
affects you and what bw you were willing to purchase
or experience anyway (as when operating under a
non-chaff network with a given/high utilisation condition).
Another example... there was, or is, at least one group
accepting funds and then running some of the various
overlays equally at once... tor, i2p, freenet, cjdns, mailmix.
Take some time to step back and see what together you
can do with the big picture in all areas... research, development,
operations, marketing.

The exact same thing would have been said ten years ago about Tor.
On the contrary, once things look 'pretty good' on paper, you
need live networks to test things out at scale and attract
attention. If it's not broken you need to support it, let it run
and see where the idea goes. If it's not your own project or
favorite app you may unfairly downplay it, naturally. So
running such nodes in that manner helps give everyone
agnostic chance.
NSA may have give preference in analysis/presentations to
systems based on usage they see. Tor has share, others don't.
And if NSA docs on any other system existed at the time, Snowden
may not have got them, thus we can't know what they say.
The real question is: with Freenet, I2P, Gnunet, CJDNS,
Phantom, Tor, etc... afaik all seemingly 'pretty good' and not
broken... *why* are their adoption shares ranked however
they are? Well, you must discount Tor since it is the only
one with seamless integrated exit feature at scale [though
you can coordinate exiting manually over OpenVPN with a few
of the other networks]. If Tor had no exit feature, you'd likely
find it *behind* other nets in market share since it carries
only TCP. And it's probably at equivalent levels of R&D
as a non-exit transport (or lesser since the other nets never
had real design interest in exit, whereas Tor 'got lucky' bolting
on hidden services after the fact).

All the projects have milestone dates, knock another five years off
if that one doesn't make you happy.
So is any other project, you can't just wish project/code into
being. And everyone has their own maps.
In general: blah blah blah, we all started somewhere from the exact
same position, zero. Including Tor.
For you to be able to successfully bash any other network project,
you need to be able to show that their whitepaper design fundamentals
[1] are broken.
Pointing out cute little javascript [2] XSS holes [3] that root
your configuration system, while surely unwanted holes, is childish
for a comparative reviewer to do. They are not architectural flaws
in the overall fundamental design of the darknet itself. They are
issues in the periphery that everyone makes and that will be
fixed/rewritten in time. Tor is no stranger to this either, go look
through the security and other sections of the Tor changelog.
Further, Tor has known and unfixed de-anonymization attacks against
its hidden services, and by extension possibly out to the client
as well if the guard is evil. That's not a cute hole. And being
fair, other networks likely have similar current weaknesses.
[1] For example lacking better terms, Tor uses circuit switching
over onion routing with fixed human directory authorties at the
top, I2P uses packet switching over garlic routing with no such
central authorities.
[2] You could just as easily bash Tails or TBB here for leaving
javascript turned on.
[3] "The approach utilizes cross-site scripting vulnerabilities along
with Javascript to reach into the internal I2P router configuration
Some questions defeat themselves ie...
Current trends award more rockstar for proving brokenness and treat
proving correct as academic. BTW, no one has shown Tor correct,
some show it weak to various things.
These are likely human factors, you have coders, you have salesmen,
they don't usually come in one group/person. I2P just added salesmen
by redoing their website and launching an umbrella. It's also not
so easy to say there are more java developers skilled in this
particular application space.
You've clearly not spent any time in, and cataloging the contents
of, the various darknets.
Botherders historically think in terms of clearnet and needed exits.
There is no proof i2p is not in such use. And being a simple binary,
Tor is much easier to package and run as part of an exploit.
Whatever. Lack != Fact.
Tor should as well be able to say the first quote, the third quote,
and since anyone can be on the take, even the second as well... but
it doesn't. Here's what these two projects actually say...

If I wanted to try Unix/OBS versions I would. And I might if these
issues are ever resolved and they are picked up and looked at by
more Unix's.
I'm defending users who might be considering running the binaries
you distribute. As far as I can tell, no one has ever been able to
reproduce them from your sources. And you haven't posted sufficient
details about your platform to make whatever compilation notes you
posted worthwhile. "32 bit windows" could be anything.
I also can't find OpenPGP signatures for the binaries or the sources
that you distribute.
Nor can I find a reply from you or "Mike Weber" or anyone else
regarding all these issues.
So if I use the source without blobs I'm safe, but if I use your
windows binaries I'm rooted? Or should this mean that you know
windows sucks but you're writing to it anyways, and perhaps you
don't care much about the implementation quality there.
Now because you're a member of GoldBug Messenger on SF...
Are you suggesting that users ignore the falsehood you put in your
announcements and just trust your software?
(Is that what all those anonymous 5-star 1-review posts of GoldBug
to mostly second and third class windows software aggregator sites
are about... building trust? You can google for those.)
Or are you saying that you somehow forgot to post your own project
denial of Randolph / Thomas posting as if they were associated with
your projects?
Ok, well maybe you did forget that, so let's see who has control...
"Brought to you by: berndhs, mikeweber"
... and what they do with that control...
This gnupg thread also shows two other witnesses to...
"This project does not allow reviews to be posted."
Now of course back then "Mike Weber" may have been the only one in
the SF GB project, plus the apparent, in my opinion, shills Thomas
and Randolph.
However, you are now also on the SF GB project since at least Oct 26 2013.
So lets see if your project has improved its behaviour since pointed
out by people on gnupg list in Jul 2013... no it hasn't.
To wit: Your project just censored my post and turned on list
moderation so that no one else can speak. Oopsie, footshot ;-)
"1 message has been excluded from this view by a project administrator."
14 out of 15 posts.
"Your mail to 'GoldBug-Forum' ... is being held ... Post to moderated list"
So the question now begs, with you being fully aware, and perhaps
even complicit... why do you remain associated with projects that
have serious issues? If you choose to remain, you definitely need
to get "Mike", and you, to post an answer on this stuff. And if you
choose to leave, an exit statement from you would surely serve you
well as a possible member of the FOSS/Suse community.
As long as all these questions remain unanswered, I will not quit
defending users, or the names of Tor, EFF, CCC.

no one seems to be building any solution at scale within them.

For private personal use that's good as long as it meets
whatever privacy and other needs you might have.
I meant for people to consider deploying such services
for the public. Such that when this question comes up
every month, the standard reply, instead of being riseup
and a few others... would end up pointing to a wiki full of
dozens of alternatives that are friendly to Tor users and
privacy/anonymity seekers.
We see some alternative providers out there, but as with
mail.ru, almost none of them state in writing that they
won't later... decide to lock you out for using Tor proxy
or migrate to requiring a phone or secondary mail.
In other words, they aren't making a defacto support.
I'd bet that mail.ru still accepts mail for those locked
accounts too, instead of properly bouncing them and
letting the holder retrieve the archive and then delete
their account.
So mail.ru just went the path that gmail, outlook
and yahoo went... from being open to being closed.
Just like running a Tor exit relay, there's a lot that
goes into running a Tor/privacy/anonymity friendly
mail (or other) service. We need more of those.
More legit users on more of those might force
the big guys back to the table.

A bad exit is a badexit. If someone's operating a bad family, especially
a widely distributed one, and plays quiet when their name is called on
these lists, I'd sink the whole family and ask questions later. An upstream
could be causing the bad exit, affecting some percent of the family from
0-100, so fault might not be the operator if they were narrow, but they're still
systems manager and hopefully able to fix or cancel the bad exit situation.
Probably have to look at the benefit to the net vs the severity of the nature
of the bad exit and its possible relation to the family and upstream.
A HS email contact is not unreasonable even for silent anon operators.
They can cover any issue in public or in private to badexit as desired
or at least receive reports. And are not the top bandwidth operators of
generally known, leading to not much impact if a sub 20% family gets
k-lined? So probably then safer to sink when in doubt.

reducing node based latency by ensuring relay CPU's

I'd say that depends as some function on the ratio of number of exits
vs non-exit relays, and the destination ratio of all client traffic between
HS and clearnet. The first ratio is just math on intrinsic design and
current relay counts. The second needs input from the clients (as
their horizons are simplest capture point).
I did say "if true". And I get network peaking and headroom.
If there are metrics that show the 90% anecdotes, that's good,
I didn't look beyond metrics first page.
If not, actual provisioned capacity vs usage on relays would seem useful,
even as opt-in submission.
Identifying bottlenecks and balance in code is different from, "we're idling
three cores, and hit two IP's, have bw to burn, let's bring those cores in".
That's ok, until you bring them in and again wonder if you can maximize
what you have.
So exits no longer serve the non-exit relay function?
Or TBB and update HS will construct manual circuits to avoid them?
I'd rather club "no subject"ers than those cross posting as fyi's

FYI -- "it's a surveillance bill by another name." -- Senator Ron Wyden
Go to the following web site; they will connect you to a number of
people at the White House who are getting irritated by so many calls!
Congress Drops All Pretense: Quietly Turns CISA Into A Full On Surveillance Bill
by Mike Masnick
Tue, Dec 15th 2015 9:28am
Remember CISA?  The "Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act"?  It's
getting much much worse as Congress and the administration look to ram
it through -- and in the process, removing any pretense that it's not
a surveillance bill.
As you may recall, Congress and the White House have been pushing for
a "cybersecurity" bill for a few years now, that has never actually
been a cybersecurity bill.  Senator Ron Wyden was one of the only
people in Congress willing to stand up and directly say what it was:
"it's a surveillance bill by another name."  And, by now, you should
know that when Senator Wyden says that there's a secret interpretation
of a bill that will increase surveillance and is at odds with the
public's understanding of a bill, you should know to listen.  He's
said so in the past and has been right... multiple times.
Either way, a version of CISA passed the House a while back, with at
least some elements of privacy protection included.  Then, a few
months ago it passed the Senate in a much weaker state.  The two
different versions need to be reconciled, and it's been worked on.
However, as we noted recently, the intelligence community has
basically taken over the process and more or less stripped out what
few privacy protections there were.
And, the latest is that it's getting worse.  Not only is Congress
looking to include it in the end of year omnibus bill -- basically a
"must pass" bill -- to make sure it gets passed, but it's clearly
dropping all pretense that CISA isn't about surveillance.  Here's what
we're hearing from people involved in the latest negotiations.  The
latest version of CISA that they're looking to put into the omnibus:
1. Removes the prohibition on information being shared with the NSA,
allowing it to be shared directly with NSA (and DOD), rather than
first having to go through DHS.  While DHS isn't necessarily
wonderful, it's a lot better than NSA.  And, of course, if this were
truly about cybersecurity, not surveillance, DHS makes a lot more
sense than NSA.
2. Directly removes the restrictions on using this information for
"surveillance" activities.  You can't get much more direct than that,
3. Removes limitations that government can only use this information
for cybersecurity purposes and allows it to be used to go after any
other criminal activity as well.  Obviously, this then creates
tremendous incentives to push for greater and greater information
collection, which clearly will be abused.  We've just seen how the DEA
has regularly abused its powers to collect info.  You think agencies
like the DEA and others won't make use of CISA too?
4. Removes the requirement to "scrub" personal information unrelated
to a cybersecurity threat before sharing that information.  This was
the key point that everyone kept making about why the information
should go to DHS first -- where DHS would be in charge of this
"scrub".  The "scrub" process was a bit exaggerated in the first
place, but it was at least something of a privacy protection.
However, it appears that the final version being pushed removes the
scrub requirement (along with the requirement to go to DHS) and
instead leaves the question of scrubbing to the "discretion" of
whichever agency gets the information.  Guess how that's going to go?
In short: while before Congress could at least pretend that CISA was
about cybersecurity, rather than surveillance, in this mad dash to get
it shoved through, they've dropped all pretense and have stripped
every last privacy protection, expanded the scope of the bill, and
made it quite clear that it's a very broad surveillance bill that can
be widely used and abused by all parts of the government.
There is still some hesitation by some as to whether or not this bill
belongs in the omnibus bill, or if it should go through the regular
process, with a debate and a full vote on this entirely new and
different version of CISA.  So, now would be a good time to speak out,
letting your elected officials and the White House know that (1) CISA
should not be in the omnibus and (2) that we don't need another
surveillance bill.
In the meantime, if Congress were actually serious about
cybersecurity, they'd be ramping up the acceptance and use of
encryption, rather than trying to undermine it.
Opponents launch 11th-hour campaign to kill cyber bill
By Cory Bennett - 12/14/15 03:54 PM EST
Privacy advocates have launched a last-ditch campaign to block a major
piece of cybersecurity legislation that could soon be added to an
expected omnibus spending deal.
The bill would encourage companies to share more data on hackers with
the government.
Fight for the Future, which has been leading a coalition of digital
rights and civil liberties groups opposing the measure, on Monday
launched an online petition urging the White House to veto the final
legislation.  The group also included a widget that allows people to
call the White House to express their opposition.
Privacy advocates have long argued that the legislation would allow
the intelligence community to collect more private data on Americans.
Technologists and numerous technology companies have expressed similar
But many industry groups, lawmakers and even the White House counter
that the bill is the necessary first step in the fight against
hackers.  Privacy provisions in the measure will ensure personal data
is not shared throughout the government, they say.
"Now is when we'll find out whether President Obama really cares about
the Internet and freedom of speech, or whether he's happy to roll over
and allow technologically illiterate members of Congress break the
Internet in the name of cybersecurity," said Evan Greer, campaign
director at Fight for the Future.
Lawmakers are on the cusp of having a final text ready and hope to
have the bill on President Obama's desk before the year's end.
Negotiators have been working since the Senate passed its Intelligence
Committee-originated bill in October, six months after the House
passed two complementary bills: one from the Intelligence panel,
another from Homeland Security.
On Monday, privacy advocates said that lawmakers had decided to attach
the bill to an omnibus spending bill that is expected as soon as
Monday.  Most observers believe the tactic gives the cyber bill its
best shot of getting through Congress in 2015, as only a handful of
legislative days remain before the upcoming recess.
But several people with direct knowledge of the talks cautioned that
no final decision had been made.
Multiple lawmakers have expressed opposition to the strategy, arguing
that the final cyber text should get a standalone vote in both
chambers.  Their resistance threatens to kill the omnibus strategy.
If the cyber bill does roll through Congress, Fight for the Future
called on the White House to reject the measure.
Throughout the final negotiation process, digital rights groups have
warned that lawmakers were omitting the most stringent privacy
clauses, a claim the bill's backers reject.
"This administration promised to veto any information sharing bill
that did not adequately protect Internet users' privacy, and the final
version of this bill doesn't even come close," Greer said.  "It's time
for President Obama to deliver on his word."

As before, take these issues to the realworld political front.
If you're a coder, you can write all the code you want.
If you're a user, you can use whatever code you want.
If you're EFF/ACLU, you can publish all the press releases
and fight all the cases under already written laws you want.
Yet politicians generally ignore the above groups because they don't
have much if any direct political action component that affects them.
What's needed is a permanent political fixture and operation similar
to the American NRA. These guys have a real, ongoing, political
agenda and impact. Candidates are actually afraid of and responsive
to the NRA's political clout... before they get elected, and before
laws get enacted... not after. The NRA email, fax, letter and call
trees, and their members who visit their legislators and stage in
public view... are very effective. Look at the banner scroller in
the upper right half of their homepage... they have a broad and
deep approach to issue outreach/embedding, even a lifestyle. Labor
unions and others are common examples of such organization. They
all do it by leveraging large monoculture bases to politics.
The NRA is 3.5M - 5.0M members strong. They turn $250M/yr from that
base (manufacturers too). They have little difference of opinion
in their ranks. They are good at crafting and pitching political
rhetoric, framing the conversation, and rendering complex issues
into simple forms that resonate with their entire base.
The EFF/ACLU representing the internet are tiny in comparison. Yet
the internet has a household penetration rate of 70%, more than
firearms rate of 35%... so a big untapped culture there. Finding 5
million (or 2% of population) internet users should be simple task.
Unfortunately, right now there are many tens of flag groups [1]
mostly doing their own thing on the net. That's not good enough,
and is confusingly diverse to both users and politicians. They need
to join together to craft and coordinate the users under a single
general banner they've been subconsciously waiting to fall in line
behind, and then start firing out actionable political things for
them to do.
Internet users could demonstrate solidarity on issues with a typical
Million User March [1]. They need to start raking in money for their
war chest and to fund ongoing operations, etc. Just like the NRA...
doing everything needed to become, and be, a strong integrated
ongoing political force to be reckoned with.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What relay does really help the TOR project? 
It's hard to abstract a top 10 list of hostnames seen into the
concept of discrete users, especially over shared medium like an
exit or NAT point. For example, a site full of href= / src= bling
could yield hundreds of tcp streams per page load of one user, not many.
A ton of bandwidth from one site could just be one user, not many.
And many streams to one site might be a background widget, not
actual clickstream of humans.
Burying your head in the sand and refusing analysis from which to
understand and speak correctly about your network doesn't really
help. I've no objection to exit node research. Only to flawed
research, which is just as bad as making claims without any research
to back them up. If you wish to have a no research policy, that's
fine too, know then you are in no position to say anything credible
regarding what the actual makeup is. Whether that makes the job
of defending and substantiating your network easier or more valid
is up for discussion.

I don't think openvpn supports socks5 on its input yet.
Anyone know of a shim to put in front of openvpn that will accept
socks5 on its input and send to an IP nexthop / interface as its output
(thus making it configurable to point into openvpn)?
Already possible with routing / vm's, but that's a bit
heavyweight just for casual tests of socks5 capable apps.

@_author: grarpamp 
@_subject: [tor-talk] app -> socks5-openvpn -> socks5-tor ? 
privoxy can stuff http over socks, so whether or not this socks to
vpn tool supports http-proxy is moot.
(nb: ip traffic of socks can't be stuffed over http without a far
end de-encapsulator. Same reason why socks provided by SSH won't
work here.)
Not sure it would need to do that, yet one of two things is probably
A) socks5 server code in openvpn itself (like Tor has) so that openvpn
can send it directly through the process and physically out the tun
to the far side, including any DNS lookups on behalf of client.
(Yes, useful :)
B) A standalone shim with socks5 on the front
 1) that knows how to route on the back (in conjunction with setting
    arp to the vpn far end ip, or can talk to the raw tun).
 2) or tell the kernel to ignore the route table for such a socks
    server bound to the tun interface (like dante), combined with
    arp to actually route. SO_DONTROUTE isn't that, SO_SETFIB might.
 Also complicated by the tun interface bouncing up-down and/or it's
 ip address/mask changing. See also policy/source/user/process
 routing, etc. Seems to make B even more complex than VM.
If you're certain your app usage will only talk to a known set of
hosts, simply openvpn with split horizon routing table entries works.
But if you're testing a browser, torrent, bitcoin, something that can
randomly contact anywhere... and you want to use your stack normally
with other apps... you can't default everything into openvpn, so you
need to use the app's socks containment channel. Thus this thread.

Of course the far end happens to be using popular OpenVPN

@_subject: [tor-talk] [onioncat] Paper for OnionCat and Tor New Crypto 
This implies all a network expects and allows its users to do is
browse, and in some strange transport way at that. Nothing wrong
with that, however that's an artificial limitation of what the
network behind it might be capable of.
People need to be clear what they mean by "DNS", "naming", etc. As
a lookup of, or into, something else? As a "human" representation
of something? As something used by the network itself, or by apps
on top of it? Etc.
And note that you don't really need "names" or "DNS" if your apps
or personal notebook perform an equivalent to storing "bookmarks"
of whatever address scheme is in place. TorChat / onion addresses
and bittorrent hashes are managed locally that way.
It has to do with support for apps over some nets that don't offer
IPv6 natively. Not necessarily part of a networks crypto itself.
The notion of IPv6 is that you can immediately plug whatever
preexisting applications you want into those networks. That avoids
needing to write apps from scratch and/or pleading with app upstream
to support your particular crypto addressing scheme, transport
protocol, or usage model. On some networks IPv6 capable apps either
won't work at all, or are partly constrained, which may bring
slower adoption of a network than desired due to users needing
to switch apps into you.
It was a neat (even coincidental) design hack to have one-to-one
mapping between IPv6 and the internal crypto addressing.
If your crypto addressing is wider than IPv6, it's not a loss of
bits to register a map in some auxiliary lookup thing such as a DHT,
it may be possible that it's only there for app support.
If you're a general purpose overlay transport network that doesn't
care about existing apps and wants to force people to expend writing
new apps and wait long time for new app ecosystem to flourish over
it... then any cryptographic "name" (addressing) scheme that doesn't
present an IPv6 address will work.
Some features to compare (my nomenclature sucks)
- native one to one addressing vs a map between sparsely used address spaces
- bidirectional communication using src and dst addresses
- direct existing app pluggability (meaning IPv6 via tun)
- raw IPv6 (not just TCP)
A rudimentary ranking of support for existing IPv6 capable apps
between internal endpoints (roughly better on the left)
Cjdns and Phantom / Tor (Onioncat) / Gnunet (VPN/PT ?) / I2P (Onioncat)
[ No support: native modes of Tor, I2P, Gnunet, and Freenet ]
I may be mistaken as to forum but I think there were also some
threads around IPv6 on forum.i2p or zzz.i2p.

There is a common refrain that he web can never be secure.  Support

Project in late 2014 seems to give support to this idea that security
is impossible.  We must separate fundamental concepts from flawed

without emotional bias, consider if a serious flaw was designed in.

There's certainly no easy solution to all problems. Though
there could be value in those that put more odds in your favor,
even though they do not yield 100% solution or protection.
If you rarely tx but then emit something [unique or timely]
that pops out at some [rare] destination, you're done for.
I think we've seen posts from some people who slow crawl the
web 24x7 when their client is running just to add cover at their
end for their interspersed real web activity.
By the way, does metrics report the saturation level
of the net as a whole in terms of bandwidth and processing
load for exit and non exit relays as both one [and two]
summed aggregate group[s]?
Waste is an incorrect, negative term for designed in padding (fixed
set of lengths) or fill (empty links) or chaff (ratio) or whatever this is.
A design where fill traffic gets out of the way when real data is
being sent might have periods of congestion or underutilization
of the link depending on the distance in hops the fill is managed
over, and the speed of the sensing and feedback controls.
Seems that might need to be as fast as you could initiate a first
packet across, unless you inhibit that packet until ready.
Yes, an individual relay or end node may be subject to various
billing policies (transfer vs bitrate), but see thread in reply to Titov here...
I've said that fill seems useful against passives, not actives.
However a design may actually be possible such that any disturbance
or deficiency in fill might be possible to make up from other sources.
In other words, if I knock you off the net, the remaining path your data
would have taken to your endpoint will still be filled so as not to expose
the far end as being tied to you (if the fill management scope of the
network is finer grained than just the end nodes negotiating end-to-end
with each other (ie: I think the entire net will need to negotiate their own
mesh of fill peers as an underlying management layer, with possible
cues from above)). You get knocked off, your former peers sense this
and recalc their fill sources and sinks.
Well duh, that's necessary :)
While someone's design may be insufficient to solve some problem,
it does add value in the form of talk of possible solutions and trialing
them. Thereby others can try different / related avenues to a solution.
I don't mean that Tor specifically needs to investigate or implement
fill, but that since the research area is probably not complete,
and that no operational net is trying it, it's worth continued work.
If anyone knows a good list that does or would serve as home for
such work, please say so as I'm unaware of any.

years back thus helping to affirm the use case of anonets
by [users of] digital currencies.
And that those running traditional government currencies
usually wish neither privacy or independant currencies,
unless it's for and by themselves.
IBM of course has a digital currency partnership proposition.
Similar issues would apply there as well.

If one thinks that TBB and VM is all that is needed to protect oneself
from random driveby 0day exploits, you need to think again. The
minimum is independant routing into tor via external device. And
even that assumes tor and the device and its stack aren't breakable
or broken. Layer defences, do not use just one.

Longer reply may come, but I think it is useful to again say
that it may be that you must disassociate the classical "tor
centric" idea of fill away from the idea of filling the "tor circuit".
Of course any circuit level fill from end to end will still be visible.
But if the network itself is doing its own node to node fill underneath,
independant from whatever circuits ride on top, there may be

The history of the market is all... Microsoft vs. opensource unix (one
flavor of which was chilled through the 90's by it's parents). Today you
can freely choose what you want and contribute to make it what you
want. Build whatever comp charts you like but there's little difference
between the outward capabilities of FreeBSD and Linux. Another 5-10
years and even that will narrow to just TMTOWTDI, userbases, and
philosophies, of which this partly represent one of them...
GPLers are no different.
GPL could have rewritten BSD parts too, but they evaluate BSD work
and decide to import/keep various parts. That's a real honor to BSD,
especially when there's no license forcing them to do it.
GPL could rewrite the BSD licensed Tor too but they don't ;)
It's all there, go install it.
That's want they want to do, so they do it, and they have a good product
in that area, some say perhaps the best among any current OS (not
that any OS are being independantly audited to test that).
If you can't trust your base, then all your base belong to...
If it requires three cracks to crack three different OS+app combos,
then that's part the reason.
The other part is that Tor and TBB/FF should run on whatever people run
as their OS. That's primarily Win, Linux, BSD. Even on Android and Apple
where not platform prohibitive. You could even make a ChromiumBB if
you wanted to.
If you have access issues, yes, please do.

You should present randomized links to the file beforehand instead

Comment mashup...
Craigslist is relatively unusual in that they do not require an
account to view and reply, or even to post (that is, if users can
figure out what they mean by not needing an account). There is merit
in that usage model.
I'd be curious to know if they're using any antispam discriminator
engines, markov windows, adaptive statistical, bayes, etc. Those
combined with user ham/spam/moderation and captcha seem pretty
efective in email. No reason they can't be applied by typical site
operators whining about "comment spam".
Blocking IP's and phones and emails seems the cheap way out, as
opposed to integrating real protections in depth. To be expected
with todays silly startup business models where everything is an
So when a restaurant has a single external IP rigged into its back
office, floor systems, and free wifi for patrons (a very common
architecture)... yeah, that makes a lot of sense... not.
Tor enables global access for research, that's a good thing. Another
thing Tor users are doing is bravely pushing legal boundaries with
residential exits. Hopefully someday this will result in no more
raids based on silly internet packets.
Good, maybe then we can get the world off the "IP = user" mentality,
while gaining all this human legitimacy to Tor network thus making
people think twice before blocking it.
At the moment, no, not entirely.
The thing with the various unpublished blocking methods of various
websites is that legitimate users don't know how to fit in as good
and privacy conscious participants. Are they supposed to buy a new
phone every month? Stay in a certain city? Etc. Illegit users will
figure all this out. But it's harmful and expensive for the legit
ones who login the next day to only to find some unwritten automaton
rule wiped them out. And with CL, they completely ignore your
They're probably worried about dilution. Has Craigslit ever sued
any other sites that have a similar listing model?
Craigslist seems a bit weird with their users, philosophy, and tech.
Reducing anonymity is definitely not good. The only one who can
truly look out for you is you. The phrase "911 is a joke" exists
for a reason. When you realize this, and begin to develop your own
strength, all of a sudden your own anonymity becomes paramount and
integral to that such that you are willing to accept the other side
having it too. It is one of the great equalizers, with it no one
can rule over you. And "data" wise, certainly not unjustly behind
your back without your consent. Phrase "buddy system" also exists
for reason.
You want damage? How about another form of human rights abuse?
One thing their users do not know is that Craigslist keeps every
single post that has ever been posted on their site forever. Knowing
them, you could assume that means not just the text of post content,
but all the post pictures, related email addresses and phone
numbers... and all the relayed email content as well.
Given all the categories of posts and replies their users make,
this is a thoroughly dispicable invasion of personal privacy...
there is absolutely no legitimate reason for it whatsoever... and
their users are completely unaware that it is going on. That's bad.
Anyway, as far as blocking legitimate Tor users goes, regardless
of who is doing, there's a project here where Tor users are developing
rising up and taking action to make themselves and their wishes
known... but it doesn't appear a lead has been taken on that yet:
Most internet companies are headquartered in big cities where there
are also a lot of Tor users. I'd suggest some of those users get
together to develop a list of interview questions, viewpoints and
examples... and then take an afternoon to go visit the companies
in person to exchange ideas.

If anyone is able to create a new account with Gmail, Yahoo, or
Outlook via Tor without giving a phone number... please log
the exit fingerprint and post here or let me know.
The answer on this for years seems to have been no, or
ambiguously stated, or unverifiable through subsequent testing.
The same thing goes for creation via clearnet without phone.
Supposedly Gmail allows this. Status of Yahoo and Outlook
seem not to have been mentioned or tested lately.
Though irrelavent to potential new users today, Gmail was generally
known to grandfather *old* accounts in regards to both Tor and phone.
Yahoo and Outlook seem unknown there.
The only reason to have any interest in the "big three", is that they
provide a suite of useful free services via one account. That's a valid
use case. Therefore properly testing the Tor/Phone combinations
and publicly pushing them on the issue is important.
The question was "Are [web]mail providers biased against [Tor]?"
AFAIK, those three have not gone on written record explicitly for or
against Tor. You'd need to do more testing above to determine the
situation. They obviously have IP=user blocking / phone issues in
their head whether or not Tor is involved.
There are over 6500 relays and over 1000 exits within tor community.
There's no reason some of those same relay operators, and you, could
not, instead of deploying a new relay, deploy a new Tor and Phone
friendly, even onion accessible, email service. It is clearly a needed
complementary service to Tor. And the more legit people that use such
third tier services, the more you force first and second tier (work / ISP /
school) to accept the principle.
Also, webmail sucks, eats bandwidth and CPU, and is a security
and maintenance risk. No reason you cannot offer only IMAP and
SUBMISSION with your shiny new service. Anyone who can
figure out Tor can certainly configure their mail client.

Yixin Sun, Anne Edmundson, Laurent Vanbever, Oscar Li, Jennifer
Rexford, Mung Chiang, Prateek Mittal
(Submitted on 13 Mar 2015)
The Tor network is a widely used system for anonymous communication.
However, Tor is known to be vulnerable to attackers who can observe
traffic at both ends of the communication path. In this paper, we show
that prior attacks are just the tip of the iceberg. We present a suite
of new attacks, called Raptor, that can be launched by Autonomous
Systems (ASes) to compromise user anonymity. First, AS-level
adversaries can exploit the asymmetric nature of Internet routing to
increase the chance of observing at least one direction of user
traffic at both ends of the communication. Second, AS-level
adversaries can exploit natural churn in Internet routing to lie on
the BGP paths for more users over time. Third, strategic adversaries
can manipulate Internet routing via BGP hijacks (to discover the users
using specific Tor guard nodes) and interceptions (to perform traffic
analysis). We demonstrate the feasibility of Raptor attacks by
analyzing historical BGP data and Traceroute data as well as
performing real-world attacks on the live Tor network, while ensuring
that we do not harm real users. In addition, we outline the design of
two monitoring frameworks to counter these attacks: BGP monitoring to
detect control-plane attacks, and Traceroute monitoring to detect
data-plane anomalies. Overall, our work motivates the design of
anonymity systems that are aware of the dynamics of Internet routing.

That's only if you choose to attempt a padding-across-the-net
management scope, which is also going to be hard and slow to
manage and respond to bandwidth and other net dynamics.
(Though this was about GPA, it's probably also vulnerable to
endpoint interruption attacks that monitor your stream, unless
someone is there making up the padding slack at the far end.)
A wide scope seems hard in a low latency demand based net.
I'd suggest examining some form of next-hop, next-peer, or link
local padding scope negotiated with such peers. If you or your
peers get hit with demand, your negotiation distance is shorter.

Passive adversaries see only encrypted traffic, not internal
wheat/chaff ratios.
(If considering active adversaries, which this is not meant to
defend against, to be involved in ratios they would have to run
enough nodes to be over half the full path, no worse than basic
entry to exit correlation today.)
Internet access is generally provisioned and billed as... choose
the max bandwidth you want, pay for it whether you use it or not.
Therefore if you have idle capacity within your max at some moment,
you have the bandwidth to dynamically fill it with padding at no
additional cost. It's not a question of buying more to use as fill,
it's about intelligently filling what you've already comfortably paid for.
The problem of observing when endpoints are sitting idle, or rx/tx,
and how much, often, etc... applies to any network today, not just tor.
It doesn't take a supercomputer to calculate this
regarding your logical link to your next hop node...
100Mbps cap - 63Mbps used = 37Mbps fill
That's head in sand talk, of course nothing is free.
Mostly bookkeeping autonomously on and by the local node.
Maybe some circuit signaling / publishing to DHT.
Seems to get more complex if you try to scope
it across the net instead of just to your next hops.

There are folks running scripts to detect various things, you
can find some of that in git. Some is driven by exitmap.
If you find some exits that are doing something you can
script against, feel free to post your work.
You can report malicious relays here where people may pick it
up, look into and confirm it and get them pipelined for banning as
needed. There are a couple of badrelays pages on wiki that may
interest you further.
Citizen prosecutors are not something many countries permit,
it's not in the interest of the state. Tor Project itself has no
history of reporting such relays, but you can report any
confirmed malicious nodes to whatever authorities you wish
and hope they take it up under whatever digital crime laws
they may have. Keep in mind that many malicious nodes
are operated anonymously, and that many prosecutors are
clueless or busy with other things like victims and paper
violations in their own jurisdictions. Odds are you're not a
victim with standing in their jurisdiction, unless you start
playing with mapaddress or geoip to do that.
It's probably more effective to report them here, get
them confirmed and banned by dirauths, and even report
them to their hoster. It's certainly quicker than the courts.
Given there's no contractual relationship, it would be
interesting to see if a relay could seek tort or free speech
or something against tor for banning them, while at the
same time not being liable for whatever it was they were
doing in their local jurisdiction.

              The user's app gets a TCP close or reset or stack times out.
There might be an option someday for that, but there's already
a 'new identity' button to do it manually.
Over half the exits support modern SUBMISSION, msmtp.sf.net
would easily test this (with fetchmail or mpop testing pulls)...
wc -l /tmp/25 /tmp/465 /tmp/587
      40 /tmp/25

     522 /tmp/587
sort /tmp/25 /tmp/465 /tmp/587 | uniq | wc -l
     547
It's worth looking into. I'd guess the percent of exits actually
affected would be quite low. Tier-n backbones don't subscribe
to such things, and last hop ISP's are too small to effect much.
Ie: Many exits and their users would repeatedly notice and report
that some /etc/service was being globally blocked in front of their
exits, mark the hoster (end ISP) on the goodbadisp wiki, etc.
I'm not aware of such quantity of reports. It could also be
that exits are testing their own exit's view first, and moving to
another hoster without reporting if their view sucks before
their exit has time to be used by users.
Other than the web page docs an in-protocol message is a
good notification place too.
Let's see if whoever on tor-talk wants to pick this up as something
to be tested for as a project, then consider what the results mean.
Perhaps for any given "service / app" there will be a certain global
level of utility, less than which exits might then be recommended to
try to resolve it, relocate, or deconfigure that service in torrc.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Desired exit node diversity 
Guessing that... assuming you can ship and calculate all the relay
data / DHT / weights / KEX / circuits / preferences without
bogging down your network or cpu...
More relays being exits yields higher maximum possible path diversity.
More relays being exits yields higher potential aggregate throughput
between the network and clearnet.
More exits yields broader more complete location overlay relavent to
users (more relays yields more guards), datacenteres, and clearnet
services (though there's as yet no attempt to exit near a service
unless done manually).
However when subject to global passive adversary tapping
lots of the fiber, and you turn up more relays as exits (which
are also non-exit relays by nature), you're adding lots more
unused bandwidth over the same current consumption, leading
to lots of unused quiet portions of the network.
Which seems a greater potential for the adversary to "look, user
just shot a unique traffic pattern completely through the quiet
zone, gotcha".
Whereas when the network links are full with clocked traffic
(and fill traffic if there would otherwise be slack space) that
observation attack is hardly as possible, to relavently impossible.
If true, it seems to me adding more [non] exits should be pegged to
some metrics and solicited on need / planning rather than turning
up 6000 exits all at once.
tor-relays had talk of individual humans keyparty signing their relays
and including that WOT along with other trust and meta metrics
in the consensus or other queryable datastore that could be used
by the user to select preferred relay sets in whichever sensible or
silly ways suited them.
An adversary standing up relays has costs.
Adversaries standing their human agents in public, even if
their undercover is maintained, has additional costs and risks.
In a sense this is like the original 'valid' flag, which you got
by mailing me and having me manually approve your relay (and without
which you would never be used as the entry or exit point in a circuit).
Periodically I wonder if we should go back to a design like that, where
users won't pick exit relays that don't have the "socially connected"
badge. Then I opt against wanting it, since I worry that we'd lose
exactly the kind of diversity we need most, by cutting out the relays
whose operators we don't know.
But both sides of that are just guessing. Let's find out!
These type of things may be better suited to a system
where the users contribute their research and knowledge
about the network into the network metadata db, and the
users can query it to make their own decisions, follow
other users prebuilt selection templates, or stick
with the provided defaults.

REVIEW OF STRATEGIC APPROACHES
Option 1: Disavow Legislation and Other Compulsory Actions
Engagement Strategy and timeline
Z September: Outreach to foreign allies to signal our strong
resistance to efforts to compel access; outreach to U.S. industry, the
technology community, and civil society to coordinate messaging;
attempt to convince other allies to come out with a similar statement
at the same time.
Z October: The President issues a statement strongly disavowing
legislation or other efforts to compel access and calling on U.S.
industry to resist efforts by other nations to compel access;
coordinated industry and civil society statements of support;
coordinated foreign partner statements of agreement.
Z November: Outreach to other governments to bring more allies in
alignment with our position; outreach to U.S. industry to build
voluntary cooperation in the absence of compulsion; host public
discussions and debates on encryption policy with U.S. industry and
foreign allies.
Top Line Message
Z The problem of criminals using strong encryption to frustrate law
enforcement's information gathering is a real and growing problem but
we have not found a secure, practical solution.
Z People around the world rely on the security of U.S. products and
services in their daily lives.  Mandating the design of those systems
to include known vulnerabilities makes all of us less safe and
undermines trust in these digital services.
Z It is critical that law enforcement be able to access the
information that it needs to protect public safety and national
security.  We will continue to use all of the tools available to us
lawfully to keep American citizens safe.
Z Overall, the benefits to privacy, civil libertine, and cybersecurity
gained from encryption outweigh the broader risks that would have been
created by weakening encryption.
Z Accordingly, the Administration will not seek legislation that
compels providers to design their products to enable government access
to encrypted information, even pursuant to lawful process.
Z We expect that foreign governments will also take a hard look at
this difficult issue, and hope that they will come to the same
conclusion.  We call on U.S. industry to resist efforts by other
governments to mandate such access.
Impact on Policy Equities
Public Safety and National Security.  In the near term, this approach
would not provide any relief to law enforcement efforts to counter the
increasing use of encryption by criminals, including terrorists.  As a
result, the public safety drawbacks would be significant, though the
precise extent of the drawback versus other proposals is unclear
because bad actors will increasingly be able to frustrate law
enforcement efforts to access their communications through lawful
process.  This approach would remove technology companies' most
consistent grievance with the Administration, which could improve
cooperation across a range of important priorities on technology
issues including, but not limited to, encryption.  It may also foster
better cooperation on information that is not encrypted and will not
fracture the Internet products and services market which may also
preserve better access to unencrypted information, thus aiding public
safety/national security.
Cybersecurity.  Pro-encryption statements from the government could
also encourage broader use of encryption, which would also benefit
global cybersecurity.  Further, because any new access point to
encrypted data increases risk, eschewing mandated technical changes
ensures the greatest technical security.  At the same time, the
increased use of encryption could stymie law enforcement's ability to
investigate and prosecute cybercriminals, though the extent of this
threat over any other option is unclear as sophisticated criminals
will use inaccessible encryption.
Economic Competitiveness.  This approach could help undercut foreign
competitors' criticisms that U.S. companies' products are instruments
of U.S. mass surveillance, and would clearly differentiate U.S. policy
from moves by China and others to mandate decryption.  However, if
other markets do not follow our lead, and instead demand access, it is
more difficult to assess the impact of this approach.  On the one
hand, U.S. companies could be forced to avoid those markets or develop
access solutions.  On the other, the failure of some nations to follow
the U.S. lead could bolster the reputation of the United States as a
leading source of technically secure products and.  services.
Civil Liberties and Human Rights.  Domestically, many privacy and
civil liberties advocates would regard this approach as a significant
step in defense of privacy and free expression around the world.  If
other nations follow our lead or companies successfully resist country
demands, this approach could limit repressive regimes' willingness to
demand access to encrypted information, which likely would help
protect dissidents and other communities in danger of human rights
Likely Reaction of Key Stakeholders
Industry and Civil Society.  This sector would strongly support this approach.
Other Governments.  Likely to be divided.  This position would
contradict the stated policy of some allies (e.g., the United Kingdom,
France, and the Netherlands) who argue that governments should not
allow ?safe spaces? for extremists.  As a result, those allies could
criticize the U.S. position as endangering the safety of their
citizens.  Other foreign partners that are strong advocates for free
expression online and have not argued for government access to
encrypted information (e.g., Germany and Estonia) are more likely to
support this approach.
Z Some in industry have indicated that a strong statement disavowing
legislation is a precondition to voluntary cooperation with the United
States Government.  Since the prospects of legislation are dim, this
approach could help build cooperation without limiting broader policy
Z Counters the narrative that the United States is seeking to expand
its surveillance capability at the expense of cybersecurity, and could
help repair trust in the United States Government and U.S. companies
Z A strong statement from the United States could make it more
difficult for authoritarian regimes to seek compulsory legislation,
although working group participants are divided on whether adopting
this approach would actually stop such calls.
Z May weaken future calls for data localization since it will be
harder for other countries to claim they are ?protecting? their
citizens' data from the United States.
Z Could provide some positive benefit for U.S. negotiations on the
U.S.-EU Data Protection and Privacy Agreement, Safe Harbor, and
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
Z Is the strongest option for cybersecurity, economic competitiveness
and civil liberties and human rights.
Z This approach provides no immediate solution to the challenges that
the expanding use of encryption poses to law enforcement and national
security today and is the weakest option from that perspective.
Z Some working group participants argue this approach would remove a
key point of leverage -- the threat of legislation in our negotiations
with industry (although few, if any, in industry likely find this
threat to be credible).
Z U.S. providers have not indicated they would be willing to
voluntarily modify their systems to enable law enforcement access to
encrypted information, even if the government were to eschew
legislation, and could result in the United States being isolated in
its position.
Option 2: Defer on Legislation and Other Compulsory Actions
This option could be pursued with two distinct goals in mind.  Under
option 2(a), the Administration would seek industry's voluntary
assistance to modify their technology to address law enforcement's
concerns.  Under option 2(b), the Administration would accept the
current status quo and not seek technical modifications, but would
still ask providers to assist law enforcement in any way that they can
within their current technological framework.  In either case, these
calls for assistance could be done publicly or privately, depending on
the preferred engagement framework.
Engagement Strategy and Timeline
Z September: Outreach to foreign allies to assess their positions;
signal to allies that the United States does not think legislation is
the right way forward at this time; work with other governments to
identify voluntary action by industry that would help to mitigate
their concerns; outreach to U.S. industry to coordinate messaging.
Z October: The President issues a statement disavowing legislation,
but acknowledges the serious challenges posed by encryption for public
safety and national security; secure coordinated statements of support
or agreement from industry, civil society, and partner nations.
Z October-November: Outreach to foreign allies in the wake of the
statement to bring more allies in alignment with our position;
outreach to U.S. industry to build voluntary cooperation in the
absence of compulsion; if some allies persist in demanding access,
consider whether the United States Government should highlight the
difference in positions and the U.S. emphasis on privacy-protections.
Z Post-November: Host public discussions on encryption policy with
U.S. industry and foreign allies; should foreign allies demand and
secure access, consider whether to call upon U.S. industry to provide
the same access to the United States Government.
Top Line Message
Z The United States is not seeking legislation at this time to compel
providers to change their products to enable government access to
encrypted information pursuant to lawful process.
Z At this point, legislation appears neither feasible or easily
draftable.  We need considerable public discussion before we would be
in position to contemplate a legislative solution.
Z However, we also cannot ignore the barriers that inaccessible
encryption can create to law enforcement's critical need to
investigate and prosecute criminals, including terrorists -- and the
threat these barriers create for public safety.
Impact on Policy Equities
Public Safety and National Security.  Does not reverse the long- term
trend of increasing use of encrypted technologies by criminals, but
could open potential avenues for cooperation with industry, without
removing all law enforcement leverage (although working group
participants disagree on whether calling for legislation will provide
meaningful leverage).  Some working group participants, however, have
indicated they think it unlikely that industry will be willing to
voluntarily modify their technology -- even if the threat of
legislation is removed.  This suggests that Option 2(a), in which the
Administration would seek such technical modifications, is unlikely to
succeed.  However, unlike option 1, it retains flexibility on the
approach should the public safety picture deteriorate to overtake
competing equities.  This approach would also make compromise with
foreign governments not currently seeking legislation easier, but
would still provide some help in resisting attempts by
 governments like China to use encryption policies to skew markets or
oppress citizens by retaining strong public statements (e.g., ?will
not seek legislation?).
Cybersecurity.  Could encourage the use of more encryption, which
would likely be good for cybersecurity.  If a statement under this
approach is perceived as positive but not sufficiently strong,
however, this could be less successful in forestalling other nations
from pursuing encryption-weakening measures.  Also, because any access
point to encrypted data increases risk, if government efforts to
secure access are successful, this approach would reduce
cybersecurity.  However, the degree of impact on cybersecurity would
vary significantly, and could be great or small, depending on the
specific policy and technical decisions.
Economic Competitiveness.  Could have a positive, though incomplete,
effect in removing barriers to Administration engagement with the tech
sector on this issue.  Removing the prospect of United States
Government calls for legislation would likely have positive effects on
international competitiveness.  If long-term successful in gaining
government access, this option would significantly harm economic
competitiveness though the harm might be somewhat mitigated if there
was broad international success in getting government access.
Civil Liberties and Human Rights.  Some will be dissatisfied with lack
of outright disavowal, but may appreciate the pragmatic recognition of
the practical limitations of a mandated approach.  However, others
almost certainly will continue to have concerns about government
access to encrypted information being used to suppress dissident
populations.  Should some companies cooperate voluntarily and enable
government access, the United States Government will need to accept
that other nations -- including some repressive ones -- will use this
access as well.
Likely Reaction of Key Stakeholders
Industry and Civil Society.  Although industry and civil society may
be less positive to this approach than a hardline disavowal, those
communities would likely see this outcome as a solid win.  However,
further government pressure on industry to build access into their
products would likely generate negative reactions.  Therefore, it is
likely that Industry and Civil Society would have a much better
reaction to Option 2(b), which does not seek technical modifications,
than to Option 2(a), which does.
Other Governments.  Allied governments that prefer an access regime
may push back on the core U.S. message.  However, those governments
likely would react more positively to this approach than a complete
disavowal of government access to encrypted information.
Z Responds to a key ask from industry, although industry might prefer
a stronger statement.  To the extent that industry is satisfied with
the strength of the statement, this approach could help build
cooperation without limiting broader policy options.
Z Could help counter the narrative that the United States is seeking
to expand its surveillance capability, and help repair trust in the
United States and U.S. companies overseas.
Z Could allow the United States to serve as a broker between
pro-access allies (e.g., United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands),
and U.S. industry, which could mitigate some demands from foreign
partners and ensure U.S. companies do not have to build multiple
access regimes.
Z If long-term successful in gaining government access, this option
would help public safety and national security.
Z Could lead to disparate approaches by governments to the encryption
issue, leading to more or different compliance regimes that U.S.
companies will need to comply with, which could have a negative effect
on their economic competitiveness.
Z Does not provide an immediate solution to the challenges that the
expanding use of encryption poses to law enforcement.  Without a
disavowal of legislation, many U.S. technology companies in the long
term likely will not pursue voluntary design changes in products and
services to enable access for law enforcement.
Z If long-term successful in gaining government access, this option
would harm cybersecurity, economic competitiveness and civil liberties
and human rights.
Option 3: Remain Undecided on Legislation or Other Compulsory Actions
Engagement Strategy and Timeline
Z September: Outreach to foreign allies to assess their positions;
Private outreach to key industry leaders to argue that we need a more
fulsome policy discussion before we decide how to proceed.
Z October: Organize or participate in closed-door, small group
discussions with U.S. industry to facilitate a more in-depth policy
discussion.  At the same time, organize bilateral and multilateral
conversations with foreign partners to discuss the challenges and how
to proceed.
Z November: High-level Administration statement highlights initial
discussions, outlines key challenges, distills a few key questions and
principals, and announces a meeting or series of meetings (potentially
both domestic and international) to discuss and debate these key
Z December: After the discussions, reassess our position and determine
whether to take a position on encryption legislation or to continue to
call for discussion.
Top Line Message
Z The President has said that there is no situation in which you
wouldn't want strong encryption.
Z At the same time, there are situations in which the government
cannot obtain information related to a specific potential national
security threat.  If there is not a way of accessing that information
and protecting the American public, then the Administration believes
need to have a public debate.
Z Having a broad discussion about this is essential -- over the next
several months, [we or several entities] will host discussions on the
challenges posed by encryption and how we can best address them.  I
would urge everyone to participate.
Impact on Policy Equities
Public Safety and National Security.  This approach has, to date,
failed to incentivize cooperation with law enforcement.  It could in
the long-term sway public opinion to create greater responsiveness --
particularly while the government retains the leverage resulting from
the threat of legislation.  On the other hand, silence on our part
could encourage foreign governments to control the agenda.  They might
pressure U.S. industry to provide lawful access, which, if successful,
would make it easier for us to require similar accommodations.  This
approach could also encourage companies to continue to aggressively
pursue developing inaccessible encrypted services, and could make
future cooperation significantly more challenging.  Therefore, it is
hard to predict the impact that this approach would have on public
Cybersecurity.  Although it would not actively conflict with our
message on the importance of encryption to cybersecurity, the
uncertainty of public perceptions about the government's position
could perpetuate distrust in encryption technologies related to the
United States Government, and could undermine the effectiveness of the
National Institute of Standards and Technology and other entities at a
time when our cybersecurity agenda is already at risk.  If long-term
successful in gaining government access, this option would harm
cybersecurity.  -
Economic Competitiveness.  This approach does little to counter
current distrust of the government by industry or foreign competitors.
Further, by not taking a position on legislation in either direction,
this approach does little to shape the reactions of other governments,
increasing the risk that they will splinter into multiple camps,
presenting U.S. industry with fractured markets.  Therefore, this
approach is likely harmful for economic competitiveness.
Civil Liberties and Human Rights.  Because this approach would likely
not stop -- and could encourage -- other nations from demanding
access, it is likely harmful for the Administration's efforts on civil
Likely Reaction of Key Stakeholders
Industry/Civil Society.  Will likely continue to strongly object until
the United States Government explicitly eschews compulsory
legislation.  As time passes, if we continue to fail to take a
position, industry and civil society positions will likely harden as
people perceive our silence as an implicit endorsement of legislation.
As a result, the United States Government risks losing credibility if
it fails to participate robustly in a public debate and with a unified
voice.  There is also a risk that industry chooses not to participate
in meetings on the subject and escalates lobbying and public relations
Other Governments.  Allied governments that seek access will prefer
this approach to either of the approaches that come out against
compulsory legislation, and will likely see this as an opportunity for
them to press for legislation themselves.
Z Provides flexibility to course correct and negotiate with U.S.
industry and our foreign allies.
Z Retains a key negotiating chip (the threat of legislation) in our
engagement with industry (although few, if any, in industry find this
threat credible).
Z If other governments call for legislation and/or compel companies to
change their encryption solutions to enable better access in the
meantime, this could provide us with cover to use that same access.
Z Delays establishing a coherent Administration position, which could
result in: (1) the United States being portrayed as increasingly
ineffective/unable to resolve this challenge; (2) disputes among
departments and agencies bleeding out into public discussion; (3) U.S.
industry continuing to have challenges operating overseas (although it
is unclear that a pro-encryption statement would by itself address
this challenge); and (4) public and foreign government positions may
harden in the absence of an affirmative U.S. position, limiting our
ability to influence the global debate.
Z Does not provide an immediate solution to the challenges that the
expanding use of encryption poses to law enforcement.  Moreover, this
approach does not resolve the current policy debate.  The United
States Government likely will be faced with this same discussion again
in several months' time.

Amici Curiae by EFF and ACLU
A Philadelphia man suspected of possessing child pornography has been in
jail for seven months and counting after being found in contempt of a court
order demanding that he decrypt two password-protected hard drives. The
suspect, a former Philadelphia Police Department sergeant, has not been
charged with any child porn crimes. Instead, he remains indefinitely
imprisoned in Philadelphia's Federal Detention Center for refusing to
unlock two drives encrypted with Apple's FileVault software in a case that
once again highlights the extent to which the authorities are going to
crack encrypted devices. The man is to remain jailed "until such time that
he fully complies" with the decryption order. The government successfully
cited a 1789 law known as the All Writs Act to compel (PDF) the suspect
to decrypt two hard drives it believes contain child pornography. The All
Writs Act was the same law the Justice Department asserted in its legal
battle with Apple.

A corporation can be issued, issue, and hold, various licences and
certs, be they from or to, private or public entities, governments,

bid / let [govt or other] contracts, provide services, etc.
Use your imagination. TPI knows what it does or doesn't hold. And
TPI can be transparent by listing them all proactively instead of
requiring community go on phishing expedition for them by name.
TPI has surely asked folks to fill out or sign, and been asked
itself, regarding NDA's / [de]briefings, pre / during / post
employment blanks, template blanket MOU's, etc.
Use your imagination. TPI operates a corporate "office", a corporate
office has form blanks for all sorts of uses. In particular when
liasing with or initiating new parties of all types.
As with the "new docs" someone posted for the future, folks are
interested in seeing any similar docs applicable to the past.
Only TPI knows what they were named. Those of employment and
[process] acknowledgement are certainly higher than stupid petty
cash and phone memo forms, come on now :)
No, the state mandated Articles and Annuals exist there.
NO!, the bylaws (another name for operating agreement), a highly
relavant thing for transparency, do not seem to exist anywhere.
Whatever other major structural and procedural docs may exist, who
knows. Those are just some of the common names for them. Other
people can add other names.
Worth nothing is that whether or not any doc is [required to be]
filed with government agencies, and whether or not it is publicly
available from them once filed... is different from what TPI may
choose to publish on its own for the community.
Regardless, whatever is publicly available or FOIA-able on a
government site should also be posted for transparency on TPI as
It's not necessarily clear, in a classically hierarchical org chart
sort of way, who held all the various high titles and when.
NO!, voting and election does not appear to be detailed at all anywhere.
Only opaque references to "duly elected" and "adopted".
And "member" often means certain things in corporate law as well.
While "non-profit" (its own curiosity to be sure), may hold certain
meaning and requirements in certain jurisdictions, the extension
of that to concepts of founding / holding parties and redistribution,
optionally to achieve "non-profit", may be different.
Links to law refs on the topic could be useful for those that didn't
already notice a reference to the possibility of that in the Articles
(under powers).
Pointless when the AOI says nothing there, and the bylaws aren't
available. Nor can community be expected to wade through MA/US law
to see if any particular "Officer" or "Director" is granted unwaivable
voting rights under law.
If TPI's release of particular docs is governed by requirement of
law, that's different. But if community can FOIA same from govt,
there is no such requirement, and TPI should transparently publish.
No user, donor, or interested party should be pushed / required to
go private fora like that. It's their right to ask in public, to
do so by proxy person or tor etc, and to retain their motivations.
And whatever TPI does with such requests is up to TPI. If it's
transparent with servicable open fora, it's a non issue.
It's also silly to be fielding multiple same requests when a single
transparent proactive publication of same will serve everyone.
Yes, minutes are very important for transparency.
It's extremely unlikely the ED's office did not know, or was not
informed, within no more than a few days of the request, probably
more like a few hours. Certainly not a few weeks.
Few could have problem with that.
As before, only with lack of ack and general plan of reply.

These are all basically spying, but they are useful and there are
always those who research or publish them freely for others to use.
Sure, legit researchers (by whatever standards) might heed
discouragement, but it's important to remember that others have
not since the day onions were first invented. That's why I always
say users should use stealh or application level authentication
until then and take precautions. Even after.
How do you say leaking DNS is "soon [made] impossible" by anything
tor does? ie: tor itself already never leaks what is sent to its socks5
port. Any such leaks come from user config and usage errors in their
userland with their userland apps and packet filters.
If you're talking TBB, that's something different.
Other things like Whonix are not tor.
Custom spidering used to do a very good job here. Though growth
broadened what could be effectively found and targeted that way,
and targets are dropping out all the time as usual. So researcher
and search portal discovery delay is now longer and the depth
shallower. It's at the point you're better off buying a google search
server and plugging it in.

On the command line or config file, currently, in r570? No.
Excluding tunnel setup it's in src/ocat_netdesc.h.
Go ahead and add the -option if you want, seems useful.
Make sure you check the rfc and document your prefix
generation, some of the example scripts out there are
also wrong, and I believe the current prefix is unreproducible.
There's also a voluntary registry of sorts.
I think you'd end up with a "private" network via breakage,
though it seems hardly a security feature without end
to end keying / packet filtering. See also -U and -R.
I could see ocat expanded to recognize a list of known
prefixes where you'd handle each differently in the host
stack (via interfaces, or even subinterface / vlan presentation)
even though they're all backhauled over a -t tor.
Today that would require running multiple onioncats
with no way to multiplex the prefixes over a -s.
You probably know about this thread spanning months
where people interested in onioncat...

@_subject: [tor-talk] IPv6 /48 for OnionCat 
If your users are the masses, yes. In a private install / userbase
you could pick anything that doesn't collide in your stacks,
and then anything that hasn't been allocated via rfc / registry,
which is almost the entire /128. Use filters, not rely whatever isp
do or iana docs say.
Well you would bind apps to the ipv6/128 on the tun interface,
onioncat takes care of routing that /48 among tor's onions
after the hosts routing table sends its packets to the tun.
Basically yes.
Then there's the sick stuff you could do with
Try verifying glob_id.txt.
There's that, but there's also potential of making onioncat
daemons keying together so people can key at whatever
layer works for them. ie:
clearnet - ipsec, vpn
tor / i2p - network instances ie: dirauths, bitcoin genesis
onion / eep - hsauthcli / ?
onioncat / garlicat - tbd
ipv6 - ipsec, vpn
application - x509 cert pinning
Socks5 port is a bit different from onion p2p.
I meant having single onioncat handling multiple /48's would give another
abstract management option, in addition today multiple onioncats with
one /48 each.

If a user wants to participate in my /48 and mir's /48,
one daemon, config file, etc could be easier. As might filter
rulesets matching on interface.
Assuming no other protection, and learning the onion via some method,
such as other public services or DHT snooping, port 8060 is but one TCP
connect away. A locally generated private /48 adds avg 2^47 guesses to that.
Both of above may be hypothetical but you never know what
users will come up with or like to do. Though multiple /48 is
much more work than just an option to set a single /48.
In that context, it's "not a broadcast network".
Arp for IP on ethernet is analogous simply syn check 8060
on tor+onioncat, both deal with the "up" and the address.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fwd: "Welcome to London!" aka, 
A technical reading of the ?HIMR Data Mining Research Problem Book?
3 February 2016
Boing Boing just released a classified GCHQ document that was meant to
act as the Sept 2011 guide to open research problems in Data Mining.
The intended audience, Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research
(HIMR), is part of the University of Bristol and composed of
mathematicians working for half their time on classified problems with
First off, a quick perusal of the actual publication record of the
HIMR makes a sad reading for GCHQ: it seems that very little research
on data mining was actually performed post-2011-2014 despite this
pitch. I guess this is what you get trying to make pure mathematicians
solve core computer science problems.
However, the document presents one of the clearest explanations of
GCHQ?s operations and their scale at the time; as well as a very
interesting list of open problems, along with salient examples.
Overall, reading this document very much resembles reading the needs
of any other organization with big-data, struggling to process it to
get any value. The constrains under which they operate (see below),
and in particular the limitations to O(n log n) storage per vertex and
O(1) per edge event, is a serious threat ? but of course this is only
for un-selected traffic. So the 5000 or so Tor nodes probably would
have a little more space and processing allocated to them, and so
would known botnets ? I presume.
Secondly, there is clear evidence that timing information is both
recognized as being key to correlating events and streams; and it is
being recorded and stored at an increasing granularity. There is no
smoking gun as of 2011 to say they casually de-anonymize Tor circuits,
but the writing is on the wall for the onion routing system. GCHQ at
2011 had all ingredients needed to trace Tor circuits. It would take
extra-ordinary incompetence to not have refined their traffic analysis
techniques in the past 5 years. The Tor project should do well to not
underestimate GCHQ?s capabilities to this point.
Thirdly, one should wonder why we have been waiting for 3 years until
such clear documents are finally being published from the Snowden
revelations. If those had been the first published, instead of the
obscure, misleading and very non-informative slides, it would have
saved a lot of time ? and may even have engaged the public a bit more
than bad powerpoint.
Some interesting points in the document in order:
    It turns out that GCHQ has a written innovation strategy,
reference [I75]. If someone has a copy it would be great to see it,
and also understand where the ACE program fits in it.
    GCHQ, at the time used heavily two families of technologies:
Hadoop, for bulk processing of raw collected data (6 months for
meta-data apparently), and IBM Streams (DISTILLERY) for stream,
real-time, processing. A lot of the discussion, and open problems,
relate to the fact that bulk collection can only provide a limited
window of visibility, and intelligence related selection, and
processing has to happen within this window. Hence the interest in
processing streaming data.
    Section 2 is probably the clearest explanation of how modern
SIGINT works. I would like to congratulate the (anonymous) author, and
will be setting it as the key reading for my PETS class. It summarizes
well what countless crappy articles on the Snowden leaks have
struggled to piece together. I wish journalists just released this
first, and skipped the ugly slides.
    The intro provides a hit at the scale of cable interception
operations as of 2011. It seems that 200 ?bearers? of 10 Gigabit / sec
were being collected at any time; it makes clear that many more
sources were available to switch to depending on need. That is about 2
Terabit / sec, across 3 sites (Cheltenham, Bude, and LECKWITH).
    Section 2.1.2 explains that a lot (the majority) of data is
discarded very early on, by special hardware performing simple
matching on internet packets. I presume this is to filter out bulk
downloads (from CDNs), known sources of spam, youtube videos, etc.
    The same section (2.1.2) also explains that all meta-data is
pulled from the bearer, and provides an interpretation of what
meta-data is.
    Finally (2.1.2) there is a hint at indexing databases (Query
focused databases / QFD) that are specialized to store meta-data, such
as IP traffic flow data, for quick retrival based on selectors (like
IP addresses).
    Section 2.1.3 explains the problem of ?target development?, namely
when no good known selectors exist for a target, and it is the job of
the analyst to match it though either contact chaining or
modus-operandi (MO) matching. It is a very instructive section, which
is the technical justification underpinning a lot of the mass
surveillance going on.
    The cute example chosen to illustrate it (Page 12, end of 2.1.3):
Apparently GCHQ developed many of those techniques to spy on foreign
delegations during the 2009 G20 meeting. Welcome to London!
    Section 2.2.2 provides a glimpse at the cybersecurity doctrine and
world-view at GCHQ, already in 2011. In particular, there is a vision
that CESG will act as a network security service for the nation,
blocking attacks at the ?firewalls?, and doing attribution (as if the
attacks will be coming ?from outside?). GCHQ would then counter-attack
the hostile sources, or simply use the material they intercepted from
others (4th party collection, the euphemism goes).
    Section 2.2.3 provides a glimpse of the difficulties of running
implants on compromised machines: something that is openly admitted.
Apparently ex-filtrating traffic and establishing command-and-control
with implants is susceptible to passive SIGINT, both a problem and an
    Section 3 and beyond describes research challenges that are very
similar with any other large organization or research group: the
difficulty of creating labelled data sets for training machine
learning models; the challenges on working on partial or streaming
data; the need for succinct representations of data structures; and
the problem of inferring ?information flow? ? namely chains of
communications that are related to each other.
    It seems the technique of choice when it comes to machine learning
is Random Decision Forrests. Good choice, I also prefer it to others.
They have an in-house innovation: they weight the outputs of each
decision tree. (Something that is sometimes called gradual learning in
the open literature, I believe).
    Steganography detection seems to be a highlight: however there is
no explanation if steganography is a real problem they encountered in
the field, or if it was an easy dataset to generate synthetically.
    Section 4, deals with research problems of ?Information Flow in
Graphs?. This is the problem of associated multiple related
connections together, including across types of channels, detecting
botnet Command and Control nodes, and also tracing Tor connections.
Tracing Tor nodes is in fact a stated problem, with a stated solution.
    Highlights include the simple ?remit? algorithm that developed by
Detica (page 26, Sect. 4.2.1); PRIME TIME that looks at chains of
length 2; and finally HIDDEN OTTER, that specifically targets Tor, and
botnets. (Apparently an internal group codenamed ICTR-NE develop it).
    Section 4.2.2 looks at communications association through temporal
correlation: one more piece of evidence that timing analysis, at a
coarse scale, is on the cards for mining associations. What is cute is
the example used is how to detect all GCHQ employees: they are the
ones with phones not active between 9am and 5pm when they are at work.
    Beside these, they are interested in change / anomaly detection
(4.4.1), spread of information (such as extremest material), etc. Not
that dissimilar from say an analysis Facebook would perform.
    Section 5 poses problem relating to algorithms on streaming graph
data. It provides a definitions of the tolerable costs of analysis
algorithms (the semi-streaming paradigm): for a graph of n vertices
(nodes), they can store a bit of info per vertex, but not all edges,
or even process all edges. So they have O(n log n) storage and can
only do O(1) processing per event / edge. That could be distilled to a
set of security assumptions.
    Section 5.2.2 / 5.2.3 is an interesting discussion about
relaxations of cliques and also point of that very popular nodes (the
pizza delivery line) probably are noise and should be discarded.
    As of 2011 (sect 5.2.4) it was an open problem how far contact
chaining is required. This is set as an open problem, but states that
analysis usually use 2-hops from targets. Note that other possible
numbers are 3, 4, and 5 since after 6 you probably have included
nearly everyone in the world. So it is not that exciting a problem and
cannot blame the pure mathematicians for not tackling it.
    Section 5.5.1 asks the question on whether there is an
approximation of the correlation matrix, to avoid storing and
processing an n x n matrix. It generally seems that matching
identifiers with identifiers is big business.
    Section 6 poses problems relating to the processing, data mining,
and analysis of ?expiring? graphs, namely graphs with edges that
disappear after a deadline. This is again related to the constraint
that storage for bulk un-selected data is limited.
    In section 6.3.2 the semi-streaming model where only O(n log n)
storage per vertex is allowed, and O(1) processing per incoming event
    Appendix A deals with models of academic engagement. I have to say
it is very enlightened: it recognizes the value of openly publishing
the research, after some sanitization. Nice.
    Appendix B and C discuss the technical details and size of the IBM
Streams and Hadoop clusters. Section D presents the production
clusters (652 nodes, total 5216 cores, and 32 GB memory for each
    Section E discusses the legalities of using intercepted data for
research, and bless them they do try to provide some logging and Human
Rights Justification (bulk authorization for research purposes).

giving all 0/0 or some unpredictable IP range you dig up over to

I previously wrote in archives that exit relays could bind OpenVPN
to extra IP's they configure on their exit relay boxes. Tor daemon
has nothing to do with those IP so they never appear in tor's easily
blacklistable consensus. Users then OpenVPN over tor to those via
use of the relay fingerprint to reach vpn terminator IP over relay
localhost to save bandwidth, and on out to clearnet.
You can OpenVPN to some list of onions if you don't feel like listing
the relay fingerprints / extra input IP's on wikis. But it's not going
to stop dedicated blacklisters, and onion doubles bandwidth use.
However it could also be used by non-exits that for whatever reason
didn't want to be a tor-exit but did want to offer exit via some
remote third party vpn service. And strictly social sharing on
forums etc could happen for distribution.
There are already some exits that for various reasons, intentional
or other, do not exit from their OR IP. That is a feature that some
tor users do now find and use. And relays don't offer OpenVPN yet
which would also give users more than just IPv4-TCP exit scheme.

offering model with false.i2p and a few other nodes.

In ATM the cost was unfilled buckets... here, filling them

Tradeoffs may also have sweet spots and asymmetric scales.
The other meaning of "fast load" vs "$cost" is of bandwidth / bytes
choices of the user to their ISP which is another topic and never "free".
Hiding participants to a communication from each other, negotiating
their own encryption over the path, and confounding vanilla hop by hop
backtracing by police level jurisdiction based authorities. That's mostly it.

Tor is fundamentally a tunneled circuit based encrypted network.
It was designed roughly 15 years before Snowden's confirmations
and before 911 in a time when networks were still mostly trusted
and GPA's effectively spying at scale much less attacking were only
in the minds of crackpot cypherpunks.
Tor's circuit design probably doesn't lend itself to fill traffic / management,
and bolting it on the side may be non ideal. (Those are open questions.)
Yet "Tor" without its original design model could hardly longer be called
Tor (or TOR) at that point.
If you want fill traffic, you're probably better off forking and gutting
it, or starting something completely new that incorporates ideas
from knowledge both inclusive and post Tor's design.
Tor is great at what it does well, which is a lot.
You just have to know what that is, and find (or make
in it or elsewhere) what it isn't good at.
You'll be dead by then. It's more fun to risk dying now ;)
Tor is looking at some forms of network fill traffic, which may
or may not be integrated to the entire network wide sense, or
useful in your own designs...

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fwd: [Cryptography] A possible alternative to TOR and 
This is an old idea, but perhaps now there might be more reason to
consider it.  I currently call this idea Alias.  Here's my dumb
data-dump on it.  Thoughts?
Alias is a concept for a TOR-like Internet protocol supporting free
speech and user privacy, but without encouraging the worst evil
behaviors.  Exit Nodes are replaced with Public Gateways, which
sponsor users.  The definition of evil behavior is defined by the
Public Gateways and operators of routing nodes.  Users would be
encouraged to use good behavior, as their public alias would develop a
reputation over time.  Anonymity would be protected, but a user's
Public Gateway and any routing node could refuse to route data for
aliases with poor reputations.
TOR was created with a lofty goal: to support free speech.
Unfortunately, TOR has drawn attention from governments and law
enforcement, as it could be used to protect some of the worst
activities, such as contract killing, and the slave trade.  TOR Exit
Node operators generally follow a strict policy of never looking at
traffic, because simply observing this traffic would require Exit Node
operators in most countries to regularly contact law enforcement to
report crimes.  PrivaTegrity is an alternative protocol to TOR, which
aims to find a balance between protecting free speech and protecting
the world from the worst behavior.  Unfortunately, the PrivaTegrity
inserts encryption backdoors.
Alias Design:
This is very much a dumb idea in the half-baked stage.  Feedback and
ideas are welcome.
Alias would be a fork of TOR, and route Internet traffic from a user's
machine through a couple of Routing Nodes, to a Public Gateway, which
replaces the Exit Node.  The Public Gateway would have an account for
the user, under a pseudonym used on Alias network by the user, called
his alias.  The Public Gateway should keep an email contact address
for the user, similar to regular accounts on various web sites.
In Alias, user aliases would have trackable reputations, and the
reputations of user aliases would be combined into a reputation for a
Public Gateway.  At a minimum, incident reports would be used to
compute user reputations.  Exactly how this works is TBD, but the goal
is to cause gateways with very poor reputations to be effectively
blacklisted by routing nodes, and for users with poor reputations to
be dropped by reputable gateways.  Users could move their alias from
one gateway to another when needed, but they could not erase what
their previous gateway knows about there identity.  The Gateway would
not know a user's location, and in many cases will know nothing other
than the user's reputation and email address.  When requested by a
government authority, at a minimum, a gateway can drop support for a
user alias, causing that alias to try to find a new gateway that will
agree to sponsor it.
Participants who act as routing nodes in Alias would be able to select
what sort of reputations they require from aliases and Gateways to
allow traffic to be routed through them to those gateways.  They
could, for example, choose to not route data for any gateway with a
high reputation for routing to pornography sites.
I compare the TOR, PrivaTegrity, and Alias concepts in several "threat
cases" below:
Threat Case: Governments Overreact to Terrorism
In this case, we assume all the governments involved have decided to
share all user network traffic in a mass surveillance program.  The
user Alice has something to say, such as wanting to tell the world
that the mass surveillance program exists.
TOR:  Alice succeeds in using TOR to log into various blogging sites
and publishes her knowledge about the surveillance program.
Unfortunately, TOR provides limited defense against the Men in Black
(MiB), and Alice may be arrested.  The MiB is assumed to compromise
TOR in various ways, such as operating many Exit Nodes and monitoring
meta-data such as packet timing and size between nodes.
PrivaTegrity:  With the assumption that all governments involved are
colluding, Alice is revealed directly, without having to subvert the
Alias:  Alice needs a Public Gateway to sponsor her.  She can choose a
gateway with a reputation of sponsoring free speech, such various
newspapers, in a country that is not participating in the mass
surveillance program.  When Alice posts what she knows to various
blogs, the Public Gateway (newspaper in this case) will be the the one
defending her anonymity.  In any case, even if the newspaper is forced
to reveal what they know about Alice, they never knew her location.
Conclusion: Alias seems to provide better protection of free speech in
this case.
Threat Case: A Single Government Blackmails the Rest
Suppose one of the governments involved decides to use it?s influence
in the protocol to blackmail one or more of the other governments
involved into agreeing to some political agenda.
TOR: If the government were the USA, it might have unique powers to
track users through the TOR network.  If true, the USA could refuse to
reveal a French suspected terrorist unless the French government share
mass surveillance data collected on it?s citizens.  Is this sort of
thinking too paranoid?
PrivaTegrity:  With nine separate governments who must collude to
expose a user, it is possible for any one of the nine to blackmail the
rest.  For example, if tracking down a particular user is of critical
importance to one government, another could demand certain trade
policies be agreed to before allowing that user to be revealed.
Alias:  A country containing the Public Gateway sponsoring a user
might make political demands from another country before agreeing to
force the Public Gateway to reveal a user?s email address.  However,
this coercion is weaker than weaker than the TOR case because there is
no country with majority control, and weaker than the PrivaTegrity
case because a government can coerce cooperation only from Public
Gateways in its country.
Conclusion: While none are immune to this threat, Alias seems to
perform better in this case.
Threat Case: Hackers Compromise the Network
In this case, a group of hackers wants to reveal the identity of a
particular user.
TOR: There is little chance that the attacker can hack all the nodes
from the user to the Exit Node, and since the Exit Node has no
information about the user, there seems to be little chance that the
hacker can reveal the user?s identity, short of bugs in the protocol.
PrivaTegrity:  While hackers might hack one or more of the nine
governments, it would be a considerable task for the hacker to hack
them all.  However, it is possible, and this is a weakness vs TOR.
Alias:  The hacker need only hack the user?s chosen Public Gateway,
which is a considerably simpler task than with PrivaTegrity.
Conclusion:  Hackability of Public Gateways is a significant weakness
for Alias compared to the other two.
Threat Case:  Evil Users Secretly Collude
In this case, suppose there is strong evidence that several evil users
wants to collude to do something terrible, and they want to
communicate anonymously.  For example, they could be running a
contract-killing business or enslaving people and selling them on the
Dark Web.
TOR:  Unfortunately, evil behaviors have been enabled in some cases over TOR.
PrivaTegrity:  The users involved in such evil activities can have
their communication secretly wiretapped.  This is a strong capability
for law enforcement in this case.
Alias: Assuming reputable Public Gateways are used, most of the users?
emails would be revealed to law enforcement.  This is weaker than a
Conclusion: In the case of severe evil, PrivaTegrity performs the
best, Alias next best, and TOR the worst.
Threat Case:  Somewhat Evil Users Secretly Collude
What is evil vs good is highly subjective, and getting people to agree
can be difficult.  In this case, the users are engaged in what most
reasonable people consider evil.  For example, consider illegal trade
in ivory, which could lead to the extinction of wild elephants.
TOR:  Users trading in ivory likely would benefit from using TOR.
PrivaTegrity:  Having to get cooperation from nine governments may be
too painful when tracking down a single ivory trader, and the ivory
trader likely could use PrivaTegrity to their advantage.  If, on the
other hand, the nine governments put in place a rapid rubber-stamp
process to enable going after small-time criminals, then this
capability can be highly abused.
Alias:  Ivory traders would avoid using Alias through reputable Public
Gateways, since their identities could easily be revealed? and the
sites the traders visit to buy/sell ivory would not likely be very
reputable, lowering their alias' reputation.
Conclusion: Alias seems to perform better at determine somewhat evil behaviors.

Did you just push a bunch of packets over time into your ISP and
have google send replies back? Well, they can see both ends, so
they saw that traffic pattern in and out, and back in and out, so
they know who's talking to who and when.
In addition to simple taps, they can also deploy passive or
active nodes in any of these networks at will. And use all
the tools to perturb things in favor of their efforts.
Tor and other networks are good at hiding endpoints (users, servers)
from each other, keeping traffic content encrypted over the wire, letting
you anonymously publish and consume stuff among other users that
isn't really of interest to (against) such adversaries (and thus won't get
you killed or jailed or disappeared (but will still get you databased
for life)),
and getting around some censorship. That's probably about it.
However when it comes to such global (and regionally lucky) passive
adversaries, and adversaries operating the networks themselves, I
seriously doubt anyone can say with a straight face that these
networks protect against network analysis... who is talking to
who and when.
It would be harder for that analysis to succeed against networks
that filled between all the nodes with fill traffic when unused and
not needed for user traffic. (And in the sense of Tor, between clients
and some number of guards). But that's hard to design so that it
is functional. And no one in the overlay network / messaging field
really seems to be trying it. Mindset, OMG bandwidth, probably
buzzkills most research before it gets started.
Here's some recent mostly tor specific threads if anyone's interested,
plus whatever else has come up whenever I've mentioned this.

general feel in their countries and locales and areas of expertise

That would be useful to get an early start in the spamming / seeding

There's no need to 'mirror' or 'clone' or 'set up a site', the good ones
are just transparent cleartext proxies, one onion in front of another.
They can be timed, but don't fall to the dynamic content and
update differences that mirrors do.
Regardless, the last step is publication of the proxy. This is done in
wholesale on onionland services such as forums and the now tens of
wannabe 'hidden wikis', many of which are run by the same actors,
obviously adding to the attack surface. Users surf them, they and the
links looks legit, they get bookmarked and that's that till they somehow
find out. It's been going on that way for years. All onionland services
should be considered suspect, even email, syndication and storage.
Exit rewriting is an easy way to skim another fraction of users without
needing to play with forums and wikis.

doesn't do its advertised functions. Instead it drops complex malware
onto the system that subverts the security of the system, allowing it
to be used as part of a botnet or to spy on the owner. "This type of
malware is particularly dangerous as it's hard to detect and offers
the attacker full control of the compromised system," said Tiberius
Axinte, Technical Leader, Bitdefender Antimalware Lab. "For instance,
someone can lock you out of your laptop, threaten to blackmail you to
restore your private files or transform your laptop into a botnet to
attack other devices. The possibilities are endless." The malware,
dubbed Backdoor.MAC.Eleanor, sets up a hidden Tor service and
PHP-capable web server on the infected computer, generating a .onion
domain that the attacker can use to connect to the Mac and control it.
Once installed, the malware grants full access to the file system and
can run scripts given to it by its masters.A report on AppleInsider
says that malware can also control the FaceTime camera on a victim's
computer. But thankfully, Apple's Gatekeeper security prevents the
unsigned app from being installed.

That's a bit sideways, but in the interest of sideways eventually
moving forward...
1) Funding of sorts, which spreads around, to develop TBB, a sizable
prioject, to do decent things a browser should do, hopefully feeding
back to Mozilla. Were certain elements of security left uninvestigated
and just punted to Whonix+FF, well that's a incomplete partial approach
too. If you want funds, you might not want to publish other partial solutions.
Securing the browser and browser meta is a fine project.
And as has been said, it's still needed to pair the app with
defense in depth and a known line around application land.
Just remember TBB and Tor are not and cannot be that line.
2) Captured audience dependency. As with publishing,
this is corporate 101. Giving someone an app is well...
welcome to apps, and a torbox to run them on. Like
iTunes on iPhone.
Giving someone unix is like airdropping a great big box

I never liked those statements. I don't expect the user to know
why I or we don't, that takes an investment. But at least give
them a damn link right there alongside them that says
"Learn about the limitations of Tor" or something similar,
out to a nice open wiki page on the subject so they can start.
Not just "Learn more about Tor" out to an overview containing
a tiny "staying anonymous" section with no links, docs or
text to further support itself.
Even in there "fast enough for web browsing" is a bad qualifier.
Creating concise correct current text that holds up to parsing
is work, and there are degrees involved. But in a leading "privacy"
and "anonymity" app with certain remarked use cases beyond
surfing example.com all day, not doing so as an integrated
project component is kinda unexcusable.
Interesting to note that because former reasonably well
known and accepted decades of humanitarian investment
by some of these states has been reinvested into decades
of things like drone strikes... it makes it harder for projects
like Tor to freely make the case that their project existance
and use case is even valid for human rights and so on when
states are trending bashing those rights and their validity.
Right of anonymity and privacy, let alone legal and technical
extant versions of same, seems a very tenuous thing. And the
latter especially, is not something you can just brush on a

18 July 2016
Cloudflare reCAPTCHA De-anonymizes Tor Users
A sends:
Cloudflare's insistence on solving reCAPTCHA puzzles when visitors are
coming from Tor exit nodes to one of the 2 million web sites that
Cloudflare 'protects' can be very instrumental for traffic analysis
and de-anonymizing of Tor users.
This is how:
The only non-public prerequisite for the de-anonymizing entity is the
ability to monitor traffic between ISPs and Tor entry nodes, and
traffic entering Cloudflare servers (no decryption required in either
case). There are, of course, no 2 million Cloudflare servers, probably
there is no more than few hundred.
Each click on one of the images in the puzzle generates a total of
about 50 packets between Tor user's computer and the Cloudflare's
server (about half are requests and half are real-time responses from
the server.) All this happens in less than a second, so eventual
jitter introduced in onion mixing is immaterial. The packet group has
predictable sizes and patterns, so all the adversary has to do is note
the easily detectable signature of the "image click" event, and
correlate it with the same on the Cloudflare side. Again, no
decryption required.
There likely are many simultaneous users (thousands), but they do not
solve puzzles at the same time, and they do not click on the puzzle
image at the same time. Simple math shows that disambiguating is
trivial. If there is some ambiguity left, Cloudflare can conveniently
serve few more images to specific users (or even random users, as long
as within the same few seconds different users get different amount of
'correct' images.)
This obvious opportunity is not the proof, but NSA would have to be
utterly incompetent not to be exploiting it. No one is that

A new report published by the European Union Intellectual Property
Office identifies a wide range of 'business models' that are used by
pirate sites. The organization, which announced a new collaboration
with Europol this week, signals Bitcoin and the Tor network as two key
threats to ongoing anti-piracy efforts.
To avoid enforcement efforts, pirate sites often go to extremes to
hide themselves from rightsholders and authorities.
Increasingly, this also means that they use various encryption
technologies to increase their resilience and anonymity.
Several of these techniques are highlighted in a new report published
by the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO).
The report gives a broad overview of the business models that are used
to illegally exploit intellectual property. This includes websites
dedicated to counterfeit goods, but also online piracy hubs such as
torrent sites and file-hosting platforms.

Researchers have speculated that GCHQ may have the capability to
deanonymise Tor users by examining the timing of connections going in
and out of the Tor network.
there is clear evidence that timing information is both recognized as
being key to correlating events and streams; and it is being recorded
and stored at an increasing granularity. There is no smoking gun as of
2011 to say they casually de-anonymize Tor circuits, but the writing
is on the wall for the onion routing system. GCHQ at 2011 had all
ingredients needed to trace Tor circuits. It would take extra-ordinary
incompetence to not have refined their traffic analysis techniques in
the past 5 years. The Tor project should do well to not underestimate
GCHQ?s capabilities to this point.
one should wonder why we have been waiting for 3 years until such
clear documents are finally being published from the Snowden

True regarding physical or network compromise of nodes,
however that is single purpose and not very efficient attack.
Instead, this is traffic analysis by GPA's and cooperating GPA's.
They have their illegal, unethical, multipurpose mass surveillance
network taps all over the planet. Even if your path was from Canada
in (to Venezuela to China to Russia out) to Mexico, they don't have
to have taps in any of those countries, only on transit that has
visability of the IP's / points of interest, typically just the endpoints.
There's nothing you can do about it but
- start researching and using networks that use fill traffic
- shut down those GPA's and their activities against you
It is those out of control self aware self preserving entities

Perhaps different terms for same derivative thing?
Fill traffic needs store and forward with random delay, for low latency
requirements it could be called reclocking with jitter, rearchitecting
for higher latency adds additional bounds on time to the interval
and jitter clocks. Packet / message oriented / UDP seems useful
to remove constraints of TCP-in-TCP allowing for management
of fill traffic, multipath traffic spreading, pluggables, and so on.
Ineffective is say rearchitecting web "services" to deliver a tarball
of a website for offline reading, if said delivery is over a traditional
non fill network, it will be TA'd.
Fill / chaff seem needed, otherwise in an all wheat network,
input traffic on one side seems to match output traffic on the
other side at some point, regardless of storage / delay.
Fixed packet sizes seem to help.
Fill ratios up to 100% utilization can mask the wheat.
Minimum fill is amount needed for plausible deniability
that single input can't be mapped to a single output.
ie: 10MiB in, must have at least two outputs that
received 10MiB.
Is there any group / list that is actively researching
or developing such networks? Or that wants to?

What does this help / enable?
Nodes are known to GPA's, there is no way to hide them.
If GPA counting physical packets, over time period, bytes into a
relay must equal bytes out, otherwise they're being dropped
somewhere, which is inefficient... as opposed to temporarily
reducing fill to cover wheat demand.
There is up to %50 capacity loss with random sizes,
requiring up to 2x higher packet / interrupt rates to compensate
within the same pipe / cpu. And the code to do all the
carving, queuing and reassembly of every single packet, more
complex and costly than padding the last carrier packet
of some layer.
There is also to consider...
- physical / logical paths and pathing
- circuit, packet, label, or flow switching
- what layers the fill is in (above, at, or below wheat),
the layers managed at, and by who.
Big challenge is figuring how the network self
manages the fill system to dynamically make room
for wheat demand wherever it is needed in the network.
(That dynamic is also what makes the user apparent
application performance roughly the same as non fill
networks. Of course their NIC (or their configured
anonymous network rate limit within that), is always
saturated, but that's transparent to the application
If that's all solved fill traffic might be a good defense to
Global *Passive* Adversary, and even a fair one to a
Global *Traffic Flow Perturbing Active* Adversary.
(What evidence is there that Global Adversaries
that are not partnered with Global Telecoms are able
to, as opposed to simply listening, arbitrarily drop /
inject / delay packets on the global backbones?)
Designing something new, including fill, crypto, and anonymity...
probably far harder than putting tor's basic design together was.
On the other hand, there's now 15 more years of research,
experience and components on hand to throw at it.

On global backbones...
Inject / drop / delays require a complete fiber cut and insertion
of active hardware capable of selecting traffic. A carrier that
cares about such things must not ignore their line diagnostics.
If you had insane alien tap tech capable of precise timing,
invading wavelengths, and faster-than-subject-fiber processing
and transmission... dropping could be done without cut by laser
corrupting CRC / addresses with gain hits or losses, whiteout, etc...
injection is similar, delay is drop and injection.
Adversaries couldn't do sneaky blackbag shit to the fiber
if carriers would encrypt all their links, like Google now says
it does internally.
All bets are off if the carrier is partner with, or under threat of,
adversary... regarding global telecoms (remember Qwest),
this paragraph seems the most likely of all the above.

"never exits" - GPA's don't necessarily need to correlate any internal

traffic that lights up some other endpoint, in an otherwise sufficiently
quiet network, or distinguishable way (bytes / latency [pump], which is

You need fulltime regulated fill traffic, within which, your traffic resides.

Govt seems to have no issue doing such illegal / unethical things.
And they certainly can use their own network, tor, to do it.
This is suggested often on tor-talk. And tor devs continually

Not really. Tor already loads GeoIP. So 20 or so lines
of code and you've got a separate country for
each hop. A few more lines to define groups like
FVEY / BRICS, hemispheres, regions, AS, etc.
Users could isolate on whatever they wanted.

way it raises the cost and risk to adversaries who

As a minimal tool for small users of a few torrents.
It scales worse than the combo Tor + Onioncat UDP + Transmission,
plus opentracker forming initial meetup space to prime into PEX / DHT.
Which people are also using right now today,
entirely within Tor, and linked to some other networks
via other tunnel interfaces which I won't bother to detail here.

link against library for this net, library for that net, deal with Tor's
stupid lack of anything but TCP transport, talk socks5, not

Leads to social balkanization and one-net specific apps like
each darknet creating dinky little private tools like Snark.
Not knocking i2p / snark, knocking lack of vision and cooperation

If that's the old "OMG, too much" argument... load re anon overlay nets
may be more like bitcoin's interrelated variables... difficulty, txfees, reward,
watts, price, txrate, etc... they'll slide nicely around to compensate until
some unsolveable fundamental limit is reached. ie:
Private (non-exit/I2P) use of these nets... if they slow, users will start
talking urging more nodes, which they'll readily deploy themselves since
private is low risk and satiates their use case. If the required node count
to support n-million users starts blowing up CPU/RAM, devs will
start getting poked to work on layering that. Even parallel nets
with usage charters may arise by then as a given networks adversary
resistance begets users begets trust begets honoring narrower charter.
Besides, load happens to useful nets, no point trying to stave it off
(nets are anon so staving is a no anyway), and trying to stave makes
the stavers look stupid.
A little education helps too, users will self regulate if they sense that,
"Oh shit, I know this net is used for , but I can't
even get my own  through, so I better ease up on variable ".

design side...
Some [officials] within torproject will decry traffic, and have even
gone so far as to suggest they'll deploy coded countermeasures
(which since the traffic is anonymous, and the code is opensource,
doesn't work and kills someone else's good as well). In the end,
just like video on clearnet, users and their traffic will come, and
utilize whatever capacity and features they can, nothing you can
do about it.
A more qualified thought... I find ongoing intentional exclusive
use of exits so people can basically get their trivial entertainment
LOL's using filesharing apps such as bittorrent (or any other use that
is known to tax networks)... to be rather immature to unethical.
However I do see fine use in performing initial import of clearnet
datasets via exits (if maintaining anonymity of such import action is
necessary), provided they then cut their clients over to run exclusively
within the anonymous networks. (In the case of bittorrent, that
means disconnecting the split horizon network path to clearnet,
swapping out clearnet trackers for trackers within the anonymous
overlay networks, using PEX / DHT within those nets, and possibly
managing running two instances over various datasets.) ie:
Someone might import the latest opensource unix iso's via clearnet
without use of exits, then cut and seed exclusively via anon overlay nets.
Same person might need to import the latest political leaks and
civil rights videos via exits, then cut and seed similarly.
I agree that linking the various overlays, features, services, and users
together is generally a good thing. I tend to argue IPv6 for that since
so many of todays apps and users speak that. However there's certainly
other shims, proxies, and addressing stacks people can dream and
code up, particularly for asynchronous / non-real-time messaging and
file like storage services.
Users also need to research and think clearly about any security
and privacy impact using such links may have on them.

This has always been my position. Each user of these "free"
community powered networks has an impact. For some nets
this has readily calculable minimums, like tor and its 6x minimum
for exclusively non-exit (HS) use. Other nets or usage models
may be roughly estimated. Therefore each user of such networks

The EFF reports that a federal court in Virginia today ruled that a
criminal defendant has no "reasonable expectation of privacy" in his
personal computer (PDF), located inside his home. The court says the
federal government does not need a warrant to hack into an
individual's computer. EFF reports: "The implications for the
decision, if upheld, are staggering: law enforcement would be free to
remotely search and seize information from your computer, without a
warrant, without probable cause, or without any suspicion at all. To
say the least, the decision is bad news for privacy. But it's also
incorrect as a matter of law, and we expect there is little chance it
would hold up on appeal. (It also was not the central component of the
judge's decision, which also diminishes the likelihood that it will
become reliable precedent.) But the decision underscores a broader
trend in these cases: courts across the country, faced with unfamiliar
technology and unsympathetic defendants, are issuing decisions that
threaten everyone's rights.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor funding 
Tor actually does have an individual donation component.
Though it doesn't yet go into statistics about number and
size distribution of transactions for each funding method,
there's at least some level of breakout in the annual report
and filings.
Tor has an element of "can't teach old dog new tricks", or
at least "we're moving, slowly..." the Tor dog has received
a lot of "compromised" (from some minds or global perspectives)
money. Some principals in tor grew up in certain spheres of work,
for which say, writing proposals for, and getting, government grants,
is what they're good at. Contracts bids are of course more one
sided than bilateral interest work or grant requests. Public sector
work / careers (Government, University) are just naturally that way.
Others are good at courting large private foundations / NGOs,
some of those not everyone would agree on either, and some
possibly funded in turn by similar objectionables.
Maybe some of this needs to be thrown out to some sort of
community approval model. Maybe a growing percentage moratorium
on objectionables, and such a stand up announcement, is part of that.
Some even say remove all the program outreach money to a
separate entity. With other folks just coding for BTC.
Balancing and transitioning is hard.
Maybe tor just got "lucky" here, who knows.
One thing that should be thought about is any undue mass effect,
and how to help other projects in the space [1] that are small or
lack the above historically conjoined funding talent and sources,
yet whose code, ideas, and papers are seen as important / competing
work, or have been used by larger projects.
Monopolies in any field are usually not a good thing, so you want
to be quite careful about creating or sustaining them.
And continually reevaluate, as a process, if what you're funding
and coding is still worthy of your efforts.

Years ago there was a thread about some of the words and phrases
used on the website were not the best. Especially given knowledge
of what tor was both good and not so good at on a technical level
(such as good against the ISP office snoop, and poor against GPA).
A few on the list made suggestions on updated verbage to put on front
page, download page, etc. It's also hard finding conciseness that works
with "dumb". There weren't any blockers, it just fell by everyone's wayside.
I've always wanted to see, for instance on the download page,
with links to the wiki for more details...
"G. Tor does not present a solution to GPA threat model."
"S. Use your apps within a Sandbox (VM's, Whonix, Qubes,
Unix Jails, packet filters) that is then only allowed to talk to Tor).
Something more about users actually using it to engage in
free / political / apolitical speech, controversial topics.
And of course everyday activities like markets, darknet social,
comms, general hacker hobbying in onionland, so on.
The current descriptions and use cases go back quite a way...
Now in 2016 we know a lot more about, and have more
real experience with, various threat models and Tor.
Perhaps now is a good time for interested people to put
some work into this as a real subproject and actually

@_subject: [tor-talk] [onioncat] Onioncat v2 
This goes to two things...
- the usage models you expect
- the usage models you want to enable
Let's keep in mind that the fundamental strengths
of onioncat and reason that it exists are...
- tor and other anonymous overlay networks often do not
support full IP semantics, with tor it's TCP only, which
cripples or eliminates certain apps.
- anonymous overlay networks often do not support
interfaces to the traditional IP stack of OS's, with
tor it's onion only, which you can't bind(2) to, except
via hack within the tor daemon... which only does tcp,
which doesn't route, or packet filter, or VM, or...
"NO" ... well, that's fine for individual people who
meetup elsewhere and personally agree to exchange
keys and addresses (or find such listed on the web, etc)
in order to communicate. It scales only to the extent
one can personally manage it, and it is not oppurtunistic
as far as making random new introductions.
"YES"... this is where the real potential lies. Lots
of apps are p2p, or at least rely on central servers
to tell them of their peers in real time. Bitcoin and
bittorrent are purely p2p with peers coming in via
the network itself at random. VOIP could be thought
to be central yet random. This list of non-manual config
apps is really long. Then evaluate which are popular
in the opensource space whereby they're possibly
not run by popular centrals like facebook, but by
community (XMPP), or strictly p2p.
It seems that NO would still serve a purpose and thus
would be a call to making an onioncat v2. And that YES
would be a very interesting project that needs to look at
many potential solutions some of which people post ideas
about on list.
Yes if it is available, or willing to be developed and integrated
by the overlays for such use.
For example, it may be possible that the [transmission] bittorrent,
and cryptocoin, communities might see a reason to run something
separate if it gave them p2p access to anonymous transport layers.
Public usage is all in supply, demand, and advertising.
Private usage has seen some successful onion/i2p like
what.cd [nee i2p/onion] membership.
Evaluating the needs of some VOIP and messaging
protocols re IPv6 UDP and tun interface might be useful.
We already know bittorrent needs udp and trackerless p2p
to be efficient.
Another way to think is... can the overall utility of anonymous
overlay networks ever grow if they continue to be restricted to,
say, TCP and their own proprietary addressing stacks?
Are there RFC type proposals to interoperate / expand that among
the community of overlay networks?
And is onioncat a good place to enable that if either are no?

However it's also not something to just ignore.
A "Red", for all the reasons it may occur good or bad, should
still be investigated before using tor. Even if all that means is
that you hit "NEWNYM, new circuit / identity, whatever the button
for that is in TBB" and try for green again before assuming
your setup works and then surfing the net. If you get all red's,
or even more than a percent of all exits, that could be a real
problem to ask about.
I've been trying to get a blurb to the effect that "red may happen
on occaision, please read some wiki faq link and try again" added
to the check screen.
Unlike the ORPort IP, tor [operator] simply may not have bound
any [scannable] ports to the actual resultant exit IP.
"Quality Score" is something different and not on primary topic.

We want the accounts, without phone.
Then I want graduated service enablement based on human
pattern heuristics... participation, length of time, kbd / click data,
backoffed captcha intervals, bitcoin deposit with automatic
return schedule, user realness ratings by other users, etc.
These have real and rather unprogrammable / rising costs
to illegitimate users / bots.
For such services, I want canceling of accounts, not canceling of IP's.
[Another silly example... a site that denies credit card
via tor (well, that's plausible, sortof, barely, not), but then
also offers and denies bitcoin payment via tor too. Just
because they didn't think or bother to put in the extra two
lines of code to permit the latter. (Or they laughably think
they need to know provenance of coin to kiss regulation
that doesn't exist.)]
The top sites in every category all have staff and budget
that could implement some levels of this, they just don't.
Because in my opinion, they don't give a shit. Their brains,
singularly and collectively, are programmed to be and act
negatively "how can we reject", not positively "how can we
include". How can we design / buy / sell hardware and software
to exclude and block. Etc. Which also means they don't
tend to listen to users. Or bother with nice things like "hey
you're one of 500 accounts we nuked via IP, if we got you
wrong, login here and tell about it".  It's old school top down
kill focused and at the earliest stage.

When the options are everywhere, and it's not really costly
whether in amortized dollars or performance, the use cases grow,

moot and you turn it on by default.

Quantity, perhaps. But there's lots of work to make what they

I already wrote about that elsewhere re diversity.
No need, plenty of new users to collect. Of course some Tor ones will
come along for the ride.
Yes, underutilization is a problem, especially for anonymity
networks that require utilization to deliver claimed properties.
Tor has plenty of both, so the next step is to get off tor lists and get
on to the next size list.
No ivory tower needed to build stuff, though UX can't be ignored.
TPO is doing tor.
I2P offers exit services. Its users can operate exit nodes.
Using the feature is more like choosing proxies or vpns
and requires some setup vs being integrated like tor.
Exactly like how I outlined tor exit operators could run openvpn
terminations to provide other-than-TCP-exit-only service,
and IP block dodging. I don't expect tor to do either anytime soon.

It's one approach, and forking is valid per license, so cannot complain.
 It's really no different than anything here.
I'd support any Independant Onion project, same for any non onion
project in the field.
Not really. Discriminating human from bot, is different than human
from human, and nym from IRL, and good from bad. You're right,
I'd be quite careful when selecting which of many tools to use
to help enable access for users of these nets.
We know the whitepapers tell us some of these systems have
enough bits^2 to do that. That researchers are collecting and
making anonymized statistical analysis from live systems. And
we know there are deployments of same or similar ideas for those
exact purposes in places from advertising to NSA.
What's more revolting than it happening, is that users aren't
being told by those who are doing it that it's happening.
Depends on the context.
"Authenticated to a weak level" ... no. Well, correct user:pass is at
least minimally authenticated (AAA meaning), regardless of other
layers inside. But in the nym space we must respect wish not to
authenticate to IRL, that from the user perspective, they have valid use
of the service contexts that do not require it, and for which it is bad.
Which your quote does not seem to consider, but more like the
concept of "levels" of bitcoin exchange authentication to IRL.
Which may be useful there, but not in context of nym.
Users are to blame too.
Though at this early stage we probably have to say that masses
dl'ing app from bank are probably not same class of user installing
anon / overlay networks.
With a bit of training, an entry level helpdesk junkie can review and
nuke an amazing amount of genuinely bad accounts. I'd suggest the
big corps can afford to dedicate a junkie or two to similar tasks,
under recognition that IP blocks alone take out good with bad.
They'll have to dedicate anyways, exactly as they have to clearnet,

Nothing to you.
Yes, users are frustrated with current methods.
Probably because they can see at least some other
more finegrained options out there that aren't yet being used.
It's not as if legit users are wrong for simply wanting to
use a service, even anonymously so. It's interesting
if they are pushing their use case, whether or not they
can yet articulate it in disciplined manner to CEO.
Even the esteemed tor project doesn't really have a
division dedicated to helping users do this. And they
assassinated and lost some voices in the speaking circuit.
If the CIO/CSO/CTO, even on down into the techs, at any of these top N sites
in their categories, did *not* know about tor / vpn / proxy (or have a staffer
they knew to go ask about what's up with the IP's), after decades of these
tools existance and relavance as a class to netsec, even if only in a "Oh

them incompetant and fire them.

Yes, the gist of what I meant was, they don't trust hearing it from
users, and they don't trust hearing it from the likes of Tor Project,
to them they're both biased and outside. But if they hear it from some
lateral in another company, or from certain other circles, they're more
likely to listen and implement.
That's backwards, you're not going to onboard users when shtf unless
you've already done the work to allow them in general population

To the extent that any leaking, sunshine, analysis, media

Though this ventures into mechanics of politics, I think it's
deeply relavent to some of the many reasons anonymous
overlay networks and crypto exist (not limited to Tor), why
people contribute to them, why they need to succeed.

As a general note for authors of things that speak and listen 'socks'...
Some credit would be due for using socks4a instead of socks4.
However both socks4 and socks4a are long deprecated and should
not be implemented. Please write all new projects first in socks5.
Then add code for socks4a if absolutely necessary for legacy support.
Socks5 adds somewhat better DNS / semantics, UDP transport
and IPv6 transport. The latter two, especially IPv6, being mandatory
features for the user of today's internet.
Tor client can listen and speak socks5.
Tor exits cannot speak socks5. For that you either need to
- tunnel the application (socks5) through tor. ie: proxychains
- patch signaling into tor so that some type of client
service request mode causes the exit in use to speak
socks5 on behalf of circuit requestor.
Socat socks5 is partial implement, work with dest-unreach
people to make it fuller semantic like their socks4a implement.

Further complicated by Tor being shown to be not exactly strong
against GPA's, certain other classes of attack, financing, etc.
So the whole thing perhaps backfired over a few months to where
people now feel they can't post freely to peers and/or just don't
care to post anymore.
At least that's one theory I've heard to explain the quiet.
Feel free to suggest or show others.
Don't get me wrong, tor and the project are really awesome
in particular areas and totally worth following [1], just that some
talk I've seen seems feeling the blanket pass to all areas has come
and gone. Is that true and good or bad? I don't know. You'd
probably have to look at the history of opensource projects,
reasonably in the public interest, to determine that. And then
talk about it to see further.

daily via crontab.

Not really. After all, they can't seed their archives

is in mailman with the option turned on by default

them unless the admin explicitly turned it off for

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question regarding Bittorrent [was: regarding relay 
No it doesn't. Last I checked, Vuze leaked all sorts of
junk around the configured proxy. From phoning home
on startup, to whatever else I forgot. When you set a
socks5 proxy in a client, it should send *ALL* traffic through
the proxy, including UDP / IPv6 and everything else, and not fall
back to clearnet for anything ever. It doesn't meet that safe spec.
Since you're currently testing clients (which is very cool and should
be published somewhere), try opening a ticket with vuze and
others on that once you have the proof in packet dumps.
That may be usable but it's certainly not safe.
Then you have more testing to do with tcpdump / wireshark whatever.
This may be true, but if any metadata leaks around socks5,
including DHT, song lookups, covers, advertising, etc... that's bad.
Leaks of any kind that do not have an explicit documented config
option to permit such leaks... are bad.
Yes, DHT, PEX, and tracker should all have separate options.
Because how it works is you're scraping them for client ip's to
connect to, since they are usually udp protocols (except http), and
tor doesn't do udp via socks5, then no ip's and no connecting out
for torrent data for you.
Then there's the issue with ports you're still listening on, etc.
Regardless, if someone configures a global socks5, clients should
honor that. Let them choose more options if they want other
subparts to "work".
Tor doesn't accept inbound connections via exits.
If user's client is listening to clearnet or doing whatsmyip / phonehome
IP discovery on itself, and embedding that in outgoing metadata or
packet addressing, that's a problem too.
You can test and publish a report on it all :)
People can also use onioncat and share completely internal to tor
or use i2p, no exit to clearnet is ever needed eith either of those setups.
Or send it all over some vpn somewhere.

Dmitry Bogatov was arrested on the 6th of April: he became part of the
big penal case initiated by Russia’s Investigation Committee on
"incitations to mass riots" during the protest action that took place on
the 2nd of April in Moscow. According to the Investigation Committee,
Bogatov was publishing messages on the forum sysadmin.ru, inciting to
violent actions, for example, "he" was suggesting to bring to the Red
Square "bottles, fabric, gasoline, turpentine, foam plastic". According
to the Investigation, the experts had analyzed the text of these
messages and proved a "linguistic and psychological characteristics of
incitations to terrorism". However, Dmitry claims that he has nothing to
do with posting the incendiary messages.
Dmitry Bogatov, 25 years old, teaches maths in MFUA (Moscow Finance and
Law University) was a free and open source software activist
Dmitry was administrating a Tor exit node
from his house. In fact, the author of "incendiary messages" (called
"Airat Bashirov") was using Tor, and, by lack of chance, he used the ip
adress of Dmitry's exit node.
Dmitry's lawyer, Alexei Teptsov, presented videos from surveillance
cameras, that proved that, during the moments when the "incendiary
messages" were posted, Dmitry was away from his computer. He was coming
back from a fitness center with his wife, Tatiana, a genetician, and
then went to a supermarket, where cameras were also working. Moreover,
"Airat Bashirov", the author of the provocative messages, continues to
post on sysadmin.ru, while Dmitry is under arrest. The last post was
seen on the forum on April 11.
Dmitry will stay in pre-trial detention center until June 8 at least.
Now the Investigation is examining all his seized devices.

That's an excuse... then their value proposition and even payment
acceptance and spreading models, to from and among users,
weren't high enough, or frictionless / accessible / compatible
enough for certain users, and they deserve to fail.
Now among those that do have some value for which some
extra payments would help sustain them...
Believe it or not, there are many web services out there that do not
require DNA samples or other IRL real name/ID bs to hold an account,
and when you call / email and ask them nicely if they will accept
cash / money order / *coin denoted with and to your account for
whatever bump in service level that gives you, they refuse such
good tender... foot meets bullet.
This also applies to many of the services that will adblock warn / ban you,
when removing adverts from your account is one of the express benefits
they offer to paid accounts... "pay us and we remove the ads" they taunt
on every page. Well, let us pay you then, take our money, bitches.
So that's two simple things they're not doing that they could...
1) Anon prepay for monthly services (prepay also implies behaviour)
2) Anon deposits for behaviour for free services (the Tor / IP blockers
and SMS/phone harvesters among them)
Corps already accept money, so overhead is baloney,
do not try to make it a counter argument, otherwise we'll
trump it and also pay for the two minutes of part time high
school kid's daily routine needed to process ours.
Nor is compliance, as anon already permitted above.
(BTW, some big compliance service like banks, already
established accounts via various secure means, even
offline / 2FA, so to their credit for those that do that,
they let you login from the entire IPv4 / IPv6 address

That's fine, if implemented well, because the 'one free' is the
same as 'account creation', everyone gets a chance, then
there's other metrics applied after you're in to continually
evaluate further addition / subtraction of oppression.
In this example, 1 free search across all exit nodes, then captcha'ing all
subsequent searches... well that would be 1000 searches total, and no more,
ever. And that 1000 somehow a giant crush upon googles infrastructions? No.
Yes, you can't do 1 free as the *only* defense layer.
If google continally checked the session as first above, combined
with an initial captcha, then this isn't really a problem. Of couse
only one method would be insufficient. So it doesn't work that way.
But as implemented...
How about when google throws captcha, you solve
it, and accept their cookie... you're now human.
Now get a new ip, or wait some time, or search for random
stuff / strings at human speed... all with the same cookies,
and they throw captcha again or worse, flat deny all further search
to your existing cookies.
"Our systems have detected unusual traffic from your computer network."
Ok, sure maybe you loaded your cookies into your bot.
But I doubt your bot looks very humanlike.
And you're probably not going to cost effectively pay some
third world army of humans to keep solving hourly captchas
and reloading the cookies into your bot.
I'd question google on the captcha issue, at least the sensitivity.
Among other issues.
Tor / Anon is a genuine impact to that and their PhD's?
If so, a google presentation and fora on that would
be quite interesting to see and discuss.
Perhaps if they put 1/1000th of what they put into
developing their html email, emojis, fonts, default top
post, whacked interface and threading, oh and say
SMS and datamining their users...
there would be no issues for people here to bring up.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor blacklists [was: WebIron] 
Expanding some aspects touched on in the WebIron thread...
Publishing, operating, advertising and promoting these sorts of
data lists with explicit documentation on how to block tor is
tactically counterproductive to at least one side of the very
circumvention tech tor claims to be about... in particular if such
online tools are highly accurate... for example, the ability to merely
read the frontpage / content of many services becomes "Access Denied" [1].
Tor [Project Inc] engages in publishing these for a number of
[un]spoken reasons. It's trying to curry favor in courts, legislation,
news media, corporations, donors and other venues as a nice player...
for survival of Tor both as "Inc" the corporate tool producer, and
the tool as a tech itself (think Napster, BT/uT situation here).
To demo promote best practice accuracy and distinction between exit
and non-exit to third party blocklists. And to permit services to
grant special favor to users of shared IP's (noting the internet
has thousands more NAT/VPN/Proxy that can reach similar users per IP
magnitude and are no less problematic or important or favored).
Spammers and criminals don't go out of their way to generate and
distribute non-intrinsic data and docs on how to kill themselves.
So SpamBL's, HackBL's, BotBL's, etc all emerged as third party
productions, with various degrees of quality, personality, fees,
and adoption and impact therein.
Tor's consensus is intrinsic, and it has various data subprojects
created and tuned by, and for benefit of, its tor-client users,
relay operators, devs, and research. However tor's explicit provision
of its own BL tools is not intrinsic or needed by those groups.
In their operational lifetime such BL's do aid and feed into
restriction of circumvention tech. And long term such provided lists
may be moot since playing nice and data is not what is actually at
stake with tor, or with any other generally anonymous encrypted
overlay and guerilla networks. What's at stake is anonymity,
privacy, crypto, freedom, and a host of other related issues.
How and when you get there is up to you.
There is no real point being made here. Other than highlighting a
variety of aspects people should think about when this topic comes up.
Note also that...
a) Tor tries to protect its bridges instead of listing them all too.
b) One proxy vpn project injects the likes of the Alexa Top Lists at
 random into its node lists making it politically harder to block by
 dumb consensus scrapers, and of course harder to connect at first).
c) Some tor relay operators do deploy the following specifically
 to add in some anti-blocking diversity for tor exits...
 - Local NAT
 - OutboundBindAddress
 - Forwarding exit over VPN's
[1] Though it is not known any research on the subject, compare
also some results of such tools, regardless of who produces them...

@_subject: [tor-talk] [tor-relays] Connectivity issues; disabling my relay 
At first all I read in your graph was the latency drop.
But yes now I see the underlying loss shift from green to
a darker base. It can be crap hardware / connection or
bandwidth overload. In those cases you can open a ticket
with whatever data you can find and see what comes back.
If you hit gold, ask them for a job if you want one :)
Latency drops are usually cutting legacy routers and
needless layers out of the path, or more direct physical
routes. Fewer hops are also sometimes seen with mpls or
enabled by longer range optics layers in place of routers.
If there are any "stupid" adversaries left, they might show
up as increase in latency / loss / hop count, rarely a
decrease, unless their TTL editing is broken.
It's also will never be seen as a bad move to shut down
a relay if adversary action is suspected until explained
otherwise. Reasonable caution and consideration and
input sought, whether public or private, is a good thing
in this game.
Roger points out some good papers, and has listed others
previously that you can look for in the archives.
I often submit [reasonably or not] that, and as suggested in at least
one of those papers...
1) if an adversary can inject / mod undetectables into, or
otherwise unrevertably data tag, your encrypted datastream,
you need to rethink that stream.
2) you can defeat network traffic analysis / timing / correlation by GPA's,
including active fill / loss and modulation attacks upon the wire itself,
by establishing fulltime dynamic fill traffic in place of otherwise
voids in user
demand load, and by enforcing strict expected and negotiated channel
parameters with peers upon penalty of rejection, and by reclocking traffic
that you pass. (This is meant p2p parameters, not a solution to rogue
nodes otherwise privy to or generating underlying encryption layers over
user cleartext content.)
I think the research and development fields on this topic regarding
application to potential [overlay] networks (not just necessarily tor)
are still very much wide open for those who would like to take them up :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Finally a Cloudflare captchas workaround thanks to 
The longest onion collision (match) I've seen actively deployed is a 10 char
prefix. That leaves headroom of about 2^29 on average, ie: at least a billion
times more work to actually generate a full collision, which isn't going
to happen, certainly not against whatever boring shit people are using
centralized onion services for... it'd be easier to find and own the service.
Finding even a simple numeric counter match to a randomly chosen 2^80
bitstring using 10k nodes @ 10GHz would take 192 years on average.
Being tired at the moment to say these numbers correct,
practically speaking, cloudflare's excuse seems a bit invalid.
Be careful that the theory of some tomorrows distant,
doesn't hold you back from building today's needed
(and importantly, modularly updateable, systems) today.
Don't guess / depend on what a corp will do for you, it probably won't.

@_subject: [tor-talk] EOTK Video #3 - Deploying Onions At Scale with EOTK 
A better description for this is 'proxying' for wikipedia via onion frontends.
Some years ago a number of us were actually 'mirroring' and importing
wikipedia's dumps into read-only onionland instances of mediawiki.
Most seem to have passed perhaps due to dataset growth, lack of
endangered status, moving on, etc.
Clearnet services establishing their own onion / i2p / cjdns / whatever,
is an interesting idea that's becoming more popular since the 2010's.
However there is bandwidth impact to the network compared
to the usual 'client -> exit -> service' 3-node 1-circuit exit case.
- Hosting the onion on your service interfaces costs double+
to the network over the standard exit case.
- Should never run an onion just to route that back out over
exits... that costs triple+ over the standard exit case.
If the services are also running their tor daemons as non-exit
relays with bandwidth provided back at around 3:1 of what they
handle from tor, that seems more balanced.
Adjustment is to be made of course for the preferred single-onion
services method which has recently become prominent.

There are many other similar non normals, that is a good thing.
There is no fooling people who have been around the block more than
once. Tor Project Inc has plainly demonstrated itself as fully corporatized.
And it has substantial monetary and other strategic resources that would
make other projects in the space cry. (Or as the case may be, reject various
elements of the Tor Project Inc as a model they would care to follow after).
Depends on their priorities and policies. Given tor has few dependencies
above and below it, I'd think most would accept a bump to the latest version..
Now who generates the bump as in (1) above is different story.
Yes those having other priorities tend to have beefs with Debian.
Just because freezer can doesn't mean should freeze beef forever.
"OpenSSL" is security-sensitive software with ...
"kernel" is ...
"*" is ...
Linux distro model has imparted a brokenverse upon itself and its users.
Do not feel bad or that you have to solve it for them, unless that
should be your life's next happy project.
Why more crit rsn?, it's always been a useful tool.
OnionCat is an example of a tool that is very useful and
is absolutely going prop224 critical real soon now.
In fact, both tools are critical for case of helping mass adoption
and applications. However one of them is about to be hard killed
off with no thought or effort to refresh or replace its functionality.
A corporate manager might put some of the team from the
now mostly finished torsocks refresh, as part onto a new onioncat
team. Some of them having recently thought about Socks5,
OS interfaces, and network bits other than TCP. Granted problem
requires mostly thinkers around onions, or big protocol update.
As always, faced with problem of raising and allocation of volunteer
resources across shared responsibility space. No answer there
other than bring them all together for a powwow [1] on the subject.
[1] But if there's big interim demand to have something to
point your users to as supported all else be damned...
compile statically for in /.../ for your platforms and
distribute and document that. That's what corporate $payware
software houses / sellers often do. Some even ship their own OS
environment if the user's is too much to deal with.

Maybe they, or even we, are few who can do that philosophy freely.
There is but good and no fault there.
Well this isn't really a forum for mass users, if Tor Corp wanted a mass
forum, which is interesting possibility, it would create a "forum" for them.
"Forums" suck balls for technical reasons, but it could be a win.
I welcome these users, all users, to any overlay system,
for whatever their use case.
Well sure there are orders of magnitude involved, but one should
not mistake certain structures and operative methods.
Right. Except you know I see development diversity value in the
same for other anon overlay systems, be they extant or upcoming.
ie: tor is rather done model these days, and not end all be all.
I guess that was the bit about distributing static binaries of Tor.
If I recall, tor used to make rpms for some OS or another,
but then reached effective partnership and/or was satisfied with
current versions and discontinued the tor rpms. This was
maybe two years ago.
Tor could probably pay a $10-25k stipend to provide statics
for all OS if it wanted to.
Tor is definitely web viewing centric at its roots. Yet does not
web viewing make mass protocol share. Now who will pick up
other (or the full) proto set?
tortel () { socat -d -d -,ignoreeof
socks4a:127.0.0.1:${1%%:*}:${1 ; }
Still hoping socks5 gets fully implemented in socat rsn ...
Didn't look, some are probably still previous generation.
It sortof was/is included as 'torify'. But then you'd have to consider
shipping OnionCat, Stem, etc as well.
AF_ONION would be amazing. As would AF_*.
All being a few delicious kernel modules away...
Prop224 is necessary, or at least prudent, killing off users
of tools without providing even non-ideal hackish interim
replacements is not.

Some dreprobs in the onions have been doing this for years with OnionCat.
Or with plain onions if they use unidirectional channels, or before ocat.
People have posted tests/reports/performance to the list now and then
over the years. Text, audio, video has long been possible subject only
to the weather of your [engineered|random] circuit and the bitrate
+1 to everyone playing with these things.
Absolutely. Same for whatever functions other overlay networks are
good at too. Yet at least with tor, how will that happen when it is
restricted to strictly TCP and onion addressing? Is this all the world
is made of? And just how limiting is that to development of varying
apps, particularly P2P and the stacks required for it?
Even if we had AF_*, we could hardly call it a solution for it will
take many years for the appplications and their protocols to
be patched and enhanced to use it.
In some areas we are, or are regressing (ie: prop224 onioncat / onionvpn).
Then it seems Tor / overlays will have to build in support for easy.
And app makers will have to give up their centralized services
$IPO dreams for the greater good and new dreams of true p2p.
Not as if they could not have a donate button or other model therein.
And lots more leaders will need to dive into the onion (and *overlay)
space to promote the meatspace and develop the underlying tools as
a whole. Beyond just setting up and announcing another Elgg.onion,
or another new redundant *coin.
Governments will have to relax and let progress beyond the
old legacies.
And let us not forget that the "Internet" was an uneasy
mystery for most users in the 1990's, but by a decade later
they largely taught themselves the necessary details.
If you build it they will come.

Remember, tor's onion services were an early yet subsequent happenstance
that piggybacked on tor's already developed primary clearnet access case,
architecture and deployment. We all recognize the need for two things
1) clearnet access strategies, perhaps as largely represented by tor today
2) private / hidden / p2p services ecosystems
Under that realization, and developing / choosing best to suit needs,
it really doesn't matter if one application (tor) does them both or not.
So the use of 'future' or 'downfall' is not really a fairly applicable or
expectable terminology there. Forking / pathfinding of ideas / code
for best fitment is not shameful, it's necessary.
For all we know I2P or some other overlay will rise to serve (2).
Perhaps IETF will RFC for all physical links and chips being
point-to-point encrypted per link with full time background fill traffic.
Perhaps... lots of things to come we cannot predict yet.

Replacement would require knowledge interest support and participation
in individually owned and p2p connected guerrilla networking by the masses.
So shall we physically say till then (excepting local community versions
of that) we attempt to use internet overlays instead, of which CJDNS,
I2P etc may be an example.
Then we think of not replacing the internet but replicating it.
There is codewise replication, ie: dotted quad / IP, C / Java, ...
And functional replication, ie: categories of uses / cases
and analogs... messaging, storage, publication, etc.
Yes codewise is not required. Yet to achieve this, functional may
likely be required. Then what do your code choices limit there?
What is one person's value, interest, diverse, fun? Same as another's?
And how do you scale it when even one fun app becomes a hit.
Tor probably can't support a Candy Crush worth of users.
So do you purposefully limit it, nullifying the "_everybody_" goal?
The augmentation and v.i.d.f. are surely beginning to be present.
And will continue to happen as overlay networks progress :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Exits: In Crossfire on the Front Lines 
Russian Crossfire on the Tor Project
Welcome to the first quarter of 2017. The Ruskies have successfully
completed a major full-scope information operation aimed at installing
the next leader of the free world. And it’s no secret; numerous top
cyber-security firms have placed direct attribution of the attack on
the combined Russian Intelligence Services using the Tor network to
mask their point of origin.
As a shocked and dazed United States regains its consciousness we can
expect to see direct measures to mitigate this breed of cyberattacks
in the near future. This response will lead to increased
surveillance/compromise of Tor network infrastructure and leaves
common Tor users caught in the midst of cyberwarfare.
In today’s cyberwar, Tor exit nodes represent the front line of
battle. At this location it is possible to directly observe attacks,
to launch attacks, and to even gather intelligence. An alarming figure
disclosed by The Intercept’s Micah Lee attributed 40% of the network
addresses used in the Grizzly Steppe campaign are Tor exit nodes. And
this is not a good thing.
The concept of collateral damage does not escape the reality of cyber
warfare. We can expect Tor users to be impacted tremendously as cyber
frontlines are militarized. Those users seeking refuge within the Tor
network can expect to be caught in the crossfire with no end in sight.
The funding and resources that will be used to increase capabilities
with regard to Tor networking will be tremendous.
We can expect massive IDS arrays to capture traffic on the wire or
even as native exit nodes. Additionally we can expect nation-states to
operate a larger proportion of exit nodes as they allow for
significantly enhanced information operation capabilities versus line
We can also expect to see additional research on executing de-cloaking
attacks against both hidden services and end-users. Some of this
research may be done openly and in public but for sure not all of it
will be.
Ultimately the weaponization and militarization of the Tor network by
Russian cyber aggressors will leave a large pool of human refugees
with no home.
It’s 2017. Welcome to the frontlines comrade.

Tor et al are now publicly recognized tools for all manner of
activities spanning a range of legitimacies as interpreted by
whichever users activists and analysts. They're going to have more
serious adversarial threats deployed against them, and more games
played with them. Tor, crypto, users etc... they're all in the [geo]political,

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is tor network 100 percent anonymous ? 
It's statistical. There are no available trust metrics, or even afaik any
studies of the network metas to discover any potential for trust metrics.
Consensus weighting could be seen as a kind of analog for trust,
but its one based on only a few potential parameters that might
make up a full list of trust parameters one could assign various
importance to. Others have proposed additional parameters
that could make up such a list that users might choose to use.
MyFamily is tricky to understand.
It removes use of a quantity relays that you might otherwise normally
consider and use as 'good' relays, thus raising statistical risk of pathing
through 'bad' relays that are of course purposefully not familied together.
Adversary who compromises a family, particularly in a manner that
chills speech of operator (law) or mirages their vision (rootkit), will perhaps
deconfigure the family association in order to increase their
statistical numbers.
And afaik no one is watching for orphans moving out of family statements.
Though some people watch for nodes to aggregate into family.
And family is encouraged for and used by operators since it does
cover a lot of attack surface.
Be aware of your general use of unencrypted data and context over clearnet.
And extremely aware of any authentication info or sensitive datas
Depends on capabilities of adversary, and any level of interest
they might have in your activities.
For the typical innocent home user, and with proper usage, tor provides
a very high level of location anonymity, and content protection within the
tor network, up against say, your local ISP, or the website you're visiting.
That's what tor was designed for, and why lots of people use it.
Tor is not "100% anonymous".
You must study your usage and use case up against your threat
model in order to determine suitability of any given tool.
These analyses and risks and benefits apply to other networks
as well, not just tor.
Yes. Though at the point of owning the full path, they'll probably
go for the full decrypt as well.

Rather than disclose the source code that the FBI used to target a
child porn suspect, federal prosecutors in Tacoma, Washington recently
dropped their appeal in United States v. Michaud.
The case is just one of 135 federal prosecutions nationwide involving
the Tor-hidden child porn website Playpen. The vast effort to bust
Playpen has raised significant questions about the ethics, oversight,
capabilities, and limitations of the government’s ability to hack
criminal suspects.
Last year, a federal judge in a related case prosecuted out of
Oklahoma, United States v. Arterbury, also ruled against the
prosecution. The government eventually dropped the appeal and then
dismissed the indictment at the district court in October 2016. Yet
another Playpen case, United States v. Levin, where the defense
prevailed initially, is currently on appeal at the 1st US Circuit
Court of Appeals. Beau Croghan, a man in Iowa, was another alleged
user hit by this NIT—his case was just one of three in which a judge
ruled to suppress the evidence due to a defective warrant. Croghan's
case is now pending before the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals.
Beyond Michaud, Fieman is representing another Playpen defendant in
the same judicial district (the Western District of Washington) before
the very same judge. In the second case, the evidence and legal
questions are nearly identical. That case, United States v. Tippens,
is set to go to trial on February 27, 2017 in Tacoma.

You can connect just about anything TCP to Tor or I2P, or even Phantom
and a couple other overlay networks.
But for Tor, if it's not TCP, you're screwed... because Tor seems to have
zero interest in providing a native means to transport other protocols
such as UDP *between onions*, or in developing or supporting the
plugins or other layers needed to do so.
Voice / Video / VOIP / chat apps often use UDP.
So do some DHTs that help make P2P apps like BT work.
Here's a very cool tool that uses UDP, designed in part for some
of the network anomalies common to overlay networks...
And many application protocols are incompatible with onion addressing.
So you'll need OnionCat to do those and other cool things... :)
And you'll need to find some users and developers interested
in continuing / new development of such enabling tools / layers.
Because OnionCat is both unmaintained, and Tor is killing
it off with prop224 in a few years.

Tor's operators can provide this in three ways...
1) Operators setting different OutboundBindAddress.
2) Operators tunneling out via some VPN, NAT, etc.
3) Operators providing full OpenVPN termination / binding services
for users, as I've described previously.
However, since Tor Project Inc insists on developing, operating, and
providing tools to the world that make labeling and blocking tor
users easy, such as TorDNSEL service, there are some odds there.
TPI says the tools help provide positive options to include tor users,
but fails to provide links on that service page to research or case
studies that back that up (regardless if TPI or third party BL service)
in any appreciable ratio or notable cases against the continual reports
that blocking seems to be the prevailing situation.
That research is an available project if someone wants to study it.

An 'exit bridge' in this sense could just be requesting
'getexitbridges' to send you connection details to
such an OpenVPN termination point.
Operators and others could run this without TPI
involvement and perhaps resist what accurates TorDNSEL.
Or simply run a parallel network with other exit IP until such

Government fiat banks and friends will always threat pressure down
through the centralized corp exchanges, thus shutting off unverified
purchasers of even small goods via etailers (or whatever else bitpay
types are processing, like donations to registered public charities).
They claim all sorts of reasons, but it's really about them losing
power to better models that don't include them.
Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Zcash Zclassic and so on, among others...
some are designed to be usable anon mode so you can
freely engage in free local and global p2p economies as desired.
A "replacement" is a fully distributed p2p app version of the
centralized 'localbitcoins' 'in person exchange' mode.
And of course accepting payment for your goods and services in
crypto, procuring the same with crypto, and helping others do theirs.
If you think using 10k tor nodes to 1M+ users is sufficiently safe
from cost / etc of standing up any real percent of sybils, you'll feel
warm fuzzy using the 1M traders to 1M users such an app is likely
to present, complete with whatever rates, ratings, locations, amounts,
PKI WoT etc each user will optionally present.
These trading apps may even use some of the same transports
the wallets do, or be integrated within wallets.
The regulated bitpay's of the world have their place in the
ecosystem and help push the envelope.
If you yourself (users) don't feel the need to be regulated over,
develop and push an alternative that doesn't.
Sure, reach out...
To whoever exchanger is blocking you, they make money off you.
And to whoever merchant, you have money, tell them you want to
give it to them.

Run by relay operators was the general idea, a bit more spine,
and more flexible setup. But certainly not restricted to that.
Some streams last more than a day, some apps are resumable,
but breaking the tuple and forcing a reneg or getexitbridges
more than once a day will seriously piss users off.
Millions of circuits worth of v6 a day also happen.
But yes you could get and SWIP a v6 /whatever worth
and throw them once a week or whatever your get and use
model for users rationally permits. Once a week is 52.
One per requestor, spread across all exits, probably possible.
v6 are unlimited but hosters probably still charge like gold for them.

Pinning exit only helps if the exit is the effective IP connecting
to whatever clearnet service / peer user is using.
If talking about using VPN, NAT, or whatever thing after the exit, then the
output side of that thing is what is doing the TCP/UDP to the service.
And pinning exit helps stability to input side of that thing as well.
Whatever your effective IP is, if it's flapping around out from under
your app, your app breaks, at least momentarily till it's noticed.
Trying to extend some new tor level circuit api out to a new control
interface on OpenVPN / NAT seems much work, and unrelated
to dodging censorship... circuits only serve anonymizing / protective
purpose internal to tor involving choosing its path and exits.
OpenVPN itself, or kernel nat filter rules, could be extended
to shove / switch matching traffic (like hashes of destination address
prefixes or flow tuples) over some IPv6 rotation machine schedule.
There may already be some kernel kit for the matching part.
IPv4 blocks cost money to play with and deploy so that's
moot as far as rotation goes. But an extra ipv4 address is
still valid for an exit or openvpn operator to park an
openvpn node on for getexitbridges.
I posted some long thing somewhere once about various
ways operators could bind openvpn to tor exits for use by users.
SSH or some other v6 proxy, authenticated or not, could also work.
Operators could also raise funds by running these things.
If you're providing some passive nat rotation scheme...
1) As before, someone should research the net result of providing DNSEL's.
Not just to legal strategic friendly of TPI / tor, but to speech / reading.
2) No, the stable flag is probably of more interest.

@_subject: [tor-talk] German BND 2010: Tor Unsuitable 
A global passive adversary
Like all low-latency anonymity systems used in practice, Tor cannot
protect against „a global passive adversary“. This is defined in the
design document. The software documentation warns: „If your attacker
can watch the traffic coming out of your computer, and also the
traffic arriving at your chosen destination, he can use statistical
analysis to discover that they are part of the same circuit.“ The goal
of NSA’s and GCHQ’s internet surveillance is to achieve exactly that.
A number of researchers have demonstrated this attack in practice,
either by simply counting transmitted packets, by analyzing time
windows, or correlation attacks with only a fraction of traffic. All
this research is public. The spy agencies followed this research, used
it for their own purpose and turned theoretical vulnerabilities into
real-world surveillance systems.
Very high level of surveillance
One and a half years later, the BND warned German federal agencies not
to use Tor. The hacker unit „IT operations“ entitled its report: „The
anonymity service Tor does not guarantee anonymity on the internet“.
The six-page paper was sent to the chancellery, ministries, secret
services, the military and police agencies on 2 September 2010.
According to the executive summary, Tor is „unsuitable“ for three
scenarios: „obfuscating activities on the internet“, „circumventing
censorship measures“ and „computer network operations for intelligence
services“ – spy agency hacking. The BND assumes „a very high level of
surveillance within the network“

Well it is perhaps possible to avoid that to you, by this user
completely sequestering the node from you operator access,
other than to allow you operator payment to hosting account.
User must still then investigate the HW and SW, which can
assure only themselfs, not similarly trustfully out to the rest
of the users, since as such this user is then effectively operator.
So it is back to, for any explicit trust upon a node, all three
must be continually investigated... operator, HW, SW.
Else you rely on theories of goodwill and random chance.
Unfortunately or not, that appears to be viewed as sufficient,
as even modest proposals of establishing optional Web of Trust
among operators, and community analysis of meta parameters
of nodes into optionally subscribable lists of nodes to use...
have not been taken up and tried as projects yet.

each method of constraining application traffic to tor
works before choosing one, then set it up and test
extensively before use. And deploying an out of band
managed catchall packet filter is essential to helping
prevent eventual IP leaks.
Four common methods for ssh are...
kernel agnostic - the above global packet filters
kernel scoped to userland - aorta on linux, or roll your own on bsd
library mangling - torsocks, not for static compiled apps
application rtfm [1] - ssh_config Host and ProxyCommand
They all should be capable of capturing whatever ssh emits,
however each box, config, usage and user is different.
Last... SSH often involves a live bidirectional terminal
and X connection to a potentially adversarial remote machine...

They're pretty friendly and open to trying things.

relavant lists for comment, and open a ticket
to further the process into some work.

Yes, BSD makes a fine OS whether from server

beyond, or wishes to grow beyond, just one OS,
should pick it up and give it a go. And in a land
of Windows and Linux by default, BSD is fun in
part because how well it competes on similar level
while being lesser known and growing quickly. So of
course people are going to advocate for, develop,
and use that.
If new users haven't identified something specific they
need from the former list of actively maintained BSD

FreeBSD still maintains its first original and "official" means of
"support" on mailing lists, which are not known to filter tor sources.
There's also the handbook, manpages, internet search, etc.
So if you are a BSD user who needs help with BSD, same
as before... do some or all of the following...
- Search the net
- Participate in or ask help questions in any unblocked appropriate
channel, such as perhaps, if FreeBSD, freebsd-questions at freebsd.org
- Use tor's exit selection features to try to bypass any blocking
- File an OS ticket to alleviate and design out any blocking issues,
send it and any forum thread here for weigh in from more tor users.
lists @ tpo is not the place to lodge OS "feedback",

While https adoption is related to impact, hsts isn't since it only applies

No. Because when LE gets compromised, then you have
a million tbb's blindly trusting rogue / stolen certs, mitm, etc,
and tbb won't ship and users won't update until after the
exploits are wild. At least as it is now they get warned every time.
This is a server admin issue plain and simple.
And perhaps also a CA's vs cert stores issue.
If the admin won't fix it, then the user can add it manually.
If the user isn't keeping state, or carrying cert on usb, that's
their choice and problem. They can just as easily search the
fingerprint, or memorize / create the cert's location, before
hitting accept.
If tbb users really crying over this, tpo, or anyone, could publish
a cert file full of intermediate certs onsite, but probably won't because
it puts them on the hook exploit timewise. So OS, browsers and other
tools only ship / reference the primary cert stores.

Though a bit moot unless recompilation is needed to add.
They're signed by others and not typically self signed and they're not "root"
CA's under typical cert hierarchy checks against the handful of default cert
store repositories out there. Nor do I or the code treat int's as roots,
and the subject thread clearly is on int's.
A shipped cert is a shipped cert.
And which certs get added, from which interim spaces China's / RU / US / IN,
only internet activist orgs / big corps / edu's, who defines them,
checks the certs,
decides, what stops the slope.
Up to the importer / truster, no different than with PGP, overlay bootstraps,
govt id's, etc. That's one interim fix. Whether they're dumb or smart about
it, or do it at all, is up to them.
I don't want int's that don't meet cert store policies coded in my tools,
just the same as I don't want any root stores shipped in my tools.
Look at all those twistable / govt / third party entities in those stores.
No thanks. Not when building from zero, transparency, oob verification,
tofu, fingerprinting / pinning, dns, etc are available, including using default
cert stores, at least through library calls to outside the app.

Those three are overlapping yet separable depending

There may in fact be enough research to inhibit strict GPAs.
GAAs may be a bit harder depending on range of actions,

Tor can't change design to fight such GPA due to inertia,

political which can be thought up, investigated, discussed, etc.
And if the same community / corporation "Tor" tried to, many
would reasonably question the homing of that endeavour.

The relay won't [likely] be badexited because neither it nor its upstream is
shown to be doing anything malicious. Simple censorship isn't enough.
And except for such limited censorship, the nodes are otherwise fully
useful, and provide a valuable presence inside such regions / networks.
Users, in such censoring regimes, that have sucessfully connected
to tor, already have free choice of whatever exits they wish, therefore
such censorship is moot for them.
For everyone else, and them, workarounds exist such as,,,
search engines, sigs, vpns, mirrors, etc
Further, whatever gets added to static exitpolicy's might move out
from underneath them or the censor, the censor may quit, or the exit
may fail to maintain the exitpolicy's. None of which are true representation
of the net, and are effectively censorship as result of operator action
even though unintentional / delayed.
Currently many regimes do limited censorship like this,
so you'd lose all those exits too for no good reason, see...
And arbitrarily hamper spirits, tactics, and success of volunteer
resistance communities and operators in, and fighting, such regimes
around the world.
And if the net goes chaotic, majority of exits will have limited visibility,
for which exitpolicy / badexit are hardly manageable solutions either,
and would end up footshooting out many partly useful yet needed
exits as well.
If this situation bothers users, they can use... SIGNAL NEWNYM,
New Identity, or ExcludeExitNodes.
They can also create, maintain and publish lists of whatever such
classes of nodes they wish to determine, including various levels
of trust, contactability, verification, ouija, etc... such that others
can subscribe to them and Exclude at will.
They can further publish patches to make tor automatically
read such lists, including some modes that might narrowly exclude
and route stream requests around just those lists of censored
destination:exit pairings.
Ref also...
In the subect situations, you'd want to show that it is in fact
the exit itself, not its upstream, that is doing the censorship.
Or that if fault can't be determined to the upstream or exit, what
would be the plausible malicious benefit for an exit / upstream
to block a given destination such that a badexit is warranted...
a) Frustrate and divert off 0.001% of Turk users smart enough to
use tor, chancing through tor client random exit selection of your
blocking exit, off to one of the workarounds that you're equally
unlikely to control and have ranked, through your exit vs one
of the others tor has open?
b) Prop up weird or otherwise secretly bad nodes on the net,
like the hundreds of other ones out there, for which no badexit
or diverse subscription services yet exist to qualify them?
c) ???
Or that some large number of topsites were censored via
singular or small numbers of exits / upstreams so as to be
exceedingly annoying to the network users as a whole, where
no other environment of such / chaotic widespread annoyance

In a thread...
(noting that all onions can be physically located by determined
adversaries, thus failing another commonly sold security assertion)
That assertion is irrelevant in the security context
of the thread so far, and it's dangerous advice.
As with protonmail and all the other fakeass encrypted email
websites... the JS code is loaded by the browser from the web
service itself, there is currently NO trusted way for the user to
independantly audit that the code they end up executing in
real time *from* the service matches the code *in* any repo,
or for the user to choose to ignore the service code and load
and execute any repo code of their choosing instead.
The current code load model is a nasty exploit waiting to happen,
does happen (Hushmail, NIT's, etc), and simply should not be trusted,
no more than GOOG and FB the dicks, themselves, indeed.
Or Java, ActiveX, Flash, and whatever other "secure" crap some
scam tries to push into your pathetically insecure and
untrusted exec platform.
Sure Invidious Onion is fun, probably has some merits and
use cases, and even simple html could be an exploit, and
users can run it all in a sandbox, etc.
But let's not say there's any trusted link between the running
and repo codes, nor that any sufficient set of people have looked
at, and signed over, most codes, or are even allowed to... [1].
Also, clicking on any video listed on the onion frontpage
index initiates at least three connections straight to google
instead of the proxy onion. That's not clean.
... those and a few others readers can find and post here.
[1] You can't even say those for the release iso's of
OpenBSD, FreeBSD, the Linux's, etc... back
to their claimed source code repos... because
either those repos have no internal cryptographic
roots or hashes to sign over or with in the first place,
or some process in the path from there to the iso's
is not reproducible or cryptographically chained.
Same goes for Apple, Microsoft, Intel, AMD, ARM,
Government, etc...
You're all still woefully fucked therein because you keep

cryptocurrencies explicitly advertised and designed to use
with Tor.
Some are here, some are in sites of other messaging systems...
All overlay networks currently in production are
massively vulnerable to at least two classes of attack
by sufficiently interested and capable adversaries...
1) Sybil
a) This requires people to actually use PKI to make and use
assertions and identities and to punt the results they get from
their deep social anal probing of each other in real life as
operator peers worldwide... into the consensus, DHT, or whatever
mechanism each network uses for node approval and selection.
b) Also requires complete ongoing analysis of all known physical
and logical metadata and behaviour of the nodes themselves.
2) Global Passive Monitoring
The US NSA, Global and Regional Telecom Corporations,
and other Entities Worldwide, acting both separately and
together, have a complete passive and active view of the
internet from at minimum the Global Tier-1 ISP Level,
including significant analysis and recording capabilities
Yet everyone still stupidly fails to execute at least a few of
the seemingly available and reasonable countermeasures...
a) Encrypt Everything.
Automatic, on by default, strong crypto suites, forward
secrecy, tofu, psk, rekeying, whatever works best, etc... both...
1) By and between end to end users, same for server to server...
2) On all physical network links worldwide, every port
automagic and independant... fiber, copper, radio, etc...
embedded in the network hardware itself via RFC, IEEE, etc
b) Deploy fulltime network fill traffic aka chaff, to fill the committed
capacity that each node provisioned itself into the [overlay]
network with, dynamically yielding room for and upon native traffic.
This applies both to, logical nets 2a1, and physical nets 2a2, above.
c) Politics, Anarchism, Cryptocurrency Crowdfunding, and
whatever else works to uproot and route around persistant
known bad actors.
3) Etc
Nobody seems to want to do much on the above, to actually
shape those into effective global project efforts, to deploy any
sufficient mitigation finally therein, therefore the vulnerabilities
shall remain.

Moot when $10k is probably enough to Sybil at least

So if Tor is done, why don't you start writing grants to reseach,
advance, and solve some of the undone, equally applicable,
and necessary problem space of mixnets and other potential
designs, instead of continuing to throw [government] money
at Tor's curve of diminishing returns.
Start advertising, using, analysing other types of networks then.
Why do so many reviews keep implying this copout,
"B network doesn't have X feature therefore B sucks"...
of course networks are different, unique features are
not detractions they're just incomparable items,
go compare and analyse the similar features then.
Both Tor and I2P generally claim their non-exit modes
to be anonymous advanced designs resistant to attack.
Go compare and analyze that. If you don't like the results,
go start new designs.
Reviews can even conform features... users can
actually torrent internally over both, and exit over
both... analyze that.
Many orthagonal features are modular ideas embeddable
in any decent network anyway, so they're not necessarily
unique, only a matter of doing it, if sensible of course.
Yes you can, you just have to find or be an exit outproxy service
and configure it manually.
Government: Initialed the Tor design, put in Decades of $Millions
of controlling interest funding, and programmed Marketing.
Throw those kind of resources at I2P or any other network
and they would be relatively equal contenders too.
Throw Voluntary versions of those kinds of resources
at any network, and it might be a bit more novel and free
to go up against the backer of the "successful" one above.
So stuff I2P inside TBB's work and call it IBB.

These are two separate things not necessarily tied together,
thus split for clarity as above.
The former a) is up to the onion operator based on their needs.
If they have no need for v2, or need v3, they can or should
switch to v3, indeed.
The latter b) is a feature that some users and operators
in and for onionspace explicitly choose and depend on
to support common apps, and thus would definitely not
like to see yanked out from under them.
Better instead to advertise and update the default onion
semantics for [new] users to v3, and continue support
and backport doable features to v2 until time below...
Node operators (tor-relays) would continue offering
v2 HSDir support module until such time as the reasons
for choosing v2 by those above are supported in v3 or vN.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Abuse complaint 418289 
There are some onion services and nodes that directly deliver
outbound via exits to clearnet destinations. They tend to
be unreliable for obvious reasons of today's spam preventions.
Other implementations of Tor mail services rent a frontend
domain and clearnet shell, tunnel the Tor mail to that point
on clearnet via onion or exit, and deliver it on to clearnet
destinations from there. That model does not need 465.
Unfortunately there is some legacy mashup for sending mail,
regarding server and users use of "smtp" 25 and "smtps" 465,
and variously plaintext or tls or starttls on top of those ports.
Fortunately these days 25 and 465 hardly enable or
document for user use anymore.
Same here for 576.
587 is submission protocol, dedicated to authenticated users
sending mail smtp over starttls.
As with fetching pop3s 995 and imaps 993, sending submission 587
is critical for use with users mail clients.
pop3s 995 and imaps 993 are not any nuisance at all.
submission 587 could be spammy but gets account nuked quickly.
ssh 22 is just internet scanning noise with occaisional crack.
You could negotiate away 567 for free.
See about discussing proportion of 22 noise coming from exit
versus clearnet, and the huge legit use it has.
And keep the three mail client ports as equally legit.
You could also analyse all the exits in consensus
to see which ports are at risk of not having enough
exit support and thus might be more needed.
And publish your analysis project results.
Since you operate exits, you might want to join
tor-relays at lists.torproject.org
where all these things and more help are in the archives.
And there are wiki.torproject.org pages to list
results of searches for ISP's.

The underlying tech is kernel facilities and filters like pf / ipfw / nftables.
For Linux see...
One way for non coders to review it is to observe if the rulesets
it creates meets comprehensive expectations and makes sense.
You'd need to read the manpages for the filter in question.
Kernel packet filters have rule over userland software / libraries / users.
If you compile tor or telnet statically, you can't torsocks them,
but you can aorta them.
Aorta won't work unless you're running a supported Linux kernel.
Torsocks is more platform independant so it works on BSD's.
Or users can write similar packet rules on their BSD boxes
to effectively do what aorta does on Linux.
Whonix and various VM solutions do similar things.
Tries to resolve and connect to an onion, prints results, exit on fail.
Runs your app without such test first.

If considering as yet non tor daemon, non measured, non consensus voted

cable/dsl/fiber "home" relays, country locations, opposing legal jurisdictions,
operation by "known" or "trusted" operators / entities or not, by
working / fake / no
contact info, by any PKI Web Of Trust asserted among operators, funding
sources, employer / corporate / political / other affiliations,
statistical analysis
of historical relay "presence" on the network (add/drop/uptime, nicknames,
movement, versions, bulk turnups, correlation groups, etc), and many more
possible metas that people should think up and add to this list.
That research then followed by development of third party subscription
lists of categorized / ranked relays the user or tor daemon may further
pluggably select from when choosing nodes to path through.
There have been posts on tor-relays@ and tor-talk@ that mention more
about these sorts of meta parameters. AFAIK, no one has done any
research into them or their potential impact / benefits, whether to particularly
affected, or for plain preferential choice users, or to the network as a whole.

Folks in convo before have covered some of these areas
and more that one could surely find or think of...
Why does someone want to support and develop for Tor, or any other
overlay p2p anonymity network, or crypto, for that matter?
When even a fix to the manpage could be read and used by onion users
and operators, same for metrics, lists, or any other part of the ecosystem.
Does one fear "bad" things, association, or support "good" things?
Does freespeech, anonymity, privacy, human rights sound "good"?
What is "bad"? Censorship? Theft, Dictatorships, Police States,
whether one's own, that of the Enemy, or that of the Oppressed?
Cryptocurrency, anonymity, free markets, privacy, messaging... "bad"?
"Good" [only] when used to defeat "bad" things inside or outside
of [mal]functional democracies that assert majority force over
minorities who have forced no one? Ricochet, Signal, GPG... "bad"?
New technology that forces change over old entrenched ways... "bad"?
Are anonymous forums where professional therapists give pro bono
counseling to even the most reviled, depraved, criminal, socially
scarlet lettered and outcast... "bad"? Materials and talk of religion?
Are datamining, traffic archiving, exploits, cleartext... "good"?
Tor has exits... do people realize how much of both what they like
to "support", and abhor, travels over those exits? The variety of
traffic there is no different than onions. Should exits be unsupported?
What about the internet, or printing presses, should those tools
be unsupported? Are they "bad", get their makers looked askew?
Onions, exits, internet, presses, hammers... all simply agnostic
tools. Tools can be used to build great things, to defend, or to
wield in bloody murder.
And what of biases over certain agnostic tools instead of over the
separate "good" or "bad" uses of them? Do other tool builders and
users have to wonder if their tools are being compromised by those
with such biases?
What of when those with biases end up needing the tools themselves,
what will be the tool quality, or their ability to do "good" with them?
Have people taken the time to explore the onion space to find and
participate in all the "good" things they like therein, to create and
grow them, or even engage in counsel and advocacy against the "bad"?
What tools would be needed to do that?
Yes, people are free to work on what they like...
including giving deep thought as to what they like and don't, and
why, and how supporting agnostic tools can actually fit with that.
Are not your pens tools?
Who likes those?
Who supports those?
What if they didn't?
Pens... write code.
Tech, fun, politic...
Amounting to consideration feature X may prevent or diminish a
better archictecture on balance for some higher importance feature Y.
That should be covered open devops as usual.
Or if the *technology* or *code* of eg: eepsites onions, or other
subsets of various projects are not in their interest or knowledge

Or if the features provided by any overlay network or tool are
deemed flawed, and the technical or political effort to get them
fixed, or rearchitecture, or correctly advertised, or called out
within as bunk, is too high, therein it may be better to abandon
them and or speak out freely as such.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How do tor users get past the recapacha and it's 
Opensource is good.
The above two answers appear to be in conflict.
JS itself doesn't do that.
Cookies, from and restricted to the site itself, are fine, the user
can manage their sessions with the site.
If reviews hold, and it never gets backdoored by whoever later on.
Both good and bad can come from human and bot.
The list of three tech above does not address that.
In fact, there are no humans or computers evaluating, moderating,
or even terminating, any user metrics or content ongoing in depth
with a site anywhere in the list above. The list is just stupid low
effort uncreative kneejerk... captcha solved, or not. Pathetic.
Meanwhile the captcha's get solved (and coookies loaded,
JS interpreted, extensions calculated) and the fun continues.
And Tor users still have to (if not outright blocked) wade through
say up to 100 clicks over 10 puzzles, multiple resets over in some
cases, to in some cases still end up getting censored the ability
to simply READ the world's text. That's wrong...
In this and former threads some people suggested various other / more
effective and humane solutions than a dumb front door lock.
And there are some projects detailing others...

History shows that method always loses long term.
Tools themselves will not stop the continual foisting that always wins
long term.
Note this UK US scam has been spooling up for a wider G7 drop for a while now...
The subject problem is that government is now redundant to your own better
capabilities as human beings, now evolved and connected to the wealth of
instant global knowledge and comms. There's no longer a need for such a
central store of knowledge, action, and programming that, among other things,
says that murder and theft are good, since now you can go online and see
that it is plainly bad, and contribute to better together, directly.
The solution is thus to go further this time and finally discontinue
that old redundant system.
That connectedness is a "mob rule" they speak of... more properly a
"decentralized" mode, with voluntarist, anarchist, libertarian
flavors, coordinated
under realtime feedback for good... an unexpected result (to their geriatric
selves and their decades expired models and thinking) of the true power
of the Internet now arrived... a curiously interesting process taking shape
globally... a discussion.. an exploration of alternative models, of local
and self governance, an elimination of redundancy and inefficiency,
reclamation and redeployment of all things ceded.
So of course they want to "Digital ID" that, to censor it, balkanize, shape,
track, control, criminalize, and shut it down.... before they themselves are.
The fact that they've resorted to deploying worldwide surveillance,
the Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse FUD and more, spinning
it out 24x365 nonstop now in survival mode, shows they know their
own end is coming.
Make, keep and use tools... "systems that help protect privacy and
anonymity online... develop new privacy friendly services etc"...
not just to hide and shield from the foisting, but to fix and learn
new thinking, thus ending it for good.
The math is simpler than crypto...

"American spies were also working to crack Liberty Reserve"
"analysts have .. tracked down senders / receivers of Bitcoin"

"using this “browsing product,” which “the NSA can then exploit.”
"These programs involve ventures with US companies."

cyber targets that utilize online e-currency services...
There’s no elaboration on who is considered a “cyber target.”
that the NSA would “launch an entire operation ... under false
pretenses” just to track targets is “pernicious,” ... Such a practice
could spread distrust of privacy software in general, particularly in
areas like Iran where such tools are desperately needed by dissidents.
This “feeds a narrative that the U.S. is untrustworthy,”
"Despite Bitcoin’s reputation for privacy... you should really lower
your expectations of privacy on this network.”
financial privacy “is something that matters incredibly” to the
Bitcoin community, and expects that “people who are privacy conscious
will switch to privacy-oriented coins” after learning of the NSA’s
work here.
If the government’s criminal investigations secretly relied on NSA
spying, that would be a serious concern. Individuals facing criminal
prosecution have a right to know how the government came by its
evidence, so that they can challenge whether the government’s methods
were lawful. That is a basic principle of due process. The government
should not be hiding the true sources for its evidence in court by
inventing a different trail.
Civil liberties advocates have long suspected that the Justice
Department is underreporting Section 702 cases in order to limit court
challenges to the controversial law. Some theorize that the government
conceals Section 702 use through a process known as “parallel
construction,” in which evidence obtained from the warrantless
surveillance authority is reobtained through traditional FISA
authorization, and the government only discloses the latter authority
in U.S. District Court. One defense lawyer referred to this practice
in a court filing as “laundering” Section 702 evidence.
The government intercepts Americans’ emails and phone calls in vast
quantities using this spying law and stores them in databases for
years,” said Patrick Toomey, staff attorney for the American Civil
Liberties Union’s National Security Project. “FBI agents around the
country then go searching through that trove of data as a matter of
course, including in domestic criminal investigations.
If the FBI uses parallel construction to conceal intelligence
community information, it would not be the only federal law
enforcement agency doing so. In 2013, Reuters obtained documents from
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration that showed how agents were
trained to “recreate” investigative trails to conceal how intelligence
intercepts helped to identify criminal targets.

Not really...
Many Tor users use cryptocurrencies.
Many cryptocurrency users have little clue as to the
extremely limited privacy most cryptocurrencies offer.
This makes it an important topic of awareness
for Tor users on tor-talk.
The continuous attacks and analysis upon the blockchains by
dataminers, marketers, lawful and unlawful government agencies
including law enforcement, taxation, NSA style GPA / GAA / parallel
construction, questionable untested new "laws", corporations, status
quo anti-adoption efforts, internet censors, DPI filters, researchers,
even other users... all around the world... is at least on the same
level as that against anonymous overlays like tor, and even clearnet
Most of the cryptocurrencies out there...
- don't use TLS, thus their entire networks have zero
privacy / auth / integrity over the end to end transport
- don't use internal cryptoprivacy to protect transaction info
- don't have communities much aware of or using overlay
networks, out of band comms, encryption
- don't really care much about privacy in the currency itself
- don't have clients that directly support, or services that reside
on, overlay networks. This includes exchanges, miners and
mining pools, relays / nodes, payment gateways, forums,
wallets, DAOs, etc.
So if you're a tor user for reasons, and want a cryptocurrency
that demonstrates similar reasons / capabilities, your choices
are limited. And there's a lot of lingering 'cryptocurrency is private'
promotion from earlier days left to dispel and to re-evaluate.
If you want to follow / try / contribute to some recent
developments in stronger cryptocurrency privacy search out
- privacy coins
- decentralized exchanges
- even older forms might be noted / useful such as...
coin mixes, blenders, swaps, joinmarket, etc
Zcash ZEC, BitcoinPrivate BTCP, Monero XMR,
Zencash ZEN (uses TLS), Bisq exchange, etc
Though evaluating them might be off topic,
since tor users are likely to have interest in
cryptocurrency privacy feel free to list / link more
cons / services / evals that you find in this thread

directly used as a "live" system without "installing" it.
Write it to a 16G USB, boot it, add some more
ZFS partitions and customize it from there.
Or "install" it to a second USB which is also "live".
They don't preload the base images with their
own idea of app sets, in fact /usr/local is empty
for you to choose what you want... X, window manager,
shells, browser, MUA, etc.
There's around 31,000 prebuilt application packages.
Choose your list and 'pkg install '
each one.
The latest versions of all those mentioned are in there...
Tor 0.3.2.10
OpenVPN 2.4.5
OpenJDK 8.162.12
I2P 0.9.33
Freenet - Not yet, but as with I2P, grabbing the jar
and following the docs is easy enough.
Also mentioned was 'kenel hardening', 'secure OS',
and 'slick'... a bit meaningless without further
explicit example, use case, threat model.
People can join HardenedBSD, TrustedBSD,
create new, or use as is after seeing what's there.
OpenBSD is pretty awesome too.
With OPNsense, TrueOS and FreeNAS, DragonflyBSD,
NetBSD, NAS4Free making up most of the rest of the
current general and specific use space you can search out.
Yes one problem with "linux" is you have to learn both the
way of linux *and* the way of whichever distro on top is
pulling the fragmented bazaar together, then maybe discover
the first random distro out of dozens is not a good fit,
or the distro guts and remodels itself on a whim, then take
a shot at another random distro... a lot of time wasted on
the distro layer alone. Do that problem two or three times

Well you need to define the threat model. But generally,
encryption alone over clearnet is insufficient to do that.
It needs run over an anonymity network to hide the participants.

Exits shutting themselves down upon analysis of assault upon their own

are handy there, though perhaps a bit naieve to expect a domain redirection
attack via dns servers would go to the same ip's as wildcard advertising,
instead of simply being different ip's than expected).
Censoring jacked NXDOMAIN back to users isn't, certainly not without user
option, as would be any other filter in their end where it belongs (other
than for tor-resolve queries which can be both, this probably needs
done via cell bits).
Further, hiding this evil will allow it to fester and grow on the global
internet by blinding users who might otherwise discover, learn about it,
where it is coming from, get pissed off, and rise and protest against it
so that it goes away for real.

That being said...
There are many ways...
- Start laying fiber / wifi to your neighbors, guerrilla networking, create
your own new global internets with your own new rules
- CJDNS, I2P, GNUnet, Tor, messaging ... all the various anonymous
encrypted overlays... they are their own "non ISP networks"...
run your own services on them, they're likely better than nothing.
- Do you really need to be giving Alexa Top 100 access to your life
and asshole... especially anymore now that decentralized models
and software are rolling out...
As far as this BGP event, as someone noted earlier,
commercial [subscription based] "security" services deploy many
potential means for themselves and their customers, including acting within
their routing infrastructures, to blackhole / filter / snoop traffic destined
to external risks deemed. No different than adblock, "hosts" files, etc.
So long as it's not default deny, packets can still get out,
somewhere, to the equivalent of bridges / vpn's / proxies as need be.
Their explanation is within plausible ops legitimacy.
As is questioning trust in aforesaid entities... you certainly
can't do an inspection on either of them, yet you still give
them your dollars. That's quite funny.
Again, more interesting would be looking for and
analysing attacks against the tor nodes (and those
of other networks) as a whole.
Unfortunately no one's researched that yet here.
Perhaps because Tor [izens] keeps shouting "sniffing bad",
thus programming out one of the tech needed to do that.
And other attacks, such as potential bgp steering,
sybils, the network paths, etc, are also less discussed [1].
Or because coordination is hard.
Oh well... Demons lurk where Sun never peeks.
At least tor doesn't use dns to bootstrap and run,
that would be a whole other layer of attack surface.
[1] For example, after years of mentions, there's still
no voluntary meetup PKI WoT cross certification / inspection /
identification, statistical / checklist, jurisdiction / AS / location,
whatever else, based node analysis and selection project to which
users could potentially subscribe their clients to. All networks to date
still use effectively random free-for-all node selection. That's reasonable
in some threat models, but without the research and attempted
construction and deployment of alternate selection models
operating voluntarily in parallel... it's quite possibly a lurkers paradise.

"Resists" or "makes harder / costlier" may be better terms.
It might be possible to prevent such attacks by adding

so tor will remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit that.
And to Sybil attacks... cost raisers there have been suggested

other 20 peers are listed here:
It runs in a Debain 8.11 Docker container, which is hosted in a Debain
9.6.0 KVM domain, and that in turn is hosted on a Ubuntu 18.10 KVM
VPS. Iptables rules at VPS and KVM domain levels block all Internet
access except through Tor and OnionCat.I'll check it periodically. If
someone has broken it, I'll restart the Docker container. If someone
has managed to break the KVM domain, I'll restore that from backup.
And if someone has gone the extra mile to break the VPS, I'll restore
that from backup.
This may seem bizarre to privacy lovers. I mean, I could be logging
everything! But the point is providing easy-to-use access to Freenet
that's secured from third parties. If you decide that it's worth the
hassle, I recommend running your own node, connecting through OnionCat
IPv6 peers. Or through I2P GarlicCat peers, if you like.
While I could be logging everything, that's arguably more-or-less
irrelevant, because Tor renders you and the node mutually anonymous.
Not perfectly anonymous, true. But there's arguably little risk,
unless you and/or the node have been targeted. Just be prudent.
Especially be prudent about downloading files from the node. I
recommend using Whonix, on a machine with full-disk encryption. Or
Tails, with encrypted USB storage.

Cottonmouth, revealed earlier this year in the leaks of Edward
Snowden. The device, which hid in a USB peripheral plug, was
advertised in a collection of NSA internal documents as
surreptitiously installing malware on a target’s machine. The exact
mechanism for that USB attack wasn’t described. “I wouldn’t be
surprised if some of the things [Nohl and Lell] discovered are what we
heard about in the NSA catalogue.”
The alternative is to treat USB devices like hypodermic needles.
Nohl says he and Lell reached out to a Taiwanese USB device maker,
whom he declines to name, and warned the company about their BadUSB
research. Over a series of emails, the company [Phison] *repeatedly
denied* that the attack was possible.

governance, participation, etc. There's a lot more that goes into
that. All of which various parts of the overall community
(corp, dev, users, operators, funders, etc) also hold various
opinions on (re DA's), no different than any other project.
In overall re: design / subject of DA's... it's thought by most
around Tor, a reasonably sound and working model, resistant
to at least casual attack en masse, at least so far as any
attack is publicly known to have occurred.
Also keep in mind that design of Tor / DA is roughly 20 years
old, thus having elements of both wisdom and legacy.
Worst case?
Full discovery of end to end physical locations,
with concurrent compromise of traffic content.
General network disruption including complete shutdown.
Technical talk has been made over the years on if / should,
and how, the DA's might be eliminated from the design.
If the DA system is thought to be weak to various threats and
attack models, or there's preference for a fully independant,
distributed, and autonomous live network... people might
want to review some of those talks, or draft design changes,
or new overlay networks, or implement ones that are
still in whitepaper form [waiting for a dev team].
The Anonbib is one good source for research reading, as
are the materials and communities of other overlay networks.
Note also that most things "who, where, threat models"
regarding the DA's also apply to all the relays. And
there is not necessarily any PKI WoT, comms, or in person
relations between any given whole or subset[s] of them.
Perhaps there should be, or not, or in part, and why / how...
And that such subject questions, and their many fine and
possible answers surely both here and before from many folks,
are not unique to Tor... all the open overlay networks exhibit
at least some similar elements.
The code and networks are still active so... ignoring unknown
conspirators, malactors, Sybils, GPA / GAA, [quantum]
cryptanalysis, parallel constructions, etc... perhaps things
in the space are thought good enough. Or not.
One should never rest, because your adversaries will not.
It's a big space, there's always room for new ideas,
[better] solutions to old, hard, and new threats,
incorporating new tools and strategies that didn't
exist before, etc.
Have fun :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Let's not keep rehashing the past, 
Of course, corporations and people can and do change all the time.
Corps, often when bought / sold, or with top level staff changeover.
People, whenever upon some new thought process / info / situation.
And they often change back as well.
And they're not really involved with them under CF plan either.
So they might be missing out on some oppurtunities to
directly learn and participate in some neat things about
tor / philosophies.
Perhaps it is fully informed choices that should be respected.
Not necessarily degress of blind ones presented by want to be
saviours that might trend saying say "Tor bad" to sell product.
Is the suggested accepted gone-ness of that phase now qualified
by its current censorship actions.
Is it not good that there is now such a global rapid response
awareness and capability forming to tackle censorship,
privacy, human rights, and other abuses by States, Religion,
and Corporations as they happen in real time.
Which mistakes are ultimately rightly resolved as oops with
no lasting effect.
At least the capability is excercised peacefully without physical
force, no one dies. Unlike murder and other things by the trio
above, and even just peoples too.
Right, and the above two stories are wins for both the
sites and users, and many tech toolsets, and philosophy.
However that's still rare, the historical pattern remains...
1) Users of site X notice or want something and say so openly
in constructive engagement, or at least initial friendly query.
2) Site X ignores them, many times because they have no
protocol to even talk with users, no interfacers, it's not in
their biz plan / vision, or manageable, cut expenses, clam up.
3) Users escalate.
Many of us have been deep in enough Site X's to know
that (2) is the hard problem.
There is a curious divide between vision / profit, and users.
Maybe this blockchain thingy enables micro share and
stake holding, and governance, to bridge it. Who knows.
Not sure that letsencrypt does this yet, if not, they should.
Yes Jacob Appelbaum et al's work resulting in RFC7686 was good.
Too bad a number of other efforts got jammed / quit,
because I2P and other overlay networks are a thing now too.
Too bad CJDNS is still improperly overloading upon address space
that IANA has explicitly allocated for other purposes, causing
collisions and general non-interoperability. Least they could
do if they can't get an allocation, or could have done, is camped
on some unallocated, and unlikely to ever be used, space instead.
So there's always things userland [projects] can do better
to play nice. (Well above was mostly technical example.)
Onionland has always been respectable from day one,
only the nonrespectable disrespected it.
And dark web has never been a lie, or a myth,
though perhaps indeed a legendary thing.
Even at its supposed worst maybe driving change
in the face for good.
Other overlay networks are More Secure Web too.
Unless that too is trademarked and sic'd upon.
Those open spaces exist, things compete in it, so capitalize
above it and win.
Recounting things can be useful, not because they
note any particular actors in example, but because they
note the sort of things any person or entity might want
to look out for before letting something new, and
similarly afflicted, grow bigger without first being fixed.
Arbitrarily killing speech, when there's [almost] nowhere
left for speakers to speak, is pretty fucking lame.
CF did that, so now others are too, seemingly spurred.
And speech around the world suffers.
Perhaps a fair number here like free speech zones
and social credit scores too. Perhaps they've just not
seen enough postings decrying that to change their
minds otherwise. Perhaps such postings were chilled
and censored.
What seems a big CF onion celebration here could easily
have unanalyzed pitfalls, whether currently, or upon
change of mind later on...
Here's a couple...
a) Analysis / Attack
1) Grand excuse and cover for floating the immense number
of nodes needed on the hashring... very convenient for
analysis and exploit attacks, including by their NSA CIA LE
and / or other unknown partners / researchers.
2) Terminating colossal numbers of circuits
into their AS and or administrative realm for
observation / similar.
3) Even unwittingly creating easy locus for GPA / GAA.
b) Key material
1) Holding onion names hostage in [non] custodial /
contractual form, whether they give subscribers
the [offline] crypto keys, or sell / rent / extort them,
portability, multihoming.
2) Security aganst keytheft breach and subsequent
impersonation of the sites from behind 7 proxies,
phishing, etc. Compensation for site and user losses.
Consideration of (a) alone should chill this party out a bit.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor VoIP PBX Architecture Discussion 
OnionCat can provide access to using UDP and IPv6
over Tor without the extra openssh openvpn layers.
Onion to onion sets an average range of RTT due
to hopcount and speed of light. Software layers
add on top of that.
Those widely deploying onioncat / onionvpn should be
aware of some caveats and good future oppurtunities...
- Users have to compile and run them, they may not
be as available platform wide as openvpn / ssh.
That's minor since joint effort with those projects can be started
to port, document, and publish them [and their binaries again], etc.
- They're IPv6 only, that's minor, expected and ok since everyone
has local IPv6 stacks and apps now and IPv6 is the way forward.
[The encapsulated IPv4 mode is a hack, use IPv6 instead.]
- Doesn't yet work with v3 onion services automagically.
Tor may require an address resolution / translation layer
to do that, which would probably also end up handling
hostnames naming layer as a bonus.
This is a big oppurtunity for anyone who wants to design it :)
- Tor is thinking to kill off v2 onion services despite all the
uses and users of IPv6 and UDP via onioncat / onionvpn.
There is a trac ticket somewhere to continue v2 onion
services in perpetuity, with various levels of support, up
to and including fork of tor client and or network.
Continuation is a fine middle ground.
A few of the related tickets...
There are some communities using bittorrent, voice comms,
and other applications for many years, entirely within onionland,
via onioncat, onionvpn, udp, ipv6. So the tech works pretty good :)
See also...
search: the lists for "onioncat", there are detailed posts that
 could be collated for reference by those working on things.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor VoIP PBX Architecture Discussion / Onioncat 
Apps like VoIP, IRC, shell could all benefit from that selection.
Tor doesn't proffer path selection for valid reasons, so probably
won't anytime soon. Third parties might be able to develop
a controller plugin scheme for it, including as a byproduct,
even more metrics that one might wish to also choose nodes
based upon, trust, etc.
These data might generated from already cached HS descriptors,
so initiating a call to uncached would take somewhat longer.
Typically under 2s init, which is fine for any use case.
See the config options to reduce the hop count
in the path controlled by the onion service side.
The client chooses their own side.
Not much.
That's arbitrary.
Alternatively users can say, and Tor can listen... "Onioncat provides
good feature capabilities not provided by anything else, we're using
this, it works for us, or it's a nice feature capability that others can
use, we're aware of tradeoffs, we've evaluated our usage, needs,
and threat models, therefore support for it needs to continue, at
least until a replacement arrives".
That's fair.
Referring explicitly to v3 HS desc... and without truncation,
generation, registration, mapping or other schemes... sure.
However, no... IPv6 address width is long enough for use cases where
it is long enough and not long enough for other use cases where
it is not.
Different use cases might select different strengths based on needs.
Bittorrent users don't need lifetime / PQC level authentication
between peers, they just need enough to prevent nuisance
collisions from degrading operations. Today even the less
than 32 bits of IPv4 (reality: users don't typically brute the ISPs)
are working just fine for that, and the 80 bits over Onioncat will
be sufficient for that for forseeable future. Where they need many
more equivalent bits of strength is likely in encryption, integrity,
and anonymity, not authentication.
Voice and video talkers also might not need lifetime / PQC
resistant authentication when they have additional bits
available to them through hearing and seeing and the
context of the conversation ratchet with their peer[s].
And they can repeat for integrity. But they might want
strong encryption and anonymity. Same for IRC.
Yes, strive to deploy the longest lengths and best accepted
algorithms universally wherever possible, just keep in mind
use cases exist that are quite happy to move all the sliders
around in order to meet their own overall needs.
Yes, one cannot rationally overload all 128 bits for that without colliding
upon allocated IPv6 space that may appear in one's host stack.
However the 1:1 key network can be larger than 80 bit. One could
easily play with up to say 125 bits by squatting on entirely
unallocated space. (Unlike the clear mistake CJDNS made by
squatting on space already allocated for a specific and conflicting
real world in stack purpose.) Obviously the common library widths
of 96 and 112 could be keyed. And request could be made for a
formal allocation if compatibility and compliance was felt needed
by some mental gymnastics.
256 bit equivalent strength for all keys and algos including PQC,
represented into addressing... ok, push it through the IETF just
like .onion was.
While you're at it, don't forget to push both...
1) PFS per link encryption, with PQC option
2) chaff fill to the full link rate
... in all switch and router and MAC PHY hardware,
automatically on by default, on every interface, out of the box.
Add to that pushing  and  , etc
so that you know what you're getting.
Lots of options and ideas here have been and can be
further solicited researched and developed. Search
the lists for Onioncat to find some of them, or generate
your own.
People would like IPv6 and UDP (even raw IP) transport because
their host stacks support it, the internet is moving to it,
many applications simply don't speak .onion or torify poorly,
and it's an interesting capability to plug into other things.
Whether in Tor or some other existing or new network,
try getting together to develop it, or white papering why it
cannot be done in any network ever. Whichever outcome,
any good research there would be a useful addition
to the set other projects might reference in developing
their own work.

A more generalized subject for whoever,

most don't see because they never spend any time in it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Onionland: Bittorrent, VoIP, Gaming, P2P, Biz, Mosh, IRC, 
As to width, not really. As before, for the forseeable future regarding
the cost to generate collisions into 2^80 compared to the planet's
population, Bittorrent, over otherwise acceptably resistant overlay
networks, simply has no need for stronger authentication of
nodes than that. Worst case any bad blocks and bad talkers
will be rejected by existing torrent protocols. That's for the
public network. Private BT nets (corp, gov, friends, whatever)
have other means of restriction, PSK, VPN, etc.
And if someone does waste 80 bits of their time colliding
your bittorrent address, just generate another onion on
the fly and you're back on in seconds leaving them with
a nasty electric bill and nothing to show for it.
For purely "non exit" use, as with I2P, tor + Onioncat is
perfectly suitable to needs of today's bittorrent users
regarding node authentication bit width.
Again, that's a completely arbitrary talking point based
on Tor's mommy coddling of the end user initiative.
That's certainly ok, go ahead, push v3 and all the latest
advances everywhere, no problem, that's actually a good
and noble thing.
However it is also *not* a valid excuse to drop v2,
which currently backs UDP IPv6 transport,
for those users and groups that have done the
analysis regarding their own use cases for v2.
In fact, given a v2 mode is sustainable not to the detriment
of v3 or future vX, such arbitrary statements against v2
end up looking silly. Even if it were detrimental to future
architecture it could be refactored to cohabitate with it
and for easier longer term support.
Hard to say the strength. Looking at the numbers of
torrenters worldwide, their need for continued operations,
the big indexes and trackers now residing in overlay
networks, the constant crackdowns against the nonfree
copyright subsector on clearnet... if any significant fraction
of them woke up, the influx would be more than enough to
fork the net for the purpose of a new free haven for
torrenting alone.
Related RFC: ORCHIDv2
That assumes that greater than any given width (from
the plausible range of 80 to 125) is needed for all use cases.
As before, for bittorrent, and human convo, it's probably not.
And for the applications where it is, well, people have been
musing solutions on the lists for years, but not devoting time
to developing a working solution as a project.
"AF_ONION" has been suggested among many other potential
solutions. However as said, you're talking major 3rd party work...
libraries, compilation, and runtime options added to all software,
whereas essentially all software is IPv6 today, or there in near term.
Unlike torify and packet redirection, that AF is not a trivial solution.
And everyone knows that tor is not and will not be the only overlay.
Thus the software world will not accept all that work just for your
own little AF_ONION pet. Any AF_* effort would work *only* if it
was done as a wide and generic AF_OVERLAY... a library shim
that can talk to whatever overlay transports of the day, even
concurrently.. And such AF_OVERLAY work, being larger than tor,
would rightly likely be homed in independant working group elsewhere.
NCP was dropped as a comms protocol in the early 80's.
Perhaps protocol and fundamental design elements of both
tor and that of other overlay networks will be dropped for
new ones in the near future as well. Nothing lasts forever,
and most today's networks aren't very resistant to today's
AI GPA. Three hops circuit extension seems dated to
defeating other primary attack classes of their day. And
today it is very unlikely that advanced GPA is the
laughable conjecture of yesteryear.
Yes please.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Strong Flow Correlation Attacks on Tor Using Deep 
Tor has some work towards added padding, but it might be insufficient
against GPA's and GAA's on the wire, which are ultimately the
more general form of these analysis.
And it might not be network wide yet,
nor regulated, accounted for under negotiated parameters, depeered
upon unexpected behaviour, saturated, reclocked, jittered, etc.
Sprinkling a little noise around might not hide the greater
elephant crashing about the room that is your traffic.
Today, if an analyst can pick any node, and characterize / learn / AI
its traffic, even generate and be its traffic... all they have to do to
discover the other end is to search any other node with the same
parameters in their traffic DB. That's doable, and fatal.
The only defense seems to be having random / rigorous traffic
that users ride within, and are mutually interested in maintaining
and enforcing that traffic layer for their own defense, accepting
that they'll need to supply and dedicate a portion of their network
link to it, etc.
This seems more suited to somewhat reducing ease / odds
of analysis by Sybil, aka: Trust in Nodes, Good:Bad Node
Ratio / Odds, etc.
Both GPA / GAA and Sybil can use similar analysis and attacks,
as well as their own unique ones.
However, if Sybil has knowledge and access to internal layers,
which is the case with most networks that try to be more
smart / efficient than broadcast, Node Trust won't likely be solved
by inband solutions like GPA / GAA above might, you'll have to
jump out to human solutions for that... Know Your Nodes...
... who and hardware, where physically / logically including jurisdiction,
funding, OS, public inspection verification, subscriptions to node sets
that meet whatever desired parameters, or exclude / include unknowns,
realworld P2P PKI structures, anal probing, etc.
For example, while a 1000 node, just download launch and play,
network might easily be secured against external traffic analysis,
it would miserably fail at Sybil resistance without Know Your Nodes.
There's also combination of Know Your Nodes with node count odds,
or just node count odds alone, such that adversaries deployment count
of Sybil costs so much that they can't reach but say 10-100 per 100M users.
Regarding those concepts of protection from Sybil, no network today
comes anywhere close to KYN or, and or with, those node count odds.
The *entire space* of Overlay / Messaging / P2P networks needs
to seriously consider anew the conceivable and operational correlation,
timing, statistical, etc attacks up to and including complete GPA
analysis, even GAA and Sybil, being deployed by Agencies and
Entities against them. And the space needs to make clear to
[prospective] end users what classes of attacks they're aware of,
and what they're claiming to mitigate or not. In part because, unlike
being just those in the space before, post-Snowden, a world's worth
of average users are becoming more aware and seeking solutions.
And older tech and thinking that doesn't really address today needs
cannibalized to allow for new efforts.
We're not in 1999 with CARNIVORE and Napster P2P anymore.
We're in 2025 with the All Seeing All Acting Eye...

outside the Tubes as well.

Models, threats, and use cases all being tested
and mashed together is good, and fun to do :)
Sybil is extremely hard to protect against and root out,
since all Sybil needs is Money, and an Excuse to be there.
As noted in tor lists since years, the solution to Sybil
might not be as complete with only "in network" methods.
It will more likely require at least some in real life Web of Trust,
Humans asserting over the nodes they run, the software
analysing that web, making node selections based on
that metadata.
"I know her, she works at the store, he's at my
meetup group, they're a local company, etc...",
and so on, a mesh of persons to persons, running
nodes and fiber, all around the planet.
You're probably going to need to force Sybil to
become a verifiable IRL Human Being...
because right now all she needs is money,
and her bags are full of it.
In a 1 million node network, if half of the nodes are
from WoT verified humans, each human runs 10 nodes,
and only 50% the users prefer to make exclusive
use of the WoT... that's 25k unique logical nodes now
showing themselves as being more than just a
completely anonymous potentially adversarial
[point] source of money renting out boxes around
the globe.
Can 2.5% of the nodes making up any of todays
transport, cryptocurrency, or application network
overlays be said to be sufficiently trusted?
Do any even need to be?
In addition to signing human WoT data in the network
layers, you could also start pushing analysis of node
metadata into subscribable routing metrics... where
are the nodes located, OS, uptime patterns, spec
conformance, degrees of WoT such as non IRL nyms,
and how strong each asserters verification and assertion
policy framework is, etc.
All of this and more could raise Sybil's cost and
exposure risk qute significantly, perhaps to futility.
Everytime the Sybil WoT subject hits the lists
it's met with abject silence [or "Johnny can't..."]
Is this due to fear of associating with a node
(or trying to protect the node by not associating)
such that if the node is taken down the operator
can walk away or redeploy anon elsewhere?
Is that not what Zero Knowledge is for, to allow everyone
immunity to say "It's just bits, we have no knowledge or control"?
Are advancements toward solving Vampire and Sybil
really thought that horrifically "unusable" and "costly"?
Or that some won't find them perfectly acceptable?
Are the elevated levels of technical, philosophical,
educational, and operational participation potentially
required all nodes and any solutions thought to be
impossible to achieve?
Is it easier to just skate by on the odds and
continue throwing the victims under the bridge
as acceptable losses?
Not meaning to have refer to Loki, or any project, but to all nets...
We know that, other than routine protocol, code, and
human exploits (those three all still being quite sufficient at times),
adversaries remaining credible tools against Overlay Networks
themselves seem to be Vampire and Sybil. And fake Law, no?
It's not only State Actors... any global, regional, or even local
tier-n ISP can be an adversary partner Vampire... all you
need is to be, or have access to, some pipes... and a
willingness to be, or be friendly to, some power, or to
wish to gain from your own Vamping.
And any NGO or person can be a Sybil... all that
takes is money, and in many cases, amusingly little.

a bit of talk on the metas is good now and then.

Why do adversaries do that to their opponents?
Because it's a simple and effective diversion operation.
Nor is it dependant upon whether any "malicious intent".
Adversaries often fund their opponents to keep them busy and happy
even if opponent only a few steps tangent behind the race to actually
being able to kill the adversary. It can work actively...
"Here's a pile and stream of money to develop some useless
or thing we want in an RFP / contract / grant / employee",
or passively... "Hey, those guys seem to be going down useless
paths, ok here's a bunch of money to keep them happily digging
in those holes, LOL." Usually delivered by false fronts.
See also "regulatory capture" type of concept. Also how nice
salaries and simple weight of self reinforcing mass inertia and
groupthink over time can keep any one or group settled into the
same thing, less dynamism, up to even not abandoning and starting
out elsewhere due to simple risk aversion... "job food friends lifestyle."
Is an entity, product, or network subject to whatever
to some degree or other? Maybe, maybe not, others decide.
Yet without talking about and analysing harder questions
once in a while, especially as generations come and go,
people might have less sense therein.
If a site looks sexy it must be good, right?
That's what at least marketers think, and it's perhaps good enough
for browsing mundane TV news sites. Yet there's no frontpage
splash disclaimer for others with more sensitive, vulnerable,
or different use cases.
Nor mention of Tor people hypocritically trying to censor ban
nodes out of the consensus for, ironically, nothing more than
excercising their right to free speech. Instead of say punting that
out to meta analysis projects that users can choose to subscribe
to as suits their own likes, support, and thinking therein.
To be fair, no different than any other business (say ibm.com)
or opensource project... finding much suitability disclaimer
on anyone's pages, surely not without a good number of clicks,
it's of less interest or natural to cover some potentially
questionable areas, adversarial weaknesses, etc... it doesn't sell.

Never mind that AU, NZ, UK are all busy right this

Highly capable Global Adversaries are well known to exist.
TOP SECRET friends may perhaps be the friends of few, often
end up generally corruptive, less than stellar, an uncertainty, etc...
thus really shouldn't be kept or created. Seek out better ways.
That's another problem with large projects, like corporate and
government monopolies, they can suck up all the air in the room...
needed and valuable diversity, competition, and evolution gets
starved out, groupthink herd monoculture etc sets in generations.
In the space of critical use case anonymity, privacy, messaging
tools, crypto utility application overlay networks, cryptocurrency,
etc... a space too new to have enough breadth and depth of research
paths dreamed up and exhausted so as to begin to see what works,
to advise with confidence, or not... that would not be good at all.
Tor... circuit based encrypted onion routing tcp with quasi decentral
human roots of authority... is a done architecture model since 20 years,
its wholesale novel development research covered in its early whitepapers.
Researchers hoping for big architecture breakthroughs against
adversaries, should probably investigate other potential and new
solutions elsewhere.  Even if only filling in currently uncovered
use cases, on up to addressing current and expected evolution in
adversaries, there is a lot of fun work to do out there beyond Tor.
As for Tor, there is much left... tickets, UI, Web, Phone, optimization,
obfuscation, their own "community", waging part in the overall pro
privacy freedom speech crypto war, all sorts of research, improvements,
and publication on how its network architecture is doing in vivo, where
it's useful and not, ongoing operations... the long tail of Tor,
same as any project.
Tor gets so much money some said Tor could throw a bunch of
it into an independant overlay competition fund. But since such
parent child separation is not achievable, it is the donors who would
need to start that up on their own, and the newer diverse projects
who can consider accepting it.
Like any other project, Tor is great at what it does well,
yet those areas are *not* unlimited.
This is not Kansas, it's Overlay Land, a land known to be
considered for use by those with more critical / different
needs than say, simply browsing the web. [Even then...]
Tor users should see more disclaimer and fair honest analysis,
and less blanket use case superlative coming from Tor.
Indeed sad to whatever extent that does not happen.

No, provided you can get them talking bidirectionally,
users apps run just as well on v2 as they do on v3.
But v3 breaks 1:1 mapping between ipv6 and onion,
and onioncat doesn't yet integrate with hashring or use
some other layer to do addressing lookups. The documented
example is to configure a mesh of static maps... that works
for small numbers of users / services that already
know each other, up until you have to start maintaining
many tens to hundreds in onioncat config. And
P2P apps that interop with random peers don't work.
As an example, try setting up both ping, and then bittorrent
or any other P2P app, over both v2 vs v3 onions, then you
will see what breaks and how painful and limiting
the v3 onioncat hack is to use with P2P.
Actually installing OnionCat and setting up some apps
to run over it will help show better than any words here could.
Either HSv2 support must not be allowed to go away,
or onioncat must be made to work with HSv3.
Otherwise tor permanently loses a major onionland capability.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Onioncat and Tor Hidden Services V3 
To be clear for users...
"deprecation" = arbitrary permanent forced shutdown and removal
of all v2 onions, use cases, applications, user preferences, etc therein.
As to "80-bit" and other v2 vs v3 differences not denoted above
(see "table" below), those aren't actually sufficient reasons
to kill v2, when, again, ...
to evaluation of its features, tradeoffs, security, etc... v2 is
NOT a problem for them.
For example...
Bittorrent file distribution clouds operating entirely within
onionland (no exit).
BT protocol already rejects bad nodes, data that doesn't match
infohash, etc. Also such evaluation will have obviously noted that
BT over any overlay network, is far more resistant to censorship,
even say to MAFIAA for those demonstrating the pointlessness of
Copyright Regimes), etc... than over clearnet. Comparatively speaking,
tor+OnionCat offers a huge win for BT users in some of those areas.
Other P2P protocols may have similar semantics, and enjoy similar
benefits... cryptocurrency, distributed filesystems, YouTube replacements,
VoIP... users already know the voice of their peer, the context
of convo, and other authentication keys. For general non-critical
casual usage... social convos among friends over tor using existing
softphone apps (utilizing: IPv6/UDP)... no one really cares. Being
able to run whatever apps they want over the general protections
afforded by any overlay network is more important.
There are many use cases in which any tradeoffs between
v2 and v3 regarding "80-bit" "presence" "harvesting" etc
are either 100% superceded by the need for IPv6/UDP
in the users particular use case, or are further offset due
to the users use case not needing such levels of security.
That choice is up to the users to make, not Tor.
Rather than arbitrarily killing v2, a better way to go is...
Set v3 to be the default and promoted version.
Bring v2 up to date as close as possible to v3 in
both code diffs and security design semantics.
Split out and modularize v2 wherever it may be entangled
with and holding up other code and design areas.
Provide an unbiased and complete comparison table of
all the v2 vs v3 tradeoffs, features, design, use cases.
Point v2 client and HSDir manpage sections to the table,
ship the table in the docs, onsite, etc.
Relay nodes can participate in supporting the onion
community via their role in v2 HSDir function as always.
Community of v2 could maintain v2 as a module if desired.
Alternatively, create a v4 that can integrate with or provide
what OnionCat does (network interface for raw IPv6 transport
including UDP support over tor onionland).
Tor has a multi-$Million dollar budget, so that's
not much argument against v2 or anything else.
Especially compared to other similar and sized
projects with far less or no funds.
A side layer may develop.
Another overlay network may also do things.
Use cases and acceptable tradeoffs do exist for both v2 and v3.
While that remains the case, killing off either of them would
seem questionable.
Here are some fun use cases for tor, and other overlay networks,
that users are free to build, some of which may require OnionCat...
Have fun :)

There are lots of uses, and ways of using, where people
might be wise to consider not only Tor but all of todays
overlay networks to be unsafe and not suitable for
their needs.
Can users plug all sorts of messengers, browsers,
filesharing, cryptocurrencies, applications into tor... yes.
(If you need UDP or IPv6, then add in OnionCat or VPN.)
Do some use cases for tor and other overlays provide a
layer of some level of additional protection against some
adversary attacks, beyond just raw clearnet... yes.

The mixmaster nodes that multihome with clearnet all

since you're supposd to PGP and crypto over any

Onion for mixmaster, regardless of v2 or v3, is useful
simply for... the direct tor tunnel to server, and since many

is subject to smtp censorship.
There are *many* p2p v2 and v3 onion mail systems.
v2 onions will not be going away or EOL anytime soon.
In part due to needed features and capabilities of v2
not being present in v3 or vN (some of which have
recently again been noted on this list), and other tradeoffs
acceptable to the knowledgeable user, including unwieldy
string length of onion, etc. v3 is good and welcome
improvement for those who need it. Yet it's really and properly

plaintext search and insert interfaces instead of blingy forums and risk.
Tracker - Leet tech that clients connect to to find nodes by infohash,
ie: DHT, PEX, OpenTracker
Client - transmission-bt, vuze, etc
Protected - All traffic stays entirely within the overlay network.
Exit - Some or all traffic may "exit" to clearnet
Yes, and i2p etc too. Yet trackers are just bittorrent tech.
So there are plenty of indexes as well.
Most of the indexes are multihomed from clearnet,
some exist only in the overlays.
Assuming you're using tor+onioncat p2p v2 onions with v2 HSDir
support, that yields ability to transport UDP over IPv6 over tor
(many bittorrent protocols use or require UDP)...
Thus all clients that support IPV6 can work
over "Tor and Onion Addresses".
Native .onion support (TCP only, no IP) is not as simple.
Nor is split horizon exit or full exit.
Same for trying to get TOR space to interop with I2P
space or CJDNS space, client multihoming, etc.
This is moot as typical users don't run their
clients just look at the scrape, they do it to
seed and leech.
Which of course they can do 24x365 over both
tor and i2p, and other overlay networks.
And due to rampant censorship and loss of free speech
on clearnet they are doing it more and more.
See all the recent bans by Youtube, Facebook, Twitter,
etc etc etc.
The overlays are now the only reasonably safe
spaces for free speech to thrive. That's sad.
Users may also want to look at DTube, IPFS,
Brave Browser, BitChute Webtorrent, lists of p2p
apps and overlay networks, distributed file sharing
and storage, blockchain and cryptocurrency, etc
for other ideas and things to read and try.
Lots of new protected overlay networks and apps are
now online, and more will be coming in the years ahead.
Things are changing fast. Plug in and have fun :)

Examples of indexes / forums:
The minimum fields for export / web presentation in any index / forum

Other data, including that contained in legacy .torrent files,
is secondary metadata to primary search and retrieval.
As seen in above examples, even the title fields are
rarely conformant to any minimal spec or format,
and are often childish... so as to make search and
downstream use more difficult and bloated.
Those having control over titles on their own releases,
lint over databases, or operating insertion API's,

Some projects are also now using blockchains as

@_subject: [tor-talk] [tor-relays] Onion v2 HSDir Support (ref: v3 
Right. Feature parity is nice and excellent goal, till
then, and with *no* plan for same on horizon table,
it's about outright removal and killing of long
standing features instead of rightly letting users
choose from among all features to suit their needs.
Killing "..exit" in URI's raised some questions,
and using MAPADDRESS was the nearly functionally
equivalent alternative existing / provided. All good.
Killing v2... whose 80-bit addressing just so happens
to enable appending to an RFC4193 /48 to create
a 128-bit IPv6 space allocation with its inherent UDP all
provided by way of Onioncat and OnionVPN over v2 onions
and v2 HSDir nodes... would rip out accessibility to
***entire classes of transport protocols*** that users,
and their applications, around the world, need to function
properly, and can and do use.
With the main arguments revolving that users are too
stupid to select which of v2 or v3 best suits their needs,
that v2's benefits have no acceptable tradeoffs for them,
That argument should be rejected.
As should others...
Not really.
v2 onion in it's current form has been more
or less coded, done and operational for ~20 years,
minus occaisional bug and enhancement phases.
People have already explained in recent threads how,
after the default out of the box mode for all *new* users
is changed to v3 onions, those with need to use v2 onions
can and will happily explicitly choose v2 and it's tradeoffs,
manually in configs, to support their needs. Those tradeoffs
should be documented onsite and in v2 man sections.
Tor could even make some future release flag,
complain about, and not load any current v2 config
it detecs, directing them to such handholding docs
until they specify "V2YesMommyImABigKidNow=true".
As far as money goes, the Tor Project takes in
$4.2 Million a year. Some of it's people are taking
over $178k a piece, with at least 7 of them receiving
over $100k, and the true volunteers eschewing all.
Those numbers don't include all the slush, side and
decentral funding either.
Where's the 210 coders and others receiving $10k
stipends for half the budget? Where's the open budget
and mechanism? People do inquire this from time to time.
People can start another Subject to comparatively
analyse Tor Project alongside other opensource
network overlays and cryptographic comms projects,
and even other opensource projects in general.
Even start Subjects where other projects could include, remove,
or improve on whatever strategy Tor did to reach $4.2M.
There's no lack of funds in Tor Project.
Let's define this "blocking" as being of v2 HSDir scraping,
not of all the other forms of bad relays. Community volunteers
run the public opensource automated scrape detection and
reporting tools. The weekly config change volunteer DA's
execute based on that is trivial effort. With a bit of logic
it's even automateable.
Yet as above, v2 users do and will soon *explicitly* choose
and accept those tradeoffs. So that's a non argument too.
No. v2 is not some new network tax that just came alone, it's the
first mass version and the entire base of onionland. Load is a ratio.
v2 used to carry 100% of the load since then, and still carries
over 90%. Some crypto is HW accel, some not, in both v2 and v3.
And if that was a metric'd and studied issue, even other 80-bit
algos could be chosen in some long term v2 support release.
No again. Let's define what "scanners" might mean...
Land of v2 and v3 are equally web spidered 24x365, it's HTML, no one
can stop that. Known v3 onions are portscanned just as much as
v2 onions are. If "scanning" means "searching for key collisions
by generating offline", both v2 and v3 are reasonably collision proof to
make that nearly moot. And "scanners" testing generated key lists
for HSDir resolve or TCP connect on the live network will learn in
one day that there is absolutely zero hope there. So that's all moot.
For separate topic of v2 HSDir "scraping" see above.
No. Users have reasons to use, and do and will continue to
select and use v2, even if they have to fork tor. v2 is "used"
by "users" and is thus "user-focused" traffic by definition.
Draw up a list of what needs to be done to make
80-bit v2 support and engineering better. Work to
minimize the diffs between v2 and v3, update whatever
algos and protocols in v2 needs addressed, modularize
and make v2 pluggable (and vN for that matter), call
for extended maintainers, etc.
IPv6 (with inherent UDP) parity for v3 onions (or vN) would be
awesome :-) There have even been a good number of threads
over time where people have suggested ideas on ways to
make that happen. Look them up and start from there.
However parity is not there yet, so no such apps and users
that need to use v2 for it will migrate there, until then.
They will continue to select and use v2 as appropriate.
If's already been decided to make v3 the new default.
And certainly not unreasonable to make v2 require explict
new config to utilize, the placing of a flag to satiate
those benevolents having such concerns for users.
However killing v2 is not really a good option until
something comes along that provides equivalent
of 128-bit IPv6 onion transport (inherently brings UDP),
which is today offered by 80-bit v2 onions HSDir and Onioncat.
Inclusion, informing and information is important.
Don't create confusion by bloating and destroying
valuable Subject header space with stupid list tags,
colossal mistake there made by so many admins
and instead of teaching requestors why it's bad.
Use a good MUA that does proper email threading.
Trim superfluous entries from To and Cc.
Don't top post, don't block quote, don't send HTML, etc...
Put at least some work into all your comms
all the time, that way any occaisional missed or
overridden elements have minimal effect on the
ongoing aggregate sum. Don't be a lazy September fuck.
Draft a proposal for what aspects might go where.
Maybe tor-relays for v2 HSDir support and their
CPU specific bits of the subject.
Yet the overall topic and conversation is much larger.
Until it gets figured out, sorted into whatever workbins,
what goes where... some inclusion and crossing now
and then is in fact efficient, useful, and won't blow up
the world :)

@_subject: [tor-talk] [Cryptography] Implementing full Internet IPv6 
As readers may be aware,
Tor has an interesting capability via OnionCat and OnionVPN
to join its 80-bits of v2 onion addressing with the IPv6/48
bits provided by the latter tools to yield a self authenticating
128-bit host and internet stack compatible private space.
This brings IPv6 (UDP, ICMP, all its applications, etc) to
the Tor overlay.
Tor breaks that with its v3 onions which are much wider.
As does I2P. And of course CJDNS isn't exctly interop
There's an open project for anyone who wants it...
To bring IPv6 over v3 onions to Tor.
The results of which... that being how to provision roughly
approaching 128-bits of stack compatible reasonably E2E
self or otherwise authenticated space out from any wider
space... would be useful to many of the existing and future
overlay networks out there, to bring instant compatibilty
of those nets with all of users IPv6 apps.
Could be anything from a DHT first seen, to an in network
blockchain registry, to an entirely new modular AF_WIDE
compilation library option which could pluggably open up
a lot of overlay networks to general application usage.
See tor-talk list archives and I2P dev for more
talk on the potential project.

Depends on if and to what extent one needs or wishes to speak
to the clearnet hardware that currently exists...
Yes, one cannot rationally overload all 128 bits for that without colliding
upon allocated IPv6 space that may appear in one's host stack.
However the 1:1 key network can be larger than 64 or 80 bit. One could
easily play with up to say 125 bits by squatting on entirely
unallocated space. (Unlike the clear mistake CJDNS made by
squatting on space already allocated for a specific and conflicting
real world in stack purpose.) Obviously the common library widths
of 96 and 112 could be keyed. And request could be made for a
formal allocation if compatibility and compliance was felt needed
by some mental gymnastics.
Agreed, going from say 64 to 125 bits is not the huge or
universally strong and ideal leap that could be sought for.
And there is the question of secure levels and offloading
(or onboarding as it may be)... at what level would many
users perhaps choose to share their cat pictures...
64, 80, 120, 512? And their finances, affairs, work, email?
Were a slider to exist, where would offloading bulk traffic,
of any given content or purpose, end up being set, and
start to occur? How would you run each as needed?
Do you need a future 8192-bit IPvN in backbone routers
and host stacks to achieve certain strengths and utility
goals? Or can you do it some other way?
For reference...
ORCHIDv2 is also commonly noted...
An IPv6 Prefix for Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers
Version 2 (ORCHIDv2)
   This document specifies an updated Overlay Routable Cryptographic
   Hash Identifiers (ORCHID) format that obsoletes that in RFC 4843.
   These identifiers are intended to be used as endpoint identifiers at
   applications and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and not as
   identifiers for network location at the IP layer, i.e., locators.
   They are designed to appear as application-layer entities and at the
   existing IPv6 APIs, but they should not appear in actual IPv6
   headers.  To make them more like regular IPv6 addresses, they are
   expected to be routable at an overlay level.  Consequently, while
   they are considered non-routable addresses from the IPv6-layer
   perspective, all existing IPv6 applications are expected to be able
   to use them in a manner compatible with current IPv6 addresses.
   The Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers originally
   defined in RFC 4843 lacked a mechanism for cryptographic algorithm
   agility.  The updated ORCHID format specified in this document
   removes this limitation by encoding, in the identifier itself, an
   index to the suite of cryptographic algorithms in use.

As before, yes v3 is a great update, useful for many, even indeed
properly set for users by default. But not for all users, as some may
explicitly choose to trade features of one version, say v3, for long
term capabilities still needed from, or only present for the future
in, another version, say v2.
v3 should be "promoted", yet that shouldn't be at expense
or exclusive to anything else, nor should anything else be
diminishing to it. Modularity works there.
And since v3 is now the default, the low cost work
of "promoting" it is now more or less done.
So perhaps v3 can be set aside on its own for now
to consider what "native" might mean in larger context...
Killing v2, while at the same time not working on porting the
curious IPv6 feature to vN, would be a foot shooting regression
upon the future. While easy way out for some to propose,
it's probably not the right approach.
Maybe yes it's about tool devs and users... about apps...
how to see folks using crypto privacy currency overlays
messaging etc, more or less seamlessly, being protected
from surveillance and censorship and enjoying free speech,
scalable production class networks... do you...
a) Wait forever until some critical number or combination
of overlay networks and new apps, necessarily specifically
exclusively and natively written for those nets alone...
is reached, having mass effect at that point...
b) Try to provide extension API's for your overlay of the
year that works with whatever apps people are already using
today, and provide interop API's between overlays, until some
overlays prove resistant enough for general usage tomorrow.
(Recall that tor still emits an adversary warning on startup
and has entire classes of unsolved weaknesses, as
with any other overlay today.)
Or elements of both and add win from both ends.
Or something else or more.
Historically, most overlays have failed at (a) because
native never widely happened, and because of failing
at (b), along with not yet having sufficient attack resistance,
and plain old tunnel vision competition in narrow and
easier fields (say delivering a message)... perhaps are
missing out on some adoption wins in areas where they
are actually suitable enough.
IPv6 is a potential already "native" area here...
Pick any list of "end user" or "server" applications, generally
any IP capable thing out there that people plug into the internet
(these days most everything is becoming IPv6 capable so let's
just forget about IPv4). Well, the millions of apps out there all
speak IP, and do not speak end to end bidirectional onion or i2p
or anything else, let alone ride on or utilize any auth or uniqueness
expectations therein.
Yes, various LD_PRELOAD and packet filter torifying methods
covers some things as a hack.
However the problem is most apparent with apps that include
addressing info in their data not just use it only for binding
the network stack. Or that use anything other than TCP.
Or that need to route, P2P, DHT, etc. Features break or the app
simply won't work. Bittorrent is one such very popular application,
many more exist, or could exist. Many of which might
need to make use of addressing in data to scale, or UDP
for efficiency or mixing.
Further, trying to plug apps into these overlays is complex and
thereby offputting and risky for all but expert users and admins.
Now if you had some simple range of IPv6 for them to bind
to and filter, or even an AF_WIDE, that becomes a lot easier
to adopt and manage as well.
And of course AF_WIDE, or AF_OVERLAY, though it would
require code in all apps, would be a third party supportable
modular library once plugged in as a compile option to the
thousands of popular apps out there.
Engineer something like that and magic starts to happen.
Or since IPv6, crypto, networks, apps, etc are decades old
now, gather todays knowledge for a try at starting from the
top again.
Perhaps a larger aspect is... everyone in the space should probably
be thinking about these things. Are these tools and overlays
just some ad-hoc complex limited usage highly optimized things
for geeks, activists, particular communities, etc? 100k's of users
or less with very limited interop capabilities.
Or is something larger and more important being built?
500M+'s of users, new RFC's and hardware level everywhere,
universal link level full time crypto and padding, are there even
such things being designed. How to fit a picture with or evolve
todays mainstream app and use models. How to get there?
Where is there? When?
Someone should start a conference, not on what attendee
and projects are doing, but maybe on working to discover
the meta of where much of the space should be heading,
perhaps even together.

As to a different question... being too few and centralized, risks

And yes, the DA's are controlled under threat of arbitrary removal from
the hardcoded list by Tor Project Inc (a US Corporation thus also
under US Govt jurisdiction and control) and its paid employees (both
TPI and its associated payees subject to financial capture by US

still having access to the repo, release, and upgrade mechanisms.
Then more externalities... the community infiltrators and agents, the hosting
companies, the network feeds, the other countries, the mysterious
DoS attacks, black ops, etc. Be influenced, have churn imparted, do what they
want, follow their arbitrary whim, that of their secret Boards, their "Laws",
courts, thugs, etc... or else. DA's have already been arbitrarily shutdown via
weaponized social attacks. Thus one must now always expect that too.
Which many might find absurd. Then look to censorship of freedom of speech,
proposals to ban onions, and other curiosities from around the world.
And must of course expect weaponized legal and extrajudicial attacks
from around the globe. Odds are one or more DA's will fall to such
various means of control before any sort of utopia is reached.
Adversaries are most definitely working to draft the context, even events.
Avoid some of that by distributing away from such centralized control

others are free to further qualify what they introduced.
Cryptocurrency is actually quite green, renewable, clean
and efficient.. it must be in order to compete long term, it is
also naturally incentivized to do so, Fiat has no such care at all.
Media is well known to spew biased FUD and anti about energy,
and they link to non-comparative non-visionary research as the
whole gospel when it's clearly not.
DYOR: Even the crudest of Fermi Estimates, and lowest of
effort searches will start to turn up info therein leading to
searching out a more complete picture...
PoW can take many forms, from mechanical turk captcha brainwork,
to protein folding and other research computing, to serving dual role
as heating etc, yes even to simplistic brute force where needed.
There are many potential PoW choices and libraries out there
and coming in the future. Some hardly "damaging" or rendering
of all land, sea, and civilization to dust.
To just say "PoW bad for Tor" is a bit off, though yes if it
could be a solve, then indeed survey the choices therein.
BTW, you know there are now [PoW] cryptocurrencies and blockchains
that use operate and transport over Tor in various modes... some
exclusively within onions, others split horizon, others well documented
on how to use exits. Same with I2P and other overlay networks.
Is Tor to censor block the "non green" uses?
What about the "illicit" "harmful" uses that are in fact
less volume and incidence than even Fiat sees?
One must also know that Tor nodes and all its infrastructures from
physical to human... consumes many tanker loads of power too.
Yet who has given any open redpill non hypocritical or at least equal
finger pointing thought to analysis on any solar renewable green or
even nextgen nuke sensibility therein?
Where is the Tor relay node selection screen that lets users
select their personal choice to path only through "green" nodes?
How do users even identify and fund those nodes?
Where are the "I run / support green relay" t-shirts for those wishing
to virtue signal?
The onions used to be green, now they're purple,
purple is a strange color in nature, some hesitate on it.
Green pathing would fit right in with the overall "Anti-Sybil relay metadata,
operator WoT, badexit, and DA" research projects, choice and subscription
tool for users that has yet to be explored.
What about Tor declining money from non green, non brutal force,
and even non Proof of Bad Stake... sources and forms? Such as those
from Governments and Banks creating their Fiats for their tax inflation
theft murder war lies ops corruption and manipulation.
Given tor nodes splay across global DC's, biz, and home instead
of some of the more focused, even intentionally green, placement
of cryptocurrency nodes... an actual net analysis of an averaged 1MW
of tor versus 1MW of cryptocurrency, is likely to show Tor as "worse"...
such that betting some cyptocurrency on that would be a win.
Things, ways to create solve and live, all use energy.
Tor uses energy... watts... buildings, cars, food, services, money.
One really needs to start breaking it down to understand it all.
Thankfully cryptocurrency is forcing humanity to break it down,
and to think about and change many of the hardest walls, forces
and energies ever built and expended against them... from physical
to monetary to philosophical to political to mind control and more.
And distributed strong privacy cryptocurrency coins and
privacy networks are helping to make that happen.

European Police Congress: Away with the Darknet
At the European Police Congress in Berlin, a ban on Darknets in free
democratic states was called for.
To start on one's own behalf is supposedly bad style. But this note is
necessary this time: heise online operates since 2016, the hot
tipster, which is accessible, inter alia, via Tor and whistleblowers a
secure contact address in this "Darknet" allows, which was used
several times.
No room for Tor
If the current federal government decides, then this may be a criminal
offense in the future. At the opening of the 22nd European Police
Congress in Berlin, Günter Krings, Parliamentary State Secretary in
the Federal Ministry of the Interior, demanded a radical ban on Tor:
"I understand why the Darknet can be of use in autocratic systems, but
in a free, open democracy, I think for no legitimate benefits, those
who use the Darknet are usually up to no good, and this simple
realization should also be reflected in our legal system. "
The needs of whistleblowers have no place in the world view of Krings,
which demanded a second IT security law, which should be implemented
later this year. In the remainder of his speech, the CDU politician
was primarily concerned with the SPD-led Ministry of Justice, which in
his view, the propagated pact for the rule of law systematically
undermines and delays. It would have long been possible to settle the
question of what should happen to German jihad fighters who want to
get rid of Kurds and Syrians, said the State Secretary. However,
Krings praised the tool RADAR-iTE, which reliably identifies and
classifies Islamists on a three-level scale.
Krings was followed in the opening ceremony by Wolfgang Sobotka,
President of the Austrian National Council. He praised China for not
having any inhibitions and successfully ignoring data protection when
analyzing citizens. His statement that there is a human right to
political asylum, but no human right to asylum for economic or social
reasons, fit into the picture he drew.

Tor is effected by lack of external thought.
Your adversaries are assuredly looking at those things and more.
If you are not looking at them, you're done in mate.
That's apologist talk to avoid clean slate researching
and creating better architectures, even to the
then at that point possibly legit point of being
able to actually make that declaration.
Tor is and will always be 20 year old architecture
from time before current adversary models were
say matured if not known. Tor's relatively
simple and effectively static with only marginal
improvements left. And has outright traded off
and/or discarded design models that others
might not today.  (And obviously Tor arch cannot
be substantially changed while still calling itself Tor.)
Before declaring Tor sufficient against today threats
you need to analyse it against today threats
vs new networks being research and deploy
against today threats.
Those concerned with messengers vs
messages are prone to miss some dead canaries.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Anti-Sybil (re: Explain... all the Nodes) 
As said before, the category of Anti Sybil Web of Trust Projects
needs considered, and could even cover such speculative subjects.
It's not about analysing the meta of one node or one operator,
even if a true positive hit, in general the yield is approximately
zero percent of any overlay network's nodes, it's about stepping
back and agnostically analysing them all.
Go investigate and collate all the possible meta informations...
Node location, payment, OS, ISP, uptimes, anon / nym / PGP / GovID,
workplace, politic, blogs, whatever else you can imagine,
including incorporating what's already in the consensus, contact,
MyFamily, nickname, both real world and virtual infos,
operator to operator p2p Web of Trust...
No node has to supply any infos.
Put it all in a db and give users tools to select node sets.
Some users might select State's, or State's workers or
even Statist's nodes, over say anon nodes, as maybe they
feel they have to play by some "rules" that anon nodes don't.
Others might reject operators that post stupid pics on Facebook.
Or all Ubuntu relays. Or nodes that engage in free speech
they don't like, some in Tor Project would love that selector, lol.
It doesn't matter, it's a meta project, with it you can accept or
reject on whatever whim you wish by node fingerprints in your client.
And if the Sybil WoT project ends up discovering some interesting
potential threats classes among the entire node set, you win.
Until then, you are potentially missing all of that, and are not
raising Sybil's costs of doing business by forcing them to
expend much resource into playing real world Web of Trust
against users who might select to use various positive-meta-ranking
and or WoT structures. Right now Sybil's cost is only a little hosting.
If not, you can still report bad exits and other actual technical
node and traffic mangling to tor-relays and or bad-relays,
at least until someone DHT's or otherwise distributes tor
away from the more centralized DA design.
Note that Tor's architecture does not protect much against
Global Passive Adversary of NSA style fiber Vampires,
that threat does not require Sybil nodes, nor do they
have to be Global or Govt, even Tier-N backbones can
tap, analyse, and do nefarious things like and with that,
including sell, give, and partner it all away.
Though they can and do run Sybil nodes to help inject,
manipulate, block, see, etc traffic, nodes, and clients.
On flip perspective, maybe you really don't want to develop
WoT's and such, simply because enabling creeping featureism
of it all can lead to exclusivity and control whereby valuable anon
diversity is selected away from and purged. That would be very bad.
Either way, other than the usual design, protocol, code, and "Lawfare"
exploit space, and the coming Quantum Compute adversary, Sybil and Vampire
are likely todays biggest remaining threats to overlay networks.
None of todays networks seem to be trying to do anything to stop
Sybil, and only a few networks put Vampire as any sort of priority [1].
While Vampire may perhaps be solved with some technical measures,
Sybil may require some sort sort of human based measures.
[1] Curiously, cryptocurrencies do employ Anti-Sybil in various
proofs of work (adversary cost raising), and can help defund Vampires.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Anti-Sybil (re: Explain... all the Nodes) 
Its mentioned modularity is a nice feature wherein
here any number of module author groups could collate
data in their areas of interest / knowledge into modules
that then get plugged into the node selection framework.
Usually on the lists people often seek to
avoid or stay with certain countries, so that
leads to a "jurisdiction / MLAT" module.
There could be "seabed fiber owner operator" module.
A human-to-human operator WoT module.
Many more you can think up.
Tor currently offers perhaps only three, they are
in essence the default modules...
- random selection and exit policy
- bandwidth / consensus weights
- DA decisions
Keep the defaults, or go with community assemblings,
or choose whichever modules you want and any
specific configuration each provides, add them
into the node selection engine under any relative
weighting you choose, point the engine at the controller,
or otherwise load it into the overlay daemon.
It would not be difficult to conceive how such
framework could be extended for use with
many of the node based overlay networks.
Is it wise to override the defaults of any such network?
Perhaps until there are networks strongly or completely
resistant to Sybil, Vampires, and any other classes of
attacks... there may be cases and conditions where it is,
and many where it isn't... one size might not fit all.
There would probably be some interest out there in
developing a list of all potential modules. And even coding and
datafeeding the more popular ones, say the "Human WoT",
as a proof of concept exploration.
Note Bittorrent "Here's a bunch of random nodes, good luck"...
for which many communities collate and maintain published lists
of known or suspect nodes to block (MAFIAA networks, LEA, etc)
by plugging them into clients, resolvers, and packet filters, in an
effort to reduce risk of Sybil beyond the defaults.

It's possible to augment such outbound
solution offerings even further by running
an OpenVPN termination service so users
can transport UDP between clearnet as well.
VPNGate.net project has an idea there too.
Even large regional IPv6 pools could be bought
and shared by operators and rotated through.
More tor relay operators should consider
some of the above options, whether as a
requested "bridge" service mechanism, or
listed in the consensus "contact" field, or
as more of a standalone VPNGate support,
or "ExitGate" project sort of arrangement.
Using only tor right now, a user needs to use a clearnet service
that does not scrape consensus, or one not fronted by services
doing similar to CloudFlare's spiteful default tor blocking policy,
or find a lucky exit within whatever geolocation game the clearnet
service uses, or get lucky through traditional vpn or proxy.
But those are only fun statistical hacks, not real long term solutions
to the underlying problem.
It's unfortunate that such braindead blocking, stupid policy regimes,
sites refusal to developing creative solutions [1] for so many world's
users legitimate privacy, info risk, anonymity needs... often results
in users accounts being locked out and escalated into forcing disclosure
of users private info and ID to sites to unlock them, thus exposing
users to ongoing long term fraud, cost, and stress when that info
(in most cases truly unnecessary to collect) is eventually shared
misused and stolen by both sites and criminals... or outright auto
deletion of user's valued account, built up social networks, etc...
all for doing nothing wrong, and harming no one or thing.
Death by DriveByExit :(
And really shameful to deny world's users the right to simply read
a website, be it social, commercial, information, etc or even sadly
their own tax-theft funded governmental public sites doing this
blocking too.
There are some related projects, best practice, as well...
Positive outreach and direct engagement by Tor community
is key here, and perhaps not enough of that is happening,
at least not publicly. It's a big enough issue that it really needs
a dedicated, active, allied, and even funded subproject...
a MegaProject that needs to happen.

deposits refundable in time, increasing account priviledges
and features based on account age and activity, community

third party tracking-free local SecurImage style captcha throughout

Exit country restriction still subject to weighting

Users can search and MAPADDRESS to an exit,

So tor needs MAPADDRESS function to handle across
multiple specified exits, in order to maintain tor's
auto hopping around exits every so often.
Tor doesn't make it easy for users to manage their exits.
Tor doesn't know best for all.
There are no configurable parameters to make general

For most services there is some workaround.
And chances are if there isn't, the services often suck
so bad as to be of no interest to many population
CDN's aren't free, VEVO etc are surely paying nice sums
to have their junk hosted on YouTube.
Models are beginning out there where you can actually
host your own for free...
When encrypted anon p2p overlay networks and meshnets exist,
combined with decentralized distributed content browsing
applications, and privacy cryptocurrencies for monetizing your own,
all the garbage services like YouTube and Facebook disappear.
Only thing you have to pay on for is your internet connection.
Even that is free if you built your own meshnet guerrilla net.
Look at DTube for an early and incomplete example.
Tools are still handy... encrypt, hop, obfuscate all the things.
Given the choice most people would not do that.
They did not fight, so they have no choice or negotiation.
Useful if the account is worth the $ to people,
but that option is going away fast, because
people are not fighting enough to keep it.
Many many countries require privacy invading ID to buy a SIM,
invasive shipping ID to get SIM shipped cross border,
and invasive passport ID to travel to countries that don't.
Much better if Google YouTube and all other online services
accepted privacy cryptocurrencies, a roughly SIM cost amount,
as forfeitable deposit on account behaviour. Or even a plain
old deposit / payment mailed in via the post. Or deployed
various community and algorithm methods.
But they don't, because behaviour isn't the issue,
their goal is to enslave you, for which making behaviour
enforcing as growing accepted norm is but one way.
Nor how easily their phone # can be SimJacking attacked
and SDR Stingray OpenBTS intercepted.
Nothing really wrong with privacy preserving TOTP RFC 6238

But no, they want the phone # to datamine crosslink your ass,
while lievertising you that phone # is secure, private, etc.
So many examples in news of what these GovCorp

Last N digits of many ID systems are enough to correlate

cameras linked to doorway IMEI recorders, to receipts,

When opponents have all the data, tech, "laws", and control,
hiding is not a win, it is not a fight, it is a decreasingly effective
temporary feelgood substitute for fighting the policy itself.
Did you read the latest news on USA DNA Biometric Facial
mandatory databases creation and abuse, inside country,

secret backend vendors databases.
Amazon Ring secret partnering with "law" enforcement.
Mailing shipping services new ID and size policies.
Social credit scores in your own country.
0-days against your systems sold off to the highest Gov bidder.
On and on the list goes, the chains closing around everyones

Yet tools are nothing without instructions.

10:17 AM - 29 Nov 2019
USA Berman: As alleged, Virgil Griffith provided highly technical
information to North Korea, knowing that this information could be
used to help North Korea launder money and evade sanctions.
"GRIFFITH was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport yesterday
and will be presented in federal court in Los Angeles later today.
U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman stated: "As alleged, Virgil Griffith
provided highly technical information to North Korea, knowing that
this information could be used to help North Korea launder money and
evade sanctions. In allegedly doing so, Griffith jeopardized the
sanctions that both Congress and the president have enacted to place
maximum pressure on North Korea's dangerous regime." Assistant
Attorney General John Demers said: "Despite receiving warnings not to
go, Griffith allegedly traveled to one of the United States' foremost
adversaries, North Korea, where he taught his audience how to use
blockchain technology to evade sanctions. By this complaint, we begin
the process of seeking justice for such conduct."

Generally speaking...
There's more big picture for tor, for all overlays...
than just as tools to surf the web, lots more
you can plug into them than just a downloader,
much more to discover than on the surface TV.
And with cryptocurrencies being overlay networks
themselves, some now riding over I2P / Tor / Etc,
and or developing privacy protocols themselves,
there is certainly some tech that can be shared
and developed and interfaces made between them.
Be one step ahead.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Onioncat and Tor Hidden Services V3 
Rather than tor killing off v2 onions and HSDirs from the
codebase, thus ending all the good useful carefully chosen
and even required reasons people still use v2 and onioncat
(some of which can be found by searching list archives
for onioncat, P2P, VoIP, add more uses here)...
tor could update the default to create v3 onions,
and to require manual config of v2 onions, and to emit
nanny warnings pointing to a v2 vs v3 comparison table
on the wiki, update v2 to be as small a diff as possible
from v3, modularize v2 support and HSDir operations.
That way v2 and v3 users remain happy.
It also seems possible that a solution to what
onioncat provides via v2 onions (IPv6, UDP, IP transport
services in the host stack out across onionland, some
crazy routes between I2P, metrics ping, etc) could be
designed for v3 onions. Perhaps some form of time
expired or first come served 1:1 registration to HSDir hashring
for lookups, a NameCoin like sidechain, or using one of the
existing Tor / I2P native addressing enabled privacy cryptocurrency
blockchains as lookup index, or some new and open network
overlay DHT layer for everyone, or AF_WIDE, IPFS or
other hash based storage network, etc.
Even some tradeoffs in a solution to achieve a v3 onioncat
might be acceptable... in the same way that some v2 "security risk"
issues are accepted today by those needing what onioncat offers
thus overriding that, or are not relavant because their application
use model is not affected by such risk.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Onioncat and Tor Hidden Services V3 
Right. P2P type of applications start to break down
when the host / user count grows beyond the
10 or so that even private user groups are able
to maintain by hand. For user apps and protocols
that need it, currently v3 breaks the cool automatic
1:1 plug and play scalability that v2 offers.
It would need a specific example.
But in general, that class of "problem" is really a user
configuration and usage problem... ie: use a sandbox.
DNS key-value[s] data fields for onioncat/48 could be handled
within the network overlay itself over the ocat IPv6 interface for UDP,
or over v2 / v3 onion in TCP mode, etc.
The real problem with DNS as data fields for onioncat / tor / i2p / cjdns / etc
is that DNS is a centralized hierarchy... see: SOA. So users or
the entire overlay network using it can and will get lookups
censored, remapped, played, shutdown, etc by DNS operators,
sybils, agents, exploits, and failures in the overlay network.
NameCoin and all sorts of other fully distributed protocols
for hacking a key-value[s] lookup do exist. They could easily
be plugged into onioncat and or tor and run within the network
overlay itself.
However yes, if HSdirs can be used, that seems better,
lightweight, simple, and mostly already exists.
Maybe try expanding this into a post with picture sketches
on the blog. That way people can see how it would operate
and what parts are needed.

Voice and video conferencing apps can and do
work over I2P, Tor, Phantom, etc.
Use the lowest quality, bandwidth, window size,
frame rate, etc settings possible.
UDP and IPv6 can and do work over all three of the above networks.
With .onion (.i2p) use OnionCat (GarliCat) to enable UDP and IPv6.
Search this list for all the cool things you can do with OnionCat.
Get it here...
Tor exits still don't offer any IP VPN termination services
to tor circuits. So for UDP over tor exit, use your own or
a third party VPN, shell, proxychain etc that offers UDP.

It's entirely possible to have some comms peers on clearnet
in same chatscreen panel mashup at the same time with peers
on onioncat/48, i2p.etc. It all depends on the routing horizons,
and or hub selections, users setup and maintain in such conferences.
Whonix is quite reasonable interesting isolation idea over Tails.
Be sure to evaluate the two in own usage models.
Imagine an overlay network that offered VPN termination
services to clearnet from the overlay... even cryptocurrency
supported ones, such as cryptocurrency data storage networks
do today... the models exist, explore them.
Note also, Zcash style zero-knowledge is still quite equally
valid to this day, among other competing privacy crypto models
such as Monero. Explore the entirety of onchain privacy,
it is evolving nicely, early days.
Not against State Associated Agents, such as say LE conjoined with
Top Secret entities Parallel Constructing, or other generic Sybil trolls,
perhaps, as in the subject Snowden and other slides and public docs,
this hardly in fact true, tor being no exception, witness myriad published
tor network exploits, same as any other current overlay network.
Against random wannabe's, such as say an employer, or some
website, sure, reasonably well. Those two, and others, are still a
good thing, accomplished by any fairly rudimentary overlay measures.
That covers many users, but not all those rightfully, justly,
and naturally, freedom and privacy oriented.
Also, Tor Project Inc snowflakes are censoring this post by
forcing it to go to mandatory "moderation" first, while others are
free to post entirely unmoderated, including, shamefully, said self
appointed TPIs. Think of the ramifications before you accept
such censorship regimes in your life.
Move to distributed messaging, social, and multimedia to ensure
your freedom of speech and consumption against such censors
like TPO, Youtube, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, etc... ASAP!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Speculated Broken by FBI Etc - Freedom Hosting, 
Given the variety of known weaknesses, exploits, categories
of papers, and increasing research efforts against tor and
overlay networks in general, and the large number of these
"mystery gaps" type of articles (some court cases leaving hardly
any other conclusion with fishy case secrecy, dismissals, etc)...
the area of speculative brokeness and parallel construction
seems to deserve serious investigative fact finding project of
global case collation, interview, analysis to better characterize.
Feb 8, 2020
A dark web tycoon pleads guilty. But how was he caught?
The FBI found Eric Marques by breaking the famed anonymity service
Tor, and officials won’t reveal if a vulnerability was used. That has
activists and lawyers concerned.
When the enterprising cybercriminal Eric Eoin Marques pleaded guilty
in an American court this week, it was meant to bring closure to a
seven-year-long international legal struggle centered on his dark web
In the end, it did anything but.
Marques faces up to 30 years in jail for running Freedom Hosting,
which temporarily existed beyond reach of the law and ended up being
used to host drug markets, money-laundering operations, hacking
groups, and millions of images of child abuse. But there is still one
question that police have yet to answer: How exactly were they able to
catch him? Investigators were somehow able to break the layers of
anonymity that Marques had constructed, leading them to locate a
crucial server in France. This discovery eventually led them to
Marques himself, who was arrested in Ireland in 2013.
Marques was the first in a line of famous cybercriminals to be caught
despite believing that using the privacy-shielding anonymity network
Tor would make them safe behind their keyboards. The case demonstrates
that government agencies can trace suspects through networks that were
designed to be impenetrable.
Marques has blamed the American NSA’s world-class hackers, but the FBI
has also been building up its efforts since 2002. And, some observers
say, they often withhold key details of their investigations from
defendants and judges alike—secrecy that could have wide-ranging
cybersecurity implications across the internet.
“The overarching question is when are criminal defendants entitled to
information about how law enforcement located them?” asks Mark Rumold,
a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an
organization that promotes online civil liberties. “It does a
disservice to our criminal justice system when the government hides
techniques of investigation from public and criminal defendants.
Oftentimes the reason they do this kind of obscuring is because the
technique they use is questionable legally or might raise questions in
the public’s mind about why they were doing it. While it’s common for
them to do this, I don’t think it benefits anyone.”
Freedom Hosting was an anonymous and illicit cloud computing company
running what some estimated to be up to half of all dark web sites in
2013. The operation existed entirely on the anonymity network Tor and
was used for a wide range of illegal activity, including the hacking
and fraud forum HackBB and money-laundering operations including the
Onion Bank. It also maintained servers for the legal email service Tor
Mail and the singularly strange encyclopedia Hidden Wiki.
But it was the hosting of sites used for photos and videos of child
exploitation that attracted the most hostile government attention.
When Marques was arrested in 2013, the FBI called him the “largest
facilitator” of such images “on the planet.”
Early on August 2 or 3, 2013, some of the users noticed “unknown
Javascript” hidden in websites running on Freedom Hosting. Hours
later, as panicked chatter about the new code began to spread, the
sites all went down simultaneously. The code had attacked a Firefox
vulnerability that could target and unmask Tor users—even those using
it for legal purposes such as visiting Tor Mail—if they failed to
update their software fast enough.
While in control of Freedom Hosting, the agency then used malware that
probably touched thousands of computers. The ACLU criticized the FBI
for indiscriminately using the code like a “grenade.”
The FBI had found a way to break Tor’s anonymity protections, but the
technical details of how it happened remain a mystery.
“Perhaps the greatest overarching question related to the
investigation of this case is how the government was able to pierce
Tor’s veil of anonymity and locate the IP address of the server in
France,” Marques’s defense lawyers wrote in a recent filing.
In the original indictment, there is little information beyond
references to an “investigation in 2013” that found a key IP address
linked to Freedom Hosting (referred to in the document as the “AHS,”
or anonymous hosting service).
Marques’s defense lawyers said they received only “vague details” from
the government, and that “this disclosure was delayed, in part,
because the investigative techniques employed were, until recently,
Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesperson, said the letter is “not
in the public record.” The defense attorneys did not respond to
Related story
The NSA found a dangerous flaw in Windows and told Microsoft to fix it
The secretive security agency identified the vulnerability and is
taking public credit as part of an effort to “build trust.”
Not-so-full disclosure
US government agencies regularly find software vulnerabilities in the
course of their security work. Sometimes these are disclosed to
technology vendors, while at other times the government decides to
keep these exploits for use as weapons or in investigations. There is
a formal system for deciding whether an issue should be shared, known
as the Vulnerabilities Equities Process. This is meant to default
toward disclosure, under the belief that any bug that affects the “bad
guys” also has the potential to be used against American interests; an
agency that wants to use a major bug in an investigation has to get
approval, or else the bug will be publicly disclosed. US officials say
the vast majority of such vulnerabilities end up disclosed so that
they can be fixed, ideally increasing internet security for everyone.
But if the FBI used a software vulnerability to find Freedom Hosting’s
hidden servers and didn’t disclose the details, it could still
potentially use it against others on Tor. This has observers
“It’s not uncommon to play these games where they hide the ball about
the source of their information,” the EFF’s Rumold says.
Tor is free software designed to let anyone use the internet
anonymously by encrypting traffic and bouncing it through various
nodes to obfuscate connections to the original users. Users could
include Americans sick of being tracked by advertising companies,
Iranians attempting to circumvent censorship, Chinese dissidents
escaping national surveillance, or criminals like Marques attempting
to stay ahead of international police. The users are diverse in every
way, but software vulnerabilities can affect all of them.
In a 2017 criminal case, the US government put the secrecy of its
hacking tools above all else. Prosecutors chose to drop all charges in
a case of child exploitation on the dark web rather than reveal the
technological means they used to locate the anonymized Tor user.
Freedom Hosting’s closure was the first in a series of stunning
successes by international law enforcement that shut down some of the
most high-profile criminal websites in history.
Two months after Marques was caught, the free-wheeling marketplace
Silk Road was shut down in another FBI-led operation. After
facilitating at least hundreds of millions of dollars in sales, Silk
Road became a symbol of the apparent invulnerability of the criminals
inhabiting the dark web. Although it lasted  less than three years, it
was clear that Silk Road’s founder, nicknamed Dread Pirate Roberts,
felt invincible. Close to the end, the anonymous figure was giving
interviews to magazines like Forbes and writing political essays about
his cause and the ideology behind it.
Then, in October 2013, Ross Ulbricht—a 29-year-old online
bookseller—was arrested in San Francisco and charged with running Silk
Road. He was eventually sentenced to life in prison, a punishment that
far exceeds whatever Marques might receive at his sentencing date in
Freedom Hosting and Silk Road were just the most well-known dark web
sites that were brought down by law enforcement despite the anonymity
that Tor is meant to provide.
“We can’t have a world where a government is allowed to use a black
box of technology from which spring these serious criminal
prosecutions,” Rumold says. “Defendants have to have the ability to
test and review and look at the methods that are used in criminal

Given an overlay network offering certain degrees of
say security / bandwidth / latency can be comparatively
inverse degree to clearnet...
Depending what is sought, that can be of limited help. See
traffic analysis of gravity wells, the voids and densities between.
Nor are people validating "people", so Sybil abounds.
Manual central / "decentral" manipulation, over unknowns,
by unknowns, can be of of limited trust... compare to
distributed random chance.
If an overlay wants to steer diversity there, its community
should be working ports to other non-Linux OS kernels,
and informing selection for that via notes in highly user
visible places about it.
There was a BSD group that grew and reported success
some years ago. It is a great platform that could easily
be ramped up.
Users don't see them, so they have no oppurtunity to consider
trust them over say distributed design that transforms
most central management into selectable subscriptions model
users can choose from and contribute to. A lot of potential
models there aren't really explored by projects due to central
being default think, easier, cheaper, faster, and distributed
often being roughly equivalent in similar areas.
Physical control of machines and traffic data.
Overlay communities must effort to shop for hosts if they want
to diversify that, and run nodes at home where comfortable.
And beware of Tier-1 default path rollup. Interesting approach
would be overlays deploying peering path aware modular router
into nodes, integration of radio and physical mesh networks, etc.
Global telecoms are not your friends. At least not hardly until
they start encrypting their links, publicly fighting "requests"
and lobbying vocally for you.
Better off to start building physical p2p networks around them.
Same idea as cryptocurrency.
Yes things like this are not only handy and interesting
good work and research areas, but offer food for thought
to the entire network overlay space as it pursues whatever
current work and future designs may come.
Hopefully all projects in the space can contribute their own
research and find and take each others into consideration
where useful.
Not a new problem, been analysed by the space since years.
Not necessarily. OP generally alluded to selection gravity wells
and the way that relates to trust, adversary, analysis aspects.
More nodes of particular bandwidth could flatten distribution
and performance, while affecting network analysis properties
in some not so good ways.
Simply adding more bandwidth and or relays under the
current design and operation will not much change those
elements and interactions.
Weighting for "busy nodes good" also a bit of assumptive
dance bet around *PA traffic analysis and Sybil problems.
It's fine to chase diminishing returns there if desired.
Yet also perhaps time for at least a good portion of the researchers
and projects in overlay space to form and renew efforts around both
dormant old and novel new work towards attacking those
two problems directly in new design and operation models.

A good contract against logging, retaining, sharing,
that is actually upheld, can be quite valuable.
The problem comes in verifying the implementation
of those statements, and in divining when any upholding
will be thrown out the window for higher priorities.
VPN chains provide the same fundamental as tor does...
circuit based, tunneled, client-to-exit crypto.
In fact, people were chaining things around the net well
before both tor and rise of vpn services. Tor just made it
easy by wrapping a management engine over a bunch of
nodes. With enhancements coming from also being the
node software itself.
VPNgate makes things easy too. With a new influx of help
from various communities, vpngate could be greatly expanded...
dynamic tunnel pathing, more nodes, even hosted along with
tor, i2p, etc, paid with crypto. Added bonus of UDP and binding
inbound, providing termination from other networks.
Things begin to get interesting at that point as another choice
that has fairly well known properties.
Like tor, surely not a next generation design, but an alternative.
It's opensource, so it can get to native Linux and BSD before long.
Might even be able to run it in droid emulator and push traffic through
it that way.
There's a lot of crazy things coming from blockchain land :)
Can you or anyone link to papers that make a general proof of that?
ie: Not to papers that merely present weaknesses in some specific
proposed approach to date, but to something that proves "doing that"
is not possible. Proof of negative can steer work in other areas.
Safely... against traffic analysis bugaboo.
Stream... generally, not a single packet, but two or more generated
under and belonging to some user app context in a line.
While likely not impossible to carve up a transfer,
spray it across some magic random routing cloud,
and reassemble it on the other side in as near as real time as
some torrent sequence reassembly buffer mechanism will allow...
definitely not going to be happily "stream" it like YouTube
unless cloud has zero packet loss, which it won't,
leading to segment re-quest or falls back to store-forward.
Whether "stream" or "message" or otherwise, a mix still
needs to generate fill so that *PA's cannot simply match
up two endpoint usage patterns.
Given a fill that can defeat that, then ride such happy
stream circuits on top within and part of it as needed
up to your bandwidth commitment.
What percent of relays, relative to both node and operator counts,
pay by the Byte actually transferred, vs for an unmetered bitrate contract?
Same question for end user client non-relay nodes?
Answers even potentially gathered from among all the overlay networks.
Any actual studies there?
declare that no relay family should get more than 10% of the total
consensus weight for any relay role (guard, exit, etc). By adopting a
policy like that, we could accidentally *increase* the total weight that
actual bad relays receive, thus providing yet another incentive for
attackers to assign their families incorrectly.
See also the tickets on whether MyFamily is a harmful idea, because
it pulls traffic away from honest relay operators and sends it to
dishonest ones:
So in summary: (a) yes we should get more relays and more capacity, and
(b) yes it is super important for us to get better at making the consensus
weights accurate and predictable and well-understood, but also (c) there
are a bunch of interconnected reasons why these two steps are important
It may help to try adding each proposed type of change, each
ranked by potential impact, into bins label *PA traffic analysis,
performance, jurisdictional and other diversity, sybil, etc to
analyze what they do to the bins by their weight in each.
Though, hm. In the sense that Tor's security comes down to probabilities,
it's not obvious that 20% of the network is much worse than 10% of the
network. ...
The actual probabilities depend on the specific attack we're talking about
Those of us with years experience in bad relay area,
and of course other fields in general, each have our own
estimated percentage and odds ranges therein, and how
they've changed over time.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How secure is a hidden service? 
Time and traffic are elements of some known research exploits.
One form of general answer might also be...
Given the number of proven research exploits against such
services in the public literature, and the presumed attention
to high security that at least some of the fallen services
must have given, it's probably worth assuming that...
- Public research exploits are being used in the wild.
- Private research exploits do exist and are being used in the wild.
- Adversaries using such public exploits, and most assuredly
such private ones, are unwilling to let those respective facts
of advantage become known, particularly when parallel construction
and various [il]legal processes around the world effectively allow
those trump cards to remain secret, thus not triggering defensive
moves and arms races to their disadvantage.
This isn't specific to tor, it's the nature of the entire netsec game,
the history of such games showing that many such preposterous
ideas not always as far fetched as their prior critiques presumed.
While searching the web for the exploit papers is easy, the
difficulty comes in showing the actual usage of any exploit.
There's probably a wide range of honorary awards and nice paychecks
available to whoever breaks any big news or research regarding the topic.
And certainly many thanks from rights workers, journalists, etc
whose very lives and work depend on it.
