@_subject: [tor-talk] Default clients to be non-exit relay 
There're few problems with ISP when running non-exit relay. Users in
moderately censored areas can act as non-exit relay without causing problem
to the circuit. So why doesn't Tor default to non-exit relay?  Users with
problems(e.g crappy hardware, ISP fireware) can manually change it to
client only to improve performance/trouble shooting.

This will make blocking tor nearly impossible and eliminate the need for
Bridge node since authority will have a hard time keeping up with all
non-exit node dynamical.
As for the hostile geographic areas, because the large amount of nodes and
tor only serve 1k of them, the possibility is very small. Also, from our
experience of censorship in China(We're the founders of
 the police will not care if you're using
circumventions or help other circumvent in small scale.
Pushing two versions are confusing for the users. However, the Tor could
detect the current IP and use Geo-location to determine not to act as a
non-exit node in some black-listed country.China is not one of them. And
I'll be surprised if there're more than 3 countries that will physically
harass Tor users instead of find technical ways(e.g traffic fingerprint) to
disrupt connection. I believe China will be forced to analyze encrypted
traffic in real time to stop such a move.

This is the response I'm trying to address.
"Requiring every Tor user..."
Enforcing the relay will indeed cause trouble but default it will have much
less negative effect much almost all benefit.
" However, many Tor users cannot be good relays ? for example, some Tor
clients operate from behind restrictive firewalls, connect via modem, or
otherwise aren't in a position where they can relay traffic. "
Exit-relay will have serious trouble in those situations. However, most
firewalls don't restrict non-exit relay.

Griffin pointed out Tor could download only a portion of relays.
Now when I manually choose serve as a relay, Tor automatically determines
my bandwidth option(>1.5M).  Tor can default to relay for large bandwidth
users only. To implement it gradually, you can even do it country by
country and observe the gradual change and modify accordingly.
Lastly, a bit off topic
I'm often shocked why anyone didn't  come up with some specific thought on
some classic problems puzzling human over centuries in the field of math
and physics. The thing is, they just didn't and I did c

VPNGate is better at internet circumvention than Tor because Tor has been
thoroughly and automatically  blocked in China. But VPN protocol cannot be
blocked as many commercial companies rely on it

What about Tor obfuscated bridges?
Tor has published a blog post on normal bridges automatically probed by
Some say that obfuscated bridges are also probed.
It will work. But users in China want to avoid censorship rather than
remain anonymous. VPN or any circumvention method is already slow enough in
China. Adding tor is useless for almost all users in China
