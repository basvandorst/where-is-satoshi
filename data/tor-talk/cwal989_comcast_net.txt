@_subject: [tor-talk] A secure browsing model? 
I am not new to TOR, but it has been a while since I used it, and it appears
from reading the few posts I've received so far, that it has changed
considerably since I last used it.
While I am knowledgeable about computers, the Internet (though not with some of
the newer stuff), and programming, I am not familiar with VPN services - I have
heard of them, but have not researched them.  By VMs I assume you mean virtual
machines, I have some experience in getting frustrated trying to set them up. ;)
Can anyone point me to some resources that will help to fill me in on the
changes, and on how to maximize security (anonymity), I would be grateful.
One thing I really liked about TOR, when I was using it was that the Internet
trackers couldn't trace me and bombard me with ads based on the sites I visited
(unless I opted in).

@_subject: [tor-talk] A secure browsing model? 
I've looked at your site and I have a question.  I know I could probably find
the answer by fully reading the documentation on your site and on the Tor site,
but I just got up and don't feel like reading through reams of information to
get a simple answer.
Is the TorBrowser and actual web browser or is it a set of patches and
configuration requirements to use Firefox in a secure way with Tor?
I discovered, first hand, the difficulty of truly anonymizing Firefox and all
its kin when I used Tor before.  I'd rather use a browser that is specifically
built for security and anonymity than use a browser that was never made to
protect your privacy, if possible.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hi all! 
Hi, I am not new to Tor, though it has been a while since I've used it.  I
notice that there are many changes since I used it last.  I have some some
questions to get me up to speed with the newest release.
I hope you don't mind my asking these questions, since my attention span is
about that of a gnat since I have an extreme toothache.  Otherwise I would
probably read all the docs.
1. Is there a preferred browser and OS to maximize security?
2. What is the best way to use a VPN with Tor to increase anonymity?
3. Is there now a way to use Tor to send anonymous email?  (All but government
controlled remailers were shut down).
I can use Windows 7 64 bit + any GNU/Linux or Posix OS that supports multibit
I'd like to get back into using Tor (I stopped because the TorButton was ...
unreliable for anonymity).
Any recommended reading, if not direct answers?  Think of me as a newbie who's
not really a newbie - that is, I've used Tor and just want to be brought up to
speed on the most secure way to use the new version.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor plus VPN (was re: Hi all!) 
Actually, I know little about VPN.  I was asking, in the hope that I could
learn more - and also it was suggested (I'm not sure where) that using a VPN
with Tor was better than either alone.  Maybe it would help if someone
explained VPN - its good and bad points.
So the replies I've received are what I was looking for, mostly.  I just want
to be anonymous when browsing the web - if Tor alone can accomplish that, I
will be satisfied.  Too many companies track everything you do on the Internet
(including ISPs), then sell that information.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor plus VPN (was re: Hi all!) 
Thank you for your reply.
I understand the security assumptions that Tor is based upon, and believe them
to be more sound than using proxy servers (even with nesting).  As for the
implementation, I am a programmer, and Tor is open source so I COULD look at
the implementation by downloading the source code and going through it (a very
time consuming process).
So, in essence VPNs in this context, are just another form of proxy server (or
another way to access one).  I agree, there is no way to even know if you are
anonymous - after all, I am sure that some VPNs are run by governments (not
that they'd tell you that).
Doesn't everything come down to trust, in the end?  Everything going through
the Internet is logged, and unless encrypted, world-readable.  Often, it is
logged, even then in unencrypted form, on the other side.
What I get from this discussion is that, with anything that makes you
anonymous, you can't be sure of the level (I couldn't even if I did go through
the Tor source code, since I have no way of knowing if every Tor node my
traffic passes through is using *that* source code).  It is a matter of trust,
best practices, and the integrity of the system you're using.
I will probably check them out.

@_subject: [tor-talk] NSA supercomputer 
Wouldn't this question be more appropriate for a crypto specific
mailing list?  Of course you may find that crypto experts may not be
experts on TOR, though they can give you an idea of how long it would
take to brute force an encrypted stream or file, given what resources,
etc.  As for the NSA, they closely guard how many supercomputers they have
and how many they use for decryption.  However, if you are on their
list (the NSA or any government entity), it does not matter how strong
the cryptography is, you can and will be brought in and "convinced" to
divulge anything and everything they want to know.

I don't like getting into discussions about what intelligence agencies
can and cannot do, especially since I am not an expert on Internet
However, I will say that what the NSA can and cannot do is likely a
closely guarded secret, and when they complete that mega data storage
complex in Utah, later this year, they will have the capability to
store all Internet activity for many years.  That is all I am willing to say.

@_subject: [tor-talk] [cryptography] The Heartbleed Bug is a serious 
It seems no one wants to talk or hear about this issue.  It is not being reported on media sites or anywhere else, other than the Heartbleed site, and the OpenSSL lists.
This bug has been a known issue for about 2 years, and we are only now learning about it.  Not from banking, credit card, or shopping sites, nor from most news sites (the reports I've seen on news sites tend to downplay the scope and severity of the problem altogether, or simply say, "It's fixed").  Saying "it's fixed", is far from true.
It makes me wonder if the NSA was involved in inserting this bug into OpenSSL clients and servers.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Heartbleed and TOR 
Since I am neither an expert on OpenSSL nor TOR, let's get one question out of the way before anything further is said on the topic:  Does TOR actually use potentially vulnerable versions of OpenSSL (or use it at all, for that matter)?
If so, then it *could* pose a risk to TOR (until and unless the version of OpenSSL that TOR uses is patched).  If NOT, then this bug does not affect TOR.
In any event, the BEST places to get information on OpenSSL and the Heartbleed bug are the official Heartbleed web site, and the OpenSSL mailing lists.
 From what I have read, the bug is a server side bug, and does not pose much risk to regular users (aside from the risk that your user names, passwords and other information in the RAM of servers that you have used in the past 2 years or so *MAY* have been compromised - though there are many other ways your information could be compromised).

'and to do so without leaving a trace that said information was extracted and by whom.', he should have added.
Yes, it is a significant risk, and as I understand it, there is no way to detect whether or not any given vulnerable server had information stolen by this bug.  There are a great many unknowns with this bug, and that makes me uncomfortable.  However, shutting down the Internet is a little extreme, don't you think?  Kind of like burning down your house because you think someone *MAY* have broken in without you knowledge.
To clarify:  Most regular (esp. non-TOR) users are not at *direct* risk from the bug (you'd basically have to be running a server configuration, with the vulnerability, as I understand it).  Also, Firefox is immune from *direct* attack since it uses NSS rather than OpenSSL for secure connections. *Indirect* risk is a whole other story - there simply is not enough information, and probably never will be, to assess the scope of that.
It absolutely should be patched now.  As far as who knew about it an when, that is another unknown.  I'd think it a safe bet that the NSA (and other intelligence agencies, here and abroad) found out about it before the official release of the CVE.  As for the baddies (identity thieves, etc.), who can say for certain, besides them (and we know they won't).
What concerns me about the NSA is not so much *when* they knew about it, but that they *do* know about it, given recent revelations about the scope and nature of their surveillance programs.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Heartbleed bug / Mainstream information 
The discussion on the Heatbleed bug has apparently stopped here, and just about everywhere else, but I found (courtesy of another mailing list), some more reports on it, that you may have not seen.  These reports suggest the the NSA knew about and exploited the bug for "at least" two years, and may have even worked to stop it from being reported and fixed.

The NSA, or course, denies any knowledge, or exploitation of the bug, but you can read the article and make your own decisions on that.

You can speak for everyone?  That's amazing.  I disagree on the NSA.  They are a major part of the problem - they introduce vulnerabilities into the Internet Infrastructure and block them from being fixed.  I have to wonder how many of their contractors had knowledge of this bug, and how many hackers got information about it from NSA contractors.
I agree that it is a big problem of how many sites have not/will not/cannot be fixed and how many people will be hurt by it.  It is also an issue of whether the fix for this bug *actually* fixes the bug, and whether this fix introduces new vulnerabilities into the software.

I am not subscribed to that list.  "NSA conspiracy theories"?  Is the information already released about the NSA surveillance not enough to not just dismiss such an idea that they may have known about and exploited it as a "conspiracy theory"?
Or maybe Snowden really was just an attention seeker, who really knew nothing.   That must be why the US sent a CIA kill squad after him - so he wouldn't spread "conspiracy theories" around.
