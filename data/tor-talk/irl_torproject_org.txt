Bad relays are removed by the directory authorities from the consensus.
By excluding relays in your torrc, you are harming your anonymity when
using the Tor network as your client is then not configured to behave in
the same way as everyone else's client.

This sounds cool.
I think you're going to need some levels of moderation. A model that may
work is pseudonymity as opposed to anonymity. If users keep the same
login name (which could be a randomly generated number you get when you
sign up, not even a chosen nickname) then they can build reputation.
I think there should be an option to use your real name. Enforced
anonymity takes away choice. I would choose to use my real name on such
a system so that others can see who I am when I give advice, and that
can in some way be trusted (verification of real world identities is a
whole other issue though).
You are almost certainly going to have to put resource into moderation.
If you run the service, you choose the rules. Don't worry about being
too restrictive, if someone wants a less restrictive service they can
run their own.
This should be up to the moderator. Real names are really only a pointer
to reputation in the same way that a pseudonym is.
Accessibility vs. moderator resources is a tradeoff. You can always
switch models if you find that the tradeoff is not working either way.
Giving good explanations of anonymity, pseudonymity and other concepts
as someone uses the site could be cool. Each step explains concepts that
are relevant.
This is up to you.
It would be beneficial, in my opinion, to not try to hide yourselves or
the server as this gives you the option of having a clearnet (non-onion)
version of the website which can be browsed, but then maybe you have to
use the onion service to post questions/interact with it.
You might like to take a look at this list of onion links:

Most open source projects have names, and their users have trust in
those names. If a project cares about its users then it should try to
protect its users from others that would seek to abuse that trust.

This flag does *not* mean that the relay is not recommended for use,
just that the version of tor it is running is not the currently
recommended version of tor. The relay operator should upgrade this, but
it is not something to be worried about.
Known dangerous versions of tor are rejected from the consensus and
would not be selected as your guard.
This flag is generated by Relay Search and is not present in the
consensus. It is not possible to exclude relays based on the version status.
Excluding relays based on their properties can harm your anonymity and
should be avoided unless carefully considered.

Can you provide some examples of things you can do with torstatus that
you can't do with Tor Metrics' tools?
Perhaps they are easy to implement.

Hi Conrad,
Tor Metrics has some data on average latencies for client to Onion
service. This is your absolute minimum latency, with the only way to
reduce this being to have latency-aware path selection or to reduce
latencies on the Internet (e.g. by swapping fibre for copper or copper
for microwave).
You get benefit from using an Onion Service over using an exit in that
you're using less constrained resources (exits are scarce) but you also
add extra hops to your circuit. For now, these extra hops do increase
latency. Configuring your onion service to not be location hidden would
improve this.
It would be interesting to see what kind of overheads are added by
OnionCat, but I see that this is a project that has an end in sight
unless someone comes up with a way to make it work with v3 Onion
Services. IPv6 addresses are not long enough to encode keys into to make
them self-authenticating. Either we need IPv7 or perhaps some
Onion-native network layer or something else.
If you have the endpoints that support it, Codec2 might give you some
benefits. This was originally designed for amateur-radio low bandwidth
digital voice but is also supported by Asterisk.
It might also be that half-duplex communication (even if implemented
with humans saying "over") could bring benefits as this would allow you
to increase the buffer sizes without having people talking over each other.

You still have 3-hops to the rendezvous point that are going through Tor
so it all still has to be TCP. You get to save though by not having
3-hops from the server side, and you cut down then to a 3/4-hop circuit
instead of 6. While OnionCat lets you pass UDP packets, they are still
encapsulated in TCP when they go over Tor and so are subject to
head-of-line blocking. You're also implementing some form of congestion
control on top of TCP's and Tor's congestion/flow control which can lead
to interesting effects for timer interaction (although for the RTP
streams you don't have retransmissions, just for the signalling).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Push-To-Talk over Tor (was: Tor VoIP PBX 
Someone recently showed me an app where you could record short videos
and send them in a push-to-talk style, for either near-synchronous or
asynchronous communication. They used it to send messages to their young
children while traveling. The first thing I thought when I saw this was
that this would be a perfect candidate for Onion services.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor VoIP PBX Architecture Discussion / Onioncat 
This is an area with a lot of open research questions. I understand that
users have different requirements, but as I understand it, v2 Onion
services will not be around forever and while I don't have data on this
I don't believe that there would be enough users to have the momentum to
fork the Tor network.
One thing I have discussed with the IETF Internet Architecture Board
(IAB) in the past is some sort of scheme for IPv6 addressing for overlay
networks. The result of that discussion was basically get an allocation
from your RIR. You can get a /32 giving you 96 bits to play with. If you
want you can announce it via BGP and provide gateways to the Internet
but it's not required. This gives you collision-free space.
The direct mapping between the IP address and an Onion service though is
the problem. How do you discover the Onion service public key when you
only have 96-bits of data?
I think I see it more as a transition-mechanism than an end goal. If I
had the time, it's 50/50 right now whether I would work on v3 OnionCat
or some Onion-native version of a protocol (via some kind of AF_ONION
sockets). An interesting fact I learnt recently is that FTP predates TCP
and was actually "ported" after its original development.
+1 would encourage anyone that wanted to do research in this area.

It is likely true that many sites that block Tor do so due to the
detection of a single abuse event. When you have ~2 million simultaneous
users sharing a couple of thousand IP addresses, this is going to
happen. They may not be specifically blocking Tor, although in other
cases they are.
The topic of exit censorship is an open research question. Some options

Hi Conrad,
My understanding from reading the -relays list is that there are a small
enough number of senders that it's possible to match on specific email
templates they are using, instead of trying to come up with a
generalized solution, and this still catches 90% of the mails.
One example can be seen at:
