@_subject: [tor-talk] meek-client debian packages 
Hash: SHA512
meek has not been [packaged in to
Debian]( as a
standalone client because of its increasingly high-coupling with TBB.
Related ticket on tor-trac:
However, yawning said in [Tor ticket
and has for quite a while.
The implementation of it can be found here:
Specific instructions:
1. [add TPO repository for core
2. [add TPO repository for
obfs4proxy]( (You only
need this when using obfs4proxy from Debian old stable repository
which is too old to support acting as a meek client);
3. `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install tor obfs4proxy`
4. Then, edit `/etc/tor/torrc` as follows (I am posting the real
bridge info here because the strategy behind `meek` is `collateral
freedom`, unlike the philosophy behind `obfs4` which is `security by
obscurity` ):
    DisableNetwork 0
    UseBridges 1
    ClientTransportPlugin obfs3,obfs4,meek_lite exec /usr/bin/obfs4proxy
    Bridge meek_lite 0.0.2.0:2
url= front=a0.awsstatic.com
Notice that it is `meek_lite`, NOT `meek` because this is a different
implementation, this is `obfs4proxy` acting as `meek` client.
