Hey Roman, the Tor Browser won't inherit Flash or Java- (script) for anonymity and security reasons. In the worst case, these addons will leak personal information like your real IP-address to third parties. Please have a look at the page  with a normal browser like Chrome or Internet Explorer and compare the results shown with those of the Tor Browser. The great advantage of anonymity is completely lost if you use such addons. Best Regards,

Hey Roman, better send your responses to the Tor maillist - Maybe someone with more technical knowledge of this problem can give us other insights or ideas. I think there's just too much work need to be done for creating a separate flash-build especially for Tor users. (Despite that Tor is not the right "organisation" for creating alternative flash-builds in general. Members of the Tor-Dev-Team have probably enough work keeping the core network running, stable and secure) But even if this work would be done, there are much more methods to identify users by using flashs fingerprinting: Flash is able to read the most of your system information directly from your hardware (Like HWIDs of you HDD and MAC-Addresses from network interfaces and so on) I've found an interesting thread in the blackhatwold about "socksifying" Flash:  There are solutions for using flash over socks proxies but none of them is really anonymous and/or usable on a daily basis without much effort. Just my 2cents - best regards from Berlin, Estevez ---- 25 Mai 2015 11:41:30 +0200 ????? ??????  ----
