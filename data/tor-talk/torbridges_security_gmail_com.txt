@_subject: Fix the middle router in Tor path ? 
Hi, everyone!
Can I fix the middle router in a Tor path, just like the EntryNodes and ExitNodes option in my Tor configuration file?
ok, just for fun!

@_subject: A question 
Hi, everyone!
There is a question! When I configure my Tor to use bridges to connect to network, how my Tor get other Tor routers' descriptors and information? Is it like:
MyTor -> bridges -> DirectoryServer and the DirServer returns the descriptors MyTor -> bridge and the bridge returns its own descriptors ?
Thanks a lot!

@_subject: a problem about run tor bridge 
Hi, everyone!
My computer is behind a NAT and I can connect to the Tor network directly ( not using Tor bridges although I am in China). Now I want to configure my tor as a bridge to let my friend connect to the Tor network. His IP is 172.18.12.xxx. My configuration file looks like:
BridgeRelay 1 ContactInfo hegaofeng at seu dot edu dot cn ControlPort 9051 ExitPolicy reject *:* Log notice stdout Nickname ORhgf ORPort 443 PublishServerDescriptor 0
RelayBandwidthBurst 10485760
RelayBandwidthRate 5242880
And my bridge information is: 172.18.12.161:443
But this dosen't work. The Vidalia is always stopping at "Loading relay information...".
I use Wireshark and find the TLS handshake is normal.
Can anyone tell me why? Thanks a lot!

The 172.18.12.161 is my private network address and the bridge is only intended to be used in the internal network.

first, you can't run any tor service behind NAT unless you can configure your firewall/NAT in order to enable port forwarding. By the way, what the hell is 172.18.12.161? Who can connect to that thing?
second, I do not think  "Loding relay information..." has anything to do with your recent bridge configuration.

My Tor is ok and connected to Tor network. However, my friend's vidalia is always stopping at "Loading relay information" when use my tor as bridge.

@_subject: hidden service  
hello, I want to set up a hidden server in my private network. I have successfully build a private tor network, including one directory server and 4 OR nodes, but when I add hidden service in one of the OR node, it has an error, the log is:
[warn] Publishing server descriptor to directory authorities of type 'Hidden service', but no authorities of that type listed!
I think the problem is in the directory server's configuration, how can I set up it to support the hidden service? Is there any example?

@_subject: [tor-talk] tor http proxy 
Hi, buddies.
I have configured the tor by vidalia ( Vidalia 0.2.14 and tor 0.2.2.33) to use a http proxy to connect the Tor network. But when I use the wireshark to test whether it works,
I find the proxy is not used and eventually the tor can't connect to the network(It is in China). The proxy is ok.
Is that all alright and any advice?
Thanks a lot!

I have used the kingate tool to setup a proxy server, including a Socks and Http proxy. When I configured tor to use the socks proxy, everything is OK. But when the http proxy is used,
it is neglected by the tor. The Vidalia reports:
