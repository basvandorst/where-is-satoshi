Hello everybody,
here an update.
After I wrote several emails to the server hosting company shinjiru  (shinjiru didn't answer), the company doing sushinjiru's technical  support (this company always replied, but they aren't responsible for  suspensions and they can only give answers to technical questions  because they only do technical support) surprisingly informed me, that  the server was "unsuspended". So I don't know why it was suspended and  I don't know why it was unsuspended.
Now the server has new IPs and this exit node will soon be back.
  Bye

Other issuers can be found by e.g. searching for "prepaid" and  "virtual". Other issuers, that I recommend ... after I found this  issuer and because I have had no problems with them I stopped  ordering/testing other cards/issuers. So my experiences with the  others are rather out of date.
At  there are less fees, BUT a real visa card (as far  as I know) is needed to buy/upload virtual cards.
At  the fees are a  little smaller, but in the same magnitude.
I don't know if these places are "more resonable". If you are going to  test some other cards/issuers, please mail your results. [As I  mentioned above, with the card444 cards I never had any problems with  the (extensive) fraud checks done by some "shops".]

Hello everybody,
on the 1st of January 2008 the web server provider shinjiru (Malaysia)  kicked my exit node acceptnolimits (traffic about 10 GB per day)  because of "abuse".
Before the contract (serveral months ago) I asked if they have a  problem with tor running on their servers (exit node) and they  answered "you are most welcome."
Up to now they have not answered my questions (about what happended).
Now I am looking for a new server provider. I asked iweb8.com, but  they told me, tor is only allowed as long as nobody complains. Hence  you can count the days until you get kicked there.
Does anybody here know a "kick-save" provider outside the US and  outside the EU, where it's possible to run tor exit node servers? What  is the price per month?

if hosting company = server provider then:
Yes I wrote two emails. They didn't respond. I don't write hardware  snail-mail letters, because completely anonymous server renting was  possible there.
My first goal is to find a new provider (if shinjiru doesn't want me  and my tor exit node any more).
My second goal is to find out what happened; what type of abuse there  was. Perhaps somebody hacked the server (OK, only ssh with key-login,  tor and apache where running, but who knows) and abused the server for  sending spams. In this case I would understand, why they shut down the  accept no limits

Sorry, I don't do it the "german" way: paying a lawer, going to court  and after months or years having a "result". And even if the judge  says: "OK you paid for another 3 months, they have to fulfil their  contract for another 3 month.", does this solve the problem? NO. After  this 3 months I have to search for another hoster. The only  difference: I paid a lawer, I paid the court, I lost month or years  and not to forget I am no longer anonymous. [I know no lawer or court  "working" for anonymous persons.]

Thank you for helping out
With a house (where you intend to live for years, you are not  anonymous) that's another story.

shinjiru explicitly allows anonymous hosting. You do not have to give  them your name, if you don't like. Only an email address is required,  the rest is optional.

Thank you for this hint. Actually the exit node is listed in SORBS with
"Likely Trojaned Machine, host running unknown trojan"
but the entry was last updated in 2007/10.

> shinjiru explicitly allows anonymous hosting.
  how does anonymous money transfer work in this case?
I got this question in personal mails after my posting, too.
So here a (short) answer:
They do not accept anonymous money, BUT the accept visa cards, and  especially they accept virtual prepaid visa cards.
So think out a name, address, etc. (just for the card) and you can get  one e.g. at card444.com.
How to pay card444.com anonymously? Take a look at their webpage and  choose a method you think it's anonymous. And of course, use tor all  the times ...

Somebody out there, PLEASE, to give some hints/answer to my ORIGINAL question?
Original question?? Yes, my original question: Can somebody recommend  a Non-US and Non-EU server provider (dedicated server) that has no  problems if the server is used as tor exit node?

You may have noticed their FAQ-section with e.g. the 12th question:
You have had a look at their main page with the many icons what  payment methods they accept? To name the simplest one (be careful this  is a personal opinion): Ukash (just get 19digit numbers and pay with  them), although it is very difficult if you don't live in UK, France,  Germany, Ireland, Netherlands or Spain to find a shop selling Ukash  numbers. Perhaps you have a friend there who buys the numbers and  mails them to you.
