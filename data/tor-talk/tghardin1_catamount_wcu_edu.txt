@_subject: [tor-talk] Can Tor run over Tor? 
I'm sitting here with my computer using my phone's internet via USB
tethering and have Orbot on my phone and TBB on my computer. If I set Orbot
to tunnel all tethered traffic through Tor and then open up TBB, am I
really running Tor over Tor?
If so, has anyone ever thought about the pros/cons of this? Obviously, it's
exponentially more inefficient. But is it any more secure?
