@_subject: [tor-talk] (maybe OT:) Dispute between RMS and WK on License Change 
This is a bit OT, but it might be of interest here, too.
I don't know whether you follow the GnuPG mailing lists, but in case you
missed it: there has been a dispute between Richard Stallman and Werner
Koch on a license change for the GNU Privacy Handbook (GPH).
I don't know them personally, but usually their wording in the mailing
lists is much more balanced; however in this case, there's been things
said that make me very concerned about the future of GnuPG, like
Currently it seems that the discussion has stopped without solution (or
maybe the "solution" to rewrite the documentation from scratch. IMHO not
a real solution).
To me, GnuPG is a key infrastructure component (same as Tor and the GNU
Project) and it makes me concerned, that RMS and WK seem to have a
personal conflict (as the arguments very quickly rose to a personal level).
What do you think on that situation? Is there a possibility to bring
them back to the round table, or otherwise solve the problem?
I don't want to post this on the GnuPG list, as it could look like
voting for one side. Maybe, what I want to achieve is that people who
are in closer contact with RMS/WK know about the issue and talk to them.
Of course I didn't ask RMS nor WK whether they would accept (or need) a
third party to mediate.
Both sides have reasonable arguments for their positions and personally,
I don't feel authorized enough to vote for one side.
