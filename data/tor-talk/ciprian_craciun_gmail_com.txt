Ok... Now this "block Romania" is getting silly... :D Not to
mention that it is not "politically-correct", especially on a mailing
list devoted to freedom of speech and access to information...
(Disclaimer: I am from Romania, and a home user of RDS...)
    What makes everybody think that here in Romania we haven't
discovered the hot-water yet? Indeed we do have the usual
script-kiddies and cracker-wana-be's, un-patched (better said cracked)
Windows installations, and the usual... But in a large portion
(99.99999...%) the population is a normal "Internet" citizen:
non-technical, using an assortment of Facebook, YouTube, etc...
    Thus why do people want to "block" us? Especially since most of
the cracker-wana-be's will most probably use Tor... (the irony)... :D
:D :D :D
    Really just think of it like this: China built their firewall to
keep their citizens off the "free Internet", but it seems that you
(and a few others) propose others to build firewalls around themselves
just to keep Romanian's out... And we are only 19 million people...
    As said... Getting silly...

A few decades ago this was a scarce commodity all over the eastern
Europe... (And currently still is in some "other" countries... But
let's not pick on them...)
    I won't comment on this...
    In fact we are talking here about "stereotypes"... The irony...
    And I'm sure there are other countries where this applies equally
well. (If you want I could provide you with my 25 thousand spam emails
I've collected, and you could do some statistics... Just to see where
the most spam comes from...)
    So you imply that "we" are the only ones doing these sort of crimes?
    Based on what you single us out? Based on what the media says?
Based on personal experience? Based on sociological studies? Based on
stereotypes? Based on gut feeling?
    And you think that only we have un-patched Windows-es? Really?!
    Of course this is one of the reasons. But again, did we crack it?
Just to put things into perspective: Windows 8 costs about 119$, while
the minimum wager in Romania is about 200$, and the average one is
around (if I remember correctly) 300$...
    Where do I get my numbers... Good question... Answer: I look around me...
    Where do you get your stereotypes? From the media?
    Of course that a "normal citizen" is a lazy computer illiterate.
But this happens so both in Romania, and any other country...
    Just to put it again into perspective: if "other country's"
citizens are more "computer literate", then why are there so many
successful phishing sites? Why do the most "popular" passwords are
still "password1" or "123456", etc.?
    Again, this is funny like hell...
