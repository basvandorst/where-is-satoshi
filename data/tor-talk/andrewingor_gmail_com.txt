@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB ExcludeNodes List, where is 
As you advised, I began to use the TBB sometimes
10x, good tools, although it doesn't always work correctly in the
interfaces of GoogDocs
1) "tor.exe" in the task list is no security on public terminal. Can I
hide (rename) that?
2) I wanna use ExcludeNodes of my torrc (i'm paranoic :o)
    And can't find this option in Tor Network Setting
    Would you teach me

sure, I would guess
and tor.exe at here

@_subject: [tor-talk] What is mean "Guard context default" 
I'm under harassment, always under watching. At several year I have
accumulated a collection of bad (aggressive) tor hosts and networks.I
append those to torrc
 (google docs)
It always worked, but today it broke. I can't change first gateway
(5.189.164.230) despite the fact that it is explicitly prohibited by
the ExcludeExitNodes rule (forbidden all 5.0.0.0/8).
(tor renamed to firefox, and i've the svchost-spy on my public terminal)

It's a hostile host-agent. It turn up my requests through a hostile territory.

Why the ExcludeExitNodes is not working and what is a simple way for
reliably control that?

@_subject: [tor-talk] What is mean "Guard context default" 
Yes. I had some troubles to looking for simple and good turning of torrc
1st of all, it is a bad English :-)
Yes. I changed ExcludeExitNodes to ExcludeNodes and all is well run
Sorry, folks
In my case, the (ff)attacker is owner of public computers. I've no
private device.
I've no admins rights. I'm under watching. I'm trying to earn some
money by programming. First time, I was illegally banned. Now, after
scandal, they interfere, they track. Not only in the inet.
I've got it, thanks, I'll use it
Chrome and Opera looks better. Working faster. I working with google
apps engine now, only Chrome has everything what I need for.
I using Tor Button extension or the Privoxy. It's working good.
Lot of thanks for all advice

That may be the result of the wrecking of the specials to impede the
existence of the Tor. I noticed that when I forbid nodes with
suspicious behavior, I have to torment the captcha much less often.
Try to create your's blacklist. You can see entry nodes here
 and exit nodes in
useragent.me or gmail account activity.
I also have serious claims to Google. He couldn't fix broken by bots
my ads in AdGoogle. He gives access to the security of China and
Russia to the stuff of the little me. He didn't hire me and didn't buy
any of my code.
But here's all of my stuff in the inet hosted by him. I have access to
my mailbox and gdrive through Tor.
Wow, it google translated correct, bravo :-))
We need be patient. Anyone has right to the court.
If not Pootin, aahhhhm, The Google, then whom? :)

But I want to tell mine joke.
Mr. Linus complained that he still continues to want a desktop. The
noise in the conference room, and the young guy in the hoody ask: "Do
not scold me very much, everyone was a lamer! Tell me please, what is
the desktop?"
Sorry for off topic.

Yes, it is. Tor is a special instrument for special task. Of course,
the entire network should work as a torus, it is safety (I can to
indulge in dreams). Special services and organized by they crime
actively and aggressively work against the torus.
Persecution takes place in a very simple way. Special services track
down what you do, and all that you do - to break. It is enough for a
few years, sometimes months, to turn anyone into a homeless person or
bring to suicide.
If you think that the agent is wearing a suit and tie, you are
mistaken. An agent is a homeless who digs in your garbage can. He does
not even have to pay, he gets money from social assistance, which is
under the control of special services.
If I see the captcha, I understand that the host is somehow
compromised. It on the contrary helps me to disappear.

This is your fantasy, Ms. Croft.
The eastern jails has not a computer with a torus, often there is no
normal toilet (sometimes that this is just a pit in the ground). Cell
phones are forbidden (I threw my phone myself when I realized that he
was constantly being watched).  From a city phone I was allowed to
make only a local call in an unfamiliar city.
In a hostel for accommodating refugees in Moldova, about a month I was
forbidden to computers and the Internet class under far-fetched
pretexts. When through the scandal I have achieved admission to, I was
strictly forbidden to remote work. After my escape through four
countries, I do not have my own computer, not even a smartphone. I
have not get paid for local work.
You presented to dictators with the new high technology, as well as
the atomic bomb in the past,  that they use without conscience against
human rights. Special services use the tracking and blocking of
communications, the hacking of computers in ordinary civil life in
order to influence the ordinary civil destiny of ordinary people.
There is no way to regulate their influence, they are "good guys" and
us are forbidden to touch them, and it's just dangerous. They will
necessarily take revenge, they never forget and do not forgive. Cause
"they" it is your name in the database marked with a red cross.
Now the situation is that the torus is just necessary to hide what
news do you read, where do you work, who your friends are. Your life
can be broken simply because of personal dislike.

IMHO, the DNS it was very bad idea, it is very big hole. Particularly
hampered by its global status in all OSes: management by only
superuser. Local user can't change the service, even can't create own
hosts in the windows. Why?!
As a result, even a personal smartphone need to be hacking (rooted) to
have protection by ISP. And the tools available for this are highly
questionable, they are rather trojans.
On the public terminals I can use the torus (lot of 10x), can hide
information in crypts, but the host on which I get through a
super-secret torus easy can be a mirror of real with MITM by simple
Even for rooted devices the DNSSEC is not a good decision. Like VPN,
it is easily monitored and blocked or sabotaged (jamming is put on the
connection), forcing the inexperienced user to stop unwanted
experiments (I saw that).
The DNS must be use through Tor. It maybe special service inside
(include) the Tor.
For more satisfaction.
