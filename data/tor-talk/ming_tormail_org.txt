@_subject: [tor-talk] Bug Remains: OpenSSL library does not load unless 
This is a followup post on this issue which persists in Linux TBB 32bit, version 2.2.37-2.
Any idea for the cause?
What occurs when it doesn't list the library loading (is the library loading?) and why it's listed
only on a TBB reload?
Below is a copy/paste from my original post as a refresher:
(I do realize a bug report page/ticket for this exists, but has it been updated?)

:Example A : Loaded via start-tor-browser script without any changes, fresh install of current TBB:
Tor v0.2.2.35 (git-[snip]). This is experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity.

Bootstrapped 100%: Done.
() Example A/Notations/Questions and fact: The OpenSSL library is not loaded in Vidalia's Message
1. How is it establishing an encrypted directory connection and continues to function without
loading the OpenSSL library?
2. Is it loading the OpenSSL library but suppressing the text output in Vidalia for some reason?
3. Is my TBB session, when loaded with the process in Example A, vulnerable to attack (MiTM/Or..)?
4. Is my TBB session, when loaded with the process in Example A, really encrypting content? One
would think there would be errors and/or a failure to start correctly if OpenSSL isn't loaded at
5. The graphic on the Tor check page:  does not load!
6. Could this be a case of Tor connecting to a "faked/private" Tor network, maybe ISP or hacker
(MiTM) based?

1. The graphic on the Tor check page:  loads!

3. Unlike  above, exit node reports are always positive.
(?)4. Strange "rediscovery" of known bridges, appearing as "new bridge descriptor 'name' (fresh)"
   but they were manually imported through Vidalia and shown within the Message Log earlier as
   a Learned Fingerprint and a 'name' (cached). If the TBB session remains active for several
   hours, these manually entered bridges continue to repeat being discovered as (fresh)!

@_subject: [tor-talk] ControlPortWriteToFile line added to torrc by Vidalia 
Since the last version and continuing with the current version of Linux TBB 32bit, there is an
extra line added to torrc on TBB reload, by Vidalia, with steps to reproduce:
* Directory:
* Extra Line of Data Added:
ControlPortWriteToFile /home/madeinchina/tor-browser_en-US/Data/Tor/port.conf
* Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch TBB with 'start-tor-browser' script, wait until browser appears
2. After any amount of time, add a few bridges in Vidalia
3. Allow the new bridges to 'take', several seconds
4. Stop Tor and exit, which will close Tor, Vidalia, and browser
5. Restart TBB with script, check the 'torrc' file for changes,
   you'll notice the extra line above added by Vidalia.
I also see 'ControlPort auto' listed, but I'm unclear as to when this was added. I did notice the
'ControlPortWriteToFile' entry as something new with the previous version of TBB 2.2.37-1.
Currently I'm using 2.2.37-2.
Is this a bug?
Why did it appear just recently?
Why does Vidalia add the line, with bridges used, on a restart? I haven't tested it without
bridges and a simple stop/exit/restart.

Lively blog[1], a free blogging service, offers a special configuration[2] for Tor users. It's the
first free blogging service on the open web I've discovered which encourages Tor users to join and
blog anonymously. (unlike the .onion sites which require Tor in order to access and usually
experience poor up time and longevity)

@_subject: [tor-talk] 2.2.35-11, TBB Linux: network.websocket.enabled = true, 
With this blog entry:
It claims 2.2.35-11 fixes a problem posted here:
With Tor Browser Bundle (2.2.35-11); suite=linux installed, I read where it
was fixed in the changelog:
* New Firefox patches:
- Prevent WebSocket DNS leak (closes: But when running this new bundle version, network.websocket.enabled
remains set at true.
How was this patched when the value remains set as true? Shouldn't the
above value now be set at false?
The former blog post, prior to the recent release, states:
"To fix this dns leak/security hole, follow these steps:
Type ?about:config? (without the quotes) into the Firefox URL bar. Press
Type ?websocket? (again, without the quotes) into the search bar that
appears below "about:config".
Double-click on ?network.websocket.enabled?. That line should now show
?false? in the ?Value? column."
Unless this was patched elsewhere in the browser (if so, where?) how has
Tor Browser Bundle (2.2.35-11); suite=linux
been patched to resolve this issue when the same field,
?network.websocket.enabled? appears as true in this new release?
