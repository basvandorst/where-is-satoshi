The current tor version on this system built fine from
tor-0.1.1.24-tor.0.fc5.src.rpm. Why is the newer 0.1.1.25 a problem!?

No chance. This is a VIA C3 Nehemia CPU from a VIA EK8000 board.
Maybe my .rpmrc matters?
optflags: i386 %{__global_cflags} -m32 -march=c3-2 -pipe
-fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -finline-functions -mfpmath=sse,387
is the line for i386.
What tests could I do to find the cause?
Please let me know!

Anybody here got some experience with tor and openssl hardware
I run a tiny tor server on my ADSL line, on a VIA EK8000 board which
supports VIA PadLock (no-RNG, ACE). (i.e. AES support and a hardware RNG)
I compiled support in the kernel and patched openssl with patches from
 to make padlock static and
default, etc.
Is this enough for tor to use openssl with the hardware support?
Do I need to patch tor?
(like openssh?)
Any ideas?

With the previous tor experiences in mind w.r.t. services blocking me, I thought about IPv6.
I could run a somewhat open relay on an IPv6 number via a IPv6 in IPV4 tunnel if I (ever) get that to work. My isp (xs4all) offers such a tunnel for free and a (small?) IPv6 subnet to go.
a) does tor work well with IPv6?
b) how is the added value for the tor network? (IPv6 vs IPv4?)
c) how well would the IPv6 setup work w.r.t. my IPv4 number(s) being blocked by whatver server/service/etc.

I tried 0.2.2.6 (latest I saw) and noticed that both that version and my
own patched 0.2.1.20 have some trouble to connect to their own OR-port
for the initial circuit test. The unpatched 0.2.1.20 had no real trouble
there and the circuit test succeeds quickly.
How could I help find the root cause to this issue?

No exit here.
Still it dies.
Not everyone has ipv6 yet.
Also the implementation might differ from place to place.
My experience was first with the wide-dhcp (no script, just simple
hacks), now it is isc dhclient as it is distributed with Fedora.
Need to patch dhclient to work with ppp (!) and to patch dhclient-script
to make it work with prefix delegation.
So if we don't use ppp but still use isc dhclient we might see this
issue in more places as dhclient-script fills resolv.conf with the input
from the dhcp-server(s).
So yes, the problem is possible but not too often...

Tor chokes and stops when it finds ipv6 numbers in resolv.conf.
Is this a known issue?
I found out about this as the Fedora dhclient-script (part of ISC
dhcp-4.2.0) wipes out resolv.conf and replaces it with whatever the
dhclient receives.
Please discuss if this is reasonable behaviour (by tor) and/or hwo we
could work around this.

I sued the spec and assorted source files from the src.rpm.
I changed the user/group to _tor and built the rpm, then installed.
See above.

Recently (due to teh Fedora src rpm) I also noticed there is a

@_subject: [tor-talk] exit ports to open in relay *without* issue... 
In the past I opened up some 'innocent' exit ports and after a while my ISP detected a Windows virus of some sorts from my IP('s).
So I went to relay only and that problem was fixed.
Then I thought I was `smart` and opened just a few ports that (normally) carry SSL-protected connections.
Same thing happened, the ISP detected some (other) virus activity after a while.
As I do not run Windows at all, these virus detections must come via the tor exit ports.
Is there a 'safe' choice in this that will not trigger virus activity?
Of course the normal SSL-protected traffic does not mean the virus will do the same...
So what can I do besides run non-exit?

But local ISP is only one side.
The virus stuff goes somewhere and will also be detected elsewhere.
Then mail will be blacklisted (because a virus does not send mail!?), etc.
This will impact the usability of my internet connection.
How to avoid this *and* still allow some exit?

Any devs reading here?

Issue is still happening, with just port 22 and 53 open.
What can I do to help fix the issue?

A bit of time has passed since the feedback on the 'new' torproject website.
It appears nothing has changed there....
What is the plan here?
Should we accept changes as this one as 'normal'?

I'd avoid it.

This could explain what improved in the latest version(s).

Who changed the web content at  ?
Previously I could relatively easily check for the latest tor version
but now I get only a number of tor browser options in a page that is way
too big for what it offers. (and I use a 4K screen)
Why was this done? What purpose does it serve for tor? (not the browser)
And where is one supposed to find the tor download page from that (now)
tor browser page?

The new design does provide nothing for me:
As I described I used to find tor source code on there.
Now there is a 'new' interface that only tries to `sell` tor-browser to me.
There is no other choice there than tor-browser.
There is no link there to the tor source code.
There is no reference anywhere on the  site to
that source code that I could find after being confronted with this
'new' interface.
Not even tor.torproject.org (which would be logical, looking at websites
for other software on torproject.org) exists.
So can you please understand the frustration that you have started to
cause with this `new` interface?
I am a user, but do NOT think the new website (that particular page
especially) is more welcoming, nor concise and it does not provide links
for exactly the version this user needs.
The old interface on that page was small, simple and direct.
Why was there no difference made between the tor binary/source and the
tor browser binaries?
I do think this is a huge error.

Check the text at  How do I download Tor if the torproject.org is blocked?
If you can't download Tor through our website, you can get a copy of Tor
delivered to you via GetTor. GetTor is a service that automatically
responds to messages with links to the latest version of Tor Browser,
hosted at a variety of locations that are less likely to be censored,
such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and GitHub.
Tor != tor browser.

Via the FAQ link I got to (in order) these and finally found a tor
download link:

I see.
Is that helping tor?
It looks like the website maintainers do not understand tor well enough.

@_subject: [tor-talk] 0.4.0.5 
At  I found
that tor (not the browser) 0.4.0.5 is available...
How to find that source code via the 'new' website? (some time has
passed but did anybody take action after the feedback posted here?)
Kind regards,

@_date: 2019-05-04 16:25:05
@_author: Udo van den Heuvel 
@_subject: [tor-talk] 0.4.0.5 
Yes, it is on the website.
But how to find it, when we start at  ?
Kind regards,
