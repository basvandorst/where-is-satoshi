Hey all,
I was unable to find this question in the documentation, so I'll ask it
here. I hope it's the right place.
What happens when two servers running TOR provide a hidden service using
the same private key?
Which one will get the requests for that service? Will it be distributed
randomly, or will there be some kind of conflict?

Thanks for your clear answer. Yes, I certainly think there are interesting
possibilities there.
