@_subject: [tor-talk] I cannot see Tor anywhere 
Hi everyone, not sure how this mailing list works but here goes:
I downloaded Tor but cannot see it when I extract it.
I downloaded this:
7z SFX
Igor Pavlov
I have three copies of this in my downloads folder and when I double click on one of them it extracts but then I can't see anything on my computer relating to the extracted/opened program and nothing in firefox. It's as if Tor is an empty file or something. I have win XP sp3.
How do I get to see tor and make it work?
Also is there a mailing list preferences section where I can adjust my mailing preferences?
