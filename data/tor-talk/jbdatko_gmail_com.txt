Gordon Morehouse has been spending a lot of time getting the Pi to run as
Tor relay: I've been running a BeagleBone Black relay on a home network for over 2
months now:

Also, Bitcoin is not anonymous [1].  So while relays are public, generally
the Tor clients take great pains to not disclose their identities.  If
clients starting tipping relays, to their relay public key, a good attacker
would guess would be that a Tor client used that relay.  Then I think some
linkage attacks would be possible.
Also, and I think this was discussed on this list before, offering payment
may actually decrease the number of volunteers [2].
I was initially interested in researching a technical way to offer payments
to relays by the clients joining a mining pool and somehow paying the relay
from the pool (something like ring signatures).  But there is a lot of
technical complexity linking these two systems.   Also, as evidenced by
Roman's email and [2], this may shift social behaviors in the Tor network
for the worse.

As I tried to watch Family Guy, I received this message from Hulu:
Based on your IP address, we noticed you are trying to access Hulu through
an anonymous proxy tool.  Hulu is not currently available outside the U.S.
 If you're in the U.S., you need to disable your anonymizer to access
videos on Hulu.
If you think you're receiving this message in error, please submit this
I run a non-exit node (On a BeagleBone Black) and I'm in the U.S.
Once the wife sees this, my BeagleBone might have an *accident*.  Although
I'm not sure that will get our IP off the blacklist :P

No, my relay runs on a separate computer (same public facing IP).  I've
been using Hulu before with the relay running w/o issue which is why I was
so surprised.
My relay's uptime is 153 days... so I don't know.  Netflix still works :)

So, I should clarify:
The computer on which I received this error was not running Tor at all.
 Not as a daemon; not the TBB.
I run a non-exit relay, on my same home network and thus the same public
facing IP as my public facing relay.
My conclusion that Hulu blocks Tor was based on the following: I run a
public relay -> my IP is listed as running a Tor relay -> I received this
Hulu nasty message -> therefore Hulu must be blacklisting my IP because I
run a Tor relay.
Sorry for the confusion.

For completeness (nobody likes a story with a hanging....  ending :p ),
access to Hulu is restored.  Below is the email I sent them and their
My msg:
I run a non-exit Tor relay on my home network. This allows Internet users,
who are censored, to access the Internet and protects users who wish to
keep their privacy while online. There is a great description of who uses
Tor at: As you can tell, my IP is based in the U.S. and I would like to access
Hulu. Can you please lift the blacklist on my IP?
Hi Joshua,
Thank you for contacting us. I'm sorry about the anonymous proxy message
you're seeing. A proxy is a server that acts as an intermediary between
your computer and the Internet. It's possible to use an anonymous proxy and
not realize it.
However, after further investigation, I've confirmed that your IP address
was incorrectly categorized to be an anonymous proxy. I have submitted a
request to approve your IP address for use and you should be up and running
in about 3-5 days. If the error appears after this time definitely reach
out to us and we'll be happy to dig a bit deeper.
Once again, I'm very sorry for the inconvenience. If anything else comes
up, please don't hesitate to write back.
Hulu Support
