Since this morning I encounter a sudden problem with my Tor-Browser (7.5).
Upon start of the browser and an attempt to test the network settings I get a message saying:
Problem loading page - Secure connection failed. The browser has been working flawlessly for about 2 wks. Have triedall possible things to fix it myself - to no avail.
What is the reason and how can I fix this problem?
Thanks for help and tips.

Virtually with any page I try. As said, it happens prior testing the tor network connection - although the browser says I can safely surf.

Does this happen with one particular website only or with any
website you try to open?

1. click on Start Tor Browser icon (shortcut) on desktop => Wlcome To Tor Browser appears and You are now free to browse the Internet anonymously.
2. click on Test Tor Network Settings => error message appears (Sec. Conn Failed and also 'The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading.' plus 'The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because the authenticity of the received data could not be verified.' and 'Please contact the website owners to inform them of this problem.'
At the bottom in a status line connecting to and connected to check.torproject.org toggels quickly followed by 'Try again'. This however, does not change anything - the procedure repeats avery time.
In the URL window (info icon) appears: 'Check.Torproject.Org' 'Connection is not secure' and PERMISSIONS says 'You have not granted this site any special permissions.'
Does this info help?

can you try to describe in more detail what you see and what you do?
for example:
- you click the torbrowser icon on your desktop
- a small window with a progress bar appears
- when the progress bar is at 100% tor browser opens
displaying "Welcome to Tor Browser"
- then you click on "Test Tor Network Settings" in the middle of the page
-  opens
-> and then you get "Secure connection failed."

Have done both - no change.
I have also noticed, that the first time  1. click on Start Tor Browser icon (shortcut) on desktop => Wlcome To
Yes much better, thanks.
Does that also happen after you click the arrow next to the onion and click on "New Identity"?
if that does not solve the problem:
Can you try to download a fresh torbrowser into a new folder and see if that solves your problem?

Have Kaspersky (18.0.0.405 (g)) on my system. Have done as you suggest, however, no change.
Yesterday late night I could access few web pages via tor, but most pages return the same message (secure connection failed with the whole nine yards). Also have not made any changes to my config, nor am aware of any other updates of KIS software other that the daily databases.
What would I need to do to run tor browser directly without installing it on my PC? (Could be worth a try...?)

There is a bunch of other people suddenly having a similar issue, too. I
wonder if any of you has some third party software installed (e.g.
antivirus/firewall software) that got an update and is now intefering
with your traffic.
If you have such a tool running, could you uninstall it for testing
purposes (disabling might not be enough) and report back whether that
fixes it for you?

Yes, I have downloaded the torbrowser from the https:// you mention today (and re-installed it) but no change. Strange enough, there is still no entry in the Start menu as it was for the first time. Should there be one?
Have also checked the metrics page. There were several rejections among the accepted entries. Is that correct? Among others IPv6 was not detected, and several Ips were rejected.
Unfortunately my back-up PC gave up almost a year ago so I don`t have the chance to try it on other PC. But I made no changes to my config - I do not change horses in the race ;-).
Do I have to contact IRC (what would be their contact address) or could you pass it over to them?
Regards and thanks for your help.

rather strange
did you download your torbrowser from here?
tor browser should not require an actual installation (it can be executed directly)
just pages with HTTP*S* or also HTTP (no s at the end)?
You can also manually check if you are browsing via tor by copying
 or and copying that IP to this search field:
but I would be suspicious if there are some problems with your setup,
maybe you can try on a second computer?
it might be hard to solve this non-interactively, maybe IRC
would be more suitable here
could you let me know if this is a request from you: (so I we can
tell if there are multiple persons having this problem)

Have forgotten to mention that both HTTPS as well as HTTP pages don't work properly.

Since today early in the morning cannot connect to " on the 'Welcome page'
although upon clicking 'Start Torbrowser' button the connection seems to be established. I.e. the situation is getting worse.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Still ticket #2533 
Have not hear anything re above ticket for a while. Still having the same problem 'Secure connection failed' and unable to 'Test tor network settings'. What are the latest developments?
Upon Testing tor network settings the bottom status line toggles between connecting/connected  to  until the Secure connection failed appears.
Have not changed setup at all since the vrowser worked flawlesly.
Any idea what else to do?
Thanks and regards
