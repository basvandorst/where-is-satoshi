@_subject: [tor-talk] A possible solution to traffic correlation attacks, 
After about an hour of brain storming I may of found a way to stop traffic correlation attacks. The idea is to add an artificial delay of a few randomized ms (two separate delays, one to the tor exit and another deal on traffic exiting the network) and add an extra chunk of randomized data (just a small random amount of KB that never exits the network). It would make traffic harder to correlate. What are your thoughts on this?

Wow I just read the site. It makes me quite sad, the videos of his presentations never indicated he would do something like that. The site users place holders for many stories. That makes me somewhat concerned. The statement made by the tor project ( blog is even more concerning. I'm really surprised that something like this would happen. I've always trusted the statements he made. Now I'm not sure. I haven't seen any articles in the news yet.

I'm seriously wondering if the site / rumors was setup by a government agency (from some country, not sure which one to suspect) to attack Jacob Applebaum or even harm the reputation of the infosec community as a whole because if one member looks really bad it could harm all of us despite lack of involvement in an event that may or may not be true.

I couldn't agree more with your statement. Someone quickly makes an accusation by the way the domain and hosting was done anonymously. It's hosted by  with Privacy Protected Whois Contact Information by "Privacy Protection Service INC d/b/a PrivacyProtect.org". If they are going to make such a statement they could at least state who they are. The site has several resource links to a GitHub Repository and even links to Jacob's Github Account (or what appears to be). I'm not sure if they are trying to make it look like Jacob made the site himself (if so it was done from a private repository). It might be worth mentioning that  is offline at the moment. I'm not sure if it's been like that or not. Any thoughts.

I agree. There isn't proof (yet at least) that he did anything wrong. I agree that like everyone else he should have the right to a fair trial. Your correct the tor project shouldn't and I also believe wouldn't attempt to censor speech (considering that they develop an online anonymity and anti-censorship tool). I also agree that due to many (not all) people's lack of ability to read everything before making up their mind it makes it all the more easier to harm someone's reputation. There might be people who were actually hurt but we don't know if it's true

The idea of downloading the Wikipedia archives is pretty good since it doesn't note the content you were looking for. Another idea is to use search engines that protect your privacy such as ixquick or duckduckgo (they store search queries but they don't track individuals (I.e they don't store your IP Address, as far as we know that is).

I do not have any beta code. This was merely a suggestion. The added randomized delays (two separate sets) and randomized data padding (two separate sets) would make it more difficult to correlate traffic. I think it could be done in a way that still allows Tor to keep latency

Do you have a copy of all government documents from every government in the world? Unless you do and you are willing to share them all we have no proof that there isn't a government agendy to discredit him, we also have no proof that there is. What we do know is that it's a possibility. The Wikipedia page for Jacob Applebaum actually has incorrect information. The first allegations were not made public on the Tor Blog, the article actually states "Over the past several days, a number of people have made serious, public allegations of sexual mistreatment by former Tor Project employee Jacob Appelbaum.". If I recall correctly a link was posted on the tor-talk mailing list. Does anyone have an exact time when the statement by the tor project was released. The first email discussing it (the one with the website link) was sent out on "Sat Jun 4 19:22:42 UTC 2016".

So randomizing the times that traffic enters the network and exits the network wouldn't work? Like it enters a note and 30 ms after received or another random delay couldn't it exit. It would be harder to correlate the traffic right?

That's a good idea. If we could get a system of micro delays which wouldn't cause major issues it'd be nice in protecting Tor users anonymity. It's an issue that has been acknowledged by the tor project but we haven't been able to find a working system yet. I think it's more important then ever that we begin to address these issues.

Absolutely whoever is monitoring (aka spying) on your traffic if they see you downloaded everything it's hard to determine what your looking for. Personally the idea of storing a ton of data isn't the best for me so rather I simply use Tor + private search engines and trust it to protect me.

I have a few suggestions:
* Use SSH Key Based Authnication only (no password based login)
* Update your software frequently
* Enable IPTables and only allow ports that you utilize, if you have a static ip address only allow connections to ssh from that ip address
* Enable Tripwire to detect changes to system files
Good luck with securing your VPS

Your setup isn't safe. The proper setup is to have tor running in the "Proxy VM" and then then have the "App VM" tunnel all traffic over through the Proxy VM. I'm not sure why you are using JonDo. Since they first charge for their services and because of it have billing records and they are also proven to keep logs on the amount of bandwidth you Keep in mind they state:
"Only the following non-individual-related information sent by your browser is stored:
the visited webpage (URL)

in their privacy policy.
You are by no means anonymous while using JonDo nor safe as since they store the information they could be forced to hand it over. It puts you at risk. Just setup a traditional who-nix setup.
