@_subject: openbsd 3.6 installation from stable source (0.1.0.15) 
dear list,
i first installed libevent 1.1a using:
./configure --prefix=/thisdir
sudo make install
no errors occured.
i then installed tor using:
./configure --includedir=/thisdir/include --libdir=/thisdir/lib
sudo make install
no errors occured.
then when executing tor it complains that i am using an old version  of libevent and tor will be buggy.
I think the problem is that I have never really understood how to  compile source packages with certain libraries/includes that are not  in standard paths.
apologies for such a newbie question.

i have looked in the ports collection and tor does not seem to be  there. it is openbsd 3.6 i am using.
is tor actively maintained in the ports tree on openbsd? or is it  best to use the latest stable source release from the tor site?
thanks for your help Dimitry.

I believe(and hope) a great many people care about this.
Does anyone know of other papers written on the subject of 'abuse' of  anonymous systems?
at the moment I personally feel that Tor is affording people with  questionable intentions an extremely robust and simple to use method  to conceal their identity.  I have not read the 'challenges' paper  but is it correct to think tor developers justify (if that is the  right word) their developments by believing that if miscreants did  not use Tor they would simply move onto another similar mechanism for  conducting their business.
or would taking the tor network down cause any kind of disruption?
impossible questions....

@_subject: can someone give me a pointer...? 
I am having problems setting up my LAN gateway (192.168.1.1) to run  Tor and privoxy so my LAN clients web traffic can be anonymised and  My gateway has the following line in the /etc/privoxy/config
forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .
listen 192.168.1.1:8118
the torrc on my gateway has the following lines in it:
SocksPort 9050
SocksBindAddress 127.0.0.1
and so my os x clients have the following settings:
http proxy = 192.168.1.1 port 8118
https proxy = 192.168.1.1 port 8118
but this is not working for some reason (firewall has been  temporarily turned off).
I am unsure whether Tor should bind to the LAN interface  (192.168.1.1) and set the os x clients SOCKS proxy to 192.168.1.1  port 9050.
can anyone help?

so glad you tagged your sarcasm, I don't think I would have picked up  on it :(
As to knowing what the likely disruption to people would be if Tor  didn't exist, I am not sure just thinking about it could answer this  question, which is probably why I alluded to the question's  as to history and technical knowledge, I am aware of freely available  anonymous  proxy lists that people can bounce through, or even their  own compromised network of machines, however I guess I meant the ease  of which a Tor client is installed and ready to use - it is the  beauty of Tor that with such ease comes an extremely powerful method  of hiding.  An average user of computers will have no problem using  Tor, however they might have a harder task tracking down open proxies  and/or compromised hosts.  This is what I meant by causing disruption.
thanks for being condescending though, really helpful and encouraging.

My original posting came before you pointed me to the documents,  however I should have read whatever documentation was out there  before posting on this list.
ah, no sarcasm tagging, now I really don't know what to think ;)
