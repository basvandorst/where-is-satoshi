Yes, if not for the fact that Tor have been *COMPLETELY* receptive to
criticisms about how they run things.
Its not as if some members of Tor are bigoted and walk around with a chip
on their shoulder against 'enemies'.

The things that the some Tor members have done in the past, in regards to
some less then becoming behavior in public, is pretty indicative of the
reason why they're getting "harassed".

I don't represent the lizards, but when legitimate concerns are hand-waved
away, perhaps it should be shown the the emperor has no clothes. I
personally dislike the attitudes of more people than andrea, and quite
frankly coming out as anti-'harassment', saying that tor shouldn't exist to
support misogynists, is hardly the way to respond to criticism. Sure, the
lizard botnet quickly registered 8000 accounts with 20kb links, while they
were hammering away at the directory servers, but a less trivial and
noticeable attack is possible. Unless there is some significant staff
changes in the future, I'm with the lizardsquad in exposing tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Clarification of Tor's involvement with DARPA's Memex 
It has been said time and time again, that tor is not robust enough to
protect you from state actors, who ultimately control the underlying
network. The tor project has answered criticisms of collaboration and
security, with the doxxing and harassment campaign against journalists
while claiming that they are indeed victims of misogynistic harassment.
Then Tor takes a stand against such "harassment" as the vanguards of
feminism, and then starts inferring that a right not to be offended, and so
itself filtering / censoring rational and critical comments.
Things like this pushed away developers like myself, even though I've been
worked a little bit with developing hidden services and tor, because I
don't feel assured that its a viable platform, and I literally abhor jacob,
kelly, griffin, jillian, and andrea. I mean they literally say shit like
this Karen Reilly "My white privilege included hanging out in a park
after dark with LARPers without getting shot." " I wouldn't work for Tor if it was a shield for misogynists. We
work with victims of abuse."  .
Then of course there is the matter of the operation onymous and
lizardsquad, which really goes to show how vulnerable the network is, and
how such issues are just swept under the rug. Then Andrew Lewman
coordinating more with LE, and leaving TOR to go work for an ISP
(presumably Verizon), which seems alot like a conflict of interest. It all
leaves me thinking that Tor is a double edged sword just like any other
tool, but the ones with the most financial interest and as a 'stakeholder'
in the tor network, is the US "cyber defense" / surveillance establishment.
Which is why I am more interested in developing alternatives, and actively
steering people away from tor, if they are looking for real anonymity or

There is the implication that the tor network can be used for exactly that

How does Ed Snowden not getting caught, have to do with Tor being immune
from flaws, by that logic I have a tiger repelling rock to sell you (money
back guarantee).
The argument being made by some, is that Ed Snowden was a pawn in a turf
war between NSA / FBI, by the way he calls himself a patriot, and limited
disclosure to save US interests.
While it's guilt by association, what many dislike is that he has aligned
himself with tor and EFF, who seem to be also getting more comfortable with
government and censorship themselves.

This has been discussed in the past here, specifically with darpa / memex
thread, and the pando saga, and some documents submitted to UK parliment.
When tor and EFF "stand up against harassment", by supporting doxxing and
harassment by their own members, who go on bigoted and discriminatory rants.
Kelly and Jacob agree that Tor isn't for misogynistic harassers, its only
for victims of oppression by the kyiarchy, repeat it enough times maybe
it'll be true.

Except that TOR says they're going to help LEO with stop cyber criminals
according to briefings with UK parliament.
"you should treat me how I want to be treated" and "your rights end where
my feelings begin" are awfully close to one another.
I see government corruption within infosec to be a bigger ill, than whether
or not there is enough social justice, and its used most frequently by
charlatans and fools.
Thats not to mean that Tor is a government honeypot but its not secure
enough, but if the government makes tor popular people will not be
persuaded to more effective models.
