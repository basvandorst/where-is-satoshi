@_subject: servers using netbios?? 
Hi or-talk,
I'm totally confused by the following situation. My firewall is
blocking some outgoing UDP connections from port 137 (netbios) to port
137. This has happened twice and both times the remote IP was of a Tor
server. Netbios should not be going to the internet, my firewall did right.
What confuses me is how these connections were started to begin with.
My firewall does not think the application was Tor.
The local port was not of my ORport.
Default exit policies specifically prohibit traffic on ports 135-139.
The protocol is UDP which is not possible to be handled by Tor.
But despite all these impossibilities, there is a link somehow with
Tor because the destination IP are of two Tor servers. How can this

Hi Oliver,
I am having the same difficulty since that time frame as well. Still
can't connect as server.

It will build endlessly like this and periodically I get a
"not managed to confirm its ORPort/DirPort reachable".
I've tried the obvious stuff such as bypassing firewalls but its not
it. Tried 0.1.0.14 and 0.1.1.5-alpha, changing ports, restarting,
nothing works. Mysteriously, there were brief times when everything
went alright but it's been a couple of days that I simply can not
connect as server. I've never had an outage like this for so long.
I can't make anything useful from the debug log, would it help if I
posted it here?

@_subject: Config for LAN? 
Hi or-talk,
I'm a little doubtful with the settings for a LAN. I wish to run a
server and use the client for all computers internally on the LAN. I
also wish to listen in non-standard ports (WAN). My concern is to do
this safely without having WAN connections to 9050.
Should it be:
SOCKSPort 9050
SOCKSBindAddress 127.0.0.1
SOCKSPolicy accept 192.168.0.1/24
SOCKSPolicy reject *
orport 443
dirbindaddress 0.0.0.0:9001
dirport 80
dirbindaddress 0.0.0.0:9030
or should it be:
SOCKSPort 9050
SOCKSBindAddress 192.168.0.10
SOCKSPolicy accept 192.168.0.1/24
SOCKSPolicy reject *
orport 443
dirbindaddress 192.168.0.10:9001
dirport 80
dirbindaddress 192.168.0.10:9030
Do I even need the SOCKSpolicy settings?
On the other computers of the LAN, I'll setup browser to proxy to
192.168.0.10:8118 and have privoxy listening and configured
appropriately on the Tor server computer. I'll also have some
computers running locally socksified applications to

@_subject: randomness of Tor exit nodes 
Hi mw,
Just something to adjust your expectation. Remember that not all
servers exit for a given port. There is only a handful to 119 for
example and even less at a time for email related ports. Second, there
are many middleman nodes (130 or something) so subtract that from your
selection list. And last, once Tor chooses a circuit it will stick
with it for a certain time. This is from the Tor Wiki, notice the last
paragraph for example.
3.7. How often does Tor change its paths?
Tor will reuse the same circuit for new TCP streams for 10 minutes, as
long as the circuit is working fine. (If the circuit fails, Tor will
switch to a new circuit immediately.)
But note that a single TCP stream (e.g. a long IRC connection) will
stay on the same circuit forever -- we don't rotate individual streams
from one circuit to the next. Otherwise an adversary with a partial
view of the network would be given many chances over time to link you
to your destination, rather than just one chance.

@_subject: servers using netbios?? 
Hi phobos,
Yes, I did in fact. I unchecked them all except NetBIOS over TCP/IP. I
can't turn that off, otherwise I won't be able to share folders on my
LAN. It still happens occasionally, though. So you're saying this is
normal Windows behaviour, or is there something wrong with my DNS
I did a lot of researching on this subject only to find that DNS
resolving is a complicated thing, specially in a Windows environment.
My router does DNS relaying and I use a large HOSTS file. Maybe you
can point me to a reference where this specific situation is

@_subject: Tor 0.1.1.6-alpha is out 
Hi Bob,
The complete error message is:
Microsoft Visual C++ Debug Library
Debug Error!
Program: C:\Program Files\Tor\tor.exe
Module: C:\Program Files\Tor\tor.exe
Run-Time Check Failure  - Stack around the variable 'payload' was corrupted.
Press retry to debug the application
"Retry" will crash Tor.
I'm getting it too after installing the new tor-0.1.1.6-alpha-win32. I
reverted back to tor-0.1.1.5-alpha-win32 and started getting with it
as well! Now that's odd, I didn't have this before...
It doesn't happen immediately, maybe an hour after starting.

Hi alien,
I might have found the reason but I need to understand how the network
acknowledges that a Tor server has changed its IP. How soon will the
network realize this? Is it possible that due to some sort of lag the
network might think a server is sitting on the old IP when in fact it
has changed?
