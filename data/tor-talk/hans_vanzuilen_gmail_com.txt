@_subject: [tor-talk] JScript on/off 
Experiencing lot of speed up with JS='off'!
Of course annoying that media are pushing to have JS ='on' by simply
refusing a working display of content.
On the other hand, they forget that timesaving is more attractive than
I think keeping JS standard 'off' better sense. Requires only clear
communication to users, about impacts.
Using Tor is mainly braked by mediated leaks.
