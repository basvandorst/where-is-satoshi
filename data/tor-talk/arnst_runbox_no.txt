I'm using IMAPS over Tor for email purposes.  Sporadically I get
'password incorrect' errors which usually go away when I click 'Retry'.
 Is this some kind of MitM attack?

Yes, I thought not, but it's strange behavior nonetheless as it never
happens except over Tor with my provider, and it is always transient
(one, maybe two failed auths, then things work - it makes me suspicious).
Is this not sufficient to get BadExit flag?

That's what I was hoping! But after Flame and the novel MD5 break... one
can't be too paranoid I guess?
The strange thing is this only happens over Tor with my mail provider,
and it's not a timeout.  That's why I thought it was "funny"...
