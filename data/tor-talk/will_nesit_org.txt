@_subject: [tor-talk] Excito b3 Onionbox/etc/network/interfaces and 
we received one of the excito b3 onionboxes and were messing around with it last night
anyone have a copy of the default /etc/network/interfaces
one of my guys accidentally the file :/
we were trying to configure the excito box to running tor transparently for anyone who connects to the wifi interface
 trying to follow this but i think its missing some stuff
anyone go down this path already?
