@_subject: (FWD) Server on OS/X 
I've been running an alternating client/server for 4 months now on my
dual G5 without incident.  I've gone through probably three different
OSes in that time, 10.3.7-.9.   So far, I've not experienced any of the
problems you people seem to have with tor.  I've always run the latest
tor from cvs with privoxy from darwinports.  So specifically, that's
meant 0.1.0.1-rc, .2-rc, and a few .3-rc's as of late, i've been
building it once a week.
Maybe it's a G4 vs. G5 problem?  Some openssl altivec optimization that
the G4's don't like?

@_subject: performance tuning... 
While this isn't necessarily a fix for the problem, I noticed an extreme
performance improvement when I moved from my quad-xeon to a dual
opteron.  The opterons appear to handle the exact same bandwidth load at
1-2% cpu vs. the xeons averaging 40-50%.  I haven't run oprofile on the latest code, which is also running as
fully 64-bit, but I was very surprised by the difference between xeon
and opteron wrt tor performance.
I've run the old tor binaries from the xeon on the opteron as is, and
the performance improvement is the same.  This is regarding 0.1.0.1 and beyond.

@_subject: minimise to system tray 
I used this some more today.  Here's some more feedback:
1) When changing event levels in the Message Log, it appears to start
from the point where the levels changed, not merely filter according to
the new log levels.  Case in point, I had all selected Debug through
Error.  When unchecking Debug, I lost all log messages.
2) The bandwidth graph never shows numbers for Bytes Total, Bytes Read,
and Bytes Written.  I do see the graph update, and it appears to cover
the last 15 seconds of traffic.
This is the best app we have for systray at this point, and may possibly
warrant inclusion with the Win32 distro of tor in the future.
Good work overall.  It appears really stable and resource friendly.

A follow-up to this, since I noticed your mailer implies an Apple OS,
you could also get the source, inspect it, and follow the instructions
for "make dist-osx" to create your own mpkg which can be installed via
the Apple packaging system.  The "make dist-osx" setup is fairly trivial
to complete.  If you're skilled enough to read and understand the
source, and what it's actually doing, then chances are compiling the
code isn't that much of a mental stretch.

Most likely, it is you. :)
I'm unable to replicate this on 10.4.2 or 10.3.9 with 0.1.0.14.  What
user does your tor daemon run as?  In OSX, it's _tor by default, if that
doesn't have access to the /var/Process/ directory, it can't write to
it.  In your example, is _tor(or whatever user you run it as) a member
of devgrp?

@_subject: servers using netbios?? 
In your config, do you have either of these options checked:
TCP/IP -> Advanced -> DNS -> Register this connection's address in DNS
TCP/IP -> Advanced -> WINS -> Enabled LMHOSTS lookup AND for NetBIOS
settings: Default or Enable
If so, uncheck "Register this connection's address in DNS" because the
root servers don't care about your dns entry.  And if you have LMHOSTS
and/or NetBIOS over TCPIP, Windows will do some "window's name
resolution" which is over UDP on ports 135-139.

I'll try your way at some point to see what it does for fun.  However,
on a clean install, can you capture all output during the entire phase
and see if the build reports any errors.  I can hypothesize some situations that may create this, but for the most
part, I'm at a loss to explain why.

I've played with this a bit tonight, here are my comments:
1) It's great and appears to work as I'd expect.
2) The installer should assume the default path and prompt for yes/no
from the user, esp if the tor.exe can't be found in the default path.
3) If the torrc doesn't have the control service enabled, it should
either do it for the user, or bring up the config file in
notepad/wordpad/default editor
4) there should be a readme file or something that pops up after
installation to explain basic usage.  What further testing do you think it needs to leave beta stage?  It
seems to work real well in my short testing period.

I haven't seen this behavior under Tiger.  Did anything go wrong during
the install of Tor + Privoxy?  Have you upgraded to Tiger or fresh
format and install?
Either way, it sounds like the install of Tor+Privoxy is broken in
various ways.  Perhaps a re-install off a fresh DMG?

It'd also be great if these had enough cpu power to be a server

card is decent, but not sure that could be included in the price of the
hardware and still keep it cheap enough.

@_subject: os x kernel panics 
I've been doing some digging into the loose correlation of tor and osx
kernel panics.  So far, it only happens on 10.3.x; that I know of.  If
anyone has panic.log's they'd like to send me, i'm trying to get a feel
for what's going on. The bulk of the work happens at kernel panic when I can do a remote gdb
to the machine and figure out what the backtrace is telling me.  One interesting thing I noted was that on my 8 panics as recorded in
panic.log, the last 3 have the same memory addresses of the stack
pointer where the call was initiated (lr).  In theory, the way apple
handles kernel modules and loading, this shouldn't happen.  Anyway, if you've experienced an osx kernel panic, could you send me:
1) your latest kernel panic info from the log file
2) which version of tor you are running
3) which install you did (fink, darwinports, package from the tor website, or source compile)
I believe this may be a dual bug, one in apple's kernel for allowing a
userland program to cause a panic, and two, something in tor or a
dependent lib creating the condition to cause the first bug.  As far as
I can loosely correlate, it appears to happen when a circuit times out
and a new one is created.  This may cause the 0x300 DAR panic, as you
try to dereference freed memory.  In theory, this should only crash
tor, not the kernel.

I did some research, panther does indeed have kqueue().  Java and
Filesystem use it on 10.3.x.  There isn't much on Apple's dev website
about it, but it is in 10.3.x.  I believe it may be internal only, but
this is just based upon the fact that i can't find any dev docs that say
use kqueue(). One reference:

Vidalia seems to assume that the local user is running
Tor and that Vidalia has full control of Tor.  This works well on
Windows, but not unix-like OSes (osx/linux/unix) where Tor is installed
as a separate user and provides ControlPort access via a tcp port.
I'm open to changing the installer, but I'd prefer Vidalia to check for
existing port 9051 (or whatever port is configured) first.
Perhaps the Vidalia people will respond.

@_subject: OSX Improvements for Tor+Privoxy Bundle 
There are three improvements in the current cvs branch (0.1.1.16-rc)
of Tor for OSX.  They are: 1) an uninstallation script for the bundle;
2) full PDF documentation included in the final installation; and 3) a
pretty installer.  Please try them out.  I welcome feedback.
1.  There now exists an un-install script for OSX Tiger and Panther.  For
now, it is included in the current branch (0.1.1.16-rc) of Tor.  It is
installed, by default, to /Library/Tor/ as a file named:
Running this shell script should completely un-install the Tor+Privoxy
Bundle and remove all associated directories. It does not backup any
files. It merely removes the bundle and the appropriate Tor and
Privoxy directories.
Also, included is an AppleScript stub for a future "point and click"
uninstaller.  This is named Tor_Uninstaller.applescript.  It, too, is
installed in the default /Library/Tor directory.
2.  There are now full documents included with the OSX Tor+Privoxy
Bundle.  These documents are now placed in the directory 3.  The Tor+Privoxy Bundle installation windows are now decorated with
the Tor logo as produced by Ren of the EFF.

The resulting rpm file will include the target cpu name in the rpm file.
Case in point, if you set "target_cpu=athlon", your resulting filename
may look like tor-version-release.athlon.rpm.  Previously, all rpms
would have been named i686.rpm even if the binaries are for non-i686
This and other changes are documented in doc/tor-rpm-creation.txt.

will ask the OS for as many file descriptors as the OS will allow (you
can find this by "ulimit -H -n"). If this number is  less  than  ConnLimit,  then
Tor  will refuse to start.

It sounds like what you really want is to install the OSX tor package
for experts and then install vidalia afterwards.  One difference between
the Tor package for experts and the vidalia bundle is how Tor and
Privoxy are handled at the system level.  The tor package for experts
assumes you want Tor and Privoxy to start at system boot and be
available for all users.  The Vidalia package assumes you want to start
Tor via Vidalia.  The latter leaves privoxy to start with the system.
Someday, we'll have Vidalia controlling privoxy or polipo and Tor from
the gui.

The "experts" package does indeed start up Tor and Privoxy on boot.  I tested this last night for 10.4.11 successfully.  In fact, I'm unable to make them fail to start on boot without forcefully injecting an invalid config.  Technically, the OS does try to start Tor, but my forced invalid config causes it to fail to start.

In my practical experience, amd athlon64/opterons seem to handle tor

Hardly.  Tor can be difficult to correctly configure for fantastic

I can confidently state that arguing about mailing list etiquette
is a futile pursuit.  As someone who lived through "The Day" when AOLers
were given usenet access in 1994, I understand the breaking of
etiquette.  However, arguing about etiquette shouldn't take priority
over helping others on or-talk.
As someone who lives in the world of unicode by day, stating that
everyone should use ascii seems archaic to me.  Using plaintext over
html or rich text, great; we agree on this point.
Tor is used, supported, and maintained by an international group of
volunteers.  They don't always converse in English, nor do a subset even
know how to do so.  I know from working with Farsi speakers, their
English is far superior to my Farsi.  I make horribly offensive mistakes
when trying to converse in Farsi; the recipients merely correct or
switch to English in order to converse.  Trying to make non-native
English speakers understand fairly esoteric etiquette rules is
difficult.  A little understanding about different customs is all that
is needed.  I'm willing to forgive mistakes so long as the signal far
exceeds the noise.

I believe pidgin won't leak your dns requests if you use socks 5 on port
9050 through tor directly.   At least, my version of 2.4.1 doesn't leak
dns requests with this configuration.

: Proxomitron gives me more filtering of scripts, etc than prvixy.
If you use torbutton with firefox, it won't leak dns requests anyway.
If not using torbutton, you should make sure

: 3) Should I change from privoxy to polipo? I am a windows xp user.
This is up to you.  polipo for windows is still a work in progress,

This is a FAQ answer,

In the manual page, there is:
ConnLimit NUM
 The minimum number of file descriptors that must be available to the
Tor process before it will start. Tor will ask the OS for as many file
descriptors as the OS will allow (you can find this by "ulimit -H -n").
If this number is less than ConnLimit, then Tor will refuse to start.  You probably don't need to adjust this. It has no effect on Windows
since that platform lacks getrlimit(). (Default: 1000)
This may or may not work to fix the problems with a poorly designed ADSL
router.  As for the design questions, I'll let someone else answer that as I

I really doubt the politicians know the difference between TCP and UDP.

@_subject: Tor 0.2.0.32 is released 
Tor 0.2.0.32 fixes a major security problem in Debian and Ubuntu packages
(and maybe other packages) noticed by Theo de Raadt, fixes a smaller
security flaw that might allow an attacker to access local services,
further improves hidden service performance, and fixes a variety of
other issues.
Or use our new  page.
Changes in version 0.2.0.32 - 2008-11-20
  o Security fixes:
    - The "User" and "Group" config options did not clear the
      supplementary group entries for the Tor process. The "User" option
      is now more robust, and we now set the groups to the specified
      user's primary group. The "Group" option is now ignored. For more
      detailed logging on credential switching, set CREDENTIAL_LOG_LEVEL
      in common/compat.c to LOG_NOTICE or higher. Patch by Jacob Appelbaum
      and Steven Murdoch. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre14. Fixes bug 848 and 857.
    - The "ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses" config option wasn't being
      consistently obeyed: if an exit relay refuses a stream because its
      exit policy doesn't allow it, we would remember what IP address
      the relay said the destination address resolves to, even if it's
      an internal IP address. Bugfix on 0.2.0.7-alpha; patch by rovv.
  o Major bugfixes:
    - Fix a DOS opportunity during the voting signature collection process
      at directory authorities. Spotted by rovv. Bugfix on 0.2.0.x.
  o Major bugfixes (hidden services):
    - When fetching v0 and v2 rendezvous service descriptors in parallel,
      we were failing the whole hidden service request when the v0
      descriptor fetch fails, even if the v2 fetch is still pending and
      might succeed. Similarly, if the last v2 fetch fails, we were
      failing the whole hidden service request even if a v0 fetch is
      still pending. Fixes bug 814. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
    - When extending a circuit to a hidden service directory to upload a
      rendezvous descriptor using a BEGIN_DIR cell, almost 1/6 of all
      requests failed, because the router descriptor has not been
      downloaded yet. In these cases, do not attempt to upload the
      rendezvous descriptor, but wait until the router descriptor is
      downloaded and retry. Likewise, do not attempt to fetch a rendezvous
      descriptor from a hidden service directory for which the router
      descriptor has not yet been downloaded. Fixes bug 767. Bugfix
      on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Fix several infrequent memory leaks spotted by Coverity.
    - When testing for libevent functions, set the LDFLAGS variable
      correctly. Found by Riastradh.
    - Avoid a bug where the FastFirstHopPK 0 option would keep Tor from
      bootstrapping with tunneled directory connections. Bugfix on
      0.1.2.5-alpha. Fixes bug 797. Found by Erwin Lam.
    - When asked to connect to A.B.exit:80, if we don't know the IP for A
      and we know that server B rejects most-but-not all connections to
      port 80, we would previously reject the connection. Now, we assume
      the user knows what they were asking for. Fixes bug 752. Bugfix
      on 0.0.9rc5. Diagnosed by BarkerJr.
    - If we overrun our per-second write limits a little, count this as
      having used up our write allocation for the second, and choke
      outgoing directory writes. Previously, we had only counted this when
      we had met our limits precisely. Fixes bug 824. Patch from by rovv.
      Bugfix on 0.2.0.x.
    - Remove the old v2 directory authority 'lefkada' from the default
      list. It has been gone for many months.
    - Stop doing unaligned memory access that generated bus errors on
      sparc64. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha. Fixes bug 862.
    - Make USR2 log-level switch take effect immediately. Bugfix on
      0.1.2.8-beta.
  o Minor bugfixes (controller):
    - Make DNS resolved events into "CLOSED", not "FAILED". Bugfix on
      0.1.2.5-alpha. Fix by Robert Hogan. Resolves bug 807.

@_subject: Tor 0.2.0.32 is released 
For OS X users, there is a packaging bugfix in 0.2.0.32 labelled as
0.2.0.32a in the available packages.  It turns out for years we've been
shipping a Info.plist with an incorrect key.  The issue was discovered
and reported as bug 876,
   The commit to fix the problem in the 0_2_0 branch is r17472:
The commit to fix the problem in the Vidalia 0.1 branch is r3361:
The bug is that the OS X Installer will prompt "The chosen volume
contains software which is newer then [sic] the software you are
The problem is that the Installer looks in the file CFBundleShortVersionString.  We mistakenly called it
CFBundleSortVersionString, which Apple inserts "1" as the value.  The
upgrade to Vidalia from 0.1.9 to 0.1.10 apparently triggered the issue.  The fix is to put the correct value in place for the future.  The
simplest way to do this is to have the users click "Continue" when
prompted.  We could have spent a lot of time trying to fix it for the
user to hide the issue, but well, that is fraught with problems and
complexities.  A simple click of "Continue" is far simpler and less
error prone.   The difference between the released 0.2.0.32 Tor code is the inclusion
of r17472.  It's not really 0.2.0.32a per se, but since we lack package
versions, I had to distinguish it in some way.

A few things,  you probably haven't received a response because no one
has a good idea how to fix it.  You may have 2 issues, one is that
libevent can't find nameservers, and the other is that the config
options are broken.

For the config issues, which may be related to the dns issues, do you
have a copy of the torrc that's generated by Vidalia?

attacks on firefox, it would be interesting to see if it is against
Firefox through Tor, firefox with torbutton 1.0.4, or firefox with the
current development version of torbutton (1.2.0rc2).  This thought comes from the DOM

I'm not sure what this means exactly.  I don't see what Xerobank could
gain from devaluing the software they rely upon for their product.  If
such an exploit existed, and can be presented at Defcon, chances are
it's not a difficult exploit, or isn't against the Tor network, but
rather a research network.  Again, we have no information to go on, so
I'm just speculating.  For all I know, they put a banana peel on the
floor for Roger to slip on.
If we tie it back to the Firefox DOM link, well, it could be a firefox
exploit that can decrease your anonymity.  Java, Flash, etc can expose
you, too.

: : This would seem to be a bug, yes? If people leave "Torbutton" checked

I think I've fixed this in r14238 and r14239 commits.  I'm not sure the fix
is much better from a user experience perspective.  What happens is
the user will notice firefox start up and prompt to install
torbutton-version.xpi.  This method appears to be the "correct" way to
install and upgrade extensions per profile.  The list of potential
issues with this new way is:
1) If the user has multiple profiles, only the profile set as default
will be prompted to install the bundled torbutton;
2) Users may wonder why they are being asked to install an extension in
firefox, when all they checked was "torbutton" in the Vidalia/Tor
3) Users may have the same concern as  but never even realize
torbutton is checked by default; and finally,
4) Users may cancel the installation and not realize torbutton is not
installed.  This is the "hey, tor is just as fast as my normal internet
connection" issue.
Previously, we used the --install-global-extension option on the command
line.  The drawbacks to this were the lack of overwriting existing
extensions of the same name, and all users and all profiles had
torbutton installed for them; whether they wanted it or not.
I'm open to other ideas as to how to do this.  I tried manually
installing torbutton for them by reverse engineering the mozilla
extension installation process.  My reverse engineering was probably not
complete, as this method was problematic.
The other part that changed in r14238/9 is that osx users no longer have
Vidalia set to start on login automatically.  This is because the
installer runs as root via sudo, and the proper command, "defaults",
won't run correctly in a sudo shell.  The fix for this may be to install
the vidalia bundle into $HOME and not assume people use OSX like a
multi-user unix system, but rather each user runs their own tor/vidalia
setup.  Of course, if two or more people use the same OSX system, the
first one to startup vidalia/tor wins. The second, and subsequent, users
will receive errors indicating the Tor ports are already taken.
I'm open to suggestions, and patches to Vidalia's pkg/osx/TorPostflight
and pkg/win32/vidalia-bundle.nsi.in to arrive at a better solution.

After install, it should just work once you start Vidalia.    You do
manage to talk to other nodes because you get enough info to build
circuits.  When you look in Vidalia's Network Map, do you see yellow lines on the map of the world?  In the window below the world map, do
you see connections with Status of "Open"?

I haven't tested the latest 9.5x releases of Opera, but previously

These are called chilling effects.  Rather than directly attack
something, you create an environment that discourages its existence. I run an exit node with the default policy.  I, too, deal with the abuse
complaints and DMCA take down notices.  A couple of emails with copy and
pasted responses to these things is worth it for me to provide the
service for others.  I've even been known to get on the phone and talk
to people.  Smart ISPs realize they aren't at risk from Tor nodes.
Having an intelligent email, showing them
 and
 are more than most
care to investigate.  After 5 years, my node is still online. A while ago, someone on or-talk said that 20% of their traffic was
"illegal" in their opinion.  My first thought was, "wow, 80% of the
traffic is people like me using Tor."  The vast majority of Tor users
are normal people doing normal things.  Much like the larger Internet,
bad people exist and will attempt to exploit something for their gain.
That's life.  The overall usage and existence of Tor is a great thing.
Normal people use Tor,   I believe the legal risks to Tor in the USA are low, given the safe
harbor provisions of the DMCA; which covers Tor and the ISP.  Other
countries, such as Germany, the UK, and possibly Australia, have possible
risks approaching.  As Roger states,
 Tor
is trying to figure out next steps.  More help here would be great.

The Tor Browser Bundle is produced by the Tor Project itself.  It's more
than a compilation of software designed to be portable.  One of the
threat models it defends against is that of a user at an internet cafe in
a heavily censored country.  The user risks bad things happening to them
if they are found to be bypassing the censorship.  Much research went into
creating TBB, such that it works in a self-contained, anonymity-preserving
way.  There are many ways for the operating system to divulge that TBB
was run, what was cached, and otherwise provide a fingerprint that can
be tracked.  We mitigate these leaks.  There are still more to correct,
Our modifications to the software in TBB are freely available,

It's not a scheduled outage.  The machine that hosts it is slowly
failing in interesting ways.  It's back online and the geoip lookups are
working again.

That's what it is supposed to say until you give it a name.  The
assumption is that you use out of band methods to authenticate the cert
is correctly assigned.  And then you type whatever nickname you want to
give it into the petname field.  Should the slo-tech.com cert change,
you'll receive a red box instead of green.

@_subject: Tutorials for providing Hidden Services? 
: I want to provide basic free anonymous blogging services using Tor's hidden services. Are there any tutorials for this, apart from the basic setup information on Torproject.org? More specifically, how can I stop my users from identifying my server? What do I have to pay attention to?
There is no tutorial that I know of.  Each piece of software has
different concerns and configurations to protect both your and your
users anonymity.  : How can I block connection attempts by Apache using my external network interface, eg. if the users execute scripts that contact external addresses? What information is exposed by environment variables, and how can I stop the user from reading them? For example, can I modify timezone/timestamps to obfuscate my server location?
Just some thoughts.  Run apache on localhost.  Set the system time to UTC.
Check the 404 page and such so that it doesn't give out the hostname.
Run apache in a jail, etc.  Run the jail/vm on a system without a public
IP; such that if someone does break apache, they find the IP address is
192.168.1.2 (or some other RFC1918 scheme).
: What settings do I have to change to fully remove Apache's IP logging to protect my users?
Disable access logging.

Great, we welcome your interest.  You probably want to
familiarize yourself with how the bundle for Windows is created,
   Perhaps getting TBB
working on any one linux is 80% of the effort to getting it to work on
all linuxes.
You might find Section 7.2 of the three-year roadmap,
has some more ideas.
There are some common questions to tackle as part of creating a
TBB for linux:
- Is it safe to link tor, vidlia, pidgin, or polipo to dynamic libraries
  on the OS?  Is it safe to assume that some of these libraries are
  available on all target linuxes (such as openssl, qt4, libz, libevent,
  etc)?
- Can one compile tor, vidalia, pidgin, and polipo without linking to dynamic
  libraries?
- Are there functions that if Vidalia could do, would make running all
  of this easier?  For instance, should vidalia control polipo
stop/start much like it can control Tor now?
- What traces are left behind after running TBB on linux?  We have
  completed some analysis of this for Windows,
  The
next step is to not only document the traces, if any, but suggest or
code fixes for leaving no trace behind.

To clarify, were you raided because you ran a Tor node or because your
IP address showed up in a website logfile (which was collected by the
police during their anti-child porn sweep)?

Tor isn't illegal, spreading child porn is.  If they raided you because
you ran Tor, whether or not child porn supposedly went through it or
not, that's a big deal.  It's like being raided because I use full
disk encryption.  There are lots of tor nodes in germany, for example.

The command "pmap" may also work,
It gives you a handy total at the end of its output.
Alternatively, just parse /proc/{tor pid}/status for the details.

You should have the file in the bundle already.  Depending upon your OS,
you may need to apt-get install tor-geoipdb as well.

@_subject: more on the Comcast 250 GB/mo. problem 
: There's not much point running Tor on capped residential broadband.
: Rent a server with a decent traffic plan and throttle your Tor so
: you're within limits.
Actually, there is value to running a Tor server on residential
broadband.  Most tcp internet usage doesn't need huge amounts of
bandwidth; such as instant messaging, email, newsgroups, rss, etc.  I'd argue
that most web browsing doesn't need huge amounts either, on average.  In
bursts, yes, you want the page to download so you can start reading it.
I know there is research out there about this topic.
It's not a competition to see who can run the highest bandwidth node.
Although, I wonder if there is an incentive in there to publish the 10
highest bandwidth nodes; ala
  And if this would result
in a higher quantity of high bandwidth nodes available to Tor.
I've run a few 20KB Tor nodes over the years, and they do just fine
consuming 20KB all the time. It's not like they're shunned for lack of
bandwidth. From my own experiences, my IM, RSS, and email usage ends up
with lots of 20KB nodes in the circuit.  The apps do just fine, and I
never noticed any performance loss.
1,000 20KB tor nodes on disparate residential networks vs. 10 2000KB
nodes is the same amount of bandwidth to Tor clients, and they'll use it
quite well. The fact that you run an exit relay, or any relay, is great.  I long for the day where I own the last mile and ISPs compete on
services and pricing to get access to it.  Or, give me 100 mb wireless
at sane prices since you don't have to deal with so much physical last
mile runs.

@_subject: Abuse ticket 
: Im running Tor on VPS and I have some problems with abusive Tor traffic.
In five years of running a node, I had my share of these too.  From
abusive forum posts to stupid people trying to break into .mil sites.  I
probably had 1 abuse complaint for every 10 TB of traffic served through
Tor.  That's a pretty good ratio of good vs. bad.  In most cases, I asked the ISP to let me directly contact the person
reporting the abuse and sent a completed dmca reponse based on the
EFF DMCA template, a link to the Tor abuse faq, and an explanation why
even banning all of Tor will do no good to stop abuse.  Jerks who want
to abuse someone will do it regardless of tor; they can use any number
of open proxies, any number of vpn providers, use a friend's computer,
etc.  I always said to the abuse reporter that if they felt the need to ban,
at least make it temporary.  Banning a huge swath of IP space for one
abusive post is just stupid.  If you're going to be stupid like that,
at least be temporarily stupid.  Eventually, the forum admin will ban
so much IP space their forum traffic will suffer.

@_subject: Abuse ticket 
The abuse was a web forum post or some ssh attempts.  In nearly all
cases it was hundreds of KB vs 10TB of non-complaint generating traffic.
Right.  As a node operator, I don't record the traffic so I have no idea
what's good or bad, just what generates complaints.  And what's good or
bad to me may not be classified the same by others.  So fine, a few
hundred KB of complaint traffic vs. 10TB of non-complaint traffic is
still a fine ratio. That's a better ratio than my smtp gateway records;
it's at 1:1 spam/complaint vs. real email.
Criminals have vastly more opportunities to hide their traffic than
just using Tor.  They're already willing to break the laws, most normal
people aren't.  I've talked to victims of domestic abuse and targets of
e-stalkers, who even after everything they've endured, won't break the
laws.  They won't break the laws even when it's in their best interest
to be safe.  Criminals will always abuse a system for their own gains
and move on to the next thing.  What you propose is an interesting research project, assuming one can
define "criminal traffic".
