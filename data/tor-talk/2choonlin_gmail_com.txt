No problem with Mozilla, or Chrome before last night. Access to the

@_subject: [tor-talk] browser with best privacy without using the Tor 
I am looking for such a solution too. On Windows, you can use portable
Firefox and install the extensions. On GNU, I realize the only
available portable Firefox is the tbb package and I have to use it by
waiting for tor to start, which is a waste of time. I wish there is a
portable version of Firefox for GNU.

Do you mean the ZIP version of Firefox nightly? Even though not
installation is needed, those are not really portable as they leave
files on the home directory.
What I am looking is a version of Portable Firefox
( that run on GNU. So far, my search revealed
tbb as I believe the tor project modeled it after Portable Firefox.

Is it just me, I realized when I deployed the latest tbb 2.2.35-3 on
Vista machines, the control buttons (minimized, enlarge and close) are
not seen but available. The portion is just a black bar and I can
click on the portion where I would have to guess it's function, eg.
right most is close it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB on GNU and Windows 
I realized that the tbb is behaving differently on GNU and Windows. In
Windows, one may start tbb before or after starting an instance of
Mozilla Firefox. In GNU, one may start tbb only after opening Firefox
first. If tbb is started and I attempt to start a fresh instance of
Firefox, it will launch another window of tbb.
Is this difference intentional?

Each time after running TBB on GNU/Linux, I found 5 items (all
folders) in the Trash folder. I would like to ask if this is normal
behavior. If yes, why are they not removed permanently and instead,
moved to Trash?
1. defaults
2. plugins
3. tmp

Second that. I faced this situation 2 days ago with Ubuntu 11.10 and
TBB 2.2.33.3 and I was wondering if the OS was the problem since TBB
was working beforehand.
I also notice that vadalia control panel is not closing itself after I
have closed the browser. Another bug?

I note that for previous versions of the TBB, all plugins installed on

release shows all the plugins (eg. Java, Flash, etc..) with an option
to enable them as they are currently disabled by default.

You can use the software macchanger and script it to have different
MAC address each time you boot up.
Most networks are running DHCP and thus this is unlikely to affect
your computing.

The tor browser for GNU (2.2.32.4) has stopped working on Ubuntu 11.10
after updating some packages today. It was working before that.
CLI shows "Qt: Session management error: None of the authentication
protocols specified are supported"
GUI shows "Vadalia was unable to connect to Tor. (Socket operation timed out.)"
Anyone has this problem too?

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB and Portable Firefox 
I have been searching for a Firefox version for GNU/Linux that is
portable aka portable apps. I note that TBB leaves no data after usage
and I have been using it as my portable browser full time with Tor
disabled. However, I have to wait for quite some time for Tor and
Vidalia to load each time I wish to use it, including choosing to
disable Tor. Thus, I would like to ask if its possible to extract TBB,
copy out this folder
and run ./firefox from the folder. Would this Firefox be portable, ie.
no data remains after usage?

I would like to ask for members of this list about the following statement:
"The authorities in Singapore are understood to have the ability to
track down a person online even if he or she uses anonymizing
facilities such as Virtual Private Networking, TOR onion routing, or
other forms of proxy servers, and even if encryption is involved. This
is because all internet traffic in Singapore is directed through a

I was the one who reported the "Invalid Server Certificate" last month.
After some experimenting with some platforms, I realized this error
affects Windows XP/Chromium but not other OSes (I did not try any
Server edition). As you can read from my posting in the above link,
other browsers seems to be coping fine, even though the certificate
loaded are identical.
Same build Chromium on different platform reported no error. I
conclude the OS is the problem.

Aurora is a brand-less version of Firefox. It is considered to be more

Portable app is a method of modifying a product (Firefox) into one
