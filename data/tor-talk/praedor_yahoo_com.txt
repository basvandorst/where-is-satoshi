I had horrible troubles getting the latest tor 0.2.1.7 working after upgrading.  I use Tork, not Vidalia, but I suspect the problem is likely the I deleted my existing tor directory (in linux, that is in /home//.tor - I have no idea if there is an equivalent windows setup to this - the directory that contains your tor configuration file) and started tor up again and it worked fine.  I then had to manually edit the config file to add my server name, contact info, etc.  Since then, it has worked.

@_subject: Tork - all tor versions lead to 0.2.1.7-alpha? 
I am wondering if anyone knows why Tork (0.29.2) seeks to download tor-0.2.1.7-alpha regardless of whether one asks it to check for the latest "stable" tor instead of the latest "experimental" tor.  I see that the latest STABLE tor release appears to be 0.2.0.32, not 0.2.1.7-alpha.
What gives?

OK, and thanks...I posted here because I was wondering if the two tors had merged (development and stable) for the moment or if there was something I was unaware of in tor world (perhaps a fork or a weird new naming convention).

I had been connecting to the irc.freenode.org server but recently, while running tor I am no longer allowed to connect even though I am not trying to connect anonymously with tor.  I know there are a couple hidden service versions for freenode but neither of them work for me either.  I enter their *.onion address and my client (Kopete) SEES them but it never actually succeeds in connecting.  I get:

The other freenode hidden service is authenticated by pgp key but I cannot connect to that because I would first have to connect to the regular server, or the non-authenticated hidden service above to generate a hash, etc.  What is it about running tor, even as a relay, that prevents me from connecting at all to freenode?

I erred.  I am no longer using 0.2.1.7.  I had to give up because I could not get it working properly.  Doing what I mention below allowed me to run tor via Vidalia but not via Tork (my preferred tor manager).  There was an issue with the config file that I could never figure out so I went back to a previous version of tor that worked (currently that is 0.2.0.31.
Don't think I will mess with 0.2.1.7 again.  Since you use Vidalia, you might manage to get it working more than temporarily.

@_subject: Tried one last time, giving up on 0.2.1.7-alpha 
I went ahead and tried to use tor-0.2.1.7 again and again it has failed without any debug information or error messages or anything else to explain why it refuses to run.
If I totally delete my ~/.tor directory and start tor from the CLI, it will start and run for a little while (say less than a minute) and then just quit.  If I then try to start it again, it is an IMMEDIATE fail without any messages to explain why.  Using Tork, I use the First Run Wizard to try to get tor and tork setup and then hit the "start tor" button.  It starts out as if it is going to work, usually doing the "bootstrapping" thing until about 90%, then POOF, no more tor and any attempt to start it again immediately fails. Can someone please supply me with a torrc file that actually works with 0.2.1.7-alpha (with your own personal settings altered) so I can try that?  The torrc.sample that comes with the 0.2.1.7 install doesn't work when I try to manually edit it instead of using Tork.

@_subject: More info on my own tor problems 
I have had a long-running problem upgrading to tor-0.2.1.7-alpha.  I usually use Tork as my tor manager (version 0.29.2 rpm - I can't build the latest because I am using kde 4 and it wont build on such a system) and run the configuation wizard after every tor upgrade.  This has worked perfectly up until 0.2.1.7-alpha.  The problem is that no matter what I do, be it configure tor via Tork or do it manually with a text editor, I cannot get tor to run.  It crashes very quickly and, from Tork, produces no useful log information.  It just stops.
I have now tried with vidalia and I am still unable to run tor but I am getting useful log data:

I have no idea what the problem is with the torrc file.  I merely took the sample provided with the software and uncommented the applicable parts (after Tork failed to configure it) and copy it to torrc.  What is the deal with tor-0.2.1.7?  What has changed vis a vis configuration that appears to break it compared to the any and all of the previous versions?  Most important of all, how do I get past this so I can start running tor again?

A couple things:  such KNOWN and set boxes would be subject to taps (probably wouldn't matter much if they are relays but it becomes a potential problem if they are exits).
Second, I believe (correct if wrong) that if you, a private citizen, are donating your system for use as a relay/tor server you have no real or even potential legal "obligation" to keep logs for presentation to authorities when they ask for them (with a bogus non-warrant FBI "National Security Letter" for instance).  If you are now a fee-for-use entity (basically commercial) you are potentially subject to such nonsense.
The point of tor isn't to lock people out by charging for service, it is to act as a totally open access system for ALL people regardless of economic status.  Charging locks out a lot of people, especially in foreign countries with naughty governments and shitty economic situations.

I can look but don't think that could be the issue.  I don't start tor as a service when I boot, I manually start it (via Tork or Vidalia).  If I don't start tor up via script in the rc directories, how could such a script have any effect on tor started on command?

That point was just an extra.  The major problem would be, as others chimed in about too, that you (person charging) would be royally screwed when the Feds decide to go on a witch hunt.  You (the potential person charging for service) and all your paying customers would be, as stated previously, on the short list for investigation.  You would definitely go on a watch list.

For the second day now I have been successful (finally) at operating tor-0.2.1.7-alpha via Tork (0.29.2).
The "fix" for me was to manually edit the torrc.sample and save it as torrc in link them all to the base torrc I placed in /etc/tor.  After doing this, I was still unable to start tor so I deleted my ~/.tor directory and tried again by starting it from the CLI.  This did get tor started and it ran for a while until I killed it.  I was then able to start tor from Tork and it remained stable.  This morning I started it again from Tork and it is (so far) still Up to this point, neither Tork nor Vidalia was able to configure or run tor.

This is driving me nuts.  I have repeatedly tried to upgrade to the latest tor with no success.  If I build and install it without doing any configuration, it will run with the builtin defaults (including the default server name) but if I try to create a torrc file, no matter what I do with it (using torrc.sample as a template) tor fails to run.  No error messages at all. What the hell is it with the latest tor and its config file?  Did something drastic change?  Why is the torrc.sample unusable as a simple template?  I've tried simply uncommenting a few of the basic settings (ORPort, etc) and changing the server name but this alone is enough to prevent tor from running.
For now it looks like I'm back to tor-0.2.1.6-alpha AGAIN.

Here's the torrc as it now stands.  I thought I managed to get it working because it started up and had bootstrapped a circuit and was then Self-

 Replace this with "SocksPort 0" if you plan to run Tor only as a

Now I'm really lost on this.  Tor quit running (I cannot run tor-0.2.1.7-alpha for more than a couple minutes, so it seems.  It just suddenly quits without any errors.  It's running then suddenly it isn't.
Looks like it is back to the previous version again...
That said, tor is down/off and I STILL get the same messages for my IRC client.  It seems that simply running tor briefly is enough to bork my IRC client from then on (at least until I reboot)?

@_subject: Problems with irc because of tor? 
I am running Mandriva linux 2009.0.  I have been using tork (as a tor manager) and tor for several years with a bunch of problems only occurring since going to 2009.0 AND upgrading to tor 0.2.1.7-alpha.  Before this, I ran tor and tork AND access IRC (via Konversation in KDE) without problems.  I've checked processes when tor appears to die and it really is dead.  I check the debug log and there is literally nothing there to indicate any problems whatsoever, just a message that tor died:

I have now uninstalled (again) tor-0.2.1.7-alpha and installed the 2009.0 package for tor instead, tor-0.2.0.31, and it is (and has been) working without hitch since I started it.  There appears to be something about 0.2.1.7 specifically that causes problems.  Prior to upgrading to it I was running tor-0.2.1.6, also without problem.

I run a relay server only.  Never an exit (at least, not for about a year) I keep seeing the "127.0.0.1 banned" message and wonder where this address is coming from to be mispresented to any outside server or computer.  Why is my REAL IP address be sidestepped and my localhost overriding it?  I am wondering if there is a tor configuration setting I am missing to prevent tor from "presenting" 127.0.0.1 as my address.

In any case, I would run my servers regardless of their AUP.  NO ONE tells me I cannot run sshd or any other of what I consider personally critical apps.  They also don't get to tell me not to run a tor relay.

Bit of a problem there (with long text lines).  If I want to be able to send http links to friends/
colleagues/family, I have to turn off the new line feature in my email client and allow end-user
email clients deal with formatting (all too often, if you have auto-formatting/new lines setup,
you will totally bork http links).  What client are you using that is causing a problem?  Mutt?

As a relay, it would be quite easy to never ever see full utilization.  The main limiting factor would be entry nodes, or more likely, exit nodes.  The number of exit nodes are MUCH lower than the number of relays so while your system may see little traffic, the exit nodes could easily be maxed out.

I'm with Bennett on this.  Taking away ExcludeNodes is essentially taking power and choice from tor users.
Always always always default towards providing more choice and power to users, not less.  In any case, as indicated, reporting bad nodes is not exclusive of ExcludeNodes.  ExcludeNodes is effective immediately.  Reporting a bad node takes time for a response.  Allow us to exclude the nodes we wish to exclude NOW, not after some period of time after reporting for something to be done.

@_subject: Time Warner bad / VPS recommendations 
I've sometimes wondered about the whether it would be possible to alter tor a bit, or place another app between tor and the net (perl script or something) that would work with a tor exit.  In cases where someone would like to run a tor exit node but gets into trouble with their ISP, might it be possible to add a script that might take at least the web traffic from a tor exit node in question and package it up and send it to anonymizer or kaxy or some other web anonymity proxy on the net?  It would be equivalent to adding a 4th, external node to the 3 official tor nodes...
This is a variation of a way I have considered for doing some extra anonymizing:  use tor to connect to a web anonymizing proxy and browse from there.
It would offload complaints about "inappropriate" acts by tor users away from the exit node and to the anonymizer service, which I am sure can take it because it is what they DO.

This is getting annoying to point of wanting to simply drop tor.
As of this morning I had been running tor-0.2.0.32 through Tork 0.29.2 without hitch (Mandriva linux 2009.0).  Any time I have tried to progress to anything beyond this version I run into the same problem every time:  tor will either not run or, more likely, will run for some period of time and then simply stop without any error messages to explain the termination. This morning, I decided to give tor-0.2.1.11-alpha a try.  Built and installed just fine and started up just fine.  It was running for at least several hours without hitch but then I had to leave for a meeting.  I'm gone for 2 1/2 hours only to come back and find that tor has stopped without so much as a single message anywhere on the system.  Nothing in the tork logs either.
What the heck is going on?

I have periodically been blocked from freenode (and then run into problems when trying to use the freenode onion service).  This has usually happened when/if I run tor, even briefly, as an exit node.  Freenode (and others) checks the exit node list and if it sees your IP there, you are blocked from normal access.  To regain normal access, you have to ensure you are not running a tor exit AND you need to contact the freenode operators and request you be unblocked, explaining that you are not running (or are no longer running) a tor exit

@_date: 2009-01-05 12:19:28
@_author: Praedor Atrebates 
@_subject: another tor issue...? (irc...) 
I rather suspect that you are not going to be able to resolve the issue so long as you run an exit.  It doesn't matter what sort of traffic you block, all that matters is that your ip will appear in the list of published exit nodes shortly after you start it up and that list will lead to you being blocked by other sites.
You will either need to operate an exit node from a separate IP than the computer (physically or via a separate proxy) you wish to connect to freenode with (or use their hidden service) and Slashdot or you will need to forego running an exit, no matter how configured (I suppose if you personally knew someone at Slashdot or one of the admins of freenode you might finangle a personal exception...).
Most of these sites have this policy because of actual past abuses rather than a general philosophical dislike of anonymity or tor.

I have not been able to continuously run tor since 0.2.0.31.  EVERY version since fails to run continuously (0.2.1.7, 0.2.1.8, and now 0.2.1.9).  It starts fine, it runs for a while, then simply stops running without any error messages, nothing.  It just stops.
What the hell has been changed in tor to so totally wreck it?  Perhaps core parts of it should be left as they were in 0.2.0.31 since that works flawlessly.  I cannot detail the problem since there are no log entries to show why it is failing.
I am running Mandriva linux 2009.0, kernel 2.6.27.  Tor builds without hitch and installs without issue.  It simply will not run continuously and will not produce any log messages as to why.

I hadn't seen this message in memorable recent history - but only this morning after tidying up my ports and other services so I assumed it was associated with some service I shut down.
In any case, all I got was the first message, no follow-up.  Just in case I shut down and restarted tor and haven't seen it again.  Very sporadic for me at this point and possibly a one-off event.

You might want to take a look at zfone and zrtp.  zfone is a free software phone that originates zrtp, an encryption scheme about to be implemented into a number of other free softphones (ekiga, for instance).  If you and your recipient have zfone (or a zrtp-enabled softphone) then it will automatically establish an encrypted, secure connection.  You don't get anonymity but you do get privacy.

From twitter, there is a user ("austinheap") out of San Fran who organized this.  It is simply having people setup squid proxies and sending the pertinent info to him by email or twitter direct message:  ip address and port (change from the default port and other "standard" ports...I set mine up for port 8808).  He then compiles the list of ips and port info and passes it along to his trusted iranian contacts who then disburse the info to their trusted friends.
Try   click through the first blurb screen image in green to get to the actual site.  He has an entry about 1/3 down the page titled "Best proxy practices" for this situation, providing guidance to help and get around the Iranian govt censors.

There is a parallel tor bridge effort going on.  You setup your tor bridge and send you information to ph.on.twitter at gmail.com.  Austinheap (among one or two others) collects the squid proxy info and passes it on and the people behind explaining how the iranians can quickly setup and use tor are collecting bridge info.  Their original website ( appears to be toast but the tor main website is linked to from one of the protest aid sites and I've seen many links to tor in twitter.  I am trying to verify that the ph.on.twitter email is still active and good.
Also:   has some info.  He provides the squid info but also recently posted that Freegate appears to be working (hadn't heard of freegate until now) in  Iran.  Apparently, it is popular with chinese in evading their firewall censors.

I have just built and installed tor-0.2.1.15-rc in replacement for my previous 0.2.0.34 version.  Nothing has changed from before this upgrade, not the location or entries in my torrc, not the perms on tor, not the perms on /var/lib/tor, etc.  When I try to start tor via vidalia, it now fails with messages:
Jun 04 13:23:43.160 [Warning] Error setting groups to gid 85: "Operation not Jun 04 13:23:43.160 [Warning] If you set the "User" option, you must start Tor as root.

I have a "toruser" group set on my system.  I am a member of the toruser group.  It worked before, but now it doesn't.  Then there is the doubletalk - "you must start tor as root" !!!!????  I read that it is a bad idea and totally unnecessary to run tor as root and here this message is telling me I MUST run it as root all of a sudden.  I want vidalia to start tor when I run it as a mere user who happens to be a member of the toruser group.  How do I do this?  Nothing I do with the vidalia settings changes anything and I am still prevented from running tor and I will not run it as root.  Someone, please explain/help?

Hello.  Tor is started by myself when I start Vidalia (or in the past, Tork).  I am not allowed to assign a password to the control port.
As I've run this for several days now, I am also finding another problem.  Vidalia will operate for a while but then at some point tor simply dies.  I cannot find anything in the vidalia logs to explain why.  I simply notice at some point that the vidalia onion icon in my kde panel has developed a red x signifying it is no longer operating.
Tork, which I would much rather use (because of the addon support like mixminion, anonymous telnet, anonymous ssh, anonymous IRC, etc) no longer works.  I upgraded from Mandriva 2009.0, tor-0.2.34, Tork 0.29, to Mandriva 2009.1, same tor and tork version, yet Tork will no longer function because the first run wizard will not bring up the root password dialog to permit modification of the privoxy config file and it wont bring up the pword dialog to set netstat to run as root.  Tor then fails to even start at all so I was forced to switch to Vidalia by default.  Now Vidalia and tor wont run indefinitely, producing a new problem.

Could one setup a VM with some arbitrary timezone for it alone and run tor and bind there so that flash and javascript cannot get such info as local timezone, etc?  Would it be possible to have the VM change timezone in some random/semi-random fashion so that any timezone (and other) info that could be otherwise acquired would be just as unreliable an identifier of your system/location as information acquired from a tor session?  Then, even if flash or javascript did try to pull information outside tor it would be totally bogus and ever-changing.  It would still be nice to be able to squelch any attempt by flash to find your REAL IP address by forcing it to ALWAYS exit via tor no matter what.

If I set my gateway to 192.168.0.5 and the DNS to 4.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.4, I get internet connectivity and name resolution but no tor network.  If I go into the ovpn subdirectory in my JanusVM directory and edit the client.conf by adding "remote 192.168.0.5" and then point my PC eth0 to the 192.168.0.5 gateway, then tun0 traffic picks up and my IP becomes 10.10.30.4 and my gateway becomes 10.10.40.1.  I lose the ability to connect to the internet at all.
I have also tried connecting to janusvm via kvpnc using the crts and config from JanusVM via the openvpn method but it never works - refuses to connect.
Thus, I either get full internet connectivity by making my gateway 192.168.0.5, the bridged eth0 connection for JanusVM in vmware-player but no tor or I get it automatically changed to gateway 10.10.30.1 and the "ip" becomes 10.10.30.4 and no traffic leaves the computer at all.

I previously generated a fully anonymous gmail account early last year.  Created it via the tor network without using any personally identifiable information, emails, or phone numbers.  I attempted to create another new one today but have run into a problem.  While I am not required to provide an email or phone number, when I complete the form (entering name and desired login, password, etc, and click "submit" I get a google page with "The page you requested is invalid" and cannot complete the creation of the account.   Does anyone know what the source of this problem is?  I am wondering if there is some setting in firefox or tor button that might be causing this issue?  I'd hate to have to create a new account by going to some public wifi location and doing this without tor first.  That degrades my anonymity for the email.

@_subject: JanusVM:  try again 
I could use some help in identifying what the gateway IP is supposed to be for me to connect my LINUX BOX to the internet via JanusVM.  All the howtos (the complete ones at any rate) that I can find are all for windows and are thus useless (they simply have you run the \\IP ADDRESS\Setup\Run.bat file and all is well).  I have a DSL router through which I connect to the internet.  My internal network is in the 192.168.0.0/24 range.  My linux box is 192.168.0.2.  My router/NORMAL gateway is 192.168.0.1.  WHen I run JanusVM in vmplayer, it produces \\172.16.98.129\Setup\Run.bat for windows users (totally useless to me).  The bridged eth device (eth0 in vmware) gets the IP of 192.168.0.5 but if I use this as my gateway, my IP becomes 10.10.20.(something) and my gateway becomes 10.10.20.1 for my real eth0 in linux and I lose all ability to connect to the internet (and have a hell of a time getting the release of my eth0 device so I can get back to a direct internet connection).  If I use the 172.16.98.129 address, nothing at all.  No connection whatsoever.
What is the gateway IP in this setup?

What if you setup a minimal VM for the mailserver?  It would have an independent IP and be accessible via tor locally and externally wouldn't it (if the routing is setup properly)? I used to use my own mailserver to send/receive but ended up having to quit simply because most of the recipient email systems would reject my sendmail - it wasn't registered so (I assume) the systems (yahoo, gmail, etc) probably thought I was a spam house or something and so would reject any mail I attempted to send.  Is your mailserver registered?  While all you need is a FQDN to do so, it may tend to break your anon unless you religiously keep that FQDN on tor so that no hostname search will ever pull up your real IP.

I am not an expert on this (I have vmware player running for windows xp and have played around with a tor vm - take a look here:   Otherwise, all you'd really need is an install of linux on your vm and also install tor.  The tor vm simply does the work for you (initially).  You get your vm setup and it can communicate back and forth with your local machine, and allow it access to the internet.  As for running a mailserver or just setting up a local sendmail system...the people I would send to would never receive the email, not even in their spam folder as the recipient's mail system would reject my locally sent emails out of hand.  It has been a while but the gist of the messages I would get with the "mail delivery failure" was yahoo, gmail, etc, didn't recognize my sendmail server as legit.  It is too easy for a spammer to simply setup on their own system and spam all day - so the big providers now check to see if your sendmail setup is "legit" by seeing if it is officially registered as an mx or the like (or so it appears). It wasn't always like this.  Four or so years back I had no problem sending mail using my own system's sendmail (postfix).  Then settings changed fairly rapidly at most big mail providers and I lost the ability to send mail using my local sendmail.  If you have to register your server, then unless you completely lie, then you are terminating your own privacy/anonymity by using a self-registered system.  You can always setup a mail account anonymously (using tor to set it up) and just make sure you never connect to it without using tor (or a VPN service).  Gmail is apparently out for doing this now.  I have had no luck lately trying to setup a truly anonymous gmail account.  It has been a while since I did so with yahoo so I don't know if they screw it up for this too now or not.  There are alternatives.

A lot of sites & services don't like Tor users because they can't tell if you like privacy / anonymity or are up to no good.? I guess GMX has caught up w/ Gmail & others, making it hard to create accts using Tor.

These cookies are NOT blocked by disabling all cookies / all 3rd party cookies in Firefox.? Even if they were, TBB ships w/ allow all cookies enabled.
One of the many ways / places (up to 12 - 15) that the js loaded evercookies can be placed is as an LSO / flash cookie.? There are many other traditional & non traditional places these cookies are stored.? AFAICT from reading research, these cookies CAN transmit data that could compromise Tor users' anonymity - as they certainly can in Firefox.? They are also very difficult to del & "stay" deleted (thus, sometimes called Zombie cookies).? Deleting cookies by "normal" means does NOT delete them.
Numerous research reports that I've read say one of the only ways to block these is disable js for most sites (as in, using No Script), but that supposedly makes users more susceptible to fingerprinting, by only allowing certain sites to load js content.? Yet Hulu was one of the worst offenders for using evercookies (I don't use Hulu, BTW), but is whitelisted in NoScript.
Have Tor devs looked into THESE special types of cookies & if they potentially compromising anonymity or even increasing chances of fingerprinting, due to information they transmit about every site you visit?

no, HTML5 videos are not the same as flash videos. The problem with
flash videos is not the video itself, it's a problem because the player
is closed source and you can't control what flash is doing in there.
But with HTML5 videos the browser is the player and so in Firefox,
Chrome, ... its open source. Sience there is no other plugin needed the
browser simply fetches the parts of the video he needs. You can actually
watch that in a tool like Firebug, ... .

rejects non-PGP mail. Exim seems to have the configuration option for

Torservers.net is currently a project under a German non-profit. In

lawful interception.
I'd like to see a full design for it first, and then the components, and
the configuration for each component, so this is easy to set up and
replicate by anyone. For example, how do I configure Postfix to relay
certain incoming mail to a configured hidden service, how do I make it
so it only rejects non-PGP mail for some accounts, etc.

China doesn't succeed to 100%, but that's not much of a win. Look how
many users used the Tor network before any Tor-network censorships and
how many people figure out using bridges. The goal of preventing many
people from gaining that information and slowing down the flow of
information works very well for them.
Don't forget the assumption behind Tor: there are enough free
countries, which tolerate volunteers hosting Tor servers. If that
assumption breaks down, Onion Routing doesn't work.
Also keep in mind, that there are no Tor servers in China. When the US
starts banning Tor, it will be almost the end of the Tor network. The
core developers live in the US, when they get told, to take another
job, it will be difficult to find new developers. Without Tor servers
in the US and a few other countries with a noticeable amount of Tor
servers, there is usable Tor network anymore.

Https everywhere would block all 3rd parties except the NSA from seeing your information but you are giving that information to the govt system as a requirement for signing up so what is the point of going the extra step to hide what you have to provide anyway? The site must know who you are, where you live, your income, number of family members, health state, etc, things that google and other companies already know from all your shopping, web searches, etc.  Your identity and location, in particular, is required so hiding both via tor is kinda pointless.  Https everywhere would suffice to stop all 3rd parties who are not naturally going to get the information anyway.

I don't understand how you concluded that they don't need Tor.
Using HTTPS-Everywhere with a regular browser in incognito mode doesnt
reduce the amount of information you send to the destination - it only
makes the connection not snoopable by third parties and reduces
information kept by the browser for later sessions or tabs.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Private email 
If you never use your real name in emails, if you don't use it to email a bunch of non-anonymous friends or family, if you ALWAYS use tor for that account then you will remain essentially anon. I myself have a safe-mail account that is completely anon. Signed up for it on tor and never connect to it without tor...I also never use it for family/friends, etc (thus it doesn't get much use - I'm military so set it up for potential use in whistleblowing if needed). Unless you have a bunch of anon friends who never use names or identifying addresses or phone numbers in any messages ever, then it should be anonymous.

In my attempt to set up a secure anonymous email system I thought it might be easier to sign up for a free web based email account while using the TOR browser.
Do you know how hard it is to do that with java script disabled?
I must have tried 30-40 different places such as yahoo, gmail, gmx, hotmail, etc.... No java script, no account.
I assumed if I signed up while using the TOR browser then they would never have an IP address associated with the email address.
I finally found "ATLAS.CZ" which let me sign up without java script enabled.
However during the process I realized the "CAPTCHA" code they wanted me to retype was using symbols I did not have on my keyboard.
I finally solved that problem and now have a working email address (in Czech) that has never been exposed to my real IP address. (I was using TOR browser through the entire process)
My question is, Can I count on being anonymous if I continue using the TOR browser to log into the web based account and send emails? (java script is always disabled).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Indirect Tor question 
In light of the recent revelations of how the NSA has broken commercial
software all over the place, I wonder about the security of Oracle's
VirtualBox VM software used by Whonix (and other?) tor-based anonymity
systems.  A large portion of VirtualBox is open source but some
libraries used are of different licenses...so perhaps somewhere in those
non-opensource libs lay an NSA backdoor?
I'm wondering about any and all similar tor-based systems wherein there
is ANY portion that is not opensource.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Blacklists 
I was wondering...would a change to tor exits so they direct through public proxies/anonymizers get around black lists? ?The tor user would still be anonymized but the ultimate source address seen by blacklisting websites would NOT be a tor exit so blocking tor exits would fail...
Is this too simple? ?Perhaps add a setting that those who run exits could configure so their exit routes to a proxy? ?

Call me pessimistic if you will but unfortunately censorship is
something the heavy weights that run the joint want, and since they
own the media and make the laws is something that isnt going to go away.
Having said that...
1) Many of us can slow the tide and make things very difficult for
them, something they would rather avoid, sometimes but not often to
the point of them giving up, but at the end of the day these people
have all the power, money and make the laws ultimately they get there
way. Remember there is a lot at steak, there ability to lie to the
masses and maintain propaganda superiority is a powerful tool (which is
what this is really all about) they aint just going to throw away
because we want privacy.
2) Business's have no interest in stopping Tor anyway persay as
pointed out it loses them money from potential interested customers,
so an open recommendation of good practice from a reputable group like
the EFF could work wonders. You should just treat anonymous people as
anonymous people and restrict there ability to cause damage
accordingly, if they want more access rights get an account and login.
3) We cannot stop them doing censorship its a pretty forgone
conclusion it isnt going away, but what we can do is change it from
the government choosing to the community standard (us) choosing. Not
particularly easy but there are ways of doing distributed voting systems.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Blacklists 
I think the thinking needs re-thinking. ?Tor becomes less and less useful, and less and less attractive to users as more and more sites block tor. ?The diminishing returns feeds itself. ?More people quit using tor because many or most of the sites they are interested in prevent them from viewing them, fewer and fewer relays are provided as people quit tor, tor becomes weaker and weaker. ?Rinse, repeat.?
I do not think sites should be able to simply block classes of traffic just because they want to. ?Blocking a spammer is one thing, it is a response to a single demonstrable negative action but blocking an entire class is what anti-discrimination laws in the real world are used to stop. ?Because it is unjust and simply bad. ?Why should it be different on the internet? Carve out the internet from basic societal rules/laws so discrimination by class is perfectly OK? ?
I'm merely stating that the simple ability to make a quick and easy setting change in the exit is all that is needed, not an automatic and broad default change to tor exit behaviors. ?
Responding to growing blacklists by shrugging one's shoulders and saying, "Oh well, you're wrong to do so but...oh well" is not a functional response. ?It is a promise of less and less usefulness of tor...unless the ultimate goal is to provide, in the end, just an anonymous chat infrastructure since that seems to be the ultimate end point as sites block tor in greater numbers.

The FAQ gives 3 reasons why Torproject doesnt encourage that particular
solution to blocking of Tor:
To quote therefrom:
a.? ? We can't help but make the information available, since Tor
clients need to use it to pick their paths. So if the "blockers" want
it, they can get it anyway. Further, even if we didn't tell clients
about the list of relays directly, somebody could still make a lot of
connections through Tor to a test site and build a list of the addresses
they see.
b.? ? If people want to block us, we believe that they should be allowed
to do so. Obviously, we would prefer for everybody to allow Tor users to
connect to them, but people have the right to decide who their services
should allow connections from, and if they want to block anonymous
users, they can.
c.? ? Being blockable also has tactical advantages: it may be a
persuasive response to website maintainers who feel threatened by Tor.
Giving them the option may inspire them to stop and think about whether
they really want to eliminate private access to their system, and if
not, what other options they might have. The time they might otherwise
have spent blocking Tor, they may instead spend rethinking their overall
approach to privacy and anonymity.
