@_subject: HTTPS Google Search has New URL (Old one causes problems) 
Hey all
I am not sure if TOR relevant stuff like Tor Button & HTTPS Everywhere has
been updated.
I just wanted to let you know, in case you are not aware, that the new HTTPS
Google Search is now located at The old HTTPS was at  however it causes problems
sometimes, for example when you press enter after typing in your search
query nothing happens.
PS. There were some news articles regarding this (Google: encrypted google)

@_subject: Using "Authority Servers" (directory authorities) as Entry Nodes? 
Nodes: dizum, Tonga, dannenberg, maatuska are identified as being
"Authority Servers" on I set the following in my torrc file:
EntryNodes dizum, Tonga, dannenberg, maatuska
StrictEntryNodes 1
Is my anonymity broken as the above nodes are "Authority Servers",
therefore they can log and identify the flow of traffic, mapping
destination and sources?

@_subject: Tor Browser Bundle for Windows contains Firefox 3.5.9? 
Why does the Tor Browser Bundle for Windows contain Firefox 3.5.9 and NOT
the latest Firefox 3.6.4 or 3.6.3?
The 3.6 version of Firefox has more Bugs fixed than the 3.5 version.

Is JanusVM open source?
Does JanusVM make you an exit node without your permission?

@_subject: SSL only firefox add-on? 
Let me say this first:
One company had a firewall that blocked all non SSL traffic.
So if you go  and you sign in, it will stop you
at one URL which was not https.
I am not sure if Gmail still does this i.e. redirect you to non https
(http) url after login, and then again go into https mode when you
enter gmail.
So this firewall used to give error saying not allowed, but when you
changed it to https, the previous Gmail redirect url worked, and I
could login to Gmail.
Now is there an add-on that does this in Firefox?
Block ALL http traffic by default?
Then maybe like how Adblock plus is - "Disable on this page only"
allows http traffic only for that page?

I want the HTTP URLs to be blocked entirely, so that it is not passed on to
But I still want the HTTP URL to be in the Firefox URL bar, so I can try if
https works (by adding the "s").
If it doesn't then I can disable it on that URL.
However if I redirect it to a page on my local host, won't it come like this
in the Firefox URL bar C:\block.html ?
Basically I guess I am looking for something that the corporate firewall
did...I think it did that because all the company resources to do work was
on https website, and there was no need to surf the interwebs...and in those
days there was no https Google....

In Vidalia there is a GUI known as "View the Network"; In that you can see
all the nodes you are connected to i.e. Entry Node, Middle Node, and Exit
You can also see all the connections passing through the Tor like

Is there a way to see this information in JanusVM?
I want to run some Socks program like FreeCap or something after the
TOR...but I want to make sure the Socks connections are going through TOR
and not directly from my IP.
Therefore if the Socks is logging the IP address (honey pot socks etc.) that
it serves, it will only see Tor exit nodes, not my IP.
Is this possible? To use a VPN and then on top of the VPN use a Socks layer?
I installed JanusVPN using the Run.bat command that is provided inside
