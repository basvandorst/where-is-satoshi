@_subject: Tor 0.0.9.1 crashes 
I've been running running Tor ever since it came out and upgraded to
version 0.0.9.1 as soon as it was released. 0.0.9.1 has proven to be
the least stable for me as it crashes more than a few times per day.
I'm running it under Windows XP Pro. Prior to each crash, there's a
Windows Error message warning of a Debug Error. Following is the screen
log at the point of crash:
