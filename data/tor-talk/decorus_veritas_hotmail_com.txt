Greetings Tor Talk,
I am a tor user with a question. I was encouraged by the Tor Project support team to send my question out to you all.

Sebastian, thanks for the great feedback! I'd love to just create shortcuts manually, but I'm not sure how to do even that much in the Tor Browser. For example, if I right click on a page, there is no option to save a shortcut to the desktop. And while I can create bookmarks, I cannot shortcut bookmarks either. And I don't see any other options to save shortcuts manually, not even in the menu bar. It's like the Tor Button scrubs the whole thing. All I've been able to do is copy the url's out to a non-Tor browser, and then save the shortcut. But that is less than idea, since it exposes my browsing.

Sebastian, I like your manual method! I was not aware that Windows had a feature to create shortcuts from the desktop. I'll do that for the time being, unless someone else has an idea about why the Tor Button is blocking my ability to make shortcuts. Thanks!
