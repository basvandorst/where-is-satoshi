Hash: SHA1
I am trying to set up a tor server. I do this for the first time, so
please bear with me if I overlooked something simple.
Currently I fail at step 4 of the instructions (sending the
fingerprint to tor-ops at freehaven.net ).
The fingerprint in my DataDirectory ( /var/lib/tor ) is simply not
generated, all I find in that directory is a file called cached-directory.
Under the given links I can not find my server as part of the tor
network (I don't quite understand the contents of that link, but I
nicknamed my server "gubi" and I can't find that string on that page).
So it seems sending the fingerprint really is a crucial step.
tor runs as user tor, I use the setup.sh script from the contrib
directory with appropriately edited users and paths to start tor.
The only point where I didn't follow the instructions closely is that
my system clock is about half an hour off. I can't change this because
I run on a virtual server, which uses the underlying hardware clock,
to which I have no access.
I use tor 0.1.0.5-rc.
Thanks for any suggestion,

No, I didn't. I have a fingerprint now. Thanks.
In tor's logfile I now find a couple of messages like
[notice] directory_handle_command_get(): Client asked for the mirrored
directory, but we don't have a good one yet. Sending 503 Dir not
Should I worry about this?

A question crept up to me and this thread seems the right place to ask
it (although it certainly has been asked before).
If I cause a lot of meaningless traffic over tor, couldn't I hide
meaningful traffic in this noise and thus be secure against timing
attacks? Say, I start a large download and visit a website while it
runs. Wouldn't a global observer only see the net traffic coming from
my node? Wouldn't this make it impossible for them to correlate this
traffic with the traffic at the website I visited?
