Hi all
I have been using tor without problems under Fedora 19 and Mint 16. But 15 days ago I upgraded to Mint 17 and noticed that tor wasnt working at all. After watching the logs for a couple of days, I found this warnings and errors:
Jul 28 08:51:10.000 [warn] Problem bootstrapping. Stuck at 10%: Finishing handshake with directory server. (DONE; DONE; count 10; recommendation warn)

Is ther eany way to solve this? Or perhaps my ISP found a way to block tor?

AFAIK, Mint doesnt implements a firewall and the PC is connected directly to internet.
I installed tor from Mint repos, but I have been thinking to get some source .deb and compile it myself. Asked about this problem in Mint forums, but got no answers.

Ok, I had to install from sources, not the bootstrap is completed. Firefox can successfully connect using tor as socks5 proxy. But if I configure tixati bittorrent lcient to use tor, I got an error about proxy auth failed. Here is the tor log:
Jul 28 15:39:24.000 [warn] Socks5 username/password version 5 not recognized; rejecting.
Jul 28 15:39:24.000 [warn] Fetching socks handshake failed. Closing.
Im using tor just to connect to the http trackers, because my ISP has bloqued connections to all torrent trackers, not to hide my IP. Once I get a connection to a tracker, I manage connections to client directly.
