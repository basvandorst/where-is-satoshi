Sounds to me like the another person was correct. You're not joining the right server. There's a bunch of IRC servers and if a certain channel requires you to be on (example) the Rizon server, connecting to  through Freenode will not work.

This is particularly interesting and unexpected.? Creating a way for an average Joe to use tails sounds great.? Mind if I ask what is the 4k support like for those of us that have it?  Thursday, 24 December 2015, 11:00pm +11:00 from  tor-talk-request at lists.torproject.org :

Find ways to compromise their websites and find information about their followers. Then release that info to the authorities. That'd be the best plan of attack for now.

Bob, with respect, stop. Have you ever considered the reason why they're closing down and not paying anyone is because the company is absolutely broke? It's a very common occurrence in economics for a business to appear booming and fluid to the public, but have no money in actuality. Yeah, it sucks. No jobs and no warning is pretty shit, but sometimes this happens. The people should be instantly planning to look for another job and pursue action later, not pursue action now and then complain because their lawsuit fails and they're homeless.

Where do we even begin countering the catastrophe that is the Trans Pacific Partnership? Apparently it passed through today.? Where were you when the internet officially died?

Depends what you mean by you want to be tracked. Through normal internet? Tor? Through the normal internet, just freshly install windows 10 and then install an ethernet capture device so you can show your class how many connections to microsoft it makes. That's the simplest method to demonstrate the dangers of being tracked, since sending data to Microsoft you don't know what they consider data (your life, news interests, porn habits, etc). If it's through Tor, I'll pass that along to someone else with more experience, but tracking through Tor is possible. Just hard I believe (harder than Mr Robot makes it out to be).

The fact people abuse a service like Tor to shitpost on social medias is just fucking pathetic to be honest. How bored does a person have to be? Sure it has its lows (underground websites) but its uses for genuine reasons are invaluable. Well, they were until troll made sure every website is anti-Tor.

I'd like to ask you guys how I can set up a Tor exit node. I figure I want to help make a difference in the best way I can for internet freedom, but the guide on the Tor wiki isn't very helpful. If you can provide links or detailed explanation (just 're:' me). Funnily enough I know how to set up a Tor server, but not a Tor exit node.
Thanks for the assistance to anyone who helps me. I figure people in here might be more useful than 50 article writers on websites trying to over complicate the process to earn their paycheck.

While Tor may be used for malicious purposes that's an academic issue.? Many people misuse the law to do illegal activities (crooked cops) does that mean we should abandon all law?
