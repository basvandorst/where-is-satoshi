Agreed, any data on the disk will have been compromised and any
private keys for example cannot be trusted.  The install can't be
trusted as some sort of rootkit could be trivially installed by
forensics types.
Other than wiping the drives and starting with a fresh install and
fresh keys, I would be less concerned about getting new drives than
about the keyboard and motherboard (which it sounds like they did not
touch, at least not to take with them).  If it is a common motherboard
in particular, a bios flash could have been done.  Also, the keyboard
could have been popped open and a keylogger installed.
Either of these keyboard / motherboard attacks could have been made
quickly and while the individual was detained for the day or in
another room during the search.  If someone high enough up was
interested, an arrest and taking the disks away seems like an awfully
strong heads up to me - I would expect someone who would be messing
with the drive physically would have been more subtle.
Even if they only took the disks, I personally would be replacing my
keyboard first, before disks.
Best of luck, and sorry you had to go through this.
