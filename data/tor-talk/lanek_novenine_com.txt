Which is what I am looking at.
I love football [I am European, hence football means: soccer]. In football,
there is a technique in which the defenders of one team slowly, or suddenly,
push the players of the attacking side in an offside position.
I see a _similar_ technique used against tor. If with the [tenable] rationale
of tracking the pedophile, the cyber-pirate or the terrorist, the ANONYMITY
[see below] of tor is suspended [e.g., by confiscating the hard disks of a
site] here, there, and in another place depending from the good will or the
malice of the others, the purpose [of anonymity in general] is eventually
What I am talking about is a way to introduce a kind of an auditable [who
does what, where and when], cryptographic 'sudo' in tor and a way to let the
*investigators* prove convincingly that they are behind someone/some people in
Bruce Schneier has written an article [-> google] on tor and ANONYMITY in
contrast with "privacy" or "security"--which tor doesn't affect. (By the way,
and *ironically* so to speak, Schneier not too rarely seems to be *aphasic*
[from aphasia] on the issue of *terrorism* there where, in his books, he
reasons on the topic with the *insight* and the *understanding* of, say, a
fourteen years old ... sadly and oddly [I would expect a better ... more
courageous--see Galileo--at the least, understanding of physics and statistics
from a mathematician].)

I fear not yet.
I am talking of tracking the OTHER SIDE, the *investigators*, what they
make/look at exactly in a tor server so to not let them, e.g., the *chance*
to confiscate the hardware; plus a mean to be convinced that they [the
*investigators*] are looking at X-Y only really, and that X-Y is effectively
being suspected of/investigated on Z ... without *ruining* the inquest of
What I am thinking at is possibly disjoint from how the system is currently
working. It's something for local [sitting in front of the server] use only.

That they are looking for something they legally can, yes. To "prove" is
an exaggeration, but to cryptographically audit what they do on a tor
server--with the possibility to shed light on later, should a *case* develop,
via an [counter-] investigation at a higher level--that should be practicable.
Zero-knowledge software should complement tor so to let the server
administrators establish that the investigators are those who pretend to be,
are behind a real case and are legally empowered to probe this or that.
In the case the legality of a given probe is verified, then the investigators
can open a backdoor while being audited cryptographically along their *travel*
into the data.
That should warranty that there is no need to storm a site and confiscate the
hardware, indeed it should make it illegal in general.
Possibly also, this is a topic which need to be studied and pondered well, I
am not a lawyer, nor a cryptographer.
This is something that doesn't happen in your country only, in fact I could
not tell one place in the world in which this doesn't occur. Is nevertheless
something that should NOT take place--and for that I am writing.
Ditto. I am from Switzerland, and I would be surprised if in the
country of the Rolex, the Zenith and the Tag Heuer you would get
your hardware back at all.
Agreed. I am the father of two daughters, a teen and an infant, and I worry on
the pedophiles less, in a sense. I am much, much more anxious on the tracing
of the [notice the Italic] *terrorists* ... I suppose you are not living under
a rock, have enough IQ, and follows the news. (Let me reiterate: if you know
French enough, read please the article whose URL I have given.)
And don't forget that tor adds zero to secrecy.
There is a book by Anna Seghers [a nom de plume], The Seventh Cross. It tells
the story of seven men who, one day, attempt an escape from a concentration
camp of the Nazi. They are hunted by the Nazi. One after the other they are
recaptured, who sooner who later , and publicly/demonstratively executed.
Minus the seventh, for whom the Nazi already have [symbolically] prepared the
cross for the cemetery.
This seventh fellow is a guy the Nazi do not manage to catch again.
Now, skipping bucolic or larmoyant reviews, and daring the A-B-C with Adorno
or Walter Benjamin, this seventh guy, whose escape success would have mattered
zero statistically, is on the other hand psychologically intolerable and FATAL
for an oppressor and a totalitarian.

    GOP Wishes The Internet Had Never Been Invented
    by: bluegal on Sunday, April 6th, 2008 at 7:30 PM
    It makes it way too easy for someone to document their crimes.
    [A]n internet agitprop artist publishing the website "Republican Offenders
    dot com" has produced a list of 272 Republicans charged with criminal
    activity, 60 of which are pedophiles. Each name is linked to a group
    heading of the type of crime alleged or convicted. (Among the categories
    are rape, bribery and "assorted felonies".)
    [T]he list really has to be seen to be appreciated.
Etc., where GOP = "Grand Old Party" = Republicans ... but I guess you know.
And for not having a hard time again, put a look at the percentage, and figure
the kind of GOP-fellows these are.
(By the way, I disagree with the thesis ... I mean, yes, the GOP--and the
others, of course--may wish the Internet had never been invented, but not
because the pedophiles [which can be tracked just easily even without the
Internet]. Maybe, and since 9/11 in particular, you can speculate on why such
a wish regarding the Internet is emerging is growing.)
Hint: it's more about an *external enemy* in general, be it the Martian or the
Venusian in particular if necessary and depending from the situation ... a bit
in the Procrustian [the guy of the bed: the standard and the reference being

@_subject: [OT] mitigating or defeating syntax analysis 
As a kind of *poor man*, temporary approach, you could add some slight
[random] noise, then use [lazy thesaurus mode so to speak] a spell-checker to
remove it. (If you know AWK or Perl, that's trivial, you don't have to be that
gifted programmer ... I wonder if there is not something at cpan.org already.)
Ditto with a thesaurus (and no noise) directly.
I would write my own expert program (deconstruct-synthesize-etc.) ... provided
I would have such a need--I don't ... not yet (but the *trend* is bad, very
bad), I mean. (And then exclusively as GPL software.)
As a preliminary, no-nonsense extra, you could adopt the *trick* good
translators use: first read WELL the source text, then put out of reach the
original, and write the destination text without looking back. Works well from
language A -> A also, within the realm of the same language that is. Repeat a
couple of times, with not too tiny dt's. (You will wonder how much the output
differs from the input.) I am assuming one doesn't need that kind of anonymity
every time ...
Notice that there is plenty of other *meta-factors* to consider moreover--of
the genre [example]:
    [U]sing tor with Polipo: Polipo has some rather specific traffic patterns
    (aggressive pipelining, range requests) that make it rather easy to spot.
    The websites you access won't know who you are, but they might realise
    you're running Polipo.^1
and similar.

We spied on 36,000 customers using the internet, admits BT
by Matthew Hickley, April 4 2008
    BT tested secret "spyware" on tens of thousands of its broadband customers
    without their knowledge, it admitted yesterday.
    It carried out covert trials of a system which monitors every internet
    page a user visits.
    Companies can exploit such data to target users with tailored online
    advertisements.
    An investigation into the affair has been started by the Information
    Commissioner, the personal data watchdog.
    Privacy campaigners reacted with horror, accusing BT of illegal
    interception on a huge scale. Yesterday, the company was forced to admit
    that it had monitored the web browsing habits of 36,000 customers.
    The scandal came to light only after some customers stumbled across
    tell-tale signs of spying. At first, they were wrongly told a software
    virus was to blame.
    Executives insisted they had not broken the law and said no "personally
    identifiable information" had been shared or divulged.
    BT said it randomly chose 36,000 broadband users for a "small-scale
    technical trial" in 2006 and 2007.

as nasty depending from ... how to say?, the *seasonal fluctuations* of the
news or the *gaffes* [read: too many sex-, and not, scandals hitting VIPs

showing within another interval, etc.], maybe with such a protocol added to
tor, for *internal* use, the threshold for seizing a hard disk to seek the
ENTIRE set of data just because A COUPLE of *bad apples* MIGHT be hiding
inside could be heightened, who knows.
I am not sardonic, I am saying: let the *investigators* give the chance to
prove that they really are behind something and legally [plus, *noblesse

Could tor profit from having some zero-knowledge protocol [or an adaptation

    U.S. May Ease Police Spy Rules
    More Federal Intelligence Changes Planned
    By Spencer S. Hsu and Carrie Johnson
    Washington Post Staff Writers
    Saturday, August 16, 2008; Page A01
        The Justice Department has proposed a new domestic spying measure that
    would make it easier for state and local police to collect intelligence
    about Americans, share the sensitive data with federal agencies and retain
    it for at least 10 years.
    The proposed changes would revise the federal government's rules for
    police intelligence-gathering for the first time since 1993 and would
    apply to any of the nation's 18,000 state and local police agencies that
    receive roughly $1.6 billion each year in federal grants.
    Quietly unveiled late last month, the proposal is part of a flurry
    of domestic intelligence changes issued and planned by the Bush
    administration in its waning months. They include a recent executive order
    that guides the reorganization of federal spy agencies and a pending
    Justice Department overhaul of FBI procedures for gathering intelligence
    and investigating terrorism cases within U.S. borders.
    Taken together, critics in Congress and elsewhere say, the moves are
    intended to lock in policies for Bush's successor and to enshrine
    controversial post-Sept. 11 approaches that some say have fed the greatest
    expansion of executive authority since the Watergate era.
    ...
Etc. I don't want to deviate too much from the *posting guidelines*, so
in short, observation: it's [double negation] UNTHINKABLE that the U.S.
administration and Tor as it is are NOT on a collision route.
To get the idea, and using a *neutral* example, two large [loaded] vessels
navigating at cruise speed, say a supertanker and a large container carrier
can't longer avoid--no matter what they try to do--to bump if they have
entered in a collision route within a distance of ?! ... ten miles [no loss of
generality]. (Because of inertia.)
Maritime navigation aside, much more REALISTIC [less neutral] examples--whose
realism increases further if you consider that significant portions of the
U.S. administration, the army, the media tycoons, and of the collaborators
[*staunch allied*] would get a death, or a long imprisonment verdict at the
least would they be judged NOW by a similar court such the one has principled
in Nuremberg--more realistic examples I was saying, and on what can be
expected, can be discovered at, say, globalresearch.ca.
Consider also--and I am quoting from conversations I have had for xyz
reasons [by chance mostly] long time ago in Napoli/Italia with an university
professor on international law AND a Camorra expert for the government--no
one can name/knows [real names] from the top [topmost] of the hierarchy of a
mafia-like structure ... I mean, no one who is not part of it [top -- those
who really take capital decisions eventually] survives long enough to have a
chance to do so. [Maybe you can recall the case of people who are hijacked for
a ransom: if it happens that the former can recognize their hijackers, that
signifies that they will be killed]
Bush, Cheney, Rice, Blair, Sarkozy, ... and the others--these are exposed,
known figures ... vulnerable in a sense; at best [and don't even speak of
their *intellects*] they belong to a top-medium/bottom-high level.
Meaning: as things are currently, do not realistically expect much change from
a *new* president and administration transition [I am thinking here at the
route of collision with Tor in particular].
Hence here comes my [theoretical] point/question: what do the Tor designers
plan/think to do in view of the *crash landing* which [likely] is to expect?
What about the *zero-knowledge*-like mechanism I have proposed at the list
time ago? [Or any other mechanism which can safeguard anonymity while
providing incremental-as-a-function-of-real-evidences, LOCALIZED, and
TIME-LIMITED access to GIVEN investigators to Tor physical data?]
Because--and I am guessing--these are not peanuts-changes; not of the kind
that can be made stans pede in uno, when some other announcement will be made
suddenly, in contrast of things that become "quietly unveiled."
Other reading/teaching suggestion: "tonnara" what is it, how it works--maybe
there is something at wikipedia.

Adorno tells how a couple of very important discoveries of the last century

in a kind of dropped-out/come down metropolis--Vienna/Austria--of Europe
instead of, say, in the buzzing Paris or London. [Adorno:] The more
provincial/lethargic general environment of Vienna [-> Karl Kraus] may
paradoxically have permitted a more undisturbed work in these cases.

his opponents goal line than the ball, unless there are at least two of his
opponents nearer their own goal line than he is. A player is only declared off
side and penalized for being in an off side position.
     [Roy, and here comes the important part:] If a player is declared off side,
the referee awards an indirect free kick, which is taken by a player of the
opposing team from the place where the infringement occurred.

    Faulty Towers of Belief: Part II. Rebuilding the Road to Freedom of Reason
    Laurie A. Manwell, M.Sc.
        [Roy: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED READING ... the entire site,
    journalof911studies.com, contains highly recommended readings only]
It begins like this:
    Anyone who has common-sense will remember that the bewilderments of the
    eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out
    of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind's
    eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when
    he sees anyone whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready
    to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the
    brighter life, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, or
    having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light.
    And he will count the one happy in his condition and state of being, and
    he will pity the other; or, if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which
    comes from below into the light, there will be more reason in this than in
    the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the light into
    the den. - Plato, The Republic1
It continues like that:
    Imagine for a moment that it is you who has just been asked to re-evaluate
    some of the most basic beliefs that you hold about the world around
    you. Again, if you are reading this, it is likely that you have already
    been asked to reconsider your beliefs about the events of 9/11 and your
    perception of the world thereafter. How did you respond? How did those
    around you interpret your responses? And most importantly, how can you
    use the insights yo've gained in order to pass along to others the same
    opportunity to re-examine some of the core beliefs about the events of
    9/11? Similar questions have been asked long before September 11th 2001,
    by minds of greater depth and insight, yet we continue to be reminded of
    the necessity to ask them again and again -- to be vigilant and always
    question our beliefs - lest our beliefs enslave us to a reality that does
    not exist. Before we can ask others to re-examine their beliefs about the
    events of 9/11, we must do so first, we must lead the way by example. And
    we must do so through reason and with authenticity. ...
It introduces Plato's Allegory of the Cave ...
    Timeless Lessons from Plato's Allegory of the Cave: The War Between Faulty
    Belief and Reality
    Briefly reviewing the research on attitudes presented in Part I, we see
    that the attitudes people already have can be automatically activated by
    mere reminders of the events of 9/11, and the longer and stronger these
    attitudes are held, the more resistant they are to change. One mechanism
    of attitude change is through the experience of cognitive dissonance,
    wherein tension arising from conflicting beliefs, feelings, and actions
    compels one to resolve the inconsistency. However, when people feel that
    they are under some form of attack, including strong challenges to their
    existing beliefs and worldview, they may also engage in various defensive
    mechanisms, often in an effort to reassert a perceived loss of control.
    ...
It tells
    A brief synopsis shows Socrates giving Glaucon a description of human
    prisoners in a cave, who have been shackled since childhood and permitted
    only a very limited view of their surroundings, including various shadows
    cast on a wall, but never the men that cast them. Socrates then poses a
    series of questions to Glaucon regarding the nature of the prisoners'view
    of the world that is presented to them by their captors. Socrates points
    out that, for the prisoners, "the truth would literally be nothing but
    the shadows of the images." However, if the prisoners were to be released
    from the cave, this truth would be challenged, and this challenge could
    be observed in the various responses of the newly liberated men. Socrates
    continues with the following pivotal question: "Will he not fancy that
    the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are
    now shown to him?" However, liberation is much more a state of mind than
    body. Thus, as the former prisoners appear to be free to accept or reject
    it, their freedom is largely based upon their ability to integrate the new
    worldview with the old. Whereas some struggle to comprehend the meaning of
    two opposing worldviews, some simply cannot. And only a few can transcend
    both and truly be free in body and mind ...

     1. From the 'Journal of 9/11 Studies Home':
           Thank you for visiting The Journal of 9/11 Studies, a peer-reviewed,
     open-access, electronic-only journal, covering the whole of research
     related to the events of 11 September, 2001. Many fields of study are
     represented in the journal, including Engineering, Physics, Chemistry,
     Mathematics and Psychology. All content is freely available online. Our
     mission in the past has been to provide an outlet for evidence-based
     research into the events of 9/11 that might not otherwise have been
     published, due to the resistance that many established journals and other
     institutions have displayed toward this topic. The intention was to
     provide a rapid acceptance process with full peer review. That has been
     achieved. It is now our belief that the case for falsity of the official
     explanation is so well established and demonstrated by papers in this
     Journal that there is little to be gained from accepting more papers
     here. Instead we encourage all potential contributors to prepare papers
     suitable for the more established journals in which scientists might
     more readily place their trust. One paper has already been published in
     a mainstream civil engineering journal: Fourteen Points... and more are
     being prepared for submission.

"Has nothing to do with TOR" is of course--don't take offense--nonsense per

"Other stuff." You know [maybe you don't], apparently *chaste*, or uninformed
at the least, statements such the "Chinese dissidents" are not that really
disconnected with, afar from 9/11 [it's context and *goals* I mean].
Not sure it's that easy to realize/carry out [see above]--who is the

These are also [politically] hard, critical and dangerous times really. Tor's
scope--people's ANONYMITY over a KEY medium, the Internet--is completely under
fire, directly concerned. I am exaggerating, but it's unbelievable to profess
to be able to keep strictly non-theoretical perspectives out. It's like to
pretend to study, say, forensic without speaking of the crimes, the criminals
and their victims.
The thing seems much more a boo-boo to me, a tempest in a teapot. Blame
yourself instead if you ["you" figurative] are an idiot, and make silly
statements. Think twice before stating bullshit, don't state on things
you don't know, all obvious predicaments already ... Tor is intrinsically
sensitive, touchy by its object.
Don't reply if you don't care, don't read, don't take the bait, this is best
strategy. Those *tempests* are enough localized, e.g., our physicist has
walked all along a path--there have not been surprises.

Ukraine opposition to send Georgian leader neckties to chew on

    to send 365 neckties to Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, who was
    recently caught on camera nervously chewing his garment while discussing
    the Georgian-Russian conflict.
    Saakashvili has caused an internet sensation with his tie-chewing antics,
    captured during a phone conversation with a top Western official and aired
    by the BBC, and also over footage of him running in apparent terror after
    speaking to reporters, believing he was about to be attacked by Russian
    planes.

    Party of Regions lawmaker Boris Kolesnikov told a crowd of supporters in
    the east Ukrainian city of Donetsk: "We have already bought Saakashvili
    spiked running shoes, similar to those worn by the Jamaican sprinter who
    won the Olympic 100 meters. We will also buy him 365 neckties, so that he
    will have enough to chew on every day of the year."

    says, "Help me, help me." But the ant refuses unless the elephants agrees
    to let the ant have his wicked way with her. Replies the elephant,
    "Anything! Anything!" So, out comes the thorn and up gets the ant and
    proceeds to enjoy himself. Meanwhile, in a tree directly above them,
    a monkey, who witnessed the whole episode, was in knots of laughter.
    Consequently he fell out of the tree on top of the elephant. Says the
    elephant: "Ouch!" Says the ant, in his own little frenzy: "Suffer BITCH,

This is typical bullshit from cnet.com, combined with straw man arguments
and--how nice to decipher--sour grapes sentiment from some *commissioner* [I
am regarding the cnet.com writer as pawn/lackey].
    We understand that there are serious privacy concerns that must be ad-
    dressed when collecting statistics from an anonymous network [9]. Tor
    is designed to resist traffic analysis from any single Tor router [1];
    thus, the information we log -- which includes at most 20 bytes of
    application-level data -- cannot be used to link a sender with a
    in most cases. We considered the privacy implications carefully when
    choosing what information to log and what was too sensitive to store. In
    the end, we chose to log information from two sources: First, we altered
    the Tor router to log information about circuits that were established
    though our node and cells routed through our node. Second, we logged only
    enough data to capture up to the application-level protocol headers from
    the exit traffic that was relayed through our node.

To let us understand:
    U.S. quality of life ranks low, going lower^3
    U.S. imperialism's proponents are fond of characterizing the U.S. as a
    land of "freedom and opportunity." This myth is shattered by the findings
    in a recently published study that uses U.N. research methodology to
    analyze socioeconomic conditions in the U.S.
    The study, published July 16, is titled, "The Measure of America: American
    Human Development Report 2008-2009." In it, researchers analyze the
    comparative ability of U.S. residents to access healthcare, education,
    employment and housing.
    Of the 30 richest countries comprising the Organization for Economic
    Cooperation and Development, the U.S. has the greatest proportion of
    children living in poverty. Despite spending more money per capita on
    health care than any other country on the planet, the U.S. ranks 42nd
    globally in life expectancy.
    U.S. infant mortality ranks 34th globally, according to the OECD report.
    If the U.S. were able to achieve an infant mortality rate as low as
    top-ranked Sweden, 20,000 more babies would survive here each year.
    ...
    From Bad to Worse
    The findings in this study are bleak indeed, but perhaps most troubling is
    the fact that the report is based on statistics from 2005. All the dismal
    statistics are drawn from the time before the mortgage crisis struck and
    the ensuing economic meltdown began.

false-flag/synthetic-terrorism-operation of 9/11 directly] ... I could easily

For those who can read French [but many articles from voltairenet.org are

    A Cuba, un groupe de femmes, les *Dames en blanc*, manifeste chaque
    dimanche pour la liberation de leurs proches. La propagande occidentale
    a tot fait d'y voir un equivalent aux *Meres de la Place de Mai* qui
    manifestaient pour les disparus argentins. Ce parallele permet d'assimiler
    le gouvernement cubain a la junte militaire argentine. Seulement voila :
    les detenus cubains n'ont pas ete enleves et tortures pour leurs opinions
    politiques, mais juges contradictoirement, condamnes pour intelligence
    avec l'ennemi, et incarceres. Les *Meres de la Place de Mai* risquaient
    leur vie, les *Dames en blanc*, elles, sont ouvertement salariees par les
    USA pour jouer ce happening hebdomadaire.
    ...
    Interrogee a ce sujet, Hebe de Bonafini, presidente de l'association
    Meres de la Place de Mai [1], universellement reconnue et respectee pour
    sa lutte infatigable contre les injustices, a denonce le rapprochement
    fallacieux effectue par les Dames en blanc et a eu une reponse assez
    cinglante envers les journalistes en question :
    "Tout d'abord, laissez-moi vous dire que la Plaza de Mayo se trouve en
    Argentine et nulle part ailleurs. Notre foulard blanc symbolise la vie
    alors que ces femmes dont vous me parlez representent la mort. Voila la
    difference la plus importante et la plus substantielle qu'il faut signaler
    a ces journalistes. Nous n'allons pas accepter que l'on nous compare

    About US$3 Million Spent per Second on Pornography

    http:/
    [Roy: link will expire within a couple of days]
    TEMPO Interactive, Jakarta: Head of Internet Rental Centers in Indonesia
    (Awari), Irwin Day, has that the money in circulation being spent on
    pornography has reached US$3.075 million per second.
    "Based on statistical data in 2006, more than 28,258 users per second
    look at pornographic sites," said Irwin at a press conference about Safe
    Internet for Children at the Department of Communication and Informatics,
    on Friday (25/7) last week.
    Irwin also mentioned that revenues from pornography throughout the world
    in 2006 reached US$97.06 billion, with 28 percent coming from China and 27
    percent from South Korea.
    He explained that 25 percent of all search engines looked for pornography
    every day and that 12 percent of total sites, or 4.2 million sites, are
    included as pornographic sites.
    "There are 420 million pornographic pages," said Irwin.
    He went on to say that some children have already started checking out
    pornographic sites when they are as young as 11 years old.
    The largest amount of consumers, however, is still adults aged between
    39-49 years.
    Irwin went on saying that in Indonesia, seven out of 100 top sites are
    pornographic sites.
    In terms of looking for the word `sex' at search engines, Indonesia is
    ranked number seven in Asia, while the largest amount of searchers for
    this word come from Pakistan.

Do all these "consumers" use Tor?! I doubt it VERY much.
Notice en passant that Indonesia's population is  in the world, though
Indonesia is certainly much far behind in Internet users ranking [where is China ... the People's Republic of China that is, who has surpassed the
U.S.]. And notice that the average income of the Indonesian is in the order of
a couple of hundredths USD/month: one-two-less, I should google. (Just to get
the idea of the imbalance.)

Not so much ... I wonder: are you fishing perhaps? This is Tempo Online
translated in English. There quite likely can be a *salad* ... quantitatively
speaking. (Reading the article is also--agreed--not always clear to understand
what is peculiar to Indonesia vs. what is general; moreover, Indonesia is
going to introduce a *great firewall* next year ...)
But qualitatively, they may not be that wrong.
I ignore how the business goes, but I remember to have read in Singapore of
astronomical *NETTO* sums made a month by pimps [in Singapore].
4.2 million sites make less than 1 USD a second per site. I don't know how
many hits *successful* sites have and how the *administration* goes in the
There are to pay: hosting, ==HEAVY== *commissions* on the left and on the
right for sure [Indonesia is the country with the largest Muslim population
in the world: you could drink Whiskey and Vodka and be *entertained* even
in Aceh too--paying of course]: protection from the police, politicians,
malavitosi, *insurances*, indemnifications for the ISPs etc. And so on ...
Internet-expenses-in-general inclusive [in Indonesia there are generalized
power outages daily since months ... up to 7-8-9-10 hours of blackout 7/24].
I guess that the *material* shown will be specialized ... meaning that it will
be *Asian* [and made in Asia, not in the Netherlands, U.S. or Switzerland],
not Russian nor Nordic. That will have a price too. They will then need some
certificates, or cellular phone infrastructure, for doing *business*--I would
include the latter too, the business extra [there are enough *bapak* in
Indonesia, a country of perhaps 230+ million, with MUCH more money to spend
than you have: Singapore's  foreign flat owners are Indonesian, I believe,
ethnic Chinese ones inclusive of course] in the balance.
I would add the *amortization* of the hardware--desktops, notebooks,
whatever--and of the time wasted by the "consumers."
3000, 300 ... even 30 USD/s [or who knows, 3 million a day] would still be
Could it be world-, or continent wide? ... but it makes even limited
difference, eventually; you are missing the point: to be, say, "drown, hanged
and quartered" [I am quoting a movie based a popular book] makes little
difference after stage one of the series has been carried out.
And *uncertainty [Heisenberg] principle* verified ... *interesting* in a
sense! For a couple of correct observations you have made you have written
some compensatory idiocies on a country which you clearly do not know.

Sorry for replying a bit a la hiccup-style, but in a Pavlovian sense I
am expecting the next blackout at any moment {I a am replying

Personally--but again, it matters *little* eventually--I have been puzzled
more by:

Tor, and more in general, the Internet as an authentic medium of knowledge
and communication, are certainly seen as an inconvenience by those who think
they can impose a new world order ... spare me to detail you why anonymity
is regarded as an annoyance in an authoritarian world. (In this sense goes
also the straw man strategy ... and kiss of death tentative of the cnet.com
article from the preceding posts: a simulated apprehension on something that
has been quickly surrendered already, or would be so--on fabricated arguments
by surplus!)
With recurrence we see attacks more or less feigned or resolute [be it even as
a--last resource--too problematic/dangerous service to deploy] against Tor.
One time it's: Tor as a heaven of the pedophiles; another time is: as a
present for the terrorists; and so on.
Like in the example of the Gestapo I have made time ago, here on the list, the
*legislators* of the new world order are trying to probe the terrain, to see
how people react and respond, how they resist disinformation, and are seeking
for the first chance to outlaw Tor. (Every time we analyze those pretexts and
charges--and you may be sure that they are monitoring us on that--we see that
their *arguments* do not hold logically.)
Better to let them know. Away--but beware that they have means--with the
thesis of the pornography branch in need of Tor [probably the opposite is even
true: m sectors of this *industry* expect and demand to harvest the lack of
anonymity of their customers]. Hence I disagree with your statement.

    FISA "Compromise" Completes Transformation of US into Full Police State
    by Larry Chin
    Global Research, July 11, 2008
    On July 9, 2008, the US Congress overwhelmingly passed legislation
    permitting government spying, including immunity to telecommunications
    companies involved in secret domestic surveillance programs. With
    the stroke of George W. Bush's pen, the US is now a police state by
    definition.
    The extent of the spying program, and its larger implications, have been
    revealed by Mark Klein, who blew the whistle on secret domestic spying
    program of Bush/Cheney's National Security Agency (NSA) and AT&T:
    AT&T whistleblower: spy bill creates infrastructure for police state
    The update of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, called the
    "FISA compromise", or more appropriately, the "spy bill", largely
    completes the triumph of the Bush/Cheney administration and a bipartisan
    criminal consensus. By convenient design, the FISA revision derails
    pending law suits filed against the Bush administration's corporate
    spying partners (AT&T, Sprint Nextel, and Verizon), silences (the
    largely empty-to-begin-with) congressional investigations into Bush
    administration's illegal domestic spying program. Presidential nominee
    Barack Obama and the Democrats have now moved to silence all discussion
    about the issue.
    Fear itself, a.k.a. spying itself
    Between the false flag mass murder of 9/11 and the creation of the
    "war on terrorism", the USA Patriot Act and this new FISA revision,
    the Bush-Cheney administration and its enthusiastically complicit
    congressional partners, have achieved total victory--world war, open
    criminality, and the end of law itself.
    It gives the US government unprecedented new spying powers and sweeping
    new legal cover for spying that goes well beyond even the original FISA
    law---which itself was an abomination that already permitted the US
    president broad surveillance powers.
    Given the fact that the US government is a wholly corrupted criminal
    organization by definition, the political spin over "oversight",
    warrants, the involvement of the Inspector General, etc. is all the
    more transparently ridiculous: the operatives of such apparatuses do
    not investigate or punish their own. Nor do they voluntarily stop the
    lucrative and intoxicating criminal activity that is their lifeblood.
    In fact, the debate over the spy bill is a red herring, clouding the
    larger central (purposely unaddressed) issue: the "war on terrorism" lie
    itself.
    The mass murder of 9/11 was a false flag operation, orchestrated and
    executed by the Bush administration. The "war on terrorism" is a perpetual
    covert operation, an endless pretext for war and murder, supported by a
    bipartisan consensus. (See "Who is Osama bin Laden?" and "Al-Qaeda:the
    database".) No 9/11, no "war on terrorism", no war in the Middle East. No
    "war on terrorism" lie, no dictatorial powers for the White House, and no
    beefed-up FISA.
    Given that the "war on terrorism" is a lie, the need for unprecedented
    spying is also a lie. Just as 9/11 remains the endless pretext for
    endless war and terrorism, it also remains, in its countless propaganda
    manifestations, the justification for open totalitarian rule of force and
    intimidation within US borders.^1
Etc. (Copyright 2005-2008 GlobalResearch.ca.)
Okay ... now, it's unthinkable that MIT can do what it decides--and how it
fancies by surplus. I have worked for money in my student years translating
news from French into Italian in Bern, at the Italian redaction of the Swiss
News Agency [at a time the agency was not *privatized* yet]. In case you don't
know--but you certainly do--every media/news business down to the little
newspaper in every country has some agencies' *eyes* working within it, more
or less directly and in quantity depending from the size and the importance of
the shop. Those who verify--and promptly correct *mistakes* be it by sending
updates, by replying or by writing mayor articles in reparation--are also
generally known within the shops.
Ditto within the universities--who depends from funds for their
researchers--and the academia [recommendations] more in general.
How is it a MIT? Of course I am obliged to feign asking at the list--similarly
to the fellow from the Brothers Grimm tale who talks to the stove because he
has promised to the devil to not tell anything to a living being. What could I
expect as an explicit answer from you: --everything is going like a charm-- or
--don't ask--?

I am multilingual to begin with. I use to visit google for an instant, even if
I don't need any services from it, just to see the IP of which country I have
inherited. (By the way, I typically get google in German.)
The main difference is ... should be, that the items are matched against
a given language with priority, which means that the sought entries may
be behind a lot in the list, eventually, and depending from the searching
criterii. (Examples: ada = VERY common verb in bahasa Indonesia.)
Another difference could be: selective censure. A third difference might be:
it becomes a bit harder for an expert program to guess/identify who is using
google. And the like, and so on.

[T]o our knowledge, Google is not doing anything intentionally
     specifically to deter or block Tor use.
... yet. Plus, we still have a denial of service problem--at best.
Thank you in any case.

Thank you, link noted. Actually I am not worried on google per se [I do
not--qualitatively speaking--trust google.com much than a given percent
anyway] ... ironically, I virtually never have made a search on google via
tor, neither I am planning to do so [but never say never].
More anxious makes me the potential of a *family of expedients* that could be
used tomorrow in general. Let's say, tor blocked like Ovaltine, Sprite, San
Pellegrino or the scissors at the airports today.
Example: [I could use more contemporary *illustrations*, but I am not
interested in starting a flame-bait] the Gestapo always *tested* the
population of the occupied countries during WW-2 [if they could do something
without the need to deploy a battalion, they tried that first] and acted
accordingly; if they wanted some people, but could not *take* them under given
circumstances illico et immediate, they re-tried a second or a third time,
maybe late in the night, the same day, or after one week, on the same place or
in another one.
Still another analogy is: boiling the Bullfrog. (Every router's administrator
could assert something similar google.com is telling ... depending from the
