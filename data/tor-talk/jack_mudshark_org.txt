One thing that I noticed about hidden services is that if a tor node
goes into hibernation, so do any hidden services it was providing. Which could be what is happening. --Jack Jack (John) Cummings                        PGP fingerprint: 0774 D073 E386 B70B 6B16  2D2B 1DD8 F8B0 CCF0 FAEE

@_subject: Thoughts on IRC.  
Upon furthur reflection, I think it may be better to set up an IRC
server (perhaps linked to an IRC network) as a hidden service, instead
of explicitly allowing IRC traffic via an exit policy. The problems:
1) Someone needs to set up and advertise an IRC server as a hidden
service. 2) The TOR address of the IRC server needs to be published. 3) To use this service, you need to figure out how to make an IRC client
work through SOCKS. Any other problems?

@_subject: Squid Proxy Causes Unavoidable DNS Leaks 
I made a sh wrapper around tor-resolve that outputs something that looks like
the output of dnsserver:
[jack at needle:jack]$ cat /opt/pkg/squid/libexec/tor-dnsserver
while read addr
        r=$(tor-resolve $addr)
        echo "\$addr 0 $r"
And in the squid.conf file:
cache_dns_program /opt/pkg/squid/libexec/tor-dnsserver
 /opt/pkg/squid/libexec/dnsserver
dns_children 5
as a first pass, it works, although it does not properly handle failed DNS
