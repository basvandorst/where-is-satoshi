@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and child pornography 
I think it's pretty clear that when someone puts on the list a complain about a popular hidden service being attacked, and refuse to give any information about the identity of the hidden service due to "legal", e.g. traffic shaping attacks recently, it will be a child pornography operation. It is well known that Tor onion sites are a haven for this, and research has shown a lot of hidden services use is related to these sites.
Is it really appropriate to use the tor-talk list to encourage child abuse? I do not think so. Obviously there is not much that can be done about these immoral websites due to the nature of Tor, but as the wider community of users of Tor, should not specifically helping child pornographers fix or protect their hidden service onions.

This is good. There is no reason that child pornographers should hide behind the excuse "I am just running the exit node". Otherwise every pedophile out in the wild could install Tor and no one could punish them at all. They found no evidence of as a molester so that is good too. Unless it was really but hidden.
