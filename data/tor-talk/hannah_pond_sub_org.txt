"temporary injunction", I'd think, would be an English term.
I think, in theory you're right. In practise it'll not be worth the
monetary risks and the hassle. What you'd gain would be just a few weeks
(most provider contracts can be terminated without reason within a few
weeks notice, and *that* is perfectly legal).
Now, the problem is that if the computer were *really* the instrument of
a crime, it could be permanently confiscated after conviction
(Einziehung/Verfall in German), and then the temporary confiscation
(Beschlagnahme) could be legal as preparation for the possible permanent
confiscation. And even if crimes committed via tor were not in the
responsibility of the exit node operator, it's a valid reasoning that
the crime could be committed by the operator from the same computer
using software *separate* from tor, using tor only as an excuse.
The question remains, is the suspicion strong enough for *that* case?
I.e. for a crime where the server operator would be really responsible
for, *and* for which a permanent confiscation would be probable in the
end (if the latter were not the case, yes, they should make a forensic
disc image and then return the server).
As said, the difference would probably only be a few weeks, or paying
back those few weeks of the server rental fee as damage for the
premature termination of service. So even then, it'd perhaps be more
economic the the providers to terminate the service. Or to terminate it
*with* prior notice as stated in the contracts. And then there'd be no
legal pressure. And to include anti-tor (and whatever) clauses in future
contracts (which would make termination *without* advance notice legal
for running tor etc. in future).
Kind regards,

@_subject: Tor TransPort on OpenBSD? 
OpenBSD has classical MAKEDEV style handling of /dev. However,
non-standard protections might be clobbered when you upgrade.
A better fix would indeed be opening /dev/pf before dropping privileges.
And the gold standard would be separating /dev/pf operations out into a
separate process, that drops root anyway, but keeps the /dev/pf file
descriptor and offers only those /dev/pf operations to the main process
that are really needed instead of making *all* /dev/pf operations
available to the main process. (Privilege separation.)

But in the end, the situation is all the same for HTTP(S) as for BT. BT
can (and *is*) used for legal content. E.g. I've already pulled (and
redistributed, i.e. contributed) OpenBSD *legally* via bittorrent (of
course not via tor). OTOH, you can use http(s) for illegal content, too.
Especially via ssl.
And, if I see things right, the bandwidth argument doesn't compute.
IIRC, only the client<->tracker traffic is relayed via tor, and that's
not the mass traffic of the actual big files. That's different when you
pull big files via http(s) which you keep allowing (and big files also
encompasses just bloated web sites with tons of inline and background
images, or even flash stuff or whatever).

[repaired quoting style.]
Cover traffic is only there if the tor instance(s) also run as relay.
In that case to be fair they should be declared a family. And then, one
could also run *one* tor node for all users with the appropriate
multiple of the allowed bandwidth, which should attract about the same
cover traffic as if you run a tor instance per user with less bandwidth
per instance.

@_subject: How can I set going more one Tor daemons? 
I think you are indeed.
If you run the instances as client only, there's no cover traffic, just
the traffic of the different users.
If you run separate tor instances, their circuits (first hop) are
necessarily on different TCP connections, so their different usage
patterns will show separately.  If you run one tor instance for all
users, they might use the same entry guard together, multiplexing the
different usages onto one TCP connection to the same entry guard.  That
hides the usage patterns by adding them together, IMO.  The second hop
then might split up or not, depending on needs, and even more so the
third hop (from the second to the exit node, where the dependency on the
exit policies comes to play a role).  I don't know/remember whether tor
relays in turn multiplex traffic "received" from different clients
together for the next hop if possible (i.e. different clients using the
same entry guard and the same second hop, mixing/multiplexing that
traffic onto the same TCP connection).  If so that would yield even more
anonymity, but only if the different users use the same second hop at
the same time (and switching over to different circuits at the same

For OpenBSD, the recommended way is using the pre-built packages. If you
are on a release, use the release packages from CD or the release
directories on the ftp mirrors. If you are on -current (snapshots or own
build, usually after starting from a snapshot), you use packages from
the associated package snapshot directory.
The packages can be built from the ports collection. You get the ports
collection from CD (for release) or from ftp (for release) or via any of
the cvs-related access methods (for release/stable, or for -current).
Match the ports "branch" to what you run as base system, of course.
release/stable ports for a release/stable base system, -current ports
for a snapshot/-current base system.
For ports, you build the package by entering the appropriate directory
(e.g. /usr/ports/net/tor) and saying make package. The package is built
in /usr/ports/packages//all/tor-.tgz.
You can also say "make install", which is make package + pkg_add for the
package so generated. Dito for polipo or privoxy (both of which are
provided as package and port). The ports infrastructure might need
ftp/http access to retrieve the source distributions of the original
software, but you may retrieve the appropriate files manually and put
them into /usr/ports/distfiles/ if automatic fetching fails. (Try make
fetch-list in /usr/ports/... to get the list of files the port would try
to fetch).

Right. W/o OTR or something like that, you might have anonymity, but at
the prize of being more easily attacked at malicious exit nodes.
But even then, people really *needing* privacy must think for themselves
anyway. Other default settings may still not be taken as a sign that things
are already safe. And one must always be very conscious about one's
behavior. What does turning logging off help if one conveys information
