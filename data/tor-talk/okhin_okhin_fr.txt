You should rather move to FLOSS and decentralized search engine such as
seeks (seeks-project.info) or Yacy.
I run a personnal node for seeks for more than a year now, on the
latest experimental version, and I do not use any other search engine
since then.
And you can run a node in a .onion
[Disclaimer: i've got some involvment with the seeks people]

Well, no java (I know, not a good reason). And I met by accident people
from seeks, while I never met someone from the YaCy project.
Also the development is pretty active and works fine, they add a lot of
new features (the last one is the Readability one, that extract only the
part of a website that will interest you) and they are reallynice

Well, seeks does works fine with SSL, that's how my node is working.
The thing is, you can have your own personal node somewhere on a host
you have and use it for your own private use (and still, if you want,
share your answers by P2P with other seeks node), you can even use it
as a proxy.
If you want privacy, you needto build your own services, which either
yacy or seeks gives you. You can even hide seeks in .onion. Or use
seeks as a proxy for your search needs.

Hash: SHA512
Ohai list,
I'm currently trying to find a way to easily spread some pre-configured, pre-installed devices embedding a tor-relay. And I have some TP Link hardware, the smallest of them being the WR703N ( Those devices are cheap and handy (can actually run on battery for years,since it does not consumes that much power... around 1W/h).
Tor can actually fit on them (as long as you build an OpenWRT firmware including tor), and you even have around half a megabyte of space on the 4MB flash drive after that. And it runs pretty much easily (I used the notes here  for the whole process).
However, given the relatively limited capability of those devices, 4il wondering if they can have enough entropy to run Tor safely, and if it won't endanger the network.
So,before going further on the step of propagating those Tor small boxes, I need advices about this entropy. Is it an issue? Is there a way to work around it (generating keys and certificates on a different computer maybe? but then, how?)
With datalove,

Thanks, exactly the kind of answers I was looking for. So, not a relay then, I'll go for a transparent proxy then.
And the entropy seems ok (at least, I need to do some tricks before generating keys, but sounds manageable from here).

You probably wanna read about onion.mx which did just that.
