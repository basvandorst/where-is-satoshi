@_subject: Some problems setting up a server 
I'm new to this and apologize in advance, in case I ask questions that have been asked too often. I have checked the Internet up and down and didn't find the right answers - maybe just because I wasn't able to formulate the question properly.
My system: OpenSuse 10.2 with current updates, Tor 0.1.2.16, and yesterday added Tork 0.18 (not CVS, that didn't compile properly), as I prefer the graphical interfaces...
1. I started using TOR a few days ago, and yesterday managed to set up the server. After a while (I'm not sure how many hours) my Internet connection was completely gone, so that I had to restart the PC. I'm not sure if that has to do with using TOR as a server, but if others have had such an experience, I would like to know what could cause it, so I can fix it - if it's related.
Currently, the server is turned off.
2. I receive messages from the server in the log:
I found out that kmail and nscd were doing that. nscd is caching DNS requests - should I disable that? It's said to improve performance quite well. Or is there a way to integrate it in TOR? Or can I just ignore the message?
Now, that is what I want to avoid. But I didn't find a hint how TOR found it out, or which program makes it possible, or which settings I have to change. I followed the book when setting it all up and was happy that it was working.
Can you please direct me to the right resources, where I can find answers, or answer me here? I try to be more specific if necessary. However, I am not so much familiar with the technical details, some terms are completely new to me and I have to learn.

Hi Roger,
thanks for your reply.

This was the case.
Hm, I'm running Linux. The answers there don't help me much. I'm starting the server again just to test if it happens again.

Hm, so I send a letter with a faked sender's address - what's that? How many letters get sent daily, which have been anonymized? I get letters with no sender's address at all - on the envelope. You never really know from where a letter came, even less now with the letter centers in Germany (stamped in a center which covers a wide region). So, I don't know what's different there compared to tor???
There is currently a very strong attempt in Germany to criminalize the Internet. People try to let it appear as the playground for terrorists etc. The result will be that Politicians have an easy way to pass laws that allow to monitor and control nternet traffic.
Maybe things would have ended differently if you had answered the first letter, because the police investigating the case just need to know what the reason is for things to happen. If you don't explain it, it's most unlikely they will know it by themselves.

Happened to me also here in Germany. I was assumed to be guilty before investigations started, and after investigators (police) had found out that I had nothing to do with the crime I was charged with, I got a notice that investigations were stopped. That's all. Now my files rests in the shelves for 10 years, and I doubt that they will not have an effect if again some doubt comes up about my doings...

The latter isn't right. There are quite a few companies which log the data of their customers and keep it for quite a while. I stumbled over a web page a few weeks ago, where it shows which companies are eagerly following a non-existing law.
Here is a website (it's not the same I saw) which presents an impressing list. Most do not store the data for more than a few days, but in fact they should not do it at all.

That's not entirely correct. It means in fact, that you have to answer inquiries by the authorities immediately. So, if an authorized cop asks you to tell him when a particular person accessed the internet, you must be able to give that information immdiately. The law has already caused a lot of unrest with many ISPs, because to fulfill the requirements of the law, they have to install specific softwares and additional hardware to make this possible, which both are very expensive.
The problem is that anonymisation software like tor can't be run any more if this law comes into effect, because you usually can only capture the IP address and do not know who accesses your node. The law however requires the providers to be able to connect a particular name with the IP address and record the related activities in connection with the name. It's not just additional logging of data. It is much more that would be required.

Agreed. It's impossible to filter out every bad bit, and it will always hit innocent people. I had the police in my house for much less than running an exit node, searching my PC for illegal material, which they didn't find of course - at least enough suspicion was there, totally unreasonable for every knowledgeable person, for a judge to order this investigation. They could have taken my PC and other stuff.
I wonder what would happen if I would run an exit node... I don't want to take that risk. Well, I live in Germany, a country where the government is becoming paranoid and beginning to do exactly what George Orwell has foreseen almost 60 years ago.
I don't know where this will end, but I am currently very afraid of running an exit node, and won't do it. I give some resources as relay node, that's all I can afford to do.
I would like to run an exit node, by the way. There just needs to be some legal clarity on whether and how I could be held responsible for what is going on there. I would even be willing to rent a vserver just for that purpose. But I can't evaluate the risk properly.

this is absolutely ridiculous. I shall not be able to research about the terrorist activities (search string "terrorism"), or the effect of the H-Bomb or other Napalm bombs and what ever other types of bombs there are (search string "bomb"), or the genocide done by Hitler, Stalin and so on (search string "genocide"), or the killing of hundreds (thousands) of innocent people by US military and others? What nonsense is this?
Why not prohibit the internet completely, and the press, while they are at it? TV, radio of course as well, encyclopedias (which also show how an H-bomb is built), yes, all books...
I hope it never gets to the point that the interent is limited to the extend indicated in this article.

I'm not sure if this has been posted already, so I just put in the URL. It's been more or less in line of the current discussions about censorship and so on. I find the sidenotes interesting, like who is using tor etc.

I just would like to request you not to take this discussion off the list, or if you want to do that for whatever reason, to still include me - I am very interested in the reply. I do not think that I am under surveillance, but I know how easy it is in Germany to become a suspect. Until I was visited by the Kripo, I thought that never such a thing would happen.

I (a German) am particularly reluctant to use PayPal. Recently, c't (a German computer magazine) published a series of incidents which shattered my faith in PayPal completely. Further, PayPal informs the police willingly about movements at their end - also abroad. Even though I have an account with PayPal in Germany, US-police obviously could obtain information from PayPal about me. Besides, small submissions (like 1 US$) swallow high fees, that doesn't make much sense.
I am currently into registering an association that was founded more than a hundred years ago - that is quite some work, but manageable. I find the thought to found an association quite intriguing, particularly for Germany, where the members of a registered association (eingetragener Verein) would be protected against legal prosecution. The association could act as contract partners with the ISPs, and as that run Tor nodes which are managed by its members. BTW, one such node has just been set up which is legally registered with an association in Germany and run by a previous Tor-node admin who has also been harassed by the police. But I don't think they will be setting up more nodes.

I am not sure about which association has done that, but I'm in the process of finding it out. I wonder if it would be meaningful to found a German association that is dedicated to that sole purpose of protecting privacy on the Internet - if such an association doesn't yet exist in Germany - and provides Tor servers as well as legal advice for German Tor admins and others who provide similar facilities and are proscuted in Germany.
I'm not sure, I can't imagine they would do it, but I'll ask them.
