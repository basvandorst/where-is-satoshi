@_subject: Tor does not support W95 
The earlier versions forgot to check whether one of the functions called
from crypto_seed_rng() failed. Obviously the call still failed on your
system in those releases, but tor carried on anyway which is bad as it's
wouldn't have been properly seeded.
Which version of Windows 95 are you using? I have used tor on win95 osr2
it works with no problems.
The functions that seed the rng are located in advapi32.dll.  What
of this file do you have? You can check by right clicking, select
Maybe you are using the very first windows 95 release which didn't come
these functions. All you probably need to do is retrieve a later version
advapi32.dll and simply replace your one with it. The updated advapi32
came with Internet Explorer versions. You don't need to install Internet
Explorer, just extract the file from the compressed cab file. You can
find it on many dll download sites.

@_subject: Getting logged out from forums 
Because of the way that tor works when you're browsing, the ip address
that the web server can see will change. Even with cookies enabled, a
lot of web forums will log you out when your ip address suddenly
changes. It's to protect users who might have their cookies copied.
Tor has an option called TrackHostExits that enables it to remember the
exit node used when first connecting to that site, and reuse the same
exit node. This should prevent the forum from logging you out. The
manual explains how to use it.
Should you have two forums that are at  and then you'd add something like
TrackHostExits .phpbb.com,.forum.com
If you want it to work with all hosts, then
TrackHostExits .
