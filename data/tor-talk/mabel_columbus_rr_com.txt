@_subject: Marketing Tor (Was Re: For those using Tor with windows) 
I misunderstood you.  My impression was you have issues with someone
profiting through the use of GPL'd software, not someone profiting by
appropriating other peoples' bandwidth.
I wonder what it would cost.  I pay $0.155 per gigabyte transferred if I
use my whole allocation; this includes my hardware.  So if a user puts a
gigabyte through a 3-node circuit, my provider probably charges it as 6
gigabytes (each node has "in" traffic and "out" traffic) plus some
overhead.  Let's say 7 gigabytes, that comes to $1.083 per anonymous
end-to-end gigabyte.
If I were starting a business of this type [although I will NOT, as I am
too busy], I might consider $29.99 per month with a 10 GB cap.  Cost of
goods sold, $10.83, and gross profit $19.16.  Or a pay-as-you-go deal
with "tokens", although I like the "subscription" concept.
The general public might not squeeze an extra $30 into their online
budget.  But I know one or more people who are eccentric and paranoid
enough, they would be happy to sign up.  That said, trust is an issue
and they would need to trust the provider.
My choice of words was "respectfully disagree".  :)
But here is an interesting design issue.  Many have asked how to
increase the number of volunteers.  Now there are a couple of kinds of
volunteers--some pay the bills using personal funds and can do whatever
they want (e.g. me), and some are accountable to others.
What if the volunteers (at least those who are free to) could choose to
collect a toll?  The DirServers could say, "toll node"... "free node"...
pick what you would like.
I'm quite content donating the gigabytes I can afford, but I could
supply a lot more bandwidth if some of that were sold.  And I know
people whose time and/or traffic demands would inspire them to pay for
their service.

Martin & group,
Interesting observation.  I've never tried a Tor client, so I wouldn't
know.  Two development possibilities come to mind.
a)  Would it help to have a per-connection throttling mechanism?  Not
using hard limits, but a policy which responds to requests from
low-traffic connections ahead of higher-traffic connections?
b)  Alternatively, would it help if torrc prioritizes port numbers?  Tor
might put ssh first, then http(s), then ..., then bittorrent.
...Tor is almost not usable anymore because it is used for p2p traffic.

@_subject: Interoperating with p2p traffic 
Hi Matthias & group,
We'll never stop variant of disparately high bandwidth use.  At best,
we'll level the ground a bit.
And I think that's sufficient.  I suspect that a lot of p2p users won't
make the effort to defeat fairness provisions we may try to build in,
and I believe that p2p developers will ask that their software be used
responsibly (at least in terms of resource usage).
But this is why port number prioritization might also be helpful. Casual BitTorrent users won't stray from the defaults.  Tor's
documentation also can educate them as to the purpose of traffic
prioritization and ask for cooperation on this.
...what about sybil attacks, though, ie. attacks that open many channels
in parallel, impersonating a large number of anonymous users?

@_subject: TOR in Java? 
Hi Oliver,
I'm not a TOR developer; however, as an exit node server operator and
system administrator I prefer C and am willing to accept C++.
C being a closed-source proprietary product, could be very unpopular,
not just on non-Intel architectures but on non-Microsoft operating
systems.  I would not run Tor if it were written in C period.
I view Java as Sun's property; it's an effort to get closed-source code
to work across hardware platforms.  It's extremely inefficient in terms
of computing resources.  There are some terrific turf wars as well, as a
result of fighting between Sun and Microsoft.  Licensing is such that a
lot of OSs don't come with Java by default.  In this sense, I do not
favor Java.  If Tor required Java to run, I probably would discontinue
any affiliation I have with Tor.
Java does have some merit for applets on WWW pages, but that's a
separate topic.
Personally, I don't believe in buffer overflows; my feeling is this
never happens to competent programmers.
No malice intended, and I know I'm very opinionated.  Thank you for
inviting comments!

By "talk through port 81", are you saying that the servers it connects

So many people block port 25 that I'm not sure that port 25 would be a
good choice.
I think there could be issues making the keychains act as servers, at
least by default.  For one thing, Jane Chinese Dissident would have her
IP in the directory of servers; that could be very bad for Jane indeed. Second, this action could increase Jane's traffic and draw attention.

@_subject: Wikipedia & Tor 
I think --
The Wikipedia concept sets itself up for this problem.  The phrase
"anyone can edit" is both highlighted and hyperlinked at
I think it's up to that site to address its concerns, and until its
concept is more mature their only recourse might be to block Tor exit
nodes.  And that is their right!
As I understand, Tor was written to permit anonymous communication
between consenting parties.  Parties who negligently or, like Wikipedia,
intentionally do not authenticate their users consent nonetheless.  It's
not Tor's objective to force anyone into dialogs with unknown endpoints.
I don't think Tor operators should be any more concerned about
Wikipedia's "objections" and allegations of irresponsibility than those
of China, the FBI, or whoever.
Wikipedia's liberal editing policies cause more serious problems than
mere spam and vandalism.  At least those are obvious to casual readers! Some of their articles are riddled with bias and misinformation, often
intentionally written.
I am a big fan of Wikipedia--though I marvel that it works as smoothly
as it does--and I visit there to read just about every day.  I also
operate a Tor server with the default exit policy.  I don't argue with
myself as a proponent of both, and I hope those who are still sore about
this incompatibility will find some peace soon.

Paul's elaboration on my earlier suggestion --
A serious Chinese dissident may want to be reviewed quickly, and I have
a suggestion.  Let her nominate her own reviewer.  So the form works

Verification phrase (optional):       ______________
                                      SUBMIT
The CGI could email this person, saying that an anonymous party has
posted edits to that these edits need a real person to check it out and stand behind the
changes, and that the person added "looking forward to seeing you at the
conference in Sydney next month".
As a courtesy to the receiving party, an opt-out mechanism can be
provided for future emails.
Similarly, there could be volunteer groups with interest in being
notified of submissions to specific pages.

Hi David,
As I understand my proposal, the only requirement of a "reviewer" is
that she is not coming in via a Tor exit node.  The intended benefit is
that the Wikipedia folks hope the reviewer is less likely to permit
damage, as her IP is more likely to be known.
Under this scheme, you could submit edits via Tor, nominate yourself as
a reviewer (which might do nothing except send you an email, as perhaps
anyone who shows up could do this "review"), then you arrive through a
regular connection from a (presumably) known IP and ok your article.
I don't think self-review would be popular, or a problem.  If you're a
Wiki-vandal, you still have to come out from behind the Tor cloud.
If you're a dissident, you would have to step out too.
In the dissident's case, presumably you have a friend who your
authorities can't touch to review for you.  For example if you're in
Beijing, name a supporter in San Francisco to ok your edits.

Hi Jimbo,
My concern about pseudonyms is that they can compromised after-the-fact.
Suppose Li Li is over in China writing blogs, and she selects Muzimei as
her pseudonym and implements it with any of several digital signature
schemes.  Then she writes a bunch of blog entries, and possibly a few
edits to her Wikipedia page.  Wikipedia trusts her because of her
reputation, and presumably no one knows her real name is Li Li.
Except there's an eyewitness to one of her blogs, or the authorities
raid her Linux box and her private key is compromised.  Li Li has a
serious problem, because all of her previous activity is signed by her
Muzimei pseudonym, so after 36 hours of interrogation she confesses, is
found guilty of separatism in an 18 minute trial, and executed 20 days
I still lean in favor of approaches which protect Wikipedia on the basis
of actual content submitted, instead of information about the
submitter.  This is why Paul Syverson and I are advancing these types of
Once again, one way to check content (until machines can "think" better)
is to have not-necessarily-anonymous parties with interests in specific
subjects ok what would otherwise be anonymous posts prior to the posts
showing up.  This system would be only as efficient as these "approving"
personnel for anonymous posts, but these people can be mutually selected
in the sense that an anonymous editor can nominate anyone, and Wikipedia
may refuse anyone.
It's a little like any meeting held under Robert's Rules of Order.  To
discuss anything, someone must present a motion and someone else needs
to second it.  If the content's not pertinent enough for even a second,
there really no need for the group to consider it.  In the mechanism I
am suggestion (as an intermediate-term approach to try), the mover may
be anonymous if the seconder is willing not to be.

I apologize if this question is redundant; I answered many questions by

Earlier this year, tor seemed to leak some memory.  Is this still a
known phenomenon?  I have the latest stable version, built from source,
Fedora Core 1, x86.
I have 256 MB of RAM on a > 1 GHz Celeron.  Resident size about 16 MB,
but virtual size can approach 10 times that within a day and gets over
50 MB within seconds.  I'm not a kernel or networking expert, but the
size does give me an uncomfortable feeling.  Should I be concerned?
