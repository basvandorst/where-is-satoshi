@_subject: [tor-talk] [OT] Secure laptop advice 
Hi. I want to shop for laptop I can trust and ask for your opinions. I see
grarpamp often state  and things like that. But in today reality I
think we still buy AMD or Intel parts and things I dont understand with
new UEFI BIOS.
puri.sm looks like quality laptops and good intentions company ethos but
still using Intel so whats the difference to simply buy $400 laptop and
use linux? Hardware switch for wifi is the only functional difference I
see. What do other people think? What are other manufacturers I can
Thank u

@_subject: [tor-talk] [OT] Smartphone purchase advice? 
Hi, I would like to ask advice for purchase new smartphone. For now I
survive on old android phone with no google account and scrape up some
basic apps from f-droid or other places. It's hassle but it works well for
Minimum is buy some typical Android hardware and use LineageOS (which is
fork of now dead cyanogen-mod). But I wonder, is there better hardware choice? here too we have  putting together custom ethical
hardware but not released yet and is it any different ultimately except
for the hardware switches?
What are thoughts on a usable smartphone purhcase with some
security/privacy and minimal app available (ex: OpenVPN, email,
calculator, web, messaging, phone, camera, camera flash used as a torch,
ssh client, music player, pdf viewer, text/doc editor, calendar, sip
client, alarm clock, of course OrBot........i alsolike one handed Swype
typing but I dont know if there is a modern fork of that, and GPS: well
sometime nice to find myself on a map but its not so important)
Interesting about hardware advice but also concerned for O/S. Are people
excited for puri.sm Librem phone or skeptikal?
Thank u everyone
PS- Is there better place to ask for this kind of advice?
