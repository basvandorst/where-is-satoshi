It's my understanding that Verizon (at least) differs the way it
assigns IP addresses for 4g/LTE devices as opposed to 3G ones.  Is
this a point of concern for Orbot?

As I understand it, 3G devices were assigned a unique public IP.  4G
devices on the same tower, however, share a public IP and VZW uses NAT
(so the device actually has a 10.x.x.x private IP).  This causes some
people issues - for example I'm just trying to understand if, and how, this affects tor usage.
Does it enhance the privacy aspect (because it's tough to pinpoint the
actual device the end-point traffic is going to), or does it degrade
it (because VZW presumably have NAT/Firewall logs that could be used)?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Setting up Tor on Ubuntu 
Let me apologise at the outset for ignoring the TBB.  I plan on doing
so later, but as this is my first experiment with Tor, I would like to
try and educate myself and that means doing things the hard way.
Sadly, the hard way isn't working.
I'm running Ubuntu Maverick with a 2.6.35-32 kernel (not that I think
that matters).
What I've done so far is..
sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list
   Added the repository --> deb
 maverick main
gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv 886DDD89
gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install deb.torproject.org-keyring tor
So far so good.  Tor is running (nmap localhost confirms this).  But
when I try to change the system proxy (to use Chrome), I get no
internet connection - at least I get this error:
Error 111 (net::ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED): Unknown error.
So, then I installed vidalia and privoxy.  Once I stopped tor (sudo
If I start tor from the control panel, I get..
Vidalia detectd that the Tor software exited unexpectedly.
The log file says:
Mar 20 22:58:45.620 [Warning] /var/run/tor is not owned by this user
(spb, 1000) but by debian-tor (116). Perhaps you are running Tor as
the wrong user?
The only search result I can find on Google for this is over 5 years
old.  If I start tor (sudo /etc/init.d/tor start
and then click Start Tor on the control panel, I get
Authenticating to the Tor network
Connecting to the Tor network
And then after some seconds a green onion and
Connected to the Tor network!
However, as before if  I try to change the system proxy (to use
Chrome), I get no internet connection - at least I get this error:
Error 111 (net::ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED): Unknown error.
Can someone help me understand how I can use Vidalia to start Tor - is
this even desirable given that Tor can start by itself?
And explain how I can use the system proxy so that I can use Chrome?

Okay, the error was in front of the keyboard.  When using the proxy
settings in Chrome (which uses the system proxy), I was following the
same protocol as in Firefox - and entering the details in http and
selecting to use for all protocols.  The answer was to enter for the
socks option only.  Then it works in Chrome.
Sadly, that has the consequence that when I fire up Firefox, Firefox
also uses that proxy - whether proxying in Firefox is enabled or not.
That's bad.  Loathe as I am to have a third browser installed, it
looks like I might have to use the TBB for secure browsing instead of
Chromium (which had been my plan.  Firefox is altogether safer and
easier to configure for a higher-level of safety without going torshit
crazy (and it's also useful to have a browser that stores some
So now I have the following questions.
1)  Can I use the TBB even though I have tor installed and running successfully?
2)  Is there a danger in having tor running even when I'm not using it?
3)  I was reading up on exit-point safety and apologies to the people
who spent time documenting it, but I didn't understand that well at
all.  I'm a native speaker and technically literate, so I'm concerned
other people might not understand it either.
4)  Do I need privoxy or obfusproxy?
It's  - which I referenced in my original.

Not to hijack a post - but I had some related questions around this link/post.
Does this advice apply if your torrent client can and does use a proxy
properly?  If so, why?
Does this advice apply if your OS is able to use a system proxy to
route all traffic through the proxy?  If so, why?
If the answer to either of these is that the tor proxy only proxies
TCP traffic, does the answer change if you use a VPN?

Doh!  I thought this had been done as part of the set-up (I thought I
had seen this done). I'll do that.

Thanks.  Dererk's reply means I can probably  go this route.
Additionally today I was reading that simply proxying through
localhost:9050 might not be enough to make FF safe (something about
DNS leaks).
If HTTPS Everywhere encrypts traffic from the exit-point, doesn't that
break SSL?  Or is it working the same way an SSL VPN would work at
that point?
Uninstalled then.
Well, at the moment I don't even have a real need for using Tor - but
you never know.  So, I'll probably install it anyway and see what
gives.  If I can contribute feedback, well and good.
I'm still al little unsure how/why this works.  In my mind it would be
better to have a quantum approach such that (neither) you (nor anyone
else) can determine which hole the light particle goes through.  But I
guess I'll figure it out in time.
Thanks for the help so far.

I'll read it.
I didn't think I was diverting from the packages default behaviour.
But Vidalia sure wasn't happy with/able to start the tor I installed
sudo apt-get install tor
My preference would have to been to find out I didn't need vidalia and
that I could easily run either ALL traffic or none through the tor
network.  An instantaneous "stealth-mode" if you like.
Thanks for the time and input!
