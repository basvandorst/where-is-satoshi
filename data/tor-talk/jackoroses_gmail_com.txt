Bad News..
The hosting provider is still getting take down notices etc and sent me an
email wanting to know what other preemptive actions I have taken or can take
to prevent anymore notices from coming in.
Supposedly the DC is threatening to pull the plug on their server if they
don't do something about my tor node...
So it's looking like a relay or bridge but exit node isn't looking like a
happy future right now..
If I limit my exit ports to http(s) and ssh; would that pretty much stop the
Or does anyone know a good vps hosting company they can point me too?
One that isn't racked in the FDC DC?

Like my subject states just started running Tor and...
Less than a month with Tor running and I have received several DMCA's from
the isp just now..
Sure doesn't take long for those to start flying..
Well I shall see how the host I have the account with responds to the
template provided to us..

Thank you for the links.
My provider replied back and they are happy with the response and have no
with Tor continuing to run.
They have forwarded the response to the DC and told me it will be their call
if they should decide to null route my ip or not..
One notice wouldn't be too bad but I was nailed with what looks like 11 of

It's people like you who seriously affect the existence of exit nodes.
I received quite a few DMCA notices and the next one will surely result in
of my server and the exit node.
Fortunately after taking steps to limit the amount of ports one can use on
my exit node
it seemed to have had great results in stopping or at the very least;
makes it extremely annoying to any torrent users trafficking across my node.
Please reconsider using Tor for any type of torrent activity.

I have been seeing some issues on my end as well but I don't know if it is
related to your
issue or not.
What I have been seeing for the last several days is this.
Jan 28 10:05:52 XXX Tor[504]: Received http status code 404 ("Not Found")
from server '194.109.206.214:80' while fetching "/tor/status/all.z". I'll
try again soon.
Jan 28 10:05:52 XXX Tor[504]: I learned some more directory information, but
not enough to build a circuit: We have only 267/1591 usable descriptors.
Rebooting the server and restarting tor several times has not resolved this
Running tor-devel-0.2.2.5.a still on the server.

I'll take a sponsor for my exit node :P heh
I pay $23 a month for a vps with a 100 Mbs unmetered pipe (shared*) and can
get 1mbs pretty consistently. Coldbot is pretty pricey as Paul mentioned, so
I'd definitely check others.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Phones for Tor 
Don't forget stock android has code contributed by the NSA.
I don't know what code they contributed, don't know if it's in the custom
Don't even know if anyone has truly audited android.
Since I'm not familiar with any apple or droid products and won't anytime
soon, I haven't researched it much.
Honestly I don't think there is any secure smartphone in existence.
The most secure phone is the one you don't own or use.
There are some crypto programs you can install but it requires the other
to have the program as well.
I'd have better luck buying burn phones for people than getting them
to install software and use it properly..

@_subject: [tor-talk] Facebook brute forcing hidden services 
Here is an obvious question that I can't figure out.
Why would you use a service that cares nothing about keeping your details
They'll give you up to the state faster than you can blink.
If you are in a country that blacklists facebook, (china) logging onto
facebook should be the least of your concerns. TOR and facebook don't
belong in the same sentence.
Honestly if I was running an exit node still. I'd just add facebook to
nullroute right now.
