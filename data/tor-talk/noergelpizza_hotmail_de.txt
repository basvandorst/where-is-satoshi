Vidalia, then set up the proxies in the network connections, you will
find the tutorials in the internet. It?s the best to use thunderbird,
because it supports PGP pretty good.

Try openPGP (enigmail plugin for firefox) and if you want you can
organize your keys with kleopatra (you will find it in the Ubuntu
Software Center).

You?re welcome. I meant thunderbird instead of firefox of course.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I read lots of articles and analysis about the ?Bundestrojaner? (that?s
how the german keylogger is called here). It seems like you don?t have
to worry. It is more a virus construction kit than a virus. In
accordance with the Chaos Computer Club they?ll need about 10 experts
working 5 months just to develop and adapt one keylogger. It makes also
sense to install one Linux Distribution. I use Ubuntu 11.04 on my second
notebook, fully encrypted (can be choosen while the installation, just
choose the ?alternate disc? to download). It is much more faster, more
secure and just better then Win7.
If you have to use Windows 7, try the Truecrypt Preeboot encryption. It
is open source software and pretty authentic. With Truecrypt, you can
also encrypt external drives. The most important part of the whole
encryption thing is the password, choose it as long as possible. The
only possibility to crack such an encryption is bruteforce, and using a
long password will destroy this chance.
So far.

Encryption is always important if police or someone wants to analyzse
your drives. As far as I know is the trojan windows-only software, so
you should be pretty sure with an encrypted Ubuntu. Some Investigators
install the trojan by breaking into your house while you are not at home
and installing it manually at your computer. In this scenario, the
encryption would be an extra protection.

Ever thought of the possibility that there?s a virus on that windoiws
computer used to access TOR?
Had the same problem 8 months ago. And I know what I am talking about, I

You can't say how long they need to decrypt anything as long as you don't know which hardware and supercomputers the NSA exactly uses. And we will never know more than gossip.

Wouldn't this question be more appropriate for a crypto specific
mailing list?? Of course you may find that crypto experts may not be
experts on TOR, though they can give you an idea of how long it would
take to brute force an encrypted stream or file, given what resources,
etc.? As for the NSA, they closely guard how many supercomputers they have
and how many they use for decryption.? However, if you are on their
list (the NSA or any government entity), it does not matter how strong
the cryptography is, you can and will be brought in and "convinced" to
divulge anything and everything they want to know.

Some days ago I read that the first usable Quantumcomputing System is on the market. Can some estimate how this possibly influences the decryption of different ciphers?

I would love to see an analysis of a 128 bit AES encryption VS a 10 exoflop
computer. How long to crack it?? Anyone got the math on this?
Andreas, your absolutely right, However we can do some estimating.
Just keep in mind... garbage in, garbage out.. but? this is a pretty good
So the fastest super computers use general cpus and Nvidia k20s. This is
important to note because they scale in a linear fashion based on available
space.?? Now we know that Oak ridge national labs has about an acre of
space, 43,560 Sq. Feet,? for its super computer, the Cray XK7 Named Titan.
Which runs at 17.59 Pentaflops.? (yes PENTAFLOPS)
According to a Cray press release Titan can scale up to 50 Pentaflops.
Now the new facility in Utah will have over 200,000 sq. feet dedicated to
its super computer.
So If we assume, the a linear relationship between Square footage and
computing power then we can calculate that Utah will have 4.59? time more
space then Oak Ridge, so they will have room for at least 80.73
Several articles have stated that the center is designed to house an
Exoflop computer.? Thats a fast computer. Thats 10 followed by 18 zeros. Or
1000 petaflops.
There is more.? Lets look at our growth rate.?? 4.5 years ago Roadrunner
was the first super computer to brake the pentaflop barrier. Today we have
titan at 17.59 pentaflops. So if we can assume a growth rate of 380% per
year.? And that the center will be up graded with each new version of GPU
from Nvidia and CPUs from Intel, We can assume that we will hit one Exoflop
in about three years or 2015.
The power production at the new facility supports these numbers.
So what does this mean??? Any article that suggest that brute forcing
present day encryption is not possible should be taken with a grain of
salt.? While the article may be correct today, come September 2012, Utah
goes on line and we will be stepping into a world that will lead to exaflop
computers and may challenges to our present day encryptions.
AES is safe for a longtime, but other encryptions should be of concern in
the coming years.??? Don't forget about tracking and fingerprinting
possibilities with these massive systems.
I would love to see an analysis of a 128 bit AES encryption VS a 10 exoflop
computer. How long to crack it?? Anyone got the math on this?
The good news, no one is going to care about your stuff... unless your
making waves.?? Then the only safe encryption is a non mathematical method,
such as a? library code run on a system that does not go on the net.

yep, got the same messages.
