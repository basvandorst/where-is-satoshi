Just curious: why don't you use Mixmaster for e-mail privacy?

@_subject: exit node "tortila" adds material to www.barnesandnoble.com home page 
The text is non-sense - seem to be some random lines copied from whereever.
IMHO the JavaScript would have been more interesting to see :)
I'm really wondering, why somebody bothers to add rubbish in such an obvisous way?
My 2c,

@_subject: browser footprint 
The problem is somewhat deeper: you can construct HTML/CSS combinations,
which are
rendered differently by the browsers. Thus you can have e.g. a start
page or a menu which contains different links - depening on the browser
of the user, all but one links are hidden - thus, from the link which has
been clicked you can derive the browser of the user.
You are not using Iceweasel
You are using an Iceweasel compatible browser
The only thing to avoid this kind of profiling is to actually USE
the same browser..

@_subject: US Customers: anyone helping me? 
The poster's mail address suggests that he lives in my vicinity. As at least
I will be at 26c3, I could pick up his hardware there and bring it to Cologne.

@_subject: Tor and Java 
It is already available from SourceForge (OnionCoffee). I guess,
we will migrate the project to the torproject.org repository and
keep a list of bugs/things to fix there.
If you're in an urge to develop, feel free to bug me personally ;)

This is a clone of OnionCoffee. But it's for development/research
purposes only and not for broad usage. However, if you like it, feel
free to help closing its bugs :)

Actually, the talk is based on the PhD thesis of Andriy Panchenko. He'll publish
the detailed results soon. So please stand by for more information :-)

@_subject: Anonymity risks of 2 vs 3 hops 
Just one trivial example is: given that you only have two hop circuits
and an attacker who owns, e.g., four nodes. If your circuit enters the
Tor network he can kill any circuit using any other node than one of
his three as an exit sooner or later, possibly in a way which makes you
believe that it was "just the typical tor way of killing circuits".
This way an attacker can trick you into building a more than
proportional part of crcuits over his nodes.  The same attack would not
be possible, or as easily, with an unrelated middle node.
