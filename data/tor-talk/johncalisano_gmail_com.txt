Isnt the idea to use a DHT for the Intro Pt descriptors for the hidden
services in the long term , is there any move on this front .Ofcourse the
issues with DHt's are all te more well known , GNUnets dht seems very
resilient , atleast thats what they claim.

@_subject: Adding voip to torchat 
I figured the lgical thing to add to torchat would be voip .Is there any
move to that end , can anyone give me pointers as to probable protocols ,
packages that can be ported to torchat .Or how abt getting ekiga to do the
same along with zrtp .???

Im quite ignorant abt onioncat . How was user authentication done in the
onioncat+mumble combination ??
Reading on mumble says its been optimised for low latency , does that
explain the lag ? Mumble has a client / server architecture so was the
server run as a hidden service & the clients just spoke to the hidden
service through tor ??
The torchat architecture seems decentralised to me as every participant is a
hidden service himself & there is no single point of failure.Most voip
clients hav a client/server model which im very keen to avoid.

If u guys hav all the pieces of the puzzle togather then y not put it out in
a simple package :-). Also Id like to kno if ther are/were plans to put the
hidden service descriptors into a DHT .
               Is the mapping  handled de-centrally ? , pls correct me if im
wrong .
           That makes more sense.

Being from a country where phone tapping is rampant & the legal procedure
behind it is opaque I could not contain my enthusiam.I will  also keep in
mind to be strictly gender neutral . If ther is an active VOIP for tor
project I would be really happy to work on it.
think they are maintained in the directory servers now and not in DHT's like
mentioned in the tor-design paper , correct me if I'm wrong .DHTs have their
obvious security issues but I was wondering if people were experimenting
with any designs like the gnunet dht .

What torchat does is a simple authentication ,where A connects to B &
then B connects to A , so that both are sure of the other party, I guess the
same could be done for every other authenticated peer to peer application.

necessarily a fully authenticated peer to peer commuincation where A is sure
of B  & B is sure of A.

My plan goes like this .
1.) Build a barebones SIP client based on SofiaSip.
2.) Support only codec2 ( audio codec )
3.) No encryption is implemented by the SIP client ( like ZRTP etc ) as the
hidden service takes care of that.
4.) Each SIP client will be a hidden service , using authentication similar
to torchat , as it is the most natural way .
5.) Hopefully with codec2 , it can be sent through Tcp , the idea is to keep
the network traffic as low as possible .
Comments & Brickbats pls .

Srry forgot to add . My idea is to create a Voip client optimised for TOR ,
to build a voip client with tor in mind and not getting a client to work
with tor.

exit nodes are the tor nodes from which your traffic leaves the tor network
, the other nodes are the ones through which your traffic is bounced to
achieve anonimity .
 Very well illustrated , &
