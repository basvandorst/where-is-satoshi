@_subject: [tor-talk] Adblock for everyone 
Why you have HTTPSEverywhere and Noscript by default but not Adblockplus on TBB package? it really helps and blcok major tracking companies like Google Facebook ...
Tor is not perfect, as almost all web pages have inserted at least one of these trackers on their page's source, one mistake is enough to compromise our privacy. Adblock solve this problem by just blocking these third parties. another danger of these third parties is FoxAcid codes! Facebook button is the best place for FoxAcid calls. please insert adblock by default on TBB package, if not explain why?
