@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor advice for web developers 
Hash: SHA1
I will be giving a talk at HOPE called Privacy Tricks for Activist Web
Developers. I was planning on including a section about exit enclaves,
how they work and how to set them up on your server. But then I
discovered that they will be deprecated soon:
"Overall the use of enclaves is not advised for these two main reasons:
- - They will not be supported in future versions of Tor (> 0.2.3.x)
- - They do not fit any particular threat model"
So it seems like I should leave this out of my talk.
Is there other advice I can give to web developers and sysadmins who
run websites for activists to make them easier for Tor users to use
