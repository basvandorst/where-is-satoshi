@_subject: [tor-talk] Questions about NSA monitoring of Tor users. 
i agree with your analysis of NSA's job, but not with your statement that
no one denies that its job is legitimate.
on the contrary, while both Snowden and Greenwald, if read carefully, agree
with you (at least mostly), virtually everyone who comments on the Snowden
materials, including some very prominent journalists & bloggers, hackers &
activists & technologists, and many others, strike me as absolutely denying
that there is any legitimate case for not leaving blind spots. i suspect
many on this list deny it too, though I wouldn't pretend to speak for them.
i wish what you said were true, but I see much evidence to the contrary: in
fact, I sometimes think that this is the point.
sense of large black budgets, I'm not sure exactly what you might be
referring to.

Is there any mechanism available by which, e.g., known & trusted editors
could request Tor access for specific login credentials/accounts, and Tor
only allowed for those accounts? This would also help to address Derric's
interest in allowing users from repressive regimes without allowing the
vast amounts of destructive edits that have so far come from Tor. Since
Wikimedia accounts are designed to be at least quasi-anonymous, placing a
request for Tor access through the Wikimedia messaging system should not in
itself reveal one's identity.
so one way to get one of these accounts would be, as many of us do, create
a regular (non-Tor) account, perform a good number of simple,
non-destructive edits (cleaning up already-marked items on WP pages, for
example), and then to request a special Tor account.
maybe if this works for established editors, a trial could be run to allow
a limited number of new accounts through Tor to be set up, again by
personal request, and edits allowed only through those approved accounts,
allowing the Wikimedia software to carefully watch over these accounts for
destructive editing and blocking them if this happens. People would
therefore not be allowed to automatically create accounts in Tor in
Wikimedia projects, nor to edit without logging in, but if the method
works, a certain amount of editing over Tor could be possible.
the overhead in approving accounts would be relatively low, and a limited
number could be created, so that not a great deal of oversight would be
necessary. Perhaps even a secure messaging facility could be created to
request such accounts (if it doesn't exist already).
As long as the basic mechanism is to allow only certain accounts to use
Tor, I presume that Tor itself would make spoofing those accounts
I would presume that a Tor-based Wikimedia account opened solely by
messaging Wikimedia securely would be relatively hard to track down to a
specific individual (especially if it eventually becomes possible to
request these without first becoming a trusted editor), but I may not be
thinking through all the possibilities.

this is extremely interesting--thank you! but would this work for Tor,
since presumably the IPs that are blocked are those of the exit relays?
I am proposing keeping the IPs blocked but opening them up for certain
logged-in accounts--I don't know if that is technically possible, but it
seems like a narrower solution, and also theoretically less open to
abuse/spoofing than unblocking entire IP addresses. (maybe.)

as I've asked before, I would appreciate any metrics, stats, or other data
that can back up claims of this sort, as well as means by which reporters
and researchers can assess them. I am thinking traffic in volume, not
number of applications (not numbers of newspapers, number of drug-based
sites, etc, but how many people are doing it and how much money and how
many transactions flow through them). Based on what I've seen on the Silk
Road and other sites, documents in the Ross Ulbricht prosecution, and my
own research into the size and reach of the global drug trade, I think that
Tor is now a primary conduit for world drug cartels, who practice murder,
violence, and even human trafficking at an almost unfathomable level.
I understand that the Tor community (and Tor's own websites) dismisses this
as incidental or inevitable, but I see many reasons to question this, in
part due to mistaken perceptions of the drug trade as "victimless crime"
and lack of awareness of how drug cartels and organized crime operate.

that's a funny dismissive response, but I think it is a very serious
question, and that it is taken seriously is reflected in no place more
strongly than when people on this list suggest that they know Tor is mostly
used for "good" purposes and that that is (implicitly or explicitly) why
they use or promote it. It is also suggested by the dismissive accounts on
the Tor websites about bad users, many of which I find offensive.
Look at the documents in the Ulbricht case. They are some of the clearest
evidence we have (I mean about what was going on on SR, not what Ulbricht
himself was doing). They paint a disturbing picture.

this would seem to apply only to abusers who themselves are fairly
technically adept.
none of this is Tor- or even "deep web"-specific.
not Tor-specific.
such through OTR-enabled chat, Tor Browser to visit survivor forums safely,
this presumes, as in  that their abuser is technically sophisticated. I
don't doubt for a second that there are such abusers. But I also suspect
they are few in number.
Almost all resources for domestic abuse, and many resources for issues like
transgender people and others, recommend and/or offer anonymity.
My understanding is that Tor is primarily designed to make surveillance by
third parties, especially institutions and states, difficult or even
impossible. That is different from ordinary anonymity that most users do
not have the expertise or willingness to pierce.
I accept that Tor has a very positive use-case in "oppressive" regimes that
block or track certain kinds of internet traffic--though I put "oppressive'
in quotation marks because I think that is a highly subjective judgment
that is much more difficult than the word makes it sound.
I find the argument that there is a significant positive use-case for Tor
in circumstances of domestic abuse--as opposed to much of what you offer
here, education about technology and anonymity in general--much less clear
than I'd like, and the answers so far haven't helped a lot.
As someone pointed out above, the "bad" use case for abusers to avoid law
enforcement--which is much closer to Tor's functional "purpose"--is quite
Believe it or not, I have nothing to do with law enforcement or the
government (or any contractor, etc.; a third-party non-profit non-think
tank research project) and I would LIKE To believe the positive case for
Tor--that's why I keep asking about it. But in my own research I keep
finding lots of both data and arguments that support the "Bad" case, and
the "good" cases keep seeming anecdotal, theoretical, or incidental to
Tor's core functionality.
The people I work with are writing about Tor, and so far, the negatives
keep far outweighing the positives, meaning that the ultimate analysis is
likely to draw negative conclusions. .

I don't know how to parse "say" in this paragraph. It certainly seems to
"say" something about the role of unsurveillable absolute anonymous

whether ISPs and other service providers and websites should let Tor relays
Note that if you are correct, you are painting an extremely dark picture of
our political future, in which constitutional governance and rule of law
become, strictly speaking, impossible. You may think that this will
decrease the amount of evil in the world. My reading of world history
suggests otherwise.
I'm not at all clear why anyone would want to trying to help such an effort
along, unless one has a very apocalyptic view of the future.
Much more apocalyptic than the one in which our extremely flawed political
system continues to be able to operate, and possibly be revised in favor of
better ones. In a world of unsurveillable communications, rule of law and
constitutional governance are over.

It's going nowhere. Name-calling is a remarkable response to my question. I

this list.
Further, I have already made clear that I believe the evidence from the

Tor. I am not "pretending" to be on your side, or not. I am trying to

person. They do not appear to provide support for these statements,

a simple answer that makes sense and I will believe it, or at least report
The fact that this has turned into name-calling and requests for censorship
(go right ahead, I mostly listen and read here anyway), but that nobody has
even tried to explain how they know what "the majority of uses" of Tor are,
or how they know that it is "FUD" to talk about its negative uses, does not
lead me to believe that these statements actually are easy to support.
I am not here to support Tor or to bash it. I am here to learn. I and the
people I work with write things. Sometimes they are critical, sometimes
supportive, usually both. I am interested in facts, not opinions. I try to
report the facts I find.

@_subject: [tor-talk] evidence that Tor isn't "amoral"? 
far be it for me to agree with Juan, but "amoral" is usually taken to mean
"without regard for or understanding of morality": a geeky example would be
Galactus, who devours entire worlds without any real knowledge of who lives
on them, whether they are "good" or "bad," etc. he hungers, he needs to
eat. predator animals can be viewed this way too: the lion doesn't get to
decide to become a vegetarian. "nature" writ large is amoral.
I believe the word you are looking for is "immoral," "doing something you
know is wrong [or even just illegal] & doing it anyway"
one might argue (people do on this list frequently) that Tor itself is
"amoral" (exists without regard to morality), but the uses you and your
friend are concerned about are what is usually called "immoral" (I am not
saying this is true or not true, just talking about word meaning here.)
