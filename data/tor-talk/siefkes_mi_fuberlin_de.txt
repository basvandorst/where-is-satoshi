What would be the purpose of running Tor in a private single-owner network?
The network owner knows who you are and what you do, so unless you know you
can trust them _and_ they won't surrender to legal or hacker attacks you're
out of luck.
You can just skip the Tor part and use a private SSH tunnel such as
Privacy.li, that'll give you the same amount of security.

Well, a multi-owner network would be a different matter. However, I suppose it
would be hard to ensure a fair distribution of money and traffic. (Basically,
how do you make sure that none of the nodes lies about the amount of traffic
it transported, without keeping extensive logs that might endanger the
security of the network?)
They can still be forced to install a wiretap to monitor future traffic. It
has happened in Germany (the JAP case) and it could happen again.
Well, you could try.
I have no idea, I just gave them as an example.
I still don't get how a private Tor single-owner network would differ from a
private SSH tunnel, in terms of privacy I mean.

I don't think so. I checked my mail folders for mails from Hotmail accounts
for the time zones they use in "Date:" and "Received:" headers. German
hotmail.com users always have +0100 or +0200 there (depending on whether it's
summer or winter), which is the correct local time zone. American users tend
to have something from -0400 to -0700. In spam sent from Hotmail other
timezones occur as well, e.g. -0300 or +0400.
Thus I suppose they're really using JavaScript to read your browser's timezone.
Or maybe they have servers around the world and forward you to the one that
seems to be nearest to your IP -- but then Ben should have seen different time
zones when he uses Hotmail via Tor, so that's probably not the case.
A workaround to this problem is probably to switch to another freemail
provider and, if you're paranoid, to turn off JavaScript.

The same seems to have happend to Adam Langley's proposed patch
However, there is hope. At Wikipedia, there is now a proposal for a much
simpler solution which I suppose to be more in accord with Wikipedia's needs:
 .
Things at Wikipedia are moving slow when it comes to policy, but I still hope
they'll reach some consensus which could then be implemented.

I found this document which might have caused an increased interest in Tor for
BT: Maybe somebody from the development team could point out to them that using
Tor for P2P is Not Nice.
Also, I wonder whether their recommended method is secure. For example, the BT
spec  defines an "ip"
parameter containing "the true IP address of the client machine". The field is
optional and I have no idea whether clients tend to set it, but if they do,
users that simply redirect their BT traffic through Tor will be far less
anonymous than they think. Pointing this out on the Tor website might deter
some would-be Tor/BT users.

[trying again -- I sent this message yesterday but it didn't make it to the
list, probably because I used the wrong mail adress. Hoping I got it right
this time...]
It _has_ been coded. Adam Langley has prepared a patch for auto-unblocking,
but so far we haven't managed to get it incorporated into the MediaWiki
software. The patch is available at
 . It is
almost but not completely finished (some FIXMEs in the code due to
insufficient MediaWiki inside knowledge) and by now it's likely to be slightly
stale, but basically it should realize the proposed solution.
Best regards
