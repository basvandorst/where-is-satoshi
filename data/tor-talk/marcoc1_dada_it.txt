@_subject: Exit Node sniffing solution...an idea... 
In this thread I saw no mention of partitioning attack
 problems.
In the past the Mixnet networks that allow several
 visible parameter to be chosen by the user (i.e. Mixmaster)
 was considered vulnerable to partitioning attack,
 that can make traffic analisys easier, lowering
 the anonimity set. The parameters can be some non-default
 remailer properties, some fixed user-chosen chains, or the
 location diversity in Autonomous System domain.
I read that is generally agreed that traffic analisys
 is the main road to attack low-latency systems like Tor.
It is possible that give a lot of hand-configurable
 parameter and stressing the necessity of a personal,
 "smart" choice (exit router enter router forbidden router
 and so on) this can make traffic analisys a lot easier
 respect a no-user-configurable-parameters situation ?
Ciao.   Marco

@_subject: Holy shit I caught 1 
Just a couple of notes trying to clarify this often over-simplified
 world of "bogus" or "valid" certificates.
I don't know of browser that accept troublesome certificates
 without warning; the warning that must be issued by the browser
 are always matter of local setup of browser, maybe of default
 setup of it if user has no changed it.
"bugus" certificates give the impression that are fake
 certificates; they are self-signed certificates, so are
 "valid" by definition. Often there is confusion about
 the "validity" of certificates.
The self-signed certificates that the rogue router show
 are valid but fake; as a fake banknotes they contain textual
 information that indicates not the real but a different issuer.
An authentic certificate by a commercial site is
 normally signed by a commercial certification
 authority.
Ending this boring explaination; when the
 browser open a window about certificates,
 read it with great attention and triple
 check the origin if it is self-signed.
Not all self-signed certificates, or certificate
 signed by a unknow certification authority are fake.
This is often the case of poor organizations
 (as, for example, the Winston Smith Project...)
As always, keep the brain attached.... ;)

@_subject: uptime of tor servers with dynamic ip after every ip change 
But tor itself reset connections after 10 minutes, so one change
 a day is 1 / 144 possibility to drop connection.
Not so bad; the overall network show a far less reliability.
Or I'm missing something ?
Most of new routers will be on dynamic IP, so their
 contribution is important.
IMHO, of course.  Ciao.   Marco

@_subject: Tor & dynamic dns 
I have online several nodes that use xDSL lines with
 dynamic IP and fixed names using dynamic dns.
When the associates modem/router change address after a disconnection
 (common situation on italian xDSL lines, that disconnects daily
 or more often) the host  update his name without stopping tor. In the torrc there is the FQDN, not the IP
I noticed that such nodes appear and disappear often
 in the serifos statistics
despite the fact that they are always reachable, usable and
 present in the tor directory.
Must I restart Tor each time the IP change ? Or do something
 else ?
Or this effect is due to different reason I haaave not understood ?
Thanks a lot.   Marco

The router is just fine, and on 9030 it still giving directory

@_subject: Tor Server on Live CD? 
Me too.
I saw no big problems but IMO two questions
 need to be answerd before.
1) how many time a live-router will be
 coninuosly online (mean value)
I noticed that when putting a new router online,
 the maximum load is reached after 3-4 days
This can be a problem if the live-router
 is shutted down more often.
Is this long time an explicit feature
 of router algoritms ? If this
 is the case, can this time be shortened?
2) The router seems to perform better
 when registered on dirservers..
If this is true, and not only my
 sensation, this can be solved being
 a live-router a "short-lived" one ?

Unfortunatly this is true for other well known software too;
 Freenet is the first example I can think of.
Just to close this OT but interesting thread I2P appear
 a mess from a licensing point of view.
If I'm not wrong, to solve the impossible task to put
 together the licensing of various code snippets used to build
 I2P, the main code is unlicensed, i.e. in the  public domain. Someone know if this is true ?

Hi, there is a privacy village, but seems to be a very german oriented
Anyway I hope to be there, and maybe some other from PWS will be

I agree with your post, both the point of view of implement
 this new feature in Tor (beware from partitioning issue, however)
 and the need not to overreact.
But I strongly suggest to discuss more and warn about using the
 600+ router from China.
Consider two facts:
1) mout are born in few weeks
2) all of them are exit router, no other
 country has more than 50%
Add them and add a very small quantity of paranoy.
German situation is that of a nation full
 of crypto hacktivist that mus face a new
 law in two year
China (and another country maybe) are
 a Big Brother with certificate of authenticy.
mMybe a little press coverage on this is due.
A lot of naive Tor users think that those
 are chinese dissidents, reallly!

The right question is "What the Chinese government
or TLA's can do controlling at leat the 25%
of network?"
For example, CN has comlete control over 1/64 of
 Tor network traffic, or abour 2%.
I understand that Tor has a lot of crypto in place  to defend against rogue nodes, also when they are acting
 cooperatively.
I understand also that too much configurable
 options in Tor can be problematic, from  a programming, a debugging, and a partitioning
 attack point of view.
But I Would be very happy to have a
 fuckNodeByCountryCode= in the
 config file. Guess my favorite value ...

Interesting, but the board hos a lot of unneded stuff (VGA, Audio).
Soekris 4801 is comparable but headless, both provider
 are a little vagie about power consumption, but
 in theory Soekris seems less power hungry.
There are models with more muscles (5501) too

@_subject: What do you think about this exit policy for germany? 
Good recommandation, I agree, but almost impossible to follow
IMHO only privacy and civil right organization are eligible,
 and in Italy there are very few, and normally not interested
 in technology. No way, at least for me.
The normal pattern of a contact for this activity  when I contacted a candidate organization is
1) you find a person that can decide
2) you talk to him, explaining the fact and normally
 have some interest in return
3) suddendly the person understand that sooner or later
 someone will say or write that he is helping terrorist
 and paedophiles
4) end of the story
Someone has a success story ?

@_subject: New Tor routers in specific countries 
I periodcally check the tor network status here
This is only a snapshot, not showing the evolution in time
(any source for this info is avalaible?) but
I was impressed by the evolution recent in US, Germany and China.
The german situation, considering incidents, new laws and
 other facts can have opposite explaination, for the bad,
 the good or both.
The US is of difficult interpretation, but the China is
 definitely strange.
Any fact or opinion worth sharing ?

@_subject: Switching to 2.x 
I never see here (my fault?) any discussion/suggestion
 about how/when/why switch from Tor 1.2.x to 2.x.
Someone can point me to any resource or give some information ?
Many thanks.   Marco
