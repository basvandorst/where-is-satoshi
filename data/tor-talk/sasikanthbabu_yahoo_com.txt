No, Google does not block tor.? It happened to me as well with error messages "intrusion detected" and "insecure device".?I had to modify Google security settings to make it work.

I've seen the "intrusion detected" message and also "insecure device"
messages from gmail. It would seem that ip addresses not normally
associated with your account (because Google keeps great records of
your online activity for you) may trigger the message. I don't believe Google is intentionally blocking Tor.

Get involved
  Hello
I am a third year undergrad Computer Engineering student from Pune
Institute of Computer Technology, India. My area of interest is in
Networking and Network Security.
I would like to get involved in Tor Community by contributing for Tor in
GSoC 2015. I have been actively using Tor so far and would love to be a
part of this wonderful project. I would like to know about the ways in
which i can contribute for Tor development as a part of GSoC 2015.
