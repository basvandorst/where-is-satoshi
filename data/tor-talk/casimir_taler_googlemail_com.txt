@_subject: [warn] Error creating network socket: No buffer space available and  
since yesterday I'm running an entrynode on a virtual server. In my
tor-logs I have a lot of these messages:
[warn] Error creating network socket: No buffer space available
I looked in the tor-wiki
( for a
solution to this problem and took a look at my beancounters file:
resource                     held              maxheld
barrier                limit              failcnt

You see I have no problem with the limits which are described in the
wiki-article. My problem is the value numtcpsock:
resource                     held              maxheld
barrier                limit              failcnt
numtcpsock                   1792                 1792
1792                 1792                31240
Is Tor openeing more than 1792 Sockets for working? Or is there some
problem with closing opened sockets? Because my node is now running 14
hours and in the first 8 hours this limit wasn't hit!? At the moment
I'm therefor just relaying about 600-700 KB/s but I have a faster
connection. Is there something which I can do against it?
