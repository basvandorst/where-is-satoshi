@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Bundle 3.0alpha1 test builds 
This is also the case with tor-browser-linux32-3.0-alpha-1_fa.tar.xz -
no text is displayed on the first screen that opens after running the
program, and both the 'connect' and 'configure' buttons are blank.

@_subject: [tor-talk] EntryNodes breaks new alpha TBB? 
I emailed one of the developers about this but it seems fairer to ask
the group.
Is there any reason why setting an EntryNodes configuration in the torrc
for the new alpha TBBs would prevent the browser from opening at all?
This is the only part of the configuration I have altered. The loading
dialog opens up fine but it sticks either on first opening or at 'Asking
for relay descriptors' during the loading process. Removing that setting
makes it work again.
Grateful for any help with this.

I solved my own problem - the relevant log sections are these:
Jun 17 x:16:45.000 [warn] Failed to open GEOIP file ./Data/Tor/geoip.
We've been configured to use (or avoid) nodes in certain countries, and
we need GEOIP information to figure out which ones they are.
Jun 17 x:16:45.000 [warn] Failed to open GEOIP file
avoid) nodes in certain countries, and we need GEOIP information to
figure out which ones they are.
I can only think to fix this by putting the relevant files where TBB
expects to find them. There was a similar problem for me with the last
alpha release. Does this have implications for the recent forensic
testing of the bundles (that is, the presence of Tor files outside the
bundle), or is it only a problem for me?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Vidalia with extra geolocation 
In the photo on this page  Dr. Murdoch
is pictured standing in front of a much nattier version of Vidalia than
the one that ships with the stable browser bundles. The relay
geolocation feature seems to be much more detailed than the one
currently offered.
Is this available anywhere? Or was it purely for some demonstration purpose?
