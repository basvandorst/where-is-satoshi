@_subject: Question about the vulnerability 
Forgive my ignorance, but when exactly does the Control Port come into play? Is a Tor user who simply uses Tor in client mode vulnerable? I've seen the Control Port info in the man pages but that doesn't really answer my question - can anyone advise?

@_subject: Question about the vulnerability 
Roger, thank you for your response - I did follow that thread when it came out and upgraded my systems. The question I have is not really about the vulnerability but more of a general operational one - in what situations is the control port actually used? If I am not running a Tor server but using Tor in client mode, does the Control Port get used? What is it used for? Thanks again for the great software....looking to do more with it  -Nd

@_subject: contradicting log entries regarding ExcludeNodes 
OK, so probably showing my ignorance here but if you want to exclude a server that is not yours, is there any way to get the "key" information for that server or is that sensitive to the owner of that box?

@_subject: Privoxy usage? 
Question - if you are only connecting to encrypted remote resources by IP address, do you need to use Privoxy? Scenario: VPN client-side gateway that is pushing traffic through Tor to a VPN server at a destination known to the VPN client by its IP and not by DNS. Tor not being utilized (on this circuit) for any web surfing, etc - do the exposure risks still exist?

What vendor would you suggest?

@_subject: Privoxy usage? 
I have heard of the "TCP over TCP" issue but have not had any bad experiences so far. I am currently using both TCP and UDP-based VPN systems and while the TCP-based one is a bit slower, it still seems very stable for applications such as Terminal Services, FTP, http(s), etc. I do notice problems with some apps (FTP for example) if I'm trying to use a TCP-based connection over a satellite link - lot of TCP RSTs and "Zero Window"-type errors in the sniff though on some satellite systems even UDP-based tunnels don't seem to work very well for anything other than low bandwidth applications.
Thanks again...Nd

@_subject: Directory servers for a subset of Tor routers 
Question, is it possible to set up private directory servers and make available only a portion of the available Tor routers? For example, if you only wanted to make routers that were online in the U.K. or France available to users who got their info from these dir servers, can that be done? I know you can set entry and exit nodes but this only addresses part of the question and is too static for this example. I've seen some info on Blossom but don't know if that will do it either. If it can't be done or there are other problems, does anyone have any other ideas or suggestions?

@_subject: Directory servers for a subset of Tor routers 
Thanks Comrade - so blocking connections from other countries...is that something that is built into Tor or would I need a 3rd party solution? I think i already saw how to prevent the dir server from advertising itself to the rest of the Tor network in the man pages (yeah, really wouldn't want to screw anyone else up) but not so sure on the geographical part.

@_subject: Tor and HTTPS 
Sorry if this sounds a bit stupid but looking for some clarification. I've read that using HTTPS over Tor actually reduces your security due to the bypass of your local proxy (Privoxy, etc) -
 is this the case for all usage or does it justs affect hidden services? For example, if I am accessing Hushmail via a Tor-enabled Firefox browser, is that traffic not protected by the anonymized circuit or otherwise less secure than a connection to a port 80 web Thanks -nD

@_subject: locating hidden services 
Hi again,
Learning about hidden services - what are the methods (if any) for Tor users to locate a hidden service? Is there a way to search for them, get the info from the directory servers, etc? Say for example that I have a web server running as a hidden service and I only want people from a certain group to be able to locate/access that server. Authentication has already been addressed on the server but I don't want users who are not part of that group to "bang" on my hidden service with a bunch of bogus login requests.
In the past, I've used port knocking/SPA to address this issue but I'm not exactly sure how that would work out in a Tor/Hidden Service environment - anyone have any experience along those lines? Any other information or advice?
Thanks as always - nD   Live the good life! Click now for great retirement planning assistance!
