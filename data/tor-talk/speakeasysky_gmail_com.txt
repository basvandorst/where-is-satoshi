I just have to check, is tor secure yet?
I was thinking it might be more secure with these AI based timing attacks
now if the number of hops is more adjustable. Although I would like to see
a means of negotiating a layer between a hidden service or exit node using
multiple connections in rendezvous as well, splitting data up in both
directions between multiple tunnels that could be specified and juggled in
and out of queue at random..
Let me know if this helps.

Yeah.. the concern here is that it's so feasible now that an attacker can
correlate packet timing with a smaller portion of nodes and with the advent
of high speed internet I think it would be beneficial for people who would
like to adjust settings on their routing as such to be able to.

I'm not sure why that would be an issue when using StrictNodes 1 with
ExitNodes. It would be interesting to make a list of any nodes that are
exibiting the wrong behavior and exclude them with ExcludeNodes.

Also try listing the nodes by fingerprint.

Consider using a vpn to connect to from tor. Consider paying in crypto.
Consider ssh tunneling on port 443 for convenience and interoperability or
use a hidden service. Consider that they are doing it on purpose.

Right well I suppose I can see this as a system of routing anonymously to a
key. I was just wondering about using tor ostensibly as a network interface
module and I suppose it could be compiled as a library elf and other
applications can be made for working with certain aspects of tor and
passing structures through ipc.

So can you tell me is WM caused by shortened telomeres and a cell not
triggering apoptosis and instead replicating rapidly? And can that be
treated by extending telomeres?

I mean for example historically the people of Canaan worshipped God but
Canaan was cursed. And it was about the place of the Hittites and
Canaanites who were slaughtered. But they worshipped the same God.

It is like they are saying they want the apocalypse without saying it by
really saying it (anonymous) that's their way of asking, and christians who
are good christians and israel says "yes come Lord"

Interesting the elites have a spear campaign going on against Israel
Killing al-Najjar, who clearly posed no threat to its soldiers, made it
difficult for Israel’s army to argue that its snipers targeted only
“rioters” in Gaza and did not fire indiscriminately at peaceful protesters,
journalists, and medics.

I was just wondering since the NSA has quantum computers that can break
ECDSA (As they have stated they could break bitcoin in an interview, and
telecomix unlocked Cameron's hard drive.) When is Tor going to be upgraded
to post quantum?
Can we at least hack together an interleaving of RSA and ECDSA with some
secure number of rounds in the interim?

honestly, ideally it would be a lot easier to do things with tor if it
actually internally followed the unix philosophy and the layers of service
could be used as a part of the linux system and modular use of the parts. I
was just looking at BGP routing over tor. I'm not sure how to do that with
the current implementation over hidden service. I'm having a hard time
working out how to use it as layer 2 and encapsulate things over the
network from one hidden service to another. But i also understand the whole
system is not well funded. I'm glad it has progressed as far as it has
since I had first looked at all of the various deepwebs in 2007. At least
we no longer have to set up privoxy and worry about dns leakage.

S7r I generally agree with you there. There is no evidence that it has been
broken. Thus we can only go by what these agencies are saying or hinting
about their capabilities. I certainly don't think that in this case it is
required and must negotiate with post quantum cryptography, only that as a
feature a client may require that for all of their tunnels unless it is
found to be flawed.
We know that ecdsa is weak against a quantum computer, as well as rsa. The
only evidence I can provide is publicly available:
The NSA stating they could break crypto with their current tools
(specifically the weak ecdsa used for wallets) and that they won't and use
the tools for "other things" which immediately makes me think of Tor.
The only other evidence I can submit as a need to upgrade encryption in
general is the government issued that they will no longer use key lengths
below 3k rsa, and require at least 4096 for top secret information.

Okay, a little more grounded, about the Utah datacenter in 2012:
"The NSA project now aims to break the "exaflop barrier" by building a
supercomputer a hundred times faster than the fastest existing today, the
Japanese "K Computer." That code-breaking system is projected to use 200
megawatts of power, about as much as would power 200,000 homes."

Now whether or not all of this power consumption is a coverup for the
quantum capibilities of the NSA is a matter of speculation, but the fact of
the matter is they are breaking encryption and they did spend $2 billion on
a datacenter for that sole purpose.
