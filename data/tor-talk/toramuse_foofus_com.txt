@_subject: [tor-talk] actions taken against bad nodes 
TOR operators are voluntarily offering bandwidth for transit, and users
are voluntarily using that transit for free with no contract of any
sort. I'm curious under what laws and in which jurisdictions would someone be
able to prosecute an exit operator for altering traffic that they're
essentially transiting with no guarantee of fitness.

Um, running TOR nodes to help keep a free internet alive.

Also please create tor-toughtalk@ so people have a place to go be
needlessly abusive and not have to justify their abuse with facts. Thx.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How do you configure a Tor relay on Windows? 
Forgive my presumption, but if your friend isn't capable of running
their Windows box going forward, do you think it wise to get them
involved in running a TOR relay which might draw attention their way?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Making TBB undetectable! 
Having a unique, or unique enough browser fingerprint would allow
website owners and content network providers to track a TOR user across
nodes and/or sessions. With a large enough CDN (facebook, etc) you could
reasonably de-anonymize a user.  Maybe I'm not understanding you, but given that all TBB users are
already distinguishable from other users since their IP address is a
Tor exit, I'm not seeing how TorBrowser having a different fingerprint
from other browsers is a problem. The important thing is that
TorBrowser users have the same fingerprint as each other, which the
TorBrowser devs seem to be doing a good job on.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Exit Traffic classification and discrimination 
Hi Fabio:
TLDR: No, I haven't and wouldn't try this.
If I understand, you're asking "Why don't TOR operators discriminate on
traffic by passing packets to popular, acceptable sites and
discriminating against traffic headed "elsewhere" by re-routing it.
This view ignores a few fundamental facts underlying the very existence
of TOR.
1) That tools such as TOR exist specifically to enable that last 10% of
"dangerous" traffic - given that every political regime gets to decide
what they think is "Dangerous".  In Saudia Arabia, criticism of the king
is dangerous traffic. In China, discussion of the Tienanmen square
massacre is also dangerous. TOR exists specifically to facilitate this
2) That the most objectionable traffic will probably be going to a lot
of the top-30 websites, as that's where political discussions need to be
brought to gain any sort of critical mass to bring them out of anonymous
online enclaves and translate them into real political activity.
Finally, I wonder whether you have any experience actually, in practice,
trying to differentiate traffic as "abuse" from "not abuse". If there
were any even close-to-accurate ways of doing this, I suspect ISP's
would already be doing it and even your abusive TOR traffic would get
dropped at peering connections.
In practice, it's very difficult to tell if even "clearly abusive"
traffic - say, XSS attempts or SQL injection scanners - are abuse by
some annoying hackers, or research by someone trying to assess how many
home IP cameras are vulnerable to being part of a botnet, or even an
authorized pen-tester just checking out their client's distributed offices.
