I don't think this disclaimer is strong enough. With the 'getinfo address'
command, malware doesn't even need a colluding relay.

Isn't corridor exactly what that article is describing? It seems like
it's also vulnerable to the 'Severe issue' in the article -- a
compromised tor host behind corridor can get its public IP address with
the 'getinfo address' Tor control protocol command and deanonymize.
Whonix includes this in its threat model -- you should be able to run
arbitrary/compromised code behind the tor gateway and be safe. Can
corridor do anything about it?
