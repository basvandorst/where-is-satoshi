@_subject: Which signature to use? 
This is probably a stupid question but which public key do I use for verifying the download? I downloaded your keys from keyserver.net but they are all DSA keys and while verifying the signature gnupg tells me that it wants RSA key ID 8D29319A. Unfortunately I don't seem to find the key on any keyserver.

I could get your key off keyserver.net and I imported it into my keyring but I did not get Nick's (0x165733EA) of the keyserver.
When I verify using gnupg (gpg --verify tor-0.0.9.4-win32.exe.asc) I get the following error
gpg: Signature made 02/03/05 23:33:29 Central Standard Time using RSA key ID 8D29319A
gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found

The SKS server given in the page mentioned by Roger retrieved Nick's key, which, it turns out, was used for the signing.

@_subject: Tor and Google Image search 
Whenever I use google image search via tor the search page serves up
empty pages. Without tor google image search behaves as it normally
does. Does anybody else face this problem?

@_subject: Tor and Google Image search 
I think I should have been clearer. When I do a search for a term, say
"tor" I get the search results page with all the hits, but the thumbnail
images which should be present in the results page are not there and
instead there are the broken image links. If I click on such a link then
I am taken to the next page where on the top there is the thumbnail
image and below that is the original page (context) where the image is
It is only in the search results page do I see the broken image links
and not the thumbnails.

So does that mean that if I am trying to access an SSL enabled account
(say gmail or yahoo e-mail), the certificate is a spoofed one being
provided by the rogue tor node and therefore my login name and password
are therefore being provided in cleartext to the node operator?

Thanks for the explanation Roger. So your advice is that I shouldn't be
too worried about this since Firefox (or a useful extension like
Spoofstick) would warn me about the spoof?
Does that mean also that the security issue found by Mike Perry can be
solved easily by just taking care that the SSL certificate is provided
by website you actually want to use?

@_subject: Help with privoxy on Virtual Privacy Machine 
Hi All,
This may be the wrong mailing list but I could not find any mailing list for the
virtual privacy machine and since it uses tor and privoxy maybe someone here
can help me with my problem.
I tried to setup the virtual privacy machine according to the instructions at
Initially I tried using the dsl-2.4-embedded version. After the installation and
running the "install.sh" script I shutdown and started dsl again. There was an
error during restart
libpcre.so.3: cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory
I got the same error with dsl-2.1b-embedded.
As the wiki says all applications do connect through tor. But I am unable to
start privoxy.
Can anybody point me to a distribution of the virtual privacy machine which
contains libpcre.so.3?
