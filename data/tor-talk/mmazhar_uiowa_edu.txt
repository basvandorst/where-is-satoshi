@_subject: [tor-talk] Onion Service introduction point selection 
I am looking into Tor onion services as part of my research, and am interested in how an Onion Service selects its introduction points, in particular where in source code does it do so. I am aware of rendservice.c in the source code, but any pointers are welcome.
Please move this mail to the requisite list if required.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden service intro point cycling 
So I am looking into hidden services as part of research, and I am wondering whether there is any advantage into cycling your intro points(i.e. changing them to new ones) aggressively over time. Advantage here could be either for performance reasons or anonymity reasons. For services that do not need to be themselves anonymous(e.g. Facebook, DuckDuckGo), would cycling intro points help in performance?
