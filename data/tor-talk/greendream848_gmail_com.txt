It's possible if you're willing to edit the source code and build Tor
yourself, but it's not advised.

Thank you for running torstatus.blutmagie.de.
I'd like to second the request to make available the source code. I'm sure
there are many qualified people here with the resources to continue
offering this service in the event you are unable to do so.
I don't think the stats attachment made it through (at least, I'm not
seeing it in my client or in the archives).

Of course it's up to the owner to provide the source or not, but Olaf said
he might just shut the service down. It would be a shame if the service
vanished (or optimistically, someone else recreates it but they have to
start from scratch).
I don't care where the service is hosted, I just would prefer it stayed up.

I still don't understand how such relays can gain a high consensus weight
so quickly (in 1 or 2 days) without help from the bandwidth authorities.

Nothing works reliably on Tor Weather. More importantly than the free
t-shirt, it doesn't notify you when your relay goes offline either. :(

That doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Cicada_3301 is going on 5 years.
Seeing as no entity has stepped forward, there is no marketing benefit. For
that matter there's no tangible benefit for the sponsor at all, aside from
possibly attracting talent.

Interesting. Any idea what they're able to enumerate with the modified
version of Tor? Can the Tor network be hardened from this client-side

@_subject: [tor-talk] onion routing MITM 
Well, I'd query duckduckgo for its hidden service URL in the clearnet
first. If you just search "duckduckgo hidden service" on their clearnet
site, there's a magic/onebox answer with a link to the official onion site.
The larger point is valid though. I feel like this is actually a huge
problem with the current state of hidden services. Try figuring out which
.onion site is the "real" Hidden Wiki for example.
I'll admit I barely use hidden services for this very reason.

There's no easy way to do that on the server/Mailman side. You can usually

Why are you saving the user IP addresses? Your privacy policy says they're
saved as a salted hash, but why store this at all? It seems fairly
unfriendly to user privacy to have a database of fingerprints AND
associated IP addresses sitting around.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why does parameter "StrictExitNodes" exist? 
By default (i.e., StrictNodes is false) Tor will bypass your declared
ExitNodes if it needs to do so in order for traffic to reach its
destination. Imagine the scenario where all the exit nodes in your
ExitNodes criteria have strict exit policy and they have no way to route
your traffic to its destination. With StrictNodes set to True, Tor won't
ever look for another exit, and this traffic won't be routable.
Going from memory, don't quote me. ;-)

I don't mean to be dismissive of the problem, but correlation does not
imply causation. In other words, how do you know the issue was from Tor?
Isn't it possible a hardware issue or other software could have
coincidentally caused the problem?
Anything in the Windows system logs?

I'd also be very concerned about the security implications of running a
(very!) outdated OS. The OS/2 Warp image linked by the OP is 10 years old.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and suggest there might be some vulns there.

- You're confusing obscurity and security.
- "NSA backdoors" are not the only type of vulnerability.
- Security in software design has come a long way in the past 10 years.
- If this is for a relay, the security impact could be to ALL users of the
Tor network.
Despite the snark at the end of my earlier email, I stand by the general
security concern.
