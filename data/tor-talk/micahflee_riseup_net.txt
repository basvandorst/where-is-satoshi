I already posted about this in tor-dev, so if you're on both sorry
about the repost.
Tor Browser Launcher is a project I've been working on to make it easier
for GNU/Linux users to securely download, install, keep updated, and
launch Tor Browser Bundle. It's just about ready for a first release, so
try it out and post any bugs you might find to github!

Just want to jump in and say that Freedom of the Press Foundation
starting using CloudFlare to fend off a DDoS attack a couple months ago
and we've never had a single complaint from a Tor user not being able to
access it.
I've tried visiting  over Tor myself
several times and have always gotten through.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Mail service requires "java script enabled" 
There isn't much risk of identity leaking by enabling javascript in your
browser. The most javascript should be able to do is fingerprint your
browser profile to detect plugins, fonts, etc. By using the Tor Browser
Bundle rather than just a normal web browser proxied through Tor, most
(with the goal of all) of these fingerprinting attempts are mitigated.
So I think it's perfectly fine to enable javascript for Yahoo mail. If
you're going to be using Yahoo mail, make sure you turn on SSL:
There are definitely security concerns though, the biggest being using
javascript on a website that someone else has discovered an XSS bug on.
And browser zero days are much more likely to be exploited through the
use of javascript, etc.
That said, these days there are serious usability advantages that
javascript provides, especially for sites like Google Maps. If done
correctly, it can be used to *increase* security in some cases (such as
the payment processor Stripe's use of ajax), and it can be used to make
content load faster and use less bandwidth, such as Twitter letting you
load only recent tweets without refreshing the entire page. And many web
developers build javascript functionality and don't bother to make it
work for NosScripters, which is annoying, but sometimes the
functionality they're going for is impossible without javascript.
Javascript is kind of the future of the web, and it's only going to be
more prevalent as time goes on. And unlike in the 90s, it's genuinely
useful now, not just for adding bling to your site. Rather than be down
on javascript, I think it's more production to figure out ways to make
javascript more secure, like:

Javascript should actually already be enabled. TBB comes with an add-on
called NoScript that blocks javascript except for for specific sites,
but it's default setting is to allow all javascript (NoScript has other
security advantages too).
So either NoScript is actually blocking javascript on yahoo.com and you
need to make an exception to allow it, or you've disabled javascript in
your Firefox preferences somehow.
If NoScript is the problem, when you go to mail.yahoo.com, you should
see the NoScript icon just to the left of the address bar. Click it for
options. There should be an option to "allow scripts globally" to set it
to the default TBB behavior, or at least "Allow yahoo.com" to just allow
javascript on yahoo.
If the problem is that you somehow disabled javascript in the browser
settings, you can click Edit -> Preferences, go to the Content tab, and
make sure "Enable JavaScript" is checked.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor 0.2.4.8-alpha is out 
Are there plans to release the Tor Browser Bundle as a package in Tor's
official repos, e.g. This would make keeping an up-to-date TBB much more convenient.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB as a deb (was Re: Tor 0.2.4.8-alpha is out) 
I kind of like how TBB is distributed as a bunch of files in a directory
and it gave me an idea for a very simple way to package this as a deb.
The package would include the latest TBB tarball and a launcher script.
When you run the launcher, it checks to see if ~/.torbrowser/$VERSION
exist. If it doesn't, it extracts TBB into it. Then it runs
When a new version of TBB comes out, the update would just have a new
TBB tarball, and the launcher script would be adjusted to include the
new version number.
I read through both tickets about this on trac.torproject.org, and I'm
not sure it will satisfy everyone, or be allowed in Debian, but I think
it's a good start. It does, however, avoid the problem where Debian
users could have a different fingerprint than other TBB users, and
doesn't require there to be an iceweasel-src package. And it's really
I went ahead and implemented this as a kind of sloppy proof-of-concept:
Here's the really simple launcher script:
It totally works. I even added a "Tor Browser" application launcher that
uses the TBB icon. Thoughts?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Bundle .deb packaging solution 
I posted about this the other day but I think most people missed it.
I've come up with a working solution to packaging TBB in a Debian repo,
so that people can apt-get install it and easily get regular updates.
Here's the bug: Make a deb of the Torbrowser and add to repository
You can git clone it and run "equivs-build torbrowser" to build a .deb
to install.
The deb package contains the latest TBB tarball and a launcher script.
It also contains a "Tor Browser" application launcher that runs this
script, so users can open Tor Browser from their desktop environment's menu.
When a user runs the launcher script, it checks if
~/.torbrowser/$VERSION exists. If it doesn't, it extracts the TBB
tarball to there. Then it runs ~/.torbrowser/$VERSION/start-tor-browser.
Releasing updated versions is simple. The update would include a new TBB
tarball and the launcher script would include a new version, so the next
time a user runs Tor Browser it will extract the new version in their
~/.torbrowser dir.
Thoughts on this approach? I'd love to see it happen.
There's another related bug: Get TorBrowser in Debian
However I don't think this could end up in Debian without some changes,
since "The Debian policy states that a package should not contain any
embedded code copy. So simply shipping the result of TorBrowserBundle
build is not an option."

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Bundle .deb packaging solution 
Right now no one owns the bug in trac, so I don't think anyone is
thinking about it: I have limited time and I'm not sure I want the responsibility of being
the TBB deb package maintainer, although it shouldn't be much work since
all the real work happens in the TBB tarball. I'm more than happy to
help develop it.
Do any devs want to own this ticket and then I can help implement it? Or
are there issues with this approach of packaging TBB that I'm not seeing?

Does this ever actually happen?
This is a good point. Ideas below.
This is simple enough to fix. The update script, or even the launcher
script, can clean up old versions.
Neither does the current update method for TBB on Linux, which totally
sucks. Being able to at least update with the package manager is a great
However, I was thinking about how to deal with this. I think it

I started updating my git repo to deal with this, but ran into some
snags. I'll try more later when I have time.

If you want more than one TBB at a time you won't be able to install
them from the package manager anyway. This is true of all software. If
you want to run more than one apache2 server at the same time, you'll
need to do it manually.
I think it's fine to not worry about this edge case for packaging TBB.
People who want to do that can of course still do it manually.

Hey Mike, I have a question about filenames.
The 3.0 alpha1s are all hosted here for now?
But soon (maybe Monday with your blog post) they will be here too?
Tor Browser Launcher's auto-updating works by loading and parsing
 and then uses that
string to build the full URL of the .tar.gz and the .tar.gz.asc files to
Right now the latest alpha version is "3.0-alpha-1-Linux", so TBL is
trying to download this URL:
But that's returning a 404 error for now, because the 3.0-alpha-1s
aren't in  yet. But
even when they are, it looks like the file naming system has changed.
TBL expects these:
But it looks like the new files are in this format:
They're also .tar.xz files instead of .tar.gz files. When they're
uploading directly to torproject.org/dist will the file names remain in
the format that TBL is currently expecting? And do you think it would be
possible to only update RecommendedTBBVersions when there's an
associated tarball available for download in a predictable place so that
we don't get into a situation where there's an updated version but TBL
can't find it?
And 3.0 looks great btw!

Doesn't TorButton regularly check RecommendedTBBVersions for updates and
if it sees there's a newer version, then prompts to update? If you just
upload the tarballs but don't update RecommendedTBBVersions, won't
TorButton not realize there's a newer version yet?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Anonymity of Leaking Servers (Was Re: [tor-dev] 
There are a couple of other reasons why even an org like the New Yorker
might want their document upload server to be anonymous.
If an attacker knows the IP of the upload server (and can make web
requests directly to the IP, as opposed to the .onion) they can DDoS
them without bringing down the Tor network.
Also, if a government knows the IP of the upload server and it's in
their jurisdiction, they could potentially raid the data center and
seize the server.
I agree, most of the time leak sites don't need as much anonymity from
hidden services.
