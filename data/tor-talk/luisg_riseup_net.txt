@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Browser Bundle with Chromium 
What are the reasons that makes building a Tor Browser using Chromium
not such a good idea? I recall reading somewhere that while making a Tor
Browser with a Chromium base would have its benefits due to Chromium's
superior security model (i.e. sandboxing), there are "serious privacy
issues" that would have to be solved to make that possible.
My question is what are those issues? What is preventing someone from
digging out all the Google integration and possible privacy-endangering
features and making a Tor Browser Bundle out of it?

Hash: SHA1
Yes the newest version of the Tor Browser Bundle uses Firefox 31 ESR
which uses Australis. The latest ESR release of Firefox has to be
used, or else the Tor Browser cannot continue to get security updates
to the underlying Firefox code: it's not about anyone's preference to
any UI.
Continuing use of an out of date version of the browser bundle is
dangerous, because it would bare security vulnerabilities that would
go unfixed. There is an Add-on that restores Firefox to the older UI.
You can install it so you can get the UI you prefer again while still
using the most up-to-date version of the browser bundle, and won't
have to go without the security updates.

Riseup Networks has been getting DDoS'd sporadically these couple of days, this probably explains the outage of their dir auth.

@_subject: [tor-talk] reject Hulu in exit policy 
More than likely, Hulu just indiscriminately blocks Tor exit relays. I
doubt blocking Hulu from your exit policy would help with anything. Nor
will contacting them I'd bet; companies are always very finicky about
adding exceptions for people.
