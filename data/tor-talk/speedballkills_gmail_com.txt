@_subject: Chroot TOR as explained on Wiki error 
Well, i followed instruction to chroot TOR as explained at No errors occur untill the test step where i got :
       debian:/home/user/tor-0.1.2.18# chroot $TORCHROOT /tor/bin/tor
       chroot: cannot run command `/tor/bin/tor': No such file or directory
Execute $TORCHROOT/tor/bin/tor works fine...
Any ideas ?

Well, i got "the solution"
The reason was pretty simple... (as often...) In fact, the << cp `ldd $TORCHROOT/tor/bin/tor | awk '{print $3}'` $TORCHROOT/lib >> command didn't copy on of the essential librarie in the lib directy, i had to locate it then copy it myself into the lib dir.
Thx anyway for tips.
