Is this bug found also in 0.2.6.10, or only in 0.2.7.5?
Are users of 0.2.6.10 (as this is still the stable version; 0.2.7.6 is listed as unstable) encouraged to upgrade to 0.2.7.6?
What does "weaker anonymity" mean exactly? How big is the risk? Can this bug lead to deanonymization?
Thank you.

I'm just wondering if users that rely on maximum anonymity should switch to 0.2.7.6, given it is still an unstable branch.
I don't want to use torbrowser because of three things.
1. As I understand, torbrowser allows only browsing the web. I use tor mainly with protocols different than http.
2. I have a tor node constantly in network, which is better both for the network and for me, as I believe that there might be greater risk of deanonymization by correlating when the node is up and when my network activity takes place.
3. I have tor on one machine and all stuff that uses it on another machine. Tor machine obviously has access to the Internet, while this "user" machine has access only to the tor machine with a dedicated interface. Access to anything other than tor socks port is externally blocked. This way, even if some bug in browser (or any other program that I use with tor) causes it to leak anything, I can be pretty sure that my external IP address will never be exposed. This approach is similar to the Tails approach.
Thanks, I will read it.

How many relays with guard flag are there? What is the percentage of relays with guard flag set in population of all relays?
Recently there was a bug corrected ( when all relays were treated like entry guards, while only relays with a guard flag should be treated like entry guards. Correcting this bug obviously made "entry guard pool" smaller. Can it make correlation attack easier, as now the attacker has a smaller pool (only relays with the guard flag) to consider and it's more probable that client will connect to a relay controlled or observed by the attacker?

Hash: SHA1
My current setup is fairly simple. Let me introduce some consistent naming - - server - my server (VPS) in the datacentre
- - router - a router in my home, it has a private VPN connection to the - - tor PC - a PC on which I browse tor
Currently tor client is running on the server and tor PC accesses its socks port through the VPN. All other Internet access from the tor PC is blocked on the router, so no leaks are possible. Tor PC has only one, internal IP.
Advantage is that in case of a raid, it would be done in the datacentre before raiding my home.
Major drawback is that it is possible for the attacker to hack into the server (or just seize it invisibly, as it's only virtual) and sniff on the localhost between the VPN end and socks port.
I've been recently thinking of different approaches.
1. Maybe I should run a private (unpublished) bridge on the server and a tor client on my tor PC, that would be able to connect only to the bridge (through a VPN)? This way, all unencrypted traffic would never exit a tor PC. This PC is secured enough to assume it's secure from being hacked into. It's also encrypted and never left unattended.
Additional question: if a tor client connects through a bridge, does it need to access other servers (like directory authorities) directly, or it would work if I give it access only to the bridge?
I'm a little scared of bridges, as they don't use guards (yet?) and they are less popular than traditional relays, so bugs in them are more likely to exist.
2. Maybe I should run a tor client on a separate machine in my home, between my tor PC and the router, and route all traffic from it through the VPN, so it would look like it originates from the server? This way all unencrypted traffic will still be inside my home and I would avoid using bridges.
3. Maybe I should modify point 1, but publish the bridge address? I'm tight on my bandwidth and I don't want to run a relay, but maybe this way, as the outgoing traffic originating from me will blend with outgoing traffic originating from other using my bridge, it would be more plausible to deny my activities if someone launches a correlation attack? They would have to correlate traffic entering and leaving my bridge with traffic on the exit node (or rendezvouz point, or any node in the path from an exit service to it), while in case of a client (or a private bridge), it would be sufficient to correlate the traffic on a guard (for client) or a middle node (for bridge) with the traffic on an exit node...
I'm much more concerned with anonymity accessing hidden services than with anonymity accessing clearnet services through exists, by the way.

And what about a client that connects only with a bridge? Does a client connect anywhere else besides the bridge (or bridges) that are configured in this client?
My threat model is law enforcement, government and my ISP. I don't care if ISP at my datacentre sees that I'm using Tor, but I don't want my home ISP to see it. Also, if I have an option, I'd prefer my datacentre server to be seized in case of anything rather than my home equipment.
Of course I don't want anything to be seized at all.
So option 2 from my list...
Another question is if it would be better to run a client only when I'm active on Tor, or use a client that is constantly connected. I feel that activity done after client startup (downloading consensus, building circuits) could be correlated with my Tor usage timeframe somehow, that's why I have a client running constantly now.
You mean routing VPN traffic through Tor? I didn't even consider it, as it would give no anonymity anyway...
Aeris :
So you recommend manually specifying an entry guard, instead of letting Tor choose? Why?
So you're opting for option 2 from my list, too.

I used a different approach - I used Socks5Proxy option in tor and set up a small socks proxy on a server that listens on the VPN end (using ssh with -D option). So my tor on home router listens on its SocksPort and communicates with the external world using another socks proxy through the VPN. I filtered all other traffic.
Seems to work for now...
My PC is not turned on 24/7 (router and server are) and as I mentioned before, I prefer to have a client constantly running, as I don't want to give out a correlation between time of starting the client and time of my Tor activities.

You're right...
I have one more question. What are the drawbacks of not preserving Tor state directory between reboots? I reboot the router rarely, but it can happen from time to time. I run Tor from ramdisk and I don't want it to have any persistent storage - I want it to vanish completely as the router shuts down.
One drawback that I see is that after every reboot, a new entry guard will be selected and it can make correlation attacks easier. Maybe it would be wise to copy old state file during each "Tor deployment" process (by which I mean creating the ramdisk and copying Tor over the network to it from a secure machine)?

Rejo Zenger :
There should be a possibility to automate this process. Something like...
1. HS owner realizes that his HS key has been stolen (but he still has his copy)
2. HS owner creates the "revocation message" for the onion address, signs it with his key and submits it to the DHT the same way a HS descriptor is uploaded
3. This revocation message, once received and confirmed that it belongs to the owner of the specified onion address, cannot be cancelled or undone. The address is marked as "bad" forever. Alternatively, to avoid cloggering the network, it could be marked as "bad" only for a certain amount of time (a year?) and during the validity period, the owner should reissue a new revocation message, or else it will expire
4. All relays with HSDir flag should keep in their DHT (the ones with hidden service descriptors) also these revocation messages
5. When client tries to download a HS descriptor from a HSDir relay, it will receive the descriptor, but it will also receive the revocation Now it all depends on the client:
1. Client too old to understand revocation message will ignore the message and connect anyway
2. Client with a default configuration will verify the signature of the HS revocation message and if valid, will refuse to build circuit to HS introduction point (and log this information)
3. Client with a special configuration flag set (IgnoreHSRevocations or something like that) could log the revocation message, but build circuit anyway, at the client owner risk
Any flaws in my idea? I see two:
1. What if Tor on HSDir relays is too old? They won't process this message properly. Maybe we should have a new flag for revocation message directory relays and use it instead?
2. What if someone tries to fill the DHT with malicious revocation messages? But it can also happen with normal HS descriptors...

I already see some flaws in my solution, so forgive me for answering I think it should be done by Tor after putting a directive in torrc below HiddenServiceDir. Something like:
HiddenServiceDir /some/dir
HiddenServiceRevoke 1
Better idea would be to publish it exactly as HS descriptors are published. I don't know the validity period of a HS descriptor, but it should be periodically refreshed as long as Tor is running (just like HS descriptors are - are they?)
Of course only one Tor instance would be sufficient to revoke all HS descriptors, published by the attacker who stole the key.
Of course, the attacker could post his own revocation message, but he would only do everyone the favor by doing so.
Maybe it would be better to check client version (does it send its version when asking for HS descriptor?) and in case the client is too old and a valid revocation message exists, refuse sending this HS descriptor.
The signature should always be valid, as it is checked by the HSDir relay, but the client should do its check anyway (because HSDir relay could be Of course logging with the usual "[scrubbed].onion" text.
Bad idea, as all clients would then need a separate circuit to the revocation directory just to check the revocation message and it would slow down connecting to all hidden services.

Let's assume that attacker (government) seizes the hidden service and wants to run it and deanonymize its users with traffic correlation.
Attacker could easily tap into major VPN providers traffic and try to correlate their traffic with hidden service traffic. And there are fewer VPN providers than Tor entry guards (and much less than home connections around the globe).
Does it mean that routing Tor through a commercial VPN could actually lower the security, compared to routing Tor directly through a home connection? It's in contrast with what many say, that you should use a commercial VPN for extra security.

Yeah... and considered that there is no known method of breaking the anonymity of circuit, but correlation attacks are known and any realtime anonymity network without some kind of noise injected is susceptible to them, I guess one should fear correlation more than breaking the circuit anonymity and minimize places, where one's traffic could be correlated with HS (or exit node) traffic and traced back to him...
So, with this assumption, running Tor directly from home connection should be safest, right?
I wonder how many entry guards are monitored, by the way, and if correcting bug 17772 didn't make it worse from the surveillance point of view, as now there are much fewer nodes to observe...

It wouldn't. Traffic correlation doesn't care of the traffic content itself. It doesn't break the traffic anonymity, it just correlates your traffic with the traffic on the site you're visiting, regardless of nodes or encryption layers in between. I guess that there are methods to calculate a probability based on correlating individual packets. Later it could be used in court, like "we're 99,99999% certain it was him".

Definitely not, that's why I was thinking of a VPN in a jurisdiction that allows keeping no logs.
But even if a VPN provider keeps no logs (and even if I trust them, and as HideMyAss case shows, it can be dangerous), I think that if government in any country wanted to tap into traffic in a datacentre where this VPN provider hosts some of its servers, it wouldn't be too hard for them to do I trust Tor way more than I trust a VPN provider...

Let's assume that a global adversary sets up (or seizes) a hidden service with illegal content and wants to deanonymize users who download this content from this service.
Users are educated, use only trusted, newest software and have all plugins We all know about traffic correlation attacks. But let's take it further.
Let's set up a service in a way that it will modulate the traffic, so the download would look like:
Few seconds - maximum traffic speed
Few seconds - download completely stopped
Few seconds - again, maximum traffic speed
Few seconds - again, download completely stopped
Then, we monitor traffic flowing into various entry nodes (remember we're a global adversary, having direct access to infrastructure around the globe) and spot the traffic that matches our pattern.
Traffic fluctuations are normal and common, but fixed sequence of interrupts in proper times is absolutely unique.
Seems possible? Seems probable?

Well, for one traffic hiccup probably many. For constant interruptions in specified time frames, probably not many, if any. I mean, if you download a file that is big enough to cause many of these interruptions, I think no other traffic would meet this pattern.
Some observers will realize and stay safe, but some people will not realize and get caught...

Actually, I blindly told what the site admin published:
"I strongly suspect it's the highest traffic site ever to exist on Tor. That's why it's gotten so expensive to run, we use close to 100% of a gigabit internet port much of the time, pushing well over 6 TB of traffic per day."
I'm not sure if it's true (and from what you say, it seems it's not), but the site is very active anyway.
A couple of users recently noticed this repeatable pattern during downloads. From what they told, downloads from this site were always smooth and, although the speed have always been fluctuating, it rarely stopped completely, and even if it did, it was random. Now, when it occurs (because it doesn't occur every time), it occurs perfectly To quote one of the users: "Yes, speed can vary, it is normal and observed everywhere in Tor, but it is NOT frequent INTERRUPTS. Normally speed changes monotonically, so if interrupt happens, it happens only after the speed decreased to just a few KB/s. If speed is perfect, very high, and then sudden interrupt happens, it is very warring sign. This may be new FBI technique."
The only evidence I have is how the site started to behave, and what the users noticed.
When this load balancing algorithm starts to work? When it is used (to balance load between what and what?), and what can be the reason it started to behave that way only recently?

First, thank you "notwith" for your input. At least I'm not alone...
Sorry for replying that late, but I didn't have time to look at this issue during the week.
I have a few new facts.
1. If I limit the transfer rate in a client to a small value (I tried 5 kB/s), the download is stable and interruptions do not occur.
2. In my test without transfer rate limiting, interruptions were between 7 and 10 seconds long. They always happen on the Tor side, never on the socks client side (it seemed obvious, but I checked it anyway).
3. The last data packet, received from Tor before the interruption, is always larger than other data packets (about 6-10kB instead of usual 1024 bytes), but not all large packets cause interruptions.
4. The first data packet, received from Tor after the interruption, sometimes contains 498 bytes (twice, actually) and sometimes the usual 1024 bytes.
Could it shed some light on the subject?
Full dump, from SYN to FIN, can be found below. SEND are packets from my socks client to the Tor, RECV are packets from Tor to my socks client. It was a small (interrupted by me) download, but with larger downloads it looks very similar.
I separated interruptions with empty lines for clarity.

Mike Perry :
Yes, I agree. But the attack is very probable here.
Only with hidden service traffic from this specific service.
Unfortunately, only the site admin could confirm, but I don't see him here (he has been notified of this thread).
Actually, as I don't know the site admin in person, it would be possible that the site admin is already in jail and the site is being run by LEA, inserting these interruptions deliberately. But for now let's assume it's not true.
If it is an attack, I strongly suspect it's targetting users of the specific hidden service.
Yes, definitely.
It would have to run within a realtime scheduler to completely block Tor for several seconds... very few applications use this scheduler, at least in Linux.

Yes, I know the URL, but (as notwith already said):
1. The site contains content illegal in many (most?) jurisdictions.
2. The site needs registration to access anything, and the registration is now Therefore, I think it would be best not to post the link, at least not on the list.

Yes, it's true and it's another problem to deal with. I don't know what (if any) measures admin took to protect himself. Maybe the site is hosted in a jurisdiction where the site content is legal, who knows.

Okay... it was the problem on my side. It has been classified as spam, but it's not a problem... I thought that downloading email with pop3 will download it from all folders, not only from inbox, and that spam will just be marked as *** SPAM ***. I never used riseup webmail before, so I wasn't aware that these messages just wait there in the spam folder, inaccessible with pop3.
I switched to imap and download from both inbox and spam folders, and these messages go into spam, because:

a) allow receiving mail through pop3 or imap over tls (or tor hidden b) allow sending mail through smtp over tls (or tor hidden service)
c) be tor-friendly (my current provider blocks some tor exit nodes when I try to send mail through it)
d) have a good reputation (emails sent from it won't be classified as e) don't filter incoming emails in any way
f) be anonymous and free or payable with scrypt-based coins (litecoin, dogecoin, etc.)
Do you have any recommendations?

Yandex is Russian and I don't know Russian, is there a way to switch it to gmx.com doesn't want me to register: "Your registration could not be processed at the moment. Please try again later."
gmx.net seems to blacklist Tor, too:
   Registrierung leider nicht moglich!
   Sie haben versucht, sich mit der IP-Adresse 77.247.181.162
   bei GMX zu registrieren.
   Diese IP-Adresse ist nicht zugelassen.
Whatever it means, but it looks like "you are using Tor, so flick off".
- From the link provided by nusenu:
Sigaint doesn't allow pop3/smtp unless you buy a pro account, which is quite expensive...
mailbox.org allows only 30 days for free.
riseup.net is the provider I'm using currently, but I'm not happy with it and that's why I'm looking for another one...
mail.ru is in Russian, too... any way to switch to English?
mail2tor, according to the site, is not very reliable.
bitmessage.ch doesn't seem to allow creating custom addresses.
Doesn't look good, maybe it's time to learn Russian...

Hmm, I don't need extra privacy or security, a "normal" one would be enough :)
Anyway, I noticed that bitmessage.ch allows creating a meaningful alias to give out to people, so I registered there, gave the address to some people I talk to with email and I'm currently testing it. Seems promising...
Riseup silently drops email with certain words in the subject. I have notified them and I'm still waiting for the response.
Thanks, added to my "to do" list if bitmessage turns out to be unstable.
Actually I'm more concerned with government criminals... but I hope that PGP encryption with a 4096-bit key will keep them away... because if not, then what else will?
Thank you!

Sure. I'd prefer to encrypt it though, at least for now:
