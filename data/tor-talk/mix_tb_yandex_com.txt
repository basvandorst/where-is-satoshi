Nice. I didn't even realise that MixMinion was still a going concern.
Some very early feedback ...
DNS and other connections leak during account creation (when Thunderbird
is trying to work out how to connect), but after that I can receive
(IMAP w/STARTTLS, IMAPS) and send (Submission w/STARTTLS, SMTPS) without
seeing any leaks, including no DNS leaks. I can also see the connections
showing up in the Vidalia Network Map.
When sending via IMAP (even when using STARTTLS) there is a pop up to
notify you that you're sending in the clear, and the warning goes away
when you switch to IMAPS. No such warning appears when using Submission
w/STARTTLS. (Or when using SMTPS, as expected.)
This was all performed using a clean Thunderbird 12.0.1 profile, no
other addons, 64-bit Debian 6.0.4, Tor Browser 2.2.35-11 with a static
SOCKS port.

I wonder whether tsocks could be distributed with Thunderbird, and a TBB
style startup used to load the libraries and force Thunderbird through
Tor that way?
I didn't see the Message ID as harmful, but I'm more than happy to be
educated on this front. I do see the timezone leakage as a problem. I've
had a look through Thunderbird's settings and can't see anything to
indicate that this is stored within the settings so I imagine that this
comes from system. If it's controlled through the environment then it
may be able to be set before running, again maybe through a TBB style
My only other immediate concern is how Thunderbird identifies itself to
the SMTP server during the EHLO. Claws mail provides a dialogue to show
what it's doing, and also allows you to specify what it is that is
reported to the other end. I'm not sure what Thunderbird says, but it's
likely that it is the local hostname.

Thanks for the info. I'll have a good read through this over the next
few days.
Trying this now just to see what it looks like.
Happy to help.

Nope, auto generated, just like in this one. I've checked
mailnews.reply_header_authorwrote and it's set to "%s". I imagine that
this is the way it should be, but it's not working as expected.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB Linux 32bit | 2.2.35-12 | OpenSSL to 1.0.1c but 
I'm using the same:
$ ls
$ md5sum libssl.so.1.0.0
d774c0f5ea0762271a814fecdf921c97  libssl.so.1.0.0
If I run strings on this version of libssl.so.1.0.0, then on the version
distributed with 2.2.35-11, and then diff the outputs it looks as though
it has been updated:
< |$0;}
< D$(;D$8

< DTLSv1 part of OpenSSL 1.0.1c 10 May 2012

So it looks like the update has occurred but the names are the same.

Mike Perry:
Just the Message-ID from what I can see. No leaks detected with tcpdump
(DNS, IMAPS, SMTPS). Can see the connections going through the Vidalia
Network Map.
None of the network.protocol-handler.warn-external* settings seem to
force a warning, but I haven't tried the suggestion below:
Plus, as noted previously and demonstrated above, it's just the author's
name now listed as specified in mailnews.reply_header_authorwrote.

Sukhbir Singh:
All appears to be working well from TorBirdy. But there are a few
unexpected happenings from within Thunderbird (Debian 6.0.6, 64-bit).
All occur at start-up, regardless of how settings were left when closing
+ Message pane is on
+ Quick filter is on
+ Thunderbird won't check for messages at start-up, even though the
option remains enabled
Are these design decisions? Or unexpected side effects?

Sukhbir Singh:
No reason to close them, I was just expecting them to remain in the same
position as they were when TB was closed, like regular TB. Not a big
problem, just unexpected.
This was the one!
Thanks. I can see why this could be better, and now have the option to
explore some more.

Hi Sukhbir,
Sukhbir Singh:
Yes, clear now. When selecting 'Local Folders' (default) you get the
same experience each time. When selecting "Select last accessed mail
folder on startup" you get something more like the standard TB operation.
Thanks for the clarification.

I've had no problems running the same binary with different profiles,
one with TorBirdy and one without. I haven't been able to observe any
leaks. I use Linux and run Thunderbird something like:
Unlike Firefox, --no-remote doesn't seem to be needed under Thunderbird.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Risk of checking multiple accounts with TorBirdy 
The exit node admin should only be able to see which email services you
are talking to, not the address you are using (assuming end-to-end
encryption). An even then they are only going to see it when you exit
through that node, which should not be all the time.
So worst case is that they can see three simultaneous connections to
different providers, not which addresses are in use.

Yes, I was considering your threat model of a malicious exit node
administrator. Collusion or a global passive adversary is far more
You could try separate Thunderbird profiles with only one account per
profile, or you could turn off checking at startup and checking every x
minutes and then just check manually. You could also use 'fetchmail' and
a small script with 'cron' or 'at' to randomise which accounts are
checked and how long the break is in between. Using separate profiles
would mean that an adversary may be able to see patterns of when you are
actively checking email, while a fetchmail setup running on an always on
machine would make this far more difficult.

Have just tried this and am not getting expected results. Modified the
TBB SocksPort line in Data/Tor/torrc-defaults from:
  SocksPort 9150
  SocksPort 9150 IsolateDestPort
but I'm still seeing multiple connections to the same port (993) through
the same circuit with multiple accounts from the same Thunderbird
instance. I'm also seeing multiple simultaneous connections to the same
port (80, 443) from TBB as well.
I used IsolateDestPort instead of IsolateDestAddr as we're talking about
separate email providers. I also tried:
  SocksPort 9150 IsolateDestAddr IsolateDestPort
and I'm also seeing the same destination ports being used over the same
circuits, as well as the same destination IPs. Maybe I'm doing something

@_subject: [tor-talk] How do I separate/isolate Tor streams in TorBirdy 
If you have multiple accounts in Thunderbird and they all check
immediately then they all use the same stream.
