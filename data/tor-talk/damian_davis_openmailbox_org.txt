Roadmap aimed for the first, "alpha, no OTR", versions to be done by March 31, 2014.
The Daily Dot wrote "so TIMB can have its first release in July".
According to both sources an early version of TIMB should be available somewhere, yet I was not able to find it.
Therefore, what's the time-plan-status for TIMB?
