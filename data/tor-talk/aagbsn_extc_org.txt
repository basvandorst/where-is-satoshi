If you must have GMail, I've noticed that accounts created on android
devices are not subject to these checks. And yes, even when using Tor
via Orbot.
You don't have an android phone? The following works too:
1. Install the android sdk/emulator and create an avd. I tested with
API 8 (android 2.2) + google apis
2. launch the emulator: emulator -http-proxy  (the proxy settings in the gui did *not* work for
3. verify tor is working via 4. navigate through settings->accounts&sync->add account->google->create
5. solve captcha
6. profit

Actually, Android is an open source project:
And also other derivatives:
You can run Android on a phone without google proprietary code, though
most phones sold are google branded and bundled with proprietary apps.
I do think it's ridiculous to need a cellphone to get a webmail
account. That said, there are a lot of competing providers. What I
don't understand is hating on Google but still wanting to use their
webmail service.
The android emulator can be found here:
It does run on the 3 major platforms.
adb_name is a typo, I meant to say avd_name -- for 'android virtual device'.
I don't have any idea how this works. If anyone is interested in
poking into this I suggest adding a self-signed root CA on a device or
emulator and use sslsniff + wireshark to see what is going on.

The workaround is for creating new accounts; not for receiving SMS
verification of existing accounts (unfortunately).
If you need a throwaway number for SMS there are a number of VOIP
services that might be useful and could probably be purchased using a
prepay card if you want to do it anonymously.

One thing you could test is adding your existing google account (one
pending SMS verification) to the android emulator and see if that has
any effect. It's pretty much the same process I outlined before,
except hit the 'add existing' option rather than 'create new'

when you create your avd there is a list of api versions. if you do not see
listings that include '+ google apis' you may need to download those - see
'available packages' and make sure you check at least one of 'Google APIs by
Google Inc. Android API ...'
I used version 8.
This should add the option to create a google account.

GetTor e-mail autoresponder
GetTor is a program for serving Tor and related files over SMTP. Users
interact with GetTor by sending it email.
Finding GetTor
It is assumed that a user has a method of finding a valid GetTor email
robot. Currently the best known GetTor email is gettor @
torproject.org. This should be the most current stable GetTor robot as
it is operated by the Tor Project.
Requirements for using GetTor
Users communicate with the GetTor robot by sending messages via email.
The messages are currently English keywords.
Using GetTor
Currently, users have a limited set of options. It is best to send an
email with a message body (the subject line can be blank) that
consists of only the word 'help' to receive instructions. This will
send the most current set of choices. An example reply to a request
for help follows:
  Hello, This is the "gettor" robot.
   I am sorry, but your request was not understood. Please select one
   of the following package names:

@_subject: [tor-talk] general request: Port blocking and developers? 
Software development:
Well, as a developer I mostly use ssh or https with git, and don't run
services on home ISPs or ISPs that block traffic. If I discovered my
(hosting) provider was doing something like that and unwilling to
change it, I would switch providers.
Application design/deployment:
One of the things we encourage relay (and particularly bridge)
operators to do (if possible) is to listen on common not-blocked ports
(80, 443). Aka, port blocking is braindead and doesn't work (hence DPI
right? The arms race has long since evolved past simple port
Yes. **Do Not Block Ports** unless **specifically requested**.
Blocking and filtering of chatty network fileshare protocols,
broadcasts, etc should be done at the CPE and it should be
configurable by the user (though sensible defaults are a fine idea).
Anything else is censorship.
And since I mentioned DPI above; the same applies. If the network
cannot handle customers using it at a given price point the business
model is broken. I don't buy any of the arguments for DPI as traffic
management since these providers have had years to meet capacity
requirements and plenty of countries have symmetric FTTH at 100mbit+.
Claiming that they need fancy censorware to keep their creaky network
running is ludicrous.
P.S. I think the bigger issue here is that since most people have a
very limited choice of providers, they pretty much have to live with
the crap options they are presented. That applies to national ISPs and
associated governments as well.
The fact that these people meet to discuss how to filter/block/control
the net rather than improve it is rather telling.

This is a thought I've also had. There are some missing parts (namely,
Tor circuit control) that don't yet exist, but intend to add in the
future. There should be an OONI test template (see ooni/templates) for
tests that need to interact with Tor.
Some other things to address:
* how are exits selected for testing? From an input file? Or Tor consensus?
* how are the output reports formatted? What data is included? Where
are they submitted?
* Who runs the tool? Would it work like the current BwAuth, where a
DirAuth and BwAuth operator pair up, or could anyone report BadExit?
This sounds like a project needing a proposal (see tor-spec.git if
you're not familiar). I'd be happy to collaborate, if anyone is
interested in going this direction.

Great! Is the source available anywhere?
It would be great if the operator of this service provided
instructions for replicating their results, so that other volunteers
can help out. Getting multiple independent reporters is a big step
towards automating BadExit policies.
There is no existing automated mechanism for giving an exit the
BadExit flag, SOAT reports and independent reports get emailed to a
list where a directory authority operator or a volunteer could
manually review the reports before manually adding a BadExit line to
the directory authority's torrc.
There is a proposal for an automated mechanism in:
Section: 3. Automatic BadExit Marking
That's just the beginning of the fun. It's a big project, that could

While it may be an arms race. I don't think it's as bad as you might
think. For starters, there's a lot of low hanging/high reward fruit --
just two volunteers running BadExit scans collaboratively would be a
huge improvement.
This isn't likely to work either, as bad exits can wait arbitrary
amount of time after passing any tests before attacking clients. I
think it's preferable that tests are unpredictable, periodic, and
looks as much like a real user as possible.

@_subject: [tor-talk] "Safeplug" 
I agree with the market analysis aspect, but I am concerned on the following points:
1. No source or design documents are provided.
Despite making use of open source software, and linking to the relevant open source licenses here:
 (whoops, a dead link), there are no design documents published, additional contributions or source linked anywhere on the website. If I wanted to contribute a patch, where would I do it? Not providing source for the device is pretty weak -- plenty of other projects, such as Tails and Whonix, have implemented transparent torification and provide extensive documentation and code.
2. Router Registration
According to  you must click on the following link to activate your device.
The link isn't https, and redirects to a page asking for billing information to *buy* a device. I don't have a Safeplug, so I don't know if the page would look any different, but it does imply that they have the ability to differentiate between a Safeplug user and a regular Tor user (me). That smells bad.
3. Automatic updates
Not only does this imply that the device must phone home and uniquely identify itself (see, router registration), it also means that code can be pushed to the device. I'd say "against the operators consent", but you agreed to that, in the TOS:
As part of the Service, you may from time to time receive updates to the Software from Pogoplug that may be automatically downloaded and installed to your applicable device. These updates may include bug fixes, security enhancements or improvements, or entirely new versions of the Software. You agree that Pogoplug may automatically deliver such updates to you as part of the Service.
5. TOS
Pogoplug isn't an ISP, and I've never seen a router force a TOS on me before. And, it's one of those nasty ever-changing TOS that assumes if someone actually read it once, they will want to read it again:
Pogoplug may update or change these TOS from time to time and recommends that you review the TOS on a regular basis at  You understand and agree that your continued use of the Service after the TOS has changed constitutes your acceptance of the TOS as revised.
6. Torified Everything and Anonymity Profile
Roger and I had several long talks about the design behind a theoretical Tor Router product, and one sticking point is that although the easy way to do it is to simply transparently torify everything down the pipe, doing so does nothing for the anonymity set of the user behind the black box. We discussed alternate options, such as providing a captive portal that would instruct a user to download a copy of TBB and use the local router device as a first hop into the Tor network, perhaps by configuring the device as a bridge. Clearly not as easy as plug-n-play, but since most users of this type of device would continue to use their original highly fingerprintable browser, transparently torifying everything probably wont provide the anonymity that they claim. And although they do link to  they should probably take a read through  themselves.

On the other hand, any Tor-Related hardware is of interest the wider community, and many on these lists would be happy to receive/evaluate/give feedback, on both actual physical hardware as well as proposed designs.

@_subject: [tor-talk] "Remation" -- joint GCHQ/NSA meeting on Tor 
It's probably quite easy to distinguish bwauth measurements as the
measurement endpoints are hosted on the clearnet and even though bwauth
operators should be running their own measurement endpoint the file sizes
of bwauth fetches are a set size, nor does bwauth verify the content of the
files it fetches, nor the ssl certificates presented by the endpoints.
A few ideas:
1. enumerate a set of high bandwidth (CDN) download links that could be
used instead of hosting our own files. (bwauth could potentially choke the
download after a # of bytes have been fetched and use a popular large
2. That said,  I think it might be rude to use someone elses infrastructure
here. Is there a way that we can measure performance over directory fetches
without screwing up Tor user stats? Or, can tor provide a bandwidth
measurement endpoint internal to the relay?

best-effort 'trust' or pin the certs)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Fw: Your feedback to Startpage 
Per discussion with some randoms in  I emailed startpage to
clarify how their rate limiting is applied to Tor. Here's the response
I received below.
Begin forwarded message:
Dear Aaron,
At Ixquick and StartPage, we feel sympathetic to the Tor project. Tor
fulfills an important role in keeping the Internet private - especially
in the world after Snowden.
StartPage and Ixquick are anonymous search engine that have all sorts
of costs to cover; search results, servers, bandwidth.  We are showing
sponsored ads on the top of the page to balance those costs.
By nature, Tor traffic generates close to zero revenue - while the
claim on servers and bandwidth is large. Therefore we simply cannot
accommodate all Tor traffic unrestricted.
The answer to your question can be found in our support article:
The article text is quoted below:
How does StartPage prevent scraping and abuse without recording IP
In order to prevent our service from being "scraped" or excessively
queried by automatic programs or bots - with resulting server slow-down
and extra costs to our organization - our engineers have devised
intelligent methods to filter out those unwanted visitors.
We do not know the real IP address until somebody turns abusive.  This
is one of our strongest privacy features.
An abusive source is one that sends large amount of queries in a short
span of time. The IP addresses are saved in a one-way encrypted form in
in-memory hash under normal usage condition. We keep track of the
number of requests being made. In other words, instead of keeping track
that a user with IP 12.34.56.78 has performed some number of searches,
StartPage encrypts this using a one-way hash to a random string such as
"D87ab420475rn3ner65", for example, that can't be reversed to find the
IP address.
When the number of requests from a source crosses pre-defined
thresholds that we deem to be abusive, the source is added to a block
list. For all others, the in-memory hash is cleared, so no record
remains of even the one-way-encrypted hashes. We use a similar approach
for IP ranges.
The IPs of the Tor exit nodes can be retrieved from the Internet. Those
IPs can be rate limited without storing the IPs according the above
Again, thank you for contacting us. Your feedback helps us continue to
keep making StartPage even better. And since you appreciate what we do,
please tell your friends about StartPage so we can help keep the
Internet free and private.
Best regards,
Deborah H.
Your question to Startpage was:
    01-18-2014  -  Request for clarification of how startpage
implements autoquery rate limiting without logging users IP addresses
Several Tor community members are curious how startpage can claim
"Since January 2009 we do not record our users' IP addresses
anymore" ( yet has
implemented rate limiting from Tor exit nodes, presumably due to abuse.
Could you please clarify how this is implemented?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Protest Blocking Tor via CloudFlare 
Well, the catch here is that CloudFlare doesn't allow their free tier of users to disable the CAPTCHA completely, so there isn't a lot that site operators can do except complain to CloudFlare.
I've made a few suggestions to CloudFlare engineers, who are interested in improving CloudFlare experience for Tor users. You might recall the infinite-captcha-loop bug that existed for Tor users -- that seems to have been fixed. Thanks!
The suggestions I made were:
1. Web applications that can differentiate between GET and POST methods for reading vs submitting content should be able to configure at the request-method granularity whether or not a CAPTCHA is served. I offered that we could write a blog post to educate site operators how to use this option.
2. CloudFlare should ensure that they have presence within AS or datacenters where Tor Exits are present, and that their GeoDNS correctly points requests from Tor to the nearest cache endpoint. I don't know if anyone has measured this, but it should be straightforward to do so. This has a few upsides for both Tor users and CloudFlare. The first is that request latency for Tor users would be improved, and the second is that egress bandwidth costs could be reduced for both the Exit operator and CloudFlare (assuming that traffic within a datacenter or AS is counted separately).
A suggestion that I had not yet made was that CloudFlare could also turn off CAPTCHA for naked GET requests by default (requests without One problem that CloudFlare CAPTCHA has caused for the OONI ( project is that we use Tor as a control measurement for users who are trying to evaluate censorship in their country. Some of ooni-probe's tests (such as http_requests) make two requests, one via Tor and one without, so that the user can be given an indicator of whether censorship might be happening in their country. Unfortunately, CAPTCHA breaks that comparison. Now, we collect samples from a variety of locations, and CAPTCHA isn't served for every request - so a researcher can filter the CloudFlare CAPTCHA from the dataset fairly easily, but it increases our false positive rate and reduces the usefulness of the tool to end users who want to know what things are being censored in their country. We don't normally test URLs with parameters, and most sites probably won't suffer from spam if simple GET requests are permitted, but it would definitely improve the quality of the measurements we make.
