repeating in my log. Why are there signing keys made
up of zeroes? Is this a serious error, or just a

@_subject: is Java unsafe to use with Tor?  
Greetings, (I'm not sure if this is exactly the right place to
discuss this, but it pertains to using proxies in Java
in a possibly unsafe manner, and this sort of thing
seems to only matter to users of Tor)
If I hava a Java program, and I do something like the
following: Properties systemSettings = System.getProperties();
systemSettings.put("http.proxyHost", "127.0.0.1");
systemSettings.put("http.proxyPort", "8118");
This has the effect that all HTTP connections
following will be proxied via port 8118 on localhost,
where an instance of Privoxy might be listening. A
problem soon arises however if for some reason,
Privoxy isn't currently listening (for example, it
crashes, or it is hosted on another system that has
gone down, or whatever). In the case that nothing is
listening on the intended port, Java will switch to
making connections directly instead. This could be, of
course, somewhat disasterous from a security POV. Are there any Java folks who have any insight about
how the "feature" is disabled? The expected behavior
should be that if the configured proxy is down,
connections should fail (as they would in any other
system). Or is Java just an unsafe system to try to be
anonymous in? Do You Yahoo!?

@_subject: is Java unsafe to use with Tor? 
Well, I wasn't talking about running random Java
applets in a web browser (I don't even have the
browser plugin installed for Java, so no problems
there), or setting any system-wide proxy settings, or
anything like that. I'm already aware of those
problems. I'm talking about a Java program that I control and
can tell it to use a proxy, just like any other app
that supports proxy connections. The problem is simply
that the Java implementation (in this case, Sun Java
1.5, I have not tried this with other implementations)
will always default to direct connections whenever the
proxy is not available, which isn't a desirable
behavior at all. It would be as if you configured your browser or
e-mail client to use a proxy, and it going out of its
way to make direct connections anyway if your proxy
happened to be down. I think anyone here would call
that a problem (but people outside the Tor community
do not, hardly anyone even recognizes there might be a
problem with that sort of thing, it is just a great
feature that lets you pretend everything is working
when it isn't). There seems to be no way to override that broken
behavior. I'd rather not have to use yet another VM to
overcome it (I don't want to VNC all the traffic from
this system to the proxy, anyway). If Java won't work
sensibly, then it's probably a better idea to just use
something else. Do You Yahoo!?

Sorry to reply to myself. Of course, I meant to say

@_author: tor user 
@_subject: is Java unsafe to use with Tor? 
Yup. Well, it is just something that I am
experimenting on. I looked at that, too. At first, it looks like it
causes the same behavior as before. connectFailed()
only tells you something failed, it doesn't give you
anything to control on the connection itself (such as
to tell it to quit trying, or something else useful).
As soon as connectFailed() returns, the connection
immediately tries again on the next proxy, or direct
if there aren't any more to try, even if your select()
didn't include a direct connect item in the list it
returned (strange behavior again!) A really ugly hack I tried is to throw a
RuntimeException in connectFailed(). That seems to
shut things up pretty good, and the connection does
not automatically retry. I'd rather do something more
specific (a RuntimeException from trying to open a
connection? that's so *ugly*!), but the abstract
connectFailed() doesn't give anything more useful to
make things fail nicely. Yes. Thanks. Do You Yahoo!?

How can this be mitigated? Does it help to replace the field with a random number, or set it to zero, or would that just lead to more problems for anonymity?       ____________________________________________________________________________________

@_subject: Need help with MPAA threats 
seems to contradict:
Do you mean you want a way to *automatically*, without recording/logging/inspecting personally, deny certain traffic and allow other? (but isn't that censorship anyway?)
Don't we usually hate when ISPs do the same to their customers?
If you are in a condition where your traffic can get you into trouble with the ruling class, then please don't run an exit.
But trying to pick-and-choose the traffic you want to allow is not helping to frustrate censorship, in fact it is promoting it.

So if you have only port 80 open, your connection is being under-utilized.
Because it isn't efficient.

It's possibly due to the Qt related bug. The latest
bundle was compiled with Qt 4.3.3, which triggers a
bug in Vidalia. Use an older Vidalia, or compile the
latest Vidalia SVN which has the fix.       ____________________________________________________________________________________

That reminds me of a story I read a while ago about a
kid who had been arrested and held for 12 days for
making a bomb threat to his school via telephone. But
the administrators had made a mistake and didn't allow
for clock change (changing to DST) when they checked
the phone logs, so they had arrested an innocent
person. I wonder about similar things happening when reports
are made against IP addresses. Imagine an error is
made when converting between timezones, for example.
Or a much more likely mistake that some webserver's
time is out of sync with the ISP.
Imagine what someone was doing with your new IP
address the few hours before you had control of it, or
the few hours after you release it, when such errors
can happen.       ____________________________________________________________________________________

Oops, sent the email too soon. I wanted to add: I would feel really nervous about changing my IP so
many times per day. I'd rather keep an IP address for
a long time if possible to minimize risks of such
errors causing me trouble.       ____________________________________________________________________________________
