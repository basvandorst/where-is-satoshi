@_subject: [tor-talk] Concerns on autostart.sh of TBB 
Hash: SHA1
Hi my dear list.
Lazy as I am I'm now starting the TBB on mount of my TrueCrypt Volume
by this autostart.sh:
exec tor-browser_de/start-tor-browser
Are there any concerns regarding this approach or is this maybe the
standard to do it good for the lazy man? I'm at the moment fine with this.
I did the TBB inside the TC Vol to be secure off getting my bookmarks
saved in a save place.
Greetings, sebiti

Hi all.
I have a problem with my TBB installation. While in default Ubuntu
13.10 Firefox install and all other ubuntu programs I can input with
the keyboard it's not working in TBB FF. In Vidalia it's also no
problem. Just within FF nothing. Not in settings neither in a web-page
input-field nor the address bar. Copy'n'paste is the only thing that
works... I'm clueless.
Someone has an idea what to do?
