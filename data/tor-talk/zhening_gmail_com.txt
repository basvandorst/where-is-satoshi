@_subject: [tor-talk] How to find out the session key 
I have read the design paper for TOR and build my onion router
successful. I know where the onion key, RSA public key, certificate stored,
but I can?t find the session key (created by Diffie-Hellman algorithm,
which is used to generate a cipher stream).
        I think the session key is stored somewhere in memory (or just in
file?), could anyone please give me a hint how to find out the key.
        Thanks for your kindness.

Thanks all of you for giving me these important messages, i am reading them
and hope can figure out the way to get the key.
It is pretty good to have a discussion with experts, rather than just to
waste time on insignificant issues.
Thanks again!
