@_subject: [tor-talk] Test failed for Tor 0.2.6.7 on Ubuntu trusty armhf 
Hello everybody,
When trying to build Tor 0.2.6.7 for Ubuntu Trusty (under armhf), I got a test failure, which prevents building.
Extract from the buildlog that you can download there: address/get_if_addrs_ifaddrs: [forking] test: ../src/common/log.c:465: logv__real: Assertion `severity >= 3 && severity <= 7' failed.
qemu: uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped
[Lost connection!]
  [get_if_addrs_ifaddrs FAILED]
Is that a bug or a problem?
Thanks for your help. Have a nice day.
