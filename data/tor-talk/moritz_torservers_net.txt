@_subject: Visualization: Tor nodes on Google Maps and Google Earth 
I wrote a small ugly Python script to visualize Tor relays on Google
Maps and Google Earth. You can see the result here:
* Open KML file in Google Maps:
* Download tormap.kml for Google Earth
The KML standard is being pushed by Google and should work for
OpenStreetMap, too, but I couldn't get it to load there. Feel free to
modify the script to generate other outputs.
The initial idea was to scale the marker size to show the relay's
bandwidth, but Google Maps does not support this.
The markers might give a false impression of accuracy. Most IPs can only
be tracked to city level (or even region), ie. the markers are somewhat
near, not necessarily at the real location of the relay.
You can download the script here:
 (LGPL)
This is a one-time snapshot and I will not update it regularly, unless
there is public interest to do so. The bandwidth categories are based on
the reported "observed bandwidth" at the time of creation, so the actual
number of high bandwidth nodes will fluctuate every time the script is
run. It would be nice to extend this script to use longer-term bandwidth
calculation like TorStatus does, and to generate a map over time using
all the consensus data provided at  An
example of what this could look like is Vis4Net's Wikileaks Mirror World
Map at  .

If the user IP is not used/exposed, how could it serve as a Tor bridge or middle node better than if you install Tor on all your front-end proxies?
Why would you want to run multiple bridges on one shared IP?

----- quote -----
Hello bitcoiners,
I'm investigating if here is a demand for anonymous VPS (virtual
private servers) service. I have multicore beast server lying around,
many years experiences with linux administration and also experiences
with Tor hidden services.
I was thinking about anonymous VPS many years before. There were
attemps to do on Tor network, but payments were always problem. There
were some free hostings, but quality was always poor. I found bitcoins
recently and now feel I have all pieces to do VPS hosting powerful and
thanks to bitcoins - really anonymous.
My idea is simple - provide "no question" service. I don't know my
customers is and customers don't know who I am. This is huge advantage
in contrast to Vekja because nobody know where the server is located
 and
how to shut down it. I provide 1 or more CPU cores, few hundreds MB RAM
and few onion addresses routed to VPS ports. Customer
will send me few bitcoins every week. Simple.
Only one pitfail is here. Because of strong anonymity, all inbound and
outbound traffic is routed to Tor network. No direct connection to
Internet. Never. It makes system management slower, but anonymity is
the main concern.
Users can access server using Tor network or directly from Internet
using great service  (hidden services are indexed by
  Google).
Price. My offer is 1 core @ 3GHz and 512MB RAM, SLA 99% (minus glitches
Tor network) for 30 bitcoins per week. But I'm open to discussion here
for first users. I need at least 3 users to pay housing. Please comment
here or send me anonymous message to I swear to send 20% of bitcoins to providers of torservers.net and
tor2web.com. First one because they are Tor relay providers accepting
bitcoins and second one cause their service is needed for my
anonymous VPS. They do not accept bitcoins yet, but I expect it is
temporary Smiley.

@_subject: IRQ balancing 
In case you're wondering what this is about: If you see high CPU usage
on one core on your high bandwidth server (>200 Mbit/s, lots of
connections), it is very likely that only one of your CPU is handling
network interrupts.
Let me add a few things I've learned from fighting with this problem:
irqbalance doesn't help a thing, all it does is rotate smp_affinity, so
our 100% usage moved from one core to another. I also tried different
kernels and various e1000e drivers in hope to get MSI-X working, but it
seems as if our hardware doesn't support it (
 ).
In the end the only thing that helped was to enable Receive Packet
Steering (RPS), which is in the kernel since 2.6.35, but poorly
documented. I still plan to move all the Tor related posts to a separate
blog on torservers, but for now you can find how to enable RPS here:

Yes. You can choose to download the "portable" Tor Browser Bundle. Or
you can even install the Vidalia bundle, and all it will do is add the
Torbutton extension to your Firefox. The rest will stay untouched, and
you can remove it any time.
Each application you want to use with Tor needs to be configured to use
it. Many applications can use Tor as a SOCKS proxy properly, but many
others can not. If you want to use Tor just for websites, all you have
to do is install the Vidalia bundle (and enable Torbutton in Firefox).
It is probably good to set up a separate Firefox profile for Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] To Toggle, or not to Toggle: The End of Torbutton 
Thank you. This list is dominated, if not completely focused, on
development and security research. The Torproject as a whole has for the
last 10 years failed to split off a separate section for users (website,
FAQ, mailing list, whatever). I don't think there is a proper way to do
it and not duplicate stuff, however. There are a few other reasons that
stopped Torproject from doing that, the most prominent I think always
was that "devs should not lose contact with actual users".
I don't consider myself a security researcher, but I've been following
the Tor project since its early days. The misconception and
misunderstandings grew over time as the user base expanded, and while
Torbutton is a great and excellent project, in a way it only further
complicated things.
The problem is rooted in the vocabulary. I am not sure if it's the best
thing to cite, and I am in no way educated enough to say it is the
definitive guide, but as far as I know the "Anon Terminology" paper
published by Andreas Pfitzmann since 2000 tried to form a definitive
base for discussion. He collected, if not influenced, different terms
around anonymity.
It's been a while since I've last read it, but if I remember correctly
it fails to separate anonymity into different "types".
Anonymity is a hard term, and simply cannot be achieved when using
electronic communication. Tor, without Torbutton, tries its best to
anonymize *traffic*, ie. make it hard to know who is talking to whom.
Tor does not, and never did, try to fix the problem of identifying
information *inside* the transported data. Tor is completely neutral in
that respect.
The problem is that a lot of applications transmit user identifyable
information. It is not Tor's job to stop that, mostly because there is
no way to know what kind of information is "identifying" in a certain
situation, and if the user wants to transmit that kind of information in
the first place.
Torbutton, despite its name, has nothing to do with Tor. It works great
for any other proxy software, too. Torbutton does what Tor does not:
Block application-specific information that could leak your identity
without you explicitly telling it to do so. For that, it has to know the
protocol and the application. Any other application or protocol could as
well be "screened and cleaned" by something like Torbutton. For example,
one could write a "BittorrentButton" for a torrent client.
In general, I find it hard to explain the difference, because the
community lacks different names for the different properties that, as a
whole, define "anonymity". At least I don't know how to separate these,
but maybe I'm just not educated enough.

Hi Fabio,
Before you (or someone else) start to even think about hijacking

apply or help us apply for grants. There is a large number of grants a
Tor exit node operator, especially if it's an officially registered
non-profit organization like ours, could apply for. We just don't do so
at the moment for lack of time.
Also, a model we at the moment don't announce widely: Offer
organizations and individuals to run a node for them with a name and
(R)DNS entry of their chosing. I could guess several NGOs would like to
see their names on a large node, but don't want to get involved in the
legal stuff.
Another way to go with Tor, as with most other open source projects:
Offer professional help and consulting; for example (try to) sell
private bridges or Torouters.

Thank you for your question. Now I finally forced myself to update the wiki entry at Here's the new section on RIPE:
With RIPE, it works even better than with ARIN as most people respect the WHOIS entry there without going directly for the upstream record. In our experience, this happens a lot with ARIN. But - my guess is due to some stricter regulations by RIPE - less ISPs are willing to reassign RIPE IPs.
Some reports, like Shadowserver reports, get sent to the AS, so WHOIS does not help against those. With luck you can get your ISP to ignore or auto-forward them to you.
If you don't have "mtner" and "person" handles for your Tor exits, use the wizard at  or manually create them at You need at least one mtner and one "person" handle. Tell your ISP to create an "inetnum" record linking those handles. You should suggest apprioriate "desc", "remarks" and "country" entries. RIPE does not require this country to be the location of your server, nor your location. Your ISP might want either your location or the servers location in there. If you want to confuse GeoIP, you can specify another country. It is also possible to list more than one country, but be aware that it takes several months for GeoIP services to pick up changes (if they ever do) and that you won't be able to edit the "inetnum" record Maintainer record example:

Hi all, Hi Joseph,
It's a very tough decision to make. Our current funds ($2400) mean we
would survive 3 months. Three months of beating the drum, incorporation,
proper announcement and press release, finally translating the website,
plus some nice ticking clocks and bars on the website and Kickstarter
State of affairs:
100tb doesn't respond
2host doesn't respond
evoboxes isn't quite sure yet; cannot SWIP yet
Most don't like us
Other are too expensive: Professional offers start at ~500 Euro per 200
Mbps at the cheapest (with 100 of that already donated)
FDC has a new datacenter in CZ, $300 for "unmetered Gbit"; not sure they
would accept us, waiting on a reply. Mike Perry left and told me to
better stay away, but he was at a US datacenter.
And we don't even know if we can push the server to Gbit anyway. There
seem to be some bottlenecks still hidden inside the code. Amunet is at
not more than 800 Mbps most of the time.
We can:
* go with Swiftway in a strategic moment and hope for the best (in terms
of bandwidth and publicity)
* run the first Icelandic exit for 12?/Mbps
* go with a reliable 200 mbps in Germany for ~500 Euro/mnth
* try FDC
* look/wait for better offers
I think we should make a decision before, or, at the latest, at the
foundation meeting. I haven't heard back from the tax authorities yet, I
expect it to take no longer than one more week. I'm leaving Dresden for
two weeks on 22nd, so Feb 19th would be the last possible ad hoc
founding date or we'll have to postpone until mid March.

Hi Dirk,
What do you want to know exactly? In many countries, running an
anonymizing service is definitely not illegal. Many exit operators run
into trouble with their ISP, because they are too easily scared by DMCA
complaints and the like. This is especially true for an exit policy that
allows arbitrary ports, as your ISP will be flooded with mails from
BayTSP/MediaSentry. That's why we have compiled a list of well-known
ports. [1]
You should find an ISP who explicitly allows you to run a Tor exit, and
if you want you can start with an open exit policy. If your ISP
complaints and wants to shut you down later, you can switch to the
reduced exit policy. Or, you can allow exiting only to a few ports. It's
your decision.
Try to convince your ISP to SWIP the IP range and attach your personal
abuse handle. Example:
Most complaints you will have to deal with can be easily solved by
telling them about Tor. In extreme cases, the police might come knocking
to your door or even try to seize your equipment, but I am only aware of
a single case in Germany where that happened some years ago.
If you need technical help setting up a node, the comments in torrc and
the documentation on the website should help you. If not, join  on
irc.oftc.net and I'm sure there will be someone to give you a hand.

That is already included in the first paragraph: "[...] to the extent
necessary to enable the use". It is not defined that a particular
service may not require some personal identifiable data over the course
of the whole period, but it is only allowed to do so if it is really
_required_ for either usage or billing of the service.
Most services just don't care enough, and apart from areas where you can
make a shitload of money by harrassing people it is rarely prosecuted.
For example, using Google Analytics was and has always been illegal in
Germany, but you still can find hundreds of German sites using it.
To make this clear: If you as an operator are based in Germany, you have
to follow the German law, even if your server is located in other countries.

I am still running a limited exit node (accept 22,53,443) on United
Hoster's "VPS Home". To be honest, I haven't told them about it, but
their TOS does not explicitly disallow it. On that node I have only
received a complaint once, and they forwarded it to me to deal with it.
I am not sure what will happen once you run a larger node there, and
advise you to talk to them first.
They offer "unlimited traffic" on even their cheapest plans, but I
didn't want to overplay it, so my Tor node there is limited to
500kb/800kb burst.
You might want to look at the Tor node list first, and NOT chose one of
the providers already in the list. Decentralization is good, and we need
more diversity.

* SOFTLAYER/100TB:
A few days ago Softlayer nullrouted ONE of our exit IPs, but the other
IPs are still up. So much for the 72hr deadline issued on Dec 5th
(because of one DMCA complaint).
I could just move the one "dead" exit to one of our unused IPs, but we
have used up most of our bandwidth in the current billing period anyway
(85TB at the moment, one week to go), so it doesn't hurt that much and
I'll let it run with three Tor processes for the next week.
BW: Every time I ask 100tb about the new server in the UK, they tell me they
will get "back to me with an offer shortly".

non-profit organization. I have found an excellent privacy lawyer who
helps me to set everything up, and the foundation will be based in their

Contact your ISP and tell them what you want to do. Ask if it's possible to SWIP your IP range and attach your own abuse handle (email address).

At least in Germany, you can buy SIMs not activated in a lot of shops
without showing ID. It is an open secret that you can activate many of
them using a(ny) correct address without further verification.
Also off topic: For example, UKash vouchers are being sold across Europe
and can be used to buy prepaid Mastercards online using a service called
UKash Neo, using SMS as owner verification. I can confirm that the CCs
work even with Paypal.
In the US, a lot of shops sell prepaid CCs ("gift cards"). To use
online, they also require some sort of address verification, which is
probably hard to do in a country where there is no ID or residency register.

I know I can set up custom Tor networks, but it's not really something
that is well explained. I envision it in a way where I can chose what
network I want to become part of - eg. by downloading all/its config
files from some place (client/middle/exit selectable) - and it sets up
the rest.
Also, but this is a whole different disussion and I'll ask it on the Tor

Onions Against Dictators - Torservers.net supports democracy movements
by providing uncensorable gateway to free Internet; receives $10,000
grant from Access Now
Uncensored access to the Internet can overthrow dictators and aid the
creation of free societies. This has been shown by recent events in
North Africa and the Middle East. Whether in Tunisia, Egypt or Libya -
the revolution is inseparably linked to free communication and
unhindered access to independent news and media.
Till today the Torservers.net project has been graciously financed by
private donations from supporters. Now, founder Moritz Bartl and his
team have partnered with Access Now. Torservers.net has received a
$10,000 US Dollars grant from Access Now that allows for a major
capacity upgrade as an immediate tech response to support freedom
movements all around the globe. This makes Torservers.net the largest
operator on the Tor network.
Tor ? The Gateway to Freedom
With the free software Tor, Internet traffic is securely passed through
relay stations to prevent censorship and surveillance
( The bandwidth and computers used are mostly
provided by volunteers, many using their home PCs. Every day more than
200,000 people use Tor, including human rights activists, government
officials, police investigators, journalists, non-profits and private
individuals. Torservers.net helps the network grow, by making additional
resources available to those in need of protecting their personal
freedom and privacy online. These resources greatly improve the overall
speed and availability of the Tor network.
Foundation of Zwiebelfreunde e.V. ("Friends of the Onion")
Zwiebelfreunde is a non-profit association that manages the successful
Torservers.net platform. In addition, the organisation acts as a user
group mediator for security and tech professionals. It organises various
meetings and workshops within Germany and around  Europe together with
international partners such as German Whistleblower-Netzwerk e.V., Open

the Belgian Pirate Party and others to "ensure that Internet censorship

I wrote a small shell script that generates torrents for all files in

Torrents are good for censorship circumvention if Torproject.org and
mirrors are blocked, because they automatically look for peers using a
DHT: Any seeder is a potentially unblocked source for Tor.
Also, torrents allow for magnet link distribution. For example, the
magnet link for tor-browser-1.3.20_en-US.exe is
Contains my script (createtorrents.sh) and rrandom's approach
(generate-mktorrent-commands.lua). His is improved as it groups files
for torrents, but it does not work because mktorrent does not support
torrent creation for more than one file or directory.
We add several HTTP mirrors as sources inside the Torrents, that's why
they already work great without any "native Torrent seeders".
Please talk to me or rrandom on IRC if you want to help improve it. It
will likely be used officially for Torproject.

This is the hidden redundancy feature built in to Tor. The last of the
systems to publish its key is the one that receives the traffic, so
there is no load balancing, but if one of the systems go down, the other
will "automatically take over" after a period of max ~30 mins IIRC.
Hijacking is very unlikely as you would have to generate the same public
key. As the owner of a hidden service you can copy the keyfiles to as
many machines as you wish to achieve some level of redundancy.

I agree with Fabio on this one. A website explaining the badge should

CCC and Torservers could host one.
As for badge design, a script should support multiple designs (could be
as easy as to drop images into a directory, and use a GET/POST parameter
to select the images). Personally, I would like to see something as
simple as the Torbutton "broken onion" (no text), one at 88x33 and one
at 80x15.
Another paragraph should mention that it only compares your IP to a list
of exit IPs, so it can lead to false positives if you happen to use the

@_subject: [tor-talk] Ideas to securely implement PGP encryption/decryption 
The problem Robert and katmagic are referring to (read access to the
DOM) can only be mitigated by disabling active scripting on the pages
where GPG is used. The plugin probably would have to notify the user,
then disable all scripting and reload the page, before executing GPG
functionality. This does not help against the "read plaintext before
encryption" attack, obviously.
At the moment, I cannot think of any attack vectors once you combine it
with enabled Torbutton (or a stripped down Tor Browser) where active
scripting/access to the DOM is disabled completely.

It is best if people chose different ISPs and not group at a handful of

Torservers.net had best experiences by trying a two-step approach: We
first ask if they were ok with Tor and reassignment of IPs, no detailed
explanation for both. Once they get back positively we explain Tor and
how it can become problematic. We reassure the ISP that we will answer
abuse complaints within a short time span (usually, 24 hours is
expected; we try to keep it within an hour). We keep some templates at

I don't believe in "privacy hosters". Once police is involved, every ISP

like Hetzner will. I don't really see what exactly you are trying to

you can only protect by providing the ISP with fake data and paying

Estimated bandwidth for this router, in bytes per second.  The
"average" bandwidth is the volume per second that the OR is willing to
sustain over long periods; the "burst" bandwidth is the volume that
the OR is willing to sustain in very short intervals.  The "observed"
value is an estimate of the capacity this relay can handle.  The
relay remembers the max bandwidth sustained output over any ten
second period in the past day, and another sustained input.  The
"observed" value is the lesser of these two numbers.

I don't see why all Torbutton installations should constantly waste CPU

And that just won't happen.
I believe it's more important to make it easy for people to detect Tor
and deal with it differently in the first place. The second step then is
to provide useful alternatives to blocking.
Currently, what happens is that sites just ban/blacklist the IPs, often
automatically and "forever". When people report abuse to us, I have a
hard time helping them. All I can do is point them to the DNSBL and the
Bulk List Exporter, and ask kindly to not block these IPs for too long,
but most likely they will load it into their iptables and that's that.
My vision would be a Wordpress plugin that lets me choose to deal with
Tor users differently, say, automatically require moderation on comments.
Scroogle is currently having trouble scraping Google. Maybe Dash Fours

From what I understand, this is a problem not of running the bridge on a

ways to distribute bridges you could imagine than are available now.
Also, it highly depends on the country you are distributing IPs to.
Like, there might be countries that don't block Tor bridges at all (for
now and a long time), others might detect them quickly, so changing IPs
are important.
In general I would say: bridges on changing IPs are great, although they
might not too help much at the moment - especially obfs2 bridges.

The problem is that Bittorrent opens a lot of concurrent connections to

and get mighty mighty speed" add to that.
The second reason to avoid Bittorrent over Tor is that there is no
audited torrent client. There is none because of the first reason. There
have been studies about various torrent clients leaking information
directly leading to the deanonymization of users (IIRC the packets
contained local interface IPs), and Tor cannot stop an application from
doing that.
But, yes, in general it holds that the Tor network could use more relays.
Everyone has a "customized" operating system. Windows users not so much
because Microsoft's greatest failure was to never add package
management. Still, knowing about the updates itself is already a risk
for your anonymity. Ideally, all Tor users would use the exact same
version of some static operating system like TAILS, and update all at once.

Most likely, you are confused by the initial page that Tor Browser

Tor by looking up the IP address you are using to a list of exit IP

announcing themselves to the Tor network for incoming connections than
the IP address the exit uses for outgoing connections. Thus, quite

It is indeed a tough problem, but I guess we have to try and see how it

It is already the case that (large) parts of the Tor network are funded

Another open question is what we should do with headers. At the moment,
the configuration file (onion_anonymize_headers) explicitly removes
User-Agent, X-Enigmail, X-Mailer and X-Originating-IP, whitelists
((Resent-)?From|To|Cc|Date|Return-Path|Message-ID|Reply-To|Bcc), and
then throws away any other header. This is obviously not the final
configuration. If anyone wants to contribute, feel welcome.
I hope that with the modified torsocks that has an option to only torify
.onion I can simply put it in front of postfix and be done. We'll see.
I invite everyone to contribute to the postfix configuration, and,
eventually, to run more mail gateways.

I want to have a script that scans all incoming mail for the used cipher

the sender and postmaster at senderdomain to get their stuff fixed and to
get the sender to move to a proper provider. I want this not only for
this gateway, but for all mail servers I operate. The script should
support pure notification, but also "bouncing" the mail with this custom
reply for non-TLS (before-queue Milter).
Someone has to start working more aggressively for proper TLS sessions.
If people behind the gateway can't get email from Yahoo users, so be it.
See also last paragraph of this mail.
The gateway becomes more interesting for attackers if it sees plaintext
mail. If we are coerced into or the box modified to accept also
plaintext mail even though we only accepted PGP mail, you know there's
something fishy about it.
If other entities want to run differently configured mail gateways, I'm

In over 10 years of development and thinking going into Tor, do you
think you're the first to come up with this idea? Nobody is stopping
anyone from coming with a proper design, but it's not as easy as you
seem to believe.
Every client has to download the full list of relays ("consensus")
periodically. In areas with little connectivity, this already puts a
high burden on clients.
It is very hard for Tor clients to determine which relays to use. If you
have many low bandwidth relays, you need a good way to determine if a
relay is currently "available", or already in use.
A related ticket is "Mike's performance work has shown that the smaller relays -- for
example, the ones that set bandwidthrate and bandwidthburst to 20k --
are never good news to have in your circuit. Damon McCoy's hotpets 2010
paper showed more details of how you could improve performance by
dumping the bottom X% of the relays."
A good document to read is the Tor Path Specification:
I'm not saying that it's impossible to make use of low bandwidth relays,
but it would need a careful design and new path selection mechanism.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Email provider for privacy-minded folk 
It is unlikely that any mail provider wipes/shreds mails on deletion and
while they go through the various processing stages. [1] Even if they
use an encrypted file system (another doubt there, why should they;
probably not even encrypted swap), as long as the system is up and
running the mail could be recovered from various places.
A big problem also is backups: Most of us do want backups. It is quite
hard to design a backup system that allows you to remove files
selectively later. If that is even what you want, since it is a backup
and you might have deleted the file by mistake. I don't know of any mail
provider that offers to selectively exclude accounts/aliases from backup.
Same for IP logs. Are they stored on a tmpfs, shredded on deletion? How
long are they kept? Even Autistici and Riseup will keep some IP/user
logs to kill spamming accounts? I doubt 24hours is enough...
Another neat feature would be accounts where the Maildir completely live
on a tmpfs -- including spool etc.
If there was any money in this, at least to cover costs, I would have
started a mail provider myself long time ago. Another showstopper is
that in Germany, every mail provider is required to install a law
enforcement blackbox and retain shitloads of logs if they have more than
9999 customers.

Even if they encrypt maildirs on their servers and unlock only while you
are logged in, they can sniff your login/encryption password and poof.
That's what Hushmail was forced to do on request by law enforcement.
The only way to do this properly is to encrypt all incoming mails using
your public key. That way, existing mails are protected. New incoming
mails can still be intercepted when they are coming in, of course,
that's why the provider should offer an option to drop non-PGP mail
directly at MTA level for selective aliases/accounts. [1] Webmail will
become mostly useless for these accounts. To be able to do fulltext
search etc. one could add a local (!) imapproxy that decrypts all mails
before putting them into the mail application's inbox. Is there anything
like that?
Similar thoughts for outgoing mails.
Every provider supports this, just use PGP for everything. No provider
can "offer" it, that is impossible.

Most likely. Why not?
"My" way would be to produce the browser addon independently from
offering mail services. The mail provider would then just be
recommending the "third-party" addon -- even if the addon is made
specifically for that service (or web interface).
Browser plugins for en/decryption were often discussed here and you
should be aware of their issues. In short, you cannot create a safe
en/decryption plugin and at the same time have high usability.

It was decided that we have no resources to maintain our own Q&A, and
that having a third-party Q&A is better than none. I disagree, but

I don't think Tor should endorse any proprietary, commercial platforms.
Especially when they force us into a specific mode of operation.
I would love to do user support more again, but I don't want to
participate in this. In my eyes, commercial services like SE are not
"better than nothing", they simply don't exist for me. I understand that
this is a somewhat radical view, but I've come a long way and this Q&A
discussion will not make me change.
I don't think Tor should endorse a service that pushes you towards
logging in with Facebook or Google accounts. I don't think Tor should
endorse services that don't manage to get SSL working properly across
their sites.
I don't think Tor should endorse a platform that pushes people towards
unified accounts across multiple sites. I understand that it is
beneficial to share reputation (which is btw one of the most important
areas of research), SE should at least make it possible to use different
nicknames across its sites.
I don't think Tor should endorse a platform that logs IPs. Logging
should always be minimal.
I don't think Tor should endorse a platform that we don't have an
automated backup of should it go away or we decide to move somewhere
else. There seems to be some limited manual export option, I have to
admit I did not look into it to closely. We also cannot migrate
I've contacted the author of Askbot some months ago to ask if he was
available for paid labor on Askbot. He is. We did not even try to
contact him again to ask if he was willing to volunteer for Tor, now
that it looks like there's no financial budget. We did not ask the
community if someone was willing to properly package Askbot and its
libraries. We did not reach out to ask if someone was willing to
maintain it for us. We did not collect issues that would need to be
fixed before we can use it.

> old Version:
This is not an "old version". It was never official, and the author has
no interest in talking to the Tor developer team, or writing a detailed
spec such as  that
exists for the official Tor Browser.
All in all, it is up to the (hopefully educated) user to choose between
the one that is built by a group of people with known background and
experience, or something released by a single person under pseudonym,
violating the Tor trademark and confusing users like you.
There is no safe way to combine a non-Tor browser with a Tor browser
just yet. For quite some time now, Tor Browser decided to thus get rid
of the option to Start or Stop. Especially now that Tor is "integrated
in the Tor Browser", and starts when you start the browser and stops
when you stop the browser, why should there be separate buttons?!
The user expects an application to start when they run it, and stop when
they close it, no?
Firefox is open source. Chrome is a potential choice, but there's a
number of issues that would need to be fixed in the Chrome source before
it can be used for a safe browser. There's not enough developers to
support multiple browsers, or dedicate time to implement missing
features in Chrome.
Usability studies show, quite expectedly, that many users are confused
by separate applications. Most users just don't need all the extra
features that are present in Vidalia. On MacOS, for example, the GUI
adds *both* Vidalia and the browser component to a launch area: many
users then start just the browser, which fails because Tor is not running.
Look for the real conspiracies and economical dependencies, rather than
implying that Google, one of the *victims* of PRISM et al, sponsors a
piece of software (just) to force it to add some sort of backdoor.

Hi Andrew,
Frankly, I don't see why you would want to run multiple relays on one
physical machine, unless you run into scaling problems (as Tor is not
yet good with multiple cores).
Anyway, you can use different VMs, but it is not a must. Personally, I
would run multiple instances of Tor in one VM. You can set up one Tor
for all your relays, and make it listen on all your interfaces (by
adding separate ORPort statements). You can do the same for your bridges
(separate ORPorts per bridge), but if you plan to add pluggable
transports like obfs2/obfs3, that will require one Tor process per bridge.
For a modified initscript that helps you manage multiple Tor processes
and configurations easily, see
Will you be hosting exit relays? Pretty please?
Relays will obviously also get blocked in countries like China. So far,

@_subject: [tor-talk] torslap! 
My thoughts exactly. But, in this case, I have to say from experience
that a few websites that use blacklists that block Tor preemptively,
mostly without knowing about it. These types of blocks can be overcome
often by just a friendly email that explains Tor.
The second and most common type of blocking happens after someone has
been "attacked" once, or twice, via Tor, or an active "attack" is
ongoing. I use quotation marks here because most things that happen
would not be considered real attacks. Many IDS, and nowadays even blog
software etc, detects "unlikely behaviour" such as port scanning,
crawling, trying some script kiddie SQL injections, looking for common
exploitable CMS and the like. Most of these "behaviours" are *not*
targetted at specific sites, many are just using some bad or worse
scanning tool.
This second type of blocking would be very much helped with something
like torslap.
Sites "under ongoing attack" could easily deploy them, maybe even
together with a timeout, and thus get rid of the one attacker without
having to block all Tor users (even temporarily, a mechanism which they
rarely lift again because they have no incentive to do so).
Sites that sometimes get hit by random scans and the like, not currently
under active attack, could also obviously benefit from torslap. I
haven't read the whole thread, but (Re)CAPTCHA could be considered a
cheap and powerful "proof of work", too.
I would love to see something as simple as an iptables bucket for Tor
users where they can be first sent to a different webserver/site, and
after they "do something there" the exit IP is temporarily removed from
the bucket. A second interesting approach would be something more
specific for the software used, like a Wordpress plugin that blocks
admin logins via Tor, puts Tor users under more "supervision" (moderated
postings/registration, only "guest Tor post" without the ability to log
in at all, read-only access, etc) etc.

"WebGL can reveal information about the video card in use, and high
precision timing information can be used to fingerprint the CPU and
interpreter speed."
The adversary simply renders WebGL, font, and named color data to a
Canvas element, extracts the image buffer, and computes a hash of that
image data. Subtle differences in the video card, font packs, and even
font and graphics library versions allow the adversary to produce a
stable, simple, high-entropy fingerprint of a computer. In fact, the
hash of the rendered image can be used almost identically to a tracking
cookie by the web server.
WebGL is fingerprintable both through information that is exposed about
the underlying driver and optimizations, as well as through performance
Because of the large amount of potential fingerprinting vectors and the
previously unexposed vulnerability surface, we deploy a similar strategy
against WebGL as for plugins. "

Unusual? Problems like this are very usual with any kind of filtering,

communicates with local Tor using SOCKS, and Tor wraps the HTTP(S)
request in its own protocol. Sounds like KIS messes with SOCKS in
strange ways.

I know there is a dedicated mailinglist for TAILS, but I figured I would
reach a larger audience here, and it might be of interest to many who
are not subscribed to the TAILS list.
Ideally, you use TAILS from a read-only medium. CD is best, but many
devices these days don't have an optical drive, and handling CDs is not
as convenient as a USB stick.
For quite some time, people kept recommending the TrekStor CS USB stick
[  ], one of the
few sticks available in Germany with write-protection switch. Turns out
they use a new firmware, and now don't support booting from it in
read-only mode. The company confirmed this via email.
There are roughly no alternatives, and I figured I'm not the only one
looking for USB sticks with write protection switch. Via alibaba.com, a
"wholesale Chinese ebay", I contacted various Chinese suppliers, and
ended up ordering two samples. Even there, the selection of sticks with
write protection is very limited.
I ended up paying paying 60? for the 2 samples because of shipping and
Western Union fees.
The sticks are not very fast, but acceptable, and boot in read-only
mode. They are not as slim as I hoped for, but the supplier is friendly,
production and shipping was very fast. (less than 2 weeks altogether).
Logo printing is cheap ($0.15 per stick), so to try the quality I also
had them print a logo on the samples.
I am still undecided whether I want the final sticks to have a logo, or
simply be blank to not attract too much attention. If you have a nice
idea for a logo, let me know. I want to order 100 sticks in time for
Chaos Communication Congress 30C3. The production cost is $4 per stick
(8GB), the final price (taxes, GEMA, shipping) will likely be around $15.

A hidden service adds extra hops to hide the (location of the) service.
There's some movement towards allowing services within the Tor network
to be just that, not hidden, removing the additional hops. I don't use
hidden services much, but they definitely are less reliable than
"regular" Tor use, and using hidden services adds extra/unnecessary load
to the network.
If I remember correctly the certificate for check.torproject.org is
pinned in TBB, so using a hidden service instead does not add any
security benefits.

patches that make this this a valid assumption.
This is the case for stock Firefox -- and I still don't understand why
it is not an enough high priority. I don't know for sure, but I just
assume Mike has added a patch that pins at least the check.tpo cert. I

I was wondering if anyone has interest in helping us with a small

In a short brainstorming session, we came up with a list of categories
that we want to split up the volunteer opportunities to, as well as
"ownership" positions so potential volunteers can more easily reach out
to someone human.
So, one part of my question is: Are we missing "obvious" categories for
volunteering? What do you think of the plan?
The second part of my question is: Looking at eg. Mozilla [1], or the
Tails project [2], I think we really should have nice icons/graphics
representing the different sections. A simple link list isn't going to
cut it. So, if anyone of you enjoys looking through clipart, it would
be awesome to get a nice set of these, with an acceptable license,
ideally Public Domain.

 * Software Development
   -> move most of current content there
 * Strengthen the Network
   -> run Relays
   -> donate to Torservers orgs
 * Help with Outreach
   -> flyers, infomaterial, logo, posters
   -> get marketing material for booths etc
 * Designers

Tracking is not so much an issue in Tor Browser, as by design, you can
request a new session ("New Identity"), and also you're not tracked
between browser sessions.
If you're worried about being tracked within one session, well, then
Javascript is only one of the many things you would have to worry about.
In scope of Tor Browser is fingerprinting /across/ sessions. Which is
why Tor Browser disables or fakes certain values (like installed fonts
etc), to make fingerprinting and thus tracking /across/ sessions harder.
Anti-fingerprinting patches are the main reason why you should not use a
regular Firefox, but always Tor Browser.
Tor Browser's design goal is that it should not leak any more
fingerprintable information with Javascript enabled than with Javascript
Tor Browser already sacrifices much 'convenience' (usability). Many
users want Flash, Java, and other plugins. It is really only a matter of
defaults, since it takes only a few clicks to disable Javascript if you
really don't want it. I agree, people with enough knowledge to
understand what breaks when you disable Javascript (and that is A LOT
these days), especially subtle things like a button not working etc.,
should disable Javascript. For regular users, it is just not obvious
when something on a website doesn't work -- it doesn't clearly tell you
that something is missing/disabled (compared to Flash, for example).
Personally, I have Javascript disabled in TBB. (and in my non-Tor
browser if I need it) I don't mind quickly changing the default with
every TBB update.

I wanted to publicly thank all the people who helped with the
organization of the Pre-PETS 2014 meetup.
Jaap van Ginkel and Joeroen van der Ham, thank you for providing your
department space and all the free coffee! Thanks Pepijn for your
shopping help, and thanks to the Renewable Freedom Foundation for snacks
and drinks. Thank you Merlijn and Jurre for being my local contacts and
connectors. Without all of you, this would not have been possible!
The idea of the event was simple: to provide a place where people can
meet each other, without having to coordinate on their own. We had three
rooms, two with projectors and whiteboards, so people had the option of
forming smaller groups and spread out. In the end, most of the ~30
participants stayed in the computer lab. We had a couple of
announcements for 'working groups'. A larger group talked about Tor's
legal and geographical diversity, but most people formed small groups of
2-4 and had open discussions. We could have accommodated way more
people, and then some kind of organized sessions would have been set up.
I quite liked the 'format', but it has the downside of working best for
people who know each other already: People who often only meet at
conferences and then don't find enough time to have a good chat. This
day offered a good chance for that.
PETS is a great event, and I think it is a good idea to make a pre-event
meetup a regular thing. Many people didn't show up because they heard
about it too late and could not change their travel plans, but if we
announce it early enough the next time (via PETS channels?) I bet even
more people will show up. I don't know how to best name the event so it
becomes clear that it is meant for people already active in the field,
less as a newcomer thing. In the end, I was happy about the balance, but
of course some visitors expected a more structured event and had a bit
of a hard time joining ongoing small group discussions.
Regardless of whether you were there or not: Let me know what you think
about these kinds of meetups, and whether they're worth having!

The whole process is open; Tor may sometimes be slow at making any
design decisions, exactly because they want everything to be backed by
proper research.  is a repository of a lot
of papers, and the research community obviously has a close eye on Tor
and alternative designs. Many people, like me, coming from a computer
science/privacy research background, can evaluate the decisions and so
far there is no evidence that Tor doesn't try its best.
Everyone is aware of the bad situation of the US government funding
almost every serious venture in privacy these days, but EU funding is
awarded very differently and hard to acquire as a free software project.
If you have a good idea where to get independent funding, we could even
start a completely non-US dependent entity to work on Tor.
Tor never tried to hide the US background and its funding sources. Of
course, there is always a (maybe subtle) influence by a funder, but in
general Tor writes the proposals and the deliverables and does it in a
very sane way.
This FUD comes up quite often these days, one must wonder if there's
some controlled media campaign going on. Then again, random journalists
come across this non-story all the time.

Wrong. It certainly makes a lot of sense to use Tor even if the
communication partners know and can identify each other. Tor will
provide location anonymity, and hide the communication ("who is
communication with whom, and how often"). This is _the_ major selling
point of Tor, escaping surveillance. Anonymity is just the baseline you
need to then establish communication on top of it. Don't make the
mistake of reducing Tor to "two people that don't know each other can
communicate, and get a random nickname each time".
This is not anonymity, but pseudonymity! You usually do want a
persistent identifier.

My biggest worries are unattended upgrades, that they have to rely on
someone (you?) to provide up-to-date packages and hardware support for
the complete life-cycle. 64MB RAM may be enough for a Tor client,
although I'm a bit skeptical whether it can scale to more than a few
concurrent users. It is definitely not enough for a Tor bridge or
non-exit relay.
I am also not a fan of transparent proxying, but you are aware of the
issues there. I think it's irresponsible to throw people at the changed
threat model of Tor without telling them. I'd rather want to see a
captive portal that let's you download Tor and browse the Tor website,
and then lets Tor clients out. You say people are too stupid to run Tor
Browser. I think if you give them a nice tutorial on a captive portal,
they will manage. With the added benefit of educating these people so
they can also use Tor at different non-torified locations in the future.
It is not trivial to only allow Tor out (with all the pluggable
transports and things), but it can be done.
I do want a "Tor box" that has both this type of guest network with
captive portal, as well as enough power to be both a bridge or a relay.
It then needs some nice web user interface (with Tor stats!), a
mechanism to determine its own preferred state when not configured
otherwise (bridge/relay/client-only), and some fancy LEDs or display to
show how much you're helping the network. Yours cannot be that, so I'm
not really interested.
I also don't understand why everyone thinks they have to build their own
hardware. There are quite a number of open hardware platforms nowadays
that can be used for such a project just fine. Then you relieve yourself
of having to support that piece of hardware forever, manage production
and shipping and all that crap, but instead can focus on the important
parts, which is to make the software flexible enough to be moved from
one hardware platform to another, make nice interfaces, and work with
torproject.org to provide updates. The web GUI has been a proposed GSOC
project for quite some time, but no student picked it up yet. Does your
board even have LEDs?
You talk about adding exit relays, which is a nice thing to think about,
but as noted previously, if you don't talk about bandwidth and location,
that doesn't mean a thing.
I am not a hardware expert, but I have followed quite a number of
hardware-related kickstarters over time, and your timeline sounds really

Reply-To: 	P2P Foundation mailing list Call for papers for an /ephemera /special issue on:
  The social productivity of anonymity
*Issue Editors: *G?tz Bachmann and Andreas Wittel
Anonymity is deeply tied to the European values of liberty, equality and
fraternity. Concealing one?s identity can enable freedom (as in the
anonymity of speech), support equality (e.g. in anonymous application
procedures), and provide the basis for non-reciprocal relationships as
expressed in the value of brotherhood (e.g. asking a stranger for
directions). It is capable of traversing cultural differences and is
essential for many contemporary forms of sharing, communality and
collaboration (e.g. commons based peer production such as Wikipedia
entries and open-source software). However, it is also contested and,
indeed, under threat: networked databases, biometric identification and
surveillance technologies such as CCTV are matched by discourses that
condemn anonymity and celebrate transparency and openness. Legal,
technological and moral imperatives towards transparency contribute to a
process in which anonymity is increasingly under attack. As a
consequence, the ?end of anonymity? has been declared in public
discourses, not only since the revelations of Edward Snowden. However,
this claim deserves to be scrutinised a bit further.
Using a more analytical perspective, it becomes apparent that anonymity
constitutes a specific form of social relation in which potentially
identifying markers of individuality and difference are dissociated from
specific individuals and collectives. This has the effect of creating
situational, relational and partial forms of unknowability,
invisibility, and untrackability (Nissenbaum, 1999; Ponesse, 2013). As
contemporary societies are increasingly based on networked
infrastructures we face new questions of how information, property and
people can be disconnected. This holds true with regard to phenomena
such as the international activist network Anonymous, internet-based
communication, and forms of ?algorithmic anonymity? (Rossiter and Zehle,
2014). The social, moral, and legal significance of anonymity is also
reflected in such controversial domains as baby drop-off boxes and
anonymous births, the anonymous donation of organs, gametes, and blood,
as well as peer reviewing and application procedures.
Research into current transformations of anonymity at the intersections
of technologies/infrastructures and politics is surprisingly thin.
Empirical scholarship is fragmented and theoretical conceptualizations
are rare (Nissenbaum, 1999; Frois, 2009; Wiedemann, 2012; Ponesse,
2013). With a perspective on everyday social and cultural practices
future research will be able to build on a number of ethnographies such
as Konrad?s work on egg donation (2005), Copeman?s comparative inquiries
into blood donation (2009), Frois? exploration of anonymity in self-help
groups (2009), Lock?s ethnography of organ transplantation (2002), and
Coleman?s study of hackers who operate under the Anonymous label (2010,
2013). While these studies provide some methodological and theoretical
groundwork, none of them has addressed anonymity in its full complexity,
nor have they linked constellations of anonymity regimes across
different case studies.
To collect insights into the ways in which anonymity is modified,
maintained or abandoned in contemporary online-offline worlds, this
special issue will combine three areas of research into anonymity: (1)
research into technologies and infrastructures of information,
communication, surveillance and identification; (2) research into the
regulation, ethics and politics of anonymity; and (3) research into the
everyday practices of anonymity ranging from sperm donation to social
media, from peer review to police work, from political mobilisation to
self-help groups.
While anonymity is a deeply ambivalent social form we are particularly
interested in contributions that defend anonymous interactions. Can we
develop a concept of anonymity that emphasises its cultural and
political values and its social productivity? Can we demonstrate that
anonymity enhances, enriches and strengthens the social?
We welcome contributions from a wide range of disciplines, looking for
  *
    Enquiries into the technical dimensions of anonymity: What forms of
    standards, protocols, software designs, technologies and aesthetics
    are shaping anonymity? How are they designed, decided upon,
    regulated and changed?
  *
    Ethnographic case studies into local formations of anonymity,
    especially those that connect online-based forms of anonymity with
    offline practices.
  *
    Case studies on the macro and micro-politics of anonymity,
    especially when anonymity becomes problematic. What undermines
    anonymity in specific settings, who develops strategies in its
    defence and to what aim?
  *
    Research into activist tactics and strategies for enabling
    anonymity, and attempts to raise the public socio-technical literacy
    with regard to managing identifying information (for example
    cryptoparties).
  *
    Research into the legal, moral or ethical principles and
    (historical) discourses, and how they are enacted, reflected,
    criticized or recreated by heterogeneous actors while doing/undoing
    anonymity.
  *
    Theoretical and empirical articles on the properties of anonymity,
    such as blockages of tracing identification, continuities between
    past and present and the prevention of reciprocity, and anonymity?s
    duration, (non-)reversibility and dynamics.
  *
    Theoretical and empirical articles on ways in which anonymity
    connects to concepts and practices of the person, the self, the
    social, of private/public constellations, of statehood, property and
    the commons.

For some reason this seems to be a Hot Topic these days. There are quite
some unsolved research questions, for example how payment and path
selection can be sufficiently separated to not endanger anonymity. In a
network where some people pay and others don't, you separate the groups
into subsets. It becomes even harder/easier to detect if you expect some
kind of return from your payment in the form of 'premium service'. Rob
Jansen wrote a nice roundup of current research papers:
I'm happy to discuss this further in person, but as a quick summary: I'm
not really happy about any of the ideas, for social reasons: If we lose
the social factor ("I run my relay because of the warm fuzzy feeling"),
we also lose the quite beneficial peer pressure ("I don't log or
manipulate stuff because Roger will hate me"). Financial incentives
cannot be the driving factor also because, even if you manage to include
all the "technical" diversity factors (you don't want all relays
concentrated in a couple of cheap places), and if you put a hard limit
on how much a single operator can earn, it is hard to protect against a
sybil attack ("I run 90% of the Tor network by simulating to be 100
operators and get all the money (and traffic)"). The anonymizer JAP
tried the commercialization route, and it mostly failed, even though
many argue that they had the better design. I don't think there's a lot
of money to be made in the first place, at the same time volunteers
might step away ("I'm not in it for the money, but now people can do it
for money, so why keep my relay running."), both also reasons why I'm
not really enthusiastic about the whole thing.

Essential to the torservers.net idea is to teach others to run relays
and share expertise. I put up a "How to get from a Debian base install
to a 'complete' Tor exit relay" since the beginning. Most of our partner
orgs are actively involved in local outreach and serve as points of
contacts for other relay operators. We receive roughly one mail every
second week to support@ from someone who asks us for help in setting up
their own relays. Also, obviously, having more orgs run around telling
people "You have to run relays!" is helpful. :) Over time, we handed out
a couple of thousand "Run a Tor relay" posters.
Long story short, even if you filtered out the actual relays run by all
our partners, it not necessarily reflects "this is what would have
happened without them".
While we're at "how to grow the network": One idea that has been around
for long time is to provide abuse handling services and legal protection
("Put our data into your WHOIS and we will take care of 99% of the
trouble; also, for the remaining 1%, we will pay a lawyer and help you
find one."). This is possible, and I believe it would be very helpful in
growing exit relays, but I personally can't take it on at the moment.
I would still be quite interested in a (pie?) chart that shows
guard/middle/exit capacity per family, ideally over time. I haven't seen
any "per family" analysis.

We're not machines, and this is not a commercial product where you can

Tor simply acts as a transport for TCP packets from source to
destination. You can run anything that consumes and produces TCP packets
on the hidden service side, so, yes, CGIs will work just fine.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor relay on home computer 
Maybe. I don't know of a single case where that happened.
Yes. I would advise against running an _exit_ relay, but a non-exit
relay does not result in any complaints.
Unfortunately, there is a small number of sites that block your IP even
if you're running a non-exit relay, because they get some random shady
blocklist that lists all Tor relay IPs and don't understand the difference.
I don't think this is true. Just being one of the thousands of relays
does not put you in the focus of any law enforcement. Exit relays, yes,
but not non-exit relays. Daniel didn't mention exit.
As an answer to the original question: Tor is pretty good at detecting
changing IPs, so that is a non-issue. In order to be helpful to the
network, you should have at least around 1 Mbit/s of upstream, and, yes,
the relay should be up continuously.
I think it doesn't help us if we mix non-exit relaying and exit relaying
into one big "Why you should not run relays at home". Home relays are
quite helpful actually, because they help create a nice diverse network,
and dynamic IPs are great, because when they get blocked somewhere it is
no big deal, the relay will get a new IP  eventually and become
reachable again.
I'm all for more home relays on the network! Just probably not exits.
Bridges are great, too.

I call it DMCA spam. Spam sent by a botnet: They scrape IPs from torrent
trackers and send out unsolicited email. Their reply-to address is a
blackhole. Even after you explain why you're legally not responsible for
Tor traffic, they keep sending those emails. I don't see any legal
responsibility to react to every single one of them after a couple. Some
of our larger ISPs tried to approach them as well, and then as final
step blackholed the spam.
The legal situation is pretty much the same in all Western countries.

Depends on your definition of threats. In Germany, some lawyers send out
(a lot of) threatening letters where they say that you're legally
responsible for your traffic regardless of who initiated it, and make it
sound like you have to pay some fee or they will go to court. With a
short deadline. If you reply and explain Tor, they usually drop it, or
threaten you again. In the end, it's all about the percentage of people
who simply pay the couple of hundred Euros of fees to avoid further
'trouble'. There hasn't been a single case of a Tor exit operator being
convicted for running a Tor relay. (*)
Even in France, with the HADOPI law ("Three Strikes"), there's an
exception for relaying other people's traffic. Of course, or there
simply would not be an Internet at all if everyone were responsible for
everyone else's traffic.
We need more relays, and while it is good to point to the Exit Relay
Guidelines and that they probably don't want to run an exit relay at
home unless they have a really good and small ISP. Usually, what most
people mean by "running a relay" is "running a non-exit relay", and that
must be encouraged!
(*) You may have heard of William. He wasn't convicted in his capacity
as exit operator. It's a very muddled case.

security and stability. The major BSD projects include FreeBSD, NetBSD
and OpenBSD, with a number of tangential projects including pfSense,
FreeNAS and PC-BSD. BSD software such as OpenSSH is the default
communication tool for innumerable devices on the internet. And BSD
software is renowned for its role in internet operations since its
earliest days.
The Tor Project plays a critical role in anonymity and privacy
solutions. With ever-increasing surveillance and censorhip, Tor is a
vital tool, and the project has grown by leaps-and-bounds since its
origin as a US Naval Labs project in the 1990?s. Hundreds of thousands
rely on Tor?s operation in a world filled with threats to anonymity and
While recognizing that the Tor Project is an admirable project that is
open source and well-documented with a vibrant community, we also worry
about the overwhelming GNU/Linux monoculture that is an Achilles? Heel.
Monocultures in nature are dangerous, as vulnerabilities are held in
common across a broad spectrum. Diversity means single vulnerabilities
are less likely to harm the entire ecosystem. In a global anonymity
network, monocultures are potentially disastrous. A single kernel
vulnerability in GNU/Linux that impacting Tor relays could be
devastating. We want to see a stronger Tor network, and we believe one
critical ingredient for that is operating system diversity.
There are three aspects of the TDP?s approach:
 *  to increase the number of Tor relays running BSDs, focused on the
server/network layer
 *  to develop a solid, Tor-compatible browser easily portable to other
POSIX-based operating systems, focused on the client layer
 *  to engage the broader BSD community about the Tor anonymity network
Currently, the TDP implementation plan includes:
 *  documentation for configuring FreeBSD and OpenBSD relays
 *  the creation of an OpenBSD port for the Tor Browser Bundle
 *  various events for engaging BSD users about Tor, including
birds-of-a-feather sessions and informal meetings

@_subject: [tor-talk] Wired: "The Dark Web as You Know It Is a Myth" 
WIRED Opinion -- Joseph Cox is a journalist covering the intersection of
technology, crime and politics.
The ?dark web? may be close to becoming a household name. After the
conviction of Ross Ulbricht, the owner of the drug marketplace Silk
Road, and a stream of articles claiming that the Islamic State is using
secret websites to plan out attacks, this hidden part of the Internet is
being talked about more than ever.
But for the most part, the story you?ve been sold about the dark web is
a myth.
I know this because I?ve been there. Since 2013, I?ve interviewed the
staff of drug marketplaces about their paid DEA double-agents, tracked
how technologically sophisticated pedophiles cover up their tracks, and
also discovered that active Uber accounts were being sold on the dark
web for as little as a dollar each. I?ve also learned that the real
story is not at all the one you commonly hear?the tale of a gigantic
space below our usual web, where hard-to-find vices are traded among
sordid individuals totally beyond the grasp of the authorities. That is
not what the dark web is.
The Rest of the Web Is Just as ?Dark?
Read nearly any article about the dark web, and you?ll get the sense
that its name connotes not just its secrecy but also the low-down dirty
content of its shadowy realms. You?ll be told that it is home to several
nefarious things: stolen data, terrorist sites, and child porn. Now
while those things may be among what?s available on the dark web, all
also are available on the normal web, and are easily accessible to
anyone, right now, without the need for any fancy encryption software.
For years there have been sites where you can instantly buy a stranger?s
Social Security Number, date of birth, full name, address and phone
number for under a dollar, or others that host reams of stolen credit
card details, ripe for a fraudulent spending spree.
Terrorist forums are also hiding in full view of anyone with an Internet
connection. Regular websites allow extremist supporters and prominent
jihadis alike to communicate with one another and post brutal propaganda
videos. Al Qaeda?s first forum was launched way back in 2001, and
although that site was shut down, a handful of other violent Islamic
extremist sites continue to exist on the normal web and are used heavily
today. Shutting these sites down is ?like a game of whack-a-mole,? Evan
Kohlmann from Flashpoint, an intelligence company, told me last year.
Despite reports, there are only shreds of evidence that the Islamic
State is using the dark web. One apparent fund-raising site highlighted
by the Washington Post had managed to garner exactly 0 bitcoins at the
time of writing, and this was also the case with another I discovered
recently. It?s worth pointing out that both of those sites simply
claimed to be funneling the cash to the terrorist group, and could
easily have been fakes. The one Islamic extremist dark web site to
actually generate any revenue mustered only $1,200 earlier this year.
Even it doesn?t explicitly mention the Islamic State.
And yes, child porn is accessible on the normal web. In fact, it is
rampant when compared with what?s available from hidden sites. Last
year, the Internet Watch Foundation, a charity that collates child
sexual abuse websites and works with law enforcement and hosting
providers to have the content removed, found 31,266 URLs that contained
child porn images. Of those URLs, only 51 of them, or 0.2 percent, were
hosted on the dark web.
It?s More Like a Dark Nook
What we call the dark web is tiny. The World Wide Web has swelled to
over a billion different sites, while current estimations put the number
of Tor hidden sites at between 7000 and 30,000, depending on what
methodology you follow. That?s 0.03 percent of the normal web. Barely a
fraction of content available elsewhere. The collection of all these
hidden sites is not, as is commonly spouted by governments and many
members of the media, several orders of magnitude larger than the normal
It?s not clear how many people access the dark web on a daily basis, but
there?s the impression that it?s a small number of individuals. The Tor
Project claims that only 1.5 percent of overall traffic on its anonymity
network is to do with hidden sites, and that 2 million people per day
use Tor in total. In short, the number of people visiting the dark web
is a fraction of overall Tor users, the majority of whom are likely just
using it to protect their regular browsing habits. Not only are dark web
visitors a drop in the bucket of Tor users, they are a spec of dust in
the galaxy of total Internet users.
It?s Not Impenetrable
Finally, the dark web is not some zone beyond the reach of law
enforcement. Although Ross Ulbricht is the most famous dark web
personality to get busted, he is far from the only one. Over 300
dark-web-affiliated people have been arrested since 2011, according to
independent researcher Gwern Branwen. Dealers of drugs and guns, people
who order illegal narcotics, and the staff and administrators of sites
have all been successfully apprehended by police. However, this number
should be considered as the ?lower-limit? Branwen previously told me,
because it only includes those arrests that are related specifically to
the dark web markets and which are publicly known.
The people who run child abuse websites or produce illegal material are
also being caught. In October 2014, a Brazilian dark web pedophile site
was seized, and 55 people arrested. Then just last month Australian
police went public about an operation that had shut down one of the
largest child abuse sites in existence. Just like in the physical world,
it turns out that some traditional police tactics, such as going
undercover, are incredibly effective against criminals on the dark web.
So What the Hell Is the Dark Web?
Of course, there is a technological space called the dark web, where the
servers of websites are hidden behind a veil of cryptography, and users
also enjoy strong anonymity protections. But that space is nothing like
the fairy tale that has been concocted around it; that of a colossal
ocean of digital stores selling exclusive products, where criminals are
free from prosecution. That characterization is not true.
Instead, the dark web is a small collection of sites that reflect the
limited number of good, bad, and downright weird humans that use it.
Doctors can give impartial advice to drug users, who come out of the
woodwork because of the anonymity awarded to them by Tor; Chinese
citizens can discuss whatever they like and circumvent The Great
Firewall, and, yes, the dark web is also used to host some seriously
depraved sites, such as extreme pornography. At the moment, the space is
probably used mostly for criminal purposes, but its relevance to the
world of cybercrime and other domains has been grossly exaggerated.
Looking beyond the scaremongering, however, the dark web actually has
promise. In essence, it?s the World Wide Web as it was originally
envisioned: a space beyond the control of individual states, where ideas
can be exchanged freely without fear of being censored. As countries
continue to crack down on the web, its dark counterpart is only going to
become more relevant as a place to discuss and connect with each other.
We shouldn?t let the myth of the dark web ruin that potential.

@_subject: [tor-talk] USB sticks for Tails (write protection switch) 
It's been a while, and a lot of people have since asked if I can repeat
the action: I plan to do another bulk order of USB sticks with physical
write protection switch. They are certainly not perfect, and there's no
guarantee that there aren't any software-based attacks possible! (**)
Still, they are definitely 'more useful' than regular USB sticks with no
write-protection whatsoever.
I will order only one model this time. I believe they are the same than
the square ones last time, but I don't know for sure. Here's some data
from the last batch:
 ( the
blue ones on  ).
I will bring sticks with me to events. I will not put Tails on them, and
I will not repackage and mail them. I plan to give them away "as is" at
the price that I pay from the wholesale company in China. You can find
sellers on alibaba.com.
The price will be around 8 Euro for 16GB sticks. Last time I went for
the 8GB version, but it only makes ~1? difference these days. It largely
depends on the quantity, and obviously it can get cheaper the more I
buy. Please ask _organizations_ that would be interested so I can get a
rough idea of how many I should order. Last time I got 200, which were
gone astonishingly fast (I barely had any left after a single c3
congress). I need organizations/groups to commit to at least 25 sticks.
I don't have the energy to deal with smaller "orders". :-) The amount of
feedback I get to this will determine how many extra sticks I will buy.
I am tempted to at least go for 500.
I do not plan to print or engrave logos on them, so they don't "stick
out". If an organizations wants their logo on sticks, I can share my
Chinese contact and the org can order directly.
(**) Nobody has actually proven that you can circumvent the read-only
bit and simply write with modified kernel drivers ("please don't write
me bit", not enforced by the drive controller), and/or that you can
reflash the firmware in read-only mode. It sounds plausible that you
can, so I don't think that these USB sticks will protect against a
highly motivated attacker. "Safer" options I've heard so far, but have
not verified:
The (micro)SD exposes registers for permanent write protection (cannot
be undone) and temporary write protection. If you set TMP_WRITE_PROTECT
and expose the SD card as USB device (not as mmc card), the registers
cannot be accessed from the host, so they cannot be changed. For an
example of this, see  . Maybe
there's a nice little SD card USB reader with a firmware that can be
patched for this. Or someone finally does a kickstarter around proper
USB sticks, with open hardware, and better protection against rogue
firmware updates. It could then of course be based on flash memory
chips, not necessarily SD cards. I think it would be nice to find a
cheap, small, hackable SD-to-USB adapter.

Hi Thomas,
Great! I've been toying with the idea for quite a while now, too. Glad
that someone is picking it up. :-) It would be ideal to find a way to
make it hard even for yourself to find out whether a particular hidden
service is hosted by you. I didn't really spend too much time thinking
about it, but one idea I've had is to spin up and bootstrap 'remote' VM
instances (on servers maintained by third parties) that you than hand
over to individuals, complete with an interface for users to easily
generate more hostnames/virtual hosts on 'their' VM. Apart from some
update channels you could lock down the systems so you don't have easy
access. You could still check whether a certain VM has been paid for,
but you don't have to know about the hostnames generated on the VMs.
I don't see a good way to achieve this if you maintain the VM hosts
yourself. Maybe one can built it so users decrypt their hidden services
(keys) on reboot so they're only available in RAM.
If we think hard enough, there's probably a nice way to keep the
relationship of users (and their payments) and running hidden services
separate (or at least hard/expensive to recover).
Good luck!

I am not an authoritative source, but these are my thoughts around it
without speaking to anyone about it:
The difficulty with moving stuff to *.torproject.org is that nowadays,
with a lot of expectations of different groups and users towards the
project, you can't (don't want to) simply put things there that are not
'guaranteed to be maintained', at least in more degree than "this was
written by someone who appears to be fairly new to the community". It's
hard to find reliable maintainers for these type of things (we're
talking years or a decade), and it may be better to not have things than
to have things that people expect to be there and then they suddenly
break and nobody notices except your visitors and the only thing you can
do in response it shut it down.
I'd be more than happy to host it on torservers.net, it's a relay
related thing anyway! Opi, what do you think about

No, this is not possible in any useful way, sorry. You will mess with
user traffic, which is something you should never do. It will break
stuff for regular users. I strongly advise against this, and if it is
detected your relay will be blacklisted for exiting. Also, you might
open yourself to severe liability issues if you modify or influence
forwarded traffic. As an example, ?512 of the US DMCA law only applies
if "[...] the transmission, routing, provision of connections, or
storage is carried out through an automatic technical process without
selection of the material by the service provider" and "the material is
transmitted through the system or network without modification of its
content" [1]. Similar passages exist in any country where I have looked
at the laws, including all of European Union through 'harmonization' of
each countries laws to meet the requirements of the respective EU
directive [2]. The relevant laws of several countries are linked in the
"Tor Exit Guidelines" (please add more countries). [3]
What you should do instead is convince your ISP to have you listed as
the abuse contact for the IP address so you don't add to their workload.
Some ISPs have written scripts that forward abuse complaints to their
customers automatically based on custom IP addresses mentioned in the mails.

If you turn your Tor Browser into a relay, you need to keep the browser

Well, we do have "whois reassignment" and "create an organization" and
other things like that in the guidelines that are also aimed at reducing
this risk.
You can achieve something similar by placing your relay in a country
other than your own, without the need of complicated rulesets.
The only way I can see to try and achieve this would be GeoIP databases.
You know as much as I do that geoIP databases are very rough at best,
and I don't see how you would keep a geoIP database current across the
whole network. In practice, if you don't want to drop certain requests
as an exit, you cannot make it more than a "wish" of the exit relay that
a client may still violate. In many cases Tor already comes with or
suggests a GeoIP database (Tor Browser, relays).
Another argument for your suggestion would be that some day, traffic in
or to certain countries will be more troublesome than to others.
Something like this could also be used to influence your peering/transit
ratio to arrange cheaper deals.

No. TorChat is a third-party application that uses its own protocol. It

Not really. People use different clients, a popular one is irssi but it
needs some learning. In order to properly use IRC, you need a client
that stays connected 24/7. It does not help to pop into the chat and
then ask a question only to disconnect a few minutes later.
Conversations take place in an asychronous way, and often happen over
the course of multiple days.
TorChat is an unofficial messenger for 1:1 conversation that does not
support group chat and has not been approved or even looked at by Tor.
For a long time, there was no protocol specification, just the code, and
from a cursory look it seems to be still that way. I don't know anyone
who is using it. An alternative but (from the looks of it) similar
project is Ricochet,  , which has a specification
and is being developed by someone closer to the Tor team.

not want forks/duplicated packages (Firefox <-> TBB).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Some thoughts about Tor Project 
Hi juanjo,
Welcome! :)
The decision is hard to make across all users. You want a uniform
strategy for all 2 million+ users. Crossing country borders might
actually make it legally and technically *more* easy for your adversary
to collect and analyze traffic. If, say, all relays in your circuit
happen to be on ISPs that peer with each other, there might not be a
tapping device installed at all in between those. Internet routing is
But, yes, for many users it may be useful to cross borders. You seem to
be interested in anonymity, so you will love
 :-)
 is a quite good
overview paper that looks at the problem you touch.
While I agree that for many users crossing borders might be useful, I am
not sure this is the perfect strategy for everyone. We had a script to
distribute donations that we receive as Torservers, and as a first
approximation the money you would get would be higher if the exit relay
was in a country with low total exit capacity. You might like it.
Unfortunately it is buggy, someone should do a rewrite and potentially
work in more criteria.
There is also  , a project that awards
"points" based on some of the potential criteria.
Some time ago, researchers from Ruhr-University mentioned on tor-dev@
that they were working on something like it. Pond was a similar
experiment. I would love to see high-latency support integrated in Tor,
but there's a lot of open research questions. Maybe, if you have time to
dig into this, a great outcome would be to bug Tor developers and
collect all the open questions and potential design decisions into a
wiki page!

It is slowly spreading :) Take it on and get in touch with local libraries!
It's worse, the instructions on the website are quite outdated. It's a
surprise we even have bridges with latest pluggable transports...
Yes, this is actively being worked on.
Great feedback, great questions and comments! Spot on! :)

know you, Joe, are aware of that, but others who follow this thread
might not be so I wanted to mention it.

So, one thing, and the most important one, is that tor-project is for
non-technical discussions "about the Tor Project". Which can be a lot of
things, but it should not be technical discussions (tor-dev), relay
operation discussions (tor-relays), onion service stuff (tor-onions),
but also not anything else related to Tor the software, but Tor the
project. Which basically means the website, organizational stuff, etc etc.
The archive and subscription is public, so everyone can have a look at
what has been discussed there so far. There is a lot of overlap with
things that used to be covered on tor-talk and still are, and the
distinction is not clear at all. But, on the other hand, going through
the archives you can probably identify a lot of things that are
"accepted" on tor-talk that don't fit the range of topics covered on
tor-project (-- and not the other way round).
Not only partly, but mostly. :( A lot of people just didn't want to cope
with the amount of off-topic threads, nonconstructive endless debates
and other violations of netiquette that happened on tor-talk. tor-talk
degenerated quite a bit over time, and due to the libertarian nature of
a lot of people nobody stepped up and intervened until only a short
while ago. Users of tor-talk cannot be fully blamed because for a long
time there were no clear guidelines on what is acceptable behavior and
topics on it (which there still aren't) and no moderation. Sane people
just gave up and moved to a moderated list, which is tor-project.
Everyone, especially the active Tor contributors, want tor-talk to
become as useful again as it has been a long time ago, but only very few
of them are remaining as subscribers, and less than a handful are
reading or writing on it. If we manage somehow to get this back to a
list with meaningful discussions and content, other Tor contributors
will come back, but the ball is in our hands; we can't "demand" that
they come back to a list full of crap, given the desire for effective
and efficient collaboration.
There is no clear policy for tor-project and everyone acknowledges
that "actively contributing to Tor" can mean a lot of different things.
Maybe a good approach is that if you feel like you have something
constructive to add to a thread, and are capable of properly quoting
relevant parts of an email and your mail client is able to keep
threading intact, feel free to reply and the chances of the mail and
eventually your address being accepted by one of the moderators is
pretty high. It is not meant to exclude anyone, but sometimes it _is_
better to have a noise-free channel for only those that actively follow
a certain topic or discussion, and not mixing active work with
education. The educational side is important, and is in many respects
covered by it having a public archive. If you feel you have a
contribution to make, but don't feel "authorized" to directly post to
tor-project, and you don't want to annoy all the "professionals", you
can also always quote from tor-project and simply post your comment to
Does this help?

Hi Joe,
I agree with what you wrote. The topic comes up at every dev meeting,
but we have not found a way to address that problem, or, phrased
differently, it is unclear what path to take.
Personally, I believe a mailinglist is a poor tool for support questions
(and answers). Some of the problems are: Archives are a pain to search,
older posts are a pain to reference, most people want a questions
answered and get freaked out if they get a flood of messages that are
not relevant to their current question, etc.
That's one of the reasons why Tor created . I'm not saying it is the perfect answer, far from it, but I think it's
a fine platform and it could use a way larger number of people answering
questions (a problem any other platform will have, too). Also, I've been
advocating for a "support portal" for years, and there seems to be some
traction now to finally get one online. I don't know what it will look
like, but at least from the "technical support" side of things, it will
help a lot more users than those who are comfortable using mailing lists
these days. I'm not saying I like that, I do embrace mailing lists, but
I accept that most of Tor's users hate them or at least don't understand
them well enough.
That being said, tor-talk is now moderated, sort of. A few annoying
fellows were asked to find some other forum for their rants. I also try
and tell people within Tor that unless _they_ come back and use this
list as a forum for their conversations, we cannot expect it to become
better. The other chance is for all the people who still follow this
list to use it more and try and answer questions that come up or
politely point to relevant resources, even if it does not immediately
bring back "the hardcore Tor experts".
I think this is happening here as well. Even if people might be too busy
to reply, more Tor people than you think still at least read it, and
more often than not pick up things from here to other Tor people.
I totally agree, and this is being worked on. I wished this list would
be used by more Tor folks, and the plans and ideas for improving support
channels could easily have happened here, but I also acknowledge that we
have quite a number of new(-generation?) Tor folks who are not into
mailing lists (or IRC!). Crazy, I know, but that's how it is. :-)

Tor exit node operator arrested in Russia - a solidarity Tor Relay
Challenge launched
Fr 14 April 2017 by xeniax, serrObengbi, 1up
Run a Tor relay or exit node in solidarity with Dmitry Bogatov!
On April 12, Russia celebrated Yuriy Gagarin’s first flight in space. In
the meanwhile, a young Russian scientist, mathematician and FOSS
activist Dmitry Bogatov spends the Space Day in detention center. His
involvement in decentralized web projects, his interest to privacy and
anonymity, his activities as an administrator of tor exit node have
brought him under suspicion of the FSB. Accused of “incitation to
terrorism” because of some messages posted from his IP address, he will
stay detained till June 8 at least, and risks up to 7 years in prison if
the Investigation committee ‘proves’ his guilt.
Though, the very nature of Bogatov case is a controversial one, as it
mixes technical and legal arguments, and makes necessary both strong
legal and technical expertise involved. Indeed, as a Tor exit node
operator, Dmitry does not have control and responsibility on the content
and traffic that passes through his node: it would be the same as
accusing someone who has a knife stolen from her house for the murder
committed with this knife by a stranger. In the past other exit node
operators in Russia had conversations with police. For example, Sergey
Matveev aka Stargrave been witnessing several times on the cases related
to the crimes commited under his IP adress (mostly, related to financial
fraud and hacking). Though, as Sergey states himself, he “has never been
accused, but was only a witness”, as his cases were not related to
“extremism” On 2016-02-02 his devices were seized for 2 weeks for
inspection but he has never been detained, after explaining to the
police how Tor actually works.
Russia counts 230.000 Tor users everyday and only 46 exit nodes. Tor is
extremely popular after a bunch of laws restricting usage of Internet
and enforcing the lawful interception procedures (obliging ISPs to store
all metadata for 3 years, and the traffic - even though encrypted - for
6 months). However, the Bogatov case has had an influence on the
perception of Tor by ‘end users’. We’ve observed several group chats on
Russian most popular IM app, telegram, dedicated to anti-Putin protests:
these chats gather from +500 to +1500 users, and a lot of them use
different privacy enhancing tools. The Bogatov case was discussed
widely. These discussions have shown that users do not fully understand
the difference between running a relay and an exit node, and also
between relay operators and tor browser users. They perceive Tor as
being vulnerable to deanonymization. Misunderstanding, lack of feedback
from Tor community or ‘expert’ users underrepresented in these chat
rooms leads the discussion to a very dangerous direction: “we do not
care about hiding things, because the police will anyway find everything
about us - even Tor is not secure”.
Tor activists have launched a flashmob - “Run a relay in solidarity with
Bogatov”. By April 13, in only 1 day, 18 new relays have been set up in
different countries, wearing names like freeBogatov and KActionLibre,
referring to Bogatov’s handle famous in FOSS and GnuPG forums. Bogatov’s
personal exit node that he had been running from his own house was also
wearing the ‘kaction’ name. It is the first flashmob that uses relays as
form of international solidarity and the nicknames of relays become a
means to transmit a message: Bogatov is part of the community, he is a
valuable, trusted person who has been contributing to various open
source projects and is recognized as a professional. Tor community also
works on technical proof/explanations to help users and Bogatov’s
lawyers to understand that, by the very architecture of Tor network,
Bogatov can not be responsible for the things he is accused of. He also
has alibi: he was absent when the messages were published, and video
recordings from surveillance cameras are in posession of Bogatov’s
lawyer. Another proof of Bogatov’s innocence is the fact that the user
continued posting incendiary messages after Bogatov has been arrested.
Also, the style of writing, the language, orthography do not correspond
to Bogatov’s style - this can be proven by psycholinguistic expertise.
However, FSB does not want to stop the process - they investigate the
version of “terrorism”, that would mean a very hard penalty for Dmitry,
and also does not correspond to technical, legal, psychological, social
situation. The judge also claimed to not trust Dmitry because of his
”high skills in new technologies” that may potentially help him “erase
traces of his crimes” - to prove this weird hypothesis, the
Investigation Committee has withdrawn all the technical equipment from
Dmitry’s apartment - from USB drives to laptops, smartphones and cameras…
If you can, run a relay or an exit node and give it a name that contains
Bogatov or KAction (Bogatov’s handle). By running more relays we
increase anonymity and also show solidarity and demonstrate the power of
shared responsibility.
Tor relays are publicly available for everyone to use
The IP addresses of the Tor relays (middle relays and exit nodes) are
publicly available and can be freely used by the tor users. The fact
that relays are a publicly available resource doesn’t minimize or
threatens the anonymity of a tor user in fact it can be used as a proof
that an IP address of a server was a Tor at a given time.
Currently running Tor relays are enumerated to Atlas, a web application
to learn about currently running Tor relays. In a similarly way the
ExoneraTor service maintains a database of IP addresses that have been
part of the Tor network. It answers the question whether there was a Tor
relay running on a given IP address on a given date. ExoneraTor may
store more than one IP address per relay if relays use a different IP
address for exiting to the Internet than for registering in the Tor
network, and it stores whether a relay permitted transit of Tor traffic
to the open Internet at that time. Exonerator is a web service that can
check if an IP address was a relay at a given time.
A different type of relays; bridges are Tor relays that aren’t listed in
the public Tor directory. That means that ISPs or governments trying to
block access to the Tor network can’t simply block all bridges. Bridges
are useful a) for Tor users in oppressive regimes, and b) for people who
want an extra layer of security because they’re worried somebody will
recognize that it’s a public Tor relay IP address they’re contacting.

Short version
Run a Tor relay or exit node in solidarity with Dmitry Bogatov!
Tor activists launch a call to run relays and exit nodes in solidarity
with Dmitry Bogatov, a FOSS contributor, GnuPG and privacy advocate and
math teacher arrested and detained in Russia. By now 26 relays have been
set up in different countries.
Bogatov will stay in detention till June 8 at least. He risks up to 7
years in prison as he is accused of having published messages with
incitations to terrorism. A user ‘Airat Bashirov’ was indeed posting a
number of messages inciting to organize mass rallies and protests, using
Bogatov’s home IP adress. However, as a Tor exit node operator, Bogatov
can not have access or be responsible for the content that passes by:
Tor’s technical architecture is in itself a proof of his innocence.
As an active FOSS contributor, he also has a support from the peer
community and has a strong alibi - he was in the sport center and then
in the supermarket at the moment when the messages were published.
Moreover, after Bogatov’s arrest the same user continued posting
incendiary messages.
If you can, run a tor relay or an exit node and give it a name that
contains Bogatov or KAction (Bogatov’s handle). By running more relays
we increase anonymity and also show solidarity and demonstrate the power
of shared responsibility.

@_subject: [tor-talk] BitPay seems to be rejecting payments via Tor 
As Zwiebelfreunde/Torservers, we registered a Bitpay 'merchant' account
on 16.11.2016, and they shut us down on 31.1.2017.
I set it to accept payments instantly, and I configured that 'customers'
don't have a fill out the customer information form (since for us, it's
donations, and I don't care about double spending).
I did a first test "payment" on 18.11., of course via Tor. On
23.11.2016, they sent us a first "inquiry" regarding that transaction:
During a routine review of your merchant account associated with
[WEBSITE], we noticed some recent invoices, on which we need some
additional information by 30 November 2016. This type of transactional
inquiry is sent on an ongoing basis to all our merchants as part of our
routine monitoring program.
Could you please provide us with the following:
  * Copy of the invoice for the good/service provided (you can redact
the shopper information if you wish to do so);
  * Without relaying any confidential personal information, could you
let me know what type of information you obtained for this transaction
(e.g., shopper name, address, ID if any, etc.)?
I told them it was exclusively donations towards our non-profit, and
that we don't have any invoices or customer information. I pointed them
(again) at the donate.html page. The person wrote back "Thanks for the
follow-up! I don't have any other questions at this point."
We received donations on 6.12., 3.1. and 7.1, each without "customer
Then, on 24.1.2017, we got this:
Unfortunately, it has come to our attention that your business presents
a higher risk for us and therefore we will no longer be able to service
you. More specifically, we have seen a number of higher risk
transactions during our routine monitoring program and this has led to
the decision to close your account. Your pending funds will be fully
settled per your normal settlement instructions.
In order to give you the opportunity to take measures such as informing
your customers or looking for an alternative solution, the termination
of services will become effective as of 31 January 2017.
Please be sure to obtain any information that you might need from the
merchant dashboard within a week, as your account will be deactivated on
31 January 2017.
Please note our decision is final and a re-instatement of transaction
capabilities after 31 January 2017 is not possible.

No further updates from what we wrote in the blog: The case is pending
review by the Landgericht, until then everything else is blocked. They
accepted our request for "sealing" and cannot legally continue the
analysis until the court decision.
Unfortunately we cannot publish any of the communication yet, because it
is illegal to cite from documents in ongoing legal cases, but basically
we (our lawyers) are arguing that this was clear overreach and
disproportionate action against 'witnesses'.
