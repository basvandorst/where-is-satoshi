@_subject: [tor-talk] Netinfo cells 
It maybe a noobish question but, netinfo cells do send the OR address so
what I am missing? Because then you get every address of every node right?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor routing 
When a client creates a circuit, it sends cells with some CircuitID. How
are these cells routed?Are they routed by their CircuitID, the IP address
of the ORs or how?
Thanks in advance

@_subject: [tor-talk] Routing in tor 
Could anyone please explain me how the routing is done in Tor? How are
CircID and StreamID used? How when a extend cell is received that OR knows
to which OR has to send a create cell? Where are the IPs in the cells and
how one OR gets the info about the IPs of other OR?
Thanks in advance, I appreciate it

@_subject: [tor-talk] Defense against DDoS Attacks in Tor 
I am currently studying network security and I am focusing on defense
against DDoS attacks in Tor. I have read a few papers (replay attack,
sniper attack, etc.) but most of them are not recent. My aim is to develop
(theoretically or in practice) a defense but I would really appreciate if
you could tell me current attacks which have no defense or are the most
successful ones.
Thanks in advance,
Ignacio Gago

@_subject: [tor-talk] Second generation onion router 
Well, I have read "Tor: the second generation onion router" but it is from
2004, anything more recent about how Tor works? I am trying to understand
the Sniper Attack but need more information on how tor works to do so.
Also, any news about how op onymous managed to deanomyze those hidden
Thanks in advance.

So it wasn't a DDoS attack? They just did it reverse style, instead of
.onion->ip, they did ip-> .onion?

Does anyone know which type of DDoS attack was launched at Silk Road 2.0
before it was shutted down? I have read that it was very sophisticated.

I had read about slowloris before, but it was a HTTP DoS attack, don't know
what is the relation with Tor. About computational DDoS I have only read
about cell flood attack (2013) but it seems they propose a defense based on
puzzles. What i have not read anything about is DDoS attacks to hidden
services or rendezvouz points. If you could give me a little more
information i would really appreciate it.
