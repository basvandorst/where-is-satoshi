Tor does not protect information inside the protocols it carries. Users
must take care themselves when using unscrubbed information, or if they
are mixing anonymized traffic with other traffic since the connections
might share the same exit node.

@_subject: Reduced throughput with 0.1.1.14 
Not to make this a big issue but *if* you are so unfortunate that all
the Entry Guard nodes Tor-0.1.1.14 happen to pick are slow, you also
would get a worse throughput after this upgrade.
(It is unlikely that they all should be slow, but then random selection
is random...)

@_subject: Firefox through Tor 
Hi Eric,
This is an important feature announcement in an otherwise great extension:
If you have a homepage in the browser loaded upon startup, it does NOT
use the foxyproxy settings on this first page! A later reload will be
done through foxyproxy...
I guess people can see the potential problems themselves. Test
 as startup page.

@_subject: Firefox through Tor 
Hi Eric,
Yes, I am sure about that. When I start up Firefox I get the current IP
from ipid.shat.net and the status line tells me that I am using a remote
squid-proxy. When I press reload I get the proxy's IP address.
Same thing happens when I close Firefox and start up again so cache
should have been proxy now... It looks to be a sync problem with the
enabling of foxyproxy and the use of the home-page upon startup.
I am using an updated Dapper with Firefox 1.5.0.2
Best of luck with the testing! This is not a problem for me now that I
know about it, but it should not be there :)

Making your own certs don't fix this unless you distribute them to all
users offline! (Remember that the HTML-written fingerprint of the self
signed cert on the web site may as easily be replaced...)

@_subject: Norwegian DNS compromized 
This is probably a coincidence, but during and after my talk at HackCon
this month a technical guy from NextGenTel was furious over the use of
Tor, and wanted me to recommend not setting up Tor servers! He claimed
that the use of Tor at an ISP (he claimed this on behalf of every ISP)
was against the rules of the agreement with the end user and claimed to
have had lots of problems with Tor users.
One thing he specifically mentioned was the problem of blacklists
targeting IP-ranges within NextGenTel, where I calmly tried to explain
that the problem might be the blacklist operators. And that the solution
is not to ban Tor but to explain the Internet to these blacklists. I did
not get the names of any of the lists, but maybe someone reading this
have had similar experiences and can post a "list of these blacklists"?
BTW. Xiando: Does NextGenTel allow DNS queries to servers outside of
their network?

@_author: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Lasse_=D8verlier?= 
@_subject: Norwegian DNS compromized 
If this is true, the answer to the strange DNS query is likely that
NextGenTel is using a filter service developed by the Norwegian Police
on their DNS queries to stop this type of traffic. I think that being
registered here is a verification for that the address already is
reported to (at least) the Norwegian authorities.
BTW. This filter is possible to implement on exit nodes, but I have
found too little information on how the filter works. (Yes, I know, some
people think that all censorship is bad, but if they stop only reported
illegal sites, it might be worth discussing.)
Whether the or-talk list is the correct place for this I don't know, the
developers can stop the thread.
If we already stop spam and bittorrent I think this is much worse!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is this a practical vulnerability? 
In principle this is (as they write) very similar to earlier papers. The
major catch to their plan may be that if a hidden service already has
chosen its entry guards, and the "modified Tor nodes" are put out there
later - they ("malicious nodes") will therefore not be a part of the
path. But if they already have trusted entry nodes out there and the
client/hidden service selects by default Tor method - their attack (and
earlier ones) should be quite realistic.
Meaning that a hidden service should be very careful of which nodes it
selects as the entry node(s). Maybe Tor should *not* allow new entry
nodes (by default) to be added for hidden services upon unavailability
of old entry nodes because of this? Another option may be separation of
not trusting/adding new entry nodes for hidden services, but still do so
for the Tor client? (There is (was?) an option for StrictEntryNodes in
torrc which should be considered, but I seriously hope critical sites
are not hosted without deep knowledge of how the hidden services are
Be safe!

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden server path 
Your "weak" points are the client and (hidden) server - or most likely poor
server configuration. The rendezvous point only shuffles encrypted data and
will not see anything in plain text.
BUT. If your .onion server links to an outside page, includes an image,
script-file, whatever, externally - the HTTP Referer will give away the URL
to the other server if not properly sanitized by the client...
There is always room for misconfiguration ;-)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden server path 
It is the work of the client software. Many browsers let you turn off
referrer now. Neither the proxy nor Tor should (ever) be modified to do
this. They only transport the traffic data.
