@_subject: Patch: tor-0.1.1.23 spuriously killed slow directory connections 
close connections to directory servers that have been mute for more
than five minutes.  Instead, it closes such connections that were
opened more than five minutes ago, even if they are quite active
(because the code checks timestamp_lastwritten instead of
to download the ~300KB(?) of directory information, tor can loop
indefinitely, repeatedly downloading part of the directory
information and then restarting the query.
when tor stopped working on one of my internet links, but the bug
may have been there longer and only been triggered more consistently
as the amount of directory information grew.
tor daemons, noticed that tor had stopped working, and just switched
their browsers to "connect to internet directly", leaving tor
to continue to its directory server read loop.
I have verified that I can eventually get to a web site with this
