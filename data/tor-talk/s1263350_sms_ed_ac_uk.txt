@_subject: [tor-talk] CCC self-organised session - Tor research presentation 
Hello all,
Just a quick email for those attending 34C3 - I'll be presenting some initial findings from my sociological research on Tor at a self-organised session ("hackademia - research presentations") tomorrow (29th) at 10am in lecture room 14-15. Feel free to come along if you're interested, or have any questions - any feedback would be much appreciated!
Very best,

@_subject: [tor-talk] CCC self-organised session - Tor research 
Room 14-15 is on the top floor of the CCL building - the floor above the quadrature and the rights/freedoms bit. Look forward to seeing you there - there are a few of us presenting on our different research projects so there should be a good discussion.
Very best,
I am a newbie and would like to attend this. Where can I do it? What does
it mean by room 14-15?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Research presentation at the CCC 
Hello all,
I hope that this finds all of you well - as some of you may know, I'm a researcher at the University of Edinburgh and I've been conducting some sociological research with members of the Tor community over the last nine months or so. This has been going well - everyone I've spoken to has been extremely generous with their time and I really appreciate all the contributions I've had. I've conducted around 20 anonymous interviews so far with relay operators, developers and other members of the community and the Tor Project.
In the interests of feeding back some of my findings I had thought that I might submit a "work-in-progress" talk to this year's CCC on the research I've carried out so far. I thought that this might be a good opportunity to give something back to the community, to open some of my findings and research up to scrutiny and to invite discussion (while obviously strictly preserving the anonymity of respondents). I would of course make it clear that this research isn't affiliated with or carried out by the Tor Project.
The CCC is obviously a very meaningful event for the Tor Project and the Tor community more broadly and I wanted to signal my intentions here on the Tor-talk mailing list to get a sense of whether this would pose any difficulties for the community, make anyone uncomfortable, or just generally be felt to be inappropriate. If anyone has any objections or concerns about me submitting a talk about my research to one of the CCC streams for this year then I'd be very grateful if you could let me know before the call for papers ends on the 15th October and I can take it into consideration and discuss how best, or whether, to proceed.
Additionally, if anyone is interested in taking part in the research, doing an interview or generally has concerns or questions about the research then please feel free to get in touch.
Thank you again to everyone I've spoken to so far, and to the community in general for your patience with my emails!
Very best,
Ben Collier

Hi flipchan
Thanks, that's a good point - as a PhD researcher my completed thesis gets uploaded through our university library to  for free public access when I submit, so it should be openly accessible there. I'm also hoping to circulate my main findings to the community in a more accessible format (with less social sciences jargon) when the research is done. While I can't opensource my data (as the interviews are anonymous), I'm very happy to make my thesis freely and openly available in a way which ensures the anonymity of the respondents.
Very best,

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor sociological research - my thanks to the Tor 
Hello all,
I hope that this finds you all well! As some of you may know, I've been spending much of the past year carrying out interviews with people in the Tor community for my PhD research. This has been far more successful than I thought it might be at the outset, and I've been really struck by the generosity and kindness of the community over the last twelve or so months.
As things currently stand, I've carried out in the region of 25 interviews and heard from a really diverse range of people about how and why they contribute to Tor and the Tor network, their values, beliefs, working practices and perspectives. This email is largely to wish you all my heartfelt thanks, especially to those of you with whom I've corresponded in depth or carried out interviews. I really appreciate the time you've spent speaking to me, and I equally appreciate the patience of the community in general with my approach emails!
Though I've largely finished sending approaches to people for interviews, I'll still be carrying out fieldwork for the next four months, so if anyone is still potentially interested in speaking to me over voice chat or email about the research, I'd be delighted to talk to you - just let me know (all interviews are kept anonymous by default). Once I've analysed and written up my data, I'm hoping to share a lay summary here for anyone interested in the findings. As ever, if anyone has any concerns or questions about the research, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
Very best and many thanks again,
