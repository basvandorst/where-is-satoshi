Hash: SHA1
Well, I've just downloaded and installed "0.1.0.9-rc" forWin32.
"Looks like it's working" !
 I have not had any problems as far as Tor crashing or anything like
that. If there is a security hole or flaw somewhere in the design or
code- that would be something I as an ordinary user, would be unlikely
to catch (until to late!)
P.S. I managed to identify and successfully import the package signing
key but only after looking all over the download page (and all over
the Tor site) with no luck, for awhile. A link to the key (and maybe,
a simple 'how to" on checking sigs) might be useful to new users.

Yes. Thanks. It does -and as I suspected- it was there all along. On
another page with a link to another page.
rather than in the same location as the files and sigs. I should of
I'd seen it before, of course. Just couldn't remember quite where. So,
in the end -I fetched it from the server. Not a problem.
I suppose if you where starting from the FAQ and then on to the
download page, it makes sense.
However, I'm on a different box,- don't have the key- went to download
and thought- Wheres the keys?
Well, it's not a big deal and I hesitated to mention it, but it wasn't
obvious and I thought 'how frustrating" This should be fixed!
Anyway, thanks again, for pointing me in the right direction!

I am using TOR, Privoxy and PuTTY on a Windows box with XP SP2
Don't know if this is 'correct' but I tried (at first) pointing 'PuTTY'
at 'Privoxy'
on localhost:8118
That didn't work so, I pointed PuTTY at TOR listening on localhost:9050
(using the Socks 5 option in PuTTY) with "Do DNS lookup at proxy end"
set to auto.
It worked, but TOR responded with this msg.
"May 19 08:03:48.883 [warn] fetch_from_buf_socks(): Your application
(using socks5 on
port 22) is giving Tor only an IP address. Applications that do DNS
resolves themselv
es may leak information. Consider using Socks4A (e.g. via privoxy or
socat) instead."
Well, there is no 'Socks4A" option in PuTTY. (only 4 or 5)
So, with "Do DNS lookup at proxy end" set to "Yes"  it connected and no
warnings from TOR.
It seemed to work, though I don't know if it was 'correct' or if there
is a better way.
Any ideas?

Thank you!
 It is very, very slow (I'm on a dial-up)
 Logging into my shell account, I found it easier to use notepad and to
copy and paste my input,
 rather than to try typing directly. However, it does work!
P.S. (Adam) Sorry to reply to your mail directly. I meant to reply to
the list, but didn't catch it. Opps, I'm a newbie!
