as a general rule (older and more experienced minds can and probably will
disagree with me) any consistently updated *nix based OS (and by extension
*BSD) are safe against untargeted scrutiny. From what we know the various
TLAs have network taps, and so internet communication is where you are
vulnerable. changing network habits (to impede statistical analysis), and
using tor and a handful of other tools (tor, especially as a relay, and OTR
messaging come to mind first) you can minimize what the TLAs can gather on
you, but not stop it entirely. on the other hand a sudden spike of
encrypted traffic may make you more interesting from their point of view.
if you feel paranoid enough and have enough time to learn it you might
think about Gentoo Linux, only source is distributed, so all packages are
compiled in stiu, and are (theoretically) free of malware.

For say.. the CIA running a stringer out of china? its certainly cheaper
and more deniable than having them report to an embassy every couple of
months. for a deep cover agent in an allied country or a sleeper in a drug
cartel? you bet your best pair of running shoes that its part of the
operation security.

know its not exactly reputable, but as fast as this seems to be developing,
i dont think traditional news will be able to catch up for a week or so.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and Openssl bug CVE-2014-0160 
from  :
   1. *Clients*: Tor Browser shouldn't be affected, since it uses libnss
   rather than openssl. But Tor clients could possibly be induced to send
   sensitive information like "what sites you visited in this session" to your
   entry guards. If you're using TBB we'll have new bundles out shortly; if
   you're using your operating system's Tor package you should get a new
   OpenSSL package and then be sure to manually restart your Tor.
   2. *Relays and bridges*: Tor relays and bridges could maybe be made to
   leak their medium-term onion keys (rotated once a week), or their long-term
   relay identity keys. An attacker who has your relay identity key can
   publish a new relay descriptor indicating that you're at a new location
   (not a particularly useful attack). An attacker who has your relay identity
   key, has your onion key, and can intercept traffic flows to your IP address
   can impersonate your relay (but remember that Tor's multi-hop
designmeans that
attacking just one relay in the client's path is not very
   useful). In any case, best practice would be to update your OpenSSL
   package, discard all the files in keys/ in your DataDirectory, and restart
   your Tor to generate new keys.
   3. *Hidden services*: Tor hidden services might leak their long-term
   hidden service identity keys to their guard relays. Like the last big
   OpenSSL bug,
   this shouldn't allow an attacker to identify the location of the hidden
   service, but an attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can
   impersonate the hidden service. Best practice would be to move to a new
   hidden-service address at your convenience.
   4. *Directory authorities*: In addition to the keys listed in the
   "relays and bridges" section above, Tor directory authorities might leak
   their medium-term authority signing keys. Once you've updated your OpenSSL
   package, you should generate a new signing key. Long-term directory
   authority identity keys are offline so should not be affected (whew). More
   tricky is that clients have your relay identity key hard-coded, so please
   don't rotate that yet. We'll see how this unfolds and try to think of a
   good solution there.
   5. *Tails* is still tracking Debian oldstable, so it should not be
   affected by this bug.
   6. *Orbot* looks vulnerable; we'll try to publish more details here soon.
   7. It looks like most of the webservers in the
    rotation need upgrades too, and maybe we'll
   need to throw away our torproject SSL web cert and get a new one ?
   hopefully we'll deal with all that soon.

this just showed up on the cpunks mailing list, thought you might be
interested to know.
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Looks like Tor is now included as of build 23220. No GUI as of yet.

take a look here;  , while the
gaurdian project builds stuff on top of tor, they arent the same people.
