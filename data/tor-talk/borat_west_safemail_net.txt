@_subject: failed to choose an exit server 
I'm using Tor with default settings and I see a message: [warn] failed to choose an exit server.
That happens a lot lately and I don't know the cause of that message. Other than that it seems that my Tor client is working perfectly.
Can somebody help me to understand why is this happening and how to fix it?
