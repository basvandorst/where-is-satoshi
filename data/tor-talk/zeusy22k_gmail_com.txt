@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor blacklist 
I found that there is a blacklist in Tor system
I guess blacklist is like prison of onion routers. in other world, if
Tor system detect some onion router runs
abnormally, Tor system put that router in blacklist and never use again.
Is this true?
who manages the blacklist?
Once some onion routers are included into blacklist, Are they not able
to get out of blacklist??

@_subject: [tor-talk] How to designate specific node as exit node 
In Tor network
Is it possible to make specific node as exit node?
For example,
I have 2 PCs
Let's call them A and B.
A is just normal pc and B is used as exit node.
I always want to use B as exit node in Tor network.
In this situation,
what should I do?
I tried to change source code, but it didn't work
I really hope to get your advice.
Thank you.

@_subject: [tor-talk] [Question] Making private Tor network 
I am undergraduate student of SKKU, Korea
I am making private Tor network which consist of 5 nodes.
In this network, I split network two separate network with vlan function. In other word, OP and onion router 1 are involved in network 1, the others
are involved network 2.
They can communicate each other.
In this situation, I?d like to communicate with server through onion
So I installed Tor browser to onion proxy and onion routers I thought that Tor network would be generated, because private network that
I made has three onion routers and a onion proxy But, Onion Proxy?s tor browser wasn?t able to make Tor circuit.
I believe that directory server?s absence cause onion proxy not to produce
Tor circuit I am wondering if you have some tips for me to make my own directory server.
I really hope to listen your opinion.
Thank you for assigning your valuable time to read my question
