@_subject: Tor nodes question 
I've just started using Tor and would appreciate
any help with a few points I'm unsure about.
1. Is it possible to restrict entry/exit nodes by
geographical location of the node?
2. Is it possible to ensure that each node in the
circuit is located in a different country?  What
are the chances that all 3 nodes will be located
in the US, for example?  Is there any way to
tell if this has happened?
3. Is it possible to trace individual packets back
through the 3-node circuit?  If the exit node
knows which node sent the packet, and that node
(middle node) knows the entry node, and the entry
node knows your IP, then couldn't someone trace any packets leaving the exit node back to source?

@_subject: Tor nodes question 
I did read the Tor docs before posting here so I'm aware of your
suggestion, the problem I'm having is that I can't find a way to
restrict ALL entry and exit nodes in a particular country without having
to go through the list and exclude them individually, and then keep
scanning the list everyday to exclude any new nodes that are added.
Surely there must be a simpler way?   Can't I just set it up to exclude
all nodes from a particular country?

@_subject: Same entry and exit node? 
I notice that everytime I run Tor it opens connections to several nodes.
 I know this is normal, but recently I ran Tor and checked my IP - it
showed that my IP (i.e. the exit node) was the SAME IP as one of the
entry nodes I was connected to!
I cleared the browser cache beforehand so it can't be a cache problem.
Surely this can't be right, is it really possible that Tor can use the
same node for entry and exit?

@_subject: port 9030 
I've noticed that every time I run Tor, it opens connections to several
nodes (usually on port 443 or 9001).  However, it also connects to one
node on port 9030 (not always the same node, but there's always one
connection on port 9030) and it starts downloading something.  It lasts
for about 30 seconds, then it stops downloading and the connection to
port 9030 either drops, or sometimes changes to port 9001.
There are no messages in the Tor window to give any indication as to
what it's downloading.  Anyone know what's going on here?

@_subject: Tor and Putty 
I'm using a combination of Firefox>Privoxy>Putty>Tor>SSH
Server>Internet, in order to access web-pages securely which I otherwise
wouldn't be able to because they don't have SSL (like google).
The problem is that sometimes Putty is being bypassed completely and I
end up connecting to the destination URL from the Tor exit node.  Other
times I connect to the SSH server via Tor, and from there to the
destination URL, which is how it SHOULD work, but doesn't always.
I've tried shutting down Putty, starting it again, switching off my PC
and starting again.  It's completely hit-and-miss as to whether it works
or not.  Is anyone experiencing similar problems?

@_subject: randomness of Tor exit nodes 
I've been using Tor for a few weeks now and I've noticed that I don't
get much randomness in the exit nodes, I've only ever connected through
about 6 or 7 different ones.  I don't have any restrictions in place
(except for only using unverified nodes in the middle, which is the
default setting - everything else is default also).  As I understand it,
Tor should be picking a random node from a selection of over 200.  Am I doing something wrong?
