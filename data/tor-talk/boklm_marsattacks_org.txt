Unless tor was linked statically to openssl, using for instance the
--enable-static-openssl or --enable-static-tor configure options.
Checking that tor is not linked statically can be done with ldd:

I don't know what is the exact definition of "open Internet", but I'm
not sure we should oppose that to Tor hidden services. The Tor hidden
services are accessed using the internet, and they also look very open
to me: anybody can access them if they know the address, using free
software, based on a protocol that is documented.

@_subject: [tor-talk] "Hidden Services" vs "Onion services" 
I think most of the time, it doesn't really make sense to talk about all
the .onion sites as a whole, so I'm not sure that a term is needed to
describe that. There isn't really a network of all those sites, but many
unrelated sites that just happen to be using the same tool (the Tor network)
and have nothing else in common.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB visited links color 
Yes, this is related to private browsing mode. In default firefox too,
if you enable private browsing mode, the visited links don't change color.
According to this page:
"getComputedStyle (and similar functions like querySelector) will lie.
They will always return values as if a user has never visited a site."

@_author: Nicolas Vigier 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Problems? Verifying signatures in Tor 4.0.4 
The good one is the second one: giving the signature file as first
argument, and the file to be checked as second argument.
The problem with giving only one argument is that if the .asc file
contains some text with an in-line signature (rather than what people
would expected: a detached signature for the .tar.xz file), then gpg
will only verify this inline signature and ignore the .tar.xz file.
And the output only tells you that there is a good signature, so you
can't see that the .tar.xz file was not checked.
 $ echo 'some text' > some_file.txt
 $ gpg --clearsign some_file.txt
 $ mv some_file.txt.asc tor-browser-linux32-4.0.4_en-US.tar.xz.asc
Now the gpg command tells us the signature is good, although it has
nothing to do with tor-browser-linux32-4.0.4_en-US.tar.xz:
 $ gpg --verify tor-browser-linux32-4.0.4_en-US.tar.xz.asc  gpg: Signature made Fri 27 Feb 2015 02:09:25 PM CET
 gpg:                using RSA key 2067001B1B678A63
 gpg: Good signature from "Nicolas Vigier (boklm) "
 gpg:                 aka "Nicolas Vigier (boklm) "
But with 2 arguments it tells us something is wrong:
 $ gpg --verify tor-browser-linux32-4.0.4_en-US.tar.xz.asc tor-browser-linux32-4.0.4_en-US.tar.xz
 gpg: not a detached signature

@_subject: [tor-talk] Is it secure to use Tor with HTTP Proxies? 
It depends what you mean by "secure", but Tor Browser includes many
protections to avoid leaking private informations and make all browsers
look the same, which you will be missing if you use a standard browser
through Tor:
It's also unclear why you want to connect to an HTTP proxy through Tor
and what you are trying to solve by doing that. If your goal is to browse
websites anonymously, then using standard Tor Browser is probably what
you should do.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Bug in the initial release of Tor Browser 7.5.4 
Tor Browser is checking this file to see if it is out of date:
The issue with the 7.5.4 release was that the RecommendedTBBVersions
file was updated to add the new version a few minutes after the release
was published (instead of before), so if you updated in that interval,
your browser would say that it is out of date after being updated.
The issue has been fixed by updating the RecommendedTBBVersions file.
Uninstall and reinstall of the browser was not needed.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor browser 9.0.7 is broken 
Tor Browser 9.0.7 is now disabling javascript completely when selecting
the Safest security level, which also prevents using noscript to allow
some javascript to run:
The reason we did this change is that a bug in Firefox ESR might allow
bypassing Noscript. Although Noscript now includes some workarounds to
prevent that from happenning, but we don't know if that is enough.
If you want to allow javascript on a specific website, I think there
are two main options:
 - set javascript.enabled and use noscript configuration to allow
   javascript on some specific website, and accept the risk that some
   other website might be able to bypass noscript.
 - change the security level before visiting the website where you want
   javascript. But also remember that the security level applies to all
   open tabs, so you should not forget to change it back to Safest
   before visiting other websites.
