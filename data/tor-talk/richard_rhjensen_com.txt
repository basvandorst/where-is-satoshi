I'm new to tor and set up a Fedora Core box as a server on 0.1.0.16.
At that time, tor showed as a service when I ran serviceconf, but after
installing 0.1.0.17 last night, it does not appear. Is this expected?
I also saw a warning in my log file that I haven't seen before:
Feb 21 02:16:14.851 [warn] resolve_my_address(): Could not resolve local Address whitestone.homelinux.net. Failing.
But when I check the correct IP address appears for my server.
Do I need to be concerned?

And this morning, tor was not running.
It created a new log file at 4:02 am (as it has every other day),
but there was no message about opening a new log file. The new
log file was 0 bytes.
Should I go back to 0.1.0.16?

I downloaded the Red Hat rpm from Then (as root) I ran rpm -Uvh tor-0.1.0.17-tor.0.rh4_2.i386.rpm
This indicated a problem with libevent1.1 not being present (even though
the 0.1.0.16 install had been working) so I did a yum install libevent*
and then repeated the rpm upgrade.
This morning after noticing that tor was NOT running, I looked in the /etc/rc.d
entries and compared them to those on an FC4 box where I have the 0.1.0.16 version
still installed. I added symbolic links for:
  ./rc0.d/K10tor
  ./rc1.d/K10tor
  ./rc2.d/S90tor
  ./rc3.d/S90tor
  ./rc4.d/S90tor
  ./rc5.d/S90tor
  ./rc6.d/K10tor
to match those I saw on that system and now tor shows up in the serviceconf listing.

I'm logging to notices.log just to make sure tor keeps running.
This morning I noticed a few messages I don't recall seeing before
(I'm running 0.1.0.17 on a Fedora Core [FC4] box).

Should I be concerned about any of these?
