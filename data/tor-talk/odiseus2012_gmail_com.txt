@_subject: [tor-talk] A "paranoid" question 
How can I trust that the intermediate TOR computers are not really a
central network for tracking and processing the communications?
I see that the main sponsor is "An anonymous North American NGO" - New
Global Order? :D -  and, I don't know why but it reminds me what I heard
once that one of the main investors of Facebook is the CIA (one of their
thousand facades)...
