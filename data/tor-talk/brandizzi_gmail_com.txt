@_subject: [tor-talk] Maintaining your privacy sending e-mails 
Hello, all!
How do you manage to send e-mails? I'd like to send e-mails in an
anonymous way but most of the webmails make it very difficult. I bet
that it is not easy to do using my own SMTP and POP3 servers either.
Is that possible?
(My intentions are not illegal, so it would be ok to use a method
which would force me to present myself on a jugde :) )
Thanks in advance!
