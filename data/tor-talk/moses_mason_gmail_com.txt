@_subject: How to run a hidden service on Windows system while TOR is running as Windows service(daemon)? 
Hash: SHA1
Could anyone can tell me how to run a hidden service on Windows system
while tor is running as Windows service/daemon?
I've checked the manual page (
 ), all things is ok
except when I try to run tor as a Windows service. i.e. While running
tor under cmd prompt, "private_key" and "hostname" files are created
exactly as what manual told, under "hidden services" folder. But when
I try "tor --service start", no file was created at all.
Torrc file has been moved to "x:\Documents and
Settings\[myusername]\Application Data\" as documentation told for
running tor as windows service. My system is Windows XP SP2, and tor
version is 0.2.0.6-alpha (r11277).
Any ideas?

Thanks for reply. Sorry for my typo, I mean "x:\Documents and

Anyway, do I still need move torrc to administrator's path? I can't
find tor folder under administrator\application data\ . My user

I tried both:
got from tor:
Running on a Post-Win2K OS, so we'll assume that the LocalService
account exists.
IMPORTANT NOTE:
    The Tor service will run under the account "NT
AUTHORITY\LocalService".  This means
    that Tor will look for its configuration file under that
    account's Application Data directory, which is probably not
    the same as yours.
Done with CreateService.
Service installed successfully
Service started successfully
Same issue persists.
