@_subject: [tor-talk] Including Adblock to TBB to save bandwith 
Hello all,
Using less bandwidth per user won't necessarily make the network
"faster" for the individual user. There is already a surplus of
bandwidth available, as seen here:
FWIW, I use an adblocking plugin on my TBB because it is how I prefer
to view webpages. I'm aware of why it cannot be included by default,
as others have stated.

I'm abit concerned about not having a consensus of the dirauth's
knowing about the BadExit flag. Is this a problem? Only 4/9 know about
that flag right now and 3/9 are missing signatures. Can someone
explain this better? Thanks!
