@_subject: [tor-talk] Let's make Onion Addresses Meaningful To Humans 
Sounds like an interesting idea.  Another potential solution is Namecoin, which supports mapping memorable .bit addresses to .onion addresses.  In theory, the only way to seize/censor a .bit address is a 51% attack.  I believe there are already some .onion addresses using .bit addresses.

Not correct; Namecoin supports mapping names to Tor hidden services, as well as I2P and Freenet sites.  Obviously you need to use a Namecoin implementation that's a proxy instead of a DNS server, but that's not a big deal (nmcsocks already implements this).

this approach may be really interesting, I think it deserve an
I'm a developer of Namecoin.  We actually have DNS for .onion
addresses already working, although the implementation is pretty rough
and should only be considered a proof of concept.  Right now it's in
the form of a Firefox extension, but a XULRunner-based standalone
proxy application is close to release.  There's a little bit of info
at  , but we haven't done a great job of
documenting the .onion support yet... I can answer questions.
One potential issue is that Namecoin (and most Bitcoin-based
currencies) aren't anonymous due to blockchain graph analysis; the
best that can be obtained right now is pseudonymity.  This is still
useful, since it gives you location anonymity, so you can hide the
true location+IP of your .onion server and/or your Namecoin node.
We're interested in implementing the Zerocash proposal by
Miers/Garman/et.al. once its code is released, which would give much
better anonymity.
I'm not sure why the author of the proposal linked above thinks that
we need Tor relays to be trusted... the Namecoin developers are
actively looking at solutions such as SPV+UTXO, which has much better
trust properties than trusting a quorum of 3 random relays, and
doesn't use much storage or bandwidth.
Any questions, feel free to ask -- we're more than interested in
working with the Tor community to make DNS for .onion usable.

Hi coderman,
Any chance you could provide more details on what you're using?  Last

FreeSpeechMe and NMCSocks; FreeSpeechMe doesn't handle round-robin,

Namecoin would make this pretty easy.  Last I checked the current
Namecoin domain name spec only supports round-robin DNS for IPv4/IPv6
and not Tor/I2P, but there's consensus that that will be changed soon
to allow round-robin for Tor and I2P as well.  Note that to my
knowledge there aren't any implementations of that feature yet.
Namecoin would also give you human-readable names.

Hash: SHA256
By "identifier", you mean the .onion name?  If so, then yes, there are
a few ways this could be done.  One potential method is to have the
client look up names by prefix rather than exact match, so that if you
have xyz.onion, the client looks up all Namecoin names that *begin*
with xyz.onion, and the client will look through them until it finds
one whose value includes a signature signed by the .onion key.  An
attacker could try to spam the namespace with lots of names that have
invalid .onion signatures, but given name fees this would be a quite
expensive attack and would only slow down the lookup rather than stop
it from working.  This functionality (specific to .onion) is not
implemented at the moment, but fast prefix lookups are implemented in
namecoind in a dev branch (which will hopefully be merged to master
soon), so this isn't something that would be incredibly hard to do.
If there's specific interest in this kind of functionality, I can
inquire into whether we can merge the fast prefix lookups code now --
let me know if you'd like me to do so.

@_subject: [tor-talk] SOCKS proxy to sit between user and Tor? 
Hash: SHA256
I'm interested in having a SOCKS proxy sitting between the end user
and the Tor-provided SOCKS proxy, which can do really simple stuff
like redirect from one host to another.  (Just on the level of the
host requested via SOCKS, not HTTP headers.)  To implement this, I
figure surely there must be a decent SOCKS implementation I can use,
since I don't trust myself to implement the SOCKS protocol.
Unfortunately, GitHub appears to have numerous implementations of
questionable quality, and randomly searching GitHub isn't a great way
to find high-qualify code anyway.
So I'm wondering if there are any SOCKS proxy implementations that Tor
enthusiasts often use as an intermediary between a user and Tor, or
would consider suitable for such usage.  My basic requirements are:
* Reasonably well-reviewed implementation.
* Not abandoned, reasonably well maintained at least for bugfixes.
* Supports SOCKS auth in some way (I just want to pass-through the
auth to Tor for the purposes of stream isolation).
* Cross-platform (Linux/OSX/Windows).
* Generally something that Tor-interested people would expect to be
reasonably secure.
I'm not really picky about what language it's in, although a
high-level language is preferable over C/C++.  Python would be ideal,
all things being equal, but that's a very weak constraint and isn't a
big deal.
Extensibility would be a plus, i.e. if I can implement something like
redirects without modifying internal code, that would be a major benefit
Suggestions would be appreciated, if anyone has any.

I want to be able to modify the host that the user program is
requesting from the Tor SOCKS proxy.  E.g. Firefox requests abc.com,
Tor receives a request for xyz.org.  And I want to do this without
modifying Tor's source code.
The intended use case is redirecting .bit domains to .onion domains
(as a way of enabling human-readable .onion domains), without needing
any modifications to Tor or TorBrowser.  (Also redirecting .bit to
.b32.i2p domains would be an application.)
My understanding is that the main quirk of Tor's SOCKS implementation
is that the SOCKS basic auth is used for stream isolation, so passing
it through from the user to Tor shouldn't hurt anything.  Is there
some other deviation from the SOCKS spec that I don't know about?

Yep, as you noticed, I'm the developer of FreeSpeechMe.  (And thanks
for the mention -- happy to see that the project is being cited by
people such as yourself.)  FreeSpeechMe actually is a proxy, just
implemented in Javascript.  It's based on Convergence by Moxie
Marlinspike.  The original intention of using Convergence was that it
can validate self-signed TLS certs by using a non-malicious local
MITM.  However, that approach has high attack surface (as systems like
Superfish have demonstrated, although Convergence is much higher
quality implementation than Superfish and, as far as we know, hasn't
made any nasty mistakes).  Also, Mozilla seems to have wiped out the
API that Convergence was using to validate TLS (there might be ways
around this, I haven't thoroughly debugged).  Generally the
Convergence proxy was pretty hacked together and I don't like its
implementation.  It uses js-ctypes to call the NSPR and NSS libraries
that Firefox includes, and those libraries were never really intended
for extensions to access.  It's also unmaintained for quite a while,
and I got tired of fixing bugs in code that I had no familiarity with
and that used API's that I've never used (and, for that matter, almost
no one uses or documents).
We now have a new method of validating TLS (should be released soon)
that doesn't use a proxy and is much simpler.  However, this left us
in a position of having to find a new way to handle the DNS aspect of
Namecoin (both directing to IP addresses and .onion/.b32.i2p).  I do
have a proof of concept of a Namecoin DNS proxy using the mitmproxy
library (which we initially investigated as a TLS validation library,
but decided to avoid for that purpose because intercepting proxies
inherently have high attack surface).  The question is whether
mitmproxy is really the best way to do it, given that we originally
chose it for entirely different reasons than our current criteria are
(we don't care about TLS interception anymore, we just want a nice
well-maintained proxy).  mitmproxy is very well maintained, and fits
most of our requirements.  The mitmproxy developers have also been
very nice to us.  However, it's a fairly large library (due to the
interception capabilities that it has), and it's originally written
for pen-testing rather than end user usage.  Am I being overly
paranoid?  Maybe so -- indeed, we're calling a very small subset of
mitmproxy's functionality, and we explicitly disable all of the
protocol level processing that mitmproxy does; we configure it to
treat all connections as straight TCP traffic with no processing after
the SOCKS protocol has been processed.  So... it's conceivable that
mitmproxy is a good avenue, given our use case.  (It also helps that
mitmproxy is Python, and the code that we have for processing Namecoin
records is also Python, so that simplifies implementation
substantially.)  Do you think we should just use mitmproxy and spend
our limited engineering resources on other problems?
Yes, blockchains offer basically the best lookup privacy possible,
since lookups don't generate network traffic.
Yes.  Indeed, the Namecoin processing library that we're using
(NMControl) has pluggable backends.  The default backend is to load
from the Namecoin blockchain, but there's another backend that loads
from a user-provided file.  So you could create a file that lists
names for .onion, change one line in the config file so that the file
backend is used instead of the Namecoin blockchain, and you've got a
petname system that provides the same API as Namecoin (and would be
usable by whatever I end up doing here).
Well, a petname system isn't deterministic between users.  So if I
provide you with a link to some petname, you won't know which .onion
I'm intending you to visit.  I think I2P tries to mitigate this by
letting people subscribe to feeds of petnames (I admit I'm not that
familiar with the internals of I2P), but it's not as good a solution
as Namecoin (which is designed to solve exactly that problem, i.e. the
Zooko's Triangle problem of deterministic, decentralized, human
readable naming).
Quite honestly, I haven't reviewed the OnioNS design thoroughly, so
I'm not really able to comment on it yet.  From what I do know, OnioNS
makes a design assumption that a quorum of Tor relays are honest,
while Namecoin makes a design assumption that a quorum of Namecoin
miners are honest.  The analysis of whether these assumptions are
valid is complicated.  However, a system like OnioNS cannot work in a
decentralized network; it's completely dependent on the Tor directory
authorities to prevent Sybil attacks, while Namecoin has reasonable
resistance to Sybil attacks without relying on a trusted third party
(a while back I calculated the cost of enough ASIC mining hardware to
overwhelm Namecoin, and it was nearly a billion USD).  Does that
matter in terms of applicability to Tor?  Not really; I don't think
Tor is going to become decentralized any time soon, nor does it need
to in order to continue doing well.  This argument is somewhat more
relevant to I2P, which doesn't have directory authorities, but that's
out of scope of your question.  In terms of the actual design of
OnioNS, I can't speak to it because I haven't reviewed it... so I
guess I can't really fully answer your question there.  But it's a
good question.
(Wow, this email is long... hope I covered everything.)

make tracking less effective without resorting to a blacklist [1], so

Also, since Tom spammed a link to BitMail, it's worth noting that

about Namecoin's security being weak that the Namecoin developers (and
most other Bitcoin-related people I've talked to) considered to be
inaccurate (I won't elaborate on the allegations in this message, as I
don't want to contribute to the "lack of on-topic discussion"
problem).  My initial response, which was shared by most of the other
Namecoin and Bitcoin people I know, was to laugh about it on IRC, and
ignore it, figuring that since the allegations were obviously
inaccurate, there wasn't any need to get drawn into drama.
What we hadn't counted on, yet should have, is that even very smart
people are not experts in everything, and it's difficult to discern
what's accurate and what's not when one isn't an expert.  I realized
this when I was talking to someone in a related field, though not an
expert in Bitcoin, and he seriously asked me about the allegations

we didn't think the allegations were accurate.  Yes, it would have
taken up some of our development time.  But it probably would have
saved more time later, which we ended up spending on explaining things
