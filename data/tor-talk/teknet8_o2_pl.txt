@_subject: Chunked must be last Transfer-Encoding problem 
I installed new Tor and privoxy.
Web browsers work fine with it.
My problem is when i try to communicate thru my script with proxy:
my $proxy = "
my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new();	/* same class as LWP:UserAgent */
my $urlsearch = "
print $mech->content;
I receive:
500 Chunked must be last Transfer-Encoding 'identity'
When i change in privoxy to point not to Tor but other http proxy everything works fine.
When i change $proxy variable to connect directly to other HTTP proxy everything works fine.
With this code some web pages works fine (like  but others (like  returns
this error. With other proxies all pages works fine.
Where could be the problem ? What does Tor changes when forwarding HTTP packets ?
How could i make my script is working correctly with all pages with Tor ? (like with other proxy servers) ?
