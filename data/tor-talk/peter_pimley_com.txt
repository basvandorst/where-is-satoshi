@_subject: [OT]RE: Unsubscribe 
The thing is, sending a message like the one we saw does, practically always, achieve the desired result.  Sometimes it leaves remaining subscribers discussing mailing list software and the like, but the main thing (from the unsubscriber's point of view) is that it does work.
If it doesn't work you just send another one.  Pretty soon you find yourself unsubscribed ;)
To unsubscribe, send an e-mail to majordomo at torproject.org with
unsubscribe or-talk    in the body.
