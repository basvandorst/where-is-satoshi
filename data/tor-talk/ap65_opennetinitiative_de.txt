There already is torque, a naming daemon which allows you to  map .onion addresses to keys which are more easily to remember (e.g.  6sxoyfb3h2nvok2d.onion  becomes hiddenwiki.tor) It can be checked out  from  but I'd like to  refrain from commenting on possible security issues for now.

Unfortunately you haven't. According to the JAP (the anonymizer in  question) FAQ [1], JAP servers can be set up to "tag" and log  connections from certain source/destination-combinations, when  prosecution authorities request it, but apparently resolving past  connections ex-post is impossible. This seems to be some trade-off in  order to comply with German legislation and not render the program  illegal. Which brings up the question of the legal status of Tor  servers in Germany. What would happen to a server operator forced by  law to log individual future connections, but unable to do so, since  Tor doesn't allow it?

I'm quite confident that the package was supposed to create a user  for tor to run under. As a quick fix, here are some pointers for  creating a _tor user manually.
In MacOS X new users can be added with the "Netinfo Manager",  residing in /Applications/Utilities/. Here's how:
* Open Netinfo Manager
* click on the lock and enter your admin password
* browse to the folder "users" and hit "New"
*name the newly created folder "_tor"
*select the folder and hit "New" to create the following key-value  passwd				*
_writers_tim_passwd	_tor	
uid					100			(or any unused uid?)
home				/Library/Tor/var/lib/tor
shell				/dev/null
gid					1			(or any unused gid?)
realname			Tor User
_writers_passwd		_tor
* Hit Apple+S to commit the changes
At least my _tor user is set up that way. I hope I didn't get  anything wrong and it helps to solve your problem

You could get an dyndns account (static hostname assigned to a  changing ip) and set the Address option in your torrc to that hostname.

Some routers e.g. v.1.0 of the WRT54G or the Asus WL500g Premium have  mini-PCI slots (fitted with wifi-cards, of course), others have  broadcom CPUs with built in crypto-acceleration, so this should be  doable with of the shelf hardware as well. Tor has already been  ported to OpenWRT to (v. 0.9.1 though) [1], but I never tried it and  can't really tell wether it's usable.

There is already a corresponding wiki page:
Strato is not yet listed, but it would be nice to have some reports  about it, since it is one of the larger budget-hosting providers in  best wishes
