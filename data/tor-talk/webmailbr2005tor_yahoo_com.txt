@_subject: [tor-talk] Basic Orbot question 
In my Android phone, the option "Start Orbot on Boot" is set to off, but Orbot is always listed in "Settings" > "Applications" > "Manage Applications" > "Running", every time i turn my phone on. What's the reason for that? I don't want Orbot to run without my permission. I'm running Orbot 0.2.3.10-alpha-1.0.7-FINAL on a rooted Motorola MB525 Defy with stock Froyo. Thanks!
