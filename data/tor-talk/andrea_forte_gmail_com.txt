@_subject: [tor-talk] Interview Study on Anonymity and Peer Production 
Hi all,
I'm representing a team of researchers from Drexel University who are
researching how Tor users contribute to online projects (like Wikipedia,
open source, discussion forums etc). If you have used Tor (or tried or
wanted to use it) while making contributions to such projects, we?d like to
learn from your experiences.
The study is titled ?Privacy, Anonymity, and Peer Production.?  We are also
some the people responsible for the project described in this post:
If you would like to help us out, you need to read and complete the online
consent form linked here and we will get in contact with you:
We are planning to conduct interviews that will last anywhere from 30-90
minutes (depending on how much you have to say) by phone or Skype and we
can offer you $20 for your time, but you do not need to accept payment to
Thanks for considering it, please contact me if you have questions.

thanks for the heads up, didn't think to test the survey service provider.
I've created a simple form that should work for just about everyone. Just
as a note, we are not saving any identifying data like email with data from
interviews and we are not asking about activities that generally cause
people concern.  We only need an email address to be able to contact people.
If anyone is interested in supporting our research on privacy and peer
production projects, a better version of the consent form can now be found
Hi Andrea, Rachel, & Nazanin
The sign-up process requires javascript, which will most likely limit
your potential sign-ups, as many of us use TBB with js disabled.
Food for thought.
