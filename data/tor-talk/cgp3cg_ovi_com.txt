@_subject: How to create firefox profiles in linux tor bundle? 
1. Find the profile directory.  Should be:
     /path/to/tbb/Data/profile
2. Make a copy of the entire profile:
     /path/to/tbb/Data/p2
3. Start Firefox from the command line:
     /path/to/tbb/App/Firefox/firefox -profile /path/to/tbb/Data/p2
If you start Firefox with the -ProfileManager option it will try to load the profiles from the ~/.mozilla directory, which isn't what you want. I'm not sure if you can force Firefox to change the default config directory from the command line.
