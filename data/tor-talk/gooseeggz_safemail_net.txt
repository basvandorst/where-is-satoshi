@_subject: [tor-talk] Tails question: Desktop in laptop mode during shutdown, 
Why is my desktop being shown as in laptop mode when I shutdown? There's also some myserious
"SENSE" or "sense" data shown, much like would be shown within a binary. The shutdown screen
quits after wiping so I don't have a chance to catch the information to write it down unless
I take a photograph of the screen with a camera. What is this info and why is my desktop
being put into laptop mode? The SENSE data is always the same, a few lines which appear like
hex data from a binary.
I'm posting here because this was not solved/addressed on the Tails forums.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tails question: Cannot rename old configuration file 
When the network is up and Vidalia/tor/browser all opens, I peek inside the tor log (/var/log/tor) and this error is included:
[notice] Renaming old configuration file to "/etc/tor/torrc.orig.1" [warn] Couldn't rename configuration file "/etc/tor/torrc" to "/etc/tor/torrc.orig.1": Permission denied
torrc is owned by root:root
I've tried a number of changes in ownership but nothing will allow the changes to be written for the torrc file, has it always been broken like this?
How to fix?

@_subject: [tor-talk] GWeather - giving away location data? How to disable? 
When I set the location in the clock/location settings, I notice the following errors in .xsession-errors:
(gnome-panel: GWeather-WARNING **: Failed to get METAR data: 504 Connect to weather.noaa.gov:80 failed: Connection refused.
When I try to remove GWeather from the system, it throws up several important dependencies so I cancel the removal.
When I rename the libgweather.so* files to something else it breaks the libclock-applet.
I don't want my system trying to fetch weather information, especially not from a ** GOVernment site! **
Because of this stupid GWeather bug, this remains open until I shutdown:
127.0.0.1:8118 CLOSE_WAIT The failures above eventually vanish when I check my location at a later date, when clicking the clock applet, it shows the weather for my area which I specified after boot!
If I unselect showing the
weather it grabs it anyway! And how often does it update the weather? Only when I click on it
or at various timed or random intervals? I'm not using the regular weather applet which must
be manually added to the panel, this is under the clock applet/location area.
How may I safely disable GWeather without killing the clock applet? I need to enter my location
when running from a LiveCD (such as Tails, I asked on their message board but no one responded)
so the time is up to date, enough for Tor to work. Otherwise if I don't enter the correct location
Tor views my system time as invalid and halts with errors.
I believe this is a heavy erosion privacy.
