@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor + obfsproxy on Centos 6 
Has anyone succeeded in getting this combination to run on a RedHat distro?
Both Tor and obfsproxy compile and run (i think):
[obfs at gryphon obfsproxy]$ obfsproxy obfs2 --dest=127.0.0.1:9001 server
0.0.0.0:1051 &[1] 3228
[obfs at gryphon obfsproxy]$ cat /etc/torrc SocksPort 0
ORPort 9001BridgeRelay 1
Exitpolicy reject *:*ServerTransportPlugin obfs2 exec
# Log debug file /var/log/tor/log
[obfs at gryphon obfsproxy]$ tor -f /etc/torrc &[2]
