It all started 4 days ago, when PinkMeth site posted a profile with the self-taken nudes of the daughter of the company owners.
The company, Markosky Engineering of Ligonier, PA and has since shut down their website, and will likely eventually be forced out of business. Their customer list includes Georgia Institute of Technology, Greensburg Diocese, local municipalities, airport and transportation authorities, among others. Their customers and employees are now bombarded with the links to this profile. Customers aren't likely to continue business with the company whose name has been tarnished this way, and linked to .
This is a story how powerful can tor make an otherwise vulnerable to legal repercussions website.

PinkMeth case only points out the underlying problem in society, which doesn't accept certain types of behavior. The service itself, just like the internet in general, only allows information to be freely distributed. And people make their own conclusions based on it. If these conclusions end up being not very likable, this isn't the fault of the particular service.

I really don't understand why you are particularly so upset with PinkMeth. People's information is being exploited all over, with and without tor. What about facebook, or gmail, or yahoo selling your information to advertisers? There can be very intimate info, textual or graphical, there. I am sure advertisers routinely get dumps with nudes included as parts of the customer profiles by well known companies under NDA. How is this better than PinkMeth? Is it because this is done in secret, and isn't obvious?
It is the nature of information that it changes domain once leaked, and this can't be reverted. The information originator should care about its protection. Maybe this is the problem of user literacy, but pictures taken with the modern cell phones aren't private. They usually are immediately uploaded to the cloud, where they are stored unencrypted, left to sysadmins to be watched over. These companies don't care about your privacy much, otherwise they would have encrypted them. These women also send them to multiple random parties, this also makes them not private. What is private anyway?
Once leaked, they would end up on hundreds of sites, and they can't be removed from everywhere. PinkMeth is only one of them.
User stupidity is also a major part of this. Stupidity just isn't compatible with privacy much.

I am not saying that PinkMeth is squeaky clean. It is a controversial service. However, it isn't any worse compared to other egregious privacy violations that occur daily on the massive scale, and you seem to hold a particular dislike of PinkMeth.
It was even the court decision that e-mail contents fall under "expectation of privacy", however government doesn't give a rat's a** about this and massively reads people's e-mails. So why would you expect an operator of the hidden service to respect such things? They might even be located in another jurisdiction, where there is no "expectation of privacy" concept. Additionally, society has controversial views about what is "normal" and what is not. Otherwise we wouldn't even hold this conversation.
Too bad, nobody is out there to guard their privacy rights. This is just the fact. Rights are only as strong as the means of their protection.

If you seriously think that US government is like Gestapo, I suggest you should travel more around the world and see what is going on in other countries. Look how in Russia prominent politicians and opposition leaders get murdered with regularity. Look how many opposition leaders did Belarus president murder on his way up (it is well over 2 dozens). Look what they do in Middle Eastern countries with people who criticize their religious fairy tails. In Saudi Arabia they will just drag you out to the street and chop your head off in front of horrified passers by. And they do this like every day.
Some pretty bad things are going on in US, but it is not nearly as bad as what you see in over 80% of other countries. At least there are laws, courts, human rights, constitutional protections. You have the right for attorneys, due process, nobody will jail you for criticizing anything or saying anything at all short of threats.
With respect,

Maybe it is time for the Tor project to stop promoting the obviously insecure TBB, and embrace something that is known to be more secure, like Whonix?
