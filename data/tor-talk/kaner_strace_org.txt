Can you enable logging for Tor and check if you see some errors? Or
see anything at all?

Can you restart Tor and see if that puts any messages in your logfile?
If not, you seem to have changed some configuration settings in the
meantime, breaking it.

That is why I asked him to *restart* Tor and see if there are any new
messages in there.

The way you use, you restart it by:
~> killall tor
~> tor -f /etc/tor/torrc

I guess your Tor is ok. Please follow the instructions provided by others.
Next time you want to kill Tor, check out its process id (`pidof tor`
or `ps ax | grep tor | grep -v grep`) and kill that explicitly via
`kill `. Make sure you're the same user that started Tor when you
kill it. Check if its still running afterwards (`ps ax | grep tor |
grep -v grep`).

Hi Scott,
Not meaning to sound like a professor here, but the default kill
signal is SIGTERM on systems I have used. YMMV.

Hi Jason,
I am taking this from tor-ops to or-talk since it's the more
appropriate mailing list for usage problems. Please make sure to add

My guess from what your symptoms are is that your Java/JavaScript
setting are somewhat screwed up due to Tor. Maybe you can elaborate a
bit more about what error messages you get etc. so we can make a
better guess what the problem might be.
In Firefox 2, the settings for Java/JavaScript can be changed as follows:
This might have changed in Firefox 3, maybe someone else can step up
and tell us how to change those in FF3?
p.s.: Jason's original mail is here:
"I may had followed your uninstalling process, but the real problem
is, your TOR had caused my connection to go haywire and certain
websites are causing their Javas to unable to read properly AND
webpages cannot be loaded completely. Even after uninstalling, the
connection still goes haywire and I'm unable to fix it as though like
reformatting may be the last answer to go for. Here are the following
websites which TOR causes it to haywire :
1. Deviantart
2. Hotmail
3. Nickelodeon (Official US site)"

@_subject: Encrypt for browsing 
You might want to take a look at: Also, HTTPS doesn't primarily take care of your anonymity. That's
Tor's job. HTTPS simply adds a layer of encryption to your traffic so
no one (for instance, the exit node administrator or ISP) can sniff
your traffic. Depending on the traffic that goes back and forth
between the Tor exit node you're using and the website you're visiting
HTTPS also protects your anonymity. For instance, if you surf your
Facebook profile via Tor, it would be fairly easy to look at the
traffic and sniff your name for the exit node admin or the ISP:
[you] -> [tor entry node] -> [tor middle node] -> [tor exit node] ->
The last hop between [tor exit node] and [facebook.com] would be
completely unencrypted and sniffable. You might want to avoid that.
Note that not all websites support HTTPS. Again, you might want to

@_subject: Verifying signatures 
Disclaimer: I'm not familiar with the MacOSX operating system very
much, but this could be a start:
First of all, you need to install GnuPG of some sorts on your
Computer. Try this:
If you got that downloaded and installed, you need to fire up a
command shell. Thats a little window into which you can type commands.
Try this address for help:
In that command shell you should be able to execute the "gpg" command
after a successfull install. Try this:
gpg --version
It should give you an output similar to:
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.10
Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
If this was successfull, GnuPG is actually installed on your computer,
yay! Now you will need to import the keys like so on the command
gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 0x28988BF5
This command will look for the key with the id "0x28988BF5" on server
"subkeys.pgp.net" and download it for you.
After that step is done, locate your package and .asc file, and verify
the package on the command shell:
gpg --verify PACKAGENAME.asc PACKAGENAME
Where PACKAGENAME should be the name of the package you downloaded.
Hope this helps,

Please try to get GnuPG running on your system. We can't really help
you to do that. You will need to understand what a command line
program is and how you use it.  To accomplish this, maybe read and
follow this tutorial here:
Feel free to come back when you managed to install and run GnuPG.

Maybe we don't update the Changelog of the .deb package in the way the
Ubuntu update manager expects it. Not a big problem I guess. As long
as you see no complaints about the key that the package is signed
with, you don't need to worry. :-)

@_subject: DNS issue: Tor works great but VPNs do not - why? 
For more information about DNS and Tor, see [0] and [1]. But are you
really sure its a DNS issue? Without further information I'd say that
one obvious answer would be that your University firewall simply
blocks the VPN ports (UDP 1194 for instance), but allows https-like
traffic on port 443.

@_subject: Me <-> Tor <-> VPN <-> Internet? 
There are VPN providers that will let you pay anonymously.
However, if you're taking anonymity on the Internet seriously, using a
VPN as the last and only line of defense carries all kinds of risks:
Traffic analysis ("Let's look at all traffic going in and out of this
VPN server and match the traffic"), single point of failure in form of
the VPN provider (Do you trust him not to keep logs and sell them to
the next highest bidder?) and some more. From an academic point of
view, there isn't much anonymity to gain from a VPN.
You could run Tor on top of the VPN to gain anonymity. That sounds
technically possible even though I haven't tried it -- but I don't see
much benefit here unless you're living in a country that blocks the
public Tor nodes and most bridges.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Weather reports Node Out of Date! 
just to close this issue for now:
After talking to Sebastian about possible alternate, less confusing
designs, we came up with the following:
Just one checkbox "[ ] email me when me node is out of date" -- sends
email to a user if their Tor version is not part of the "recommended"
versions. We do not send email if the user is running a more recent
dev version than the ones in "recommended". Also we don't send email
if the "recommended" list is empty.
The coding is done[0] and rolled out.
