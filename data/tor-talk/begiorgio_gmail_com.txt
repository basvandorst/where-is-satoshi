I've set up the proxy in firefox in order to connect to tor, and it
works well, now I would like to do this:
my_pc -> tor -> proxy_choosen_by_me:port->www_page
but if I type in the address bar of firefox:
I get nothing....
Can you help me?

First of all, thanks for your polite and fast answer.
To simplify the problem, I say that I would like to do this:
perl_script-> tor -> standard_http_proxy -> web_site
I want the web site to see the ip of the standard_http_proxy, not the tor ip.
Do you think that it is possible to do this?
Thanks in advance.

Why a proxy shouldn't accept connections coming from tor? To prevent abuses?
Can you tell me how to do this proxychaining?
I just read the faq again, where I found that perhaps you are worried
that I will use tor to connect to open relays on port 25 and then
spam, is it right? I can assure you that this is not the case (I would
not be using tor in this case, I think that there are much easier
tools), one of the reasons is for example that I don't want the
websites to know that I'm using tor.
Thanks in advance.

Hi Jonathan, I'm sorry if I was not clear; I don't own a proxy, I
would like to connect to an existing proxy using tor (I want the web
site to see the proxy ip, not the tor ip), for example the proxy lists
that I find here I will try to follow the ideas expressed by John and the I will let you know.
