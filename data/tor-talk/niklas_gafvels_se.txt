@_subject: [tor-talk] Exit relay, compile 0.2.4.19 on ARM v5 
I'm running an exit relay with an old version of tor. Compiling version
0.2.4.19 results in errors during the make (configure ok).
I have compiled and installed the latest versions of openssl(1.0.1e) and
libevent(2.0.13) . In configure of tor I used --enable-static-openssl
--with-openssl-dir= --enable-static-libevent
--with-libevent-dir=. But the make of tor gives me errors
(ARM related). Is there a command that enables support for ARM v5?
Part of the make result:

@_subject: [tor-talk] Current ipkg version for NAS 
I got a message from Tor Weather about "Node Out of Date".
I?m running a tor relay on a Qnap 419II (armv5tel machine).
The packages I can find on sites like
? are
Anybody knowing about a later version for NAS with arm as an ipk?

I'm trying to build Tor 0.2.3.25. But ./configure gives me an error about a signed size_t. What can be the reason, old compiler etc?
