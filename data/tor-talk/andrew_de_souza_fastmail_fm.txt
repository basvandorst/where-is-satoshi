@_subject: Washington DC Exit Node? 
Are there any working exit nodes with an IP address in Washington DC?  I
have looked at  and found no DC exit nodes
(there is one Washington State).  However, rather than manually checking
every single exit node from USA on ip2location.com can some one please
tell me if they know of a DC exit node
Thanks.
