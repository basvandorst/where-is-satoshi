@_subject: Proposal: Tor User Agent Carousel (TUAC) 
Why give the user any "options" on what UA to send? It makes Tor users
easier to track than if they all just looked the same (particularly
for high traffic sites). Remember that those that want to track can
get the list of exit-nodes with minimal effort.
What's needed in my opinion is an appropriate standard for all to
follow, with no "randomness" or options.
The JAP/Jondos project has such a standard for their users, see:
Something like that seems like a better idea to me. Torbutton seems
closest to such a standard currently.
Of course, not everyone uses Firefox, so there should be instructions
and easy to use tools for making other browsers (IE, Opera, Lynx ..)
look as similar as possible.
Sure, make such a feature, but personally I hope users will avoid
it. It seems to make matters worse, not better..
I think that you are concerned about an important subject, but

@_subject: Can I run a relay when I can't port forward? 
You could, but just the same as on your own network, they too could
block this if they wanted to.
You need their consent to do this. When they get abuse complaints the
evidence points in your direction.
A free proxy for your exit node? Dream on .. ;-)
"Open proxies" are zombified home computers, poorly configured caches
or honeypots for the most part. Slow, abusive and illegal to use.
There are or have been Tor nodes run from behind commercial proxies
though. Probably not many of them will allow you to run an exit node
because of the abuse, and not all will allow middle man either because
of the bandwidth requirements.
Yes, or OpenVPN, PPTP or a number of other protocols.
Good luck and thanks for wanting to help out.
