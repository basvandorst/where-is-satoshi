@_subject: [tor-talk] Run the shell script 
I've downloaded and extracted the tor bundle for linux but I can't run/execute the shell script (start-tor-browser) because when I click on it it opens by the text editor (gedit)! I've tried going to setting then Edit->Preferences->Behavior-> Executable text files but it's already "Ask each time" and it still open the script by the gedit without asking me anything!
Can you please help.
I am using Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS 64-bit
Thanks in advanced!
Omar

Thanks much Seth for your effort and help but sadly I got the error "Permission denied". I've googled and found "chmod +x start-tor-browser" but didn't worked, I think I've to chmod all the folder not just "start-tor-browser" file.
