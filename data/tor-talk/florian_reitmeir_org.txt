What do you expect? Is this a statement or a call for help? If you want help it would be helpful to add some system data:
- debian version (woody/sarge/etch/sid...)
- architecture, kernel version
- tor version
- tor node name?
- and maybe a description what the term "tor crashes" means, is it a memory
  leak? freezes the whole system? do you have some nice logs? whats in
  /var/log/tor/log after the crash?

if its a ECN problem, than look at
man iptables
-> TCPMSS
it solves your connection problem, but performance is bad. IMHO some Netgear
routers are really bad broken and are the cause for this sort of problem.

peter is right, TCPMSS will not fix the problem for you, i've been confused
by the PMTU issues Netgear routers also have.. i suggest you simple by a new router, for example an linksys wrt54gl, or ..
try an firmware upgrade..

Why do you want such a thin? i believe to prevent "attacks"?
- if the rules are correct, they allow "attacks" too
- the rules add complexity and make it hard to debug
- Tor is an open source software which isn't broken by design, so if there

- you have to run old buggy software because the vendor...
- you have to run unknown user installed software (like PHP..) and you are an

holes, or even completely new attacks possible.

maybe it will help getting some more light on the issue if you just install a
cronjob which prints the output of "date" in a file, and then try to see
if the issue is a tor bug or a kernel bug. 4300 secounds are a bit more than
60minutes.. so if its a kernel bug it should happen to other processes too.

to your question:
"internet"/"network" is build in layers
"the internet" begins at layer 3. Tor provides services for layer 3 and

MAC address of the wifi or build in ethernet card. (Layer 2)
But if Tor is used correctly he is not able to "see" what services "of the internet" you are using.
