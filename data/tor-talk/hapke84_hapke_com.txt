@_subject: Connection Problems to Authority Servers? 
since few days (about since 2010-01-20) I often get socket timeouts while connecting to the directory TCP-port of the directory authority servers (seen while connecting to tiger, ides, moria2, tor26). Is it a general problem or am I the only man who has seen such problems?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Will TOR interfere with anything on my dell laptop 
One possibility is the use of the silvertunnel.org Browser: a simple web browser with Tor implementation in Java. This software is started with one click on page
   (based on Java Web Start technology, i.e. Java must be installed on your computer) and runs independently of all other programs on your system.

@_subject: [tor-talk] WebbasedOS hidden service 
in my opinion it's a very good idea (even if this response comes with several weeks delay) - but I'm not sure whether the available software will do the job. I try to explain my concerns:
 > People should be able to create encrypted containers
 > ...
 > It's of course of major importance that users should
 > not be able to see activity of others, nor that I as
 > administrator could see that
... These requirements seam to be very important but they would imply that the apps (office, email and chat) are running completely in the users browser and do all the work, inclusive data encryption/decryption, and the server only provides the apps code and stores the encrypted data I.e. we actually talk about apps that are completely different than normal web apps. Instead, such apps work similar to classic rich client apps, only the app code and the data are provided by the server via http. To let such apps run in a browser, the apps must be probably run on JavaScript, Flash or Java Applets/Java Web Start. And the apps must encrypt/decrypt all data exchanged with the server. Do such (open source) apps for office, email and chat already exist? Or are there projects out there that work on such apps?
Best regards

If you want to embed Tor into a Java app you could use a pure Java lib:
