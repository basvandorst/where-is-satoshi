@_subject: [tor-talk] Recommended setting for NoScript's Javascript? 
I have solved many problems with javascript based websites by disabling the
"apply these settings to whitelisted sites" and "cascade permissions to
whitelisted sub-sites". That has worked for me in all situations

@_subject: [tor-talk] Which webmail providers are Tor friendly. 
I use Protonmail and that has been no problem at any point with Tor or
anything else. I'm not even sure if you need to enter any information more
than name to register.
But do check for yourselves. It has been a while since I registered

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why so may exit node IP addresses in the TBB? 
I assume that it is so that data entered on an assumed http website cannot
be used to identify your data to other sites. Simply, to decouple the
sifferent sessions you're having on different sites.

There is always a risk of bugs and exploits in the code. Having a security
researcher study these gives us better knowledge of the current flaws and
how to correct them. If you truly trust the browsers current security this
should have no downside, otherwise it is the path to improving it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] 0.3.0.6 on fedora 24: systemd? 
My spontaneous thought is to check the configure script (I'm not really
into the source but I'm guessing it's a script) to see what the tests are.
It is not improbable that the tests assume a certain configuration and look
for files that aren't necessarily present when you have systemd installed.
Hopefully someone with actual knowledge can tell you more.
