@_subject: [tor-talk] disabling onion page 
I want to disable my onion page without disconnecting from tor.
I add comment in tor 0.3.1.9

 80 127.0.0.1:80
and send
SIGNAL RELOAD
After that my hidden service is turn off.
In tor 0.3.2.10 it doesn't work.
Please help.

You have all of information.
Probably teor is too lazy to check disabling hidden service in his tor.
So try disabling hidden service without disconnecting tor in version
0.3.1.9 and 0.3.2.10.
Disabling works in 0.3.1.9 but doesn't work in 0.3.2.10.
