Its possible that a client picks two servers that don't currently have a
connection or have a connection with no other traffic between them to form a
hop. This results in complete lossage as only one client is sending data
through the connection, eliminating the security of that hop against timing
attacks. Do I have this wrong or is this a real issue?

This would 2/3 the load on servers when doing a negotiation(3
exponentations vs. 2 exponentiations). since most routes are
reletivly-short lived this would reduce load by a significant amount. All results against it require leakage of the random nonces used.

@_subject: Better Authentication/Key Negotiations 
One of the things I noticed about the TOR protocol is the amount of CPU a key negotiation takes. It takes 3 exponentiations by the server to decrypt the DH handshake, create the other part of the handshake, and preform the DH exponentiation. As this needs to be preformed three times to make a circuit, and each circuit only conducts a small amount of information when web browsing, and the servers have load issues, it looks like this is something we should simplify.
My idea is to sign the DH handshake half that the server sends to the client with something like a Schnorr signature, which is cheap to make. The client will still have to preform 3 exponentiations, but the server only 2. We could also use XTR to make the calculations cheaper without adopting Schnorr signatures, which are patented.

First some background:
The NSA's Suit B uses a key negotiation mutual authentication method MQV.
This method was found to be insecure, and so HMQV was created. HMQV uses a
signature protocol called HCR twice in one exchange to generate a key. HCR
can prove identy of one endpoint and negotiate a key in a two message
exchange with great efficiency for both sides.
In Tor the current key generation method is quite expensive. Would it be
possible to change to HCR to improve efficency?

How does the exit node know what circuit the packets belong to?  Different source ports in outgoing UDP packets?

@_subject: Removing 1 modular exponentiation 
Tor currently uses RSA encrypted DH exchanges. This requires that the
server and client both make 3 exponentiations: Two for DH, One for RSA.
But we can reduce this significantly. I've already presented this
before, but now I think I can justify security. Sanity checks are assumed.
Cryptographic Personae: Anonymous Alice and Ricky the Onion Router.
Protocol Paramaters: A group with a "generator" g that takes on m
values. DDH is hard in the group. I put generator in quotes because a
lot of the time it's not a mathematical generator. The group is written
Setup: Ricky picks a random positive integer k less then m. Let y be
Ricky's public key. Then y=g^k.
Protocol round 1: Alice picks a random positive integer a. Let f=y^a.
Alice sends f to Ricky.
Protocol round 2: Ricky picks a random positive integer b. Let h=g^b.
Key calculation: Ricky computes the key as f^(b/k) where
(g^(k))^(1/k)=g. Alice computes the key as h^a. Note that both Ricky and
Alice perform 2 group exponentiations.
Security justification: The goal of this protocol is to authenticate
Ricky to Alice. We have 2 values that can be modified by an attacker: f
and h. If the attacker modifies f, Ricky will compute a different key
then Alice. Likewise, if the attacker modifies h then Alice will compute
 a different key then Ricky. His one option remaining is to make equal
changes to both. But if Ricky and Alice reject bad values, then it is
the same as if Alice and Ricky had picked different nonces, and the
attacker still needs to solve the same problem. If k is reveled, then
the attacker needs to break a Diffie-Hellman exchange, so forwards
secrecy is preserved. We can also reduce DDH to this problem by letting
k equal 1.
I'll keep on working on this, and comments are welcome.

We already distribute different keys for the current protocol. But the
one I proposed is insecure so we might as well forget about it. Schnorr
signatures are secure and are intended for this purpose, but we can only
use them after 2008.

But f^(b/k) requires 1 exponentiation and 1 multiplication. So this does
save some work. The issue is that it is insecure.

Mike Perry had an MITM attack. It wasn't due to a problem with my proof
but a problem in that what I proved wasn't sufficient to insure
security. Basically Alice was performing DH with y the generator. So Eve
could easily perform an MITM attack. And Eve can connect to Ricky
easily. Still, a more efficient and still *secure* protocol would be a win.

@_date: 2007-02-19 23:28:46
@_author: Watson Ladd 
@_subject: Removing 1 modular exponentiation 
Yes. But what makes your attack work is that Alice can't tell the
difference between a DH negotiation with generator y and a normal
protocol round. So Eve can perform a MITM attack by fooling Alice and
connecting to Ricky normally. I should have realized this would be an
issue, esp. as it was cited as such in the paper on MQV. If we could
modify MQV for our purposes it would be nice. Making Alice generate a
temporary MQV key would work *I think*. Someone with more
experience/time then me should look into it. Unfortunately, MQV is patented.

The key to designing this with minimal changes to Tor is to separate
concerns. Tor can handle anonymous downloads. The issue now becomes
anonymous search. We could have dedicated index nodes, or we could make
a DHT(distributed hash table). DHT is probably the better approach. So
now the problem is making a DHT on top of tor. There has been some work
in this direction before, but I don't know what happened to it.

Nice. Patents are going to be an issue for this one and we will

I don't think that's the problem. If we made one thread per TLS

Prompted by the Ars Technica reporting on QUANTUM, I took a look at the
slide and read the text, as well as compared to the MULLINIZE document
describing NAT breaking. My conclusion is that the NSA obtains significant
amounts of information from user activity in between closing browsers, and
that current Tor Browser Bundle remains vulnerable to this attack.
QUANTUM appears to rely on inserting fake references to third party assets
and manipulating cookies in the requests made by the browser in response. I
propose that we block third party cookies unless over HTTPS to mitigate
this problem, and try to encourage users to use more frequent new
MULLINIZE achieves the reliable tracking of individual users behind a NAT
through similar tricks. It is clear that the NSA views this information as
valuable, even without real-world addresses to tie to it. Linkability
across pages is difficult: breaking sessions is a major cost of the obvious
no cookies approach to preventing this sort of attack.
