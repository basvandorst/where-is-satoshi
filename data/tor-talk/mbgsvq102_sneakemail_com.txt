Hi Roger,
I began work on this a couple days ago but had to shelve it because of
my current work-load. I'll hopefully get round to wrapping up a basic
version this weekend which I'll make available for testing early next week..

Does anyone know why a client is instructing my TOR server to connect to
itself? Obviously this isn't expected behaviour as the logged message
indicates that the activity is a bug. Is the bug client or server-side?
Kind regards,

@_subject: Tor as windows service 
Hash: SHA1
Hi Martin,
If you follow the instructions in the FAQ (posted by Bob) and remember
to copy the files in the DataDirectory to C:\Program Files\Tor (posted
by Bob & Pat Frank) everything should work.
If Tor needs to have Administrator rights, start Services (from Control
Panel | Administrative Tools or just type services.msc from a command
prompt), right-click on the Tor service and select Properties. Click on
the Log On tab and check that it's set to Local System account. If it
still doesn't run you can force it to use a specific user account
(either Administrator, or a user that you've created that belongs to the
Administrators group).
Hope that helps.

@_subject: raise ulimit? 
Hash: SHA1
Give up and be happy! ;-)
Just kidding... On Windows, file descriptors are called file handles and
include socket handles as well as files. The limit is supposed to be
around 16384 (on W2K server) but there may also be a limit on the number
of file handles that a process may have. Maybe using one of the
following tools will help identify which process is hogging all the handles:
Handle -- a command-line tool to report information about open file handles.
Process Explorer -- a GUI interface tool that displays the number of
open file handles and more information about each running process.
Unfortunately there's not a lot of information about tweaking these
limits. Most resources simply recommend changing the TIME_WAIT Timeout
value in the registry to increase the number of available TCP/IP
connections (
Other than that, Good luck!

Have you tried SocksCap?
I've used it on a number of applications that aren't SOCKS "friendly" or
only support SOCKS 5. It provides support for both SOCKS 4 and SOCKS 5
and appears more stable than FreeCap. I tried FreeCap with varying
degrees of success.

@_subject: Have some consideration for users... 
Hash: SHA1
Hi Mark,
The bug you reported is for W95 systems only. As you yourself observed
(and later confirmed by Nick Mathewson and phobos), support for W95
isn't mentioned on the Tor website. The Windows installation
instructions clearly state that "...these are the installation
instructions for running a Tor client on MS Windows (98, 98SE, NT4,
2000, XP, Server)".
If users properly follow the installation instructions the warning
you're requesting should not necessary. As per "Step Four: Make sure
it's working", every installation should be tested *before* any
assumption of functionality and anonymity is made. The onus is on the
user to verify that everything works - the developers don't have the
time to hand-hold everyone using Tor.
APAS? Not certain what that is but I'm willing to be enlightened. I've
posted all my questions here and found the support from both the
developers and other Tor users to be prompt, to the point, and accurate.
None of my questions have gone unanswered and none of them have been
considered too trivial. At some point, everyone on this list started off
as a novice user. The thing to remember is that no one here is obliged
to help - so be polite and respectful and you're more likely to get
offered a solution (if there is one).
I'd hardly say that Tor has been poorly implemented! It does what it
does very well and is always being improved on. There are some bright
people working on the project and some equally bright people using and
testing it. Tor is a work in progress.
As for support, the website has just about everything you need to know
and more. Whatever isn't there can be found here. The community is very
helpful and hardly elitist. They come from all walks of life and are not
all *nix users. The installation is simple - even without an in-depth
knowledge of the operating system. For Windows users, what can be
simpler than downloading and running the installation program?
Hopefully you will as I cc'ed you.. :)
Your last question about the digest was buried in the same paragraph as
some info on Windows versions and Microsoft patches. It was easily
overlooked. At the risk of sounding confrontational, just as you don't
have time to look up why the list does not accept "normal" digest
commands, I'm sure that the developers and other list members don't either.
As for your initial post re "Command for Digest" going unanswered -
that's probably because no one else on the list knew the answer. I
hardly see the point of several dozen list members responding with
"Sorry - I dunno".
Did you try?
1) sending "help" in the message body to majordomo at seul.org
2) following the instructions in the OR-Talk welcome message:
"If you ever need to get in contact with the owner of the list, (if you
have trouble unsubscribing, or have questions about the list itself)
send email to . This is the general rule for
most mailing lists when you need to contact a human."
It didn't take more than 2 minutes to establish (and I stand corrected
by anyone in the know) that this version of Majordomo doesn't natively
support digest mode. From the Majordomo website:
"Digesting and Archiving will be integrated into Majordomo soon. In the
meantime, they require setting up additional aliases and configuring a
few other things."
I doubt that this has been set up for any of the OR lists. Why are you
sending the messages to Trash? Simply create a filter/rule and dump them
into another folder so that they don't clutter your Inbox. If you don't
want to receive the posts as they come in, unsubscribe and just use the
archives on the web (
Respectfully yours,

Hi Anothony,
Would it help if I wrote a command-line app in Delphi that accepts a
control port and a pseudo-signal as parameters, and returns the result
of the signal as an exit code that you could use in your batch file?
