The raspberry pi, although using the Debian architecture string "armhf"
in the raspbian Debian fork, is *NOT* compatible with Debian armhf
binaries.  Great, isn't it?
Therefore you cannot use any binaries built for Debian armhf, including,
but not limited to, the Debian packages on deb.torproject.org.
You'll either have to downgrade to the packages provided by raspbian, or
build your own raspbian binaries from source.
