@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor on Arm Device 
I've got Tor running on arm hardware running a debian based distribution.
There isn't a version of the Tor Browser Bundle for arm, so I'm accessing
Tor via Firefox. I'm wondering how I can best secure the browser.
I've already installed NoScript & HTTPS Everywhere... but how else can I
secure my local copy of Firefox to match the security offered by the
pre-assembled Tor Brower?
