@_subject: Setting up a private tor network 
I am trying to setup a private tor network and followed all the steps
mentioned in the FAQ list. Now when i start running the network initially it
used to run properly. But nowadays when i start the network is says do not
have enough directory information to build circuits. I tried commenting that
part out from the code so that it could build circuits all the time, but
then it says the directory info is too old to build circuits. And the
problem is these things keep popping up now and then. It works well for a
while but if i end up stopping the network and restarting again then it
gives this problem again.
I am actually using tor to implement certain things on top of it and hence
have the requirement of killing and restarting the tor nodes frequently.
Is there anyway i could setup static circuits for a while or reduce the
directory requirements so that a smal private network runs seemlessly?
Thanks for your help in advance.

I am using 0.1.2.17. I am planning to run an application over tor so i was
not sure puppetor will work. I think i will try using that. My problem is
that the logs say that there is enough directory information but still it
does not try to make a circuit. I changed the code so that it builds
circuits all the time. But, it is like tor is not running at all. It is
supposed to make a circuit once it gets directory information but is not
doing so. Are there any reasons why it is not able to do so?
