Please excuse my extreme ignorance, but does this mean my bridge isn't "Feb 11 17:44:09.219 [Notice] Have tried resolving or connecting to address '[scrubbed]' at 3 different places. Giving up."

@_subject: [tor-talk] Obfuscated Tor bridge 
I am using the instructions on  to set up an obfuscated Tor bridge. I get this far:
ABORTED: Tor configuration invalid:
Feb 14 19:11:38.039 [notice] Tor v0.2.2.35 (git-73ff13ab3cc9570d). This is experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity. (Running on Linux i686)
Feb 14 19:11:38.040 [warn] Failed to parse/validate config: Unknown option 'ServerTransportPlugin'.  Failing.
Feb 14 19:11:38.040 [err] Reading config failed--see warnings above.
Please, how can I fix this problem and continue with the instructions?

Please, what does this mean, and can I do something about it?
It is in the tor Iran obfsproxy bridge log file. I had to turn off my computer and on reboot have this repeatedly in the file. It's been waiting for ~45 minutes so far.

I am unable to add
        torbirdy-0.0.10.xpi
        --- TorBirdy 0.0.10
(or .0.0.09)
to Firefox. I get this message:
How do I fix this, and get Torbirdy working?
I may be doing something wrong.

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question. Please tell me where to send it if it's not.
For the last 3 days, every time I try to start Orbot to run Tor on my android phone, I get the message
Unable to start Tor: broken pipe.
How can I fix this, please?

I, probably in ignorance, am unable to download the xpi. Please can someone describe how to for me?
