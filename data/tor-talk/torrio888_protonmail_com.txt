@_subject: [tor-talk] Fake Tor Browser on Google play store 
On Google play store there is a fake Tor Browser called "Torn Browser" that claims to be "the only official mobile browser supported by the Tor Project, developers of the world?s strongest tool for privacy and freedom online".
If you install it and check your IP address you see that it doesn't use Tor at all.
