@_subject: [tor-talk] Two tor clients 
I have been experimenting with the thought of running two Tor clients at
once on my machine. So I decided to try it and modified the source a bit
to let me run two clients at once (of course with separate data dirs).
But they both get the same exit node, and if I try to switch exit node
on one of them via its control port, they both get switched. I'm a bit curious about this behavior. Anyone know why it's behaving like that?

I have been experimenting with this some more, and Tor always seem to
get the same IP, even if I run several separate clients (on the same
machine) at once.
Is this the expected behavior?
If yes, why and how does this work?
Anyone with some knowledge of this willing to share? :-)
