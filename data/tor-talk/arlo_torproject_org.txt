I wrote a little proof of concept rendering globe server-side with phantom.js

Tentatively, I would say an experimental build will be available in
Q4 of this year but, at the very least, the deliverable is due for the
sponsor in May (July?) of 2015.
More meaningfully, you can follow along (or participate) with some
of the tickets we?re working on,
And a short summary of a session from the latest dev meeting is
available at,
Thanks for your interest.

Right, they?re currently rendered client-side to a canvas.
Switching to svgs, as you mention below, would be necessary.
Sounds like you?re most of the way there.
I only suggested the phantomjs approach as a means to avoid a rewrite,
but since you?ve pretty much gone and done it,
we?re probably better off focussing on that.
Let me know if there?s anything I can help with.

Unfortunately, d3 has a binary dependency in contextify via jsdom.

The plan was to start with a js ctypes wrapper of libotr
and then, maybe sometime in the future, replace it with
an nss based implementation of otr.
To quote from the linked article,
"If you can deploy a custom plugin to clients, why not run
the crypto there? If it can access the host environment, it
has a real PRNG, crypto library (Mozilla NSS or Microsoft
CryptoAPI), etc. ?
This is what we intend to do. The crypto won?t be in js,
just the interface. Still plenty of room for error, but not
necessarily in the way this article advocates.
Moreover, the application will be deterministically built
and downloaded once, not on every request.
Well, the first version will be using libtor, which depends on libgcrypt.
Not offense taken :)
Thanks for the questions.
