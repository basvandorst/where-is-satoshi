@_subject: [tor-talk] How long does a normal client use Tor? Does Tor re-count 
Dear friends,
I am newbie to Tor. I just wandered around the Tor Metrics Website and
found that there are around 2 millions direct Tor user daily. So does
anyone know how long a client uses Tor in average? Or is there any research
paper or article gave a CDF graph for that?
If possible, then please let me ask the next question that: " Did the
number 2 million direct users provided by Tor Metrics already count for
unique users or just count basing on the number of directory-request sent
to Directory Authorities?"
Best Regards.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What is the different between cached-microdescs, 
Hi all,
I just have a look at ~/Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Data\Tor and see the
above mentioned 3 files. I don't really know how they are different in both
"content" and "role".
Which file is used to build circuit by Client?
Which File is used to checked "the validity of recent-possessing network
TO the best of my knowledge, client check whether there are any
downloadable descriptors (currently every 10 seconds according to
dir-spec.txt). So could anyone please explain or give me a hint of how the
client really "CHECK" that?
For example:
in the cached-microdesc-consensus file contains a descriptor
r PDrelay1 AAFJ5u9xAqrKlpDW6N0pMhJLlKs 2015-03-09 10:53:09 95.215.44.189
8080 0
m CPe8dnlRHAy8MxrtSS1QTQzlZl8fesAIahWCwUz5W5U
s Fast Running Stable Valid
v Tor 0.2.5.10
w Bandwidth=404
in the cached-microdescs file contains this:
-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
ntor-onion-key 8VFLG7Hs7Phh8vdNCZDOmHUfVu8wa75UgSbj7A+wFig=
a [2a02:7aa0:1619::9847:f57c]:8080
family $2224E7AF8101885850EC7F2F9EB99F823E8014BE
id rsa1024 AAFJ5u9xAqrKlpDW6N0pMhJLlKs
 2015-03-09 03:46:20
So which value Client will parse and send to Directory Mirrors to Check if
a descriptor is still valid or invalid in this case, is that the
"AAFJ5u9xAqrKlpDW6N0pMhJLlKs", cos I can only find this is the only common
value between two files?
Will Client have to send all of "that-value" of all recent possessing
descriptors to Mirrors to test? If yes, how the Mirrors will handle those
Thank you for reading my question, and please correct me if I said
something wrong.
Yours Sincerely.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Data missed up in Tor Metrics, A bug? 
Dear Mod of Tor-metrics,
I just checked this link: and found that the date column does not ordered the dates correctly. In
more details, after the date:09/03/2015, some other dates in the past
appear here 06/03/2011, 01/09/2011 and so on...
Is that normal, or because my Microsoft Excel has some problems?
Please check it out.
Best Regards.

Dear Karsten,
Thank you for your prompt reply to my question, I just wondered whether
there was a bug or not. It should be no problem at all since the ordering
stuffs can be done just by one click in Excel. By the way, you said that "That
file is not ordered by date", so can you please tell me by which variable
the file is order? And does it happen only to the client.csv or also other
csv files?
Yours Sincerely.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Why is there a huge gap between Total BW retrieved by 
Hi all,
? I just try fetching some information in the descriptors consensus from
directory authorities via Stem library. After fetching and sum up the
bandwidth, I got this number: 30841602 kilobytes, which is around 246 Gbit.
It is quite different from the number of around 60GBit/s of bandwidth
history, and 125 Gbit/s for Advertised bandwidth in Tor Metrics:
I know that the bandwidth I fetched via Stem library is the line w in
consensus document stated here:
P/S: Code I wrote to fetch bw is:
? Next, simultaneously I checked bandwidth of a particular IP (say,
In Consensus, it shows 264 (
In Vote, it shows 604 (
and in  it shows 66KB
By reading the Direcroty Protocol, I can figure out the difference between
Consensus and Vote, but Why the last line is also different from both Consensus
and Vote? Do anyone has any idea of how the site gets the 66KB/s number for
Looking forward to receiving any comment or answer from you!
Yours Sincerely.

Thank you Dr. Karsten for your answer.
Following your instruction, I am now understanding meaning of three terms:
"advertised bandwidth", "bandwidth history", and "consensus weight" on
Metrics. So please let me link those term with terms in Stem, and please
correct me if I am wrong cos I am using Stem Library so I really need to
know which term in Metrics is associated with which term in Stem:
Syntax: 1. advertised bandwidth = observed_bandwidth
to check it: I look at atlas of the IP: 94.198.68.13, and found advertised
from stem.descriptor.remote import DescriptorDownloader
  for desc in downloader.get_server_descriptors().run():
 print '%s %i' %(IP, desc.observed_bandwidth)
2. bandwidth history = Not Available (?)
3. consensus weight = bandwidth or = measured
This one maybe the weirdest one, but please correct me if I misunderstand
Next what I tried to figure out the question myself by writing these code
from stem.descriptor.remote import DescriptorDownloader
  for desc in downloader.get_consensus().run():
 print '%s %i' %(IP, desc.measured)
and get
95.215.44.189 None
While if I use this code lines:
from stem.descriptor.remote import DescriptorDownloader
  for desc in downloader.get_consensus().run():
 print '%s %i' %(IP, desc.bandwidth)
I would get this result:
 95.215.44.189 323
which is exactly the same with values in consensus file @
Therefore, I am confused about consensus weight (in metrics VS in directory
specification) VS bandwidth and measured (in Stem). Which of them is
unit-less, and which of them is in B/s or KB/s. And, which value one should
use to calculate probability of a relay in path selection in proportion to
its bandwidth.
I am so sorry if the way I raise and organize the question make you
confused or hard to understand. Especially to Dr. Karsten, I am so sorry to
ask you about Stem in related to Metrics cos I am aware that Stem in not
under your management.
Yours Sincerely!
