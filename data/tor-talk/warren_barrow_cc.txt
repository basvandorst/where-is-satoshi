I am almost certain that the system was compromised due to b2evolution (phpBB, too, if it uses xmlrpc).  Many PHP applications are vulnerable due to issues within XML RPC, specifically  .. There are readily available exploits available that will give the attacker a command line via this vector.  With that said - if you configured Apache to run as a restricted user (ie: nobody), then the attacker would have only modified pages in which the restricted account had access to write.
There are mass autorooter worms traveling around that perform this automatically: successfully exploit, change all index.* pages, drop an IRC/DDos Daemon into a hidden (or not so hidden directory. hint: check Run a find command to look for all modified files within the last N hours.

find / -user nobody -mtime -1 -print
run this perl script to exploit yourself:

Thanks for the information. I am using the new libevent with TOR 0.1.0.10 and have remained operational for several days now.  I changed my server config to act only as a middleman due to my lack of resources (700mhz, 128mb ram on a FreeBSD laptop).  My server is pushing between 100-400 KB/sec with the TOR process sitting at almost idle.  I'm extremely pleased with the FYI- two days ago I introduced a friend to TOR.  He immediately logged into his server, set up TOR (crackhoe), and is now pushing a nice amount of traffic.  It's good to see additional high speed servers come online.
Lastly, I received my TOR tshirt a couple of weeks ago.  Anyone that hasn't received a tshirt should definitely get one if they are still

I don't think the TOR server with parameters you specified can determine whether your traffic should be allowed over other client connections.  The server was given a max option and stopped processing once it reached the limit.  Why don't you just set up a client only TOR server for your own personal use on your desktop/laptop?

Hi-  I've experienced a problem every couple of days where my TOR server would crash.  The last entry found in the logs would indicate:
[err] do_main_loop(): libevent poll with kqueue failed: Inva
lid argument [22]
...that may not be of much help without the core file. I just upgraded to 1.0.6 and will see how it works.

@_subject: Problems with TOR & FreeBSD 
I am trying to track down an issue I am experiencing with TOR on FreeBSD 5.3.  I had a problem once where TOR v0.1.0.5 core dumped while using libevent 1.0e.  I upgraded libevent to 1.1 and have tried the new editions of TOR as they were made available.  I only received the coredump that one time.  My behavior now is TOR will run for a short while then error out with the following entries:
May 20 15:13:40.870 [warn] connection_about_to_close_connection(): Bug: Closing stream (marked at connection.c:1000) without sending back a socks reply.
May 20 15:13:49.616 [err] do_main_loop(): libevent poll with kqueue failed: Invalid argument [22]
I'm not sure if the first message is related to the problem that brings TOR down or just a side effect of TOR dying.
At this point I've backe down to 0.0.9.9 and will monitor the system.
Any help is appreciated.
