It depends on the location of the exit node. I saw changing the above

No encryption anymore!
Only ' ('xx' = country code) seems to be
constant regardless of the location of the exit node.
So for me ' is the better choice.

@_subject: ExitNodes for encrypted connects only are not possible. Why? 
In 'git.torproject.org/checkout/tor/master/doc/spec/dir-spec.txt'
ExitNodes are defined as:
   "Exit" -- A router is called an 'Exit' iff it allows exits to at
    least two of the ports 80, 443, and 6667 and allows exits to at
    least one /8 address space.
I would like to setup my ExitNode for ports 443, 465, 563, 993, 995
(https, ssmtp, nntps, imaps, pop3s) only, but this is not possible.
What's the reason behind this? Is there any chance to loose this
restriction in one of the next releases?

Ok, have you checked the symbolic links in '/etc/rc2.d'..'/etc/rc.d' as
ls -l /etc/rc?.d/*privoxy*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 17 2010-06-13 11:27 /etc/rc0.d/K20privoxy ->

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 17 2010-06-13 11:27 /etc/rc6.d/K20privoxy ->
I think it doesn't matter. Here the owner of *templates/*' is root and
privoxy works perfect for me.

@_subject: BetterPrivacy - necessary? 
I think 'BetterPrivacy' is a "must"! [1]
IMHO its important to suppress active content (Flash, ActiveX,
Silverlight, JavaScript etc.) and other junk and therefor I prefer
'Privoxy' [1] instead of Polipo.

Get your 'external' address ( and start your

Better: Create a free hostname (  etc.) and
use this for your bridge relay.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Bursts of 'many circuit creation requests' 
Did you reboot your dsl router? IIRC, there was a similar problem when I
run a Tor relay behind my Fritz!Box (AVM). After max. 10 days online,
connections where drastically slowed down by the box (lack of ressources).
Rebooting the box every sunday was a good workaround for a while. In the
meantime my dsl router was replaced by a dedicated dsl modem + router
(pfsense) - no more such problems since then.
I don't know. If you run your relay an Linux, you can use 'iptables'
with the module 'recent' to limit new connections/second.
I don't think that the cpu is the limitting factor. My Tor relay is
running on such a machine (Alix-Board) too, (bandwidthrate 64000 B)
without problems.
