My ISP Blocked most of tor servers that provide the "cached-routers".
any Idea how to bypass this issue !
I use a vpn connection to connect to another ISP and wait until tor get the circuit complete.
i save the cached-routers file and rename it, when tor empty the original file i replace it with the one i have and it work again.

Yes I am from U.A.E - Dubai, My ISP is "Etisalat", I dont thing they will listen to me cause they are blocking many ports, sites and services.
What I was thinking of, why dont TOR network use a dynamic IP's for their servers, and use base64 to encode all tor network data , this will make it hard to identify a signature on TOR server to filter it.
Thanks and keep on the good work,

its loop the message " update_router_descriptor_client_downloads(): Not enough networkstatus documents to launch requests."
there is also no cached-routers under ~/.tor
any idea ?

Hi James, Thanks for you replay.
I left tor run for one day. and it keep repeating the same message.
I can ping the directory server.
also I'am running "tor" fine on other linux and windows box's on the same network.
I reinstall tor on my FreeBSD box, and still the same thing.
