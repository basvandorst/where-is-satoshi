yeah I understand it would make Tor a spammers paradise... that would be a big drawback
But if i am correct you say there is a way to still be able to send email through tor?
Can my ISP provide me with an alternate SMTP port? and.. this is going to sound dumb... what is a relay-server and how do I find one?

ps: am i correct that if i use a webbased email account(for example gmail) without pop3 and I use (Torified)Firefox to acces it I CAN send emails out without the receiver being able to see my personal IP etc?
I dont mind of they se my email address ofcourse as they need that to reply to me, just dont want them to be able to view my info.

Tanks Mike for your fast and helpful replies
I am not that worried about traces of activities left on my computer. I just want to be sure receivers of email wont be able t see my IP and stuff.
So if i use a web based email and use firefox with Tor to access it with my normal settings(the settings that I always use when i use the Internet) so not a totally separate profile.The receiver still wont be able to trace me right? I understand that for complete security I should make a new browser profile so the cookies wont mix. but as cookies are on my own computer they have nothing to do with any info the receiver of email might be able to get from the header or whatever of the email i sent, am i correct?
Some web based email services,like mail.com if i am not mistaken, give you the option to download a little prog that warns you when a new emailis in.
Does this affect my anonymity? I suppose it does as the server from mail.com will connect to my comp to tell me there is a new message. On the other hand, if I use tor enabled firefox wouldn't that connection also be anonymous?
last question: Why cant I access the account without Tor?(safety wise i mean). As long as i dont send any emails to anyone isnt it safe? I understand my ISP and mail.com will be able to trace me but not receivers of emails as I am not sending any at that moment.

Thanks Mike,
Ill go check that out!
Great it works with outlook too.
I have both outlook and thunderbird installed but i must say i prefer outlook in the end cause of its speed... thunderbird is rather slow on my crappy computer... it does have nice extras outlook express doesn't have like spam and unwanted mail filters though.
Id also like to contribute to Tor by having my computer available for it. ill have to look into that later though...got it get a hang of it myself first ;)

Dont know but it totally would I guess.
Do you think you have the capacity for it?
You have to be careful though as tehre are always ppl out there abusing a service like that... but i assume youhave a way to fight that...

@_subject: Question for Job and others / was: Re: Tor and Thunderbird:	Outgoing 
Hello George,
I understand your point of view. Indeed, I am not a US resident and therefor not limited by US law.
I live in The Netherlands where privacy is still much more of an issue and -for example- downloading(but not uploading) of music etc is legal.(so are soft-drugs, abortion and gay marriage btw)
The Dutch are far from repressed i think ;)
The way you describe it makes it sound a bit shady I think. My reasons for wanting my emails to be anonymous is not because of harassment or spam. Actually i wouldn't even know how to send spam.
The concern -for me-  is not one related to my ISP as I don't anything to violate their policies or break laws and actually i am not using an obscure email account (yet).
I want to offer my future clients the option of contacting me and me contacting them without for example the receivers spouse, family, friends or boss being able to trace anything due to the nature of the service I will provide as this is related to topics that are highly personal. Unfortunately I cant elaborate on this too much due to the exact same reasons. The most I can share with anyone at this point is that its in the field of Psychology. This causes me to be able to offer a level of service that from the receivers side is totally untraceable or near untraceable( however, like i stated before, i DO want them to be able to contact me too) That is also why i am not very concerned about the traces left on my own computer as these are not accessible by the significant others of the client. I want to make the barrier to take that first step to get into contact as low as possible. The anonymous email is just part of the privacy I want to offer but since I am just looking into the online anonymity option and I am new at Tor this seems to be a good place to start and look for extra information.

as far as I know it deletes the keys that are left over by any program that is not installed anymore and other "old"stuff.
I cant promise anything ofcourse ;)

like i said I don't promise anything...i am just saying its worked for
me to clean up my registry. I dont mind of there is some old stuff left
but it did speed up my comp a bit.
I didn't offer it as a solution to the question asked, just as a suggestion

@_subject: Tor and Thunderbird: Outgoing Email Unsafe? 
I just got Tor to be safer online and used the Tor-button to automatically confugure Firefox and Thunderbird for Tor.
In Thunderbird however I have to exclude the server I use to SEND emails from being handled by Tor.
Maybe I am wrong but doesnt this defeat the whole purpose of Tor? Cause if my outgoing email is not handled by Tor the receives can still see my IP and all the other data and so can easely identify me.
The most essential thing is to have the outgoing emails handeled by Tor so the receiver can see my private information right?
How do I set thunderbird in such a waythat the receiver of my emails wont be able to trace me or see my private info(IP etc etc)?
