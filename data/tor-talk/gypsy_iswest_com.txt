@_subject: Too many connections when ORPort is defined 
I would like to run a tor server, but there is no way to limit the
number of connections.  Also my tor.log gets filled with "Failing
because we have 991 connections already. Please raise your ulimit -n."
which is crap I do not care to see.
Development REALLY needs to implement a connection limit so that tor can
be configured to be less a resource pig.  While there is an
overabundance of bandwidth here, the host computer simply cannot handle
more than 100 simultaneous connections because it has so little RAM and
a "low horsepower" CPU.
If that ever happens, you might want to notify me (off list because I
won't still be subscribed), at which time I'll turn the server back on.
Note that bandwith limiting is not effective, either via htb or htb +
configuration options in torrc.

Well, I can't - in twice that much RAM.  The machine becomes extremely
sluggish, more and more so as the number of connections increases.
Read the next paragraph of that entry.  It does not limit the number of
connections.  So it doesn't do what I need, although it will remove the
"991 connections" log entries.
I'd certainly appreciate pointers for finding such a patch.  I haven't
read every message in this group, but a google search "patch tor
connection limit" came up empty.
