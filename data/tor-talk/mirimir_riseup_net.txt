Even without Qcomputers, there are simple strategies that might prevent
decryption. Fundamentally, one would first encrypt a file. Then one
would split it into N pieces, and encrypt each piece, using a different
public key (and perhaps using a different one for each piece). Then one
would upload the pieces to various sharing sites, with each one in
multiple places, but only 20%-50% of the pieces on any one site. One
would spread the uploads and downloads over several days, or more.
The weakness, of course, is the storage plan. But that could be
negotiated in advance, privately, and not retained locally by any party
to the distribution.
How about that?
That seems likely.

It's hard to know what Windows systems and Microsoft etc are

I've read that, in Windows 8.x, Microsoft can monitor installed apps,
and can remove those it deems dangerous. If that's true, it could
readily determine who's running Tor. Maybe it could even modify the Tor
client. Do we know that it couldn't?
The money trail is a fundamental distinction between Windows and OSX,
versus Linux and other free operating systems. If I choose, I can
readily download and update Ubuntu, for example, through whatever arcane
combination of VPNs and Tor that suits me.
Doing that with Windows or OSX is much, much harder. Unless one uses
cracked versions, there's a money trail. Cracking takes some skill, and
third-party cracked versions are arguably even more dangerous.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TOR bundle on hostile platforms: why? 
As you say, Tails is great because it's a LiveCD with no persistent
storage by default. But it's still running Tor and browser etc in the
same machine, so exploits can mess with Tor and networking stack.
Running Tor and apps in separate VMs is far safer. Whonix and Incognito
do that with pairs of gateway and workstation VMs in VirtualBox. Qubes
does that (and far more isolation) using a custom, hardened hypervisor.
Running apps in VM(s) and Tor on the host is almost as secure. I wonder
whether that could be done in a LiveCD that would be widely usable. The
main problem using VirtualBox is that both host and VM need desktops.
Even using light distros, that leads to fairly large LiveDVDs, which
require substantial RAM to boot.
A Qubes LiveCD would be very cool.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Secure email with limited usable metadata 
That was a good suggestion, and it's great that you're still listening.
It's true that Bitcoin is not, by default, at all anonymous. And it's
become much harder, over the past year or so, to buy anonymously.
However, it is possible to "anonymize" Bitcoins using multiple wallets
with mixing services via Tor. After a few transfers, one is left with a
random mixture, which includes none of one's initial Bitcoins. Although
adversaries can determine the history of every Bitcoin fragment using
the blockchain, none of those histories includes the spender's initial
non-anonymous purchase.
Even so, there are associations with the mixing services. In particular,
the spender's initial non-anonymous purchase is associated with the
first mixing service. But after the third mix, that association is
arguably too diffused to be useful.
What's the defect with that approach?
It's actually quite easy using Multibit clients (which are local but
don't download the blockchain) in Tails, Whonix, Incognito, etc.

@_date: 2013-08-11 21:34:15
@_author: mirimir 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Secure email with limited usable metadata 
But you're still buying them non-anonymously. Even buying with cash on
the street isn't very anonymous. And using a Bitcoin mixing service is
rather a red flag, no?
Right. With more Bitcoin users and longer circulation, stronger
anonymity through mixing will become possible. On the other hand, as the
Bitcoin economy has become larger, state monitoring has increased, and
even semi-anonymous purchasing has become harder. For example,
BitInstant imposed identity verification, and then shut down.
There's a potentially very large market niche for selling Bitcoins
anonymously, but the logistical challenges are immense.
An app with multiple wallets that automatically anonymized via Tor would
be very cool!
Do you think that Google might be an early adopter?
If not, I wonder who would.

That's true.
Well, one can use a VPN service through Tor. It's doable in Whonix or
with ra's gateway, and maybe in Tails (with persistent storage). But I
believe that reduces the anonymity that Tor can provide, because there's
a persistent connection that prevents circuit switching.
Also, unless you're willing to mail cash or thoroughly anonymize some
Bitcoins, it needs to be a free VPN service. SecurityKISS works, but
throttles and limits daily throughput.

You can force your own DNS servers. It's easy using Network Manager, or
with pfSense router/firewall VMs as openvpn clients.
Also, I'm not very concerned about SecurityKISS using Google DNS
servers, given that I'm connecting to them through Tor, and then through
SecurityKISS. Using firewall rules and routing, you can prevent leaks
around both the Tor and SecurityKISS tunnels.

Yes, you can pay with Bitcoins. But first, you must anonymize them

Multibit clients work well over Tor. They're local, but they don't

It's true that using a single VPN doesn't provide anonymity, because the
provider can log everything. I could have been clearer that I wasn't
talking about that approach.
Getting back to the original question, what is the most anonymous way to
reliably get a US IP address? Is it more anonymous to (1) force Tor to
use some set of US exit relays, or (2) tunnel a free VPN through Tor?
The VPN connection does prevent Tor from switching circuits. Does that
reduce Tor anpnymity more than just constraining exit relay selection?
If so, one could configure the VPN to reconnect periodically.

As I understand Tor, that's precisely what Tor doesn't do. Its goal is
providing security through relatively-strong anonymity to all users.
If, by "relatively lax security for 'general' users", you're referring
to having NoScript configured by default to allow all sites, that's
arguably the best option for most users. Any user can choose to block
scripts by default on all sites, or allow on a per-site basis, trading
off anonymity for protection against script-based exploits.
Also, any user who's that concerned about script-based exploits ought to
be running the Tor client and their apps in separate machines, or at

I agree that it's fairly easy to miss that little NoScript alert button

deserves a far more prominent warning.
As discussed on Tor's blog, it's a trade-off. Arguably, far more
clueless noobs would be put at risk through deanonymization via browser
signature than by exploits on high-risk hidden services. That's the Tor
Project's position, as I read it.
And I still maintain that users who visit high-risk hidden services are
responsible for properly securing their systems. But again, maybe that

Yes, Tor will connect through the VPN service. Your ISP will see that
you're using the VPN service, but won't see Tor connections. The Tor
network will see your VPN service gateway instead of your ISP assigned

Both Tor and VPN services hide your browsing activity from your ISP, and

I don't think so.
There needs to be a VPN tunnel wherever Alice wants Tor to carry UDP
traffic. If Alice wants to connect with Bob via an Internet VoIP
service, such as Twilio, she needs to use a third-party VPN service.
It would look like this:
Alice running Tor and OpenVPN --[OpenVPN connection in TCP mode via
Tor]--> VPN server --[Internet]--> VoIP server --[however Bob
connects]--> Bob
The simplest way to route VPNs through Tor is with Whonix. She would
just install OpenVPN on the Whonix workstation, and copy the VPN
service's connection files to /etc/openvpn. At boot, openvpn connects to
the designated VPN server via Tor.
Alice's anonymity with that approach is limited by the money trail to
the VPN service that she's using. Free VPNs wouldn't suffice because of
their throughput limits. Some VPN services accept cash through the mail,
however, and allow connections via Tor.
Alternatively, Alice could (1) run her own OpenVPN server as a Tor
hidden service, and (2) run her own VoIP server that accepts connections
on the VPN. Bob etc would run Whonix with an OpenVPN client, and connect
to Alice's hidden service. That provides Alice with better anonymity,
but it's harder to set up.

If you run a VPN client and Tor client on the same machine, you will
connect to the Tor network through the VPN. I should have mentioned that

I've assumed that VPNs are generally less suspicious than Tor, given
their popularity for file sharing. Also, file sharing through the VPN

hide the Tor traffic.

SSH and VPNs are vulnerable to fingerprinting because latency is low,

I'm not an iptables expert, so I'll defer to others.
What I should have said is that running a VPN client and TBB on the same
machine will route Tor through the VPN.
It's the transparent proxy setup that complicates matters.
The more the better, I think. How much of your 10GB per month limit do
you typically use? Devoting about half of your limit to file sharing
seems reasonable.
But 10GB per month is only about 30Kbps 24/7, which probably wouldn't
help too much, given that Tor typically hits 1-2Mbps. You could only run
the file sharing app while using Tor. And you could also limit Tor
bandwidth, as painful as that might be.

I agree with tor at x...x (on Wed, 06 Mar 2013 21:34:29 +0000)
that separating hidden services from Tor clients on different
machines (virtual or better, physical) prevents them from
finding their IP addresses, even if they are compromised.
However, as Roger notes, hidden services typically do "stay
in the same place". And adversaries can of course "induce
them to speak", "as often as they want" (and in whatever
patterns that they specify).
Even so, if there are multiple hidden service instances with
the same credentials, clients will get whichever instance has
announced most recently. Also, given that hidden services and
Tor clients are running on different machines, one hidden
service machine could access multiple Tor client machines over
back channels such as VPNs, Tor and/or I2P. Alternatively, or
in addition, multiple hidden service machines could rely on
back-end data stored in globally distributed and redundant
fashion (using Tahoe-LAFS, for example) and accessed over
various back channels.
In that way, hidden services could move, either randomly or
in response to suspected attacks. And the data that they
serve would not originate in one particular place. Also,
being stored in globally distributed and redundant fashion,
the data would be very hard to identify and eliminate.

Yes, you can route Tor through VPN services, to prevent your ISP etc
from seeing that you use Tor. You can also route VPN services through
Tor, to prevent Internet sites from seeing Tor exits. And you can do
both simultaneously. Using VM networking, it's not very difficult.
If you'll be routing VPN services through Tor, you want to use ones that
are free, so there's no money trail. If you use paid VPN services, your
anonymity will be proportional to the difficulty in following the money
trail. Also, your anonymity will be limited by the uniqueness of the
browser signature etc that you reveal to Internet sites. That includes,
of course, the identity of the VPN service that you're routing through Tor.

First, as others have noted, you don't want to just add Tor. At a
minimum, install the Tor Browser Bundle.
The Tor Project publishes a list of Tor exit nodes. And your apparent IP
address changes at ten minute intervals, when Tor changes circuits.
Unless Tor use is common in your beloved community, you will stand out.
And if you come across as familiar with that community, your new
account(s) may be banned for ban evasion.
Whatever you do, it would be prudent to wait a while before doing it.
Also, have you contacted support with suitable apologies and promises to
be good?
As others have noted, don't mix anonymous and non-anonymous activities
on the Tor Browser. Potential identity leakage is one risk. There's also
the risk that your banks and credit card providers will lock your
accounts after access from numerous Tor-exit IP addresses.
The simplest solution is using a different browser for non-anonymous
activities. As Roger noted, don't mess with the Tor browser.
A better solution would be installing VirtualBox and Whonix. That way,
your anonymous activities would be isolated in the Whonix workstation
VM, and your non-anonymous activities would be in the host machine.
The Tor browser will tell you whether Tor is working or not.

one of his administrators, perhaps the one (with a huge drug debt) that

Said employee had full admin access to his servers.
His employee then provided his ACTUAL PHYSICAL ADDRESS to the undercover

The story in the Maryland complaint

It could be all lies, of course. Maybe it's an FBI/NSA scheme to hide
the evidence that they got by compromising Tor. But I'd want some
evidence for that hypothesis, not just the claim that it's possible.
Indeed, he was totally unprepared for any of that. According to the
Maryland complaint, he delegated the transfer of 1 Kg "cocaine" to the
guy who was administering his servers! And then that guy got busted, and
made a deal with the FBI. The rest of it was all manipulated by the FBI,
total entrapment, in my opinion.
He's not a criminal! He was just playing at being one ;) He was
apparently a fool to give someone he didn't have any reason to trust
full access to his servers. He should have hired a professional

So it seems that Employee was pretending to be the Vendor. Or maybe they

anything yet specifically about information about SR being passed from
NSA to FBI. But we do know about the US DEA Special Operations Division
("SOD") that received information from the NSA. There's a long quote
about that in a post from Gordon Morehouse [Message-ID:
<524EE6D5.4080901 at morehouse.me> ; Date: Fri, 04 Oct 2013 09:03:33 -0700].
I don't think that tracking down SR users, or even SR vendors, was the
FBI's main goal. Their main goal was taking down SR. They were under
considerable pressure from US politicians to shut down SR. They had to
do it, and do it quickly, or lose face.

Nobody is plausibly claiming that VPN services are as anonymous as Tor
is. However, it's just as easy to tap uplinks for Tor routers. But of
course, there are (probably) many more Tor routers than VPN services.
And Tor routers are distributed among several spheres of influence, some
of which don't cooperate readily.
Still, if one uses nested VPN tunnels from multiple providers in
suitably chosen spheres of influence, it will be nontrivial for
adversaries to install enough taps. Going through China, for example,
would be a serious roadblock for US-aligned TLAs. Even with four nested
VPN tunnels, latency and bandwidth are far better than using Tor.
Finally, it's not either/or. It's easy to include Tor in nested VPN
configurations. Latency is typically over two seconds, but bandwidth is
adequate, especially for UDP traffic.

True :)
I see much potential for using "resilient, distributed, encrypted" (and
better yet, hidden) storage backends for hidden services. Freenet is one
possibility. Tahoe-LAFS is another. Cleversafe would have been another,
had it stayed open-source.
I'm imagining a system where each storage node is a hidden service.
Nodes would link via VPN tunnels through Tor. Nodes would either have
local storage, or securely access various cloud storage services. Given
that nodes would only be storing splits of encrypted data, cloud storage
is safe enough.
Servers accessible to users would be diskless reverse proxies, via VPN
through Tor, for servers running hidden services. Those servers would
also be diskless, pulling hidden service credentials and content from
backend storage grids via VPN through Tor.

Yes, Tor supports only TCP. But OpenVPN can optionally use TCP, and once
the VPN tunnel is established, it supports both TCP and UDP traffic.
It's easy to tunnel a VPN through Tor using Whonix in VirtualBox. First
get a free SecurityKISS account. Then install network-manager-openvpn on
the Whonix workstation, and configure Network Manager for SecurityKISS
in TCP mode. By default, Whonix will use the transproxy port for
OpenVPN. Once the VPN tunnel is up, you can use both TCP and UDP with
remote sites. However, you can't access hidden services, for obvious
You can also run an OpenVPN server in TCP mode as a Tor hidden service.
You install the server on the Whonix workstation, and configure torrc on
the Whonix gateway. Alternatively, you can use ra's Tor gateway, which
is an OpenWRT VM with a Tor client and DHCP server, plus a Debian VM for
the OpenVPN server.
More generally, you can use multiple pfSense router/firewall VMs as
clients for various VPN providers, and OpenWRT Tor gateway VMs. Internet
traffic routing reflects the local routing of gateway VMs.

Congratulations! That is very cool. I've long wondered how this might work.
However, there is the concern that traffic will be linked to you through
the VPN provider, unless you've paid anonymously and masked your IP
address somehow. That's also an issue when running hosted exit relays.
But with the VPN approach, the exit traffic traverses your computer
through the VPN, instead of merely traversing a remote server that
you're renting.
Also, why did you go with the VPN approach, instead of just running an
exit hosted at, for example, Voxility in Romania? VPN services are less
expensive than hosted servers, even VPS. But are there other reasons?

For using Bitcoins via Tor, the best option that I know is the Multibit
wallet in Whonix. Multibit doesn't download the (many GB) blockchain,
which reduces both Tor network load and user frustration. And yet
Multibit is a local client, not subject to third-party failure.
If Tor relay operators want Bitcoin tips, they can figure out some way
to do that without Tor Project blessing. Unless and until Bitcoin, or
some derivative thereof, is by default anonymous, the idea of
incorporating them in Tor is absurd.

As krishna e bara notes, online anonymity is arguably impossible. Tor at

Although VPNs, even nested chains of VPNs, at best provide far less
anonymity than Tor does, they're useful in at least two ways. First,
accessing Tor obfuscated bridges via VPNs can further reduce the chance
of one's Tor use being discovered. Second, routing free VPNs such as

I think so. Because it can use UDP through the VPN tunnel, there's
virtually no break-up. Latency is high (1-2 seconds) but that's just a
fact of using Tor. Voice quality is better than typical cellphone.
Mumble was expressly designed for high-latency connections, so it has
good interactive tools for optimizing voice quality.
I've heard good things about Jabber. However, all SIP apps depend on

trusts ones ISP vs ones VPN provider.
Using VPNs tunneled through Tor is always less anonymous than using Tor
alone. Even with free VPNs, the exit IP does not change, except in a
limited way using different VPN exits. Also, Tor circuits don't change
except when the VPN reconnects.

This is an old story. Here is an explanation from Wired[0]:
They didn't get the "real" IP address through the browser. Magneto just
sent information to the FBI's server directly, rather than through Tor.
Also, Magneto is a Windows executable ;)
Proper firewall rules would have prevented that leak. Those using Whonix
weren't affected, because nothing in the workspace knows the "real" IP
address (and also because it's Debian, not Windows).

This was indeed an extraordinary circumstance. And it is misleading to
focus on the importance of blocking Javascript. It's also evidence for
using the latest Tor browser release, avoiding Windows, etc.
However, I do see a "told you so" here. It's foolish to think that
simply using the Tor browser is adequate protection for doing stuff
where there are serious consequences. Maybe the the comment "Everything
you need to safely browse the Internet. This package requires no
installation. Just extract it and run." on the download page needs a

I doubt it. From time to time, people ask about using this or that VoIP
protocol via Tor. I don't recall success stories. VoIP works best with
UDP for data channel, and TCP for control channel. But Tor doesn't
handle UDP, and pure TCP-mode VoIP via Tor seems useless. Decent VoIP is
doable via Tor using OnionCat or TCP-mode VPN to handle UDP. But that
won't be going mainstream any time soon, I think.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Free Decentralized VOIP over Tor 
Yes, it is[0]. I've used it in Whonix, with OpenVPN to handle both TCP
and UDP. Basically, you setup an OpenVPN server (using PKI) in one
Whonix workstation VM, and configure a hidden service in the Whonix
gateway VM that points to it. Then you install Mumble in the workstation
VM, and setup a server pointing to localhost. To avoid IP conflict, you
must change the gateway-workstation network from default 192.168.0.0/24
to 192.168.1.0/24 (or whatever).
Others using Whonix install OpenVPN and Mumble. The OpenVPN clients
connect via SocksPort, using OpenVPN's "socks-proxy server port up"
(where up contains the username/password for the local Whonix gateway)
and "socks-proxy-retry" options. The Mumble clients connect (via VPN via
Tor) to the Mumble server at 192.168.1.11 (or whatever IP the remote
workstation VM is at).
There's considerable latency (1-2 seconds) but sound quality is
otherwise excellent, better than typical cellphone. Mumble is designed
for in-game conversation, and includes an excellent quality-optimization
But that's mostly of historical interest, I think. I see that Linphone
works well via OnionCat.[1,2]. And Linphone uses the standard SIP
protocol, so you're not limited to users on a particular Mumble server.

Your client downloads information about all available relays from
directory servers. It picks three that have the guard flag as its entry
guards. Then it starts constructing three-relay circuits, all starting
with one of the entry guards, and ending with a relay that has the exit
Before the client sends data packets (cells) out through circuits, it
encrypts each multiple times. First it encrypts using the public key of
the exit relay. Next it adds an instruction to forward to that exit
relay, and encrypts to the public key of the middle relay. Then it adds
an instruction to forward to that middle relay, and encrypts to the
public key of the entry guard.
Then it sends that to the entry guard. The entry guard decrypts, and
forwards as instructed to the middle relay. The middle relay decrypts,
and forwards as instructed to the exit relay. And the exit relay
forwards to the specified destination.
The entry guard knows the client and the middle relay, but not the exit
relay or the destination. The middle relay knows the entry guard and the
exit relay, but not the client or the destination. The exit relay knows
the middle relay and destination, but not the entry guard or the client.
You can specify more or less relays to use in circuits, but less is
unwise, and more is arguably overkill.

Even the NSA, with global intercepts, is apparently not doing

Bluffdale is fully functional.
But Sybil attacks are clearly feasible, and require just some cloud
servers and the skills to use them. See Johnson et al. (2013).[0] It
seems that Sybil attacks against Tor are limited in scale not so much by
an adversary's resources, but rather through oversight by Tor Project
staff. Even though Tor is an open network, relays that behave
suspiciously get evicted.

million simultaneous Tor users. If each has three active circuits, there
are about six million concurrent circuits.
Tracing a particular Tor circuit would entail correlating traffic from
one intercept (presumably starting with an exit relay, or an entry
guard) with several million traffic intercepts from at most a few
thousand other relays. That would be trivial for a global adversary,
given the intercepts.
By "full-network traffic correlation", I meant cross correlating in real
time all of the several million concurrent traffic intercepts from all
Tor relays. That would yield a database of conversations, with such data
fields as user IP, entry guard ID, exit ID and destination site.
That would arguably involve on the order of 10^13 comparisons for each
snapshot, with snapshots perhaps every few minutes. Can the NSA manage
that? Shall we take a poll?

Upon reflection, I get that I was misguided. Commenting out a hidden
service wouldn't stop a DoS attack through your tor process. The fastest
way would be to configure all of the hidden services through a second
tor process, and wait for the directories to update. Then move them
back, one by one. The process could be scripted, but it would still take
a long time to do properly, given how long it takes the tor network to
respond to changes.
Maybe it would be better to run many tor instances, and put fewer hidden
services on each instance. That way, one black sheep wouldn't take down
everything. Also, segregating the tor processes and hidden services in
multiple VMs would be more secure, albeit heavier.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and solidarity against online harassment 
Yes. It seems that the NSA is aiming to compromise everything. So why
should Tor be exempt? But as others have noted, Tor software and the Tor
network are open to public inspection. Individual relays, of course, are
not. The NSA and other adversaries can easily participate.
However, Tor is by design a Chaum-style network of untrusted nodes. As
long as one of the three nodes in a circuit is honest, users remain
anonymous. Even simultaneous attacks by non-colluding adversaries can
protect users' anonymity. In order to avoid detection, malicious relays
tend to behave at least somewhat like honest ones. So as long as enough
attackers aren't colluding, they help protect users against each other.
That is very clever.
There are also VPN services and the JonDonym network. It's true that
they're not free, in a usable way. It's also true that they're less
anonymous, although JonDonym is arguably close. And of course, they
can't be trusted. However, they can readily be combined with Tor, in
order to further distribute trust among untrusted nodes.
Son las cosas de la vida ;)
Well, it depends on who you're hiding from, and whose honey-pot Tor
might be. But the focus here is the NSA. So, worst case, using Tor is
bad if you're hiding from the NSA. But really, only fools think that
simply using Tor is enough for hiding from the NSA. You need a
multi-layered approach. I write a lot about this.

Based on Snowden releases, this is SOP. And in any case, it's clear that
the NSA ignores civil law, given that the US is at war. Always. Forever.
We know from Snowden releases that they retain as much intercepted
traffic as they can, for as long as they can. There's recursive triage,
based on context, occurrence of keywords in metadata and content,
flagging by analysts, and so on. Over time, less-interesting content
gets decrufted and chunked, and eventually deleted. But metadata is
retained indefinitely.
For encrypted (aka enciphered) intercepts, there's no readily
interpretable content. So triage must be based primarily on metadata and
context. And it's arguable that encrypted intercepts of particular
interest (from Tor and other anonymity networks, VPN services, extremist
websites, and so on) are retained indefinitely.
Tor traffic among clients and relays is encrypted with perfect forward
secrecy, so retention is not a very serious threat. Each chunk of data
is encrypted with a different session key, and so is a separate puzzle.
Learning a particular Tor relay's private key does allow an adversary to
impersonate the relay. But it doesn't compromise prior traffic through
that relay.

Thanks for the correction. It was misleading to muddle Chaum and OR. I
was trying to make the point that participation by adversaries is part
of Tor's risk model, and isn't inherently fatal to anonymity. True?
I'm not sure that I understand this. I appreciate that malicious nodes,
exploiting design limitations and bugs, can deanonymize users. And I get
that having one honest node per circuit (no matter how honest and well
configured) doesn't prevent that. Is that it?
Yes, users get routed when an adversary owns both entry guard and exit,
or can intercept their traffic. Optimistically, that's a fixable design
limitation. Pessimistically, it's an inherent limitation of low-latency
anonymity networks.
But either way, none of this is evidence that Tor has been backdoored by
the US government. Your work is an excellent counterexample.
But I wonder which one. "That is very clever." doesn't add much. More
important is "So as long as enough attackers aren't colluding, they help
protect users against each other." Is that arguable? To me it seems a
key aspect of the design.

Upon reflection, I totally agree. And I apologize to Juan for being mean
and dismissive.
Indeed. In that regard, I am most troubled by the Tor browser.
Yes. I write a lot about such matters.
However, as Jonathan Wilkes noted yesterday, there's a risk of
frightening away users and potential relay operators. For better or
worse, Tor is the best low-latency anonymity network around. In the
short term at least, hurting Tor benefits many enemies of freedom.
There is no question that Tor was developed for the US military. And the
Tor Project is still funded largely (and for argument sake, entirely) by
the US government. But even so, I've seen no credible evidence that Tor
is backdoored or intentionally vulnerable.
It is true that Tor's threat model explicitly excludes global
adversaries, who can break anonymity by correlating entry and exit
traffic. It's also true that some proposed low-latency anonymity
networks may resist traffic analysis far better than Tor does. However,
these are highly technical matters, and there is much room for debate. I
am by no means qualified to have an opinion on the merits.
One might argue that the US government funding gives Tor an unwarranted
advantage, or even that it suppresses work on alternatives. As paranoid
as I am, that seems unworkable. But of course, I defer to evidence.

OK, thank you.
Well, the Tor Project can foster numerous honest entry guards and exits
that are fast enough to be widely used. But it can't reliably prevent
adversaries from intercepting traffic. Against adversaries with limited
network reach, users can pick inaccessible nodes. But that's unworkable
against global adversaries, so what's left is making them work harder.
I'm curious what that will look like :)
Sorry. No offense intended :)
Right. They won't get nuked as fast.
That's good news, I think. As long as there are at least two global

I trust as little as possible ;)
But hey, there was no reason to go there, and I apologize.
There's little doubt that Tor is the strongest low-latency anonymity
system around for general Internet browsing. Maybe, unfortunately,
that's not saying much. But I'm not a "fan". Tor is a tool, and a good
tool at that, but there are limitations.
I believe that it's prudent to hide Tor use behind nested VPN chains,
given that the NSA etc are logging all connections to it. I also
believe, for stronger anonymity, especially against global adversaries,
that it's prudent to tunnel VPNs and/or JonDonym through Tor.
I conclude that it doesn't matter ;)
Hey, thanks :)
Those are issues that all Tor users should be aware of. But the line
between healthy paranoia and FUD can get fuzzy. And FUD doesn't just
hurt Tor. It hurts people who need anonymity, and either end up using
something weaker, or using nothing at all, or are left with using Tor
that's been weakened by FUD.
Again, it's not the words that matter. It's the open code, the open
network, the freedom to investigate, probe and even attack. What matters
are observable facts, not just the words.
OK, so why would association with the US government matter, but for
backdoors and intentional weakness? Moral taint? That's arguably
irrelevant, considering the diversity of Tor's user base ;)
True. But first, we need to find stuff that needs denied. Actually, we
ought to just focus on getting bugs and design deficiencies fixed.
It's an old habit from academia ;)

Certainly, Tor helps the US and its allies to consolidate their power.
Why else would they fund it? But mostly it helps them to consolidate

But, longer term, what's important is that strong privacy and anonymity
will allow people to just say no to state power.

But have you read Johnson et al. (2013) Users Get Routed: Traffic

Yes, that too.
But I don't want my argument to depend on the good intentions of the US
government, because we have no way to demonstrate them to critics. Tor,
unless it is backdoored or intentionally vulnerable, benefits millions
of people in numerous ways. Even if we assume the worst about the US
government and its reasons for funding Tor, the code and network are
open to inspection. Unless and until such intentional defects are
identified, Tor is arguably a net benefit for freedom.
I was thinking of allegations that CIA etc agents have orchestrated
dissent in Iraq and Ukraine. If they were there, they probably used Tor,
unless the US government has something better. But I should have said
"...against the governments of Iraq and Russia...".

This arguably isn't about "whistleblowing". It's about eliminating a

radically, perhaps it's about undermining the "trust" (in practice,
often just compliance enforced by fear of consequences) that large
organizations depend on (and exploit). All hail Eris ;)

You can run the Tails ISO as a VM. But then there will be traces left on
the host machine, just as with Whonix.
Many ;)
All sorts of data (not just metadata) will remain from VirtualBox or
VMware running Tails or Whonix. I don't use Windows, but I've seen much
positive feedback about PrivaZer on
Even with the best cleaner, I wouldn't run VMs on Windows with any
expectation of privacy. Only a year or so ago, shellbags were not common
knowledge. Only the forensic community and hard-core black hat types
knew about them. It's arguable that many similar features in Windows
remain undocumented.
Getting a new public IP address from Tor helps a lot. You also get a new
MAC address for the VMs, and it's easy to permanently change a VM's MAC
address using the VirtualBox/VMware configuration GUI.
You also get a new browser signature. If you use multiple VMs, each can
have its own signature, which prevents association of activity among
them via fingerprinting.
No. If you're using Tails on a USB flash drive, there's an option for
persistent storage.
Data and metadata remain on Ubuntu by default. Given that Linux distros
are generally open source, it's feasible to identify all such remains,
and to remove them.
Even so, I find it far simpler to just use full disk encryption
(dm-crypt and LUKS) on my VM host machines.
I'm not sure what you're asking. The text that you quote concerns
traffic analysis. But you're asking about encryption. Unless your
connections to Internet sites are end-to-end encrypted, Tor exit relays
can see what you're downloading. But they don't know your ISP-assigned
IP address, and so can't determine who you are (unless you reveal that
by signing in with a traceable account, or whatever).
If by "encrypted" you mean "hidden", Tor does hide paths taken by
downloads, unless your apps aren't properly configured for Tor, and leak
your ISP-assigned IP address through UDP connections, for example.
They may see that you downloaded stuff, but they can't decrypt anything
that was protected by end-to-end encryption. You should always use
SSL/TLS (HTTPS etc) connections via Tor, for example. Connecting via Tor
with SSH or VPNs also provides end-to-end encryption. For messages,
always use GnuPG. For chat, use Pidgin with OTR.

According to ,
"arguable" means "open to argument, dispute, or question" and "that can
be plausibly or convincingly argued".
It's a word that I picked up working with lawyers. Basically, it means
that the proposition isn't clearly and obviously false, and that arguing
for it isn't obviously disingenuous. It's how plaintiffs typically
assert claims in complaints, when they don't yet have the necessary
evidence, some of which will be obtained in discovery.
The best evidence for undocumented privacy leaks in Windows is all of
the previously undocumented privacy leaks that are now documented. This
about sums it up: "Trick me once, shame on you. Trick me twice, shame on
me. Trick me three times and I get what I deserve!"

@_subject: [tor-talk] Terminology: Deep v Dark Web 
I've never liked the term "Dark Web". There's nothing dark about it,
except in the sense that Africa was called the "Dark Continent" because
it was little known in Europe. It was not especially dark there, until
the European invasion.
Virtually all of the "Dark Web" examples are networks that are routed
through the Internet. Most accurately, they are "Virtual Webs". Drawing
on Vernor Vinge, one could call them "High Webs", with the current
Internet being the "Deep Web".[1] If that's too evocative of The Silk
Road et alia, perhaps "Supra Web" would do.
Typical "Dark Web" examples are Tor and its hidden services, I2P and
Freenet. But there are many other private networks (government,
military, academic, enterprise, etc) that are routed via VPNs through
the Internet, and yet are not readily accessible from it. Whatever we
call this category, they belong in it too.
Analogous private networks, generally called anonets, are also routed
via VPNs through the Internet. Most of them use unallocated IP space.
Some of them route those addresses to the Internet, using customized DNS
services. And so they arguably become part of the Internet. This will
all become far easier with IPv6.
There are also physical networks that extend the Internet in various
ways. Some of them arguably become part of the Internet. But many,
including most meshnets, are rather too impromptu for that.

That is a very complicated question. See the thread on SSH, for example.
As long as Tor has been properly configured for DNS lookup, any app that
has a SOCKS5 option is probably safe. However, complex apps that use
multiple protocols in the background (such as BitTorrent) are not safe,
except perhaps for highly expert users. If in doubt, use Wireshark to
test for leaks. If you're in a hurry, your best bet is to use Whonix.

As long as you're using Tor browser or Tails, I doubt that the server is
seeing anything except a Tor exit IP.
Using HTTPS for the control panel is another important criterion.
I doubt that you'll find free web hosting that works with command line
tools. You won't get that until VPS hosting.
That's all too common :( There's less need for support that way. It's
really bad when they email you the new password whenever you change it.
Ultimately, you know that when it works, and it doesn't leak, no matter
how you try to break it. Sorry :(
Actually, the "properly configured" part is easy:
SocksPort 127.0.0.1:9050
DnsPort 127.0.0.1:53
The hard part is the iptables rules. I'll post something useful ASAP.
I agree. It's confusing.
You install Wireshark, and then capture on eth0. You should see no
non-local traffic except with your entry guards.
To install Wireshark, open a terminal and run these commands:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wireshark
To configure wireshark to allow a non-root user to sniff packets, run
these commands:
sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
sudo adduser $USER wireshark
I'm not sure that I understand that. USB support in VirtualBox does
require the extensions plug-in, and that's free but not "free" in a
purist sense. Is that it?
As long as you're not hiding Tor from your ISP, I don't see why you need
to download Whonix via Tails. And yet, Whonix is large. The Tor gateway
VM could be much smaller. I can point you to instructions for setting up
a pfSense VM as a Tor gateway, if you're interested.

Using "verbose tools" is only risky if those tools can see anything that
you don't want servers to see. At a minimum, Tor and those tools should
be running in an isolated system (at least a VM) that's never used for
anything that you want kept private. Better is to have the Tor client
and tools, apps, etc in separate VMs, as Whonix does.
For WiFi, just change the Wireshark captures from eth0 to whatever your
system's WiFi adapter is called.
That's partly my style. I include every instruction, assuming very
little knowledge. While it may seem complicated, it's actually very
simple. Just do each step, exactly as it's written.
Also, working with VMs is a great way to learn, because at worst you'll
be just trashing a VM. You can start by creating a basic VM, running
updates, installing tools, tweaking, etc. Then do actual work with
clones of that basic VM. Starting over after trashing a VM just takes a
few minutes.

Whether or not it's crucial depends on your adversaries. If your
adversaries include the NSA or Five Eyes, it's crucial. Otherwise,
especially if your adversaries are their adversaries, it likely doesn't
matter. And if your adversaries do include the NSA etc, you need a safer
way to get your bridges ;)
If you need bridges, one of your adversaries is your ISP, or whatever
controls it. As long as you're using HTTPS, that adversary will not even
see that you got bridges. The NSA etc may know via XKeyScore, or
whatever the latest iteration is called. But that only matters if they
are working with your ISP-related adversary.
Even if you do need an "anonymous email address", that doesn't rule out
Gmail or Yahoo. You can create an account via public WiFi, and use

protect against MAC tracking, you can use a USB WiFi adapter. That way,

(2011)[2]. For example, I see nothing about that in ticket 7520[3].
Has the DNS-based fast flux approach been explicitly rejected?
If so, why?
As background, McCoy and coworkers explain[2]:
Even so, Proximax is vulnerable to adversaries who register multiple
users, and then block bridge IP addresses that they learn, perhaps at
plausibly gradual rates. Starzer[4] proposes a defense against such
adversaries. In his version, each bridge domain name is assigned to a
group of users. Group reputation increases over time, and
high-reputation groups preferentially get both new bridge IP addresses
and new members. Groups are split whenever one of their bridges is
blocked, and the reputations of both subgroups are reduced. Over time,
an adversary's users become restricted to increasingly smaller groups
with increasingly poor reputations.

Starzer's masters thesis.

I'm very intrigued by possibilities of multiple hidden services with
fast HS-HS links via Tor. One use case would be the standard
front-end/back-end website design. Another would be "smart"
load-balancing proxies, which could detect and foil attacks such as
DDoS, localization, and so on. Another would be full anonet-style
darknets, using OnionCat or OpenVPN via Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What are use cases made unpleasant by Tor's speed? 
One use case would defend against Biryukov et al. (2013) Trawling for
Tor Hidden Services. For example, the public hidden service for a
discussion forum would be a dumb front end, running in Tor-ramdisk. Peer
address and authentication, user authentication, content and so on would
be in other hidden services, with encrypted descriptors.
While the front end might be localized, nothing would be compromised or
lost. Back end hidden services could be protected by disposable reverse
proxies, which would evaporate if the front end were compromised. In
recovery, the hardest part would be advertising the new address.
Indeed, the public hidden service could be a "smart" load-balancing
proxy, which could detect and foil DDoS and traffic-correlation attacks.
For example, client conversations could be transferred to, and switched
among, multiple synchronized (even clustered) front ends.
Another use case would be collaborative darknets comprising numerous
linked yet anonymous hidden services. Using OnionCat or OpenVPN via Tor
circuits, they would behave just like normal IPv4/IPv6 networks.
No, it doesn't. Even though there might be many hidden services under my
control, they would all be carefully anonymized, from me and from each
other. They would be associated only by the links among them. And so
it's important for those links to be as anonymous as possible.

Discussions of measured entropy and stuff are too abstract for me. Maybe

toggled NoScript to block by default, and that I have a unique pattern
of enabling particular scripts on particular sites. That is, I'm unique
among all Tor users. In what ways does that put my Tor use at risk of
being linked to IP addresses seen by my entry guards?
Am I at risk because relay adversaries can more easily find me in their
sets of compromised circuits? If I were totally indistinguishable from
other Tor users, would finding me be millions of times harder? Or maybe
1e+9 to 1e+12 fold harder? What's the appropriate expression for that?

But yes, such users need maximal uncertainty.

I don't get that EFF's Panopticlick entropy and uniqueness estimates are
relevant to discussing Tor anonymity.
With the latest Tor browser in a Crunchbang 11 x64 VirtualBox VM without
guest extensions (rather unusual right there) I get 11.29 bits (one in
2,505) with default NoScript "Allow Scripts Globally". That's very close
to Ben's 12.06 bits (one in 4,260).
With NoScript toggled to "Forbid Scripts Globally", I get exactly what
Ben got: 9.05 bits (one in 529). And by the way, that's not the sum of
the individual browser characteristic results. As Joe notes, they're
mostly 1.75 bits, because Panopticlick can't determine them. And the
overall estimate seems to largely ignore them.
the same fingerprint from all Tor browsers that have NoScript blocking
all scripts. The "one in 529" arguably reflects the share of visitors
who are using Tor browser. It says nothing about differences between Tor
With scripts allowed globally, Panopticlick sees another 2-3 bits. I
suspect that much of the additional information is also the same for all
Tor browsers, given what I've read about Tor-specific tweaks. If that's
the case, this isn't a major issue.
What is a major issue is the risk of being exploited through a
JavaScript vulnerability. And that's why I always block scripts.
The risk from doing that, of course, is that each user will tend to
customize their NoScript profile in a distinct way. And that will allow
websites to tell them apart.
Even so, Panopticlick can't report anything about that. For that, one
would need a version of Panopticlick that's restricted to assessing and
comparing Tor browser profiles. Right?

Upon reflection, it should be NOW=`date +%F_%H-%M-%S`.
Links2 doesn't write the file until it's been fully loaded. So the time
required to load equals the difference between the "dump Craigslist URL

Maybe it's not that hard. It seems that executing exit_used.py[1] right
after each CL dump test would report the exit used. And that could be
piped to a timestamped file. Grabbing URLs, exit IPs and timestamps from
output files would be trivial.
Also, for image-heavy URLs, Midori might be a better choice, because it
dumps to PNGs.

I have a crude hack that periodically determines loading times for
various URLs, while logging exits used with the Stem exit_used.py
script. It uses "torsocks midori -s  to get PNG
snapshots, and "host foo.com" to get IPs to reference exit_used.py output.
I'm seeing loading times for some CL URLs as great as five minutes.
However, I'm using Tor through a VPN chain, and latency may be at fault.
Once I'm satisfied that the setup is stable, I'll create some testing
VMs on a hosted server.

I've looked at four CL sites:
I did three test sets for the four sites, and each set ended up using
the same exit. For all three exits (PrivacyRepublic0010, Chandler18 and
marcuse2) I saw loading times of about six minutes.
In the course of each test set, I saw connections through the initial
exit to 100-130 other CL sites. I also saw numerous connections to other
CL sites through many other exits.
I don't know how to interpret that. Any ideas?

Cool. What URLs have you been looking at -- root URLs or particular ads,
posts, etc?
You're testing all known exits, right? And they're ranked in the plot by
loading time, right? But in that case, I don't understand the zero
weights in the center.
I'm guessing that Tor clients don't pick at least some of the
non-responding ones. I'd also like a cite to the selection algorithm.
Also, how are you measuring load times? Are you getting full pages with
images etc, or just the HTML?
I'd appreciate more explanation of this observation.

balancing methods are slowing down access via Tor, but not intentionally.

Here's what I get for craigslist from my first test series. As noted, I
get information about Tor exit used using exit_used.py[1] and loading
times with "torsocks midori -s  I got blacklist
information for the exits from MXToolBox[2].
For three of the ten exits used (default client choices) in the first
test series,  loaded in about eight seconds (30-50
Kbps). For the other seven, it took several minutes (~1 Kbps).
I don't see any obvious correlation with blacklist status.

Yes, I'm letting Tor pick. I want to get results that are directly
relevant for actual users. There will still be some artifacts due to
console-based snapshotting, however. And yes, I'll be running this for a
while, and perhaps multiple VMs in parallel. So far, I'm collecting data
for the top 50 websites. I will look at behavior over time.
As I understand it, you're just getting the HTML. I'm getting the entire
page, or at least whatever Midori grabs while pretending to be Firefox.
For example, I get  with numerous (X-rated) images ;)
Also, I was hitting sites at 1-2 minute intervals, and successive hits
sometimes used the same exit (and perhaps the same circuit). Excluding
craigslist, the greatest loading time was about 500 seconds. So perhaps
I was overlapping too much at times. I've increased sleep between site
loads to 8-12 minutes, and decreased sleep between 50-site runs from
30-60 minutes to 20-40 minutes. That may reduce page-size variance.
There's also wkhtmltopdf. Maybe it does a better job, being lighter even
than Midori. But I worry that it also may look less like a browser than
command-line Midori.
Once I work out kinks, and collect enough data, I'll write this up
somewhere with results for all 50 top sites.

I totally agree, there's no reason to defy anything, unless creating a

The law is the law, and (acting openly) the choices are compliance, or
noncompliance on principle. But see above.
Exemptions for victims and freedom fighters from designations as "State
Sponsor of Terrorism" would make sense. After all, the US has itself
supported freedom fighters in Iran, during the 2009-2010 election.
As long as funding doesn't come with strings, there's no problem with
accepting it.
As I see this case, the prospective donor was foolish to contact the Tor
Project directly, apparently with no effective anonymity. And whoever
publicized this screwup was also foolish. After explaining the situation
to said prospective donor, the Tor Project should have discretely
mentioned the donor's intent and contact information through suitable
channels. And then they should have forgotten about it all.

Yes, laws may change after people stand up against them. But sometimes
they don't. We still have huge taxes on whiskey, for example ;)
But that's what I said above. People can comply, or stand up and refuse
to comply.
Well, first they refused to comply. Some of them did so flagrantly, in
order to precipitate a crisis. Then they waited for King George's
decision. It was only after he decided against the colonists, and sent
more troops, that serious fighting started.
The fight for desegregation in the US was explicitly modeled on Gandhi's
non-violent resistance strategy that led to independence for India. I
don't think that "militants" is accurate for them. It was
segregationists who were violent.
But I do entirely agree that they were revolutionaries :)
Actually, punishment by oppressors (being beaten or even martyred, going
to jail, etc) is typically part of the process.
Well, I do appreciate that this is not part of the Tor Project's
mission. However, they do provide the means (Tor) for handling such
donations discretely ;)
Let me rephrase that. If it's OK for the Tor Project to be heavily
funded by the US government, it should be OK to accept donations from
some liberal in Iran.
They really ought to become an explicitly global organization. Having
their foot nailed to the floor in the US is ridiculous.

What exactly do you mean by that? It's true that any Tor user can host a

vulnerable than Tor users, simply because they serve stuff.
Police are still leveraging the Freedom Hosting bust, I think. It takes

defendants become informants, as Monsegur (Sabu) did re LulzSec. And
informants sometimes operate for many years.

That's an obvious chicken/egg problem, especially for exits. Even with

Most Tor users are seeking privacy and anonymity, so having their IP
listed as a Tor exit is counterintuitive. There are idealists, of
course. But I can't imagine how ~7% of Internet users would be that
But maybe there's a solution involving IPv6, cloud services and
Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies. With growth and competition in cloud
services, the Tor cloud could start including exit bridges as well as
entry bridges. With IPv6 addressing, bridges could change their IPs
rapidly enough to avoid both entry and exit blocks.
Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies could provide a mechanism for at least
some users to anonymously fund the Tor cloud. Also, by incorporating
automatic receipts in the payment system, embedded encrypted messages
could update bridge users with addresses of forthcoming bridges. Doing
that securely for exit bridges would be harder, but not impossible.

Tor IPs, it might freeze my account. And that's a _good_ thing.
That's why anonabox is so dangerous, even if there were no security

You can't reliably block by IP address. It's unfair, because numerous

(or even all known proxies) only stops the clueless. Anyone serious
about evading a block could just use a private proxy on AWS (via Tor).
Even imposing a nontrivial cost for creating accounts (say 10 BTC) would
not help. Determined adversaries would pay it. And of course, that would
exclude numerous innocents who wouldn't or couldn't pay.
That would exclude numerous users living under repressive regimes. But

user needs to generate. Generating the key would require arbitrarily
great effort, but would impose negligible cost on Wikimedia or users
during subsequent use. Although there's nothing special about such GnuPG
keys as proof of work, they're more generally useful.

There's another possibility that's probably easier to implement and
test, but isn't so broadly useful as a hard-to-generate GnuPG key. In
creating a hidden service, the Tor client generates an RSA private_key
and uses the first 80 bytes of the key's SHA1 hash as the hostname.
Vanity hostnames being popular, there are published methods.[0]

I'm suggesting that you require new accounts to generate a functional
GnuPG key (with normal key length etc) with a fingerprint (hash) that
begins with a random string supplied by Wikimedia. Although there are
shortcuts for creating keys with arbitrary fingerprints, they produce
keys with atypical key lengths etc. In order to produce a "normal" key
with the specified fingerprint substring, it would be necessary to
randomly generate numerous keys and select for the desired fingerprint.
Having accomplished that, the new user could edit the metadata to match
their account name and email address.
It just so happens, given the popularity of vanity Tor hidden-service
names, that there are apps that generate and select private keys in that
way. It's merely an example of the approach, which demonstrates its
feasibility. I suspect that creating a version for GnuPG keys would
require trivial modifications.
I'll ask about this on gnupg-users and report.

Tor is barely ten years old. Uptake has been most rapid, for obvious
reasons, among ideologues and those who need privacy. And there's no
question at some of them need privacy in order to enable and/or hide
various sorts of illegitimate (i.e., non-defensive) aggression.
But the point isn't to debate the merits of various uses. As more and
more people use Tor, the user population will more and more look like
the overall population. The current situation is clearly just a
temporary phase. But it's a vulnerable phase, because adversaries are
misusing the evidence as FUD, seeking to limit Tor's growth.

Tor is vulnerable to two general sorts of attacks. One involves the use
of malicious relays in various ways to deanonymize circuits. The other
involves the use of traffic analysis to correlate traffic captured at
edges of the Tor network (to users and the websites that they access).
With ISPs, there's the risk that some organization can monitor traffic
on both ends. It's common to characterize such organizations as "global
passive adversaries". However, a single ISP (or a firm owning multiple
ISPs) could do that, if it provides service to both users and websites.
Also, users who access websites in their own nation via Tor are
similarly vulnerable to their government.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How FBI Pinpointed Silk Road's Server 
If the server is properly configured for securely hosting a hidden
service, what you say is true. But that apparently wasn't the case here,
no matter what tools FBI agents may have used.
If the webserver and tor process are running on the same machine, the
webserver might serve on 127.0.0:8080. The tor process would listen on
that address:port, and might forward to myonionaddressis.onion:80.
An SSH port is also necessary, and that must also be configured as a
hidden service. It's best to use a separate onion address, and not just
a different port (say port 2020 forwarded to 22). The same approach
should have been used for any other apps needing remote access.
The server's firewall would block all incoming, forwarding and outgoing
traffic by default, and allow outgoing traffic only by the tor process
(identified by userid). That userid would be running nothing else except
tor. That way, neither the webserver nor sshd etc could reach the
Internet, except through Tor.
However, if the server's firewall wasn't properly configured, direct
outgoing connections (bypassing Tor) might have been permitted by sshd,
webserver, php, mysql and/or some other app. That's a big fail.
Also, for a hidden service like Silk Road, it would have been prudent
(extremely so) to segregate all server apps and the tor process on
separate machines (or at least, on separate VMs). Separating webserver
and backend databases on separate machines would also have been wise.
That would have provided redundant protection against misconfiguration
and/or compromise.
Firewalls on both webserver and tor process machines would block
everything by default except for two sorts of connections. Connections
would be allowed between server apps and the tor process, and between
the tor process and the Internet. In both cases, connections would be
locked down by userid and address:port to prevent leaks outside Tor.

my remote servers through nested chains of at least three VPN services.

It quite obviously does, I believe. Given the current uptake status, I
mean. Of course, if everyone used it for everything, as the Tor Project
would like, using Tor would not stand out. And the Tor network would be
much larger, and would provide much stronger anonymity.
That's why I access the Tor network via VPNs.
tl;dr: Tor's many capable and resourceful adversaries stymie each other.
Well, everything encrypted (beyond HTTPS) gets forwarded to the NSA and
counterparts, and is retained indefinitely, pending key discovery or
advances in decryption capabilities. Also for testing and play :) And
that obviously includes all Tor traffic, I believe.
It's also highly likely that the NSA and counterparts operate Tor nodes,
obviously including entry guards and exits. However, as capable and
resourceful as the NSA and Five Eyes are, there are other major TLAs
(e.g., China, Israel and Russia) and non-state actors (e.g., the Yakuza
and the Triads, and their associates). And then there are the
cypherpunks and other "good guys" :) And small-time criminals :(
To the extent that such non-cooperating groups are competing to operate
nodes, it's arguable that no one group can control enough of the Tor
network to pwn it. That's the plan, anyway :)

I agree with "a". It would be sad if "b" is true, but OK, let's assume
it. Then I agree that "relying on a VPN as your exit is a bad idea for
anyone with a FBI/CIA level opponent". Unless you have a clue, anyway.
However, this is _exactly the opposite_ of how Grugq's advice was
presented in the Privacy PC article that was cited in this thread:[0]
That is incoherent. Think about it. Certainly a "VPN is simply a link
from the end point to yourself" when you use the VPN alone, without Tor.
That's also the case when you connect to a VPN through Tor, if the VPN
provider knows who you are, by money trail or whatever.
But if you connect to Tor through a VPN, endpoints will see Tor exits.
They will not see the VPN. That's a key feature of Tor, after all.
Unless Tor has been hosed, only entry guards will see the VPN.
And it's not an error in the Privacy PC article. In Grugq's 2012 Hack In
The Box presentation "OPSEC: Because Jail is for wuftpd" at 46:25, which
has also been cited in this thread, we see:[1]
Seriously, WTF? Are we not speaking the same language? Have I
misunderstood the distinction between "to" and "through"?

Let's go for it. I already have a VPS setup for testing the VPN aspect.
I gather that I'd need to setup a private entry guard. As I recall from
the literature, that's doable, but I don't recall precisely how. For the
rest, I can use the public Tor network, right?
I also have a test website that loads a complex, asymmetric page.
As I noted recently, my traffic correlation skills are primitive. I've
never managed more than 4:1 signal to noise, using my simple-minded dot
product approach. Although I understand some of the fancy
signal-analysis math, I'm not aware of open-source software to implement
it efficiently. It would be sweet if someone would provide some guidance.

@_subject: [tor-talk] WebRTC to uncover local IP 
This means that people need to be using gateways (VMs or hardware) for
accessing Tor, VPNs, JonDonym or whatever. There must be _no_ path to
the Internet except through the anonymity system. There must also be no
path to anything sensitive on local networks. For Tor, that means
something like Whonix, the equivalent in Qubes, or a pfSense Tor
gateway. Just sayin'.

@_date: 2015-01-30 03:55:12
@_author: Mirimir 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor -> VPN  Clarification 
That's "VPN -> Tor". Your Tor client reaches the entry guard through the
VPN provider's exit server.
There is none ;)
Yes. That uses the --socks-proxy option in OpenVPN.[0]
It's one way to access websites that reject connections from Tor exits.
Many VPN IPs are also blocked, but many aren't. More generally, websites
won't see that you're using Tor, which may be desirable. But a key
disadvantage is that the VPN connection prevents Tor from switching
circuits. So overall, there's probably less anonymity.
In order for this to be at all useful, there must be no observable
association between you and the VPN provider. You must pay for the VPN
with cash by mail, or via Tor with Bitcoins that have been _thoroughly_
anonymized via Tor. And you must never connect the VPN except through
Tor. Bottom line, you must never screw up!
There's also VPN -> Tor -> VPN. You can even add JonDonym to the mix.

Yes, he does. But I don't get why. Maybe someone can explain.
How is letting ones ISP see connections to Tor entry guards safer than
only letting the VPN provider see them? Ones ISP is typically at mercy
of ones government, and perhaps even local criminals. Conversely, ones
VPN provider is (if prudently chosen) not at mercy of such local
adversaries. At worst, from a "go to jail" perspective, the VPN provider
is cooperating with ones ISP and local adversaries. Right?
And anyway, VPN1 -> VPN2 -> VPN3 -> Tor is better.

With TBB, the SocksPort is 127.0.0.1:9150. So in order to route the VPN

That is a concern. And although they've arguably addressed it through
diversification in multiple jurisdictions, they're upfront about
focusing on business-class pseudonymity.
In anonymity space, they are far closer to VPNs than to Tor, I think.
Also, their mixes are fixed. So as with VPNs, there's a one-to-one
mapping of entry and exit IPs. Furthermore, their userbase is much
smaller than for Tor and popular VPN services.

How is that any worse than adversaries correlating traffic between your

Tor is by definition vulnerable to such adversaries.
I've been thinking about testing such matters. What's the best
open-source software for traffic correlation? I've read just about all
of the relevant stuff on Free Haven, and haven't seen anything that's

The simple approach worked, presumably because nothing in Tor Browser
except Firefox (and Tor, which I remove) is architecture-dependent. But
a little tweaking was required. I installed tor-browser_en-US from
tor-browser-linux32-4.5a4_en-US.tar.xz, and overwrote the Firefox folder
from the build. Because Tor is running on a gateway Pi, I also deleted
the Tor folder.
In order to have Tor Browser run without local tor process, I added two
lines to prefs.js in the profiles:
Once Tor Browser would run, I changed SocksPort to 192.168.2.1:9150 and
disabled the TorLauncher extension. All expected extensions are present.
Also,  reports that that the browser is
using Tor, and doesn't complain that it's not Tor Browser. All that's
left, I think, is to configure ControlPort 192.168.2.1:9051 and make
Torbutton happy.
I'll also look at the deterministic builds approach using Raspuntu.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and iptables. 
You asked "What is my problem? Why I can't use "obfs4" ?"
The problem, I think, is that you reject everything ...
-A OUTPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
... before allowing Tor traffic. So Tor can't connect.
Unless you run Tor as a specific user, there's no elegant way to
restrict output. You could have a rule allowing output to directory
servers and your bridges. Beyond authorities, I'm not sure how many
directory servers you'd need. Maybe some kind person can provide a
minimal list of directory server IPs.
Also, there's no need to allow any input, except loopback and
related/established. Because Tor is handling everything. So with Tor
running as user, just use this:
:INPUT DROP [0:0]
:FORWARD DROP [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT  to SSH in
-A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -j DROP
-A FORWARD -j DROP
If you want to add output rules for Tor servers, and block all other
output (which is good to prevent leaks):
:INPUT DROP [0:0]
:FORWARD DROP [0:0]
:OUTPUT DROP [0:0]
-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT  to SSH in
-A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -j DROP
-A FORWARD -j DROP
-A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
-A OUTPUT -d w.x.y.z -j ACCEPT  for all needed servers
-A OUTPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A OUTPUT -j DROP
And if you run Tor with a special user with uid foo:
:INPUT DROP [0:0]
:FORWARD DROP [0:0]
:OUTPUT DROP [0:0]
-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT  to SSH in
-A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -j DROP

Well, the key should be backed up, so we can ignore this issue.
If the key has been stolen, an adversary could use it to spoof the site.
If both the real site and spoofed site are up, users will generally
reach the one where the tor process has restarted most recently. And if
the site owner generates a new hostname, the real site looks like a spoof.
But GnuPG signing resolves the issue. The private GnuPG key never leaves

I agree that HSDirs are the places to handle this. The network already
trusts them not to MitM connections, and send users to malicious HS,
right? And I presume that there is testing for dishonest HSDirs. If not,
there should be.
It would be safest, I think, to simply delete HS descriptors upon
receipt of a valid revocation message, signed by the private key. As
long as operators backup private keys, they can always revoke them. It's
true that adversaries could revoke HS descriptors after stealing private
keys. However, having the site unreachable is arguably the safest
outcome after key compromise.
Private HS keys are often vulnerable, virtually unprotected in remote
hosts. So it's risky to rely on them alone for verifying revocation
messages. However, one could add the option of supplying public GnuPG
keys to HSDirs, signed by HS keys. There could be a time limit on that,
so that it won't become an attack vector. Then HSDirs would require
revocation messages signed by both private HS and GnuPG keys.
It would also be necessary to propagate signed revocation messages among
HSDirs. Each HSDir would check signatures. There's still the risk that
malicious HSDirs would ignore revocation messages. That would require
checking by peers.

target users. And it's arguable that most of Tor's target users are not
being targeted by global adversaries. Or at least, in the cynical sense
that enemies of the US are also not not among Tor's target users. But
I'm not going to make that argument. Rather, I'm willing to accept the
assertion that resisting global adversaries is just too bloody hard.
So anyway, would it be too much to expect the Tor Project to explicitly
state, on the front page, that users shouldn't count on Tor if they are
concerned about adversaries with global reach? Such as the NSA?
If you look at the news about pwned Tor users, it's pretty clear that
most (if not all) were using Tor browser in Windows. NIT is Windows
malware. There have been Firefox bugs, but they've been exploited
through code that only runs on Windows. Or am I missing something?
Another issue is that these user exploits all relied on accessing the
Internet directly, rather than through Tor. Right? Anyone who actually
cares about [anonymity | unlinkability | deniability | privacy] should
be segregating networking from the browser and other apps. Whonix is an
easy way to do that. VirtualBox works well in Windows.

Better is doing this with VMs as gateways for VPNs and Tor. Because

You obviously don't want to use a VPN service paid for through a

Yes, this is a dumb idea, on so many levels.
Well, those (Tor through VPN, and VPN through Tor) are different
situations, with different implications. If you're hitting Tor through
VPNs, you might have an entry guard and VPN server using the same VPS
host. But that would just short out the VPN.
But instead, you might be unlucky enough to have a VPN server and exit
relay using the same VPS host. Tor wouldn't catch that, in the way it
does for relays. However, you might instead be unlucky enough to have an
entry guard and honeypot website using the same VPS host. I'm not
convinced that either of those risks is hugely greater than the other.
If you route a VPN through Tor, you prevent circuit switching, and
that's clearly bad. And you would be hosed with an entry guard and VPN
server using the same VPS host. But again, I'm not convinced that this
is a hugely greater risk than having an entry guard and honeypot website

that relays and VPN servers aren't using the same VPS hosts.

So this has been happening for at least three years. It's very likely
that Whonix isn't vulnerable, because browser and tor process are
isolated in separate VMs. And I've seen nothing about Whonix users
being pwned.
Why hasn't Tor Project recommended Whonix for those who need better
security than Tor browser can offer?

There is an aspect of visiting hostile onion sites that's especially
problematic: forcing direct clearnet connections that reveal users'
ISP-assigned IP addresses. It's irresponsible to continue recommending
only vulnerable setups, especially Tor browser in Windows.

The CMU team did exploit the relay early bug. But there haven't been
many tor bugs as serious as that.
Sure, browser exploits are common. And yes, Freedom Hosting and
PlayPen users got pwned through Firefox bugs. However, the FBI malware
that deanonymized them exploited a trivial vulnerability in all
default Tor installs: there is no management of Internet traffic that
bypasses the Tor network.
Making Tor browser available without warning about leaks is just plain
irresponsible. About five years ago, Metasploit hosted the NIT used in
the Freedom Hosting attack, as a test for proxy leaks. It was easy to
pass, using firewall rules and/or VM compartmentalization.
One could argue that anyone using Tor for critical stuff should know
that. But obviously, many of them don't. We hear about the ones that
the FBI takes down. But what about the ones who just get killed?
Is it too much to ask for a warning? Maybe a link to Whonix?

I never said that Tor browser was designed to be vulnerable. But it

very little on the Tor Project site about how to prevent leaks, and
nothing about Whonix.
I'm hardly asking for perfection. Just a little heads up for the sheep.

That sounds good to me. Except that there's nothing on the Tor Project
site about Whonix, and virtually nothing about proxy-bypass leaks.
I'm not arguing that all Tor users should use Whonix. I'm arguing that
the Tor Project ought to mention that as an option.
1) Specify how much ones time is worth: X USD/hr.
2) Estimate pwnage cost (lost income, legal fees, prison, etc): Y USD.
3) Divide Y by X to get time investment justified to avoid pwnage.
Anyway, what does Tor Project gain by not mentioning Whonix?

Giving clueless folk an illusion of safety is arguably bad.
What about ?
Tor Project has made a huge deal over the PlayPen pwnage. Demanding
that the FBI release information about its NIT. But they can't be
bothered to actually explain how users could have been protected?
It's not just "one particular direction". It's the vulnerability
that's arguably compromised the most people. Or maybe second only to
the relay early exploit, which they did patch eventually.
Tails is on  but
not Whonix. Why is that?
Sure. Except that proxy bypass has been a major fail. Do you disagree?
Because I'm a anarchocapitalist ;)
Make it qualitative, if you like.
It's not complex.
If there are no substantive risks, use Tor browser. If being pwned
will be a life-changing event, at least use Whonix.
My point is that a few days of study and work is justified for anyone
who faces substantive consequences from compromise.

Well, say "technically inexperienced" if you like. In my world, we
call that "clueless". I'm more or less clueless in many areas, and am
not ashamed to admit it.
Well, given what we know of TLA capabilities, what Tor Project says at
 is tantamount to false advertising:
Maybe so against local adversaries. But clearly not against global
adversaries. Cynical folk note that so far, the US and its allies are
the only known global adversary. And claim that this is self-serving
It for sure hasn't stopped FBI, with their honeypots that drop
malware. And I doubt that it stops NSA/GCHQ. But Tor Project just
postures about "bad FBI". They don't give naive users, who may be at
risk, even a brief heads up about proxy leakage, and how to prevent it.
Two or three years ago, even after the Freedom Hosting debacle, I was
willing to cut Tor Project some slack. But after the PlayPen attack,
it's becoming harder to escape the conclusion that Tor Project either
doesn't want to mitigate this risk, or doesn't have the contractual
freedom to do so.
Fair enough :)
It's my general impression that Whonix project has been actively
rebuffed. But I have no inside knowledge.
Yes, that does seem to be the case. But asking hasn't gotten me
anywhere. Maybe some fly on the wall will dump some evidence ;)
I don't disagree that they're different issues. My point is that
warning users about proxy bypass takes but a few words on a website,
and maybe a link. And given that it's such an easy fix, I suspect that
Tor Project either doesn't want to admit the risk so clearly, or is
somehow being prevented from doing so.
It's been at least five years! The relay early bug got fixed in
months. Maybe devs are working on some integrated firewall or
whatever. That would be cool. But Whonix isn't vulnerable, has been
available for years, and gets no love. And it's not just Whonix. Other
approaches that separate tor process and userland have also been
largely ignored.
Which VPNs have received NSLs?
Anyway, I don't assume that a particular VPN operator can be trusted
any more than a particular Tor relay operator can. Just as Tor uses
three-relay circuits, I recommend using nested VPN chains, with at
least three different VPNs, operating in different jurisdictions.

I'd say "meta" rather than "sideways", but hey ;)
Well, Whonix uses stock Tor browser, with a tweak to keep it from
launching its own local tor process. It also enforces stream
separation for other apps. But the key thing here is that it prevents
proxy bypass.
Yes, they are for sure not that line. So why not acknowledge that?
Maybe key funders have said no to that.
Right. For most, Tor browser on Windows. Pwnage waiting to happen.
But why does Tor Project care about captured audience dependency?
People using Whonix, like people using Tails, are still using Tor. And
still using stock Tor browser.
Maybe goals of key funders are driving this. Deliver lots of Tor
relays and users to hide our agents. But make sure that users can't
hide from our TLAs. That's what language in Graham's appropriations
bill says. Maybe that's been the backroom deal for years, and Tor
Project has been pushing back. One does get that sense from the leaked
IRC logs.

I'll take a closer look at the clients. In many cases, it was just
stock OpenVPN, or maybe with a wrapper.
Good point. I'll tweak that language.
Yes, it's why doing your own leak prevention is best. Unless the VPN
provides its own IPv6 address, disable IPv6 everywhere you can, and
block it with firewall rules. Use firewall rules to allow connections
on physical interface only to VPN server. Restrict everything else to
VPN tunnel. And make sure that you're using VPN-assigned DNS server(s)
through VPN tunnel.
But the six totally leak-free Windows VPN clients do that. Indeed,
FrootVPN and Perfect Privacy provide their own IPv6 addresses. And
FrootVPN is leak-free using stock OpenVPN, doing just server-side.
Interesting. VPN SOCKS5 port.

OpenVPN Onion VPS for Evading Discrimination Against Tor
Basically, it's a VPN service that's reachable _only_ as an onion
service. So no exit nodes get wasted. But there's no crowding unless you
share the .onion with others. And once jerks are using it, it will get
blacklisted, and the VPS may be taken down. So it goes.
I must emphasize that this is _only_ safe if you lease the VPS as
anonymously as you need to be for the sites that you'll be browsing. You
do everything through Tor. You provide fake contact information, use a
fresh email address, and pay with well-mixed Bitcoin. Mix at least
twice, among independent wallets in different Whonix instances, using
different mixing services. And check for taint at each stage.

It doesn't look good. James Anslow has noted: "Isn't there merit to
the idea of moving as much over tor as possible so as to work towards
dispelling the myth of tor as a network that only transmits
questionable traffic?" That seems unlikely. Maybe media torrents and
streaming will migrate to Tor onion services, driven by increasing
difficulty of hiding in the clearnet, especially as we move to IPv6.
But that won't affect Tor exit traffic. And, as hard as Tor Project
beats its drum, I doubt that there will mass uptake. If for no other
reason, discrimination against Tor users breaks too many sites. So who
would bother, unless they have some strong motivation?
There's also a great thread in tor-relays about a recent request from
a hosting provider for a Tor exit to block malicious traffic with IPS:
There are similar discussions among users of VPN services. Netflix and
other streaming sites are getting better and better at blocking VPN
users. Forums and blogs are getting better and better at blocking
comment spammers who use VPN services. Ditto for market research and
other legitimate business purposes. Bottom line, it's easy to create
lists of VPN exit IPs, and those IPs generally belong to data centers.
DDoS operations all use botnets. Some proxy services do as well. And
then there are "voluntary botnets" like Hola/Luminati. Hola is a
"free" VPN service, that routes users' traffic through other users'
uplinks. The Luminati "Business Proxy Network" sells access to
millions of Hola users' uplinks for $250 to $6000 or more per month,
depending on IP type and traffic limits. I gather that there are other
such proxy networks. Some may also leech off free VPN services. Some
may be driven by other malware, more like traditional botnets. Maybe
some rely on fraudulently obtaining residential ISP services.
Any of that could be grafted to Tor. Maybe not for exit relays,
because they would arguably get banned for malicious behavior. But
there are other ways out of the Tor network. Basically, an onion
service can serve as a clearnet gateway. For example, see my guide for
using an OpenVPN onion VPS to evade discrimination against Tor:
More generally, onion VPS can be linked via OnionCat, and some of them
can serve as disposable VPN exits. There's also the possibility of
routing traffic through I2P, just to add some confusion. For example,
see But of course, those exits all have data-center IPs. However, if
discrimination against Tor and data-center IPs becomes intense enough,
that will create a niche for anonymity services that route traffic
through residential uplinks. Rent-seeking means that it's criminals
who will exploit that first. Maybe they already are.
And so it's worse than a Catch 22 about increasing Tor use in the face
of blanket discrimination. As users -- and most importantly, criminals

Hash: SHA1
Let's say that I'm working on some project, and I'm getting errors
that I don't understand. So I'd like to search using Google. Because
it's the best. But I'm working in Whonix, so Google won't serve me. I
pass a CAPTCHA, and submit my search request. But then I get "403.
That's an error. Your client does not have permission to get URL ...
from this server. That's all we know." Sure, I could get Google
results via StartPage. But then I don't get some useful Google search
tweaking features. So fuck it, I just hit Google through a throwaway VPS
Now instead, Google could let me complete the search. And browse some
results. And come back to the search window with revised searches.
Given that this is all to help me with a particular problem, I don't
care that all of the searches are linked. It doesn't bother me that
Google sets a session cookie, to let me page through results and back,
and remember that I'm not an asshole. There is the issue that Tor
browser will drop cookies if my exit IP changes, but that's normally
not a serious issue.
Of course, Google is logging all sorts of other stuff about my
session, or at least trying to. And Tor browser is preventing as much
of that as it can. So I suspect that Google demands more from users
than the ability to set session cookies, to track short-term that a
user is not being an asshole. But the question, I think, is whether
any of that other stuff is actually necessary for preventing abuse. I
doubt it.
Let's say that I'm logging into my Wilders account via Tor. That works
just fine. What doesn't work is creating new Wilders accounts via Tor.
They don't allow that, because otherwise there's too much forum spam
to manage. So whatever, you can create new accounts through a Tor plus
a proxy. But the key issue is that Wilders aggressively manages
accounts for abuse. Moderators redact and delete offending posts. From
what I hear, repeat abusers may get a warning. But mostly their
accounts just stop working, or become read-only. As a long-time
Wilders user, I get lots of "Wilders nuked my account :(" messages ;)
So if a little site like Wilders can manage that, why not any forum?
And with a little extra effort, they could even allow account creation
via Tor. Just restrict posts initially to a "training subforum", and
allow full posting only after 10 or 20 acceptable posts. I've seen
many onion forums that do that. Establishing even a little reputation
is arguably too much work for forum spammers, no?
Solutions involving cross-session tokens are far more problematic. The
CloudFlare proposal for blind-signed tokens is interesting. But
there's the issue of trusting CloudFlare that some tracking feature
hasn't been embedded into the system.
It's not so much of an issue for me, because I compartmentalize my
online activity among multiple Whonix etc VMs on multiple hosts. So I
don't really care if everything done on a particular VM gets linked.
For serious compartmentalization, I use different hosts on different
LANs, to prevent GPU etc fingerprinting and LAN exploits. But most
people aren't as paranoid ;)
Anyway, that's what comes to mind.

Yes, it's partly that residential IPs are (or have been, anyway)
dynamic. So you'd end up blocking lots of IPs. But it's also that people
generally aren't using data-center IPs for Internet access, so blocking
them doesn't generate as many problems. Also, data-center IPs are
suspect, even if they're not tarred by abuse.

Thanks :) I'm stretching to get past my default urge to evade blocks.
I suppose that's possible. But assholes who could manage that might
find it easier to use burner VPS proxies, botnets, or soft botnets
like Hola/Luminati. And maybe evasion by Tor-using assholes is an
acceptable cost for benefits that Tor provides to people at risk.
Yes, Wilders  is moderated very
intensively. By a hierarchy of trusted volunteers, and administrators.
There is little tolerance for off-topic posts, and zero tolerance for
politics. Reddit, in contrast, is a total free-for-all. I'd say that
Wilders is about as family-friendly as FB :) Even more so than HN.
Yes, going rogue is a huge problem with subreddits. It doesn't happen
on Wilders, because it's much^N smaller, and criteria for trusted
moderators are much stricter. Identity farming is always an issue when
"anonymity" is possible. Wilders has zero tolerance for multiple
accounts, and violators tend to get nuked and their posts deleted.
Yes, that's the hardest problem. Why do sites care about the
relatively small share of users that want pseudonymous and/or
location-obscured access? FB has a Tor onion site, but they still want
to know who you are, and you still need a mobile account for text
Maybe worse, even setting aside the needs of worthy users, the arms
race between assholes and their targets is clearly escalating, and Tor
exit operators are getting caught in the crossfire. Ironically, in
recent discussion on the tor-relays list, some have argued that it's
website owners who are responsible for blocking abuse. And if they
can't manage that, they should just block access from Tor exits ;)
Based on my reading of tor-relays over the past few years, within 2-5
years it will be virtually impossible to find hosting for exit relays.
Unless, that is, they manage to block abusive traffic. And that would
be a fundamental break with Tor's laissez faire tradition.
So yes, hard times are coming, I fear.

True. Better would have been to say that it _can_ be a total

heavily moderated. Otherwise, I was going from what I've read about
Reddit's off-and-on efforts to manage rogue subreddits.
I caught Usenet just on the cusp of Eternal September. It was a dramatic
transformation. And so much greater need for moderation :(
It's arguably not very useful to consider "our notions of privacy and
security", because they're so diverse. People in small communities may
have virtually no privacy. People in large cities have grown accustomed
to privacy and relative anonymity. The Internet isn't as private as many
people assume. Maybe it was, back in the day, but that's just because
ISPs weren't looking. And it took a while for the NSA to master Internet
interception and data analysis. Anyway, some of us care, but the masses
remain clueless.

It's just that many ISPs are running low on IPv4 addresses, I think.
With static IPv4, ISPs typically assign based on your router's MAC.
And that's all typically related to your account. So changing router
MAC doesn't even work. If you want a new IPv4, just use VPNs :)
Look at . Access to 20,000 static (datacenter?)
IPv4s costs $1 per GB, with a $250/month minimum, whereas access to
13.5 million residential IPv4s (aka Hola users) costs $12.50 per GB,
with a $500/month minimum.

@_subject: [tor-talk] playing with OnionCat, VPNs and stuff 
Hash: SHA1
For the past couple months, I've been playing with OnionCat, exploring
its capabilities and potential use cases. Overall, I'm very impressed.
Basically, it enables point-to-point links between onion servers, in a
common IPv6 /48. And it's trivial to overlay VPNs, running in IPv6 UDP
mode, when you want full routing.
It's true that some of the use cases that I've explored involve
substantial traffic among onions. However, there are no exit relays
involved, and it's my impression that onions are underutilized. And
indeed, it's arguable that additional internal traffic improves
anonymity generally for Tor users.
A trivial use case is two onion servers, linked with OpenVPN (mode
p2p, proto udp6) via OnionCat. VPNs in UDP mode tolerate latency and
jitter well, and using UDP via TCP doesn't trigger retransmission
insanity. Latency between onions is typically 500ms to 1500ms, with at
most 10% packet loss.
For example, one can run a server (web, torrent tracker, or whatever)
on one onion. It can be reached at its onion hostname (directly, and
via OnionCat) and also through the OnionCat/VPN-linked onion, which
serves as a reverse proxy, at its public IP address or hostname.
The reverse proxy is discoverable, of course. However, it knows only
the OnionCat IPv6 address of the server, which is derived from its
OnionCat hostname. The server binds to the VPN tunnel, so the proxy
doesn't see its public IP address. And the proxy contains no content,
or user information. The proxy's host and ISP can log traffic, of
course. But that's the trade-off for providing open Internet access.
I also have a Freenet onion. It's fully reachable by opennet and
darknet peers, both at its OnionCat IPv6 address, and through its
reverse proxy on the open Internet. Latency is borderline high for
Freenet, and that causes ForwardRejectedOverload errors with some
peers. But I don't see errors in connections with my other test nodes,
which also have high connection timeouts. And so I suspect that this
could be resolved if connecting peers increased connection timeouts.
One can also connect many onion servers via full-mesh VPN in UDP mode,
such as tinc or PeerVPN. That works well enough with some distributed
file systems. Tahoe-LAFS and LizardFS work. They're slow, but they can
be tweaked to tolerate the latency and jitter. Unfortunately, LizardFS
only seems to work in chunk-replication mode, and not with erasure
coding or XOR goals. I expect that QFS would also work, and maybe even
Cleversafe, if its erasure coding handles latency well enough.

Running Tor on Windows makes little sense, given how much activity gets

Windows, at least use VirtualBox and run Whonix. While there's no real
isolation from the host OS, it's better than nothing. Anyone can run
Linux at work, on their own hardware. And running Tor on employer-owned
hardware, without permission, may well get one fired.

Yes, Microsoft would probably not divulge such user data freely, and
perhaps not even under subpoena. But consider Microsoft's risk model in
gathering the data. Conspiracy theories aside, they arguably gather it
for debugging and marketing. So even if it's encrypted, it may not be
secure against resourceful adversaries.
So anyway, if I wanted to use Tor on Windows machines where I couldn't
install stuff or boot Tails, such as at school or work, or in public
libraries, Tor browser would be my only option. I do get that. And for
sure, I would want a hardened browser.
But still, I would feel betrayed if Windows leaks pwned me, and Tor
Project hadn't warned me about that. And further, if I actually could
have installed VirtualBox and Whonix, I would feel betrayed that Tor
Project hadn't recommended that approach.
Right. And it's not just that Windows leaks data. It's just such a
security nightmare. Consider the FBI's NITs. Even if they have a Linux
dropper and payload, it would fail totally in Whonix, unless it could
break out to the host machine.

In that situation, hitting Tor network through a VPN service would
help. Or better, through a nested VPN chain. Or at least, if more
people in the area use VPNs than Tor. Some VPN services obfuscate
connections, using SSH, SSL, obfsproxy, etc.
Tor Project doesn't make that clear enough, in my opinion. There's
nothing on the front page. Consider the FBI's attack on PlayPen and
its users. Once the site had been compromised, that FBI operation
relied entirely on exploiting a Firefox vulnerability to drop malware
on users that phoned home, bypassing Tor.
Putting tor daemon and userland in separate VMs would have prevented
user compromise. Whonix does that, but there's no mention of Whonix on
Tor Project's site. If you dig around there, you can find old stuff
about the TorBOX project, which Whonix developed from. I have no clue
why Tor Project refuses to even mention Whonix. It's very strange.
Even firewall rules might have prevented FBI malware from bypassing
Tor to phone home. And even VPN services, which Tor Project frequently
slanders, recommend that users use firewall rules to prevent leaks.
Some VPN services provide custom clients with leak-free firewalls. So
why doesn't Tor Project prominently feature firewall rules?
Some may ask why we ought to care about pedophiles. But that's not the
point. We hear about the PlayPen attack because defendants in criminal
cases are questioning FBI practices. And because criminal cases in the
US are public, unless there are national security issues. But we
probably don't hear about similar attacks elsewhere, against political
dissidents etc.

Well, as your quote says, Tor picks a guard, and tries it. If that
doesn't work out, it picks another. And it repeats that process until it
has working circuits. I've looked at hundreds of state files, and there
are typically three guards listed. But sometimes there's just one, and
sometimes there are far more than three, if I've messed with the uplink
to prevent Tor from completing circuits. I believe that the top guard is
the one most recently used, but I'm not sure about that.
That's how I understand it. But I haven't studied the selection protocol
I'm certain that this is a local list. However, although communications
with directory servers are encrypted, local adversaries can see which
guards your client connects to. So they would probably know which ones
are listed in your state file, and maybe even the order.
For ordered sets of three guards, chosen randomly from N relays with
guard flags, uniqueness would be "N!". Even with bandwidth-biased
selection, it's arguably at least N^2.
However, guard choice seems more constrained than I had imagined. Some
guards are chosen quite often. I've retained state files for 102 Tor
(v0.2.9.9) instances, with altogether 299 guards selected. In 260 (87%)
of the selections, distinct guards were chosen, with no duplication.
However, 15 guards were chosen in two state files (10% of selections)
and three guards were chosen in three state files (3% of selections).

provider. I've heard similar reports from others.
What to do? If anyone has contacts at BitPay, please use them. And what
are possible workarounds? Maybe specify exits with unlisted IPs. It's
too bad that Tor doesn't have exit bridges ;) I'll probably end up
routing a free VPN service through Tor.
Longer term, what Tor-friendly Bitcoin/altcoin payment processors can we
recommend to service providers?

It sounds like KYC stuff :(
Bitcoin payments aren't readily reversible, so this must be KYC stuff. I
also vaguely recall that Bitpay was rejecting Bitcoin that had been
stolen. And given that stolen Bitcoin is soon mixed well, there's some
of it everywhere (except fresh coin from miners). Like cocaine on $20s.
So now I wonder how many of those providers with BitPay glitches had
lost, or are in the process of losing, their accounts.
What's the replacement for BitPay? Coinbase? I few providers are
managing their own wallets, but that brings it's own issues.

Well, I recall complaints from AirVPN about people routing Tor exits
through it. Which was adding to their abuse and block-list problems. So
it arguably ought to be a private VPN.
Problematic is limited IPv4 resource. I wonder if there's some way to do
ephemeral routable IPv6. I mean, why do proxies need addresses that last
more than a day? Why not give every circuit a different IPv6?
Always good :)

OK, some streams do last more than a day. But then they must pin the
exit relay, right? So in that case, you'd keep the IPv6 until the stream
ended, even if there were circuit changes with different middle relays.
I don't get why changing exit IPv6 would break resuming by client-side
apps. They don't (and shouldn't, obviously) manage exit IPs. Tor daemon
handles that. So they'd be oblivious as long as exit IPv6 persisted as
long as relevant streams, right?
Well, I got a couple /64 for free from GigaTux for a low-end VPS. For
the VPN-testing project. And they do run a Tor relay, if I recall
correctly. A /64 gives you 1.8 x 10^19 IPv6. With ~2 x 10^6 daily users,
that's ~10^13 circuit days per user. So hey, I'll ask.
But how would Tor Project's relay monitoring work for exits with no
stable IPv6 address? Wouldn't they lose the exit flag?

You could route a VPN through Tor. If those resources accept the VPN
exit IPs, it should work. AirVPN has instructions for routing their
client Eddie through Tor.[0] But with Tails, you'd need to install and
configure Eddie at each boot. You can also do it in Whonix, and the
setup will persist. But for both, you'd need to tweak Tor browser so it
doesn't connect directly via Tor, but through AirVPN which is routed
through Tor.

Hey, I get where you're coming from. The Tor Project wiki isn't all that
helpful about standalone Tor setup in Windows. However, although I have
zero affiliation with the Tor Project, it's my impression that this
hasn't entirely been an oversight. In particular, I get that running
relays in Windows is discouraged, in light of security concerns. That
is, they're arguably more likely pwned by adversaries, and used to
attack the network. And I suspect also that there are concerns about
torrenting, which stresses the system.
Perhaps more fundamentally, there are concerns about surveillance by
Microsoft. I mean, using Tor arguably secures network traffic from
adversaries, but what secures the system from Microsoft? In particular,
unless users take extreme effort, Microsoft knows their identityies. And
if Microsoft is logging browsing and other network traffic, and file
operations, it arguably knows what users are doing, notwithstanding Tor.
So anyway, how does ProxAllium address those concerns?

Sure. There's some literature. Check out
Micah Lee's article has some good suggestions. And you can also use
hosted SIMs. For example,  Before creating
your messaging, social media, etc account, you login at SpeedyVerify,
and start a chat with support. You tell them which SIM / mobile number
you'll be using. Then you create the account, with mobile
authentication. SpeedyVerify support will give you the authentication code.
There's also an API, which can handle bulk authentication. I suspect
that services like this facilitate bot networks and scamming on Twitter,
Facebook, and so on.
It's true that the SIM host sees your activation code. But that process
isn't really secure, in any case. And I don't believe that it lets them
hack your account, because it's a one-time code. And they don't know
your password.
It's also true that you must provide email and contact information to
SpeedyVerify, including a telephone number. But they don't seem to
verify that stuff, and they accept Bitcoin.

It does indeed. But it's a fragile thing, in that there's no protection
against malware that bypasses Tor. FBI's NIT is a clear demonstration.
There's no firewall, unless the user configures one.
Documentation for using Tor as a standalone service is rather iffy and
poorly maintained, is it not? Especially for Windows. Not that I'd
encourage anyone to use Tor in Windows.
Maybe "a subverted tor" wouldn't be stupid enough to do that, but that's
what FBI's NIT does. And that's how many Tor users got pwned by it.
Yes, it doesn't work to secure Tor using iptables rules that are based
on IPs and ports. What does work is only allowing outbound traffic from
the Tor process. Or better yes, running Tor in a separate gateway
machine/VM, and allowing the workspace machine/VM to connect only to Tor
in the gateway. Which is what Whonix does, right out of the box.
This _is_ good stuff.

Hey :)
I do get the benefit of making Tor browser dead simple to use. And I get
that it's secure enough for most Tor users, who likely aren't at risk
from Tor-bypassing malware.
But it would be very cool if its vulnerabilities were clearly disclosed.
On the download page. There's already disclosure (but maybe not explicit
enough) that Tor isn't secure against global adversaries. So why not
disclosure that Tor browser isn't secure against Tor-bypassing malware?
As I understand it, FBI's NIT gets dropped through Firefox, but it
phones home through a standalone process. So restricting Firefox to Tor
wouldn't be enough. But even if I'm wrong about existing malware, what I
describe is doable. It's already a risk when opening downloaded files.
I can't deny that :) But OP does have a point about the difficulty in

It's not that hard to reconfigure Tor browser to work with standalone

local network. The other VPS runs the Tor client, and it has two

other on the same local network as the server VPS. There's no routing on
the local network, just HiddenServicePort forwarding.

Hey, sorry about that :( And I do got your point about backups.
Although, in retrospect, a backup setup with relatively fast rotation,
and thorough deletion of old backups, would be prudent.
As I said, shared hosting is a security nightmare. As I understand it,
you're depending on not much more than permissions to protect users from
each other. And in that situation, it's not _that_ hard for a skilled
hacker to get root, and do what they like.
If I were going to attempt such an .onion hosting setup, I'd use a
couple levels of isolation between users. But first, I'd use LUKS with
dropbear for server FDE. It ain't perfect, but an attacker would need to
take some care while impounding the server.
Basically, I'd setup several KVM domains, to help limit damage from a
compromise. Within each domain, I'd put each website in a Docker
container. Given a custom Docker-optimized kernel for the host, and XFS
storage, it's possible to set hard limits on CPU, RAM and storage for
each Docker container.
Docker containers rely on kernel namespaces and cgroups. That's not as
secure as using full VMs, but _far_ lighter. And _far_ more secure than
chroot, which many shared-hosting setups still rely on. Alternatively,
one could use FreeBSD jails, and maybe that can also work with Docker.
Anyway, if you're interested, I'd be happy to help. I'm just a hobbyist,
and totally self-taught. I mostly just use shell scripts. And I lack the
patience and organization to actually operate a shared-hosting site.

Sure, but this isn't a _Tor_ issue. It's just about Tor browser, which

I'm guessing that it's impossible to guarantee what some code will or
won't leave behind when it crashes. Even if you tweaked the browser to
never write temp files to disk, and keep everything in RAM, you couldn't
guarantee that the OS won't write stuff to disk.
That is, unless there _is_ no disk, as in Tails. Even with Whonix,
traces likely remain in the virtual disk. And sure, you can run Whonix
with virtual disks, which don't persist changes. But even then, who's to
say what might get left on the host. I'm less familiar with other

I'm not sure what you mean by this.
Does "node that serves a Hidden service" mean the machine that's running
the web server or whatever, or the machine that's serving as its Tor
guard? Normally, machines running .onion web servers _never_ reveal
their public IP addresses, and indeed, shouldn't even have them.
Guards for .onion server are typically public guards. However, you can
use your own bridge, and not publish it.
If we're talking about a private bridge, yes. You can just not tell
anyone about it, and so it will only serve as a guard for your .onion.
Also, just to be clear, it's a bad idea to run an .onion web server on
the same machine as a Tor relay, even a private guard.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor browser and VPN or web proxy 
True. But this is the most dangerous way to combine Tor and VPNs.
If you connect first through a VPN (yours or a commercial service) and
then to Tor, the VPN becomes like your ISP. It encrypts and obscures
your traffic. So your ISP can't easily tell that you connect with Tor,
or what you otherwise connect with directly.
But your VPN provider _does_ know all that. Also, some argue that VPN
services are more likely malicious than ISPs, and so potentially
compromise your Tor use. But others (including Mirimir) argue that ISPs
are more readily compromised by local adversaries, so using VPN services
increases security and privacy for Tor use.
Also, if you connect to Tor through a VPN, entry guards can't easily
know your ISP-assigned IP address. So malicious entry guards (or those
who had compromised them) would need to get that information from your
VPN provider. That would have provided some protection against CMU's
relay-early exploit, which pwned many .onion services and users.
However, connecting first to Tor, and then through Tor circuits to a
VPN, is _far_ more dangerous. Bottom line, you throw away all of the
anonymity that Tor can provide. That's because your VPN provider may
know who you are. Perhaps because you paid them in some traceable way.
Or perhaps because you accidentally connected directly, and not through
Tor, revealing your ISP-assigned IP address to them.
However, if you're careful, you can use VPNs through Tor to 1) avoid
Tor-specific CAPTCHAs, 2) route UDP traffic, and 3) use online services
that generally don't work well with Tor alone.

Right. Didn't think of that. And yes, that _is_ a safe use case. Because

Even so, for that you might as well use a VPN service, instead of Tor.
Because performance will be much better. Unless it's important to hide
corporate affiliation from more than just local adversaries.

True. And there are some limitations. As far as I know, all live
read-only systems allocate half of the physical RAM to the system, and
half to working memory. So if your machine has 4GB RM, you can load at
most a 2GB system image.
But DVDs can hold ~4.7GB. So if your machine has 8GB RAM, you can load
4GB from the DVD. Years ago, I built a live ISO with Debian, VirtualBox,
a pfSense VPN gateway VM, and stripped-down Whonix gateway and
workstation VMs. The workstation VM had just a simple openbox GUI. It
took several minutes to boot, but was very responsive afterward.
Or just unplug the data and power cables.

it did take some minutes to come up in the 8GB machine.
Wild guess: maybe you need to design LiveCDs so they'll boot quickly in

@_subject: [tor-talk] Onion website on "usual" server 
Read the stuff that Cyaniventer linked, for sure.
But here's the problem. You run some web server, hosting (I gather)
multiple websites. That implies that you understand how to do that.
If you do, you just add another site to the config, which binds only to
127.0.0.1 using a different port (say 8000). Then you setup an onion
service that points to 127.0.0.1:8000. Also, you make sure that none of
your clearnet sites bind to 127.0.0.1 (just in case).
Even so, that's a little fragile. Mistakes happen. And there's the issue
of web server error messages from the onion site going to clearnet.
That's one of the mistakes that got DPR pwned.
The safest bet is running KVM on your server, and using a VM for the
onion site. And if that's too heavy, even Docker would help.

Your safest option, if you must use WhatsApp, is to use it in an Android
VM, running on a small tablet, which uses WiFi for connectivity. You can
lease real mobile SIMs from sites like  and do
it ~anonymously using well-mixed Bitcoin.
I don't know whether WhatsApp absolutely requires UDP. If it does, then
using Tor would be difficult. You'd probably need to route a TCP-based
VPN service through it. Or instead, you could just use a VPN service, or
better, a nested VPN chain. I could offer more information if you like.

I know nothing about Windows mobile devices. If it will run VirtualBox,
and the Android VM can reach the Internet, sure. That way, you can run a
VPN client on the W10, and connect the Android VM through it. Or via
Tor, if that works.
Sites like that provide shared virtual mobile numbers. Some services
won't accept them. Also, phone numbers for WhatsApp accounts are really
the account IDs. So you need something that's ~permanent. Using that
site I linked, you actually buy SIMs. They just plug them into their
system, when you need to use them. As far as I know, they don't charge
"rent" for SIMs. You just buy "five uses" (or whatever) packages.
Find out whether WhatsApp really needs UDP. If it does, you can email me
off-list, and we can discuss options.

@_author: Mirimir 
@_subject: [tor-talk] Nice to meet you! / WhatsApp by Tor? 
Upon reflection, maybe I've missed the obvious option. Which is to just
run a Tor client on the phone, and WhatsApp with CCProxy.
So does that work?
And of course, if WhatsApp can see everything, there's no point to doing
it. And maybe that's where I was coming from. Basically, don't use a
real phone. Just an Android VM. Because that you can totally lock down.
Oh. Sorry.
HyperV is OK, I guess. I used it, long ago. It might run VMs faster on
Windows 10 than VirtualBox does. But there is the possibility that the
Android VM won't work well with it.
I said that because I thought you were using Windows mobile. For Windows
10 on a PC, there shouldn't be problems. But if there are, it might be
that the Android VM is picky about network interface hardware. pfSense
chokes on some hardware, as I recall.
Yes, you run a version of Android that's been tweaked to run as a VM.
The host machine provides a "fake WiFi" connection for it. There's no
cellular account.
If you can use WhatsApp via a Tor SocksPort, using CCProxy or whatever,
that would be simplest. But Tor doesn't route UDP, so as I've said, you
need to verify that WhatsApp works without UDP connectivity.
If you need UDP for WhatsApp, and also want Tor-level anonymity, you'll
need to route a VPN through Tor. That's doable, because OpenVPN has a
socks-proxy option, and will use a Tor SocksPort. But you need to use
the VPN in TCP mode, because Tor doesn't route UDP.
You could run the VPN-via-Tor thing in the host machine, and the Android
VM would reach the Internet through the VPN tunnel. Or you could use a
gateway VM. I recommend using a gateway VM, because it gives you some
isolation, and it's easy to lock down with firewall (iptables) rules.
The VM is the Android device, which runs your WhatsApp client. There is
no separate smartphone. You can lock down the Android VM, so WhatsApp
can't see anything from the host machine. Such as your ISP-assigned IP.
Both Tor and VPNs protect you from observation by your ISP. And to some
extent, from governments. And both prevent WhatsApp, and your contacts,
from knowing your IP address.
Tor is far^N better at that than VPNs are. But if WhatsApp won't work
directly via Tor, you'll need a VPN.
As Cyaniventer noted, using services like that would be totally
insecure. I suppose that the same argument applies to Speedyverify, but
at least they're (hopefully) not sharing your SIM with others.
Sure, but it needs to work for a while, at least.

I've not heard of "Tor v3 Onion Networking". Does it exist? Or if not,
are there plans?
Or do you mean just using v3 onion-onion sockets? That would be painful.
If there were native overlay networking among v3 onions, which handled
UDP as well as TCP, that would arguably be a better solution. But you
can't just invent an addressing scheme, because none of the existing
tools and apps could use it. For compatibility, isn't IPv6 the only
workable approach? The IPv4 space is way too small.
Indeed, as discussed in other threads, v3 onion mapping would take a
large chunk of IPv6. And that would mean stepping on assigned public
IPv6 ranges. Or just using a restricted v3 address space.

I don't do audio on this box. I do a pretty good job of keeping cameras

Let's say that I have a bunch of VPS, running Tor and OnionCat. Each has
the others' OnionCat IPv6 addresses in its /etc/hosts. Now I can use any
app that talks TCP/IP, without customization (except re latency).
I'm sure that one could write code that did all the same stuff, using
actual v3 onion hostnames. There are probably Python (or whatever)
libraries for that. And maybe that's the best approach. But whatever it
was, it'd be cool if tools like ping, bbcp, etc could interface with it.
Yeah, something like that :)
What do you mean by "services"? If all you have is SOCKS5, you're pretty
limited. Unless you use shims like AF_X25. I never had to use that, but
I'm sure that OnionCat is far less hassle.

@_subject: [tor-talk] [Cryptography] Implementing full Internet IPv6 
OK. Hopefully you point to some resources for learning that stuff.
Yes, with OnionCat, you're on an open LAN. So I use restrictive iptables
rules for IPv6. Just as I do for IPv4. I drop all packets by default,
and allow only required addresses and ports.
I suppose. But way back when, one could have used the same argument
against development of TCP/IP. Perhaps you do. But damn, it'd be a very
different Internet. And perhaps you would have preferred that. Yes?
OK, thanks.
My friends and I use OnionCat quite heavily. We're interested in
reliable private networking for mutually anonymous servers. Primarily as
a capability, and not for any particular application. But for example,
say that one must transfer filesystem images or VMs, for backup or
sharing. We've found that bbcp (using the MPTCP kernel, with multiple
OnionCat interfaces) works very well for that.
Stuff that requires UDP transport is especially problematic with Tor.
Private Docker registries, for example. We've tested a few VPNs in TCP
mode, but nothing has proved as reliable as OnionCat. It is necessary to
use custom wrappers, I admit, because the stock systemd service is quite
fragile. Or maybe it's just that OnionCat is no longer maintained.
In recent years, my friends and I have played with various P2P networks
(such as Freenet, BitTorrent and various VoIP apps) and distributed
filesystems (such as LizardFS, QFS and Tahoe-LAFS). The P2P stuff tends
to work well enough with Tor+OnionCat. But high latency tends to be
problematic for distributed filesystems (albeit less so for Tahoe-LAFS).
I appreciate concerns about overloading the Tor network. However, it's
arguable that increased traffic among onions, as chaff, would actually
improve anonymity for other users. And it's my understanding that it's
exit bandwidth that's most limited. But OnionCat puts no explicit load
on exit-only relays.
relays without the exit flag (middle relays and most guards) are
underutilized. Currently, 110 Gbit/s out of 240 Gbit/s is consumed.
That's less than 50%, on average. Also, it's my impression that, given
Tor's relay-selection logic, only the fastest non-exit relays get much
use at all. And based on a recent thread on tor-relays, even some
high-speed non-exit relays see only ~20% utilization.
Anyway, that's why I value OnionCat. If I had to, I could learn to use
v3 onion sockets. But I fear that it would be painful.

Where do you see that? I've reread his post several times, and see
nothing about "adversaries should finance tor project". It is true that
some criticize Tor because it was originally a US Navy project, and
still gets funding from US governmental entities. But that's not an
argument that I recall grarpamp ever making. Unless he's juan, anyway.
The main thrust of his criticism, as I interpret it, is that Tor
explicitly doesn't protect against global passive adversaries. Let alone
global _active_ adversaries, such as the NSA. As I understand it, that
reflected both "it would be too hard to do that, without unacceptable
latency and traffic overhead" and "they don't likely exist, or if they
do, they're our friends".
Some systems have been proposed that use padding and chaff to make
traffic analysis harder. But as grarpamp says, it'd be hard for the Tor
Project to implement stuff like that in the existing Tor network. Much
harder than the v3 onion upgrade, anyway. And the other side of it is
that Tor works well enough that implementing one of the newer designs
seems unlikely. Given that potential volunteers are working on Tor.

pkg-config g++ libpulse-dev
Then clone the Tor Browser source.
$ git clone Don't worry about the "can't checkout" error, because git branch -a
handles that.
$ cd tor-browser
$ git branch -a
$ git checkout remotes/origin/tor-browser-31.5.0esr-4.5-1

$ make $CONFIGURE_ARGS -f client.mk configure
Disable Tor Browser update, because none is available.

@_subject: [tor-talk]  Decent guide to setting up an .onion site on a VPS? 
It's not fundamentally that different. And what's different is more
about VPS security than about Tor. I'm not up for writing a complete
guide right now. But I'll share some points, which you can fill in
through searching. They apply to Debian x64.
First, if you want your onion service to be ~anonymous, you must not
provide any real contact information, and you must do everything via
Tor. That basically means paying with well-mixed Bitcoin. To avoid leaks
locally, it's prudent to work in Whonix. You'll need to login to your
VPS via Tor, and that's safer using Whonix than just torsocks.
It's best to use VPS providers that don't require contact information.
CockBox is a good one, not too expensive, and quite Tor friendly.
BitHost (a DO reseller) is OK, but too expensive, and isn't so Tor
I've also had good service from a few VPS providers that do require
contact information, but don't verify. Such as VPS.BG and HostSailor.
Second, once you have your VPS, you SSH to it via Tor. Before doing
anything else, change the root password, and create a user account. Then
configure SSH for key-based login as user. Because if someone steals
your private key, and logs in, at least they won't have root privileges.
There are many guides for that, so I won't make another here. I do note
that "ssh-keygen" by default creates 2048-bit RSA keys, and that many
swear by longer keys, and other algorithms (such as AES). Also, set
"PasswordAuthentication no" in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config". And if you decide
to SSH login as root, also set "PermitRootLogin prohibit-password". Then
restart SSH ('systemctl restart ssh") and test with another SSH login
before disconnecting the existing one.
Now install the latest Tor release, and upgrade the system. See
 and also install
"iptables-persistent". Then "apt-get -y dist-upgrade", and reboot.
Then setup Tor. The Tor Project guide for onion services is a little
confusing, because it covers Windows, MacOS and Linux. So also see
for a sample torrc. In Linux, " is typically "/var".
By default, Tor now creates v3 onion services. If you want a v2 onion
service, you must specify that, as the guide shows (Step Four).
Now setup iptables, in iptables-persistent, to make sure that your onion
service doesn't leak in clearnet. Do "ip a" to get your interface name,
and use that instead of "eth0" in the rules below. Do "id -u debian-tor"
to get Tor's UID, and use that instead of "107" in the rules below.
Unless you have good reason not to, block all IPv6 traffic. For IPv4,
allow only SSH in, and only Tor. Plus related established connections.
# nano /etc/iptables/rules.v6
# ip6tables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v6
# nano /etc/iptables/test-rules.v4
# iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/test-rules.v4
Now verify that you can still SSH in, from a new local terminal. If you
can, rename /etc/iptables/test-rules.v4 as /etc/iptables/rules.v4
# mv /etc/iptables/rules.v4 /etc/iptables/open-rules.v4
# mv /etc/iptables/test-rules.v4 /etc/iptables/rules.v4
You could also create an SSH onion service, and login using that,
instead of Tor exit to clearnet SSH port. That increases login
anonymity. But blocking clearnet SSH entirely in iptables is risky.
Because if something goes wrong with Tor setup in the VPS, you'll be
unable to login. And so you'll need to redo the VPS from scratch.
Anyway, then install nginx (not apache) and change the listen address
from 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.1
# nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
That should about do it. In creating your site, don't use any
third-party resources, and keep it simple. Static sites are most secure,
and load much faster. Scripts and databases provide more features, but
are risky unless you know what you're doing.

@_author: Mirimir 
@_subject: [tor-talk] How to use Tor without a website knowing I am using 
There is no entirely good way.
There's the Cloudflare Onion Service.[0,1,2] Basically, Cloudflare
redirects Tor users to its onion service, which then connects to the
website. So there's no exit involved, and no CAPTCHAs. However, that
only works for sites that use Cloudflare. And both you and the site must
trust them.
Not bridges. That's on the guard side. Maybe "exit bridges". But those
would be blacklisted just as fast as exits are.
If you're desperate, you can try an HTTPS proxy, or route a VPN via Tor.
But HTTPS proxies are typically scummy, and may inject ads, or even drop
malware. Some VPN services are probably honest, but most of them are
also scummy.
Your best bet is running your own HTTPS proxy or VPN, on a VPS. But it
must be a VPS leased anonymously through Tor, using Bitcoin that's been
mixed at least twice through Tor. Some VPS providers accept other
cryptocurrencies that may be intrinsically more anonymous than Bitcoin.
But even so, that funnels your Tor traffic through that VPS. So you're
no longer just some anonymous Tor user. You're linked to that VPS. So if
it gets linked to you, then everything you've done through it gets
linked to you. Also, if you use a VPN, that pins the Tor circuit that
it's using. And that increases the risk of traffic analysis.
Bottom line. Using HTTPS proxies or VPNs through Tor is dangerous. So if
you do it at all, you should only do it only when absolutely necessary.
Using your own HTTPS proxy is probably the least dangerous option,
because that doesn't pin Tor circuits.

doesn't handle. You can see if there's a way to force it to use TCP.

Yes, VoIP via UDP works very well through Tor with OnionCat. However,
both endpoints must be running Tor and OnionCat. Basically, all devices
running Tor and OnionCat have IPv6 addresses in the same /48 subnet. So
any such device can connect with any other. But _not_ with any other
IPv6 (or IPv4) address. Unless someone setup a router, I suppose.
Yes, you can route VPNs through Tor. However, I don't recommend doing
that except in Whonix. Otherwise, there's too much risk that the VPN
will connect directly, instead of through Tor, and blow your anonymity.
You could use a commercial VPN service, or run your own VPN server in a
VPS. But either way, you'd need to do everything ~anonymously through
Tor. Or in other words, your anonymity using the VPN via Tor will be
limited by how anonymously you paid for the VPN service or VPS. So that
means well-mixed Bitcoin, or better perhaps Monero.
All things considered, it'd be simpler, and arguably more anonymous, if
you can force Jitsi to use TCP via plain Tor.

Open about:config, and search "extensions.torlauncher".
Set "extensions.torlauncher.prompt_at_startup" to false.
Set "extensions.torlauncher.start_tor" to false.
Now Tor browser won't start Tor.

You also need apt-transport-https and the Tor repo's gpg key. Plus
deb.torproject.org-keyring to keep the key current.

That depends.
Whonix would protect users against malware that bypasses Tor browser.
Perhaps Tails would as well, given its iptables rules, but arguably not
as well as Whonix does. Because in Whonix, Tor client and apps are in
separate VMs, and there's no forwarding from the workstation VM, just
SocksPorts exposed to it on the gateway VM.
And onion services could also use Whonix, or at least the basic concept
of Whonix, implemented in KVM or VBox VMs on the server. Onion services
on Tails would be harder, but probably doable.
However, neither Whonix or Tails would protect users or onion services
against attacks that manipulate Tor clients into using malicious guards.
And once an adversary controls the guard, it knows the IP address of the
user or server. Tails might even be more vulnerable, because it picks
new guards at each boot.
As far as I know, there just two ways to defend against attacks via
malicious guards. One is using vanguards.[0,1] The other is simply
hiding the user's or server's IP address from the guard, using a VPN
service, or a nested VPN chain.

@_subject: [tor-talk] How secure is a hidden service? 
Yep. That's the fundamental problem.
I've looked at many of them, and I generally agree. The only exception
I'm sure of is relay early, which took down at least PlayPen, and ~1000
of its users, directly or indirectly. I'm not sorry about them, but we
don't know who else exploited it, against whom, or for how long.
There's also Freedom Hosting and Freedom Hosting II. Although I haven't
seen anything clear about how they were compromised, it seems arguable
(even obvious, in retrospect) that servers with numerous onion URLs are
far^N  more vulnerable. Not to say, doomed.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Ports required for Tor and hidden services 
If you're that paranoid, you can use the Whonix model. Basically, run
the Tor process and firewall on one machine, with requisite ports
exposed on an isolated LAN. And run the web server on another machine,
connected via that LAN. So nothing on that machine can see the Internet,
except through Tor.
If you control physical access, it's most secure for those to be
separate hardware. Otherwise, you can use KVM VMs. You can even run KVM
VMs on some KVM VPS, although it's a little sluggish.

@_subject: [tor-talk] restricting output to the tor process, 
OK, so I don't use standalone Tor browser, just in Whonix.
And when I use Tor in Debian, I use iptables rules like:
:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
-A INPUT -s 127.0.0.1/32 -d 127.0.0.1/32 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -j DROP
-A FORWARD -j DROP
-A OUTPUT -s 127.0.0.1/32 -d 127.0.0.1/32 -j ACCEPT
-A OUTPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner debian-tor -j ACCEPT
-A OUTPUT -j DROP
But, in a Debian VM running Tor browser, I found that the tor process is
running as the login user. And so iptables is totally useless.
However, it's apparently easy to start Tor browser as its own user,
using Micah Lee's torbrowser-launcher.[0] Is that a prudent solution?

@_subject: [tor-talk] restricting output to the tor process, 
Oh, right. So I could allow output by whatever uid-owner I created, and
block all other users. That would prevent random malware from bypassing
Tor. But it wouldn't prevent compromised Tor browser from doing it.
So somehow I just need to have the tor process run as a unique user.
I created a user tbtor as described in the post that I cited, and tried
tweaking the Tor browser torrc:
But the tor process crashes. I'm guessing that this is breaking the
process of starting as root, and dropping capabilities. But I'm not
sure, and in any case don't know how to fix it.
I've read in Tor.SE that the Tor browser torrc is optimized. So using
tor with default torrc is less anonymous. I suppose that one could just
use the Tor browser torrc. But I guess that I'll play with it.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Using a Solid Tor Configuration 
The simplest approach is using Whonix. There are two Linux virtual
machines. The gateway VM just runs the Tor process, and the workstation
VM runs Tor browser and other apps. The workstation VM has no network
connectivity except via Tor, and so malware can't bypass Tor.
It's easy enough to run Whonix in Virtualbox on Linux. And you could
even use Virtualbox on Windows, although I don't recommend that. Using
Whonix in Qubes is more secure, but not so easy.
I recommend using Whonix through VPN services, because it hides Tor use
from your ISP. It would also protect somewhat against malicious entry
guards, and from circuit deanonymization. Better yet is using Tor
through nested VPN chains, because that prevents any individual VPN
service from linking you and your entry guards.
