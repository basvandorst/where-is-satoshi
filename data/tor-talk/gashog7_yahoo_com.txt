@_subject: [tor-talk] restoring tor from a crash 
I was wondering which file the noscript options are stored in? I
had my torbrowser crash and when I clicked on the firefox restore after
it did and it wiped all settings and would not load tor. I downloaded a
fresh copy and renamed the old folder so as not to lose anything but am
unsure where to find the files needed to restore it to the prior state.
 Any help is much appreciated.

@_subject: [tor-talk] info needed to recover from tor browser crash 
Recently my tor browser crashed and mistakenly clicked the restore
option when the browser came back up only to lose all the noscript
settings.  A fresh copy was installed into a new folder so the old one
is thankfully intact.  Does anyone know what the file is that stores
those options and where to find it to restore it to the prior state?
