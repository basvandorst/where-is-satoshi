@_subject: Sending mail through TOR/Socks 
I don't know if anybody is doing the same thing but I've set up one of
my personal domains smtp/pop3 emails to use Thunderbird/SOCKS/Tor so
that the receipients can't pinpoint my IP.
However, I notice a persistent phenomenon with this setup is that
receiving emails usually works, but sending mail often fails for no
apparent reason except the generic message from Tbird that it either
cannot connect or the smtp server is refusing connections.
It's highly random, I could send one email and it goes through but the
next doesn't, within the space of a minute.
If I did a direct smtp without going through socks/TOR, it will work
fine. Surfing my personal domain using Firefox through privocy/TOR
also works.
 I'm guessing that most of the folks running TOR exit servers are
refusing smtp ports so I'm basically on a random hit/miss whenever tor
attempts to create a circuit to send the email. But surely TOR should
realize when trying to create a circuit, it should at least look for
nodes that are willing to carry the pending packet?
Anybody has a better clearer idea what could be causing this problem? Thanks!

I don't have control over the SMTP server on the webhost side so
that's not really an option. :(

I'm aware of this and believe that it's a lot easier to convince my
webhost, if it comes down to it, to not block TOR exit nodes which
many does not appear to be accepting SMTP anyway, compared to if my
IPs are being used for massive spammage.
Furthermore, I've got pretty much a authoritarian/autocratic
government pretending to be democratic here so I'm not taking any
chances of being made an public example of "abetting illegal
commercial spamming" than I already have. The few ISPs are basically
commercial extensions of the government and getting my account banned
from one effectively leaves me with pretty much no choices.

Ah, that's good to know, I had certainly hoped the developers wasn't
so careless as to overlook something like that.
Hmm, if my webhost does block the TOR port 25 exit node, then it would
make sense they would had blocked both. Which means I should not be
able to send emails at all.

Just tested this and it works (of course Murphy made sure that port 25
was also happily working tonight).
I'll probably have to look into one more thing since I think most of
the time I'm having problems seems to be on my laptop at the office.
Worse come to worst, I guess I will just have to go back to using TOR
with the domain's webmail. Been trying to avoid this since web mail is
typically snail paced and going through TOR means additional latency
plus pointless html traffic for the onion network.

@_subject: Any Windows SMTP servers that can work with Socks/TOR? 
Sorry to have to ask this, I know many of you are on *nix but some of
us are stuck on Windows outside of home.
Right now unless the email is sent via webmail, going through
Tor/privocy, the receiver always see the chain of servers the email is
sent from. The last line in the chain shows the IP of the sender so
privacy is compromised.

So does anybody know of any SMTP server that will work on Windows and
can be used with TOR to anonymize sent emails, i.e. recipients will
only see it as being sent from localhost or 127.0.0.1

Thanks a lot Glymr for leading me to the solution I need, junking my
current email client for Thunderbird :D
Once I got Thunderbird to use Privoxy for Socks and go through TOR,
that solved the problem. I'm using my own domain name/web server so
the problem of having them free webmail track me isn't an issue.
I'm not sure why you said I cannot send anything in/out on the SMTP
port with Tor because it worked for me.
Now I just need to get around to setting up a dedicated box to run Tor
instead of having it on this Windows machine :D
Thanks again!

Not using the webmail plugin. The plugin appears only to work with
free public webmail like yahoo and hotmail. So it wouldn't had worked
with the webmail access most of us will typically have when using our
own domain names.
I am running TOR as a test server (can't run a permananent once with
dynamic IP) and not just as a client so did adjust some of the
settings, so that would probably explain why port 25 works.

I doubt most administrators care about the difference. The concern
would be if such a module becomes a standard part of most servers, it
would effectively take all static IP TOR routers out of the web and
subsequently affecting the desirability of using TOR, wouldn't it?

@_subject: Tor and Thunderbird: Outgoing Email Unsafe? 
Run a TOR server node yourself. I have a spare 'server' that runs most of my
web based services, such as Apache/MySQL for testing. I also run a TOR
service off it and enabled SMTP port.
For emails that I do not wish to be traced geographically, I set Thunderbird
to use that machine as a SOCKS proxy. It works on both port 25 or the common
alternative 587. Not 100% painless however as sometimes it just refuses to
connect, maybe because TOR can't find another exit node allowing 25/587. But
most of the time nowadays trying to send a few more times will result in a
