@_subject: [tor-talk] Super speed Tor 
Current Tor connection speed is pretty neat, few years ago it was much
slower, like in order of magnitude slower. If you find Tor slow, maybe
it's time to contribute? I myself contribute for that reason, serving
some relays/exits on 100Mbit-1Gbit lanes. If you don't want to run a
relay yourself, maybe it'd be a good idea to donate few bucks to those
who do? torservers.net for example.
You've answered yourself :-)
