Hi Wojtek,
there are already 5 applications for improvements to the Scanner, so  if you think something else interests you, you may be better suited to  choose that.

@_subject: getting more exit nodes 
I don't think a browser plugin is a good choice for an application  that can act as a Tor exit node. Please note how long it takes for a  Tor node to be used by clients, and how often Users close their  browsers. I think this will produce a huge amount of overhead when  such nodes are sending their descriptors and others will try to use  them a few hours later, when they have been shut down again.
There is another reason why I think a browser plugin is ill suited: In  my opinion, users want browser plugins for a specific purpose, for  example play a movie or block Flash. They don't want a plugin that  does arbitrary things they don't quite understand.
If you find a good solution for how to make use of Tor relays behind  restrictive firewalls, that'd be most awesome, but I think such an  approach should be included in the Tor software.
Note that currently, any relay must be able to connect to any other

Hi everybody,
I'm excited to be able to work for the Tor project in this year's  Google Summer of Code! Thanks to everybody who has helped me get  familiar with Tor so far, and special thanks to Nick Matthewson as he  will be mentoring me in my attempts to create an application able of  executing automated testing of the Tor network or private Tor networks.
My application abstract is available at If you have any comments, I'm glad to hear from you! I will post some  notes indicating progress during the summer, so people can see where I  am. If you want to discuss the project with me or generally have a  little chat,  on freenode is the place to be :)
I'm very happy the Tor project has been allowed seven participants  this summer, let's hack!

@_subject: Proposal: Tor User Agent Carousel (TUAC) 
Hi there,
thanks for your idea. Please find my comments below:
This has actually been asked for before. Please see   About the implementation: This has nothing to do with Vidalia or TorK,  as both programs work with Tor preferences, but not with your everyday  webbrowsing. It also doesn't belong with Tor, because Tor is protocol- agnostic, which means that we don't inspect traffic to change http- headers (also, this wouldn't work for https-connections).
So really, if such a feature were to be implemented, the right place  would in fact be Torbutton or privoxy or some other proxy.
You believe they should have that option, but does it help or hurt  anonymity? I do think it hurts, more below (also, this ist just what  *I* think, without any proof!)
Please note that in most cases it is trivial to detect whether traffic  comes through the Tor-network or not. So, if you use the standard user  agent provided by Torbutton, you can be identified to be "someone who  uses Tor and Torbutton between version x and y" (those two versions  are the versions that set that specific user agent). So when you  change the reported user agent frequently, does that mean that your  anonymity gets better? No, it doesn't! Now, you're a user who uses Tor  and Torbutton and also uses the user agent toggling script - a lot  less people are going to use that, until the new version is widely  adopted, which takes time. Also, when the user agent changes on a  website that you logged
onto, they are going to link the two. Again, the above is just what I  think of the problem, nothing based on research!
See above why there are only two choices, really onle a browser plugin  as it should work with https-traffic as well.
I hope I have given you something to think about, and maybe, when some  research shows it is worthwhile, it will be implemented in Torbutton -  but someone has to sort out the facts, first

I don't have much to say to that, except that you stick out as a Tor  user because your request came through a tor server. The list of tor  servers is publicly accessible (which is necessary by design) and even  if you don't spoof anything you're still not the regular Charlie  Brown. You need to "blend in" with the other Tor users, as you cannot  blend in with anyone on the planet!

@_subject: Proposal: Tor User Agent Carousel (TUAC) 
I don't want to spam the list, but I think it's remarkable how you  still don't acknowledge that it doesn't help to tell websites you have  plugins enabled... They will for example test for JS, and if it  doesn't work, they already know something. Then they'll put an applet  or Flash up - that doesn't connect back - wow, they figured out you're  a Tor user.
also, this will hurt the general user experience - websites that  detect you don't have JS enabled might direct you to a page that  doesn't use it, while what you see else is totally useless. So I don't  think this would become the default, which means again you don't only  stick out because you're a Tor user, but also because you use a  feature few others don't use.
But I will not respond until someone else has had the chance to reply  and say what they think.

@_subject: .onion sites fail to load with: (waiting for rendezvous desc) 
after reading this I went ahead and with the help of Phobos compiled  an installed trunk.
Nope, that was me :)
I'd like to help
I had a somewhat strange behaviour. I was able to connect to the  example hidden service, but not the v2 test service. trying to access  the v2 test service, I got the message "[Notice] Tried for 120  seconds to get a connection to [scrubbed]:80. Giving up. (waiting for  rendezvous desc)" a bit later, I could access the v2 test page  without a problem, but core.onion still throws the above error  message. The strange thing is that a made-up onion address gives a  different error message in the log:
Trying to access  (almost the same as a  above, but changed one letter) I get a "[Notice] Closing stream for  '[scrubbed].onion': hidden service is unavailable (try again later)."  in the logs :)
Same here, it does not matter how long Tor has been running
unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be the problem :(

@_subject: .onion sites fail to load with: (waiting for rendezvous desc) 
I just compiled and testet the new version. Using this, I was able to  contact core.onion, the v2 descriptor testpage and the example hidden  service. On core.onion, I clicked a few random links. Most were not  working, but in the logs, the error message is different - I get  "[Notice] Closing stream for '[scrubbed].onion': hidden service is  unavailable (try again later)." which I guess means that the service  is down. Also, I got a few "[Notice] Tried for 120 seconds to get a  connection to [scrubbed]:80. Giving up. (waiting for circuit)"
  and "[Notice] Rend stream is 120 seconds late. Giving up on address  '[scrubbed].onion'." in my logs.
I hope this can help you

Hi Olaf,
there's a change in r13626 that hopefully fixes your problem. Maybe  you could try and run that version to see if your problem disappears.

Please consider this:
By using Tor only for "critical" activities, you allow anyone who  successfully sniffes any traffic to have a high chance to intercept  something interesting. The more "innocent" traffic flows over the Tor  network, the better for those who really need the protection it

It might be a good idea to join the  channel on irc.oftc.net: 6667. There, your ideas can be discussed and you may get direct  feedback. In any case, write documentation about how you do your tests  and I'm sure the main devs will love to send you feedback.

@_subject: Problems with irc because of tor? 
Unfortunately, some service providers choose to not accept Tor users as part of their userbase and block connections from exit nodes. To resolve your freenode problem you can either use the hidden service, as the error message states, or you must disallow exiting to freenode's IRC ports so they can see that the connection is not coming from Tor, but rather from yourself.

Sorry I didn't make myself clear, he's not using Tor, freenode is (wrongly) thinking he's using Tor.
