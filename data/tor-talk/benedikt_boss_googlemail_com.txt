@_subject: GSoC project: Fuzzing the Tor Network 
Hello Karster, Johannes and everyone :)
My Name is Benedikt Boss, student of the HS-Karlsruhe, Germany. My Project is about developing a framework to run fuzz tests
against the Tor protocols to detect security relevant bugs in the code.
If you have any ideas what you would have included into this project you can
mail me or contact me on the tor irc-channel.
