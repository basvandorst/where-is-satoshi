hey list,

i've got a problem: tor dont starts. i am a Mac user (10.4.10 with a  macbook, first generaion).
i just downloaded this tor/vidalia bundle:  after the installation, vidalia runs fine, but tor is not able to  build a circuit. there are no tor servers available in the list of  My Mac runs behind a linksys router, but this is not the prooblem: i  also tryed to run tor directely behind the dsl-modem.
I've not so mutch knowledge in this topic, so i ask you, wether you  have some ideas, why tor dont runs here on my notebook. aah, i forgot  to say, that i want to user tor from germany (thats where im  from.. ..and thats why my english is soo bad ^^)

thanks a lot for your fast responses!
tor now work pretty fine. but only local on my macbook.
now i had the idea to run tor and privoxy on my little "home-server"  also as a tor-server.
but for this i have some questions: everytime i use the internet, i  use the internet-connection from my server via OpenVPN. so isn't it  is very easy to run tor/privoxy on my server? then i could use the  tor network from my computers in my home LAN and i could use it over  vpn. but here is the question: what changes are needed for this?
the ip of my server in the LAN is 192.168.2.100 and the vpn server  adress is 10.66.66.1.
but before configuring tor and privoxy, i had a problem with  installing privoxy ( i know, this is the tor-mailing list, but maybe  someone want to help me with my privoxy installation problems).
i had privoxy running on my server, but somehow i didnt worked  anymore. so now, several times later i wanted to reinstall privoxy.  first i releted erverything related to privoxy (and tor) -->  /etc/ tor/ /etc/privoxy/ /etc/torrc.conf
and when i want to reinstall tor an privoxy i get:
i hope you understand this german/english mix ;)
so what do i have to do, when i want to run privoxy?
