It is 9050 not 5090.  Unless you just had a typo.

Sorry to be such a nudnick.
I learned about tor from the NewsForge article and
thought I would give it a whirl. I downloaded the
most recent version of tor (0.1.0.2-rc) and
libevent (1.0b when I did it) and had no problem
compiling both as described in the distributions.
Tor runs from a user account and prints the
message "Tor has successfully...".
Configured Firefox (dropped back and tried Mozilla
also) to use a 'manual poxy configuration', to use
a SOCKS v4 proxy (also tried v5) and added
'localhost'  to the Socks Host field and 5090 to
the Socks Host Port field. Firefox/Mozilla both
return a message to the effect that the requested
page contains no data. Tor (in tor log level info)
gives no inidcation that the browser is attempting
to connect to the socks tunnel. Oh yeah,
'localhost, 127.0.0.1' are entered in the no proxy
for field of Firefox/Mozilla (tried without these
So, can someone tell me what silly think I
overlooked so that I can slink feeling stupid?

@_subject: TOR Server Idea 
I would like to ensure that everyone in the house is using TOR for routine surfing.  What I am thinking is that I could use an old PC with two ethernet ports and place it between the home router and the cable modem.  This would ensure that all users are randomized and would prevent me from having to check their PCs to be sure they didnt goof something up.  Additionally, I wouldnt need to constantly update all of them with the latest version of TOR.  Has anyone ever done something like this?

Can you give me some more information on how you did that?   You can send direct to me so we dont tie up the board.

@_subject: TOR Park Exit Node Question 
Having loaded and tested TORPARK on a USB it seems that both myself and another person that I gave one to are having similar results.  We are nearly exclusively being routed out of an exit node in The Netherlands.    I have checked the TORRC file and cannot be see any reason why it would be giving preferential treatment to the .nl exit router.  Has anyone else had a similar experience?
