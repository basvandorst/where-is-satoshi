@_subject: [tor-talk] thttp and php 
I set up a hidden server on my centos 6 machine. Using tor and thttp. I can't seem to get php working though and it seems the web server doesn't allow this. From what I read it isn't recommended to use apache as it appears to be difficult to hide the machine. Can someone point me in a direction to create a hidden service that is safe and is PHP capable?
