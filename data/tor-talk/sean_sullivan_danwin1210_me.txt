@_subject: [tor-talk] I don't understand two things about the node 'freja'. 
Dear Roger,
I did wonder if the "about" screen was always served but I'll note that
when I tried to load TBB with a non-exit node, I never got as far as the
"about" screen.
The only reason I'm interested in "freja" is because I saw it's IP was the
last login to one of my accounts. I checked the IP with WHOIS and got
concerned. Then I checked "torstatus" and was relived that it was a Tor
node. Then I got confused because it wasn't an exit node.
My point is that the IP of "freja" was the last login. So, unless there's
a scenario I haven't thought of, surely it must at some point on Tuesday
have been an exit node? Is there a way to check this?

Just to add to my last comment, I'm asking:
Is there a way for a non-exit node to (in some form) be recorded as the
login IP? "Freja" is a "fast" and "guard" router (among other flags -

============================== START ==============================
I have questions about the Tor node ?freja?.
First, according to  the node is at
194.88.143.66 which is in Italy. Yet WHOIS says the addresses
194.88.142.0-194.88.143.255 are in Pune, India. The last IP from a
?traceroute? is 81.25.202.165 and 81.25.202.128-81.25.202.255 is in ?IT?
(Italy) which suggests that  is correct.
Why would WHOIS inaccurately (I think) say the IP is in India?
Second, according to  ?freja? is not an exit
node. But if you use...
StrictNodes 1
ExitNodes freja
...then TBB will load the purple introductory screen ?Explore. Privately.?
(I tried with other non-exit nodes and TBB typically gets stuck on
?Requesting Relay Information? and never loads the purple screen).
However, then ?freja? will not load any pages.
So if it?s not an exit node, why does the introductory screen load?
