Thanks for pursuing this!
1. Your arguments make good technical sense.
2. In fact, many endpoints have already enabled those ports without
experiencing problems.
3. Many of us routinely handle our ssl email accounts via TOR, and your
proposal (open them by default) would help spread the load, as well as
reasonably expanding the default functionality of TOR.
Thanks Again!
(p.s. this post is being sent via ssl GMAIL, which will include the "posting host" when using smtps. My posting host will be a TOR exit node :-) )

The encrypted connection occurs before the smtp handshake.
IP/host info is not compromised, this is not an issue.
TOR guidelines are clear.
Don't use active content; Do use encrypted protocols.
(Now it will be the case that some users do NOT use email encryption - they are lost anyway!)

AH!.... we were talking about two different things. :-(
I was referring to third-parties being unable to sniff your email contents or your host address within an SSL/SMTP transaction via TOR. You're talking about withholding information from the mail server itself (e.g. you're on the road with a laptop, and don't want to leave records of where you were as you sent your messages).
And indeed, you raise an interesting point!
FWICT, different clients put different information into that HELO. Even a common client such as TBird puts different info. in Mac OS's (unique registration information) than it does in Windows (IPA octet).
- Having the option to configure what goes into this field may be a basis for selecting one's email client.
- Guess it's time to sniff some SMTP connections, and if I become irritated enough, tweak the source code and recompile my client; hexedit my client; change clients; or install a proxy or server. (sigh)

@_subject: browser footprint 
Thanks for posting this; I think it is an important topic.
1. ISTM that one should go out to some of the statistics sites and
determine what the most frequently occurring "prints" actually are.
For user agents, there are many statistic sites; e.g.:
FWICT, the most frequently occuring general User Agent is one of these:
Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1)
I'd then find out what the typical (American English) windows I.E.
browser puts out for charsets and encodings, and use that.
(I do not believe that content type  */* is used by many browsers; nor
does gzip,deflate appear for HTTP_ACCEPT_CODING)
2. I agree that TOR would be the logical place to incorporate an
optional sanitizing routine that makes all browsers look the same. It is
likely that some folks will complain that it'll break certain features -
fine, they don't have to use it. But for most of TOR browser useage, it'd work fine.
If doing this in TOR is not practical or too far off, TOR could at least
officially recommend the replacement signatures that most users could
apply using our own devices (e.g. tweaking polipo, using privoxy,
proximitron, etc.).
It seems to me that if we wanted to approach TOR on this:
a. the first step would be to determine what the browser headers should be.
b. the second step would be to code and test a patch for TOR that
replaces individual headers with the standard headers, and deletes
extraneous stuff.
c. Present the recommendations and code patch.
If you are in contact with JonDoe, you might ask them why they chose the signatures they did
(p.s. Suggest you retitle this topic to "browser fingerprints" or "browser signatures". "footprints" typically refer to the size and overhead of an application)

This would be used only from open, WIFI hotspots while I'm on the road. I'm typically gone for two to three weeks, and  the computer would be home unattended.

Thanks.... Good point.
My present setup (MX) uses SSH to connect client to host; it tunnels its
mx protocol within SSH.
(FWIW, Because some hotspots limit one to 80/443, my host has sshd
listening on 443, and I connect encrypted to it. (I presume that only
the most sophisticated DPI could discern that I'm using SSH instead of
HTTPS :-) ))
This actually creates another question (not to be argumentative :-) ).
Given that there is no exit node, would an OnionCat to OnionCat
connection over TOR need to be encrypted? Is it plain-text anywhere
along the line?
(This would be a consideration, given SSH is tcp and TOR is tcp, and I
might get the tcp over tcp tunnel ( "TCP meltdown" ) timing conflict, it   might be good to send the MX/VNC protocol unencrypted)

I'd like to take it with me to Canada, and if some overzealous border guard wants to look at, copy, or confiscate it..... go ahead; there will be no financial or personal information onboard to be compromised through sloppy handling by govt. Part of this equation is that the laptop is an underpowered "sub".
So the communications overhead placed on the little laptop becomes a
consideration. FWIW, I plan on comparing a few alternatives for
1. NX/SSH direct with port-knocking (using
 to unhide the otherwise
firewall-hidden SSH service port).      This is the current setup.
2. NX/SSH via OnionCat with port-knocking;
3. NX via OnionCat without encryption beyond that provided by TOR hidden-service to hidden-service; fwknop hiding the SSH service port from script-kiddies cruising the OC nodes (Bernhard's concern).
Obviously, I'm hoping that alternative 2 proves viable; SCAR's
suggestion of a MIM possibility with alt. 3, though it appears remote, seems also quite possible and is indeed disconcerting.

Guess I'm thinking along the line of a PC that has a TOR relay and bridge (both) that's being logged by its ISP.
If all inbound and outbound TOR circuits were port 443, all the ISP would log is a bewildering collection of inbound, SSL-encrypted connections to 443, and  outbound, SSL-encrypted connections to 443 - hard to know if any given inbound is an entry-connection, or Likewise, outbound connections to 443 somewhere else might be TOR, or it might be the operator browsing his bank account.

@_subject: Does TOR use any non-ephemeral (non-DHE) ciphers? 
David Howe has been running some tests, and has discovered that in many cases, SSL transactions can be recorded, and decrypted by Wireshark after the fact - this because an ephemeral cipher was NOT chosen by the server; i.e. a cipher was chosen that does not provide "Perfect Forward Secrecy" . This ability of Wireshark provides a motivation to steal or subpoena private keys - which may awaken governmental interest in TOR private keys!?
So this begs the questions:
Does TOR use any non-ephemeral (non-DHE) ciphers?
The following is from David Howe's 9/23/08 posting in GRC's "cryptography" newsgroup:
"Apache 2.2 webserver, default configuration
XCA generated self signed webserver cert
Internet explorer (versions 6,7,8beta)
Firefox (versions 2.x,3.x)
Wireshark 1.0.3
Testing: for each session, a Wireshark capture was created *without*
access to the key. Fresh instance of Wireshark each capture. After all
captures are made, they are copied to another machine where Wireshark is
configured with the private key, to examine the packets.
IE (all versions) readable
FF (both versions) unreadable (error in dissector log)
After further analysis, it appears that the apache webserver takes the
first suitable match from the list of offered cryptographic suites, not
an abstract "Best" match.
In the case of IE, the first match is for TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 which
has no DHE (perfect forward secrecy) component. in FF, the first match
is for TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA which DOES have a PFS component.
Further testing is required, first to see if I can configure Apache to
give preference to DHE enabled solutions, and second to see what the
default behaviour of IIS is. I will update this post once I have more

@_subject: Google's Chrome Web Browser and Tor 
ISTM this thing is more a web 2.0 portal than a browser; it is conceived and designed first and foremost to make user access of Google online services smooth, slick, (and advertisement laden). Its secondary function as a good browser simply allows most users to have only one browser active.
Given it is OpenBSD Open source, if it proves to be a good design (interesting for sure) with potential to become a good privacy browser, and proves to have the very-quick JS engine that some claim, it might be "forked" at some point.
The first thing the sibling would hopefully do is remove the "unique application number" business (see below); the second would be all phone-home features (see below).
Even if it doesn't become officially forked, if it becomes a good package (say, 6 months from now after intense support and development), there will likely be patch files and/or "enthusiast" versions available.
Certainly Linux/TOR users will "repair" the userid business before compiling it (or with a hex editor), and firewall-off any connection with home base.
Thankfully, Opera with plugins removed is already an extremely quick, lightweight, secure, general-purpose TOR and non-TOR browser; FireFox with extensions well-addresses "expanded features", so dual-browser users can comfortably wait for chrome to mature.
"When you type URLs or queries in the address bar, the letters you type
are sent to Google so the Suggest feature can automatically recommend
terms or URLs you may be looking for. If you choose to share usage
statistics with Google and you accept a suggested query or URL, Google
Chrome will send that information to Google as well. You can disable
this feature as explained here.
If you navigate to a URL that does not exist, Google Chrome may send the
URL to Google so we can help you find the URL you were looking for. You
can disable this feature as explained here.
Google Chrome's SafeBrowsing feature periodically contacts Google's
servers to download the most recent list of known phishing and malware
sites. In addition, when you visit a site that we think could be a
phishing or malware site, your browser will send Google a hashed,
partial copy of the site's URL so that we can send more information
about the risky URL. Google cannot determine the real URL you are
visiting from this information. More information about how this works is
Your copy of Google Chrome includes one or more unique application
numbers. These numbers and information about your installation of the
browser (e.g., version number, language) will be sent to Google when you
first install and use it and when Google Chrome automatically checks for
updates.  If you choose to send usage statistics and crash reports to
Google, the browser will send us this information along with a unique
application number as well.  Crash reports can contain information from
files, applications and services that were running at the time of a
malfunction.   We use crash reports to diagnose and try to fix any
problems with the browser."

approach. (I presume that you want a number of VMs - each containing
sensitive or vulnerable applications)

My initial presumption on this question is to approach desktop use as
one does chroot jails:
- use X clients to provide desktop windowed use of X-applications
on the VMs (e.g. Firefox/TB/etc.)
- use SSH to transfer data, and if necessary, root up to manipulate
stuff within the VMs. Alternatively, maintain the VMs separately, and
copy the "virgin" VM into memory where they are started (this is how I
run my chroot jails).
(I suppose one could use VNC/SSH)
either way, one would have some very restrictive firewalls/packet filters.
Presuming that the above applies to any VM application, do you know if
any of the current crop are most breakout proof? If that hasn't been
determined (by the folks who track vulnerabilities - e.g. securityfocus,
sans, etc.), is there a variety of VM that is known to be weak?
Nah...... I'd keep them separate, and communicate through networking -
likely X and SSH.
understood; agreed.
I'd assume that the host/or/primary OS would SSH into a guest, using an
unprivileged account, and simply copy/move files via ssh. The SSH client
on the host/primary could be easily jailed; the connection could be
generally kept open.
(like this?   (p.s. IIRC, it is
encrypted with loop-aes))
What I'm getting at in this question is the ability of root to gain
information about the host - ideally the VM doesn't know anything about
the host, or the real world in which the host/hypervisor is running.
IIRC QEMU created a hardware emulation layer, in which you could tell
the guest OS all sorts of lies :-)
Here is where I'd *guess* that a hypervisor would be the way to go - I
haven't looked into it
Moka5 appears to be a VNC client within a VM client.
Using X, I right-click:copy the email link in the mail client Jail/VM,
and then middle click the browser that is in the "browser" Jail/VM.
On my box, they don't (B-jail and E-jail).
I looked into this once, and IIRC there is a configuration setup using X
that would transfer TB http selection actions to FF via the window; but
I'm lazy and I don't mind pasting links.
You just summarized what I attempted to describe above.
A single instance - it would make timing attacks more difficult.
Don't know how they'd do that without access to the control port.
The only access to the control port, IMHO, would come from the
primary/host. TBH, I don't use the control port for anything, other than
infrequently bringing up vidallia - then it is curiosity
Thanks for the thoughtful response.
Are there any other newsgroups or webgroups that are focused on VMs, and
that might have some heavy-duty insight into all of this?

1. Separate, individual (GRSecurity-hardened) jails on Linux for
Thunderbird, Opera, and TOR itself.
2. Opera connects to TOR via polipo - which is jailed in a "common"
jail; and Thunderbird connects to tor via Socat - which is also jailed
in that common jail (as are lftp and filezilla, which occasionally use
TOR, or go direct).
I jail TOR because it may be attacked directly from the WAN; I
separately jail the tools connecting to TOR (socat and polipo) because
they occasionally connect to the WAN directly. Because they are
highly targeted, I figure that browsers and mail clients ought to be
individually jailed as a general principle.
Do FreeBSD jails automatically provide a different address (e.g.
127.0.0.2)? If so, you may need to check the proxy addresses.

Don't know what a transparent proxy is. from wikipedia: "Transparent and
non-transparent proxy server
The term "transparent proxy" is most often used incorrectly to mean
"intercepting proxy" (because the client does not need to configure a
proxy and cannot directly detect that its requests are being proxied).
Transparent proxies can be implemented using Cisco's WCCP (Web Cache
Control Protocol). This proprietary protocol resides on the router and
is configured from the cache, allowing the cache to determine what ports
and traffic is sent to it via transparent redirection from the router.
This redirection can occur in one of two ways: GRE Tunneling (OSI Layer
3) or MAC rewrites (OSI Layer 2).
However, RFC 2616 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1) offers
different definitions:
"A 'transparent proxy' is a proxy that does not modify the request or
response beyond what is required for proxy authentication and
"A 'non-transparent proxy' is a proxy that modifies the request or
response in order to provide some added service to the user agent, such
as group annotation services, media type transformation, protocol
reduction, or anonymity filtering".

Any and ALL suggests a machine that allows only HTTP/S activity to/from

An iptables script or Windows firewall could do that. Presumably a
second script would be invoked for normal operation.
Alternatively, VMs dedicated to TOR applications could achieve your
goal, plus protect your box if something grabs your e.g. browser and

Yes.   Feed the VM either random, or standardized (every TOR VM has the
same "fingerprint") data.
As mentioned earlier, a firewall (in this case within the VM) can block
all connections, except between TOR and TOR entry modes; the VM
insulates any unique user info from a roving plugin/extension. The VM
also protects the host, should the application within be compromised
(e.g. memory attack).
JAVA is capable of more identity-revealing mischief than JS; within a VM
you could safely run even JAVA.

- FWIW, I run a quick MD5 hash check on the boot partition as part of my boot up. Quick and easy; again, IDS, not IPS.

Agreed; first of all TOR users should look the same..........
1. FWICT, the TORBUTTON obfuscation occurs only on the User Agent
response. To make us look the same, ISTM the HTTP_ACCEPT Headers should
also be standardized.
Perhaps all of the fields tested by panopticlick could be standardized -
reporting that JS is active even if it isn't (or vice versa)? Obviously
there will be additional tests beyond those of panopticlick.
2. Given it is the goal for all TOR users to look the same, there
seems a parallel argument for all TOR users to also be as
indistinguishable as possible from the dominant other on the net (I.E.
7 on XP?) - just in case some signature collector doesn't correlate with
the tor exit, but can tell we were TOR because we bare the TORBUTTON
It just seems to me that the panopticlick signature trick is now out of
the bag, and it will become widely implemented. Best would be for ALL
browsers to appear the same and be indistinguishable.

@_subject: browser fingerprinting - panopticlick 
Agreed; first of all TOR users should look the same..........
1. FWICT, the TORBUTTON obfuscation occurs only on the User Agent
response. To make us look the same, ISTM the HTTP_ACCEPT Headers should
also be standardized.
Perhaps all of the fields tested by panopticlick could be standardized -
reporting that JS is active even if it isn't (or vice versa)? Obviously
there will be additional tests beyond those of panopticlick.
2. Given it is the goal for all TOR users to look the same, there
seems a parallel argument for all TOR users to also be as
indistinguishable as possible from the dominant other on the net (I.E.
7 on XP?) - just in case some signature collector doesn't correlate with
the tor exit, but can tell we were TOR because we bare the TORBUTTON
It just seems to me that the panopticlick signature trick is now out of
the bag, and it will become widely implemented. Best would be for ALL
browsers to appear the same and be indistinguishable.

Dang!   This makes a lot of sense! A fast, "throwaway" browser, quickly
(instantly?) reloaded in a virgin state - as opposed to the traditional
approach of a heavily-protected Firefox remaining in memory for a while.
As you know, on Linux one simply QEMU/KVMs the .iso on storage; dead easy.
I'd guess there is reluctance to try it, as many believe that Google is
satan and fear that there is home-phoning to the "cloud" going on with
Chromium. Of course, running it in a well-firewalled, standardized VM
may render that information meaningless, and any reporting outside of
TOR impossible.
Got a copy; gonna give it a try!
(FWIW, Have had good luck with a hardened-Gentoo FF QEMU/KVM VM, except
for graphics which suck. Once they/I figure out how to get GPU
pass-through, I'll do routine browsing - including flash/silverlight
streaming - in it. IIUC chromium does html5 video; will see if I can
get some html5 pass-through video streaming out of your .iso (though,
obviously, not through TOR.)

Thank You tor-readme.spamt.net, for your generous contribution to tor!!!
What, specifically, are they tracking to your IP? This unspecific
complaint could be anything from an innocent series of pings, to an out
and out stream from metasploit!?
Guess I'd politely tell server4you, with a copy to shadowserver, that
you want to accommodate shadowserver; that they've been unresponsive;
and that you'll need specific information to fix the problem. Once you
have that info, you may need only block specific ports at shadowserver.

Given that tor-readme.spamt.net does not allow IRC, this may indeed be a
false alarm. "Details" are necessary to understand what may, or may not
have happened!
Perhaps a gentle offensive would be appropriate in this situation!? e.g.
-  A letter to server4you (cc to shadow) re-emphasing tor's commitment
to legitimate use, and educating them about "automated and
often-incorrect abuse reports!? The objective of this gentle offensive
would be to add server4you to that list of ISPs that ignores
shadowserver alarms.
This begs the question, does anyone have a well-written letter and/or
links to articles documenting honey-pot/shadowserver false positives?
Perhaps a well-constructed letter would be something that could be
maintained at the TOR home page; available to other nodes in similar
(Also, perhaps TOR should additionally start documenting cases of false
positives - it may become very useful when the next political onslaught
against anonymity becomes active.)

@_subject: Torlock - a simple script to prevent outgoing packets from  bypassing 
I can't quite tell; I'm guessing that JanusVM uses a VPN(TUN/TAP) to redirect all host packets to the VM - thereby blocking any "loose" packets? (any non-TOR interaction with the ISP - which may be a hotspot)?
Nice!  Thank You

@_subject: [tor-talk] Downloading Firefox add-ons trough Tor. Safe? 
Given the add-ons are updated via SSL, it is reasonably safe as long as
you check your certs for possible MIM attack using a "low integrity" CA.
Some folks will delete all of the authorities distributed with Firefox
and Thunderbird, and then add certs one at a time - validating each.
This is pretty easy with Thunderbird (only a few mail accounts); a PITA
for FF.
Another promising - not perfected for TB - way is using Certificate
Patrol. It will popup and warn you if the cert (e.g. for
https//addons.mozilla.org) has mysteriously changed.

One downside may be that those unaware of your test will be confused!?
Frankly I think it's a great idea - apply a little stress test - and
I'll definitely run a test via blutmagie..... thank you!

FWIW IPv6 presently appears to resolve the status quicker than IPv4. :-)
As you likely know, HTTPS IPv4 works fine; HTTPS IPv6 does not.

@_subject: [tor-talk] New methods / research to detect add-ons? 
Perhaps one could identify the two or three extensions that might be added (e.g. addblock plus, csfire, flashgot, etc.) and study  with/without the extensions. This could provide the (superficial?) quantification of the effects of the various extensions that you seek. (obviously do this in temporary VMs, or reinstall a "clean" copy after testing)
