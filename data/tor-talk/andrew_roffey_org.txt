I was under the impression that the above link was the old one and
hasn't worked for some time, and this one is the newer link (but doesn't
appear to be working either):

@_subject: [tor-talk] Size of TBB 
I just received a notification to upgrade from 3.6.6 to 4.0. Big thanks
to the Tor developers for their hard work.
I noticed that the latest version is significantly larger, at 42MB,
compared to 3.6.6 which was 30MB.
Does anyone know why Firefox 31 is so much bigger than 24? Does it ever
stop growing???

Except that some of us don't believe privacy rights are just a
self-defence, but should be protected at a higher level. I think that
human rights should apply to everyone, not just to people that are
knowledgeable on the subject.

Then GnuPG signatures would perhaps be more appropriate in this instance?

This isn't intended to answer the question, but I've noticed the
signature isn't shown very prominently on the download page, at least
compared to other websites such as the Apache Tomcat page:
(from: HTTPS is, in theory, a good idea on downloads considering a lot of users
won't bother with signatures (although GnuPG signatures are
nice as well).
The main problems with HTTPS (from a hosting perspective) are that:
 - it is much more resource intensive than plain HTTP (especially on
   servers hosting large files);
 - it more or less rules out using third-party mirrors unless you can
   trust them because integrity is provided per-connection rather than
   per-file; and
 - there is a cost of obtaining HTTPS signatures.
Also consider the security of the CA model and the probable likelihood
that at least one of the hundreds of the authorities has been
compromised and could be used to issue fraudulent certificates to MITM
high value targets.
tl;dr: anyone with enough time, money and resources should definitely
consider deploying HTTPS, preferably alongside GnuPG signatures for the

I don't suppose one could purchase a dummy domain with Namecheap and
then ask them to sign a certificate for the real domain (with another
provider)? I suspect not, but please correct me if I'm wrong.
Except for the few big names, most domain providers do not provide
inexpensive certificates so the point is not invalid (yet). I don't
think changing domain providers to bundle the cost is a reasonable
solution to the high costs of certificates.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor -> VPN  Clarification 
It is perhaps better described as Tor over VPN and vice-versa.
I believe this is Tor over VPN which is safe, similar to using a proxy
or Tor bridge to connect to the Tor network.
If you wanted to be pseudonymous to your VPN then this would enable it,
although you would not be anonymous on the internet, only pseudonymous
at most. It is prone to unmasking if you connect your personal
information to the VPN at any time.
Hope that helps!
