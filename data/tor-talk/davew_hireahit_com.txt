@_subject: [tor-talk] [tor-dev] Porting Tor Browser to the BSDs 
As I understand it, this isn't a threat that they are addressing. Instead, they're trying to ensure that such access doesn't happen in the first place. The attack surface is inherently small since you don't run browsers or applications on the gateway itself, so you need to find a specific vulnerability in the gateway itself AND you need to find a way to exploit it.
By splitting the gateway and workstation, you can run less-safe code on the workstation, a browser level exploit wouldn't automatically be able to violate your privacy without a second vulnerability on the gateway itself since the code on the workstation doesn't have the information needed in the first place. On Tails, you have to assume that the software you're running isn't actively trying to thwart you, which may not be the case since browsers often have vulnerabilities.
It's not perfect, but it would seem to dramatically raise the bar since a browser based exploit alone is no longer sufficient to unmask a user like with TBB, and potentially with Tails.
At least to me, Whonix seems to be a natural "next step" beyond Tails if you want to ensure that an entire workstation is protected even if the workstation itself has compromises. It's overkill for many Tails users, and has tradeoffs since the gateway and workstation are split (introducing potential attack surfaces between the two) just as Tails itself is probably overkill for many TBB users.
But I might be way off.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Best devices to boot Tails off of? 
In theory, it shouldn't matter. In practice, well, things are possibly more complicated if an attack were targeted at Tails in particular.
At least in theory, most any flash drive should work. But it's dependent on the drive, BIOS/UEFI and it's configuration, whether it passes off control of the USB drive properly, etc. But most modern hardware should handle this just fine; I haven't personally run into a non-bootable USB disk or motherboard in quite some time.
But that's not to say you won't, or that your hardware is configured appropriately for your media.
Safest, probably. At least in theory, once you finalize optical media, it should be truly read-only, and the worst that could happen is that bits could be written (which would corrupt the disk-level checksums, destroying the disk)
I wouldn't totally trust flash media to be read-only, even if it has a physical switch as these could easily be poorly implemented and allow a compromised OS to persist between reboots.
Yes, you shouldn't trust any checksum or other verification from the compromised device itself.
(All "in my opinion",  as a lay-person, I have no specific knowledge of Tails specific issues)

I doubt there are many people who are truly competent to check the source. You don't just need a programmer who checks to make sure the code does what they expect, but also that there aren't any corner cases where something does leak, just a little.
To be secure, one must also check the entirety of the Firefox source, since Firefox could easily have some behaviour which intentionally leaks when Tor is active (and possibly only when other conditions are met, to reduce the odds of anyone who isn't a target from observing any unexpected behaviour)

And if you do clear this list regularly, Privacy Badger is useless; it functions by learning which sites are legitimate and which are potentially tracking you based on the fact that by their nature, trackers are resources loading from a consistent location into various unrelated sites using cookies that are potentially uniquely identifying.
Resetting it's history leaves you vulnerable to tracking until it has re-learned your behaviour, by which time you're vulnerable to It might be possible to take the same concept and democratize it in some fashion that would share the heuristically learned data between users, such that users aren't individually fingerprintable (while uses of Privacy Badger itself would become more obvious), but then you have the problem of building a whitelist for resources that are actually useful, and potential malfeasance on the part of whitelist submissions, as well as the efforts to manage the whitelist. Without a whitelist, it will eventually break sites, and if you whitelist yourself, you again generate a fingerprint.
As much as I love Privacy Badger in general, I don't see how it can fit into the Tor model.

Sure, but this is probably just a case of using too blunt an instrument; they likely just classified "Tor" (all of it, including websites) as an unacceptable product.
Expecting mid-level management to understand the finer points of what Tor is, how it works, or the difference between the "website" and "the service" and "the protocol" isn't realistic in a world where usually the concept of a site, service and protocol are all one and the same.

@_subject: [tor-talk] VPN/TOR Router 
It occurs to me that such a computer wouldn't *know* your real IP to share, it would only see it's local IP, and the only IP it would learn as an external IP is that of the Tor exit node.
However, the other anonymity related concerns would definitely apply. Things like browser identification, cookies and other data that are used within Tor and outside of Tor and similar would be huge problems. If your goal is to be anonymous, this is obviously a major problem, but not everyone needs anonymity, sometimes it's desirable and sufficient to encrypt and protect your traffic from the first hop. In this type of environment, implementing Tor at the network level would have a number of advantages, including reducing the odds of certain types of leakage while still allowing many/most applications to function without further While I wouldn't necessarily suggest using Tor at the router level for all users, for at least some use cases, it probably makes a lot of sense to consider this as an option.

I'd tend to agree; if you control the endpoint, set it up as a hidden service rather than having Tor exit node involved at all.
While running hidden services alongside non-hidden services introduces some risks, most of these are less significant when connecting to SSH on a server that you control.

Understood. But the suggestion is that you SHOULD run a hidden server to listen for SSH connections over Tor as this will be far more reliable and secure than having to rely on an exit node.
The rest of the server doesn't need to be a hidden server, and SSH can still listen as both a Tor hidden server and a regular public server, but by making it a hidden server within Tor, you remove one of the major risk factors of using Tor: The exit node.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Yelp blocking Tor users from viewing entire site 
I think that Craigslist is a bit different, the ultimate goal is for local people to meet in real life, but they have a very high rate of spammers and abuse, most of which is non-local. Dealing with spam has been a massive problem for Craigslist, and one of the things that has helped is to geolocate users when posting and use that to help prevent More importantly though, when Craigslist identifies you're doing something abusive, they don't always tell you. Your posts will appear to post, will be visible to you and by number, but not to users who search. Given that real posts don't show up instantly either, this works well because spammers don't get feedback and therefore can't work around the system as easily, but it creates an extremely negative user experience for legitimate users who share an IP with a spammer as you will think everything is working, but your ad never makes it and you feel like you're being ignored.
I'm not sure that blocking Tor is the best approach, but it probably makes sense from a user experience perspective since Tor nodes would quickly get flagged for abuse if they weren't blocked outright.
I am a bit mixed about whether reducing anonymity is a good thing or not for a site that is ultimately centered around people interacting in

I'm not so sure that that would work particularly well, humans rarely live in datacenters, and it's tough to make cloud IPs look and act the same as residential IPs, especially when other IPs in the same /24 (or larger) are owned by different customers. User behaviour would also be quite different, and it would probably be difficult to mimic typical human patterns of usage while scraping enough information to be worthwhile before Craigslist pulls the plug.
Tor exit nodes, on the other hand, have a lot of human shields using them too, so it makes it a lot harder to narrow down a specific "bad actor" without also hitting actual users.
So while Tor isn't necessary an ideal choice here, it has some advantages over dynamically allocating and dropping cloud IPs.
Because they're actively hostile to creating a better user experience. Don't get me wrong, the fact that their website doesn't look like someone from marketing took a dump all over it is part of what is awesome about it, but still...

While true, the time*zone* is also mentioned, and timezones can be a more interesting kettle of proverbial fish. Timezone rules vary from region to region, and so upon observing the dates your DST rules apply, I might determine your country or geopolitical location more specifically then just a 1/24th slice of the planet (plus all those funky :30 zones)
More complicated is when you travel, if you update the timezone on your machine, this information is leaked too, so over time, your timezone information may actually reveal your travel to a very broad degree. Chances are that it would only take a very small number of cross-timezone trips for a gov't actor to correlate your timezone shifts with your travel itinerary, assuming such information is made available now or in the future.
For most people, it's probably not a major risk, but for those who's livelihood or freedom relies upon anonymity, this is just the sort of leak that Big Data can use.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Are webmail providers biased against Tor? 
The fact that you're constantly accessing Google from an otherwise totally clean and featureless browser itself is a fingerprint that Google could act upon, and "Tor exit node" could be treated as a "country" like any other. Even if they can't separate you from other Tor users, it's potentially just as significant as a fingerprint like "Accesses NY, NJ frequently from each of the four largest providers' dynamic IP ranges, and does not retain cookies"
However, the reality is that the rate of abuse from anonymous sources will naturally be much higher, and as a result, it does make sense to treat such connections with a higher level of suspicion.
A few weeks ago I ran a query against some servers logs which were fed from SMTP, POP3, IMAP and webmail authentication attempts against a DNSBL (torexit.dan.me.uk, I think?) that lists Tor exit nodes, there were tons of unsuccessful authentication attempts coming from Tor exit nodes, while there were zero successful authentication requests in the time period studied. Many of the IPs were doing obvious dictionary attacks, trying many thousands of attempts (with the IP itself being locked out completely after just a few minutes). Based on this limited analysis, it would make a lot of sense to block Tor completely since I don't have any legitimate traffic from Tor. Various other countries would meet this same criteria. However, I don't like to block this I'm sure Google's scale means that there are a lot more legitimate users Tor users than I have, but just the same, it's quite reasonable to treat Tor traffic with a higher level of suspicion -- It's not about bias against Tor, or against Tor users, or even a dislike of Tor, but rather, it's the fact that a higher percentage of abuse comes from Tor than from most other sources, even when you take the percentage of legitimate traffic into account. The fact that Tor, by it's privacy centric nature, makes it more difficult to use other fingerprinting techniques to sort out legitimate users means that good users get lumped in with the bad

If you'd quote properly instead of cutting the context, you'd note that I absolutely did not say I block Tor completely, nor was I suggesting doing so.
What I did say is that good users GET LUMPED IN WITH THE BAD simply because there's no way to tell them apart. That's the whole point of Tor, and TBB in particular.
That's the whole point -- Not all Tor users are abusive, but abusers tend toward Tor because of the fact that it provides anonymity and human shields in one package. That's just the nature of the game. The result is that connections from Tor will be treated with suspicion. For example, Google will put you through additional validation steps on a more regular basis since it can't tell if you are you, or you are some other Tor user who borrowed your password.

No, you can't just patch in a hardcoded window and screen size unless it reflects the actual viewport size.

More importantly, it won't even work, JavaScript can detect where wrapping happens, and some creative 1 pixel tall transparent images could detect the actual horizontal width by using varying widths.

Probably, but in my (limited) experience, it's either painfully slow or
a memory hog, or both. The overhead for a Windows 10 VM is surprisingly
small, and it's snappy and responsive.
Attacks to identify me and/or correlate my physical location or "real"
identity vs my tor identity aren't a threat model that worry me in my
circumstances, so this configuration is Good Enough for my purposes.
This is why god invented HTTPS and HTTPS Everywhere. I wish TBB didn't
block 1Password (although I understand why it does), as this would
reduce my exposure to various types of attacks. Also, I trust random Tor
nodes more than random wifi hotspots in tourist/traveler locations
(airports in particular, where you have gov't actors, the airport itself
and other users).
Having trivial access to hidden services is great too. Facebook is a
prime example, I have no practical need as I'm using my real identity,
not hiding anything, Facebook forces HTTPS (and I believe, pins their
certificates in HSTS lists?), and I discuss my approximate physical
location with people on Facebook. But it's likely harder to attack the
hidden service than the public HTTPS site, plus staying within the tor
network has benefits.
But, I want the output from Tor exit nodes to show more legitimate
traffic, so even for non-HS traffic, I feel that adding legitimate
traffic is a net good idea until/unless the tor network becomes
over-saturated or my traffic otherwise impedes a user with actual safety
or security needs. I would always yield to those users, as I am lucky
and privileged enough to not be one.I understand why the Cloudflares of
the world see a lot of abuse coming from tor, but I want to them to see

I like the idea in theory, but in practice in the case of Tor where all users are intentionally identical and any user can become a new user any time, the difference between "one free" and "all free" is clicking the "new identity" button (or more likely, just dumping cookies).
 From an abuse handling standpoint, it becomes nearly impossible to identify whether user is on their first "free" shot or not. Worse, this is a feature, not a bug.
The only real fix is to apply a cost to making the first-free, be it an account creation/login, captcha, or similar, which I think takes us full circle and defeats the point?
