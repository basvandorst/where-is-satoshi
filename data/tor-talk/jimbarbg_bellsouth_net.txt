@_subject: [tor-talk] Hiding IP address from my ISP 
?I was wondering if you know of?a program that will hide your ip from your isp (our local cable company) when downloading files from a torrent site like the pirates bay.se.

Thanks Badtik. I was up at the site k mentioned below, and there was a movie I wanted to view, I hit the stream option and here the other day I received an email from them. "We are writing as a courtesy to let you we received notification from copyright owner a person with access to your internet connection may be (unknowingly) participating in illegal file sharing or transfer activities that leaf to this complaint."
So I just did this one time but I don't ever want it to happen again if I can avoid it.
I know stay away, but they have good files there.

your ISP knows your IP anyway. They are the ones that assign the IP
address, though this is an automatic process.
With Tor you can visit the website, preferably with the
TorBrowserBundle, without your ISP being aware that you visit it.
A torrent site usually offers only .torrent files, which are tiny and
can be downloaded over Tor (with TBB), your specific example does not
even do that. There are no files to download (beside the website itself
with it's images).
Using a torrent client with Tor is not recommended as the client
probably leaks. Also it would add a constant, massive load to the Tor
network, which is not good for you and others.
Supposing your ISP dislikes Linux and you want to get a copy via
Bittorrent, without them noticing a VPN might be a solution. Your ISP
does not get aware of the websites you visit or where you download
anything from.

Thanks, I will look into I2P

For sharing movies and other large content anonymously, look into I2P
which was designed for such things. It is a kind of complement to Tor,
in that I2P transfers over UDP while Tor transfers over TCP.  It also
uses a different architecture. Further discussion of I2P would be
off-topic for this list, but you can check

I thought something was wrong or I was a total dummy, because everything I clicked didn't do anything.  Any other ideas before I admit defeat.  They have other than movies so really good software, but I am afraid I am being watched.  I guess I could change carriers and stay away from movies.   Sent from my HTC Inspire? 4G on AT&T

Thanks for the comment (I guess) but if you would have read
my first post you would have found out that I am not on a so called ?QUEST for
MOVIES? as you stated.? The first post
was I ran across the software and wanted to know if it would hide or mask my IP
from the sites or my ISP.? I gave
examples of where the tracking was noted.? And I had a few good suggestions like find a VPN somewhere, use another
site, or just stay off.? I never intended
for my post to appear as a QUEST as you called it, if so I am truly sorry because
it was never my intention. I am not just someone that was wanting stuff, I wanted to
learn how and why it happened and what can I do to prevent it, but I guess I gave
the wrong impression, I just felt like I could explain what happened and what I
was doing in order to get my point across.? If it appears this way then maybe this isn?t the site that I thought it
was, and I am truly sorry for any inconvenience this may have placed on you.

The ideas people here are going to give you regarding your
quest for 'movies' and 'really good software' will be to tell you
to try clicking youtube.com and something like freecode.com.
Yes, everyone is being watched and everything is broken
or breakable. Read more and use appropriately. Specific
questions about Tor under agnostic use cases would
be more typical material here.

Excellent, I totally understand your answer and I appreciate it very much.  Again I apologize for any miscommunication.  I was only wanting to protect my identity and NOT for illegal or immoral acts.  Thanks again.

Rephrasing, people usually don't like to answer questions
related to cracking safes with "here's a crowbar". Of course
if the question was said to be from the safe owner... I didn't
get that impression, but I've been wrong before and hereby
apologize if so.
There are indeed many examples of good software and movies
on piratebay that have open licenses for which sharing them
would thus not involve risk of violating copyright.
Tor doesn't really work too well for that since torrenting usually
requires inbound connections and its performance is far too low
for the typical user.
One last bit of info for your reading...

Sorry for the mistake,? I have checked my Tor-talk folder to see if i have an email from you (admin at txtfaker.com) and could not find it, in my inbox or my spam.? I thought it would be odd for me to ignor an email addressed from someone in the group.? Heck I read every one of the post I get, (of course I don't totally understand a lot of them but none the less).? Please send again.

Thanks for the offer but I do not have a service to advertise at this time.  I will keep it in mind.

I'll just send it from here, basically im after advertising on the actual
Tor Project website? Is this possible? I want to advertise this site:
Have u done advertising before on the community? lol. If not .. maybe we
should start? I can get you a few advertisers if you're willing to give up
the adspace.
