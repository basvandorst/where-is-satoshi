If all users use Tor only for sensitive communications, then state level adversaries can round up all users of Tor and the provided anonymity is of little use. Cat photos and Amazon shopping by non-subversives gives vulnerable users cover and is fundimental to the usefulness of Tor.
Should entities encouraging heavy routine use of Tor contribute relays? Absolutely.
