Me too - This night's numbers also just mentioned onion routing, and within the same five minutes, they managed to write a program to crack it, do so, and trace an IP to an address...Atleast the numbers were reasonable - the clearly fake IP addresses(645.872.123.632) always scare me.
GnuPG key ID is 0xE7D2ABB9

Well, there is  which explains that it is legal and has links to a few people - such as  if you actually have a C&D notice - or elsewise there is  and I know I read something about what to do - explain what Tor is, be polite, explain that it isn't you doing that, it's some other user. All those pages also have German versions, though I'm not sure if you already found them. Hopefully someone can find the other page I'd seen about dealing with law enforcement.

A very interesting and unique idea, though I can't believe that the
change due to a little heat would be detectable?

I can help a bit, though I'm not convinced that thunderbird is actually
checking my signatures, so ph34r.

3. You are always going through 3 other routers, and there is no way to
change that.

@_subject: Public lists of exit nodes? 
Does Tor or the EFF publish a list of Tor exit nodes? Are there lists
maintained by users? How often is this updated, and how long does a node
have to be down to be removed?

As was noted the last ten times (by my count) someone did this, and as
you were told when you registered, and as you are told in every email
sent by this list, and just like any other mailing list using this
software, of which there are a great many, your message says this:
and a few lines later,
Apparently, the illiterate still manage to learn how to subscribe
to mailing lists (perhaps their kids show them how?), though to what
purpose is anyone's guess.
