Google recaptcha seems to of banned Tor Relays entirely. I do not think
there is as much abuse of Tor Relays as they seem to claim.
One thing you can do is ask the sites you use to use a different captcha
technology. If they refuse they are probably not a website that you want
to trust anyways.
I'd love to see non-profit, ethical alternatives to the big sites we
currently use.
One platform, YouTube, would have bad effects if they banned the Tor
Network (they probably make too much from adverts to do that).

@_subject: [tor-talk] How do the OBFS4 "built-in" Bridges work? 
I see that Tor Browser, for users who are censored in their country,
work, or school (or have some other reason to use bridges) has a variety
of built in bridges. Once of those are the OBFS4 bridges. My first
thought would be these are hard coded, of course giving everyone the
same set of bridges is bad right? Then a bad actor could download Tor
Browser, get the list, and null route the IPs on their network(s). Also
these bridges could get quite crowded. Are the bridges being used to
fetch other bridges, or something else? How does Tor Browser handle
these risks / technical issues?

@_subject: [tor-talk] How do the OBFS4 "built-in" Bridges work? 
Thank you for clarifying that. The obfs4 bridges you can get at
bridges.torproject.org also pose an interesting risk, the ports each
Bridge IP Address is using seem to be non-standard, I'm in the US and
most networks I am at do not censor although sometimes certain ports at
public wifi networks are blocked, could a threat actor threatening you
or tor users in general realize an IP Address was a Tor Bridge by
identifying a large amount of traffic to a non-standard port on random
datacenter IP Addresses?
You can tell Tor Browser your Firewall only allows connections to
certain ports which I assume when used with bridges would help further
hide the fact you are using Tor.
The fact I email here obviously shows I am a Tor user, although I'd like
more technical measures built into Tor Browser to obfuscate the times I
am using Tor.

In situation two a censored user may give up on Tor entirely. Should we
allow exits in China or Iraq or Syria or Turkey or the several other

Consider the consequences of publishing the actual addresses. The number of
addresses is fine but the actual addresses should stay private for privacy
and security reasons.
I’m aware there are crawers looking for new services to show however if the
address is kept private only rouge HSDIRs are an issue and we can always
generate new addresses and delete the old keys.
I am running some Onion Services for SSH (clearnet disabled, you’ll need to
be physically present if Tor has an issue!) and while I require SSH Keys
it’d open a huge attack surface I’m  trying to avoid. It’s basicaly an
attempt at security by really advanced obscurity.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor official list of new .onion addresses? 
The implementation details of the SSH thing I talked about in my last email may of been unclear. When I said it's an security by advanced obscurity, I did not mean it's the only security. Other forms of access control are still in place. However keeping it only accessible over Onion Services means I don't have bots constantly trying to brute their way into SSH (stupid considering password auth is disabled guess that's China Unicom for you) I worry that publishing a list of every onion addressing would cause the same problem to come back.
1) User establishes a connection to OpenSSH Server over Tor Onion Services
2) User authenticates with their SSH Key (Password Auth is disabled, you can't even log in as root you need your own user and sudo)
2.5?) Secondary auth (played around with TOTP and U2F however haven't found a solution stable enough for my needs yet - still looking into it :)   )
3) User has a remote interactive bash shell protected with Onion Protocol Encryption
4) User is hopefully happy? Onion Services do tend to have higher latency so text editors like nano can be a bit sluggish - working on these issues one day at a time.
It's true that someone malicious can run a HSDir and get some (but not all) of the Onion Addresses however this would assume that your onion address ends up in a malicious HSDir (last time I checked it's published to 5 different HSDirs?). Most relays are run by good individuals. While the risk is considered, it's still better than a public address.
I'm sure people on this list heard about the LibSSH Vulnerabilty (Knock knock, can I come in, yes I can come in, I come in) a while back. While requiring users to access it over an Onion Service doesn't solve the larger problem of security vulnerabilty is limits who can attack exploit it. Targeted attacks will still work, however if all Vulnerable LibSSH Servers were hidden behind an unlisted Onion Service we wouldn't be having mass exploitation problems.
You mentioned "HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient", a feature I did not know about. I'm going to figure out if this is possible to implement on the SSH System as that would solve some concerns about a leaked onion address. Could you elaborate a bit more on this functionality?

If an onion site is compromised, you can serve the user malicious content and with a Tor Browser Vulnerability can harm it's users.

We don't know what vulnerabilities exist in the current version of Tor Browser. If IP Leaks and zero day vulerabilites put you in physical danger, consider Tor Tails. It uses firewall rules to try and block non-tor traffic. It's not bulletproof but simple proxy bypasses are mitigated.
Regarding the "CP Site" that you mentioned, the thing is that if the pedophiles had been using an up to date version of Tor Browser or you know, not looking at child pornography on Windows (macOS / Linux builds were not targeted as far as we know), they would not of been caught and would have remained free.
Some lessons learned...
1) Keep Tor Browser up to date2) Don't do illegal things on Windows, it has more users and is easier to mass target the most criminals by focusing on Windows hosts

@_subject: [tor-talk] Proposal: Making Tor Faster with TLS 1.3 
This is an informal proposal to make Tor faster. Okay as follows:
The Tor Network increasingly suffers from the challenge of dealing with high latency and often slow connection speeds. In an aim to protect privacy, Tor Browser does not have a persistent cache of web content meaning it has to be refetched every session. This means if you want to load a blog with a 10MB Javascript bundle, well you might be waiting a bit before reading the article. Likewise increasing speed and reducing latency is extremely important. The TLS 1.2 handshake's phases 2 and 3 have a total of 3 round trips before any data can be transferred. This could add 100s of MS of latency as the relays message back and forth with one another. TLS 1.3 has a feature called 0RTT (See:  ), the Tor network could have considerable speed and performance gains if this is implemented into Tor. The first benefit is reduced latency because of handshakes, the second benefit is better performance on the relays (less handshakes) freeing up relays and making faster sessions.
I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this.

So the state of available XMPP Clients today kinda sucks. There's Pidgin available for Linux Systems (it works and gets some security patches from time to time), there's ChatSecure for iOS, there's Conversations for Android. There are some clients without OMEMO/OTR for macOS and Windows but unless you fully trust both XMPP Servers in a chat that's not a good solution.
The alternative is "chat apps" like Signal by OpenWhisper or Wire by Wire Swiss GmbH but those are at the end of the day centralized apps so you have to trust the developers will play nice. In theory you can compile the mobile apps from source to avoid a backdoor.
Honestly it might not be a bad idea to make email popular again, at least then it's federated and there's no single entity that can censor or shutdown your communications, with the con that emails take up to a minute to transfer so it's not instant like chat.
You have to decide what tradeoffs you feel comfortable with, we can't make that decision for you.

Okay so if I connect to my blog in Tor Browser, it does not attempt to use TLS 1.3 while Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox use TLS 1.3 without an issue. (Ref:  )

At some point in 2019 will TorProject.org get an Onion v3 Address. Additionally at some point will Onion v3 Addresses become the default rather than v2?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Issue accessing Onion v3 Services 
I'm using the Tor Browser Bundle (v 8.0.4) on macOS to access the Tor Network. I am able to access Onion v2 Services without an issue. I am unable to access v3 Services at all. If it helps I requested bridges with the built in "bridge fetcher" thing that asks for a captcha then gives you bridges. It gave me obfs4 bridges. Clearweb and Onion v2 Services have no issues, it's just Onion v3 Services that have the issue. Is this a known bug? Is there a workaround?

I switched over to a private obfs4 bridge on a VM I rented and the issue is resolved. Maybe the bridges were running an out of date Tor daemon? As for which services I tried to access:
1) A v3 service running Up1 on my Raspberry Pi (Didn't work), the v2 index page loads without an issue.
2) A "chan" style website which used a v3 onion
I think it's still worth investigating bugs with bridges and v3 services as when I'm not using bridges (or using my new private bridge) v3s work fine.
