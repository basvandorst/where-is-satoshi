Hi,guys. I'm working on my own Tor controller recently. I want to do full controlling on circle and stream, but i found that Tor keep auto-buiding circles. How to prevent Tor from doing it?

Thx a lot for the information, we are just about to ignore the auto-
builded circuits, as you have mentioned in the last letter. Besides, the option "__LeaveStreamsUnattached" is no doubt a great help to us, which we haven't figured out so far. But since this option is not LISTED in any official documents, ie, "tor-reference.html", and can only be found in a complementary note to the discription of ATTACHSTREAM, I guess there must be some HIDDEN configuration lists of tor. Could you please help us out about Best Wishes!
