Karsten asked me to send a quick introduction about my new web service,
OnionView.com, with the intention of it being added to the next issue, or a
future issue, of TWN.
I was thinking it could sound something like this? I have lifted the
general layout from previous TWN articles relating to the launching of
*This week we saw the launch of OnionView, a web service which utilizes Tor
relay data, gathered using the Onionoo
 network status protocol, to plot the
location of active Tor nodes onto an interactive map of the world. Created
by Luke Millanta **with feedback from a number of community members,
including Karsten Loesing**, OnionView's relay database is updated every 30
minutes to help ensure map accuracy. Join us in the  IRC channel to
become involved in future OnionView developments.*

Hi Nusenu,
Have edited OV so that it updates once an hour with tor... Just need to
edit the about page (which I am doing now).
