This is exactly what new Tor Button does. Perhaps you need to update
your Tor Browser?

was a very intentional design choice:

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question about Circuit Separation 
This is a question about Tor Browser in specific.
I've found a number of websites [0] [1] [2] that explicitly warn of
visiting your personal website over tor. The explanation is always that
if you "access other sites in the same session", an eavesdropper would
deduce that it was the owner of the (little-read) personal site.
Doesn't Tor Browser use a new circuit for each domain? Is the advice
faulty or am I missing something?

@_subject: [tor-talk] How was the user agent decided? 
Tor Browser uses the "extended support release" (ESR) of Firefox. ESR
is designed mainly for organizations that need to deploy Firefox and
have a focus on stability.
The reason I believe Tor Browser is based on the ESR build is that it
is updated less often, allowing more time for adding privacy-enhancing
features. This also means that such features break less often.
Of course, security updates are pushed to the ESR branch as soon as
they come out on "normal" Firefox, so there is no added security risk.
As for the user-agent, I'm assuming Windows was chosen because that's
what 90%+ of PC's are running.

Could anyone please explain the reason behind this spike [0] to me?
