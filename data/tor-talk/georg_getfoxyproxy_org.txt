James Marshall:
they are working. In a privacy-preserving way. See:
for a more in-depth explanation what is meant by this and for the state
of the implementation + what is missing. (You might want to look at
section 4.6 as well as identifiers are not the only issue here.)

BM-2D9WhbG2VeKsLCsGBTPLGwDLQyPizSqS85 at bitmessage.ch:
That is wrong. ESR 17.0.11 is/was a security update and we are shipping
it in the current TBB. Have a look at the ESR cycle to see that we are
not behind Firefox ESR
( "What does the
Mozilla Firefox ESR life cycle look like?"). The new bundles with
Firefox 24 ESR will come out within the next days.

could you test whether the (upcoming) bundles linked to in
do help? Accessibility support is compiled into them.

Yasemin Acur:
we are cross-compiling Tor Browser for Windows on Linux with mingw-w64.
It turned out that the accessibility related code in Firefox 17 ESR did
not like that, so we had to disable that feature until we could find a
fix for it. We left it disabled for TBB 3.5 which is based on ESR 24
assuming that issue was still there. We were wrong and therefore enabled
accessibility support in the QA builds of TBB 3.5.1 again.

I still see that with the latest Nightly on Linux.

There is already a ticket:
You might want to add comments there if there are indeed ways to
fingerprint the TorBrowser via requests to 127.0.0.1.

Yes, but see what the design specification says regarding the attacker
(especially section 4).
Thus, I doubt that the TorBrowser is the proper platform to defend
against an attacker you have in mind.

Are you seeing  ?
If so, then it might be interesting to understand why it is happening in
your case (see comment 2 for an explanation for the failure on my
testing machine). If there is a different explanation we need to add
that one to  to take
it into account for the Final Algorithm.
