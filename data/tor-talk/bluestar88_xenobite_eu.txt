This is a rude behavior against all current server node users.

Another possible way would be, to integrate the server hoster into your

What about telling the provider what you are going to do, which risks
there are and how to handle abuse inquiries?
This way of open (and fair) play could give you some advantages in
serious situations later!
They want you as customer, but only if they're able to evaluate the
possible risks. This is understandable. But on this open play, i could
imagine, they have the chance to succor your business and probable are
able to explain to the officers, *before* they take your server off...
If the node operators claim to be white hats, wouldn't that be a good
way to obtain some serious understanding?

Yes, you're right, currently. This wasn't meant to be a way to avoid
server confiscation at *this* time. But if Tor node operators get a more
official acceptance somedays, there could be a way to handle this a
better way (i hope). Think on professional service providers, they get
the chance to *cooperate*, not just get cut off. What 'cooperation'
means in detail, who knows...
Until there is more *legal certainty*, we have to go a stony way to
promote this. But we can try to generate more goodwill. The plausibility
of the Tor operator raises and falls with *how* he's doing such things.
So the point i was up to still remains: Transparency on Tor usage at all
levels of the infrastructure. The hosters/providers shouldn't get known
about the Tor usage by bad surprise only, then it gots blacklisted by
AUP sometime, until no one remains!
There's a need for Tor (and anonymity in general) and a part of the
society knows it. But we have to find the right and open way to it, we
loose otherwise..

Not anymore, since you have to integrate a so called "intermediate
certificates" in the servers and clients to fix an CA update issue:
"...On the 24th of December we updated our Intermediate CA certificates
and added a few needed extension to the original certificate. The public
key however did not change and all subscriber certificates are perfectly
valid. Please follow the instructions below to update your Intermediate
CA certificate..." [1]
They ease of use is not given anymore, not for the server admins (a less
point), nor for the users/visitors (a very bad point).

You're right!
While testing this, I've made a mistake which lead me to that wrong
conclusion in my previous email:
I've placed *all* certs into *one* PEM file (ssl.key, ssl.crt, ca.crt,
ca-intermediate-server.crt and DH) assuming a smarter file usage by the
daemon and that was badly wrong!
The CA parts were simply not recognized!
These instructions are simple to follow by just reading them:
As server admin I'm trying to do a good job now! ;-)

What's that? A little shocked I looked at this:
Is this already well known?
The gateway proxies could do bad on Tor this way...
BTW: I've taken off all the onion catalog links from
torcheck.xenobite.eu, I really don't want to unsettle the people..

Bold node names have "named" flag set, look here [1].
Different OR ports are a decision of each Tor node operator. If an

a special group of users, who only are able to access port 80/443,
because of firewall/proxy limitations...

The MAC addresses are for addressing between two network interfaces
only, so this information does not leave the segment (collision
domain). Every router changes source and target MAC after getting the
IP route solved.
The Tor entry node sees the source MAC from it's own segment router
only.

I'm not sure, that I understand you correctly. Can you be more specific
about your setup?
If your node resides at your home network, your provider sees only the
traffic, which goes out and in, passing your internet-link router. Your
provider sees your router's MAC and sets your external IP-address, so
he knows both. As long you haven't set any port forwarding (allowing
inbound connections on your router), nobody from the outside can see, if
any ports are open within your local network.
Only if your router is compromised, either by remote controlled
auto-updating (your provider) or by using an exploit (a random
attacker), it is possible to enable remote login for watching your local
network traffic at the end.

So a hoax at all? Andre76, you shouldn't have fear talking about your
(huge!) access provider. Naming it wouldn't unmask anything. So, could
you clearify this one please?
Anyways, US based TLDs and provider controlled DNS still remain as
weak points. Many wanted (by censoring) and unwanted (by failure)
interruptions are caused by DNS, I'm sure. One day we need peripheral
DNS, P2P'based or the like.
If there was a real outage and by chance caused by any DNS
problems, people with own resolver settings (other or own DNS) wouldn't
even have noticed them. ;-)

It doesn't help to throw FUD in here by saying the sky is falling and

The best rule is to keep the mind clear and the eyes open. Keep asking
good questions, try to get reasonable answers and rely only on facts at
the very end.
Since there seem to be no facts, this thread seems to be senseless and
condemned to make no real progress.
 I'm sorry about the pull-the-plug thing, but it was just the

I don't know IRSSI that much.
Port 6697 is the SSL port, are you sure you use IRSSI in SSL mode?
Maybe you've to add '-ssl' or something.

Hello Patrick,
I don't know, who runs that service, but by using SSL, certificate verification and fingerprinting and optional OTR on top of that, there's nothing wrong with that one. Better having a stable unknown channel, than blocked official ones.
That hidden service works well with my IRC-bouncer, which I use with "usewithtor" (torsocks wrapper). It seems to be quite robust to me.
Well, your initial request was to have at least a temporary alternative.
