@_subject: Tor (started by Vidalia) ignores StrictEntryNodes + EntryNodes 
Tor has 3 default EntryGuards. They are different from EntryNodes which are
defined by users.
Tor picks EntryGuards by itself.
*UseEntryGuards **0*|*1* If this option is set to 1, we pick a few long-term
entry servers, and try to stick with them. This is desirable because
constantly changing servers increases the odds that an adversary who owns
some servers will observe a fraction of your paths. (Defaults to 1.)
*NumEntryGuards **NUM* If UseEntryGuards is set to 1, we will try to pick a
total of NUM routers as long-term entries for our circuits. (Defaults to 3.)
look here:

from this paper:
"First, bandwidth is already a key factor in Tor
design. Second, bandwidth is typically a property of a node
rather than a link between two nodes, since the bottleneck is
likely to be close to the node rather than in the intermediate

maybe you should restart Tor

@_subject: Limiting hops 
i suppose the packets from the exit Tor node to the destination are still
which means that your request can still be seen by anybody who want to see
it, only
he can't know where this request is from.
but if the only one node in the path/circuit(suppose you just want only one
node) is
some malicious node, there will be nothing different from connectiong to the
directly, may be even worse.
this is also why Tor uses 3 nodes, entry node doesn't know your destination,
exit node
dosen't know you, and middle node prevents cooperating between entry node
and exit node

when choosing the middle nodes, it excludes the exit node and other middle
nodes first.
and then exclude itself if it's a or. and randomly choose a node in the
running routers list which contains all those routers only if it's now
running and valid and you think it's reliable enough.
so actually i don't see there's some policy to exlude those exit nodes

sorry, i'm saying it excludes the exit node and the other middle nodes first
in the same path

Nick and coderman, thank you for your responding.
I downloaded the 0.2.1.10-alpha source tarball again
and configure it and make it. It succeeded this time.
It's running normally as a client now. And then I come back to
the first tarball I've downloaded a few days ago, re-
configure it and make it again, also succeed this time.
I just don't know how could this happen.
The compiling is totally according to the instructions
for building Tor from tor-win32-mingw-creation.txt in the
'doc' file. But it's from 0.1.2.19 source tarball. I've
compared this instructions with the new ones from the
new source version(say 0.2.1.10-alpha). No big differences
except the versions: I use MinGW-5.1.3.exe, openssl-
0.9.8g.tar.gz and libevent 1.3e. I'm wondering if I should
change the versions later. But the compiling did succeed
with those older versions. It seems it's not affected.
The config.log is rewritten since I reconfigured it. So I'm afraid I
have lost the script before the successful compiling now.
At last, here's a question which confuse me for a long long time.
Everytime when my PC is running as a relay, even for a
little while, I cannot reach any web pages later. I'm not sure if it
has something to do with the PC itself. The configuration is as follows:
Pentium 4 CPU 2.93GHz,
502MB RAM,
Windows XP Professional(version 2002) Service Pack 3
the bandwidth limits and the exit policies for my relay are
both default in Vidalia, that is >1.5Mbps.

*MaxCircuitDirtiness **NUM* Feel free to reuse a circuit that was first used
at most NUM seconds ago, but never attach a new stream to a circuit that is
too old. (Default: 10 minutes) from this page:
