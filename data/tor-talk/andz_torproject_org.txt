@_subject: [tor-talk] OONI #ADINA15 Hackathon postponed 
Hash: SHA512
We are sorry to mention that but unfortunately the OONI hackathon that
was planned in to take place on Oct. 1-2 in Rome has been postponed to
an unknown (yet) date!
It was not an easy decision but we cannot do anything from our side to
change this:
We had to postpone the hackathon, in fact, due to health issues that
would have forced some core OONI developers to skip the hackathon itself.
This would have greatly reduced the overall value and usefulness of
the event, hence we decided it was better to reschedule it.
An announcement will follow when a new possible date for the event
will be available.
Thank you,
