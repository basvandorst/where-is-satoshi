Not just wormholes, but closed timelike curves, which is General
Relativity-speak for "time travel". I'm not worried.

@_subject: Do Tor options FascistFirewall and ReachableAddresses have anything to do with each other? 
The Tor manual at:
is unclear whether option FascistFirewall must be set to 1 in order for
option ReachableAddresses to be honored. The description of FascistFirewall
says it must be set to 1 for option FirewallPorts to be honored, and the
description of FirewallPorts says it is deprecated in favor of
ReachableAddresses, but the link (or absence thereof) between
FascistFirewall and ReachableAddresses is unspecified.
Can anyone shed some light on this issue?

@_subject: Tor (started by Vidalia) ignores StrictEntryNodes + EntryNodes 
I'm running Vidalia 0.1.10 and Tor 0.2.0.32 (r17346) on Windows XP.
I stopped Tor from the Vidalia GUI, and manually edited Vidalia's
"torrc" file, adding these two lines at the bottom:
  StrictEntryNodes 1
  EntryNodes BostonUCompSci,FSF,moria1,SelfEvident,superbad,fuga,augrime,askatasuna,VSvTZGO7UPj4yh8,conf555nick,desync,phobos
After re-starting Tor from the Vidalia GUI, I see circuits that have
entry nodes that are _not_ from the above list. In fact, nearly all
circuits have entry nodes that are not from the above list.
Is this a known problem?

Update: If I add the following four lines to the bottom of Vidalia's "torrc"
file, then Tor honors the StrictExitNodes + ExitNodes options, but it
ignores the StrictEntryNodes + EntryNodes options:
  StrictEntryNodes 1
  EntryNodes BostonUCompSci,FSF,moria1,SelfEvident
  StrictExitNodes 1
  ExitNodes BostonUCompSci,FSF,moria1,SelfEvident
Although, Tor seems to only use the first of the specified ExitNodes.
Shouldn't it round-robin between them?

Am I correct to assume that your message below means that when
UseEntryGuards is set to 1 it causes Tor to ignore the value of
The manual doesn't state that UseEntryGuards takes precedence over
StrictEntryNodes. Which is unfortunate because UseEntryGuards defaults to 1,
which means that StrictEntryNodes is, by default, ignored.

One of the great benefits (to me at least) of Tor is that it uses
SSL-encrypted TCP connections to talk to the ORs.  These are sometimes the
only way out through a draconian firewall at an employer or other
institution. Wouldn't switching to UDP as the underlying transport
eliminiate this benefit?

Ideally, TCP wouldn't be used in
I asked this earlier, but didn't see a response ...  Wouldn't moving Tor
away from TCP connections impact the client's ability to connect out through
draconian firewalls (i.e., those that block all outbound connections except
HTTP and HTTPS)? If Tor wants to be valuable to journalists, aid workers,
disgruntled citizens, etc. then having it be UDP-based just makes it trivial
for an organization or government to block outbound client connections.
Granted, the same organization could block outbound HTTPS connections, but
that has a much higher visibility and the press can call it "blocking access
to the Web", which it cannot say about blocking UDP traffic.

This implies that there is a generally agreed upon "proper" way to combine
Bittorrent with Tor. Is there such a thing?

In  Tyler
Close, the author of the Petname add-on for Firefox says that Petname no
longer binds the chosen petname to the SSL certificate but to the origin
(URL scheme, hostname, port number). He references Collin Jackson's research
on origin granularity in browsers at
 as justification for this change.
This is ok, but I'd also like to be alerted when the certificate changes for
a site that I regularly visit. If I visit  and an
attacker steals or cache-poisons that domain name using a valid SSL
certificate (but not the one from the real owner of the site), then Petname
can't help me.
