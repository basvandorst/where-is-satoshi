@_subject: [tor-talk] Open link from command line in running tor browser 
This might be the wrong place to ask this but I looked at and could not find a more suitable list. Please direct me away if I'm in the wrong place.
I also suspect that this might be a little stupid but here we go.
I'm running debian and I've got very used to open urls from command line by something like '$ iceweasel and then iceweasel opens the site in a new tab.Now I'm slowly migrating to using tor browser as my standard browser and I really miss this feature.
When trying the same "trick" out of the box then I just get an error saying that firefox is already running.
Is is possible to tweak tor brower in some way to make this work?

@_subject: [tor-talk] Passing links from command line to Tor Browser 
Hi, I'm wondering if it might be possible to pass links from command the
command line into a already open and running tor browser?
I've managed to open TBB to a specific urls on startup by adding
no-remote to the "./firefox..." lines in the start-tor-browser script.
But how about passing links into a open tor browser? When I try I get
the "Tor Browser is already running, but is not responding..."-error
To add some context, my goal with this is in the end to open links from
my rss reader newsbeuter in Tor browser.
Any help on how to accomplish this would be highly appreciate
With kindly regards
