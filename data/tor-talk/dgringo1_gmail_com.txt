I have opened the (personal) Pandora's Box of considering security, etc,
and I have been observing this list, so now I am keen for more myself
.  I have taken note of the recent postings re. distros -- much I
have historically considered -- but I have to concerning questions: 1)  How
does Slackware stack-up (no pun intended) and 2) Having two Mac Minis
without a working CD/DVD, how can I burn a bootable USB device or
Any and all helpful comments welcome.

Ah, but as far as I am aware (having tried it), it generates a USB disk BUT
it is not recognised or bootable from a Mac.
What say you?  :)

Oddly, it seems that VirtualBox (a recent exploration and use of) might be
able to provide most of what I might need.  Certainly it can run Linux
VMs... and my 2nd Mac is really looking for a decent purpose in it's life.
I'll have a look at your link.

This I hear about; sounds like h/w which uses tor, or is McAfee maintaining
he is, effectively, doing his own tor system?

Hello, I am an Ex 'low-level' programmer (assembler, C and C++) of many
years back -- well, nothing amazing -- officially some ~13 years ago, due
to a head injury.
As you might not know, a head injury is a programmer's career's sign of
death -- I was not interested in tech-support, etc.  I am fine, but
obviously found it near impossible to fight my way back to any reasonable
Enough of that (unless probed nicely :).
I have -- for my own reasons -- stopped advancing my OS X machine's OS at
Tiger.  I enjoy working with it and doing my small-time programming.  I
have been exposed to 'tor' in the recent past and would really like to use
it on my version of OS X.
To that end, I would like to offer my efforts in attempting to fix tor or
openssl or whatever is blocking tor from working on Tiger.  If this is
appealing to yourselves and I am successful, I would be interested in
applying myself to other development work.

Wow -- you have chosen an operating system that last got security updates
in 2007. Adventure.
Tor should build there (Tor should build everywhere).
However, I expect you're going to have a tough time getting a modern
Firefox working, and without that you're not going to have any good
protections from application-level privacy issues:
(Hmm, I suspect I shall have to change my mailing format, as responding
'in-list' format is not to convenient.)
Right, as for tor and me, at the moment;  It does build but seems to
seg-fault in ssl.  I am using Macports.  I am not very familiar with the
appropriate tools (cc, ld, etc or whatever) yet, but should pick it all up
I am interested in doing what I said and will very much need pointers to
'catchup' and understand the tech., uses, etc.
As an aside, besides some unknown specifics re. security, what could
possibly be in a new version of OS X -- or any OS?

"exploits all the time" -- I am not convinced, for me, it happens...
 certainly less so for a less used OS, or version of.  Obviously if one is
having trouble with some exploit, that would be something to deal/worry
about, but I have never had any issues with OS X generally (and probably
Linux/BSD).  So chasing the bleeding edge of a system/OS could be just that

"At least Darwin is kept more up to date than Apple OS X 10.4.*"
Is not Macports really the Darwin efforts?

You're insecure if you drive without a seat-belt, or cross the road, or
fly, etc, but the vast majority of people who do not, are safe and fine. As
long as you are aware, one should be safe, or, if required, be able to
repair any active fault/hole.  You do not want to start getting wagged by
the 'tail'! ;)
I am not concerned about vendor control, if anything, it is a deeper, more
subtle, social control.  But I am not concerned, as I have never 'crashed'
(discounting Windows or, rarely, OS X) and do not foresee it.
I have no issues with Linux, in many ways that is where I have always been
heading... and was very happy when OS X appeared (as, at the time, Linux
was just too much 'work' to deal with), but I do not wish to be needlessly
pushed or coerced in doing, buying or fretting about anything, ultimately,
as unimportant to living and breathing as computing is -- OK, it is
important to financial types and governments, but they are keen to monitor
every penny and how they can wring more from ourselves.
I believe there is more people like myself, not interested in chasing some
metaphysical goal of needless progress -- certainly technology.  :)
Bye-the-by, I do have a netbook with which I play with Ubuntu and or

Yes of course, but I am unaware of any drive-by exploits on any 'nix
computer, let alone one's with reasonable firewalls.  :)  I do not sit
about with my finger where the sun does not shine, but there is easily a
point reached where enough is enough (re. personal security).
My systems are, from my perspective, rarely insecure.  Are you a PC/Windows
users?  ;)
PS.  Another point; I currently live in the dreaded place of the outskirts
of Santiago, Chile.  I would find it very interesting and novel if ever I
was 'attacked'.  I should be moving back, to where I often have prolonged
stays, to the USA, very soon now.

Mick; sorry, you are right.  :)
I am just seeking where I can, programatically, help in the causes of tor
AND, as it happens, a not up to date OS.

Great Krishna, a much more complete context for MacPorts and (the)
I am slowing working on an 'old' netbook with Linux; it could be
interesting to use it to further explore Open/PureDarwin.
In the short term I would be interested in discussing / researching how to
configure tor to work on my OS X Tiger machine -- possibly the issue is
with the openssl stuff, but it is all, currently, Greek to me :)

Uh, thanks, I guess.  I was only asking for pointers and advice, etc, and
do much work myself, not to consume anyone else's precious time...  I mean,
realise they (or you) could be 'saving the world', or some such, by helping
a bleeding-edge, essential OS.  ;-)
Red Hat or Centos and or Debian; yes they do and have appealed, alas I have
a perfectly good and secure OS X Tiger -- which I have no reason to
upgrade...  Oops, I have wasted time defending myself before, so I
will not.
No, I wish to do this predominately myself (with some pointers and advice),
I am not looking to stop others climate modelling or genetic interference
Thanks again for the advice, scarp.

Eugen, thanks for the info.
Upgrading to Leopard (10.5) has always been an option for myself, but I
invariably find, with minor work, upgrading is never required -- and yes,
IMHO, I have never been insecure or threatened in any IT way.
I remember as a programmer that using the latest OS or s/w was always
easier, and, thus, it is easy to indirectly support the consumerist-IT
mentality of upgrade, newer is better, more righteous, etc.
I imagine, like "homebrew" (mainly for PPC), I would like to eventually
set-up a web-site,  or sourceforge presence, for *Luddite* like myself ;)

I have an Intel and it is possible I shall have to compile the openssl.

For all of 'you'; I shall appreciate 'security' and tor the more I use 'em
and, as Mr Lewman says, the more I get the feel and love of GCC, etc.  As I
have said before, I innately have, and had, a draw towards Linux/BSD for
over 15 years, but until proven (to me) otherwise, I think my 'quite'
secure Tiger OS X works for me -- discounting it's (non-Apple) s/w I love;
e.g. TextMate.
In anycase, let this 'Truth-Seeker' integrate before you start wailing and
moaning :)

;)  At the risk of continuing some historical battle, I no doubt agree with
the essence of what you say, BUT 1) we are NOT supporting a bottom line and
2) we should do the most for other, non-IT, people to rein in the
commercial forces in our industry -- I think things are moving too fast and
_who_ is responsible and _who_ really benefits?  A lot of the scare
tactics, bugs and worries are brought about (I think) as motivators to
upgrade equipment and s/w -- i.e. make us needlessly spend our hard earned
Ultimately I would like to contribute MY efforts in keeping any braking
systems alive and well... OK, I am sure I will have to address some
security issues, but it is not like there is n-gadzillion security holes
and newer software expose them -- they are often created BY newer software.
Part of my mindset would be to support existing software, which has been
left by the side of the road, by the rush for commercial progress and
profits.  :(  Is this not partly what Open Software is all about?  Is it
not to support the IT minority?

I would be interested, although I am using OS X Tiger, and am currently on
my learning curve while working on another sub-project.
