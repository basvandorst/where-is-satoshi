Besides, just think of the economic impact this would have. They're
already sacrificing their economy, disconnecting from the net would be
economic suicide. That would completely lock them out from
international trading of pretty much all the basics.
Perhaps there are more sources with more detailed/sourced info.

The Basic Problem, that I see here, is that, if they have surveillance covering everything, they will probably also have access to and monitor whats going on on these PCs, locally. So putting Tor on these is not going to help. To the contrary, it might make things even worse for people using a torified machine.

Hi Robin,
last time I checked, Hetzner did not allow to run Tor exits. Make sure if that still is the case before you run into trouble with them.

Just out of curiosity: Do you also get
"[notice] cull_wedged_cpuworkers(): Bug: closing wedged cpuworker. Can
somebody find the bug?
[err] cpuworker_main(): Bug: writing response buf failed. Exiting.
[warn] Tried to establish rendezvous on non-OR or non-edge circuit."
after several days of Tor running?

If that bug is triggered, it would show after 24-48 hours of Tor
running. It is actually (in theory) fixed now, but so far apparently
nobody has actually reported it to be fixed (in practise).
Its this one: As it triggers on FreeBSD, I'd assume it to also do so on NetBSD.

Ah, okay, so then you can probably just forget about it. Never had
that bug trigger on Linux.
Would've been interested about Tor performance on SPARC, though ;-)

Awesome stuff! Love the ideas you've got, there ;-). Would you mind
people re-using that?
Don't make it too complex, else it probably won't work/be unreliable.
Maybe use this kind of exercise to introduce them into the subject,
then lay about the shortcomings and introduce them to Tor after they'd
had this exercise.
Also go into a little detail as to why services like Tor are needed,
to make sure they don't miss the point.

We test bye doing ssl handshakes, which works fine for exits and obfs.
You can find our code on github.com/zwiebelfreunde.

I thought those services are just using regular XMPP, so it might be possible to connect to them via the xmpp client of your choice. tor user22  schrieb:
