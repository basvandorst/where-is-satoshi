introduces a new approach to providing fallback
Thanks for adding the geoip6 file, I was wondering with 0.2.4.6 in a
bridge I run, where to get it.
This is not a 0.2.4.7 specific question: I've got a question about
compiling tor from source. What is the need for these arguments for
user at box:~/tor-0.2.4.7-alpha$ ./configure --help |grep with-tor-
  --with-tor-user=NAME    Specify username for tor daemon
  --with-tor-group=NAME   Specify group name for tor daemon
when one can use "User UID" in torrc (from
 , under General
Options). Or does this torrc option has nothing to do with the
configure argument?
