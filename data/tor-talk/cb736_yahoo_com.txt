Welcome to the twenty-fifth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the ever-updating Tor
Tor 0.2.4.19 is out
Tails saw its 35th release on December 11th [4]. It incorporates many
major and minor improvements and bugfixes, and opens up the new
incremental-upgrade feature for beta-testing.
As this is the first release to feature a browser based on the Firefox
24 ESR series, some small inconveniences found their way in. Have a look
at the known issues before giving it a go.
Nevertheless, it fixes several important security issues [5], so it is
recommended that all users upgrade as soon as possible.
?  [4] ?  [5] Torservers.net awarded $250,000 grant
The Tails team reported on the vast amount of activity that occurred
during November 2013 [12]. Coming up in the next few Tails releases are
an updated I2P, a new clock applet with configurable timezone, better
localization, incremental upgrades, safer persistence, MAC spoofing?
? [12] meejah announced the release of txtorcon 0.8.2, and warned users that
they should upgrade if they use that program?s TCP4HiddenServiceEndpoint
feature, in order to fix a bug that allows listening on hosts other than
127.0.0.1 [13].
? [13] Kevin P Dyer announced the 0.2.2 release of fteproxy, which ?includes
the removal of gmpy as a dependency, additional documentation to explain
the significance of language theoretical algorithms, and bounds checking
of the input/output of our (un)ranking algorithms? [14]; this hot on the
heels of 0.2.1, in which he ?focused on breaking away from heavyweight
dependencies: OpenFST and boost? [15].
? [14] ? [15] Mike Perry shared his thoughts regarding the presence of the Tor Browser
Bundle in centralized repositories such as the Apple App Store or Google
Play, and the possibilities for attack that these stores open up [16].
? [16] Ondrej Mikle warned users of Enterprise Linux 5 that Tor RPM packages
will no longer be built for their platform, owing to an ?increasing
number of required workarounds? [17].
? [17] Karsten Loesing published a summary of the past, present and the future
of the Tor Metrics project, which he maintains, offering some context
for the various changes that have recently been announced [18].

@_subject: [tor-talk] How safe is smartphones today? 
To me this has nothing to do with "What are you afraid of?" Each of us have a fundamental right to privacy. The ability to call our spouse and ask them to pick up a loaf of bread, or for us to call up someone we are planning a bank robbery with and have 100% confidence that not one word of the conversation will ever be available to anyone but the intended recipient. We can do that, with public key cryptography, which needs to be standard. It is blatantly wrong for governments to try to break any security measures. Any efforts they do though, must be made public and be done only for the purpose of helping us know that our encryption can not be broken.

Thanks to all for replying.
Well, I try not to get caught in the dragnet. Besides, I have no special
threat model or fear.
But, the situation could change quickly in certain situations without
your intention.
For example, I want to talk to political activists, I would like to
discuss with them, no matter if I share their views or not. This could
easily make you interesting for certain people. Sometimes just talking
to certain people could make you suspicious.
And this is my concern.
Is a mobile device safe to use for "sensitive" discussions?
In my view and recent events suggest you can become a target, although
you are just a small number. Just talking to people could cause this.
If I listen to the discussion in this thread, a mobile device is not
adequate at all to protect your data in case of a targetted attack.
I guess, the only safe way would be to use an offline device for storing
data and a second device for online communication. And a third device
may be necessary. There are devices, that connect with bluetooth to your
smartphone and do all all the encryption totally encapsulated in its own
little box.
I don?t have any current need for such steps, but want to know what is
the current state in security.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Pogoplug: is safe enough against NSA? 
I would categorically assume the answer to be no until the NSA starts working for the people of the United States instead of against us. Until they are completely transparent in what they do, and completely honest in their results, it is easier to assume no. The NSA does not even trust itself. They replaced all the cables and all of the computers that Edward Snowden could have had access to with the assumption that they could not tell if any of them were bugged. Public key cryptography should be safe. We know that 128 bit keys, are not sufficiently robust today, but mathematically 1024 or 2048 should be. Whether they are or not will not be known for some time. There are examples of someone saying that their email was read and used against them in a court case when it was expected to be secure, but normally this is done by finding the secret key through the placement of malware on the subjects computer.
Unfortunately the only way to find out if it is secure is to do something horrendously illegal and find out if you get caught.

When I start up TBB, I get a separate window, that used to be Vidalia, and which had some useful functions. Now that has been replaced with a useless window saying "Connecting to the Tor Network" that goes away. Any chance of bringing back the Vidalia Control Panel? Today I was on an exit node that stopped working. I really was not interested in waiting 15 minutes to be assigned a new exit node, and so clicked on "new identity". But TBB does not store anything, so when I was back up and running, I had to re-open all of the previous tabs and re-log into all of the sites I had been using. It was so much easier with Vidalia. You just go look for the Vidalia window, click "Use a New Identity" and boom you are back in business. SOoooooooooooo much easier.

TBB regularly gives me a new exit node without abruptly restarting the browser. What is the harm in allowing me to manually do that when needed? I know how to close the browser, and do that whenever I want, but all I want is a new exit mode. And yes the map and the other things from the control panel would be nice too.

Well, easier doesn't mean safe. Browsers keep a lot of state around that
can potentially be used to track you across different Tor circuits.
That's why New Identity now restarts the whole browser. Everybody knows
that the usability of that is awful, but there's no better solution
right now.
If Vidalia had any means to control the browser process, it would have
restarted it also in the old design.

Yes same request. The ticket though is closed, and is slightly different. I doubt that anyone would use TBB if it randomly closed itself every 10 or 15 minutes, closing all open tabs, and then restarted itself, but without any of the old history. Just thought I would bring it up again to see if anyone was working on this.

Someone commented to the effect that "if Vidalia could have" it would have closed the browser and reopened it each time a new exit node was chosen. I was just saying that would not have gone over very well.
There seem to be three items from the control panel that people have requested.
1. Being able to start and stop Tor
2. The map
3. A new exit node
I would add NEWNYM just above new identity, and it can either use N or E for an accelerator key. In the attachment I used E, but I actually would suggest N instead.?

It was closed as a duplicate of this bug [1], which is still active. Who's talking about TBB closing itself every 10 to 15 minutes?? These
tickets are about adding a "New Circuit" or "New Exit" button in TBB
(which would do the exact same thing as the "New Identity" button did in
Vidalia).? Does this not solve the exact problem you described?

So this time when TBB stopped working, instead of clicking "new identity" and re-opening all of the tabs (I actually could not do that the second time because I would have lost an edit), I just waited. And wrote down the IP address. And it was the same both times.

For that you would additionally want to be able to choose which state and/or city, because local stations carry different programming. Our lovely Congress passed a law prohibiting cable and satellite providers from offering us more than one network affiliate, but that choice would be wonderful for a lot of reasons.
I would like it because a site sees that I am in, say, Spain, and I can not read anything on the screen. I have to figure out how to change the URL to get an English speaking version. It would be easier to just switch IP address.

Well hulu has to respect MPIAA restrictions.

I do not think such a list would be practical. I operate an exit node and contacted a board that was blocking the IP and they said it was because of bad users, but changed it to not block me but did not say by what means. The practice of blocking an IP due to inappropriate content is widespread, and has unintended consequences. There would inevitably be too many exit nodes blocked from use to make Tor useful.

I agree that we need to make Tor so simple and so bulletproof that it is not possible to use something like timing to make deductions. The fact that only one student may have used Tor introduces another vulnerability that needs to be removed in some manner. We do need to use examples of people using Tor for evil purposes to learn how to make it useful for people who use it for good purposes. We can not distinguish between the two, but we will never know if we have succeeded unless we have examples of failures.

I can only speak for the United States, like all other evil countries or empires, with a Constitution which says a lot of lovely things, and which is completely ignored by the Nazis who came to power in 2000, even allegedly calling it just a g-d piece of paper.
There are legal, constitutional ways of catching people who commit crimes, like when Kennedy was assassinated. The FBI agent in charge of determining if there was anyone else involved is said to have concluded after 30 years that if there had been they would have spilled the beans to someone over that time (despite the movie with the line "I've still got the shovels" - that were used to bury the others involved). The US will have to go through its own purge like when East Germany re-united and all of the files of the Stazi became available for us to definitively know. May that day come soon. I would love to find out what my fbi file says but I am unwilling to give them my name so that they can tell me. They are though, free to post all of their files online so that I can look for myself to see if there even is any file.
Unfortunately the pressure to commit crimes is identical for those who are tasked with solving crimes as those who are tasked with committing them (cosy little symbiotic relationship there - without crime there would be no courts jails police or lawyers, so they all hope that crime will increase just so they will have a job). So there are just as many corrupt police and judges as there are honest criminals. The best thing for the police to do is use tools that are legal. Credit cards were stolen and used to make $700,000 of donations to non-profits. Almost all of those charges can be reversed, and the cards replaced. Will someone catch the person who stole 40 million credit card numbers from Target? Maybe, maybe not. The United States as a Nazi regime has chosen to create an enormous, and completely unconstitutional NSA, which siphons and stores all electronic data. The US would be better suited to completely close the agency. Our own government has
 become our greatest threat.
Typically most people are good, and are able to find a means of income that does not harm anyone, but our corporations are not without guilt. Countless stockbrokers have flat out swindled people out of their retirement (think the wolf of wallstreet). But if you want to make the world better you can not do it by yourself making it worse.
There are two types of communication, private and public. Public such as this, or to or from a public official, all of which must be made public in a timely manner, and private, meaning intended for only one other person and that person not being a public official. Private needs to be kept private forever, with no exceptions, and we now have the technology to make that possible, and just as private as it was before there was any technology (what your great-great grandfather or grandmother said to their neighbor, if not made public, is most assuredly the same security we need to enjoy today). We need to by default be encrypting all communications, including telephone, text, and e-mail, so that wiretapping is impossible. Removing that tool from law enforcement does not eliminate all possibility of lawfully bringing someone to trial who has committed a crime. Eliminating NSA will not make it any less or more likely that the US will be able to either prevent
 or allow the next Boston/New York/Oklahoma bombing, for example. (I contend that we allowed 911 and wanted it to happen, so we could justify the completely unpatriotic Patriot Act, and the invasion of Afghanistan which was not to capture Bin Laden - a team of four could have done that, but to restore the growth of heroin providing opium poppies, which the Taliban, at the request of the UN, had just done.)
The world is what we make it - make it good.

How I would have handled it, is that it does not matter whether they are caught or not. The disruption to the campus by how the threat was handled was the only actual crime committed, not the threat itself. If you choose to investigate it at all you can interview the students affected. There was an episode of "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" where Danny Divito is arrested and uses his one phone call to call 911 and call in a bomb threat.
Student campuses always have pranks, and "catching" the perpetrators is not a priority.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Signing up for checking account over Tor 
Probably not overly optimistic. There are though, no bad people, only good people who do bad things, but Tor is not designed to enable bad things, and is not overly used for bad things. It was designed to allow privacy on the Internet, and enable people to do good things that they would not otherwise be able to do, without severe consequences. Many public telephones were removed in the US "because they were being used by drug dealers", but they were not installed for drug dealers (and it is moronic to remove them for that reason - when they could instead be used to catch drug dealers). Tor is inherently designed so that it can be used by everyone, with no consequences, no matter what it is used to accomplish.

It was not as dumb as the decision that Firefox made to eliminate the options of not using javascript or loading images, easily the most cavalier and dumbest product decision ever made, but it is difficult to have functionality that users expect suddenly vanish.

William is not planning on appealing but I strongly recommend that someone step in and take the case for him because of the bad precedent that it sets. Just because something "could be" used in a crime is absolutely no reason to not do something. Your action only must satisfy that a) it "could be" used for a lawful purpose, and b) your action was taken so that it "could be" used for those lawful purposes, instead of so that it could be used for illegal purposes. If certainly can not be proven that the node was only operated for the purpose of illegal purposes, because since I use Tor, and never use it for any illegal purpose, it is highly likely that on occasion my traffic was sent through the node William was operating, if I was using Tor at that time. Ditto for the overwhelming majority of other Tor users using Tor only for lawful purposes. Nobody queries me and says "is this for an illegal purpose? If it is I can let it go through, but if it is for a
 lawful purpose I can not let it go through."
As a Tor user, I am dependent on and thankful for node operators such as William.

No, absolutely NOT. Actually, the opposite is the reality. Austria has something commonly called the ?Provider's Privilege? (non-legalese term) which states that a service provider is not liable for the data transported over said services. No matter if the service is a free or paid one.
There is no law that I have ever heard of that prohibits running a proxy server or a Tor node in general or in particular. Providing an online service in Austria is mostly regulated by the Telecommunications law, E-Commerce law and data-protection law.
German language Austrian Legalese background:
Austrian E-Commerce Law ?15: Ausschluss der Verantwortlichkeit bei Zwischenspeicherungen ? 15. Ein Diensteanbieter, der von einem Nutzer eingegebene Informationen in einem Kommunikationsnetz ?bermittelt, ist f?r eine automatische, zeitlich begrenzte Zwischenspeicherung, die nur der effizienteren Gestaltung der auf Abruf anderer Nutzer erfolgenden Informations?bermittlung dient, nicht verantwortlich, sofern er
??? ??? 1. die Information nicht ver?ndert,
??? 2. die Bedingungen f?r den Zugang zur Information beachtet,
??? 3. die Regeln f?r die Aktualisierung der Information, die in allgemein anerkannten und verwendeten Industriestandards festgelegt sind, beachtet,
??? 4. die zul?ssige Anwendung von Technologien zur Sammlung von Daten ?ber die Nutzung der Information, die in allgemein anerkannten und verwendeten Industriestandards festgelegt sind, nicht beeintr?chtigt und
??? 5. unverz?glich eine von ihm gespeicherte Information entfernt oder den Zugang zu ihr sperrt, sobald er tats?chliche Kenntnis davon erhalten hat, dass die Information am urspr?nglichen Ausgangsort der ?bertragung aus dem Netz entfernt oder der Zugang zu ihr gesperrt wurde oder dass ein Gericht oder eine Verwaltungsbeh?rde die Entfernung oder Sperre angeordnet hat.
IANAL Paraphrased:
A service provider who transmits user-input over a communications-network is not liable for a automated, time restricted caching which only purpose is to more effectively provide information requested by a user given that:
??? 1. the information is not altered
??? 2. access requirements are honored
??? 3. commonly accepted rules and industry standards for updating are honored
??? 4. the lawful application of technology to collect data about the usage of information as defined in commonly accepted and applied industry standards is not harmed
??? 5. recorded information is immediately deleted or access to that recorded information is denied as soon as they are informed of the fact that the information has been deleted at it's point of origin, access has been denied or in case a court or regulatory-body(?) has ordered the blocking.
Austrian E-Commerce Law ?3.1: Begriffsdefinitionen: Diensteanbieter
1. Dienst der Informationsgesellschaft: ein in der Regel gegen Entgelt elektronisch im Fernabsatz auf individuellen Abruf des Empf?ngers bereitgestellter Dienst (? 1 Abs. 1 Z 2 Notifikationsgesetz 1999), insbesondere der Online-Vertrieb von Waren und Dienstleistungen, Online-Informationsangebote, die Online-Werbung, elektronische Suchmaschinen und Datenabfragem?glichkeiten sowie Dienste, die Informationen ?ber ein elektronisches Netz ?bermitteln, die den Zugang zu einem solchen vermitteln oder die Informationen eines Nutzers speichern;
IANAL paraphrased:
Definition of Information-Service: A __commonly__ _paid-for_ provided service for individual use by the recipient, especially online-sales of goods and services, online information, onilne advertising, electronic search-engines and data-query as well as ___services that transport information over an electronic network or that provide access to such a network or that store a user's information__. (Emphasis mine)
First instance courts in Austria have been traditionally problematic with highly technical cases since they usually lack technical expertise. Austria does not have case-law, so the danger of this becoming precedent should be rather low.
The latter is very likely the case and I hope to have better (first or second hand) information in the next few days. I won't speculate more until I have talked to a few people who have actual information.
Similarly ridiculous parallels have been drawn. Why not close the postal system and every parcel delivery service as well. :-)

Statement part  on?July 2, 2014?by?Will
As seen possibly?here, or?here?i lost the?Tor?case and was sentenced to 3 years probation (instead of 3 months jail) and all fees (court and experts, Assumption ~30000EUR, not less than 20k for sure).
The sentence is based on??12?which allows for anyone to be dealt with as perpetrator (which is a pretty dictatorial law IMO) and this is based on that i knew it *could* possibly be used for criminal activity (in this case child pornography).
I won?t write much more yet before i have the written ruling (i do not even know my probation terms yet) but merely want to explain why i won?t appeal this sentence:
First would be that I simply can?t afford it anymore, donations covered a lot of lawyer fees but i had to use my entire money on this case as well, i?m now bankrupt and the garnishment (a rare word, DE: Pf?ndung) of my income (to pay the 20k+ costs) does not help with it either. I have high medical costs as well besides which are more important. I?m not really interested in more external funding due to taxation issues with larger amounts (and i do not want *another* crime on me).
Second is that i just want to be done with this, i had now years of ?issues? (i would write ?harassment? but then i get sued again for sure) (Ex: Citing my boss to the police for questioning (x3); physically monitoring my boss in Vienna; citing friends to the police for questioning (x2); confiscation of bank transaction data; Polish extradiction threats for hacking cases there (x2); citing me for useless questioning causing lawyer costs (x5+) etc. etc.) ? It?s now finally over and besides the cost i CAN live with this sentence, it does not show up in police registers and won?t be an issue for work and alike in the future.
Third is the mental component, this years of ?horror? changed a lot up to me being hospitalized (x3?) with paranoid schizophrenia (which was a wrong diagnosis, but still it?s not helpful if you HAVE to assume permanent monitoring of everything), PTSD (among other issues) and now taking medication ? It took it?s toll, including me getting fired for being in the clinic/sick stay for a long time, i just can?t afford to loose my job or go the clinic again even if i actually should be still there.
Fourth is the attention, media and personal ? I don?t really like any attention on myself, especially when others should get it (like some public cause, Pirateparty or alike).
So this is it for now, stay tuned for more in a few days.

Unless your "conviction" or settlement (what ever the legal term in Austria)? for this situation is unusual in the Austrian legal system, the fact of it not showing up on your permanent record, so it won't affect getting work in the future, etc., is QUITE different than in the U.S., for similar "crimes convictions."? Of course, every legal matter & decision is different.
Perhaps it was part of the probation that if you behave, it will be expunged (removed) from your record?
But for *adults* convicted of crimes (certainly ANY thing to do w/ child porn or abuse), it would remain on your record until death.
Sorry, I couldn't load the linked page for "official statement part 1, so didn't get the exact crime they eventually convicted you of.
Maybe your conviction wasn't "child prOn trafficking, but if convicted of the *least* possible crime involving that (or sexual abuse of a minor) in the U.S., it probably will remain on your record.
Unless due to circumstances, a U.S. judge feels your record should be expunged, once probation is fulfilled.? If the law even gives a judge that leeway, for a specific crime.

I agree that collecting stories about "why/how I use Tor" is useful, but I disagree that any special education or warning should be needed before setting up an exit node. Setting up an exit node is simply providing another IP that can be used for traffic and nothing else. It is useful to provide warnings about protecting your own traffic, and protecting your own computer against attack from traffic to your exit node. For a while I was able to set up an exit node and run it for about 4 days at a time before Windows got clogged up and I needed to reboot to keep the computer from locking up. The only thing I had to do was change my IP address, as whatever IP address I was using for Tor gets tagged and blocked by many sites (unreasonably, but still done).
But then I started receiving immediate attacks that shut down the node. I am not sure if those were coming from my ISP or from outside, and I am not interested in notifying my ISP that I am operating an exit node - what I do with my Internet connection is my business, not theirs. I am not the least bit concerned of any legal issues associated with operating an exit node, because any concerns are blatantly unreasonable. Basically Tor, and https, are just necessary mechanisms for using the Internet, and nothing else. Boo hoo that no one can see what you are doing. That is just too bad. Everyone has the right to privacy. I list public key cryptography as the most important invention of the 20th century, because it allows privacy in the digital world. The same privacy that was obtained centuries earlier by sealing a letter with hot wax and a monogram seal.

Definitely!? /"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."/ - Ben Perhaps out of fear of legal liability, Tor Project doesn't seem to have what would be very helpful for relay operators - guides, documents - even access to basic legal advice,? of how to best avoid legal issues to begin with.
I know nothing of legalities surrounding that, but people starting a relay w/o proper guidance on how to avoid legal problems as much as possible, *doesn't quite seem right.*
In a worst case scenario, running relays can be truly *life destroying.*? It seems volunteers need better preparation & education about potential ramifications.? If after being educated, they still choose to run relays (especially exit), that's fine.
However, it would seem wrong to not make reasonably complete education materials available to potential relay operators, to prepare them & warn them of potential downside.
Without relay operators, there won't be much left (unless independent volunteers no longer handle that function).

It also has to be a hollow claim. To actually "deanonymize" someone would mean making a list of every website that was visited by that client. Not just identify one client that visited one website. And how many clients were you planning on doing that with? It would take an NSA size budget not a $3000 budget to try to do that for everyone. And the NSA apparently can not do it for everyone.

Basically we know that Tor is pretty robust, and yes it is being improved. I certainly benefit from using it every day.

This actually depends on what to mean by "Tor". If just the network level part, then yes. But tor project also provides and promotes TBB, which attempts to prevent various client side exploits and web app attacks, but apparently can't prevent all of them. If tor project went one step further, and developed security-by-isolation approach (using virtual machines, like Whonix does), this could prevent practically all client side exploits. And pretty much the only way user could be deanoned is if he himself typed in his personal information, or logged into some service shared with other identities.

Dangers of Tor usage in daily life
In the current debate one often hears the Council, for more privacy and security, one should use the Tor anonymity service.?In fact, however, this is a very dangerous tip.?For normal users, it increases de facto the risk of being watched and spied upon.
V?orweg be said that Tor can be very useful if you know exactly what you're getting into and then behaves accordingly.?For the internet everyday by John Doe Tor, however, about as useful as a shortcut to the supermarket a short cut through a highly toxic swamp.
Tor as anonymizer
T?he misunderstandings begin already with the statement that goal encrypt the transmitted data.?This is true for traffic to and through the Tor network.?But what you put into sending unencrypted Tor, emerges on the other side also unencrypted back out and then is sent in plain text on through the Internet.
In the end gate is increased so that even the risk that third parties read along your data.?To eavesdrop on you, a monitor access to your Internet traffic must first gain - for example with a corresponding warrant to search your provider.?However, that does work and there are rules to be followed.
However, if you use Tor, your Internet traffic comes here with a Tor exit nodes - without any further action and almost as fair game.?And the operator can read anything you do not explicitly encode.?For example, the Swede Dan Egerstad has fished in a short time over a thousand e-mail passwords from the network traffic of his Tor exit nodes - among other things, various embassies and authorities.
The Tor network is operated by volunteers.?As there are no controls, one must assume that a significant part of the Tor exit nodes is operated not by human rights activists, but by intelligence agencies already given the charming man-in-the-middle position.?During normal surfing so there is some risk that your unencrypted traffic is overheard;?if you use Tor, which is virtually certain.
So you have everything that goes through Tor, actively encrypt and himself make proper arrangements to ensure that there is slipping rather than by mistake unencrypted.?And then send over your encrypted data with the best code breakers in the world and say, "grapeshot"
This can work.?At least then, if you are familiar really good, comply with all necessary safety precautions, perhaps because you know that your life depends on it.?After all, nowadays, you can certainly encrypt data so that even intelligence agencies like the NSA it hard nut to crack.
However, if you only in the evening after a busy day do a bit of surfing with a beer, things look different.?Then it can possibly ever happen that you annoyed wegklicken an error message.?That would have you to make you aware that something was wrong with the certificate of the page that you want to just call.?And then have the NSA guys, you have turned a nose you by the collar.
If you're unlucky, there are previously not even an error message.?Because it should probably assume that NSA operates at least an intermediate certification authority with which they can issue as man-in-the-middle certificates that accepts any browser without complaint.?Who can move & Co. to collaborate Microsoft, Apple, Google will not let Certificate editors reject.?Simple SSL encryption of https pages then does not provide sufficient protection.Instead, you have to really the fingerprints of the web pages certificates check - each time.
Active attacks
The connections through the Tor network will also not only passive eavesdropping.?Intelligence agencies and prosecutors consider the Tor users almost as fair game and grab the at will.?A few weeks ago someone has exploited specifically through the Tor network vulnerabilities in Firefox version that came Browser Bundle used almost exclusively in the anonymization package goal.?In this way, a small spy program was funneled to the computers of Tor users.?It all looks as if the part of an FBI campaign for blowing up a child porn ring was.
Overall, the probability that your privacy is sacrificed as collateral damage increases by the use of Tor significantly.?Looking at the advice of the Tor developers on the safe use of their service to, it becomes clear where the journey goes.?Among other things, they put the change from Windows to a special Linux live distribution on DVD to the heart, recommend disabling JavaScript and a random setting the MAC address at every system startup.?The use of Flash and other Extensions is already off limits.?So, go with "still alittle bit rumsurfen, play and have fun" - without a helmet, gas mask and bulletproof vest one has no place in the Tor network.
Meanwhile, there are also real doubts gate at all can still keep the promise of anonymity.?Admin and also conventional criminal pursuer bite of course clear from the teeth.?But if the NSA can actually evaluate substantial portions of the Internet traffic systematically, it offers a lever, this anonymity to crack.?Very roughly simplified to lure the victim to a Web page that reloads other resources such as images.?Size and timing of their packages, then form a pattern that you see on "the other side" of the Tor network and could therefore assign a specific address.
If we add that the data dribble at a snail's pace and with sensible delay through the Tor network, the associated limitations and risks outweighs the benefits for average Joe and his need for privacy on any more.?On the other side stands or falls on the concept so that enough normal Internet users use Tor and thus those who are really dependent on anonymity, so to speak, offer coverage.?Ideally, the dissidents and human rights activists who are being persecuted by their government and really need this protection.?(?)

Obviously, we do need to anonymize and encrypt everything, but also need to adopt a UN resolution protecting the privacy of individuals - no government may intercept any communication without permission or a signed search warrant, which can only be issued on probable cause, and which must specify where to search and what is being sought. Everything else must be discarded.
It is interesting though, that everything that the NSA does is legal for any individual or corporation to do, and illegal for any government. The reason is governments can arrest you and charge you with a crime - individuals and corporations can not.
In New Hampshire, we prohibit automatic license plate recognition, and prohibit government cameras from recording anyone other than (oddly) at three bridges going to Maine (evidently we still have a border war with Maine concerning the ownership of Seavey's Island, home to the Portsmouth Navy Yard), and at toll plazas. At toll plazas we photograph every license plate, and delete any image that includes a person (not many people in motorcycle sidecarts are leaning over that low anyway), and delete within three seconds the image of any plate of anyone who has paid the toll. Red light, and speeding cameras are completely forbidden. Other states are not as protective of its citizens.

If it helps any, the US Constitution, both lists a lot of rights, and in the 9th Amendment says "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." But anyone who takes a course on the Constitution learns that none of the rights we have come from the Constitution - it just enumerates some of the rights that everyone is born with. Everyone means everyone in Australia, everyone in Austria, everyone everywhere.
But it is often said, if you do not know what your rights are, you have none. Rights have to be asserted. Strenuously. Thousands of people have been more than willing to go to prison to assert various rights so that everyone else will have them.

The number of exit nodes also needs to increase commensurately, but it is the users that gives Tor its anonymity. I would love to have someone file a FOIA request, or just ask MIT, exactly how many people other than Eldo Kim were using Tor at the time. My guess is the answer is "no one".
It is unavoidable that the Internet uses a unique source and destination IP address, but Tor breaks the association between source and destination, and really needs to become the default mechanism for all Internet traffic.
So I would start with "Use Tor". And a link to a page that gives examples of people using Tor, including both good and bad uses, and that could start out with, the more people who use Tor, the better.

Evil. "Darklist provides a Norse IPQ risk score for each IP, the risk category (such as 'botnet' or 'Tor proxy') to provide context to the score". Sad to think that some companies will actually pay for this nonsense. If anyone is not using Tor, they should be.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Waiting for a new exit node 
It is really pretty annoying to be surfing along and suddenly get a "Unable to connect
Firefox can't establish a connection to the server" message. Right now I am stuck on?188.226.249.138?as I have been many times before. In ten minutes I will be re-assigned a new exit node and can get back to what I had been doing. With the old Vidalia, though, all I did is click "New connection" or whatever it was called, and not lose even a second. It would be nice to accomodate this problem for the millions of other Tor users, so they 1) know what to expect, and 2) know what to do. On the page "Test Tor Network Settings" I would change that link to "Test Tor", and on  some link to say "Is this exit node working for you? That you could click on to banish it from rotation for a while - instead of a great big blue button that says "Donate to support Tor" I would change that button to say "Report a problem with this IP". Also the link to the Atlas does not do anything in the standard configuration because it
 requires javascript, which is not noted at? have to mysteriously know that if you click "temporarily allow all this page" and refresh the page you will magically be able to see the page.
And now that 10 minutes have elapsed, I am on a new exit node, and all is well again.

Eleven tabs open now. When it affects me the most is when I am filling out a posting - I have no backup of what I was typing, and if I wait ten minutes Firefox will repost it for me, if I get a new browser session, I have to try to remember what I was going to send. Since it tends to catch me by surprise there is not really any way to avoid just waiting the ten minutes. It is just a shame that something that used to be available so easily to everyone has now been removed. But the most annoying thing is getting the same sticky node again and again - and unless there is a super simple button to press to ignore it for say a month, I am not interested in finding a way to add that IP to a config file or something like that.

You could select the onion icon, then select "new identity". However, that will reset your browser as well and this may not workable if you have multiple tabs open.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Pissed off about Blacklists, and what to do? 
This is an astute observation. The correct way to deal with problematic visitors is at the backend, not at the front door. If you have a guestlist that you do not want them to spam, use a captcha or require only registered users to post. If you want to restrict readership, require readers to log in. But blocking a pipeline of Internet users who could be anyone or everyone makes no sense at all.

As a former head of IT for a global company, we made blocking decisions
based on data. Blocking was enabled for targeted attacks for limited
amounts of time. Infected clients were far, far more problematic than
open proxies, vpns, etc. Mass-hosting facilities were far more problematic
than open proxies, vpns, etc. Tor barely came up on the list ever.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Blacklists 
I just complained to a company that I got a 403 from using TBB when I went to their website, and they said they had no control, their webhost was doing it, but passed the information on to them, and this is the response from the webhost:
I checked with the team and our system doesn't specifically block Tor but we do have security provisions in place to detect malicious attacks against the system (such as potential DoS attacks). Given the nature of Tor, it could be that these users are being picked up by the system.?
Are they seeing specific errors (like a 50x error)? We may be able to get a ticket going so that the team can dig in a bit further. ?Also, if they provide their originating IP address, we can check our logs for more details.
This is the site I was trying to reach.?

Use services that don't block Tor. Tell the other operator why you are leaving. Ask admins or poke any adress you find from a website that is important to you, that blocks us, why they are doing so. Tell your friends to use TBB, it's awesome how useable is it nowadays. They should just "click to play" flashplayer and just about anyone can use it. It's the best browser there is. Tor Browsers have to become visible to (still?) friendly website operators.
It's annoying sometimes but overall I know why I'm doing it and I keep doing it. It's tiny steps but the only steps to a situation (maybe) where every private home connection can be an Exit and the Internet doesn't react in any way to it. I'm glad the torproject offers to "discriminate" Tor users, it can be done anyways. I just hope it becomes less and less affordable.

Very neat! My only two cents is that without a stem it didn't look
obviously like an onion to me. First impressions were a globe or a
blue wooden ball. That said, with a stem I think it would be a
fantastic icon.

I would say it greatly depends on the nature of the data. Wikileaks says that "we provide a high security anonymous drop box fortified by cutting-edge cryptographic information technologies. This provides maximum protection to our sources." Although their website does not appear to list any contact information. Snowden went to Hong Kong to release his.

Greetings tortalkers,
I have data with expert guidance which will result in death threats.
Ultimately, we will be killed for releasing this data with expert
guidance. We want to publish this data and stave off impending death for
as long as possible.
Are there field-tested guides for configuring a service in the most
anonymous way possible in order to publish files? I have scoured the
Internet and deep web for the past month and have not found a single
field-tested guide to doing so. We cannot trust a service or others to
carry out this data publication. Pointers are very much appreciated.

Hello everyone!
I'm not sure where to submit unimportant errors in the docs.
Anyways, I noticed that there is an error in the FAQ. It says "Most people who ask us this question don't want to distribute just the Tor software, though. They want to distribute the Tor Browser . This includes Mozilla Aurora  and Vidalia ." Since version 3.x of TBB Vidalia has not been included.
Thats my unimportant error in the docs.
Keep up the hard work on the important errors!
