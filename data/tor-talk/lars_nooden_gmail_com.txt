If I understand it is possible to embed scripts inside SVG and the
decision currently is either to display SVG with any scripts it might
have or else not display any SVG at all.  It would be great to be able
to use SVG but with the possibility of embedded scripts turned off.

At intervals Tor posts some status updates to the system log file:
I see that Tor takes different actions upon catching various signals
(HUP, USR1, USR2, etc).  But none of these signals force a short,
concise status report like is given in the heartbeat.  How can this
heartbeat update be invoked on demand?

@_subject: [tor-talk] ssh over tor 
I'm looking at using netcat to run ssh over Tor.
Does this use of netcat leak information in any way?
 ssh -o ProxyCommand="nc -X 5 -x localhost:9050 %h %p" \
     -o User=user1 server.example.org
Many others must have already looked at this way of connecting since it
is fairly obvious.  The only thing I could think of to test was DNS.  I
blocked DNS at the packet filter and set it to log any outgoing DNS
traffic, and nothing was logged when I ran the test.  So it seems that
it is safe in that regard.  Is it safe in general?
I see one vague reference to it in the archives:
But there is no follow up indicating whether it's good or not.

The "stealth" mode menu is weak on information but it appears that it
simply drops packets instead of rejecting them properly.  When that
happens to you or a service you use, that will impair your ability to work.
There are a lot of reasons to not use drop.  In general you are better
off using reject:

If Tor is listening on an external interface, then you should just need
to open that particular port
  pass in quick on $ext_if inet proto tcp to ( $ext_if ) port 8118
Otherwise, try logging blocked packets and see how it is trying to connect.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Bandwidth Scheduling for Relays 
I have a feature request.  It would be nice for a future version of Tor
to allow scheduling at least one alternate values for RelayBandwidthRate
and RelayBandwidthBurst for a span of time.  This would allow relays to
operate at higher speeds when their host network is normally less active.
One example is from torrent software.  Transmission allows one alternate
speed for one block of time.  kTorrent allows much more complex
scheduling varying by hour and day of week.
However, this is not a high priority compared to some other things.  And
one current workaround is to have multiple configuration files and to
load them with cron.

What are the thoughts on the appropriateness or usefulness of the Tor
Browser Bundle on public desktop computers?
I ask for two reasons.  I notice that there are no packages (APT or RPM)
or for that matter repositories containing the TBB.  That means that
each machine with TBB must be updated manually.  Also, the binaries are
generally both writable by the user and executable by the user.  That
can bring the integrity of the bundle into question on a public station.

DNS queries for non-Tor ssh connections and other activities with the
same tcpdump session.
And CheckHostIP isn't mentioned in the official documentation:

@_subject: [tor-talk] circpathbias.c : Your Guard vs The Guard 
The log messages "Your Guard" make produce confusion,  Looking at the
latest code base I see the string "Your Guard" recurring.
Does this string actually refer to a Guard the user is responsible for
operating and maintaining?  Or does it refer to the guard the Tor client
is connecting to on its first hop in the circuit?  If it is not a guard
operated by the person running the Tor client, then perhaps the string
ought to read "The Guard" instead of "Your Guard".

Yes, "A guard" would also reduce the potential for confusion, and it's
even shorter.  The log error should clearly convey the information of
whose guard is being noted.
The phrase "Your guard" very strongly suggests that the user is
responsible for the guard in question and different but still concise
wording is needed.
