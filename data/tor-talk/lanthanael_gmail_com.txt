@_subject: Excluding domains 
I want to know more about that stuff to exclude domains from the TOR circuits, but I'm an ole SeaMonkey user and FoxyProxy is only for Firefox, are there other Plugins which work with SeaMonkey too? Because I wasn't able to finde stuff on the net how to exclude domains from the onion routing.
Any help will be appreciated, Lanthana?l

Thank you John!
I do not use Privoxy because it crashes all the time on an x64 System instead of it I use CCProxy which supports my needs very well and I think I have to write to the creators of CCProxy for a solution.
Or is it possible to exclude some domains / domain endings in the Torrc Thank you, Lanthana?l

I don't meant it in that way, I want that Tor don't use certain domains e.g. .de, .cn, .us, .com, .net, ,org.

We have a litlle bit missunderstanding. What I mean is that Tor don't use this circuits and that I don't have to configure my browser to don't use Tor for this domains. Tor shoud be able to drop away connections with this domain endings.

I think the subject says its all. If I try to start TOR normaly it dosn't work just as a NT service, if I check the box, run as NT Service everything is well and TOR works, but if I uncheck the box run as NT Service TOR stops working. Why is this in that way?
Here my error log.
M?r 10 14:27:57.140 [Warnung] Could not bind to 127.0.0.1:9050: Permission denied [WSAEACCES ]
M?r 10 14:27:57.156 [Warnung] Failed to parse/validate config: Failed to bind one of the listener ports.
M?r 10 14:27:57.156 [Fehler] Reading config failed--see warnings above.
Every system service is configured propably the firewll and the virus scanner are also configured to let TOR working.
What is this thingy permission denied [WSAEACCES]? And what the hell is this [WSAEACCES]?
My System: Windows Server 2003 Enterprise x64 Edition R2
I searched the web but can't find an answer. So, how do I solve this problem, because I don't want tu run TOR as an system service?
Thenks, Lanthana?l

No, I have just one TOR Service which is controlled by Vidalia.
