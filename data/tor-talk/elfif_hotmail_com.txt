Does anyone have installed TOR on a SMEserver 6.01 ?
I'd like to create a tor server on that system, because it's the one I use..., but I can't find any doc.
Thanks for your help

Hi P.
Many thanks for your reply.
Unfortunately, I can't upgrade to SME7 due to the poor perf of my server...
I hope to buy a new one as soon as possible, but for the moment, I have to continue with SME 6...
Do you think it's possible to adapt your configuration on v6.01 ?
Anyway, your work is really interesting, and yes I'd like to continue this discussion on contribs.org :)
Best regards,
