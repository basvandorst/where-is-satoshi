I think the most annoying thing using TOR are failed downloads. :-(
You try to download a 5MB file and the download stops various times and you
have to start over and over again, crossing all fingers to get the file
As Firefox does not support very good download management, its a pain to
download even small files with TOR.
Is there any add-on or app that can be used without been concerned about
security (Linux)?
I just want a working resume function, nothing else.
Thanks a lot! :-)

Thanks. And I still need the http proxy. I cant do 127.0.0.1:9050, right?

Thanks. I will use something like this:
wget --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101
Firefox/5.0" --proxy --execute=http_proxy= -c

Ups, did not read before sending. Yes I think I will double check with
wireshark. Anybody knows wget very well to answer that question?

@_subject: [tor-talk] TBB and local TOR for Linux users 
I'm a Linux user running TOR normally under the user debian-tor. Like
you suggested, I switched to TBB lately. That brings mi into some
trouble now as my firewall settings are based on the user debian-tor.
I'm not feeling very happy about opening the door for other
application nor running in a VM (nor boot tails). I saw some
workarounds in the past but I'm wondering what the official position
Are there plans to give Linux users the choice to run the installed
version of TOR instead of the TBB one?
If that is not the case, am I doing good by using the local installed
TOR (debian-tor) together with firefox (only) in your bundle?
I'm starting Firefox from the bundle that way:
./App/Firefox/firefox -no-remote -profile ./Data/profile
It seems to work without an issue.Is there any concern running it like this?
Thanks a lot for the great work!
Sam :-)

There is no difference. It's the same Firefox with the same features.
(except 'New Identity' button)
I guess it's not a bad solution if you want to use your local TOR for
any reason.
Maybe someone with deeper knowledge could advise and maybe tell us if
there is a negative aspect!?

It depends on what you need. I don't need Vidalia and it's features
but I want TOR running as a local installed version because I like my
firewall script like it is.

Thanks for the answer Andrew.
I don't understand what protection could be lost when using TBB
Firefox together with a local TOR. Beside the control features that
Vidalia provides nothing should be different. Firefox is using
127.0.0.1:9050 and the local TOR is listening. What protection could
be missed there?

@_subject: [tor-talk] An external application is needed... 
I was always wondering why I get the following pop-up message when
downloading a file. And it does not happen all the time. Why it says that
an external app is needed when only opening the download window?
*An external application is needed to handle:
NOTE: External applications are NOT Tor safe by default and can unmask you!
If this file is untrusted, you should either save it to view while offline
or in a VM,
or consider using a transparent Tor proxy like Tails LiveCD or torsocks.
*Thanks for the help! :-)*

I know what this message means, the question is why it is displayed when
clicking on a download link. And it was not a pdf or something, it was an
example with the TBB on the tor webpage.
Maybe Mike can advise?
Have a great day! :-)
