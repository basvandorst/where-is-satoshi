Hello Karsten and everyone,
I am very happy to be one of the others whose application got accepted
with GSoC. My project is about developing and evaluating new algorithms
for path selection with the aim of improving Tor client performance.
Whoever is interested can have a look at my proposal on the GSoC-page.
My name is Johannes Renner and I'm a student of the RWTH-Aachen
University in Aachen, Germany. Currently I'm working on my master
thesis that will also be focused on improving performance in Tor.
So, who are the others?
