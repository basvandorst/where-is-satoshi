Hash: SHA1
Hello all
I made a unified patch for five of the seven patches mentioned in
I did not apply the MacOSX or FreeBSD patches, partly because I don't
have access to osx or bsd (and therefore can't test them), and partly
because when I applied the bsd patch, configure didn't run on linux anymore.
The new patch is here:
I don't consider myself suitable to work actively in tsocks, but since
the project is dead, with no changes since 2002, I can keep the current
version and apply patches on demand.
I'll have a look at the osx and bsd patches and update them so that they
apply cleanly to 1.8.1 when I have time.

I'll try to update the patch so that it compiles cleanly, and if
somebody tests that it works, we can see which defines to use in
configure to merge the patches.

Do you have access to a bsd machine?
I have never worked in bsd, so I don't know what the standard procedure
to distinguish the systems is.
Would something like
if [uname|grep BSD]
Please test the uname in a bsd, and post the correct invocation.
I'll then unify the sources. The only changes is that the dynamic
library is in -ldl in Linux and in -lc in bsd.
I have not used automake before, so I don't know how to do this in
configure.in. I'll do it directly in configure, as per the bsd patches.
If somebody with access to osx wants to help, we can integrate the osx
patch as well.

Thanks! I'll start the merge this weekend. Sorry about the brackets, I
don't usually program bash and always have to look the syntax up. It was
meant only as an example of what I wanted to do.

I updated Now BSD is detected using the uname. It's working on Linux. Please test
1.8.3 in BSD to see if everything is all right.

Kyle Williams escribi?:
Perhaps it might be possible to tell tor about the router's nat policy
so that if the router is supposed to port forward the external request
to :, tor does it itself.
That way, the problematic
host->tor->tor->your host tor->router->your host web
can become
host->tor->tor->your host tor->your host web
(This requires some changes to the torrc and tor source, so I'd like to
add it to the feature request list in case somebody has free time)

If I remember correctly, you can tell vi on the command line the keys
you'd press inside, and it'll work.
Just insert that in a shell script, plus something to save and exit; done.

I'm seeing the same as well. 11k tcp connections and 1.5GB of memory used
by tor. Router name rXTXo1bxEP.

I thought about avoiding dns queries for hidden services being sent to the
isp dns server, and configured bind9 so that it answered all .onion
queries with nxdomain, in case the proxy fails.

Praedor Atrebates escribi?:
I've been using
while [[1]]; do restart software; sleep 60; done
for programs with memory leaks or other stability problems (not for tor,
since it works fine for me).
Of course, that means connections will die every few hours, but
persistent connections will only hit your node every now and then.
If you are not babysitting the node anyway, a downtime of a couple
minutes every now and then won't hurt you.
P.S. I'm not very sure about the bash syntax, so check it if you find it
