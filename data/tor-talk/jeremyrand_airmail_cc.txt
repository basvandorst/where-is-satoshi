@_subject: [tor-talk] SELinux issue with Tor? 
Someone reported a weird SELinux issue with Tor on the  IRC
earlier today.  I've obtained permission to post a partial chatlog, as
I'm curious if this is intended behavior by Tor.  Chatlog below:
 Someone fucked up Tor in my distro and I can't use it now,
ZeroNet still tries to use the fucked up Tor, so I can't do… anything
 nvm, there's zeronet.conf
 pskosinski, might I ask what distro has a broken Tor?
* Jeremy_Rand_2 wants to make a mental note to avoid that distro like
the plague
 Jeremy_Rand_2: Well, so far I had not much time to check if
it's not reported yet or it's not my fault… Anyway, it seem to not work
well in Fedora 24 after last update
 Anyway, it was working, I did not change anything, updated,
doesn't work, SELinux throws alerts
 pskosinski, oh, that's unfortunate, I use Qubes-Fedora
for some of my stuff.  (although I use Fedora 23)
 pskosinski, although my Tor stuff is running in Whonix
* Jeremy_Rand_2 tries to come up with a justification involving Fedora
being advertised as bleeding-edge, but fails because Tor being bricked
by SELinux should be really easy to notice in QA
 According to SELinux tor wants to mount a filesystem on
 Do I have NSA-version of tor or what
 So seems good that SELinux is preventing that, the question
why is tor trying to do that
 pskosinski, lemme get this, a security system created by
NSA is stopping a suspected NSA-backdoored version of software created
by the Pentagon from operating
 I love the world of infosec these days
 ;p
 It's better than fiction
Sincere apologies if this behavior is documented somewhere already.
(Also, my reference to onion routing being created by the Pentagon was
purely commentary on how the field of infosec is more interesting than
fiction -- I'm already aware that Tor isn't backdoored by the Pentagon,
please don't think that I was implying that.)
Anyway, if anyone might be able to comment on whether this is intended
behavior, what the purpose is, and whether anyone else has encountered
this issue in Fedora (or any other distros), that would be greatly

Lots of things are trivially easy and extremely common, that I choose
not to do out of politeness (not for security reasons).  Posting
chatlogs of other people is one of them.  No implication of
secrecy/deniability was intended.
I had never heard of this "Google" thing; are you telling me that all
the information of the world can be obtained by average me just by
figuring out what incantation of search terms to type in?
(Of course, perhaps a link to information that actually answers my
inquiry without me needing to guess the incantation would be even more
Who said anything about selective funding?  I simply was aware that
there are a number of people who regularly accuse Tor of being
backdoored, and I wanted to make certain that my joke wasn't miscontrued
as one of those statements, since text-based communication is frequently
miscontrued.  As a developer who has decided not to pursue certain
funding sources due to "selective funding" issues that I find ethically
concerning, I am certainly well aware of those issues.

@_subject: [tor-talk] A community concern that needs to be addressed, 
Roger Dingledine:
Hey Roger,
First off, I fully agree with everything you've said here, especially
the part about how having a technically sound anonymity system isn't the
only battle that needs to be fought here.  I also fully agree with what
Griffin said -- my confidence in Tor (although already very solid
beforehand) has increased substantially based on how this issue has been
If I might give some hopefully constructive feedback on this, though:
while it is very important for more usable solutions to be available and
widely advertised on the website (since these solutions are the ones
that increase the anonymity set the most), I feel like a neglected
minority is the set of users who were sufficiently technically skilled
to run Tor Browser Bundle back when it was difficult to use, and whose
technical skill makes them now able to run more complex (though more
secure) systems like Qubes-Whonix.  I feel like this is a legitimate
point made by the Reddit poster -- it would be great for the Tor website
to provide links to more complex systems like Qubes-Whonix, perhaps near
the bottom of the download, and with a note that such systems are are
intended for technically savvy users and will be harder to use, but aim
to provide more security against sophisticated attackers than TBB can.
People like myself, who are more than capable of using Whonix, learned
about it from other sources (e.g. this mailing list), and I'm sure there
are plenty of people with my level of technical sophistication who don't
have the time nor interest to read a mailing list for that info.
Now, I realize that it's easy for me to say this, and that writing such
additions to the website in an accessible way is more difficult.  So,
hopefully no one takes this as grumpiness in any way -- I love the focus
on usable solutions getting the spotlight -- but maybe some kind website
maintainer could give some love to the minority of users who are totally
okay with going through some extra usability issues in order to get
better anonymity?  Even some blogposts would be great -- perhaps some of
the projects like Tails, Qubes, Whonix, and Subgraph might be willing to
collaborate with Tor on some blogposts explaining how the threat models,
usability, and intended audiences differ?  (I imagine quite a lot of the
material could be condensed from the Logan CIJ panel "Future of OS".)

I'm curious what the advantage is in this respect of .onion compared to
using TLS with manual fingerprint verification.
My best guess is that .onion has better usability today with current
tools.  But it seems to me that it wouldn't be incredibly hard to
produce a SOCKS proxy to support a ".tlsexplicit" TLD where the SOCKS
proxy drops the connection to "
if the server doesn't present a TLS cert that matches .
If we accept as a premise that location-anonymity isn't desired, and
that all we want is the integrity/authencitity/encryption properties
that .onion gives you, wouldn't .tlsexplicit be a lot more efficient and
a lot less complex?

I try to do a Google Search, I get a CAPTCHA (and if I try to complete
the CAPTCHA, I usually fail many times).
So I'm rather surprised to hear that other Tor Browser users are having
trouble with Google Translate.  Admittedly, I'm not a heavy user of
Google Translate, but it sounded like hikki was saying that they were
always blocked, which doesn't match my experience at all.
I'm really curious if there's some other interesting variable that could
explain the discrepancy that we're not thinking of.  But given that Tor
Browser is intended to be non-fingerprintable, I'd think there shouldn't
be any such variables.

If Tor Browser complains that "Firefox" can't find the configured proxy,
that presumably means that Tor Browser can't talk to Tor.  Tor Browser
Bundle is supposed to run both Tor and Tor Browser when you run it... so
it sounds like Tor may have failed in some way.  Or perhaps a firewall

be 127.0.0.1:9150).

I won't claim to know whether this is a good idea, but one other option
is to only have Tor in Debian Sid.  My understanding is that this is
already done for some Bitcoin-related software, because the Bitcoin
packagers refused to guarantee that their packages would work through
testing/stable's lifespans (due to the chance that consensus forks will
break old clients, which has happened before and could easily happen
again).  It seems plausible that a similar path could work for Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Continuous Integration for testing application proxy 
Hash: SHA512
Just to be clear, the intention here isn't to block proxy leaks, only
to detect them.  I strongly doubt that Travis CI or similar
infrastructure cares about being deanonymized.  Also, "real-world
usage" isn't feasible to automate in CI tests; the main intention is
to identify accidental code that doesn't use the desired proxy, as
soon as it's committed to a project repo or submitted in a pull
request.  Detecting or blocking code that can be exploited to bypass a
proxy is out of scope for my interest.
I suspect that detecting without blocking is actually better than
blocking for this use case, because blocking packets would interfere
with the remainder of the test (and therefore make it difficult to
tell whether any additional leaks were made undetectable by the change
in program behavior caused by the initial leak being blocked).
Hope I'm making sense, and apologies if my initial post was unclear.

My understanding is that the communication between circuit hops has

and a Tor onion service (not just the forward secrecy existing between
adjacent hops).  Or, put another way -- if the machine hosting a
hidden service is compromised after data is exchanged, *and* some/all
of the Tor relays on the circuit were compromised prior to the data
being exchanged, is it feasible for the adversary to decrypt the data
being exchanged?

Has anyone tried using continuous integration tools like Travis CI to

the existing unit/integration tests for the application, wrapped in
something like:
strace -f -e
and use grep on the resulting output to find any results that connect
to anything other than the configured proxy. (This assumes that the
application has good test coverage already.) I'm curious if someone
has already tried to tackle this, or if there's a better way.
(H/t to pabouk at  for the idea of

carlo von lynX:
This is not necessarily the case.  There exist threat models (e.g.
Whonix-style situations) where the Tor daemon and the application are in
separate trust domains, and in those threat models, there is an
advantage to using TLS combined with onion (compared to only onion),
because TLS is terminated in the application rather than the Tor daemon.

Hash: SHA512
J.S. Evans:
Hi Jason,
As Nicolas mentioned, I'm working on getting Tor Browser's rbm build
system to build for non-x86 Linux targets.  My first target is 32-bit
ARM, which will probably be followed by ppc64le (mainly because those
are the two targets for which I actually have hardware to test with),
but I do intend to do 64-bit ARM and ppc64be after that.
Longer-term, I intend to try to support non-x86 host architectures as
well.  In theory there's no reason why building on multiple host arches
wouldn't yield the same hashes for the same targets (any diff would be
an indication of a compiler or build system bug), so this would improve
Tor's reproducible build situation a lot since the x86 architecture
would no longer be trusted in terms of compile-time backdoors.  I'm
designing my current patches with this longer-term goal in mind.
I should note, however, that my efforts on this are basically a
weekends-only hobbyist project, so progress is of varying speed based on
my varying free time during weekends.
I'm happy to answer any questions you might have on this list, if you're
concerned that asking questions in the Trac thread would harm the
signal-to-noise ratio there.

torrio888 at 420blaze.it:
Unless I'm missing something about the threat model, this is basically
the same attack that already applies to all the other Tor bridges (with
the exception of Meek bridges, which are a very different beast).  China
can try to enumerate Snowflake bridges via Sybil-attacking the bridge
distribution mechanisms in the same way that they can try to enumerate
any other non-Meek bridges.
The main benefit of Snowflake against this threat model compared to
other bridge types is that Snowflake bridges are more likely to be on
dynamic IP addresses and are more likely to have intermittent
availability.  Both of these factors mean that Snowflake bridges have
substantially more "churn", which means they resist enumeration attacks
substantially better than the other bridge types.  (You may recognize
this advantage as one that a previous bridge type, Flash Proxy, also
had.  Snowflake is similar to Flash Proxy in this sense, but doesn't
suffer from the UX issues that caused Flash Proxy to be deprecated.)
(Full disclosure: I'm not super familiar with the details of Snowflake,
so maybe I've made errors in the above.  Anyone who's more knowledgeable
about Snowflake is encouraged to correct any errors in what I stated, if
there are any,)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Testers Wanted: Human-meaningful onion service names via 
Hi Tor community!
As we all know, onion services have rather unwieldy randomly derived
base32-encoded names.  This is, of course, a reasonable design, given
the design constraints that onion services have to deal with.  And it
works pretty well, all things considered.
That said, the unmemorable names are also a UX problem, especially for
users who are new to Tor and therefore are accustomed to DNS.  Many Tor
users don't consistently check .onion services' names for correctness,
which introduces the risk of phishing attacks.
So, the Namecoin developers and the Tor Browser developers are running
an experiment, and we'd love to get some feedback from the community.
The currently available Nightly builds of Tor Browser (currently only
GNU/Linux) include optional support for using Namecoin as a naming layer
for onion services.
To try it out, once you have a Nightly version of Tor Browser for
GNU/Linux installed, try running it with the environment variable
"TOR_ENABLE_NAMECOIN=1".  The following domains can be used to test the
These domains are held by Namecoin community members who are happy to
donate them to the "rightful" owners on request.  However, since they
haven't been donated *yet*, don't rely on these domains for security
(e.g. you should *not* use this to submit documents to The Intercept).
For somewhat more detailed instructions (e.g. if you don't know how to
get a Tor Browser nightly build, or if you don't know how to set
environment variables), see my workshop notes from the 36C3 Critical
Decentralization Cluster:
Like any experiment, this experiment is only as good as the feedback we
get.  So, if you try it out, please let us know how it goes!  Specifically:
* If it works well for you, please let us know via this thread on the
tor-talk mailing list.
* If you find a bug or otherwise have suggestions for how we could
improve it, please let us know via this thread as well.  (Or, if you're
comfortable with Trac, you can report it as a ticket on Trac; please use
the "Tor Browser" component and add "namecoin" to the keywords list so
that the right people notice the ticket.)
If you're curious about the behind-the-scenes work that went into this
(and you're not afraid of technical details), my talk at the 36C3
Critical Decentralization Cluster may be interesting to you.  See the
