You can install tor daemon so that applications like Thunderbird dont
have to depend on TBB. Its a standalone service and will start running
on system start. This way, you can also configure other applications to
work through Tor Proxy.
Please note that Tor daemon probably listens on 9050 port and hence you

experienced Tor user to confirm if what I have suggested is the right
way to go.
