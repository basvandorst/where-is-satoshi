The standard TBB does not work because Ethiopia is currently fingerprinting and
dropping both, the TLS client and server hello. More details are available here:
However, there are slightly modified bridges which can circumvent this block and
make Tor usable from within Ethiopia. (You'll get such a bridge by writing to
"help at rt.torproject.org".)

Sounds like a "human rights worm". Some people thought about that before [1].
Aside from the obvious ethical difficulties, I would consider such a worm as
highly problematic because it works in the "interest" of an independent project
and would eventually damage its reputation (just think about how the media would
interpret it). And a damaged reputation might decrease Tor's user diversity
which, on the other hand, would hurt anonymity.

It shows that adversaries who are willing and able to modify their routing

To me this sounds like a good idea. There are many people out there
(activists, journalists, ...) who are in need of some security advice.
Is anyone aware of an organization which provides such services for free?

You might get rid of some problems but introduce a whole bunch of new problems.
If you connect to the AWS instance using Tor, for example, Amazon could do
end-to-end correlation for some users by setting up entry guards or bridges.
Also, the stuff you do inside the AWS instance could leak your identity (key
stroke timing, ...). So Tor's distributed trust would get reduced to trusting a
service provider.

Actually, you can learn quite a bit about the application protocol when only
looking at the TLS handshake.  There's the client cipher list, TLS options,
certificates etc.  All these pieces can tell you a lot about the application.

Over the years, countries such as Iran and China became quite good at spotting
Tor by just looking at the handshake.  Some more info:
Telex' biggest problem is a political rather than a technical one: why would
ISPs run the code if it doesn't benefit their business?

I would imagine such a certificate to be quite misleading.  Even
professional code audits never catch all bugs.  So it would only
be a matter of time until one of these "Tor certified" products
would fail horribly which would then provoke reactions along the
lines of "but... it was certified?".
Also, audits are one time snapshots.  The very first commit
after the certification process might already introduce new

Sure, fully agreed.  I just don't think that a certification
process is the right way towards that goal.

@_subject: [tor-talk] ScrambleSuit is ready for testing: help needed! 
Over the past months, we have been working on the ScrambleSuit pluggable
transport protocol [1].  The code has now reached some maturity and it's time
to test it!  I set up a dedicated bridge and compiled a set of installation
instructions listed below.  You get bonus points if you test the bridge from
within China since ScrambleSuit should resist the GFW's active probing attacks.
There are probably still some hidden bugs.  If you stumble upon something
unexpected, please file a trac ticket or reply to this email.
So here are the installation instructions.  I tested it on Debian wheezy but it
should work just fine on other Linux distributions.
1. Two additional Python packages are necessary: gmpy and yaml.  Debian has
   them under the names "python-gmpy" and "python-yaml".
2. Clone and compile the current Tor-git (or use a version of your choice as
   long as it is >= v0.2.5.0-alpha-dev):
   $ git clone 3. Clone the current version of pyptlib (or use a version of your choice as
   long as it is >= 0.0.5):
   $ git clone 4. Clone a modified version of obfsproxy which contains the scramblesuit
   branch:
   $ git clone -b scramblesuit    $ cd obfsproxy/
   $ git submodule init
   $ git submodule update
5. You can use the following torrc:
   ------
   DataDirectory /tmp/scramblesuit-torclient
   SOCKSPort auto
   UseBridges 1
   Bridge scramblesuit 193.10.227.195:9002 password=5TYVADJINHBB67PJSBPSWVR5IO742PVO
   ClientTransportPlugin scramblesuit exec /bin/obfsproxy \
      --log-min-severity=debug \
      --log-file=scramblesuit-client.log \
      managed
   ------
6. Now start Tor over ScrambleSuit by executing:
   $ PYTHONPATH=: \
   /src/or/tor -f [1]

How about changing "Your browser..." to "This browser..."?
I believe that Andrew once reported that some users interpret "your browser" as
"my most favourite browser on my system".  The string "this browser" sounds
less ambiguous to me.

I just iterated over all active exit relays and used Python's urllib2.urlopen()
to hit check2.torproject.org.  I found 15 relays where check2 told me that I'm
not using Tor.  It gave me the following IP addresses (when using Atlas to
search for them, you might have to discard the least significant byte as some
of them are multi-homed):

Right.  They can most certainly not prevent users from re-connecting to Tor.
In general, they can also not de-anonymise anyone.  Note however, that they are
able to figure out your identity if you give it to them, i.e., by posting stuff
on the unencrypted Internet under your real name.
