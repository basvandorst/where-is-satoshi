I'm a researcher with some experience in formal methods
( and also software development
( in different kinds of programming languages.
I actually question whether your criteria is extensive enough.
Especially from crypto systems and anonymity systems, I'd want to have
a proper specification of the protocol, either by writing it in a
logic system or by using a declarative programming language.
In my experience, code with lots of shared mutable data (such as
object-oriented and imperative programming) tends to produce usable
applications quickly, but once you want to go
multi-core/multi-threaded or extend at points not thought upfront, the
code becomes messy and really hard to maintain. Thus I'd go for some
functional programming language where you write most of the time code
which does not mutate the heap.
Another piece of thought is this static typing vs dynamic typing.
While the latter produces prototypes quickly, the former results in
much more confidence that the application will actually do the right
thing (again, static typing is not a replacement for testing).
Your fourth point can be mitigated by a) two compilers to
cross-bootstrap [ and/or b)
formalised and small runtimes.
At the time being I'd suggest to look into OCaml/Haskell/Erlang or
Idris (if you need a really expressive type system), maybe write
specifications upfront in Coq/HOL/Lem. I don't see any reason these
days to use C/C++ or another unsafe macro-assembly language (and
currently develop a TLS stack in pure OCaml to run with openmirage.org
Happy hacking,

Agreed. I use the Caml part of OCaml. :)
But if you have a chance to start from scratch, you should look at
possible solutions and use a viable one. Especially the readability
and maintainability of a programming language should be considered.
Otherwise you end up with a piece of code which is not maintainable
once the PhDs have graduated. You have to pay the technical debt at
some point. And I'm not sure how to hand over a research project to
'the open source community'... Are there best practices/guidelines
I think the OCaml community is rather larger compared to other
functional programming languages, and it is very helpful. Both the
real world ocaml book, available online and their package management system OPAM, are awesome contributions
over the last years to easily start with OCaml and to get more people
