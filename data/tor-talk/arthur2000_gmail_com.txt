@_subject: NTLM proxy support needed 
Hello TOR developers,
Please add a function of NTLM authorization (domain authorization)
proxy support, because in my lan environment the fascist proxy maybe
MS proxy which needs not only the username/password but also domain.
I've tried to use "domain\username" as username but it doesn't work.
Fortunately, I found a software named "NTLM Authorization Proxy
Server" which is a proxy-like software, that will authorize client at
MS proxy server and at web servers (ISS especially) using MS
proprietary NTLM authorization method (it can change some values in
client's request header so that those requests will look like ones
made by MS IE). Thus the NTML proxy looks like a basic or non
authorization proxy. It is written in Python language so it's a open
source software (
So, would TOR developers please consider adding this function with
referrence of the source code metioned before?
Best regards,

Yes, that's the way I've used, nesting TOR with NTLMAPS, quite ok.
Do you have plan let TOR support NTLM parent proxy?

@_subject: cached-directory update always failure via proxy 
Hello TOR developers,
There is a problem existing long time that the cached-directory
almostly can not be updated via parent fascist proxy.
The detail:
Environment:LAN, fascist http/https proxy, remote port only 80, 443 allowed.
When using tor.exe -httpsproxy 127.0.0.1:8888 -fascistfirewall 1
-firewallports 443, see following:

And I find something in the firewall monitor that TOR not only connect
proxy but also try to directly connect to some remote servers' IP port
9001/9030 although parent proxy is declared. But very very few times,
when using tor.exe -httpproxy 127.0.0.1:8888 -fascistfirewall 1
-firewallports 80, TOR can successfully download the latest
Can you give some explanations or it's a real problem of proxy support?
Best regards,
