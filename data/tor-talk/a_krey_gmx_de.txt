Normal people in developed countries who use tor to
  a) provide the background noise for the users that need protection,
  b) use it as a way around lack of WLAN security or other funny
     ideas of mobile interneter providers,
  c) protect themselves against government agencies who think
     accessing part of *their* content is suspicious by itself.
Count me in on a) and b).

Having the IP fixedly assigned to the tower would be rather stupid -
you couldn't roam very far without losing the IP address. (I assume they
do the usual internal tunneling for roaming in that case.)
Here in germany, the providers just made different choices whether to
assign a public IP or a NATted private one, independent of the kind
of access (after all, there is also handover between 2G and 3G).[1]
A tor client just works (apart from the fact that intermittent
connectivity doesn't play well with tor's timeouts); no way to be a
router, though.
They don't have much more relevant logs than the usual provider (which
only needs the IP address to be able to point to a specific user).
The NAT is an interesting thing by itself: Usually, interested parties
will only come up with an IP address to track down someone, and then the
NATting provider has the problem that there are multiple users behind that
addresse. Having logs of every NAT translation doesn't help much, because
usually the interested party does not have the source port number used.
[1] Experience with 3G and actually moving around is...mixed.

Erm, how *do* you 'explore' hidden services? After all, they are

Not impossible; but even if they start intercepting the relay
communication that data (and no small amount of it) is still sitting in
disparate systems and needs a) the software to actually do the correlation
and b) the means of all data being moved to one place.
Buying software for a) will probably show up in public records, and b)
may be hindered by the paranoia of the participating LEAs. Even the software
needed to get all the intercepted data in one place could be nightmarish.

Of course. Exit nodes are scarce, and 'normal' relays (at least mine)
did pick up quite some traffic after a few days.
They are announced, just not all to the general public. You have to tell
your tor client to use bridges; normally it directly talks to (public) relays.
I think it's a relatively small fraction that is actually using bridges;
if yours ended up in the pool for manual/social distribution it may
take some time until anybody comes around.
I don't think it is a good idea to twitter the address. :-)

Hi all,
I'm occasionally seeing bursts of that in my log:
    Jul 08 08:37:59.000 [warn] Your computer is too slow to handle
    this many circuit creation requests! Please consider using the
    MaxAdvertisedBandwidth config option or choosing a more restricted
    exit policy.
I already have
  RelayBandwidthRate 50 KB  # Throttle traffic to 100KB/s (800Kbps)
and newly
  MaxAdvertisedBandwidth 40 KB
in my tor.rc but the latter did not help against these messages.
This is not an exit relay. (There are a few hidden services on
it whose .onions are not made public.)
This time I only stumbled over that because of how
the traffic on my DSL link looked:
  Which is not the usual burst of tor traffic as incoming traffic is
more than twice the outgoing (red is total, not incoming).
I took a short tcpdump of the connection and noticed that there is
traffic from a number of high-bandwidth tor relays, not just one
single source.
I'd guess there is
 - either something running amok and trying to build circuits
   via a lot of different intermediate relays all through my node
   (or possibly other nodes as well; I can monitor only this one).
 - or this is done on purpose for some reason.
So, the question is: Is there something fishy or something buggy
going on here? Or neither, but then what is that?
Btw, does an non-exit relay only try to build circuits to known
other relays or can it be steered to other IP addresses/ports
by the circuit initiator?
There is also an old ticket on this topic:
This is 0.2.3.12-alpha running on a pretty lowly AMD Geode 500 MHz.

The vertical grid lines are twentieths of a day, or 72 minutes each.
The incident did thus go over 3 hours before I shut down the node.
I already reactivated it because there were lots of SYNs coming
in for the node; there is no more traffic now.
...and a few more, it seems, mostly concerned with rate-limiting
the messages.

Nope. The DSL router is NetBSD/sparc, and it doesn't NAT; the tor relay
machine has its own public IP, so many TCP connections don't consume
ressources on the router. Earlier occurrences of this were dealt with
at most a restart of the tor process.
The problem seems to be that circuit setup requires much more CPU
than regular connection processing, and there seems to be no way
of limiting the number of circuit setups I am willing to do (except
that the CPU itself won't process more).
I'm more interested in why I get smothered in circuits all of a sudden.
One thing I notice: When I open a connection to a hidden service, the
first thing is a frenzy of circuit building; probably to find/reach
a rendezvous point. Do I just happen to get elected as a rendezvous
point for a popular hidden server?

But the web server isn't slowed down/stopped by not sending ACKs but
rather by reducing the window size to zero. ACKs are still sent as
data is received (moduly shortly delaying acks for other reasons).
This is all done within the TCP stack which does all this ACK and

The purpose of the remark was get any concrete information on the
kinds of attack you were experiencing. If those are the same that
everyone on the internet is getting then it is hardly a sign of
you being under attack specifically after having accessed your
own hidden service.
Did you run the server before (I suppose not) and have the firewall
rules before so you could cross-check the attacks after the hidden
service with the time before?
I just operate a few http servers that have practically no regular
traffic, so my httpd logs are a pure trace of the vulnerabilities
that linger in diverse popular web applications.
Likewise I see the constant influx of windows RPC/messages/RDP stuff
in my firewall logs; and I wonder whether you actually know what
life on the internet is, or whether you simply installed the web
server & hidden service, saw all the shit hitting the server and
went 'omg, tor is obviously borken'.
So, what *are* the details of the traffic, especially in comparison to
the usual background, that can even indicate that there was a specific
attach on your server at that time.
Or, for instance, what are the signs I should be looking for in my
firewall/httpd logs to see whether there was a similar attack on
my systems after I started my hidden services.
Yeah, sure. I can research how you were specifically attacked. Care
to give some google keywords for that?
So what? The question is not whether someone is doing that, the
question is what makes you think you're getting these attacks
a) in relation to your hidden service and b) they are happening
only to you.
Yeah, sure. I get the same of every http server I have in the open
internet. Someone is always sweeping the internet for vulnerable
systems; the vulnerabilities change, the sweeping doesn't.

That is done by tor's socks proxy - you need to have the client leave
the hostname resolution to the proxy instead of doing the DNS lookup
itself and only passing down the IP address.

either a way to identify those jerks (obviously
impossible given tor's properties), or identify
the good guys coming in via tor (which is something
we might not want to, re anonymity).
The only idea that comes to my mind is a reputation
system, but how do you tell apart the cooperative
newbie from the fivehundert accounts of the jerk
initially? (Reputation needs to be built into
a site, see stackoverflow.com, i guess. Reputation
is also 'I already have an account', but the question
how to allow to get one via tor without opening up for

potential loss of input outweighs the binding of maintainer's

IP addresses are unsuitable for sessions anyway - multiple users

stay on the same address (tor users, again mobile devices)
Do you mean 'within a session' or 'recognize a user in a new session

For the latter: No. That's kinda the point. (You may be successful

you (the adversary, that is) can see the guard's aggregated traffic,

It's not the binary.
That depends on whether your tor binary is build with shared libraries;
'otool -L path/to/your/tor' will show which libraries it uses.
(Apart from that the Macos libraryes may be patched by apple
from the original openssl.org versions.)
Install new versions of the openssl libs as soon as apple provides
them when you use the ones from the system. Then you (probably)
need to recompile tor itself and make sure that it references the
proper version of openssl libraries.
tor, when started, also tells the openssl version in the first message.
You may also download and compile openssl yourself and link
against that version, but I can't just write down how to
do that - there are some macos specials to find out to do
that, and I didn't yet.

That won't help that much over Tor because you'd also need to
let the data go over differnet circuit, as the relays multiplex
all their traffic onto a single (or two?) TCP connection per pair of relays.
You can only hope that those aren't that affected by either packet
loss or rate limiting by the relays themselves. But then, it's

No, it doesn't. The requirement is for access ISPs to log the association
between user and ip addresses over time, and for email/voip providers
to log all mail transfer/voip connections. Access providers are not
required to log each individual TCP connection, and that would be needed
for finding out even regular guard users.
This, to the extent that it is actually true (namely that you can
correlate the times a person is online with the times a given persona
seems to interact with a webservice), is valid for any possible

How? A user can only interact with a service while he is online ->
correlate user online times with service usage times of a given persona

...as soon as the other side sends something and then doesn't get the acks;

Your server always sees requests from 127.0.0.1 and everything works. ;-)
(The server only ever sees the addresse from where the hidden service
node is; obviously it can't see the actual client IP.)
The model of using the IP address (among others) to distinguish users is
broken anyway - mobile users may change addresses occasionally, and
the other way round multiple users (esp. mobile again) can appear
from the same address thanks to the marvels of NAT.
You were talking about hidden services in the subject; what you discuss
here is your regular web service being accessed via tor. If we're
talking about the latter you should (as always) offer the service
on https, not http, and the question of stealing the login cookie
becomes academic.
If you're not using https, you're simply careless towards any user
of your service as the cookie is transferred in plaintext - any
open WLAN allows to sniff, as well as any rogue exit node operator
can intercept any login cookie that passes its node in HTTP.
If you're actually offering a hidden service the traffic is
encrypted end-to-end even for plain http: URLs.

is a pretty picture somewhere but I don't know it.

Hi all,
datapoints: The last week twitter (via tweetdeck.twitter.com)
looked normal. I could log in and see my feed, but I couldn't
post anything any more ('suspicious activity'). Once I got
blocked and needed to use a mailed password token.
An acquaintance retried an account he had used some time
ago, and it is now logged and requires to immediately
add a phone number to send an unlock key.
His account was only ever used via tor, mine is used
only via tor for years, and from my iphone.
This all feels very stupid.

No, I just don't want to use twitter directly
from workboxes etc.
Here it seems a bit of an interaction between
tweetdeck and twitter itself. Tweetdeck
lets me in but not post, and when I log
into the original twitter UI it tells
me to change password. I don't know
whether there is a time where posting
doesn't work but I'm not told to change
PW either and just cannot post.
Stupid but bearable, all in all.
I've already done something similar. There
is a hosting (shell account, actually) provider
here in germany who accepts payments via mail,
which means I can do ssh -D via tor to there,
and use their IP towards twitter. Account
was stable.

Er, no. SINA is to protect the connection from the provider
to the agency (which is going over the internet), essentially
hardware VPN boxes. The provider still sets up what to feed
into that box, based on written orders from the agency
(which contains subscriber identification and the destination
in the SINA VPN).
That is LI; I don't know what the secret services are doing.
In contrast, in russia (and probably many other countries)
selecting subscribers to be targeted is done directly
over the wire (the interface generically called X1), and
in russia ISP aren't even allowed to look who is tagged.
That is still LI, it is just the russian value of 'L',
and the questions how legal the target selection is
in absense of control by the ISP or a judge.

Also, tor then has a chance to gracefully shut down circuits so
that at least short-lived connections don't break by the shutdown.
If a socket is stuck in FIN_WAIT_2 then the connection is half-closed,
the local side has sent its FIN and got the ACK, but the other side
didn't close its direction by sending its FIN.
It doesn't actually matter whether the tor process is still alive or
not - the kernel keeps the socket existing even when tor has terminated.
The only reason why keeping tor around for a bit helps here may be
that, when shutting down, it sends some sort of close message that
causes the other side to close as well, and it doesn't when it is
hard-killed, *and* the other side then won't shutdown the socket.
Would surprise me for tor-tor connections.
The fun part is that strictly there can be no timeout on FIN_WAIT_2. The
other side is still permitted to send data, and to do so infinitely long.
Practially, there often is a timeout.

Currently, an application stream (say, an ssh session) exists within

so will the application stream. If you want the application stream to
survive this, first it must not be the exit that fails because then the
TCP connection to the destination is lost, and you need to buffer data
that might be lost in the broken circuit - if you want to deal with
failures in one layer you must implement retransmission on the next layer.

This is simply the default setting, I guess. CF isn't just
a abuse shield, it is first a CDN. There are sites where
there is nothing relevant to harvest, and there are sites
where there is, but they all use couldflare for different

Users != Traffic.
Quite probably.
Tell that the authors of the software this mailing list is for.
Tracking is not cloudflare's business, it's the business of the site owner.
Not as easily as just using cloudflare as a front. Heck, my colleague
has cloudflare in front of one of his sites, even though there was
probable more traffic for setting that up than the site on a good day.
Yes. That would lock out the entire exit, and with the crawling
density this apparently basically never gives tor users access.
This is also what cloudflare does, just over longer time, and
giving a captcha instead of an reject.
Crawlers would immediately get smart and stretch their requests out?

as not too many people do it.
The problem is that the chinese have enough manpower to

TBB works right out of the box. Dear casual reader, please don't be alarmed by this post.
You fail to indicate what research is needed, and for that matter why.
Well yes, that is the point. TBB is something a user starts.
How do you want to run a browser in a service (and for that matter,
what even is a 'service' under unix)?
How is that specific to tor?
Wat? The only thing tor connects to are either some guards, or some
bridges, and at least for the former there is no way to predict what IP
addresses or ports they have.
The question is what you want to achieve with iptable rules regarding
tor. tor does only do outbound connections, and those are to unpredicable
addr/ports, and the question is what you want iptables to prevent. If you
have a good tor there is nothing to protect against, and if you somehow
got a subverted tor, it will not be as stupid as to use separate outbound
TCP connections for phoning home, but instead do that through tor.
So basically, while you could go on and download the consensus to find
out what addresses tor should be able to connect to, you can just as well
trust it do to exactly that.
What do you mean with 'failure of default port specification'?
Huh? Create separate account, run tbb there via 'ssh -X account .../tor-browser-me/Browser/start-tor-browser'?

Ok, s/alarmed/overly alarmed/. :-)
The problem, even with the FBI's NIT, is not that tor needs to run
firewalled, but rather that firefox needs to be denied anything but the
SOCKS port (and X11, on unix).
Windows services are iffy as they are. :-( And otherwise this
is too much distro-dependent (and too much dependent on the
wishes of the operator) to provide a click-through installer.
I.e. to some extend you need to know what you are doing there.
I have to 'admit' that I have a TBB instance running
partially so I can use putty to reach hidden services.
Yes, but it wasn't tor that was subverted, it was the browser. And
the subversion was needed to locate the victim, not to phone home
the result of the location.
Basically, what we'd want to do is to isolate firefox, by iptables
or by putting it (but not tor) into a container without network
access - but either of these may not be available to a normal
user installing TBB - and then there is windows.
Interesting, but not quite right. It isolates the browser
from the system, but not from the network.

I have (since last week) two installations of the alpha browsers, both on
win7. The update of yesterday failed for both of them, first saying that
the incremental update could not be applied, then the full update couldn't
be either ('The Update could not be installed (patch apply failed)').
Nonstandard thing: I changed extensions.torlauncher.control_port and
network.proxy.socks_port to be able to run the alpha in parallel with
the standard TBB.
Aside: I would like a distinction between alpha and stable TBB that
is a bit more obious and mnemonic than the location of the noscript button
(to the left in alpha, to the right in stable).

Perhaps to not scare the potential users away, as in 'like not that much
more secure to be worth the download'?
Also, the GPA can attach tor/TBB as designed; the FBI's thing relies
on vulnerabilities that are not in the design. But I'm not writing
the download page.
Yes, but the phoning home is necessary to locate the user. It could
just as well access ifconfig.me via clearnet, and then relay the result
home via tor, but that is an unnecessary step.
If it were to just take control of the machine it could really do
all its comm via tor.
Yes. Basically, firefox, and everything it starts needs to be contained
in a sandbox. (With the added difficulty that opening some documents
on some systems will not start a new process but tell an existing one
to open the doc.)
Because windows. I had a proprietary windows service wrapper (that
needs to be compiled into the service's, i.e. tor's, code), and remember
the fickleness; I never looked into how to run tor as a windows service
officially. And partly because I have TBB running all the time anyway.
Also: Admin permissions, and update hassle. Self-updating tor as windows service?
I don't think we even have a suitable download source for that.
(My raspberries all do have tor as a service, in different ways, and
different ages. Because no TBB for them, and because they have the
hidden services to access.)

Fresh install, no config change, except for the above (I still have
the old install.exe).
This is probably the interesting part - the beginning of the browser log

@_subject: [tor-talk] ascertain trustworthyness of entry-nodes and obfs4 
Obviously not. To test that you need to try to connect to it and
consequently risk running into a block.
For the paranoid: The firewall operator might just as well just log who
is using known brigde (incl. obfs4) addresses but letting the connections
pass to just see who is using tor.
It's not as much overlooked but almost impossible to avoid. The only
is/was domain fronting on a cloud provider and might be encrypted SNI once that itself is widely deployed - only then do you look the same
as regular internet users.
On the other hand, the question is whether using tor itself is outlawed or raising suspicion in your country.
By knowing and trusting the operator. That's the reason tor stopped
swapping entry nodes around - the fewer you use the lower the risk.
Also, geographic selection: Depending on the country of the relay,
trolls are unlikely to report to your gvt.

@_subject: [tor-talk] privacy concerns with new CAPTCHA-method for obfs4 
It also probably violates a few RFCs, and they never advertised
this 'feature'.
Or they don't want to ruin their standing with the client who
has the name that is used in the SNI (and who takes the loss
when china should decide to block that b/c it's used by fronters).

SNI: Server Name Indication. While setting up the encryption the client
needs to send (in cleartext) the host name it wishes to connect to
(so that the server can use the corresponding certificate). That is how
https still gives away whom you're talking to.
The name of some service (web site) hosted. Domain fronting means that
the meek client uses one hostname for establishing the encrytion, and
inside the encrypted channel a different hostname it actually wants to
talk to. Google apparently now enforces that these two are the same.
The cleartest hostname in the SNI (if it bothers to). (Question is how
they detect what hostnames are used there.)
Here the SNI host field is already sent encrypted so china can't tell
anymore which service/website on azure/whatever you're connecting to,
it only sees that you are addressing azures/googles/amazons/cloudflares
cloud. But it will take time until this is widely in use so that you're
not suspicious for just using ESNI (not sure if that is an official

@_subject: [tor-talk] alt-svc supported by TBB 
It works some of the time. One point: On first load the page
cannot be green - you need one round to fetch the alt-svc
header before you can actually go and use that.
But then it would be helpful if the site showed how it comes
to the conclusion of a color - it seems I'm getting a lot of
red in spite of obviously using tor. (Looks like it is relying
on cloudflare's judgement via IPCOUNTRY.)
Once yellow after a 'new circuit' the reload gives a green page.
Also bad: Firefox doesn't seem to show whether the alt-svc
was used for a request.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor on the International Space Station? 
The ISS doesn't fly that high - having a link directly down would
means a few millisecond ping time. But they have to link via (other)
satellites because you'd need an awful lot of ground stations to be
able to continuously connect directly to those. And depending on the
relay satellite height that adds quite some delay.
Also the ping times over a day probably look quite interesting.

Or when resizing to anything that is not a multiple of 100px in either
dimension, 200px when over 1600px.
Try with this:  (static page, displays windows.outer
and .inner sizes, obviously requires javascript).
It indeed is on my laptop where I lose more that 10% of screen estate,
and it's not big to begin with.
It's also annoying on the big screen when you work with night mode
pages in fullscreen, and get a big glaring border around that.
(Or youtube, for that matter.)
And in my case, a size of 1800x1800 stands out exactly as much as
1920 x 1857 (maximized firefox) - the anonymity seems to be
basically the same.
I didn't find anything in about:config.
Would be help a lot, even if only in about:config - there are many pages
where I care for location anonymity, but they know me anyway (login).

@_subject: [tor-talk] Ports required for Tor and hidden services 
Technically, all of them. A tor client connects to the OR-Ports of tor
relays, and they can be on any port. Many are on 443 and 9001, though.
But you can configure your node to only use specific ports outgoing,
see FirewallPorts and  FascistFirewall in
So, even only of 443, 9001, and perhaps 80 is workable.
