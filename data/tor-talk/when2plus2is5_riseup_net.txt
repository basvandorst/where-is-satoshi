You beat me to it....
Oh well, I wrote my response so I'll post it anyway.
You could try riseup.net, if you have a good use case.
They are a purpose-based provider, and you have to request an account.
It usually takes a few days for a decision to be made. If you just want
to have an email account with them, they will probably say no. You have
to provide a good reason to want to use their service.
Here's some info about them:
They're great people, and I love their web interface, though I mainly
use TorBirdy to connect to them. Not only can you connect to them
through Tor, you can connect through their onion service. Can't get much
more Tor friendly than that.
They offer a ton of different services. Michael Ball got most of them,
but also vpn, and etherpad. Everything they offer in the clear also has
an onion address.

There are tons of problems with the suggestion, IMMHO.
Good read:
I have very strong reservations about anyone suggesting internet fast
lanes, or pay to play lanes.
I run my relays for everyone, equally. If someone is poor, that doesn't
mean they are any less important. For the purposes of Tor, chances are
poor people match more closely to Tor's project goals. Based entirely on
nothing but a guess, I would expect a poor person to be more willing, or
more inclined to be a whistle blower, or more interested in political
change, or more dedicated to social improvement, over a debutante
dilettante. A very well off white guy in middle America suburbia has
nothing to lose provided the status quo remains. A very poor person has
nothing to gain from the status quo, so would tend to try to improve
themselves, and others.
It would also introduce fascinating attack vectors, as it would be
relatively easy to determine who the "poor" people are vs who the "rich"
people are, based simply on what a particular relay charges for it's
service. The reduced anonymity set would present interesting problems.
Assuming your numbers, at today's rate, 0.001BTC would be $0.23USD/MB
($0.28 for us Canadians).
$0.23/MB at 100GB/day = $23,000/day
$0.23/MB at 3TB(100GB*30)/month = $690,000/month
That's a disturbingly good ROI, considering the cost for the operator
would be anywhere between $3-15/month.
(For a rich person to download a 1GB file, it would cost them $230.)
Finally, attempting to monetize a system that is currently free as in
beer, would not necessarily bring out the best in people. Sure, some
operators would run their relays for free, but many wouldn't. When
certain people realize that they could monetize the relay, what's to
stop them from sniffing the data to make even more money?
BUT, what do I know. Read the blog, it's much better written than my
gibberish regarding this topic.

Hi Felipe,
It's an issue that is relevant to Tor, and in many online communities.
So please don't think it's a bad idea, it's just a very complicated one.
Incentivizing (part of) the system is not necessarily a bad thing.
Something to encourage bigger and better relays is good.
One potential work-around would be to allow up to X% of any given relay
to be used for the express lane, but to always have the rest completely
open. I could envision up to 10% of total throughput to be dedicated to
paying customers, and 90% for everyone else. If every exit relay's
express quota is full, you wouldn't pay. At most I think $10USD/TB would
be acceptable - though I'm not a fan of this anyway.
Personally, I'm a fan of badges and social rewards. I've read quite a
few books and many blogs and studies on the topic. For several varying
reason, people like to collect things, regardless of actual monetary
value - and in fact sometimes directly because of the lack of monetary
value. A reward that must be earned and cannot be purchased. The social
standing badges and awards create is fascinating. I fully appreciate
this may not work given the current community atmosphere, but I mention
it nonetheless because it is interesting.
Regarding forking the system, of course you could! But that leads to so
many other issues...
BT on Tor is bad for at least 2 reasons.
1) BT will do what it what it can to connect to peers, including
bypassing Tor, which could leak information about you, which negates the
reason for downloading off Tor. This isn't Tor's fault.
2) It's just mean! :)
I find the BT/Tor problem to be... BT. This is beyond the scope of this
discussion, however.

Hi Akater,
Traffic overload is still an issue, yes. This causes problems for
everyone. That was my  being mean. Sorry for not clarifying that.
Good read:
It's a few years old, but covers a lot and still relevant.
But the reason for not using BT over Tor is IMHO more than anything a
security/anonymity issue.
Let's look at the reason why someone thinks they would want to use BT
over Tor.
- They believe it will provide them anonymity.
What benefit would Tor be to the user if their BT client of choice
provided their actual IP address to the tracker and to each peer? The
answer is mostly none. (There are certain circumstances where that's not
completely true, for example ISPs that do DPI to throttle torrent traffic.)
Unless your ISP does DPI and throttles you, you will almost certainly
always download slower, for several reasons I won't elucidate. This just
gives interested parties more time to find you. If your ISP does do DPI,
there are better ways around that. Tor is slow.
BT uses UDP and TCP. Tor doesn't do UDP, but it does TCP very well.
There are ways to block the UDP, but most people would never think/know
about that, and many users find that disabling UDP/DHT makes their peer
count drop which makes them re-enable it immediately out of fear their
download may take a little longer.
So, with a BT client that exposes your real IP address to the tracker
and peers, and DHT through UDP being sent over clearnet, any concept of
privacy/anonymity is broken.
Yes, you can disable DHT. You can block UDP connections. You could find
a BT client that doesn't expose your real IP address. But then certain
mis-steps and limitations within Tor also provide attack vectors for
de-anonymizing torrent users.
... The reasons I say this is because I know someone who used Tor to
download torrents, and his ISP kindly let him know that HBO provided
them detailed logs that he downloaded specific episodes of one of their
most popular shows. He thought he was being very smart and protecting
himself, and was dumbfounded when his ISP contacted him.

@_author: Speak Freely 
@_subject: [tor-talk] evidence that Tor isn't "amoral"? 
1) Several people misunderstood a study finding that 80% of onion
service was child pornography and flipped it to being 80% Tor traffic.
It was parroted by government officials, and then became 'truth' by
virtue of people blindly following government fiat. From what I
remember, onion service traffic represents about 1.5% of Tor traffic.
Here is Wired explaining how the Justice Department failed so miserably.
2) What is 'amoral'?
This is a legal and philosophical question. Is it amoral to the
government? To religion? To liberals? To homophobes? Or to you/your
friend/family/acquaintance/some dude on an irc chat?
Yes, Tor is often used for what some would consider amoral. Talking
negatively about your government can get you disappeared. Being
homosexual in Uganda can get you killed. Being a political activist in
your country could get you a bullet in your head, or in Brazil you could
be... Nevermind.
In countless countries around the world governments decide what can and
cannot be done, said, or thought. Tor allows people to be who they
are/want to be, without worrying about everyone and everything.
Watching pornography is most definitely amoral in some countries, but
not in others. Whose morality defines morality?
It's also incredibly difficult to correlate Tor 'amorality' against
clearnet 'amorality'. Amorality is in the eye of the accuser.
My advice: don't listen to your online friend, he doesn't know what he's
talking about. The only way to know exit-relay traffic stats is to pwn
every exit relay and capture all data over a long period of time to
analyze where everyone goes - which is not a realistic possibility. Or
tell your friend to get off their high horse of moral superiority and
realize that someone somewhere thinks what everyone else does is amoral,
and they have the right to think what they do just like everyone else -
just like I have the right to think they are total douche bags.

You will have to download GnuPG.
3) Check the Event Viewer
Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Event Viewer.
Look in each of the folders for errors. A 'good' idea is to try to run

Hi Bill,
There are so many possibilities why the download did not succeed, if we
can confirm that's what happened.
If you have a spotty internet connection (dial-up, satellite, fixed
wireless, rural DSL, etc), or you're using Internet Explorer 6-8, or
just other random problems.
Until you follow all of the instructions, we can't yet truly confirm
that is actually the problem, though.
And adding on to Seth's statement, that's right, most people have never
verified their download. Few people download the signature, fewer check.
However, this is really the only way that I know of that ensures that
the file you downloaded is the complete file the Tor Project meant for
you to get. And when you can verify whether or not the download is
valid, we can move forward.
If anyone else has any ideas, feel free to jump in.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Alternatives to Tor Browser? 
My two cents:
The article is poorly written, and describes "alternatives" very poorly,
or down right incorrectly.
There are alternatives out there, but they missed quite a few good ones.
And they glossed over the fact that the article was about how Tor has
been compromised, while at the very same time suggesting using
alternative software that uses Tor. That's not an alternative.
- Tails uses the Tor network and TBB.
- Subgraph uses Tor.
Now... Subgraph looks interesting. But what's the point? Their time
would have been better spent forking Tails, instead of attempting to
re-invent the wheel from the ground up. Or jump onto the Hurd project
and get that damn thing working.
The Tor community uses well established software (Debian for Tails,
Firefox for Tor Browser, Thunderbird for TorBirdy) and modifies them to
be as secure as possible.
Subgraph claims they wrote their own code from scratch. This is an...
ideological decision... but I would always take open source software
reviewed by thousands of users, possibly tens of thousands over the
years for Debian, over open source software reviewed by possibly dozens
of users.
But more to the point, Subgraph isn't available. Development of Subgraph
mail appears to have stopped August 2014, their last blog post was over
5 months ago, and there exists nothing for Subgraph OS to download/review.
All that being said, it is possible these guys from Montreal are
fantastic developers with mad 1337 skills that can revolutionize the
internet. Time will tell.
Again - my two cents.

"Tor" didn't issue anything, but there is a slight possibility the
problems may be related to "Tor" Browser's security settings.
There are several problems with the site, which have nothing to do with
- The 406 error could be caused by a MIME issue. The document has the
MIME type listed, but the server may be sending something else in the
- The 406 error could also be a firewall exception in Apache from
- The 404 error was most likely a programming mistake, or the
favicon.ico missing - it appears to come from an unhandled exception in
the ErrorDocument.
- Cookies come from freeserv.dukascopy.com, instead of stox-office.com,
which could/should lead to permission issues
- The SSL certificate points to a different domain name
(freeserv.dukascopy.com) than the one listed (stox-office.com).
So I doubt "Tor" is the problem. "Tor" Browser has a lot of security
enhancements and modifications to help anonymity and privacy, but
sometimes these enhancements and modifications make bad websites break
I'm not going to dig deeper into this, but chances are the best bet is
to visit a better site. Sorry I don't have anything better to offer.

I'm thinking...
Making direct connections per user/device to Tor would help.
Assuming many devices and x number of 'usual guests' would mean much
cover traffic. Spreading the cover goodness over many different relays
is optimal, no?
Unless all of your devices and users are malevolent, more is better. If
they are all malevolent, well you've got other issues at hand, but I
suspect in that case a single connection would be better - to reduce
your overall footprint. (But again, depending on the level of
malevolence, there are always attack vectors to exploit.)
My rationale is purely based on the theory of a larger anonymity set
being better for Tor as a whole, and not on the technicalities of your
user's actions, nor necessarily on the level of protection for your
individual users/devices.
I have been known to be wrong, so if anyone wishes to disagree with me,
please do.
