@_subject: Torbutton : please offer better user agent choices 
Hash: SHA256
twinkletoedturtle at Safe-mail.net a ?crit :
the past with no reasonable answer given via Torbutton's author, I
appeal to Torbutton's author:
in Torbutton is not updated often enough and we should have the choice
of defining our own user agent or choosing between more than one which
lacks freshness in updates. I've read your reasons for why this stagnant
user agent is used and I'm not happy with it.
allow for better control over our user agent? We should not have to
install yet another add on for Firefox to obtain this feature. Surely
there's some open code available which could be added quickly to allow
this functionality to Torbutton? We've heard your reason for the user
agent you provide for Torbutton, but many of us aren't satisfied and
urge you to kindly improve user agent functionality in Torbutton. One
user agent string, especially one which receives too few updates, is not
enough for many of us. This is not about one person's idea of "blending
into other Tor users", fine, let's blend with other tor users, but offer
us more of a choice beyond this limited and stagnant type of blending.
after the author has submitted them without the author's approval, thank
you for moving to gpg sign releases. Thank you for Torbutton.

When you know that Pidgin is storing passwords as cleartext, your first
reflex must be to store Tor-bundle on an encrypted storage device.
Logging history is secondary compared to clear passwords.

Some facts described in these articles are strange:
1) There aren't so many nodes, i count only ~2400 of them. (9000 in the
2) They say 50% of them are on Windows, while a rapid check here
 indicates
only ~22% of them are
3) It's not a vulnerability of Tor that is exploited to escalate rights,
it's a windows'
4) Packet spinning attack is an old one, already described here :
5) I've always wondered why the OSes running the node were public. Is it
really necessary to make the Tor network running?
