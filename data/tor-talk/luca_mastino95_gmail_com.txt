Hey there guys,
I'm trying to find out a way to install on my Tor broswer some Firefox
Plugins (Addons).
I don't really care about being 100% anonymous - I just need to browse the
web with another IP address and being able to use addons. :)
Is there a way to solve my problem?

The main problem is that I'm looking for proxies from less populed
countries (As Cambodia, Mongolia, Maldives and so on...) and it's not that
easy find a working proxy in the web.
Anyway, can you suggest me a way to use hop proxies? (I suppose that you
mean changing my browser settings, right?)
I tried to set a proxy but it's not working, since programs like Geotool
tell me I'm in Sardinia - as usual.
