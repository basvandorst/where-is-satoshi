@_subject: [tor-talk] Amazon Cloud Bridges 
I just set up an Amazon cloud bridge for Tor.? I have a simple question.? Now that the EC2 Instance is set up and active, do I have to press the Launch Instance button at the top of the page on my Amazon EC2 Dashboard?? Do I have to do anything at all?? Under "Status Check", it says "2/2 checks passed.? So does that mean it's live and what not?
Is there a way for me to tell if it is being used?? I figure if it's being used, it must be active.? I realize it will not get used instantly, but I want to make sure it is usable by the general public.
