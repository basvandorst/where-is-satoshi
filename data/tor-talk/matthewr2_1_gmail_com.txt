@_subject: New Hidden Wiki 
I just put up a new hidden wiki.  It's at With a little googling, I found a page that had the main page of the
old hidden wiki, so I put it up as the main page of the new hidden
It still needs some updating to the hidden services, conversion of the
rest of the camelcase links to mediawiki links, re-creation of the
other pages, and anything else I haven't thought of.

You can only go so far in attempting to blend all the users together
into one indistinguishable group, so the Tor Browser Bundle's job is
to give it the best possible shot.  It can't possibly do everything,
catch all cases, or correct your unique fingerprint of spelling
mistakes.  However, it still gives you the best possible shot of any
other available method, period,  even if you are the God of Browser
Configuration.  It has nothing to do with skillset and everything to
do with reliably making everyone statistically too close in
configuration to make unique identification reliable.
Doing anything but using the stock Tor Browser Bundle works against
you, but in a very subtle, non-obvious, Chinese finger-trap sort of
way:  You aren't using TBB like everyone else is, so you are uniquely
identifiable across web sites and exit nodes because you are doing
something (anything!) else, regardless of specifically *what* it is
you are using.  The more you change things further, the more unique
you make yourself, unless you make everyone *else* do exactly what you
are doing, too.
If TBB does indeed send your real screen resolution (that may have
been accounted for, I don't know), you may be part of a group of
57.68% (or whatever the real figure is) of users running TBB at, say,
1280x1024, but that group is still a heck of a lot larger than one
user out of all users doing something entirely different altogether,
so TBB is still the smarter choice of the two.
