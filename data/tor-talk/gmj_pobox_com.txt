@_subject: tor client over HTTP or SSH port forwarding ? 
I caught the talk @ USENIX.  Excellent !.
The question I had (which I thought would be a FAQ) is how do set uo
a tor client behind a firewall that does not allow ports :90?? out ?
Thoughts were some sort of everything-goes-over-HTTP proxy or
some sort of SSH port forwarding/routing wierdnesses.  Suggestions ?
FAQ pointers ?

  was a side effect of copyright enforcement.

============================== START ==============================
OK.  I signed up to -announce.
I think it does funky things so that all connections (http,https,ftp)
go to 80.
to your torrc file, and Tor will only
OK.  Sounds like ssh port forwarding to a less restrictive source may be the answer.
