@_subject: Index of hidden services? 
On the website describing how to set up a hidden service
I saw a mention of a (hypothetical?) "Hidden Services Wiki"
where pointers to hidden services are stored.  Does such a wiki exist?
If so, where can I find it?
If not, what do people think about setting up such an index?
It seems like it might be very useful for those operators of
hidden services that want to expose them to a wider audience
than just the people they give the .onion name to.  Being able
to browse or search the hidden services might also be useful.
There are likely some issues that need to be addressed, such
as what are the procedures for adding/removing entries from the
list and whether there would be any curation or censorship of
individual sites on the list.  A widely publicized .onion name
might also be subject to unwanted traffic of several varieties
that would need to be dealt with.
Any thoughts?
