Hash: SHA1
 > Has anybody else experienced this?
Yes, now that I've read this, I just noticed that my server never
recovered from the router bump (and the resulting change of my
dynamic IP address) I initiated last night: the last log messages
from last night are the "Excellent; ports reachable" messages.
I'm running 0.1.1.20 on Windows XP, using dyndns.org to point to a
dynamic IP address, and I'm almost positive this problem is new to
this version.
