Same here - just once in the past 24 hours. It was a real POP3 server
that was being connected to.

if my server starts to hibernate will it still serve directory requests?

@_subject: AccountingMax and directory serving 
I've had a look at the FAQ and can't find the answer to this. Does
AccountingMax take into account directory serving? I'm guessing the
answer is yes, because I have set AccountingMax to 3500 MB and my server
hibernated after about this much outbound traffic, even though inbound
was less than 2GB. I'm assuming the difference between in and out is
largely directory requests.

Thanks - are the latest alphas stable enough for everyday use as a
server? Can 0.1.1.x be installed straight over an existing 0.1.0.17

chkconfig --add tor
would have achieved the same thing. I don't know why it doesn't do this
by default - the 0.1.1.14 RPM doesn't do it, either.

I upgraded to 0.1.1.14-alpha earlier today and have just noticed this in
the logs:
Feb 22 21:59:13.588 [notice] cull_wedged_cpuworkers(): Bug: closing
wedged cpuworker. Can somebody find the bug?
Feb 22 21:59:13.609 [err] cpuworker_main(): writing response buf failed.
Does Tor need restarting after this? It still appeared to be passing
Incidentally I have a hyperthreading processor so have set NumCPUs to 2

@_subject: Reduced throughput with 0.1.1.14 
Ever since I upgraded from 0.1.0.17 to 0.1.1.14 yesterday afternoon, throughput has dropped noticably. Also, I don't appear to be serving directory information any longer. See the MRTG snapshot at
You can see where I installed 0.1.1.14 around 16:00 yesterday. This is node flutic, by the way.
BandwidthRate is set to 70 KB, BandwidthBurst to 140 KB.

@_subject: 0.1.0.17 questions 
The problem is that the upgrade takes it out of the run levels and
doesn't put it back, so if you upgrade you have to remember to
"/sbin/chkconfig --add tor" manually.
At least this is what has happened on mine when going from 0.1.0.16 to
0.1.0.17 and then to 0.1.1.14.

@_subject: I've disappeared from the directory! 
My node, flutic, seems to have gone from the directory. Tor is still
running and works as an entry node. No error messages in the logs
(although this is set to "notice").
I'm running 0.1.1.14-alpha.

Yes, it's back now. But I noticed from MRTG that traffic started to
reduce at 12:00 GMT - by 14:30 there was barely anything going through
so I looked at
and flutic was missing. At that point, the last published descriptor was
dated 2006-03-07 10:24:33.
