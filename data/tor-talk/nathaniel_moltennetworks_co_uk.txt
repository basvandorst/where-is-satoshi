@_subject: [tor-talk] ISP CenturyLink Blocking Tor? 
I have been at a close friend's house recently and his provider is  CenturyLink (at home I use TimeWarner Cable). I tried to download Tor  Tails (over BitTorrent) and the Internet literally dropped so I closed  BitTorrrent, afterwards I launched the Tor Browser Bundle and then my  computer was disconnected from the router and couldn't reconnect and  no one at the house could access the Internet, we had to reboot the  router to fix the issue. I then enabled Pluggable Transports  (meet-google or something like that) and now I'm able to connect to  Tor without any issues. This really concerns me as I was able to  repeat the crash by launching Tor Browser Bundle and crash the router  This worries me as I can see a direct link (Launch Tor Browsre Bundle  without Pluggable Transports) and (Router and Internet require  Reboot). Could this be a form of censorship within the United States?
I will be returning home today but this is really worrying me as it  could be a form of censorship within the United States.
Does anyone have any ideas or thoughts about this?

I waited and switched my laptop back to Debian Linux from Windows 8.1  and build my WiFi Driver from source. (it was a Microsoft Driver for  the Edimax Nano Wifi) (the source was from edimax) and afterwards I  was able to connect to Tor without crashing the entire WiFi Network. I  wonder if Microsoft's Driver was tapped or something. I agree the US  is not as safe as it used to be.
