The configuration that Torbutton sets is perfectly fine.
"Newer Firefoxes have the ability to send DNS resolves through the socks
proxy, and Torbutton will make use of this feature if it is available in
your version of Firefox."
The tor configuration help page doesn't take this into account. I would
imagine that 1.5.0.6 is new enough to have this feature, but you may
want to update to 1.5.0.7 to be on the safe side (a good idea anyway).

I'm very pleased with the new Torbutton version so far. The only thing
that's bothering me is automatically disabling 'Remember passwords for
sites' when tor is toggled on. I'd prefer a way to disable this feature.
Even if logging into sites over tor can be dangerous for anonymity and
the security of the account itself, it's still nice to prevent one's ISP
from retaining a record of goings on. It's possible to manually
re-enable remembering passwords after tor has been toggled on, so it's a
minor inconvenience, really.
Thanks for the great tool.

I missed the fact that the login history was tied to the history write
setting because when I was poking around trying to make it work how I
wanted, I simply unchecked the box and looked to see if the login
history had turned back on without actually toggling tor again. Having
it tied to the history seems logical to me, so I'm actually fine with
that the way it is. A nice, multi-line tooltip would probably have
eliminated my problem altogether :). Maybe some of the more obscure and
specialized caveats that folks are having such wanting to control the
cache manually could be addressed in about:config options without
actually appearing as a nob in the options panel, that way one could
change it if they *really* want to. I'm not sure how you could make a
stern warning (ie: crucial) if the option could put them in serious
jeopardy that way, though.

Also note that browsing with Firefox using the NoScript
 extension renders this attack and most others
useless, since that java applet never gets executed.

There's still the possibility that a server op is using their Tor node
as a scapegoat and really is doing bad things (I don't mean to imply
that's the case here). Even if the police know that their suspect is
running a Tor node, what Tor is, and what it's used for, they're still
going to investigate him. All we can hope for is that they'd be a bit
nicer about it.
