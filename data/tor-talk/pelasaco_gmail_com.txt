@_subject: [tor-talk] Bill of rights in Brazil 
I would like to know your opinion about it
In one hand I find it is good to do awareness without any kind of violence
(physical or monetary) but in another hand, any kind of regulation can be,
in the near future, changed to empower the government to do something that
unfortunately is quite usual in the
south-american-left-populist-governments: Midia Control and censorship
