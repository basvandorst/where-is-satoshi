Hi Kyle,
What about the RB433 or RB433AH which are 300MHz / 64MB / $100 and
680MHz / 128MB / $??? boards?  (See I know the extra ports are overkill, but they might handle a better load.
Isn't memory also an issue?  My problem running a tor client on the
Linksys wrt54g was memory ( BCM4710 / 16MB ).

@_subject: iptables and tor 
Hi everyone,
Has anyone given any thought as to what firewall rules to use on a linux
system running a tor server?  Besides the usual attacks against the
system itself, I'm particularly concerned with possible attacks against
the tor network itslef which could be circumvented by proper firewall
rules --- something like using the TCP options to "mark" tor packets so
they can be tracked or similar hacks.  I haven't investigated deeply, so
my concerns may be misplaced --- perhaps the packets are sufficiently
scrubbed when they are relayed by the routers's ssl connections and no
further scrubbing by iptables is needed to enhance anonymity.
Can anyone comment?

Thanks Csaba, that's exactly what I was worried about and your
information is reassuring.   The usual allow/deny rules should be good

@_subject: Tor-Ramdisk 
Hi everyone,
A month ago I developed a small, ramdisk only (ie diskless), linux
system whose only purpose was to run a tor server.  The aim of the
project was to meet the following goals:
    1) small footprint - i686 (single or SMP) with 256MB+ RAM
    2) to run only in ram so nothing survives a reboot
    3) to do no logging whatsoever at any level
    4) to be secure - GRSEC hardened kernel
    5) to run a tor server, allowing for any configuration,
middle/exit/directory, etc
I suspect such a project might be of interest to other Tor operators.
I ran a middle-man node for about 20 days with success
(node-name=RamOnly), but because I compiled statically against GLIBC, I
broke DNS resolution, and so it would not work as an exit node.  I've
rebuild the image from scratch compiling against UCLIBC and I'm now in
the testing phase again.  I'm running another middle-man/directory
server (node-name=RamOnlyUCLIBC).  Here's the url for the howto and the
    ftp://ddl.dyc.edu/pub/tor-uclibc-ramdisk
The kernel is compiled with support for most 100MB and 1GB NIC cards. Any comments or testers would be much appreciated.
More details:
    busybox-1.8.2 - minimally configured, compiled with UCLIBC
    linux-2.6.23.12 patched with Gentoo's hardening patches (GRSEC)
    tor-1.2.19

Hi Algenon,
I'm sorry, that was the wrong site!  (For internal college use only).  Try
   ftp://cheshire.dyc.edu/pub/tor-uclibc-ramdisk
of if ftp is a problem
    Thanks for alerting me!
At 3.8 MB for the image, imagine every cell phone in the future being a
tor server.

@_subject: SSL Keys + Identity of a Tor server 
Hi everyone,
If I wanted to preserve the identity of a Tor server, I know I need to
keep the ssl keys.  I believe the only files I need to keep are
secret_id_key and secret_onion_key in /var/lib/tor/keys directory.  Am I

@_subject: SSL Keys + Identity of a Tor server 
Thanks Andrew, two more questions not covered in the FAQ --- I want to
be sure before I do anything I'll regret later.
1) Do I need the secret_onion_key also?  It appears to be regenerated
occasionally so I assuming it doesn't matter for the identity of the
node.  I'm not sure what its function is which is what lead me to the
original post.
2) Is preserving the Nickname and the secret_id_key sufficient, as per
the FAQ?  In particular, if the IP address changes, does it matter?
I should say there are three reasons I'm asking:
1) I'm thinking of moving my tor relay server to another IP address.
2) This server was an ubuntu box and was affected by the debian openssl
flaw.  It used to be flagged as "Named" in the listing, but ever since I
regenerated the keys, it has remained unamed.
3) I'm working on a (new) release of a ramdisk-only tor server (I posted
about it before), but this time, I want to make sure that on reboots, it
preserve all the necessary files to maintain the node's ID.

@_subject: Is tor-resolve required to run an Exit node. 
I'm reading the tor code and (if I've understood it) it looks like the
"tor" binary is sufficient for running either a relay or exit node. i.e. tor-resolve is simply an "extra" utility for the end user to do DNS
resolution via tor rather than via one's DNS server as defined in
Can someone confirm this?  Am asking because I want to be certain about
what binaries to include in this ramdisk image I'm buidling.

@_subject: a serious TOR adversary? 
This appears to be a variation on the work by Bauer et al. at U.
Colorado at Boulder in which they exploit the tension between anonymity and
low latency.  Basically, an adversary that is able to watch traffic on a
certain percentage of entrance and exit nodes can correlated connections
in and out of the tor-cloud (based on the timing) and deduce the source,
thus compromising anonymity.  It reminds us that " This is experimental
software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity."
