I'm wondering if any brave soul on the Internet has setup a public HTTP gateway to hidden HTTP services.
I mean, plain web browsers surfing the plain old Internet and connecting to an URL like:
where a server is actually proxying requests to that URL to the Tor network's hidden service:
It would be rather simple to setup such a service using Apache's Rewrite engine but maybe it would expose the administrator to excessive risks...
Thank you,

If I understand your point correctly, you're talking about security through obscurity.
I mean, anyone can have a look to the Tor network's contents if she setups her client to access it. So there's no difference between access through a Tor client or a plain HTTP gateway from a contents point-of-you.
The point here is the liability of the HTTP gateway's administrator when delivering unacceptable contents to plain HTTP clients, which seems to me no different from the liability risk undertaken by exit nodes' administrators when accessing an HTTP server outside the Tor network.

Any plan to support DNS queries other than "A" (i.e. MX, NS and so on)
in tor-resolve? This will allow to run, for example, a
transparently-anonymized SMTP server (a-la transocks).
Mmmmhhh... Mind you, I'm not an email spammer... :) Just wondering...
