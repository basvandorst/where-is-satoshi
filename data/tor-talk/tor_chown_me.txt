?Nos oignons? is a french not-for-profit project started last summer to
collect donations in order to run Tor exit nodes, like torservers.net.
We are happy to announce that we are now accepting donations! Thanks to
FDN? (who started to collect donations for WikiLeaks a few months ago)
credit cards and wire transfers are accepted. For details, please visit
our brand new website:
    We have spent most of our energies so far in setting up the
organization. From now on, we will be able to focus on what gathered us:
running Tor exit nodes. The first one should be up before summer.
Thanks for your support!

FTR, I didn't reply to your previous mail because I didn't think it was
the right place to talk. Sorry for the noise.
Currently in the port for 5.6 there is 0.2.4.26 which is the old stable.
In three weeks, 5.7 will be out which ship 0.2.5.x.
So yes you can, build it from source, though that's not what I would
advise to someone who can't install a package.
wtf ...
I wouldn't be as confident as you are. How many times is it written in
the FAQ to not to mix things?
mix things like OpenBSD, which has its own libressl in the source tree,
with libressl -portable? Because I guess it's why there's this FTP
repository, right?
Just for the fun, do you recommend using openssh -portable to have
openssh 6.8 on OpenBSD 5.6?
Do you mean that the libressl present in the OpenBSD 5.6 source tree
has bugs and vulns?
That's a so much better idea to not to check where's the code is
coming, yeah!
Maybe because something like a patch has been removed?
You don't even understand what you're doing nor you're being careful.
Sorry, I really don't know the solution when some can't sudo pkg_add
tor, or when there's a port to rebuild just cd /usr/port/net/tor &&
sudo make update?
(yes you need a port tree which can be fetched by copy/paste
I don't understand what is the difficulty, otherwise I'd try to
simplify things :(
And maybe they'll break their system. Hopefully no.
Daniel

Why are you doing this?
Just `pkg_add tor` or if you want to compile it by yourself, just go
in /usr/ports/net/tor (if you don't have it yet, see [1]) and then run
`make install`.
And read OpenBSD's FAQ if you have any difficulties :)

Yeah, why using a port/package when you can do everything manually?
Have fun OP.

Yup, a library got bumped. I rebuilt it for my own need but I can share
it:

I hope 6.5.1 will make it to -stable. Hopefully next updates will be
backported as well.
