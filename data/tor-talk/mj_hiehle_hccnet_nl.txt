@_subject: [tor-talk] Firefox-update in Tor Browser Bundle? 
Hello to all,
Since a few days I use the Tor Browser Bundle and I like it. (Some time ago I had the Tor proxy installed in Firefox; that did not work, so I am glad to have the bundle ).
Now Firefox comes with the announcement / advice to download and install with an upgrade to version 4.
  Is it possible to upgrade? What to do in this case?
