Paranoid mode: on
They intercept the initial bootstrapping and make you connect
to a "fake" tor network composed of malicious nodes only.
Is it feasible?

@_subject: [tor-talk] blocked exit node IP because of spam 
I think one possible solution would be something like this:
1) drop unless encrypted
2) even if encrypted drop unless either:
a) known person
b) email is of the form
where content is the actual email and work is a proof of work: example: x
such that sha256(x+hash(content)+timestamp) starts with n zeroes.
Ideally make n such that generating x takes a couple of seconds

@_subject: [tor-talk] Creating distributed social networks with WebId 
2012/6/2 Randolph D. :
Actually, interface is just a layer above retroshare,
and "add a proxy into the lib of rslib" is not
an easy thing to do, as the TBB has proven.
Developing a secure social network is not only
a matter of decentralization (hello Diaspora!),
it's a matter of creating a whole safe architecture.
And no, tor is no fairy dust, so simply encapsulating
a social network over tor is quite useless.

Quick feedback:
1) nice idea
2) tor hidden services already have transport level encryption
3) there are plenty of https hosts providers, but no .onion ones
4) this requires every user to have an always on machine

2012/5/24 Sebastian G.  :
The problem is not the exit policy.
Identd is a service that should be listening on the user computer.
This is obviously not possible with tor.

I would like to set up tor on a server I'm preparing, and would like to ask
for help, as my threat model is somehow different from the standard one.
I'm going to have a lot of users using tor on the machine, and my main
concern is one user interfering with another user privacy.
As it's a shared server, even if someone can find out the source ip that's
not a big deal, but what I want to protect from are attackers finding out
the username behind a tor connection.
Are the default settings ok?
Any suggestion?
