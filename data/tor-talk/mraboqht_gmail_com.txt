An attempt was made to subscribe your address to the mailing list
tor-talk at lists.torproject.org.  You are already subscribed to this mailing
Note that the list membership is not public, so it is possible that a bad
person was trying to probe the list for its membership.  This would be a
privacy violation if we let them do this, but we didn't.
If you submitted the subscription request and forgot that you were already
subscribed to the list, then you can ignore this message.  If you suspect
an attempt is being made to covertly discover whether you are a member of
list, and you are worried about your privacy, then feel free to send a
to the list administrator at tor-talk-owner at lists.torproject.org.
