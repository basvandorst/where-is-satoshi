Hello is it possible that Globe and Atlas are not working?
I tried two different Browsers on two different computers.
Atlas for example says: Backend error.
Globe does nothing. Just display the loading circle
Ubuntu 14.10 x64 with latest Chromium and Firefox. No Addons.
Does anybody else have problemes?

Why does Tor have to setup an official CA and passing some audits? Are
they even public?
And why should Tor even rely on that broken CA system? In my opinion a
self signed certificate is the best way at the moment to ship.
The tor developers should invest some time in the CA topic after Tor
becomes a well-known and accpeted network.

I totally agree with you.
While the Tor network already provides crypto, an on-top encryption wouldn't be bad.
If one security layer has holes there would be an additional layer/fallback.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What relay does really help the TOR project? 
Hello List,
I first heard from TOR after the leaks of snowden and started to read a
lot about TOR but never used it - and I still don't use it (I just don't
have the need for it).
Before christmas I started a tor relay on my dedicated server. To be
clear: Just a normal middle relay with 100 MBit/s advertised and 200
MBit/s burst. While the holidays more and more traffic was going over
the network card.
After a week I decided to increase the speed to 200 MBit/s advertised
A day later I took the reduced exit rules and kicked out some more
ports. So now I'm running an exit relay.
The past days I made some short tcpdump traces to find out what people
use TOR for. Well, it's kind of sad. A short analyse of the hostnames
gave me the result: 80% Porn, 10% site crawling, 5% Wordpress comment
spam and 5% "human" traffic.
I don't get why people use TOR for watching porn.
Now I dived deeper into the TOR architecture. I read that now that I'm
running an exit relay I'm not able to be a normal middle relay (please
tell me if I'm wrong).
Since I'm not willing to help people with my exit relay just to watch
anonymous porn on the web, I would rather help the people inside the
network stay anonymous and speedup the network itself - thus just
running a normal relay. I'm aware that the porn traffic will still be
running through the relay but also the "better"/wanted relay-to-relay
Long story short: What type of relay helps the TOR project more?
Exit-Relay or Middle-relay? Is it really the "job" from TOR to provide
an exit to the normal internet ressources or should the focus be on
hidden services?
Thanks in advance for your comments/suggestions,
P.S.: I'm posting this to the normal tor-talk Mailinglist because I want
to catch the opinion from the community and don't have a probleme with
the relay software itself.

apart from that I'm also running a bridge on a different IP. The point

Hello Roger,
I also made some thoughts about making this test as effective as possible.
I thought about HUPing the TOR process every 20 minutes. Do you think
this will help?

Hello I've currently 10 processes which requests the hidden service via the
same TOR daemon. The TOR daemon receives every hour a HUP signal.
As fas as I understand my current setup doesn't help very much because
the circuits are always reused and only built new every hour after the
HUP signal. Am I correct?

Hi Dan,
yesterday I experienced the same issue with slow downloads of the
descriptors but with Telekom as ISP. After the descriptor download
everything was fine.
Today everything is working fine. Do you still have a probleme? If not I
think there was just a temporary network problem.
Well, Great Britrain for example. This country isn't a third world
country and people have the ability to vote and speak freely. If the
people don't raise their voices and refuse to vote someone they like
more because "that will change nothing" they have to pay for their
decision. Of course this isn't something restricted to Great Britain but
also for Germany, France, etc.

Hello Juan,
I can't understand why you subscribe to a list of "scammers" then. You
escalated very quickly and showed a rude attitude most people can't
stand and normally silently ignore and laugh about. And I think that's
why nobody answered your mails.
But I'm interested in you opinion why you think Tor is "scam" to you.
For me Tor itself is really helpfull to escape censorship. And because
it's free and easy to use script kiddies use the network to brute force
WordPress logins and other nasty stuff. Of course that's stupid but
something like that can easily be fixed by setting up proper security
And then there are cases like encrypting you computer and force you to
pay bitcoins to a hidden service etc. But just because they use Tor for
that doesn't mean that the whole network ist just for scam and malicious
If you are able to discuss on a polite level we can also discuss about
your opinion.

this is a basic problem of PKI - is the key the correct one to use.
There is nothing to stop you from copying for example my key
information. That's why you need to check the received key over another
channel. For example I put my fingerprint on my website and it's also on
my business card.
A second way is looking at the signatures from other users thus it's not
the best method for validating an identity.

creating a 1:1 copy of an onion key is very hard. You need much luck or
computing power to generate a key with the exact same hash as the key
you want to copy.
With modern computers and graphic cards it's very easy to find a key
with the same 4 digits but a whole 1:1 copy seems to be impossible at
the moment.
The README describes the problem a bit:
