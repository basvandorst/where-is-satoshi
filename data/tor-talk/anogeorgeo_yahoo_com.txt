Hi eric,
 Open a socket connection to the Tor process's control port and send the desired plaintext commands. You can't natively open sockets with a windows batch files, but you can with Monad (renamed to PowerShell), the new command shell and scripting from Microsoft. Although it's marketed for Windows Vista, it works with any NT-based OS (e.g., XP, NT, Server 2003, etc) and is a free download. WIth PowerShell, you have native access to any .NET and/or COM object--including socket wrapper objects.
Thanks for the info!  I am reading up on PowerShell now and hope to figure it out tonight.
Thanks for the help, Anogerogeo :-)

Hi Arrakistor,
 Unfortunately,  powershell is not any sort of standalone, and requires
the  entire  .net  framework  be  installed to use it, from what I can

Yes, PowerShell requires .Net 2.0 so unfortunitly it is not usefull to your TorPark.  But, as eric mentioned XPCOM may work for you?  Groups are talking. We´re listening. Check out the handy changes to Yahoo! Groups.

@_subject: My ExcludeNodes list...post yours 
Due to recent discussions about an ExcludeNodes list I
thought I would post mine.  Roger (or Nick?) mentioned
they do not use an ExcludeNodes list because it can
mess with Tor's load balancing but I hope this isn't
the case with my list as it only has 11 nodes.
Please post any issues you may have with this list or
any problems you find.  If Tor devs. strongly advise
against this list please let me know.
This list blocks all nodes from China and Hong Kong
along with the traffic sniffing/public posting node
"TORxUNIXGUxRU" (aka "tor.unixgu.ru")- Thanks Freeman
Most recently I included "TORxUNIXGUxRU" because they
are sniffing exit traffic and posting it! :-o Node NickNames for the list below:
"Andrewgao"(CN), "banxian"(CN), "fgsinternet"(CN),
"flyingboy"(CN), "lebut"(CN), "MEMPHIS"(CN),
"distro"(CN), "AABS"(HK), "linoD4sup0Oeixwa1"(HK),
"yt1n1rt"(HK), "TORxUNIXGUxRU"(DE)
The node "homedoyourbest" from China is listed it
isn't a running node.
(This list should of course be one line...)

Hi eric,
 >I know some people are averse to installing .NET and, if that's the case with Anothony, then I doubt there's a viable (free) scripting solution.
I take this back. I forgot you can invoke COM objects from Windows Script Host (WSH) scripts. WSH only requires wscript.exe, not .NET (it predates .NET by a number of years). There are countless COM objects that handle socket communications.
Let me know if you need more info.
Any extra info you feel like posting would be *extremely* helpfull as I am not a programmer.  I have been reading up on PowerShell but I'm a bit more confortable with traditional WSH.
I would prefer to use WSH as .Net is not required and WSH seems a bit easier than PowerShell.
I am most comfortable/knowledgeable with batch scripts (eg. .cmd's) but I'm willing to study and do what it takes to to learn WSH or PowerShell to achive my goal.  I will use which ever you deem the most appropriate and efficient.
I really appreciate all the help/guidence you've given me so far but I don't want to become a pest.
I intend to post the script here (if Nick and Roger don't mind) as I am sure most users of Tor and Win32 NT would love to have access to the final script.
Thank you very much for your time, Anogeorgeo :-)

@_subject: Exit Node sniffing solution...an idea... 
I have been thinking about the issue of exit node
operators and/or adversaries sniffing clear-text
ingress/egress traffic locally and/or remotly on an
exit node.  I have a possible solution but I would
like the Tor devs. and experts here to weigh-in. If this won't work feel free to ignore this
thread...or just belittle me ;-)
--> The Problem:
1. Clear-text traffic can be sniffed by the exit node
operator and/or an adversary remotely and/or locally.
2. There is no current "web of trust" in terms of exit
node operators; anyone can run a exit node.
3. Many services on the 'net (HTTP, POP, etc) do not
offer encrpyted access (HTTPS, POP3s, etc).  This
prevents end-to-end encrypted traffic in may
--> Possible Solution:
4. A couple dozen _fast_ 24x7 exit nodes are run by
trusted operators (read: known personally by Nick or
Roger) on a local machine the operators control.
5. These trusted exit nodes would be setup as Hidden
Services (ex. "
6. Tor would be updated to use these .EXIT.onion nodes
randomly as it now randomly chooses regular exit
7. All Tor traffic exits from these .EXIT.onion nodes.
--> Possible benifits of .EXIT.onion nodes:
8. These .EXIT.onion nodes are run by trusted
operators who can be resonably trusted not to sniff
9. The location of the .EXIT.onion nodes are unknown
to an adversary so in theroy they can not remotely
sniff traffic. (is this correct?)
9a. If an adverary _can_ remotely sniff traffic from
these .EXIT.onion nodes this marginally better than
the current state of affairs where both exit node
operators and adversaries can/do sniff traffic. 10. The operators of these .EXIT.onion nodes can be
kept on a 'closed' list available to Roger, Nick, etc.
10a. This 'closed' list won't contain IP's only
.EXIT.onion address associated with the operators.  10b. Not associating IP's with .EXIT.onion operators
on the 'closed' list should offer an extra layer of
anonymity for the operators.
10c. Due to the fact an .EXIT.onion node operator can
not be associated to any perticular .EXIT.onion node
there may be less liability for the operator.
11. ISP's, websites, etc may not be able to block
these servers as the IP's of the .EXIT.onion nodes are
not associated to the nodes. (is this correct?).
11a. If an ISP, website, etc tries to block an
.EXIT.onion node the operator can simpally change the
.EXIT.onion node URL.
12. A Hidden Service circuit uses 4 hops not 3.  This
extra node may not help with timing attacks but it may
offer extra security/anonymity in other regards. (is
this correct?)
--> Possible problems with .EXIT.onion nodes:
13. Increased latency inherant in Hidden Services may
deter end-users from using Tor.
14. Increased load/latency to the Tor network due to
the 4 node circuit and latency of Hidden Services.
--> Other conciderations:
15. These trusted .EXIT.onion node operators are
probably already running exit nodes.  It may be trival
for them to move there exit nodes behind Hidden
16. All current exit nodes would have to go 'off-line'
at the same time (depreceate via. DirSevers over a few
days?).  16a. This would prevent an observant adverary from
corralating that a few dozen exit nodes dissapered and
a day later the same number of nodes appeared as
.EXIT.onion nodes.  Well, thats all I have.  I'm sure I missed something
or I am misunderstanding some basic premise of Onion
Routing II but I'm open to suggestions and

Here is the post about this Eepsite: Please note I'm not endorsing this Eepsite or the chaining of Tor at all.  I havn't used this and I don't plan to as I think it is unnecessary and can reduce anonymity (like Jap > Tor > Interent).  Besides the fact browsing must slow to a crawl.
Another issue is that the Eepsite seems to be using Privoxy as MITM.  I would however suggest this to filter data from I2P:

Hi clowndevil,
Your .vbs works very well, thanks alot. I took the liberty of modifying your .vbs to use the
SHUTDOWN and NEWNYM pesudo-signals.
I am going to write a Wiki entry for installing
Toolsack and using these verions of your .vbs: HUP,
SHUTDOWN and NEWNYM.
Toolsack runs on all versions of Win32 from 98 to XP
so this should prove very usefull to many, many
Windows users.
The only downside I see to your method is the
requirment of Toolsack.  Do you have any idea how
portable Toolsack is?  On second thought, I could just put Toolsack onto a
USB and create a .reg file of it's registry entries
(via. RegShot) to be executed on the local computer
(Win32 OS of course).  This way I could have Tor,
Vidalia, Toolsack and your .vbs on my USB for complete
portablity ;-)...
The two .vbs files I modified (SHUTDOWN and NEWNYM)
are at the bottom of this email.

@_subject: dns-proxy-tor / freecap 
Hi Steven,
Are you reffering soley to HTTP/S traffic?
If so, your DNS quaries are not leaked if you have
your browser and Privoxy configured correctly.  That
is, if your browser is setup to route into Privoxy
(which uses Socks4a) and Privoxy's "config.txt" has
this line at the top:
forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .
If you are reffering to non-HTTP/S traffic then most
likly your DNS quaries *are* being leaked.  In which
case you need to use an app that routes your DNS
quaries through Tor.  Yes, "Tor-Dns-Proxy" is one available solution,
another solution is "TorDNS-Localhostv v.1.7".  These
apps capture all DNS quaries and route them through
Tor.  Tor-Dns-Proxy can be run from command line or as a
service.  Unfortunitly, I am unable to run
Tor-Dns-Proxy as a service becasue the service won't
start.  In my testes I ran it from command line.  The
only problem I have with Tor-Dns-Proxy is the command
line mode requires end-user input...You can't run
"start Tor-Dns-Proxy" and have it launch, you need to
type "continue" then it will begin routing the DNS
quaries.  *I am emailing the authors to request automatic
running of Tor-Dns-Proxy via. "start Tor-Dns-Proxy".
TorDNS-Localhost v.1.7 does not run as a service but
can be lauched from command line without extra
end-user input.  TorDNS-Localhost has a nice GUI that
shows the real-time routing of DNS quaries so you can
see it in action.  Also, if DNS routing slows you can
clear the cache with the click of a button.
I use TorDNS-Localhost but I would prefer to use
Tor-Dns-Proxy.  The only reason I *don't* use
Tor-Dns-Proxy is I can not automatically start it via.
command line (hopefully the author will correct this).
No, Freecap does not fix DNS leakage as it uses
Socks5.  If you want to use a "socksifying" app I
suggest TorCap or TorCap2; TorCap and TorCap2 use
Socks4a.  TorCap is run completly from command line
but it can't route the app "Stunnel" (usefull for
Remailng).  TorCap2 uses a GUI and can route Stuennel.
Hope this doesn't confuse you and is helpfull,

Hi Fabian,
If you use it together with a decent packet filter,
you can make sure that there is no unencrypted
DNS traffic and connections from broken applications are
redirected into dns-proxy-tor or just fail.
If the Windows DNS server is configure to route into 127.0.0.1 (tor-dns-proxy) or 127.1.2.2 (TorDNS-Localhost) then a packet filter should not be required correct?
Even if a broken app used it's default, wouldn't the Windows DNS server _force_ the app to use the configured Windows DNS server address?
Setting the "Preferred DNS Server" in Network Connetions should force all DNS quaries into the specified address, correct?

Hi tup :-) Personally I don't trust most apps to support Socks5
correctly.  To error on the side of caution I use a
local DNS server. IMHO Dns-Proxy-Tor is superior to
all others...Great Job!
Well, when I launch your app via. the command "start dns-proxy-tor.exe" and type "continue" in the
resulting Dns-Proxy-Tor command window, then hit
[Enter] your app lauches _without_ installing as a
service and begins processing DNS quaries.  I have verified this as "services.msc" doesn't show
the service 'Dns-Proxy-Tor' if your app is started
with the "continue" command as I described above.
I was unaware that Dns-Proxy-Tor will process DNS
quaries without showing "started", thanks for the tip.
I posted my fist email from memory and I just
re-tested your app for clairifaction.
When Dns-Proxy-Tor is started via. double-clicking the
.exe or via. the command "start dns-proxy-tor.exe" the
resulting Dns-Proxy-Tor command window offers an
option to install the service (eg. type "install" and
hit [Enter]).  Or, an end user may type "continue" and
hit [Enter] to start running Dns-Proxy-Tor _without_
installing it as a service.
In the past I have used your app _without_ intalling
it as a service because it would never show "started".
 I assumed it was not running properly and hence was
not processing DNS quaries properly.  This is why I
mentioned typing "continue" to run it without
installing it as a service.
When I use the command "dns-proxy-tor.exe -start"
Windows attempts to start the service (which takes 2-3
minutes) before I get the error Dns-Proxy-Tor failed
to start.  Because attempting to start the Dns-Proxy-Tor service
takes 2-3 minutes I run your app without installing it
as a service.  But, when I launch your app without installing it as a
service (via. the command "start Dns-Proxy-Tor.exe")
the resulting Dns-Proxy-Tor command window _requires_
end-user input in the form of typing "continue" and
the hitting [Enter] key.  Unfortunitly, either method of lauching Dns-Proxy-Tor
(as a service or not) requires processes I would
rather avoid (eg. 2-3 minutes to process "-start" or
typing "continue").
I really like your app and I like the fact Tor
developers recommend it.  I would really like to use
it but the negative apects I have outlined prevent me
from doing so.
I hope this email is clear and rational ;-) Anogeorgeo

Hi Arrakistor,
 Will it incorporate as an sfx archive?
UPX doesn't compress as an archive it only reduces the size of .exe's and .dll's.  You could compress with UPX then 7zip into an SFX to _possibly_ get better compression ratios than either alone.
It runs via. commnad line and can take wild cards but it doesn't do sub-folders so you have to specify all the folders with .exe's or .dll's you wish to compress...For example:
 off
upx --best -qqq C:\Directory-A\*
upx --best -qqq C:\DIrectory-A\1\*
upx --best -qqq C:\Directory-A\1\2\*

Hi Arrakistor,
Agreed.  UPX does not play well with some .exe's and
.dll's.  I have noticed that after  UPXing firefox (all files
not just firefox.exe) and using the find text feature
[...Edit > Find in this page...] firefox will freeze
and require a re-start.  I noticed this on v.1.5 but I
havn't tested it on later versions.  Note that I
haven't tested it with the portable versions of
Firefox, just the full program.
Personally I don't think it's needed or especially
effective...Here are some issues worth concidering:
What OS an end-user runs.  If they use Windows (for
example) it _may_ be useless as there are countless

IMO the best option with today's modern hardware

Dod).  Please see the epilogue to Peter Guttmann's
paper "Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and
Solid-State Memory"

"For any modern PRML/EPRML drive, a few passes of
random scrubbing is the best you can do...A good
scrubbing with random data will do about as well as

Will it confuse end-users?  Will they click the button
without realizing it's consequence?  4. It may be a better option for you to suggest end-users
only install your app on an encrypted USB.  It would
be faster and more secure to re-encrypt the USB then
shredding the FF directory.

@_subject: Torpark 1.5.0.6 Pre-release 
Hi Arrakistor,
Wear-levelling (TrueFFS) is another security issue to
concider as USB are not magnetic you can't be postive
all data has been over-written properly (if they'r
using wear-levelling that is).  As a fix for this an
end-user can format there USB with a file-system (eg.
Fat, NTFS, UFS, etc) which _should_ fix the security
Please see this 01' paper by Perter Guttmann "Data
Remanence in Semiconductor Devices" (see section 6.4):
Here is a great and relevent thread from TC forums:
Quote: (again formatting the USB with file system should fix
this issue)
USB drives use wear-levelling algorithms - sort of a
low level file format that resides in the key and is
lower level than the operating system's file system.
Whenever a file is written to the USB key, it
distrubtes the file in a psuedo-random fashion across
the key's memory cells so that no one cell gets
written too many times. This extends the operative
life of the key because any one memory cell has a
limited number of writes before it dies. Therefore,
since most shredding alog's essentially write files
full of random data a certain number of times, there
is no way of knowing if the particular data you wanted
"erased" has in fact been overwritten even once.
P.S. Maybe TorPark should have it's own mailing list
to keep this one clean?

Start TorCap2 and the GUI loads, input host:port and exe. path into GUI just as you did with command line TorCap.  Then click the "launch" button and you off.

as Live IP Address status bar address is in BLACK and
ShowIP address is in RED.  Live IP Address Quote:
"In the currect version the following features are
functioned: i) By single-clicking on the IP address
field in Firefox's status bar, the extension checks
for changes in the IP value. ii) Under the Tools
menu-item, an entry called Live IP Address has been
added which reveals 3 sub-menu options: a) Copy Live
IP Address, b) Force Update Now and c) Set Update
Interval. iii) When the user right clicks inside the
web browser, the right-click list displays a new entry
called "Copy Live IP Address", if the user select this
option a prompt box pops up displaying the IP, where
the user may copy that into the clipboard. iv) Two
more IP-Finders have been added (out of 3) to make the
extension more reliable and robust."

@_subject: UTC & increased anonymity for client/node & user 
Can Tor function properly as a client and/or node if I
set my system's time to UTC?
UTC has the advantage of not giving away geographical
location.  Another advantage could be more universal
time standard for client/node; thus reducing partition
attacks via. time-zone/geographical location.
Some programs for protocols like some IM's (e.g. IRC)
will respond to a "CTCP Time" request.  If the system
time is set to UTC a CTCP Time request gives
non-usefull data to an adversary.  While a node does not have to worry about giving away
it's location a client does.
Opinions please?

Hi Peter,
What do you think about adding an automatic "convert
system time to UTC" feature into Tor?  For expample Tor could read the local system time,
convert it to UTC and then Tor can use the UTC version
for it's time related functions.  This seems like it
may reduce the strength of partition attacks via. TZ.
I am not sure if this would be too CPU intensive but
it wouldn't seem so.
Do you have a suggestion for a free open-source prog.
which can update/convert the local system time to UTC?
(I run Windows XPHome SP2)
I was thinking of using the UTC updater/converter from
NIST "Internet Time Service"(
 ).  The NIST
website offers a program which updates/converts the
system clock with UTC.
I was going to route the UTC updater/converter over
Tor via. FreeCap; I also use TorDNS so leaks are no
NIST uses the US Naval Observatory Master Clock at (
 ).  I'm not sure about the anonymity and security concerns
when using the US Navay's clock.  Is it risky (in
terms of anonymity) to use the Navay's clock?  I
assume as long as the UTC prog. is routed through Tor
and DNS is fixed there is minimal risk.

Hi Matt,
Thanks for the clarification and the efforts both of
you have put forth to create TorCP and Vidalia; good
Without going too far off-topic I have a question
about configuring the torrc when Vidalia is installed.
Say I have 'torrc' and 'torrc.orig.1' and I need to
add "Address" or "AccountingMax"; would I add these to
the torrc.orig.1 or the new torrc?
It seems I could add them to the torrc as the torrc
has my Bandwith config settings which are not removed
when I re-configure Vidalia. Or, when Tor exicutes SETCONF (after Vidalia's 'save'
button is clicked) is the torrc.orig.1 file re-parsed
by Tor and then copied into the torrc along with the
settings made via. Vidalia? The reason I ask is the comments in the torrc imply it
should not be manually edited.

IMO these comments at the top of the torrc file imply
the torrc should not be manually edited:
This file was generated by Tor; if you edit it,
comments will not be preserved.  If you want a config file with comments, look for
torrc.orig.1 or similar
For example, the sentence "...if you edit it, comments
will not be preserved." seems to imply that each time
Vidalia is configured the settings in the torrc are
wiped and a new ones are added. Thus removing any
end-user added comments and/or settings(-I know this
is not the case-).  The senctence "If you want a config file with
comments, look for torrc.orig.1 or similar" seems to
imply an end-user should edit the 'torrc.orig.%' if
they wish to add comments and/or commands.  The first sentence says end-user added comments will
not be retained in the torrc.  The second sentence
says an end-user should look in 'torrc.orig.%' for
comments.  This seems to imply comments/commands
should be added to the 'torrc.orig.%' as they are not
preserved in the torrc.
Overall, I think most of the confusion comes from the
vaugeness of the comments in the new torrc.  Also,
many end-users are not fimilar or comfortable with a
concept as simple as comments(    I humbly suggest something along these lines:
This is an autogenerated file created by Tor when you
update and save settings from within Vidalia.  The
original, non-autogenerated torrc has been renamed to
The settings from 'torrc.orig.%' have been imported
into this new 'torrc' file.  If you wish to manually
add/edit Tor settings please do so from within this
file.  Do not add comments( to this file as they are
not retained, only settings are retained by this file.
If you wish to read the original, non-autogenerated
torrc file please see 'torrc.orig.%'.

@_subject: Vidalia 
Can you describe these bugs?  I run Windows XP Home and Vidalia v.0.0.4 has shown zero bugs so far.  TorCP on the other hand was pretty buggy, especially when you used it to configure a server (it crashed everytime).
See my statment above.
When Vidalia starts for the first time it reads your torrc and imports your config settings into a new 'torrc' file it creates.  Your original torric is now called 'torrc.orig.x' (where 'x' is most likly '1').  The new torrc file uses all the settings from your original torrc (which were imported by Vidalia).  When you use Vidalia to cinfigure Tor (ie. to become a
server) Vidalia updates the torrc file it created with
this new configuration setting.  Registry keys are also used by Vidalia in Windows XP
save configuration settings.  When you configure Vidalia two reg keys are updated (along with the torrc).  These reg keys only contain configurations supported through Vidalia (eg. no 'bandwith rate limiting', this would be in the torrc).
Vidalia seems to use these keys as a 'master' config setting and as a 'backup' for the torrc.  If the torrc
uses the server nic "A" and the reg keys use server
nic "B" Vidalia will use server nic "B".
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\vidalia I am very happy with Vidalia and I like where it is going; v.0.0.5 looks good.  The creator of Vidalia is open to suggestions and feature requests.  I requested a feature in Vidalia that shows your private (local) and public (exit node) IP addresses when you mouse over the system tray icon.  Within an hour the author of Vidalia wrote to me and said he would impliment this in v.0.0.5.
Tor is not stable and will not be stable for a long
Hell, the first Tor GUI I uses was called "TorControl"
and then came "TorCP" and now "Vidalia".  I must say
with each succession the GUI's have progressed leaps
and bounds.  IMO Vidalia is a great GUI with alot of
potential and an author who is very motivated. Vidalia is an onion.  Tor is a client/server program
which uses the Onoin Route II to anonymize/secure The connection lies in that Vidalia is an onion and Vidalia is used to control Tor which utilizes the
Onion Route II.

@_subject: Freegate creator Bill Xia attacked by Chinese agents!!! 
I live on the South Eastern Coast of the US and I was
watching the news last night when I saw a report about
a home invasion of Mr. Xia.
Three Chinese men entered his house and threw him to
the floor then they beat him into unconsiousness. They beat him so badly he was in the hospital for 2
weeks,  he recived 17 stiches to his face and they
broke his jaw.
I saw a composite stetch of one of the attackers on
the news; Mr. Xia claims they work for the Chinese
government.  He claims he has recieved threats to his
well being and family due to his creation of Freegate.
 Mr. Xia accused the Chinese government of ordering
these men to attack him to force him to stop
Freegate's devolpment.
Mr. Xia was very, very badly beaten in the photos I
saw.  But, he refuses to stop Freegate's dev. and said
he belives Freegate is necessary to help the Chinese
people.  He fears for his family but he says Freegate
is too important to stop dev.  My deepest respect and
honor goes to Mr. Xia; he is truly a hero for standing
up to the Chinese gov. and offering freedom for it's
people; even at the risk of his own life.
The US gov. has launched an investagation according to
the news segment into the home invasion.  Things could
get very sticky for the Chinese gov. if it's proven
they ordered the attack.  But, I have no doubts they
did; why else would 3 Chinese men attack him in his
home and not steal one thing.
Let us hope this is not a sign of things to come when
people stand up for basic human rights...

Hello Mr. Goodell,
Well, I searched the net for the last hour or so and I
couln't find any info about this attack or the news
station that aired it last night.
I called all the news stations I could find that
broadcast in my area and none claimed to have aired
it.  I wish I could remember the station channel that
aired it on the 11:00 o'clock news (channel 3 or 5 I
think).   It's possible that it is too soon to have
this segments info on the news channel's site.
Station WBS-TV on channel 2 aired a segment on this
attack about 2 weeks ago.  I spoke to the WBS-TV news
desk and they confirmend they aired the segement. But,
I searched their site but I couldn't find any links.  I tried calling the police department where he lives
but they couldn't give me any detials without his home
address which I don't have.  The person I spoke with
did mention she remembered the incident but she didn't
If you have his phone number or email maybe you could
contact him and ask if he's doning well.
When I saw the intervew with him last night he looked
*ALOT* better then he did in the phot0s just after the
beating.  He has a scar over his right eyebrow and
below his right eye. This is were he recieved the
stiches.  His left eye was very badly swollen and
brused in the intial photos but in the interview last
night his left eye looked much better.
He seems like a very kind and honest person; it's a
shame what happened to him.
I'll try to find more info in a few days, maybe then
the news channel which aired the segment will have
info on their site.
Let us know if you speak to him and how he is doing,

Here is a quoted section from an article about the US
FBI and the next generation of "Carnivore" which will
focus on VoIP.
The qutoed section deals with a MiTH attack (I think)
that has been discussed here before.  The attacker
adds a packet timing delay and invisable 'tag' to
packets of the P2P VoIP software "SkyPE".
This MiTH attack defeated the anonymity offered by
 and as such everyone should
concider all other web-based, single-hop and weak [eg.
non-Tor ;-) ] anonymizing services to be broken.
I don't think this MiTH attack can effect the Tor
network but I'm not sure.  I think Tor's DH key
authentication of nodes and TLS tunnels precludes this
attack but I'm not positive.
Can an Onion Route II/Tor expert offer assurance this
MiTH attack does not effect Tor?
-Quoted section-
The FBI or any other government agency that's
eavesdropping on both ends of the link would see that
each person was connected to the anonymizing
server--but couldn't know for sure who was talking to
whom. The more customers who use the service at once,
the more difficult it would be for investigators to
connect the dots.
Wang discovered he could embed a unique, undetectable
signature in Skype packets and then identify that
signature when they reached their destination. The
technique works in much the same way as a radioactive
marker that a patient swallows, permitting doctors to
monitor its progress through the digestive system.
"It's based on the flow itself," Wang said. "I embed a
watermark into the flow itself, the timing of the
packets. By adjusting the timing of select packets
slightly, it's transparent. There's no overhead in the
bandwidth, and it's very subtle. It's mingled with the
background noise." (The anonymizing service tested was
Findnot.com, which did not immediately respond to a
request for comment on Tuesday.)
A paper co-authored by Wang and fellow George Mason
researchers Shiping Chen and Sushil Jajodia describing
their results is scheduled to be presented at a
computer security conference in November. An early
draft concludes that "tracking anonymous, peer-to-peer
VoIP calls on the Internet is feasible" with only
3-millisecond timing alterations as long as the calls
are at least 90 seconds long. -End quoted section-

@_subject: "User.Actions" Template (Was: Re: Threats to anonymity set at and above the application layer; HTTP headers) 
Hi Seth,
browser > headers, and then try to convince as many
Tor users I completly agree.
I am posting my "user.actions" file which I humbly
submit as a starting point.
My actions file is locked down and blocks/spoofs
everything Privoxy allows while attempting to stay in
a large (and 'typical') anonymity set.  I do not use
paramiters that will break sites; my actions file does
not break any sites I use it with.
I do not block cookies with Priovxy as I prefer to
block/allow cookies with FireFox and FireFox
extensions.  IMO it is eaiser for an end-user to make
an informed 'case-by-case' decision in regards to
cookies or to set FireFox (or FF extensions) to
block/allow cookies.  The same idea applies to all
script (eg. Java, Shockwave, etc).
The "user.actions" file is confusing for non-tech
end-users so IMO it is best to limit their access to
it.  Any configurations that can be made with
FireFox/FF extesions (or other browsers), or a
Firewall GUI is IMO better than having non-tech
end-users fumbling with the Privoxy config files.
I think it is wise to note that Privoxy can not filter
HTTPS.  Most non-tech end-users do not know this.  I
do not block HTTPS connections as I think it is
easiser to simply not visit an HTTPS url.  There are
very legimite uses for HTTPS (eg. online banking) and
an end-user can make a quick, informed decision.
A word of caution for the variable "User_Agent"; I am
using a universal Mozilla/FireFox line with Windows XP
as the OS and "en" (english, non-localized) as the
language.  I choose Windows XP as most non-tech
end-users use Windows XP these days.  The same idea
applies to FireFox for the browser.  The problem with
spoofing User-Agent only use 'en' is the
"HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE" variable can not be set by
Privoxy 3.0.3.  Someone posted a link to a patch for
Privoxy which allows "Accept_Lang" spoofing.  But, IMO
not many non-tech end-users are going to apply this
patch.  I do not think Privoxy can be bundled with the
patch as it is not official.
I used the IE bug fix option incase end-users need
this fix but have not applied it.
Below I posted the relevent section of my
"user.actions" file and the "ProxyJudge V2.35" results
and with some usefull links.

@_subject: Threats to anonymity set at and above the application layer; HTTP headers 
Hi Nick,
IMO a needed and important feature of any
'filtering/scrubbing' proxy appliction is some sort of
'on-the-fly' decryption>scrubbing>encryption scheme
for ingress/egress HTTPS traffic.
If the appliction could do on-the-fly HTTPS filtering
it would solve our problem.  Not to metion how much
trouble non-tech end-users will have grapsing the
concept of HTTP vs. HTTPS and their related
anonymity/security issues.  Even more difficult for
most end-users will be configuring Privoxy correctly;
imagine if the end-user does not read/comprehend
English well. I believe proxomitron [ ;-) ] at one time had an
on-the-fly decryption>scrubbing>encryption feature for
HTTPS ingress/egress traffic on the to-do list.  This
feature was never implimented and there was concern
about the security of on-the-fly
decryption>scrubbing>encryption of HTTPS traffic by
any proxy appliction.
Phillip Zimmermann just released his new VoIP
encryption program called "Zfone".  Zfone
encrypts/decrypts VoIP traffic on-the-fly; much as I
envision the proxy appliction would work with HTTPS
traffic.  Zfone captures and encrypts the VoIP egress
traffic after it leaves the VoIP appliction.  Zfone
then captuers and decrypts the VoIP ingress traffic
before it reaches the VoIP appliction.

Those are valid points and to be honest I did not
concider the possibility malicous HTTPS content on a
HTTP web site.
To that end I have updated my user.actions file to
block all "HTTP CONNECT" attempts via. HTTPS (by using
"limit-connect").  By blocking the CONNECT attempts
Privoxy does not forward HTTPS traffic.  I set the "limit-connect" paramiter to "Port -1"
(essentially Port "0") which does not exist and thus
blocked by Privoxy.  I tried using "limit-connect{0}"
and "forward :443 ." (in "config.txt") but neither of
those worked properly.
IMO "limit-connect" is the most 'user-friendly' method
to block\unblock HTTPS traffic.

@_subject: "User.Actions" Template 
The update for the 'user.actions' template allows for
an end-user to enter any number of HTTPS URL's that
they wish to access through Tor.  These HTTPS URL's
have priority over the defult blocking of HTTPS
traffic.  You can access the HTTPS sites you specify
but all other HTTPS traffic is blocked by default.
IMO I would rather use a non-HTTPS connection to allow
for filtering which offers a good deal of anonymity.  When I am not using an HTTPS connection I do not
transmit any personally identifable information,
credit-card numbers, real name, etc.  If I want to visit a site I trust, where I am going to
transmit my credit-card number or home phone I
generally use a HTTPS connetion.
Level of trust is an important issue when you decide
which HTTPS URL's you choose to allow.  Do You Yahoo!?

@_subject: Easy Firefox hacks to improve anonymity (HTTPS Header Scrubbing) 
There has been bit of dicussion latley about filtering
HTTP/S environmental variable headers and creating a
default HTTP/S header template for Tor users.
The last big hurdle (now solved) in header scrubbing
is the scrubbing of HTTPS headers.  I think the solution is to use Firefox or FF
extensions to filter the HTTPS headers as FF and FF
extensions have access to the verifed and decrypted
HTTPS headers on-the-fly by default.
I will describe how to edit the "about:config" menu
and  how to configure the FF extensions "User Agent
Switcher" and "RefControl".
The goal is to enable HTTPS header scrubbing while
using the *same* anonymity set charastics as those
which may be used by future relases of Tor bundled
with Privoxy (using the default template).
For example, FF and FF extensions should make the
HTTPS headers identical the HTTP headers created by
Privoxy.  Thus inceasing the anonymity set and
everyone's anonymity in general.
The anonymity set that I am attempting to use is as
A. User-Agent: Mozilla, Windows XP, 128-bit encryption, English
(non-localized), Firefox.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en;
rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.5
B. Referer(Referrer):
Is set to the root (home page) of the site you are
currently visiting (eg."
I think it is wise to use {forge} for the template
Referer setting.  If we use a real domain with the
{custom} paramiter it may get Tor in trouble with the
real domain's owners.  I am pretty sure we can not use
{block} as it breakes many sites.
Note: HTTPS referrer from one HTTPS URL directly to another
HTTPS URL is set to {block} incase RegControl can not
properly handle these headers.  This is because I have
not tested (and I don't know) HTTPS to HTTPS referrer
headers.  -Can 'referer' {custom} be set to a fake URL without
breaking sites?
- 'referer' {forge} will generate random headers for
Tor users, will this increase anonymity set?
C. Keep-Alive:
D. Compression:
E. X-Forwarded-for:
Not removed or spoofed as FF does not have this
capibility.  Besides, the entry node removes your real
"X-Forwarded-for:" header and it already has your real
F. Ping:
FF will supress the Ping function in HTTP/S.
(More testing required)
1. Results from HTTPS (eg. SSL) envrionmental variable
test at
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en;
rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.5

navigating from a https site to another https site.
4. -Keep-Alive(proxy connection)-
4a. Copy/paste the following line into the "Filter:"
4b. Right click on the title and choose "toggle"
ensure the 'Value' entry reads "False".
{false} = Never use keep-alive connections.
5. -Keep-Alive-
5a. Copy/paste the following line into the "Filter:"
5b. Right click on the title and choose "toggle"
ensure the 'Value' entry reads "False".

6. -Accept-Encoding-
Prevent compression of HTTP/S data.
6a. Copy/paste the following line into the "Filter:"
6b. Right click on the title and choose "modify".
6c. Delete the text from the box and copy/paste the
following line into the box:
6d. Now click "OK"
{gzip;q=0,deflate;q=0,compress;q=0} = No compression 7. -Send Ping-
7a. This option is not required, you do not need to
use it.
7b. Right click anywhere in the 'about:config' window
and select "New > Boolean".
7c. Copy/paste the following line into the 'Perference
Name" box:
"Browser.send pings"
7d. In the next window select "false"
{false} = Ignore the ping attribute.
8. -User_Agent-
"User Agent Switcher" is a great FireFox extension.
8a. Install "User Agent Switcher"
8b. Restart Firefox
8c. Click on "Tools > User Agent Switcher > Options >
8d. In the next window click the text "User Agents"
8e. Then click the "Add" button and enter the

@_subject: Easy Firefox hacks to improve anonymity (HTTPS Header Scrubbing) 
Please see number (8) in the "Directions" section. This is where I describe how to install and configure
UAS only handles User-Agent headers but the
"about:config" edits I describe also scrub
Referer(Referrer), Compression and Keep-Alive.  I like using the Privoxy configuration and the FF
hacks I describe as they are redundant in regards to
HTTP filtering; incase one misses something the other
may scrub it.
I think this method needs further testing as I
'developed' this method on 05-21-06.  As far as I've
found it works as stated: HTTP and HTTPS headers are
filtered using the same anonymity set.
Other possibilites to increase anonymity and anonymity
*Please let me know your opinion*
1. -Accept-Languages-
I am going to update my thread with this to match the
lang in "User-Agent".  I will use English
"intl.accept_languages" = {en}
2. -Accept-Default-
It seems wise to use a 'stantard' and 'universal'
setting to increase the anonymity set.  Here I am
trying to use an all-purpose setting that eveyone can
use regardless of local(and possible language) which
accounts for all possbile scenarios.
Note: The following line should not be wrapped:
3. -Accept-Charsets-
Again, it seems wise to use a 'stantard' and
'universal' setting to increase the anonymity set. Here I am trying to use an all-purpose setting that
eveyone can use regardless of local(and possible
language) which accounts for all possbile scenarios.
"intl.accept_charsets" = {ISO-8859-1,*}
{ISO-8859-1,*} means universal Charset (non-regional,
non-localized) and all others.

The past two versions of Tor (v.0.1.1.23 and v.0.1.2.1-alpha) have taken awhile to be built/released for Windows (the latter still is MIA).  I know this is because you guys don't have a Windows box and I think the person who used to do the Windows build isn't doing so anymore?
I would wager that 60-70% of Tor users (clients) run Windows and of that percent I would guess 95% dont' know how to build Tor from source.  I have been trying to build for a week now and can't get it done either.
So, if someone sent you guys a legal non-OEM Windows XP Home SP2 installation Cd would you put this on a box and try to release the Widnows builds along with the *nix builds?
I am offering to buy and send you this Cd buy the 3rd week of September.  Would you be interested in my offer?  Would this allow the Windows builds to be released in a timely fashion along side the *nix builds?

@_subject: Tor Defense Fund...an idea. 
Tor server operators are more frequently subject to government action due to the fact they are running an exit or entry node.  IMO this will cause some operators to shutdown their nodes to avoid legal repercussions and/or the monetary damages that can be incurred (from fines or legal defense).
I propose a fund (eg. "Tor Defense Fund") that would be available to server operators engaged in legal battles.  The TDF would be funded by donations from other Tor users, as it would be in  their best interest to donate if they wish to keep the Tor network running well. Maybe the EFF would consider running the fund and paying out X amount of dollars to each operator who meets a certain criteria?

@_subject: Tor Defense Fund...an idea. 
An amusing subtext in this is that issue of social reward which came up
in discussions about how to encourage tor servers to appear. I'm
inclined to suggest that a firehose blasting would work better, find an
effective way to get more people to run tor nodes, and it goes from
victimisation to class action.
Well, I know Roger, Nick, etc are against it but making Tor run as a server by default may be worth more consideration (I2P does this).  Also, I've read posts about the possibility of offering better speed/etc to clients who also operate servers, this may be the best option.
A class-action would be the best option but I believe it would be hard/impossible to make a class-action with operators in different countries due in part to how each country handles class-actions (or if they allow them at all).  This would mean a class-action in Germany by German operators and a class-action in France by French operators, etc, etc.  It may be more feasible to offer monetary help with legal defense and fines incurred to individual operators than try to launch class-actions in each country.

Quote by Phobos:
I'm working towards building the official win32 binaries going forward.  I'm hoping to have something together for 0.1.2.1-alpha by the weekend.  We'll see how it goes. It looks like Phobos is kind enough to do the official
Win32 builds for the community.

I believe speed in the Tor network is less dependend
upon high speed connections than it is upon the Tor
network itself...of course dial-up is another story...
This is a good point and I bet they would be just as
interested in helping with individual lawsuits as they
would class-action lawsuits.  Besides, a successful
challange to a single lawsuite would create precedence
that other courts would be inclined to follow (in the
US at least).
My original point is still vaild though, a
class-action in multiple countries would be very
difficult if not impossible.  Thus it seems it may be
necessary to make a different class-action in each
country due to each countries specific class-action

likely Well, in terms of the Tor network I believe the
authorities concider the possibility of shutting down
the network to be of utmost value.
IMO the authorities in this case don't really care if
an operator has anything of value as they seek to
prevent their citizens from gaining anonymity.

Have you read this security advisory? It may be better to wait until this is fixed in an
upcomming release. Note: I'm assuming this will be
fixed in the next alpha release. I've been wrestling with compiling 0.1.2.1-a for the
past few days.  Are you albe to compile on Win32?  If
so could you post your steps?
Thanks, Anogeorgeo

Suggestion for the coders .. make the client test itself and adjust the exit policy on the fly.
IMO making all Tor clients also function as MiddleMan Nodes, RPs, etc (all *except* Entry and Exit nodes) would be a good move.  It might be good to also make Tor clients function as Entry nodes (not Entry Guards) to increase their usefulness.
Just a few quick thoughts:
A default bandwith rate on the low to minimum side would be a good.  It may also be good to make two instances of Tor start when an end-user starts Tor.  One instance would be the client and the other would be the server (w/ "SocksPort 0").  How low will we go? Check out Yahoo! Messenger?s low  PC-to-Phone call rates.

This isn't always true, I used port 25 thru tor last week. I'd revise
your statement to:
You sometimes can't send via smtp from tor, because some exit nodes don't
permit port 25 traffic.
Or you can use a service that offers SMTP on ports other than 25, Gmail and Softhome are two examples.

Hi Fabian,
Thanks for the heads up.  I may be wise to also report this behaviour to the
Firefox forums or bugzilla.  Maybe the devs. will make
FF provide a warning or an about:config setting to
prevent https to http redirects.

Yes, but 0.1.2.1-a does not include the fix and is
vuneralbe to this issue.  Versions affected:
  The experimental snapshot 0.1.2.1-alpha-cvs.
