@_subject: [Interoperability] Tor and GNU Anubis 
I am trying to setup GNU Anubis to connect to a Tor
instance. GNU Anubis is a mail processor/mail relay
that comes with a built-in Socks 4 and Socks 5 client.
GNU Anubis sucessfully connects to the Tor server
but never sends the email message. I am using my
ISPs mail server which should finally deliver the
mail to the recipient.
How can I tweak Tor's configuration to write more
verbose debug message to the debug log? I really
want to know what is going on.
This is my GNU Anubis configuration:
remote-mta 217.9.16.16:25 # -> Mail server of my ISP
socks-proxy 127.0.0.1:9050 # -> Tor instance
socks-v4 no # -> GNU Anubis should talk SOCKS 5

OK, here comes my next question:
My ISP's mail server alows connection from the IP
84.252.66.2 (that's smtp.daniel-s-haischt.biz).
So should I use that IP instead? If yes how should
I setup my mail server (again that's
smtp.daniel-s-haischt.biz) to accept torriefied
Currently I did setup my mail server to accept
valid SMTP AUTH connections ...
Beside that - Does it make sense to torrify smtp

@_subject: [QUESTION] Banned host names 
a couple of sec. ago I did try to connect to
irc.freenode.net using Tor. Unfortunatly I got
this error message:
(22:17:18) tolkien.freenode.net: (notice)
*** Banned: levin; this host is in active
use by GNAA kiddies [paulsucks
(2005/01/07 19.55)
How offten does this happen. I think if Tor
host are getting banned very offten, this
service might become quite unusable ...

@_subject: unsubscribe 
don't send mails to the mailing list if you want to unsubscribe.
Instead you need to send them to the mailing list management
software (majordomo or whatever).
