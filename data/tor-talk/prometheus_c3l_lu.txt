Would be great! We have reserved a table at Big Mama's [0], may be you
want to join us there and we'll start off?

Good evening fellow list,
As there are apparently some Tor operators on FOSDEM [0], I would like
to know if there is any meet-up scheduled fr them? If not, I would put
myself forward to organize such a meet-up like on 30C3, if there is a
need for it. :)
