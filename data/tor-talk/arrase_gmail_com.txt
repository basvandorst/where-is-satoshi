Hi list,
This is my first post
What do you think about that?, can be good or is a waste of time?
- The problem:
Many sites at TOR network have multiple mirrors for support their user load.
When connecting to one of these mirror sites we can have the following
Is this the right place or is a service impersonation?
- My proposal:
The client who wants to verify if a service is fake or real can download
the PGP key of the service and send a challenge to a port of the service.
The challenge is a simple string defined by the client and the server must
respond with the same string with a valid GPG signature to identify himself
Some code (work in progress):

yes, you need to know the real public key of the service previously , but
that happens whenever you use gpg, you need to get the public key of a
trusted source

I would like to explain this more in deep from the point of view of the
final user, the one who wants to know about the identity behind a mirror of
a service.
The client has an extension installed in the browser.
The client go into a domain for first time
The client decided than that service is good for him and he would like to
know in the future if a mirror of the service is from the same author
The extension notes the client about that site is running hidden service
The client accepts the data offered from the service to identify mirrors in
the future , just clicking on extension icon
Next time the client go into a service who claims to be a mirror of the
original one the extension uses the stored info to advice the client if is
realy true or if it is scam

El 26 oct. 2016 3:17 a. m., "Michael" and have some concerns and some suggestions...
administrator is using keys vulnerable to "known word" attacks, below is a
link to the severity and key types effected.
data for servers to process is fraught with danger... I will confess that I
didn't read deep enough into the servers' side to inspect if the received
strings where being scrubbed, nor do I have the expertise to know what that
would look like in Python but I've enough knowledge to know that it's
though no matter the language
You're right , casually I have modified the algorithm a few hours ago for
that reason :).
I am in the process of developing the idea and all comments are welcome.
English is not my native language so I'll read the rest of your mail
Greetings and good night :)

Tor is great but can be better.
Tor needs services to push the standards and grow as a community.
The Tor network must be builded from their users.
The anonymity of the network is a chance to open the web of trust to a new
level where you trust in someone only by their acts no matter the color of
his skin or the way he lives his life.
The concept of hidden services verification is an starting point:
This concept opens a chance , a chance to build a trusted Tor-Only network
of services like a free DNS service for add more friendly domains to the
network and simple round robin load balance for sites with multiple trusted
replicas, a trusted tor-only irc network , ......
All of this must be build by us, the Tor users.
A lot of us are IT professionals, programers, hackers, geeks, .... we can
do that in the right way to be something great but we need to collaborate.
We can make someting like a foundation, managed by the users who like to be
involved in the build of the social and technological infraestructure
needed to do something like that.
Is our oportunity to build a realy free network for all.
What do you think?
a) ... this is kid is on drugs.
b) ... fucked hippy.
c) ... is not possible
d) ... could be good if you can do it
e) ... well, why not? i can help
f) .... fuck yeah! let's do it
g)

Now you can ask, what is a trusted service?
A service with the privacy and the transparency as mainstream
A trusted service must be:
- Implemented with open code
- Managed by a group of users with good reputation, that group can't be
- Periodically auditable by the comunity in all his deep (even accessing to
the machines running the service by independent groups of auditors selected
by the comunity)
- Gpg signed
