@_subject: Filtering traffic from your node - for exit points 
Yes. I suggest to run exit node in a relatively FREE country.
If someone is not free to run an exit node and has to filter some
content. DO NOT run it. If your ISP has something filtering like Great
Firewall in China, DO NOT run it. Because your exit node is not
totally accessible and is worse than nothing. Tor users using your
exit node don't have full access to the internet. That is VERY BAD.
Run it as a middle man instead.
