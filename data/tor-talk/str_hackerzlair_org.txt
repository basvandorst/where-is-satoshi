@_subject: Advanced traffic shaping with iptables? 
Burst bandwidth wouldn't hurt the network.
If you want bandwidth shaping, I'd suggest using pf (Open/FreeBSD) for
traffic shaping.
iptables + tc never did the job for me and it's the reason I tried pf in the
first place.
Pf has incredibly legible syntax and reading the pf faq will get you up and
running in no time.
