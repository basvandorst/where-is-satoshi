@_subject: [tor-talk] someone doesn't like my IP 
Hi. I'm pretty newbi here, and using Tor. Trying to visit a web page using Tor I found this message:
    "Access denied. Your IP address [188.138.1.229] is blacklisted. If you feel this is in error please contact your hosting providers abuse Is it usual? Why?
