@_subject: POST not anonymous? 
Dear Tor-friends,
On one of my machines I use tor for browsing. Just recently I did a submit
to a webform, and I would've liked to be anonymous this time, but in the
feedback I got from the submission, I saw my original IP address showing.
I'm using the w3m browser (textmode) and a chain of squid, privoxy, tor for
this activity. When I request  ,
I see one of the tor exit-nodes' ip address, however, in feedback from my
POST request, my own ipaddress was refered to. Does anybody have any idea
what I can have wrong in my settings?
kind regards,
- Merijn Vogel

Or it may have been my proxy settings, I guess the pitfall is a default
squid setting to let POST requests to cgi-bin like things be handled
directly rather than via the other cache, being privoxy. For being anonymous
in POSTing I should use privoxy directly, and not using squid.
