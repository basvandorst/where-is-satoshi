My response to provider was in mind of "Tor client cannot act as server, so
it is technically impossible to share bittorent thru Tor". This record above
about sharing is probably from any bittorent tracker, because if any client
will try to connect my server with bittorent protocol, it will fail.
I wrote to provider, that I stopped my Tor node until it will be clear, but

My algorithm is very simple - Im walking thru list of exit nodes
(filtered with some flags, not important in this case) and select
random relay to every exit. So final circuits are like:
[random_relay1, exit1]
[random_relay2, exit2] ...
These pairs are generated on each start of script, but behaviour
related to specific exit is the same - for example, today's morning
was this issue related to Fireduck - with any random_relay I choosed.
So I dont think that it is specific to /16 subnet restriction.

Minimal impact in case you have no users :-).
Is there any positive case to run exit, when you hibernate often? When
you use hibernation, you probably run Tor on laptop. So it takes many
hours to propagate your node across network and you dont have any
traffic for while. Then you hibernate computer and others will fail to
connect you for next hours... But it is good way to make job for

@_subject: Tor speed 
for my thesis, I tested speed of Tor and JAP (free service). Although JAP
was a little bit slower than circuits of Tor in benchmark tests, I was
surprised that JAP had much better user experience and acted as faster. So I
looked after reason and I think I found. JAP has almost constant throughput
(arount 57 kbit in my case) in the time, but Tor speed is fluctuating (from
zero to more than mbit!). So in JAP case, I looked to monitor and web page
was loading continuously. In Tor case, I looked to blank monitor for a
minute and then, suddenly, page was loaded. And because Im playing with tor
for a long time, I know it is usual behaviour...
Finally, average speed was around 57 kbit (JAP) and 70 kbit (Tor), but JAP
looked much better for use. And I would like to ask you, where is reason for
this Tor behaviour and if is there any possibility for improvement.
And sorry for my english, here is 2am and Im almost sleeping....

@_subject: Tor speed 
I know that latency is the real reason of user experience. But my speed
tests were averages for longer time and many requests. When I have faster
connection, but it feels much slower.
request > ..... noooothiiiing for minute > ........ page is loading in ten
seconds with all images (and bandwidth meter shows me speed above 140 kB/s).
request > .... few second for first response > slower, but continuous page
loading for longer than minute > done (and maximum speed wasnt better than
few kB/s)
Second behaviour is much better, because you feel the responsivity and in
some cases, you can read page until it is fully loaded.
Im asking, why is Tor different in this. Is there any reason in tor design
or it is simply not too optimized? Because in total, there IS enough
bandwidth on nodes (overal speed is sufficient).
Reason 1, latency)
I understand, that JAP (with most servers in germany) will be more
responsive than Tor, which have nodes around whole world and one request is
pending across continents. But: There are 3 nodes, me and target server (4
connections in line total). We can expect, that every node is on different
continent and on bad line (~ 400 ms latency). My latencies (Im 3ms to Czech
internet bone) to USA are around 140ms. So at total:
me -- 400 + 140 + 400 -- node1 --- 400 + 140 + 400 --- node2 --- 940 ---
node3 --- 940 --- target
==== 3760 ms for one-way, it is ~7,5 second to response in the WORST case!!
Dont tell me, that 940 ms is typical latency between nodes...
Reason 2, node overall throughput)
Slow responsibility can be done by slow nodes connection. But overall speed
is not a problem (not for me), because there IS enough connectivity, but
probably badly spread in time. Im running exit node (
and I can see, that my bandwidth is not used in the best way. Sometimes node
is idle and sometimes it hit the speed limits. In idle time is probably
everything ok - node is working on every request without own speed
limitation. But what in the case of short-time overloading? My tip is, that
in this case, node is working for somebody faster than for else. I think so,
because it can be the reason, why I often have ZERO throughput thru Tor for
tens seconds. My guess is that some nodes simply dont give me a slot for my
data, because somebody else is transfering something big, what "kill" the
bandwidth for a moment. And because there are three nodes in the line, it is
the big probability I "hit" this problem on more nodes - and I will finally
very slow responsibility.
Hight throughput on the end of request (as I wrote on begin) is also an
evidence - when I use so much bandwidth for a few seconds, somebody else
must wait. Because there are tens of users on one node, it support my idea.
Is there anybody, who knows, if it is possible?

One more comment. I blocked everything expect 80 and 443 for two reasons -
firstly, I had DMCA notifications (torrents) and I have not energy and time
to solve this. Second is, that "something else 80/443" overloaded my node
for the most of time. I like supporting anonymity and free access to
information, but I preffer access to WWW (with the best speed possible) than
supporting torrents.
Because I was surprised, how much throughput takes all these torrents and
non-WWW data, I tried run torrent over Tor for a while. I was much bigger
surprised, how hell fast it is! Is it the next evidence, that Tor have bad
QoS on connections?
Main differences between torrent stream and casual WWW is, that torrent
stream is built once, request data one and lives for long time. WWW (and
also SSH and others interactive stuff) is much more about multiple
request/reasons. I think that preferring short-live streams (or generally
young streams) in dividing node throughtput will do miracles! I think
currently is Tor doing the right oposite...

You are probably connected to some other Tor network than me :-). My exit
node was on 100% all the time, until I reject everything except HTTP(s)
I think torrents on tor is hard question. We cannot restrict Tor, but
torrenters are annoying us (right, me and some others). I prefer any kind of
port-oriented QoS or so. http should have more priority than non-generic
ports, because, probably, there are users waiting for responses. But it
probably much harder to do than block Tor ips in bittorent clients ;-).

@_date: 2009-02-18 23:26:26
@_author: slush 
@_subject: Bittorrent 
Well, me to.
Disagree. I wrote _port_ oriented QoS, not _content_.  There can be config
option to prioritize some port (port range) above other. Just because
somebody want to support HTTP transfer than other, but he dont want to fully
stop other services (torrents).
Simply I imagine that in same style like ExitPolicy. Did you ask others, why
are they using ExitPolicies? I dont think so. It is part of Tor and nobody
(as far as I know) is against - because it is free choice of relay operator
which kind of traffic he will support.
I know it is "barrelhouse talk". Im just talking it, because dont know, if
it was debated before. Unfortunately, it is long time ago, when I was able
to handle C code on sufficient level. So I cannot show any prototype of my
idea. Maybe it could be done by priorities on transparent proxy behind tor
exit. But is is ugly hack and non system solution.
What do you mean by it in discussed situation? I think priorities are not
against security and anonymity.

You probably mean "exit nodes already know"? Yes, they are and middles not.
Same as for ExitPolicy.
Of course, middle nodes have no idea about data they are transporting.
There isnt any relation between "type of traffic" (port) and user. Exit node
dont know this relation - and it is purpose of Tor. But exit nodes know
target IP/port (it is used in ExitPolicy construct) and I think it can be
handful to support also prioritization. With same reason as ExitPolicy. It
is technically possible and I donst see any security issue with that.

* Exit node knows target IP and port

Makes sense, if you are suggesting to add prioritization
I think it is very similar view to the same problem and it depends on ease
of possible implementation. Somebody has plenty of bandwidth and is happy
when it is used for tor, but feels that supporting (for example) HTTP is
better than torrents. With prioritization / portspeed limits, there wouldnt
be a reason to close non-https ports, just to give them slower performance.
Since there are very good legitimate reasons to want to
Im not sure it will work. When you tight up port 25, there will be the
same(similar) amount of spam, but because of speed restriction, there will
not be enough connectivity for regular users :-). With priorities, you will
be able to handle big amount of request, when your exit will have free

@_subject: Switching Tor relay speed 
Hi, I discuss to running high capacity Tor node on my univerzity in Czech
Republic. There is plenty of connectivity during night, but less during day.
In asking you, if you see any problem in switching tor speed automatically
during day period.
More information:
Im using that on my home server. I have two torrc files, one with high
RelayBandwidthRate (100kB/s) for times when Im not online (night and longer
part of day) and one with less speed around 20kB/s for times Im online and
working . I dont want to switch off tor completely, because people then
cannot connect my node and also node's uptime is low when Im switching them
on/off often ;).
Im switching configuration file in bash by calling /etc/init.d/tor reload
and it is working like a charm for me. But I know it is not the best
solution for users, because their tors expect that my node's throughput is
much more higher than it really is at the moment when Im online.
And Im asking you what happen, when this difference in speed is not 100 - 20
= 80kB/s, but for example 3000 - 100 = 2800 kB/s. I expect it will lead to
slow down clients and overload of this relay, because everybody will expect
for long time that there is much better throughput than really is. So....
1) How often tor client updates his relay database? Quick updates can
reflect these changes in topology/speeds.
2) Will it cause to any problematic behaviour or it is OK and I shouldnt
solve this?
All speeds - 3Mb/s and 100kB/s are only illustrative. Im not sure what I
will vindicate and I dont want to run Tor during day too much, because
slower internet can lead to protests agains tor installation.
PS: Hope you understood me enough, Scott :-)

Im not sure that it really helps - there are still big gaps in speeds and

But there is some mechanism around hibernation, because node is able to send
warning to directory server, that he will be hinernating in... cca 1 hour.
This is distributed to clients by classic way, so new clients know about
node's planned offline status and they dont select this node to new
circuits. I think it can be helpfull to know, how to send this signal to

using 2.1.x branch, it can be a reason...
I will try to make screenshot, but currently I have not enough traffic to
show this effect.

Tor FAQ: I have more than one CPU. Does this help?
Yes. You can set your NumCpus config option in torrc to the number of CPUs
you have, and Tor will spawn this many cpuworkers to deal with public key
operations in parallel.
nope, just one core is used by tor for aes crypto. So the "openssl speed
Are you sure?

Hi Mitar,
firstly, my linode server is hosting for my small sites, NOT for Tor
service. But because I use only about 30-40 GB per month for my sites, I
decided to give rest to Tor network. So your calculation is faulty - I pay
nothing to give 360 GB per month for Tor ;)
Although Im big Tor fan, I think it is better idea to run Tor in unused
bandwith (like me) on plenty of computers rather than pay together few big
centralized servers (like you offer). Firstly, using unused bandwidth is for
free. And it is also more secure.

@_subject: Gsoc Idea: Lunux Tor/Firefox Bundle 
full integration of Vidalia and Tor in Linux is very, very wanted.
Current status, where Vidalia controls own Tor process is not working
well for common user. Although I cannot participate on GSoC and I dont
know C++ so much, feel free to contact me with testing any changes you
will make. I have Ubuntu, Debian and Slax (Slackware) boxes and Im
ready to support any effort like this. I have also some experiences in
packaging for Debian, if it will be needed.

@_subject: Tor memory usage on embedded systems. 
Im little bit confused with RAM usage of i686 box. Im running node with
almost same bandwidth and after 6 days uptime, Tor process consumes only
37MB. What is different? My Tor version is  0.2.1.12-alpha (r18423).

@_subject: Tor memory usage on embedded systems. 
As Roger wrote to list before few months, experimental version of Tor
optimizes RAM usage and I can confirm that. Before I switched to 0.2.1.x
branch, my node used +- 2x more RAM (not sure exactly).
ad "top": Dont forget to buffers and caches. So final amount of actually
used RAM by system is:
Used - Buffers - Cached.
My experience is that blank Debian system take around 10MB RAM. Currently,
my home server running Xen dom0, xen-tools, sshd and nagios nrpe takes 47 MB
RAM. Tor process for node like yours takes around 50 MB RAM. So I think 64
RAM is enough to run Tor without problems.

@_subject: more on the Comcast 250 GB/mo. problem 
Hi Scott,
dont forget, that your's ISP last mile connectity is not sized for running
high-traffic servers. They count with aggregation, because dont expect many
users running any kind of server application. And I think there is nothing
illegal in their business. If you want to run fast server, rent a server or
ask Comcast to some business plan with less aggregation (and much much
higher price, because it is last mile connectivity).
Btw, Im also running one Tor exit on cable Internet. I have not any traffic
monitoring, but expect that Im also near to 300GB/month and Im just waiting
on first call from my ISP ;). 300GB of traffic is far over any "normal"
usage of home internet, especially in contry of former CCCP :-D:

@_subject: Abuse ticket 
Im running Tor on VPS and I have some problems with abusive Tor traffic.
Firstly, I had problem with DMCA and BitTorrents, so I close non-HTTP(s)
ports and everything was OK for few months. Now, some dumbass wrote abusive
message to some web forum, which was reported to police. They located my
server as source. Last message from VPS admin is:
I dont want to close HTTP ports 8-), but next report of abusive traffic will
lead to shutting down Tor or whole VPS :-(. So is there any "best practice",
what I should do now? DMCA response is probably not fitting to this issue...

it was not a spam in my case. See that piece of shit:
Forum admin is probably also an id*ot, because I dont know, why he blocks
subnet of 65000 IP address because of single abusive post. On other hand, I
accept my VPS's provider attitude, because it is unacceptable to leave his
IP pool in blacklists...
As I wrote many times before, running my VPS has priority No.1, but I also
like to support Tor and I will try to find any solution to keep exit node
running. If anybody have an idea, please help me!

Hello Matt,
Im interesting in your materials, because at this moment, Im working on
advocacy of Tor node on my university. So please send me a copy!
I think there are some materials about Tor advocacy, see

I obtain following message from my provider:
The following alert has been raised by the network security system for
the application/server in your network. It is suspected that some
malicious activity is happening from your network. The following IP
address is making SQL Injection to our network
Because it isnt DMCA, but hack attack, is there any "template" for response?
Message to hackers: Dont do it again, please!
(I had to say that, because it is probably the only one assistance,
which Im able to do as Tor operator ;).
