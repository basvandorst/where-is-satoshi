Really? I need to try this. I'd prefer to boot from a DVD and use an
internal hard drive or sdcard or something for persistence anyway. I
hope someone documents this :).

============================== START ==============================
With SecureDrop, the viewing station requires Tails with persistent
storage, and you can only use persistent storage if you boot off of a
USB stick. (I haven't tried it yet, but you could probably get Tails
running in a VirtualBox with persistent storage as long as you're
booting the VM off of a real physical USB stick.)
SecureDrop also depends on hidden services. To see a good overview of
how the hidden services and Tails end up working in practice, see:

I wrote Tor Browser Launcher, which is currently (very slowly) in the process of getting packaged in Debian. Before that, the way to install it now is to go to  and follow the instructions in the readme.
It works great on Ubuntu, and it keeps your Tor Browser updated, and even verifies PGP signatures of the downloads.
I haven't had time to work on it in some time, but I would like to one day make it available for Windows and OS X too. If anyone wants to volunteer :).
