@_subject: [tor-talk] BitMail.sf.net v 0.6 - Secure Encrypting Email Client 
can BitMail.sf.net as a p2p email tool for encrypted Email (and hybrid with IMAP-Email) be regarded as a reference model for research to create a secure Email Client? as it uses both, gnupg and openssl! Does anyone know, if it runs over Tor? Sincerely, Robert
