@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor-to-web gateway name registration 
Would it be possible for webmasters to register their hidden services
with gateways like onion.to or Tor2web in such a way that instead of
having to deal with addresses like salmagundi487345.onion.to, they could
receive a shorter name like mycoolblog.onion.to which would then
redirect to the longer hidden-service address?
Perhaps this has already been considered/discarded/implemented without
my realizing. It might mean a greater level of work than the gateway
operators want to take on, and many webmasters may not want to
communicate with gateways in this fashion, but it could be useful to
people who want to distribute a memorable address for their site while
retaining the benefits of a hidden service (e.g. not having to register
an actual domain name with the attendant whois woes, server location
Am I missing something? Would this violate the 'pure proxy' principle
currently claimed by these gateway services?

Nathan Suchy:
If you really want to enable it, just go to 'tools > add-ons', then
'plugins' and click 'enable' under 'shockwave flash', BUT:
This is a many-dollar question - see here

@_subject: [tor-talk] How can I get Adobe Flash working in the Tor Browser 
Nathan Suchy:
In the TBB design document
[ the project
makes the following statements:
'Plugins have the ability to make arbitrary OS system calls and bypass
proxy settings. This includes the ability to make UDP sockets and send
arbitrary data independent of the browser proxy settings.'
'Currently, we entirely disable all plugins in Tor Browser. However, as
a compromise due to the popularity of Flash, we allow users to re-enable
Flash, and flash objects are blocked behind a click-to-play barrier that
is available only after the user has specifically enabled plugins.'
So on this basis I think the answer to your question is 'yes, Flash will
go through Tor, unless anybody tries anything with you'. You will be
secure absent an attacker, as they say.

Tor Weekly News                                      December 18th, 2013
Welcome to the twenty-fifth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the ever-updating Tor
Tor 0.2.4.19 is out
Tails saw its 35th release on December 11th [4]. It incorporates many
major and minor improvements and bugfixes, and opens up the new
incremental-upgrade feature for beta-testing.
As this is the first release to feature a browser based on the Firefox
24 ESR series, some small inconveniences found their way in. Have a look
at the known issues before giving it a go.
Nevertheless, it fixes several important security issues [5], so it is
recommended that all users upgrade as soon as possible.
   [4]    [5] Torservers.net awarded $250,000 grant
The Tails team reported on the vast amount of activity that occurred
during November 2013 [12]. Coming up in the next few Tails releases are
an updated I2P, a new clock applet with configurable timezone, better
localization, incremental upgrades, safer persistence, MAC spoofing?
  [12] meejah announced the release of txtorcon 0.8.2, and warned users that
they should upgrade if they use that program?s TCP4HiddenServiceEndpoint
feature, in order to fix a bug that allows listening on hosts other than
127.0.0.1 [13].
  [13] Kevin P Dyer announced the 0.2.2 release of fteproxy, which ?includes
the removal of gmpy as a dependency, additional documentation to explain
the significance of language theoretical algorithms, and bounds checking
of the input/output of our (un)ranking algorithms? [14]; this hot on the
heels of 0.2.1, in which he ?focused on breaking away from heavyweight
dependencies: OpenFST and boost? [15].
  [14]   [15] Mike Perry shared his thoughts regarding the presence of the Tor Browser
Bundle in centralized repositories such as the Apple App Store or Google
Play, and the possibilities for attack that these stores open up [16].
  [16] Ondrej Mikle warned users of Enterprise Linux 5 that Tor RPM packages
will no longer be built for their platform, owing to an ?increasing
number of required workarounds? [17].
  [17] Karsten Loesing published a summary of the past, present and the future
of the Tor Metrics project, which he maintains, offering some context
for the various changes that have recently been announced [18].
  [18] Lunar sent reports from the Tor help desk for October [19] and
November [20].
  [19]   [20] Jacob Appelbaum recapped his work over the last few months ? from June
to December ? in a slew of reports [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].

Welcome to the fourteenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the much-discussed Tor
Tor Browser Bundle 3.0alpha4 released
Multiple users wrote to the help desk asking for guidance setting up
hidden service sites. The most straightforward documentation for hidden
services is in the torrc file itself [14]. A more in-depth guide can be
found on the Tor Project website [15]. The website also documents how
hidden services work [16]. Technical details can be found in the
Rendezvous Specification document [17].
  [14]   [15]   [16]   [17] Monthly status reports for September 2013
Mike Perry published his new GPG public key, adding: ?this new key will
be used to sign email from me going forward, and will be used to sign
software releases until such time as I get around to creating a second
set of keys on a hardware token for that purpose? [23].
  [23] David Fifield updated the Pluggable Transports bundles using the latest
Tor Browser Bundle [24]. In order to benefit from the improvements and
security fixes, please update!
  [24] intrigeri sent a release schedule for Tails 0.21 [25]. The first release
candidate should be out on October 20th.
  [25] Roger Dingledine sent out ?a list of criteria to consider when
evaluating pluggable transports for readiness of deployment to users?,
asking for comments on his initial draft [26].
  [26] If you have the necessary hardware and want to help Tails out, please
test two upcoming features: persistent printer settings [27] and support
for more SD card readers (the ?sdio? type) [28].

@_subject: [tor-talk] What if I connect to all nsa Tor nodes? 
Nathan Suchy:
The answer is the same as when you asked 'how private is Tor' - what
does 'secure' mean?
The attacker would be able to identify your location and destination in
all circumstances. If you were browsing over https, they would have no
more access to the content of your traffic than if you were connecting
directly to the secure website (unless they separately found a way
around that as well).
If you were not using https, the content of your transactions would be
readable and modifiable by the attacker (as it normally is by any exit
node operator in that situation).
So if you were browsing over https (and heeded any certificate
warnings), and you were concerned only about the content of your
communications, then being attacked by all three nodes would not change
your level of security. If your definition of security includes not
having your machine associated with a list of destinations on the
internet by an observer then in this case, even with https, your traffic
would no longer be secure.
Somebody correct me if I'm wrong.

Is the window size that Tor Browser uses when you first open it to be
taken therefore as some kind of default, not to be changed, or can you
resize the window as much as you like, as long as you don't maximize it?
This would be quite useful information for users with small screens.

Equally, 'if you maximize your browser (or your browser maximizes
itself automatically, as Tor Browser does when I click 'New Identity),
and your screen is some weird size, all of your activity is highly
linkable to advertisers until you get a new screen'?
Also, 'if you want to do something unlinkable, pick a weird screen
size and then change it after you finish doing it?'
I get that this is difficult to avoid. Just trying to clarify.

I just deleted the existing directory and re-downloaded the bundle
(3.0alpha3 on Ubuntu 13.04). My monitor resolution is apparently
1024x600 (I hope that's the one you meant).
On first opening the program, the window is maximized. If I
un-maximize it to a random-ish size, browse around for a bit, and then
request a new identity, the new browser window opens maximized.
EFF's 'Panopticlick' and JonDoNym's 'ip-check.org' both claim
different sizes for my screen. I'm not sure what that means - let me
know if there's something I'm not telling you.

Mike Perry:
I think I once again have Ubuntu Unity to thank. All evidence suggests
that windows which try to open at 75% of screen size or over are
automatically maximized (it used to be 60%!), and since my computer
screen is quite small I assume this is what Tor Browser is trying to
do. Apparently you can alter this by changing some experimental
setting in the bowels of compiz, but really this is just another
incentive to start using some other desktop.
It strikes me that if the window size is really the only variable
piece of information that Tor Browser exposes to the internet at
large, it isn't a good idea to leave hapless Ubuntu users with small
computers to fend for themselves (i.e. learn how to install another
desktop environment). Until there's progress on  do you think
there should be at least a verbal warning about this somewhere?

Coda: I've altered the 'automaximize value' in
compizconfig-settings-manager to 100% and Tor Browser now behaves
itself in Unity. I've opened  as I think this is sufficiently
different from the more general concern reported in  that it
needs its own mention, but feel free to close it if you disagree.
GNOME's windows have such colossal title bars that I can't actually
tell whether or not it's opening at the right size; it just fills my
screen anyway.

Official response to QUICK ANT disclosure
?Back in the ancient pre-Tor days, at the height of the crypto wars,
Ian Goldberg asked me at Financial Crypto in 1998 why we created onion
routing. Not entirely facetiously I told him that the fascinating
technological problems and the potential to better protect people and

context where people who were sure they should hate each other were
forced to collaborate.? [13]

  [18] Brian Callahan alerted relay operators running FreeBSD and OpenBSD to
the release of ports updated to the new tor 0.2.4.17-rc [19].
Christian Sturm then promptly announced the release of updated packages
for NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, illumos, Minix, and ?other systems
potentially using pkgsrc? [20].
  [19]   [20] Karsten Loesing updated tor?s GeoIP database to the newest version [21].
Karsten also published the results of his memory usage test on a version
of tor that reports additional statistics, which he conducted using the
Shadow network simulator [22].
Finally, Karsten asked for comments on his proposal to retire the old
method of estimating user numbers on the metrics page over the next few
weeks in favor of a more reliable, more efficient system (which has been
in beta for some time already), and with it to remove the accumulated
data associated with the older method [23].
  [21]   [22]   [23] Fabio Pietrosanti announced that the available cipher suites for
connections to tor2web.org have been updated to a much stronger
set [24].
  [24] Robert published the results of an investigation into different kinds of
round-trip time (RTT) measurement, and their efficiency in building
circuits through the Tor network [25].
  [25] George Kadianakis asked for comments on his early draft of a proposal
for different methods of migrating the Hidden Service protocol to a more
secure version [26].
George also pushed new versions of obfsproxy (0.2.3) and pyptlib
(0.0.4) [27].
  [26]   [27] In the course of a thread about the size of browser windows posing a
fingerprinting threat [28], harmony discovered that users of Ubuntu?s
Unity desktop should disable the ?automaximize? behavior, as it can
override one of Tor Browser?s anti-fingerprinting measures [29].

@_subject: [tor-talk] Debian/GNOME 3.0alpha automaximize problem 
Having previously reported a problem with Tor browser automaximizing
itself on my small Ubuntu Unity screen [bugs.torproject.org/9738], I
decided my life was too easy and switched my OS to Debian with GNOME 3.
In case you aren't aware, this is a problem because
I've tried three versions of TBB on this system - stable, alpha, and
3.0alpha. The first two behaved normally, opening their windows at what
looks like a multiple of 200x100. 3.0alpha, however, opens automaximized
every time.
The fix in Unity was to use compizconfig-settings-manager's 'Unity
Plugin' to set the 'automaximize' threshold to 100, but that doesn't
work in Debian because compizconfig-settings-manager is nowhere to be
found in apt-get. I've tried all the fixes suggested at
 to
no avail. Can anyone tell me what is going on?
Like I say, this appears only to be an issue with 3.0alpha.

Welcome to the fourteenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
The Heartbleed Bug and Tor
Users the world over are increasingly aware of Tor?s leading reputation
as a well-researched and -developed censorship circumvention tool ? and,
regrettably, so are censorship authorities. Events such as last month?s
(short-lived) disruption of access to the main Tor Project website from
some Turkish internet connections [10] have reaffirmed the need for
multiple distribution channels that users can turn to during a
censorship event in order to acquire a copy of the Tor Browser, secure
their browsing, and beat the censors. One of the simplest ways of
ensuring this is to make a copy of the entire website and put it
somewhere else.
Recent days have seen the establishment of a large number of new Tor
website mirrors, for which thanks must go to Max Jakob Maass [11], Ahmad
Zoughbi [12], Darren Meyer [13], Piratenpartei Bayern [14], Bernd
Fix [15], Florian Walther [16], the Electronic Frontier Foundation (on a
subdomain formerly housing the Tor Project?s official site) [17], the
Freedom of the Press Foundation [18], Caleb Xu [19], George
Kargiotakis [20], and Tobias Markus [21], as well as to all the mirror
operators of longer standing [22].
If you?d like to participate in the effort to render blocking of the Tor
website even more futile, please see the instructions for running a
mirror [23], and then come to the tor-mirrors mailing list [24] to
notify the community!

David Goulet announced [34] the seventh release candidate for Torsocks

applications with Tor. ?Nothing major, fixes and some code refactoring
went in?, said David. Please review, test, and report any issues you
 [34]:  [35]: Nathan Freitas posted [36] a brief analysis of the role played by Orbot
in the recent Turkish internet service disruption: ?it might be good to
think about Turkey?s Twitter block as a ?censorship-lite? event, not
unlike the UK or Indonesia, and then figure out how we can encourage
more adoption.?
 [36]: Jann Horn drew attention [37] to a potential issue caused by some Tor
relays sending out globally-sequential IP IDs. Roger Dingledine
linked [38] to an academic paper connected with the same question, while
Daniel Bilik suggested [39] one method of preventing this from happening
on FreeBSD. Exactly how significant this issue is (or is not) for the
Tor network is very much an open question; further research into which
operating systems it affects, and how it might be related to known
attacks against anonymity, would be very welcome.
 [37]:  [38]:  [39]: As part of their current campaign [40] to fund usable encryption tools
(including Tor) for journalists, the Freedom of the Press Foundation
published [41] a blog post on the ?little-known? Tails operating system,
featuring quotes from three of the journalists most prominently
associated with the recent Snowden disclosures (Laura Poitras, Glenn
Greenwald, and Barton Gellman) attesting to the important role Tails has
played in their ability to carry out their work. If you?re impressed by
what you read, please donate to the campaign ? or become a Tails
contributor [42]!
 [40]:  [41]:  [42]: Two Tor-affiliated projects ? the Open Observatory of Network
Interference and Tails ? have each submitted a proposal to this year?s
Knight News Challenge [43]. The OONI proposal [44] involves further
developing the ooni-probe software suite and deploying it in countries
around the world, as well as working on analysis and visualization of
the data gathered, in collaboration with the Chokepoint Project [45];
while Tails? submission [46] proposes to ?improve Tails to limit the
impact of security flaws, isolate critical applications, and provide
same-day security updates?. Voting is limited to the Knight Foundation?s
trustees, but feel free to read each submission and leave your comments
for the developers.
 [43]:  [44]:  [45]:  [46]: Robert posted [47] a short proposal for ?a prototype of a
next-generation Tor control interface, aiming to combine the strengths
of both the present control protocol and the state-of-the-art
libraries?. The idea was originally destined for this year?s GSoC
season, but in the end Robert opted instead to ?get some feedback and
let the idea evolve.?
 [47]: After the end of the Tails logo contest [48] last week, sajolida
announced [49] that the winner will be declared by April 9th, after a
week of voting by the most active Tails contributors.

Tor?s StackExchange did its second site self-evaluation [56]. Users were
asked to review ten questions and their respective answers. This should
help to improve the site's overall quality.
The question ?Why does GnuPG show the signature of Erinn Clark as not
trusted?? [57] got the best rating. When a user verified the downloaded
copy of Tor Browser Bundle, GnuPG showed Erinn?s signature as
not-trusted. Jens Kubieziel explained the trust model of GnuPG in his
answer, and gapz referred to the handbook [58].
The following questions need better answers: ?How to validate
certificates?? [59]; ?Why does Atlas sometimes show a different IP
address from  [60]; ?Site login does not
persist? [61]; and ?My Atlas page is blank? [62].
If you know good answers to these questions, please help the users of

Cutting out relays running version 0.2.2.x
Nathan Freitas announced [7] the third (and probably final) release
candidate for Orbot 13.0.6: ?The big improvements in this build are a

improvements to the transparent proxying iptables scripts?.

The Tails developers put out two calls for testing: the first [8] is for
the first release candidate of Tails 1.0; while the second [9] is for

Welcome to the sixteenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
Cutting out relays running version 0.2.2.x
Nathan Freitas announced [7] the third (and probably final) release
candidate for Orbot 13.0.6: ?The big improvements in this build are a
fix for the disconnected UI/activity (Tor is on, but UI shows off), and
improvements to the transparent proxying iptables scripts?.
  [7]: The Tails developers put out two calls for testing: the first [8] is for
the first release candidate of Tails 1.0; while the second [9] is for
UEFI support, which ?allows you to start Tails using a USB stick on
recent hardware, and especially on Mac?. ?Test wildly?, and report any
bugs you find!
  [8]:   [9]: Andrea Shepard sent [10] a list of 1777 fingerprints for relays ?which
have ever turned up as potentially exposed by Heartbleed?. It appears
that enough directory authority operators now reject relays known to be
problematic [11]: sssheep reported [12] that the still-vulnerable
section of the network was down to 0.01% of the consensus weight.

Welcome to the thirty-third issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the community around Tor,
Aphex Twin?s favorite anonymity network [1].
   [1]: Tor Browser 3.6.4 and 4.0-alpha-1 are out
meejah announced [16] the release of version 0.11.0 of txtorcon, a
Twisted-based Python controller library for Tor. This release brings
several API improvements; see meejah?s message for full release notes
and instructions on how to download it.
  [16]: Mike Perry posted an overview [17] of a recent report put together by
iSEC Partners and commissioned by the Open Technology Fund to explore
?current and future hardening options for the Tor Browser?. Among other
things, Mike?s post addresses the report?s immediate hardening
recommendations, latest thoughts on the proposed Tor Browser ?security
slider?, and longer-term security development measures, as well as ways
in which the development of Google Chrome could inform Tor Browser?s own
security engineering.
  [17]: Nick Mathewson asked for comments [18] on Trunnel, ?a little tool to
automatically generate binary encoding and parsing code based on C-like
structure descriptions? intended to prevent ?Heartbleed?-style
vulnerabilities from creeping into Tor?s binary-parsing code in C. ?My
open questions are: Is this a good idea? Is it a good idea to use this
in Tor? Are there any tricky bugs left in the generated code? What am I
forgetting to think of??, wrote Nick.
  [18]: George Kadianakis followed up his journey to the core [19] of what Tor
does when trying to connect to entry guards in the absence of a network
connection with another post [20] running through some possible
improvements to Tor?s behavior in these situations: ?I?m looking forward
to some feedback on the proposed algorithms as well as improvements and
  [19]:   [20]: Arturo Filast? requested feedback [21] on some proposed changes to the
format of the ?test deck? used by ooni-probe, the main project of the
Open Observatory of Network Interference. ?A test deck is basically a
way of telling it ?Run this list of OONI tests with these inputs and by
the way be sure you also set these options properly when doing so??This
new format is supposed to overcome some of the limitations of the old
design and we hope that a major redesign will not be needed in the near
future?, wrote Arturo.
  [21]: Tor?s importance to users who are at risk, for a variety of reasons,
makes it an attractive target for creators of malware, who distribute
fake or modified versions of Tor software for malicious purposes.
Following a recent report of a fake Tor Browser in circulation, Julien
Voisin carried out an investigation of the compromised software, and
posted a detailed analysis [22] of the results. To ensure you are
protected against this sort of attack, make sure you verify any Tor
software you download [23] before running it!
  [22]:   [23]: Arlo Breault submitted a status report for July [24].
  [24]: As the annual Google Summer of Code season draws to a close, Tor?s GSoC
students are submitting their final reports. Israel Leiva reported on
the revamp of GetTor [25], Marc Juarez on the framework for website
fingerprinting countermeasures [26], Juha Nurmi on ahmia.fi [27], Noah
Rahman on Stegotorus enhancement [28], Amogh Pradeep on
Orbot+Orfox [29], Daniel Mart? on consensus diffs [30], Mikhail Belous

Welcome to the thirty-fourth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the
weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
Orfox: a new Firefox-based secure browser for Android
A new release of ooniprobe, the network interference data collector for
OONI [7], was announced [8] by Arturo Filast?. Version 1.1.0 introduces
a new command line tool ?for listing the reports that have not been
published to a collector and that allows the probe operator to choose
which ones they would like to upload?. The new version also improve the
privacy of the reports by sanitizing file paths.
  [7]:   [8]: Developers of applications using Onionoo [9] ? the web service to learn
about currently running Tor relays and bridges ? are invited to join the
new onionoo-announce mailing list [10]. Keeping the list low volume,
Karsten Loesing plans on using it to announce major protocol changes,
scheduled maintenance, major bug fixes, and other important news.
  [9]:  [10]: Yawning Angel has made available [11] an experimental version of the Tor
Browser that includes the latest version of the obfs4 [12] pluggable
transport.  Testing on Windows and OS X would be particularly welcome.  [11]:  [12]: Fabian Keil reported [13] that FreeBSD now includes ports of liballium
and obfsclient.
 [13]: JusticeRage explained [14] how relay operators who offer exiting on port
25 can protect the reputation of their domain name by using the Sender
Policy Framework.
 [14]: Sreenatha Bhatlapenumarthi sent the final GSoC report [15] for the Tor
Weather rewrite project. Juha Nurmi sent another report [16] on the
development of ahmia.fi.

GetTor is back
Nathan Freitas announced [21] version 14.1.4 of Orbot, the Tor client
for Android, which brings with it further improvements to background
service operation, as well as theme and layout tweaks.
 [21]: After much back-and-forth, work by Andrea Shepard to make Tor?s cell
scheduling mechanism more efficient was finally merged [22]. Although
performance is not yet affected, these changes could form the basis of
other improvements to managing congestion caused by ?mismanaged socket
output? in the Tor network, as discussed by Jansen et al. in ?Never Been
KIST? [23].
 [22]:  [23]: Following a discussion with David Goulet, Nick Mathewson posted a draft
proposal [24] of possible improvements to integration testing for Tor.
 [24]: Sebastian Hahn informed [25] users of the Tor Project?s git repositories
that cloning via the unauthenticated git:// protocol is no longer
supported ? secure https:// access has been and still is the preferred
method for retrieving code.
 [25]: Gareth Owen started a discussion [26] of suspicious relay behaviors that
automated Tor network tests could scan for, in addition to those that

Welcome to the forty-ninth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
Tor Browser 4.0.2 and 4.5-alpha-2 are out
The Tails team announced [4] a new version of the amnesic live operating
system. Alongside updates to Linux and Tor Browser, Tails 1.2.1 finally
disables the Truecrypt encryption manager, which was abandoned by its
developers earlier this year. There have been warnings about this change
for several months, but users who have not yet migrated their data away
from Truecrypt (or who are not able to) can still access these volumes
with cryptsetup by following Tails? own guide [5].
The default configuration of GnuPG has also been changed in line with
accepted best practices [6]. If you want to take advantage of this,
there is a simple step you need to perform; please see the team?s post
for more details, and get your copy of the new Tails from the download
page [7] or through the incremental updater.
  [4]:   [5]:   [6]:   [7]: More monthly status reports for November 2014
George Kadianakis sent out [17] an updated draft of the proposal to
safely collect hidden service statistics from Tor relays.
 [17]: Nick Mathewson gave a talk [18] to the Computer Systems Security class
at MIT on the subject of ?Anonymous Communication?.
 [18]: David Fifield summarized [19] the costs incurred in November by the
infrastructure for the meek pluggable transport.
 [19]: The Tails team wondered [20] about the best way to prioritize adding
support for pluggable transports: ?Assuming we add support for
Scramblesuit in Tails 1.3, then what usecases won?t we be supporting,
that we could support better with obfs4 or meek??
 [20]: usprey wrote up a guide [21] to configuring a Tor relay on a server
running Arch Linux: ?All and any feedback will be appreciated! Are there
any privacy concerns about using pdnsd to cache DNS locally??
 [21]: Jacob Appelbaum recommended [22] possible ways to reduce the attack
surface presented by the kernel and the firewall in Tails. He also
compiled [23] a dataset containing historical hashes and signatures of
Tails files: ?In the future, I?ll write a program that uses the dataset
in a useful manner. In an ideal world, we?d have a way to use a Tails
disk to verify any other Tails disk.?
 [22]:  [23]: Tor help desk roundup
strand raised a question about the code regarding rendezvous and
introduction points [30]. Within src/or/rendservice.c there are several
occurrences of onion_address, and strand wants to know which function
catches what from a hidden service. If you can answer this question,
please come to Tor?s Q&A page and give us some insights.

Welcome to the fiftieth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
Solidarity against online harassment
The Tails team announced [2] a pointfix release of the amnesic live
operating system. The only difference between this version and the
recent 1.2.1 release is that the automatic Tails Updater now expects a
different certificate authority when checking for a new Tails version.
As the team explained, ?On January 3rd, the SSL certificate of our
website hosting provider, boum.org, will expire. The new certificate
will be issued by a different certificate authority [?] As a
consequence, versions previous to 1.2.2 won?t be able to do the next
automatic upgrade to version 1.2.3 and will receive an error message
from Tails Upgrader when starting Tails after January 3rd?.
This, along with a bug [3] that prevents automatic updates from 1.2.1 to
1.2.2, means that all Tails users will need to upgrade manually: either
to version 1.2.2 before January 3rd or (if for some reason that is not
possible) to version 1.2.3 following its release on January 14th.
Please see the team?s post for more details and download instructions.
  [2]:   [3]: Miscellaneous news
Because Tor Browser prevents users from running it as root, Kali Linux
users starting Tor Browser will see an error message saying Tor should
not be run as root. In Kali, all userspace software runs as root by default. To run Tor
Browser in Kali Linux, create a new user account just for using Tor
Browser. Unpack Tor Browser and chown -R your whole Tor Browser
directory. Run Tor Browser as your created Tor Browser user account.

Stem 1.3 is out
The team of researchers working on the collection of hidden service
statistics [4] asked relay operators for help by enabling these
statistics on their relays in the coming days and weeks. They included a
step-by-step tutorial [5] for enabling this feature, which has recently
been merged into Tor?s main branch.
  [4]:   [5]: Building on Andrea Shepard?s recently-merged work on global cell
scheduling [6], Nick Mathewson announced [7] that the KIST socket
management algorithm proposed earlier this year [8] to reduce congestion
in the Tor network is now ?somewhat implemented? for Linux.  You can
follow the testing and reviews on the associated ticket [9].
  [6]:   [7]:   [8]:   [9]: Nick also asked for feedback [10] on the proposal to increase the
interval at which Tor relays report their bandwidth usage statistics
from fifteen minutes to four hours [11]: ?Will this break anything you
know about??
 [10]:  [11]: Moritz Bartl invited [12] Tor relay operators to a meet-up [13] at the
upcoming Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg: ?We will do quick
presentations on recent and future activities around Torservers.net,
talk about events relevant to the Tor relay community, and what lies

Welcome to the final issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
Attacks and rumors of attacks
Lasse ?verlier discovered that ScrambleSuit?s [10] protection against
?replay attacks?, in which an adversary repeats a client authentication
event to learn that the server is in fact a ScrambleSuit bridge, doesn?t
work. Philipp Winter explained [11] the issue, and suggested some simple
 [10]:  [11]: Tom van der Woerdt asked for review [12] of a patch [13] to remove the
obsolete version 1 of Tor?s link protocol from the current software:
?It?s a rather large patch, though not as large as the patch that will
remove v2 of the protocol. However, before I write that one, can someone
please check whether my patch is sane and I?m not violating any
standards or policies??
 [12]:  [13]: David Fifield trimmed [14] the length of meek?s [15] HTTP headers from
413 to 162 bytes, reducing the bandwidth it uses by ?approximately? 3%.

Tor Weekly News                                      February 19th, 2014
Welcome to the seventh issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the inked [1] Tor community.
   [1]: Tor 0.2.5.2-alpha is out
The Tails team has published [9] its report for January 2014. A lot is
happening in the growing community of Tails developers. Have a look!
   [9]: Qingping Hou sent out the beginnings of a proposal to increase the speed
of connections to Tor Hidden Services by using circuits of only five
hops, and asked the community for feedback [10].
  [10]: Yawning Angel called for help with testing obfsclient, a C++ pluggable
transport client, and clarified the next steps in the development
process [11].
  [11]: David Fifield made available a second updated set of the experimental
Tor Pluggable Transport Bundle with tor-fw-helper, which fixes several
of the errors encountered in the first version. [12].
  [12]: Nick Mathewson called for help with reviewing proposal 227, which
involves ?extending the Tor consensus document to include digests of the
latest versions of one or more package files, to allow software using
Tor to determine its up-to-dateness, and help users verify that they are
getting the correct software? [13].
  [13]: Efforts to include the FTE protocol in the Tor Pluggable Transport
Bundles have taken a step forward, as Kevin P. Dyer announced [14] the
release of a patch including fteproxy that not only works, but also
builds deterministically, in keeping with the Tor Project?s focus on
build security [15].
  [14]:   [15]: Rusty Bird announced [16] the release of corridor [17], a Tor traffic
whitelisting gateway. corridor will turn a Linux system into a router
that ?allows only connections to Tor relays to pass through (no clearnet
leaks!)?. However, unlike transparent proxying solutions, ?client
computers are themselves responsible for torifying their own traffic.?
  [16]:   [17]: One relay operator was looking for an init.d script able to start
multiple tor instances. Johannes F?rmann pointed out [18] that one was
available in the torservers.net Git repository [19].
  [18]:   [19]: TorBirdy, the Tor-enabling extension for the Thunderbird mail client,
currently disables the automated account configuration system for
security reasons. Progress is being made [20] in changing the behavior
to make it fit the expectations of Tor users.
  [20]: Andrea Shepard submitted seven status reports, covering her activity
since July 2013 [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].

Welcome to the twenty-third issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
Tor Browser 3.6.2 is out
Following April?s much-loved ?Heartbleed? bug, another OpenSSL
vulnerability was discovered ? nicknamed ?EarlyCCS? [7] ? that could
have an impact on the security of many internet services, including Tor.
Nick Mathewson explained [8] that although ?Tor is comparatively
resilient to having one layer of crypto removed?, it may be affected to
the extent that ?an adversary in the position to run a MITM attack on a
Tor client or relay could cause a TLS connection to be negotiated
without real encryption or authentication.?
Tor users and relay operators should make sure to update their OpenSSL
and Tor packages as soon as possible; those using a system tor (rather
than or in addition to the Tor Browser) should ensure that they restart
it once the updates are installed; otherwise they will not take effect.
  [7]:   [8]: A new website for the directory archive
The Tails developers formally announced [22] the upcoming Tails
Hackfest, inviting absolutely ?anyone interested in making Tails more
usable and more secure? to join them in Paris on the 5th and 6th of July
(immediately after the Tor dev meeting) and ?learn about the challenges
faced by Tails, and how you can be part of the solution?. Fuller details
of the venue and timetable can be found on the Tails website [23].

Noah Rahman on the Stegotorus refactoring work [29], Sreenatha

situation of Mac OS X users who would like to run Tor relays, and what
steps should be taken to make it easier for them to do so ?now that the
Vidalia bundles are deprecated and hard to find?.
 [34]: Isis Lovecruft has deployed BridgeDB version 0.2.2 [35] which contains
many fixes and translation updates. The email autoresponder should not
reply with empty emails any more.
 [35]: Damian Johnson has written up [36] several ideas regarding a possible
rewrite of the ExoneraTor service [37] in Python.
 [36]:  [37]: HTTPS is sometimes heavily throttled by censors, making it hard to
download the Tor Browser over an HTTPS link. Israel Leiva is asking for
feedback [38] about making the GetTor email service reply with links to
unencrypted HTTP servers as a work-around.

Tor Weekly News                                         March 26th, 2014
Welcome to the twelfth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
Tor 0.2.5.3-alpha is out
?but many Tails users are already running it. Now that incremental
upgrades have been turned on by default with the previous release, users
of Tails on USB sticks have been able to enjoy the process of a smooth
upgrade in three clicks.
As always, the new release [3] fixes several security holes [4]. That
alone should make anyone switch, but the new version finally brings with
it two long-awaited features and many small improvements.
Tails will now do ?MAC spoofing? by default. To hide the hardware
address used on the local network, Tails will now use a randomized
address by default. This will help prevent the tracking of one?s
geographical location across networks. For more information about MAC
spoofing, why it matters, and when it might be relevant to turn it off,
be sure to read the very well-written documentation [5].
Another important feature is the integrated support for proxies and Tor
bridges. This should be of immense help to users of Tails on censored
networks. The integration is done using the Tor Launcher extension [6],
familiar to everyone who has used recent versions of the Tor Browser.
For examples of smaller features and bugfixes: Tor, obfsproxy, I2P,
Pidgin and the web browser have been upgraded, a 64-bit kernel is used
on most systems to pave the way for UEFI support, documentation is now
accessible from the greeter, and the ?New identity? option in the
browser is available again.
The next Tails release is scheduled for April 29th and will be 1.0.  For
this important milestone in 5 years of intense work, the Tails team is
still looking for a logo [7].
  [3]:   [4]:   [5]:   [6]:   [7]: New Tor Browser releases
Since the 3.5 release, ?Tor Browser Bundle is more like a standalone
browser and less like a bundle?. This led the Tor Browser team to plan
to ?rename it to just ?Tor Browser? everywhere? [15].
 [15]: Thanks to Berkay [16] and to Andr? Schulz [17] for running mirrors of
the Tor Project website!
 [16]:  [17]: Alex reported [18] an ?important case about Tor relay operators? which
came to court in Athens, Greece on March 18th. The defendant, a Tor
relay operator, was acquitted after proving that the IP address used for
criminal activity was in fact a Tor relay.
 [18]: Connections to Twitter from inside Turkey were blocked by the Turkish
government on 20th March [19], leading to an increase in the number of
Tor users there [20, 21].
 [19]:  [20]:  [21]: Jacob Appelbaum presented a keynote titled ?Free software for freedom,
surveillance and you? at LibrePlanet 2014 [22]. The presentation was
done remotely from Berlin using Tor and GStreamer [23].
 [22]:  [23]: James Valleroy wrote to tor-relays [24] asking the best way to configure
the FreedomBox [25] as a Tor bridge. Lance Hathaway explained [26] about
pluggable transports and Roger Dingledine mentioned [27] the potential
issues of relaying a bridge and a hidden service at the same time.
 [24]:  [25]:  [26]:  [27]: Aymeric Vitte wrote to tor-talk [28] to mention an implementation of the
Tor protocol in JavaScript. Sadly, the project is not free software yet.
 [28]: A Tor exit operator recently held [29] an Ask Me Anything on Reddit,
which was quite successful, generating over 800 upvotes, 478 comments,
and being read by thousands. The most popular questions were focused on
how to improve the use of Tor, the legality of exit nodes, discussions
on hidden services, the workings of Tor, and many other topics related
to privacy and security.
 [29]: Tor help desk roundup
uighur1984 wanted to set up a hidden service for their public-facing
website [32] and decided that the HiddenServiceDir should be the same
like the DocumentRoot of the website. This led to some problems with
access rights. Sam Whited clarified that both directories should be
separated: the data in the HiddenServiceDir doesn't contain any actual
data from the website, but only the keys and other information from the
hidden service.
 [32]: Gondalse shot a video showing policemen torturing a citizen. The release
of the video led to a trial, and Gondalse fears that someone might try
to track the owner of the video down [33]. Jens Kubieziel pointed out
some OPSEC rules, and showed which problems can lead to deanonymization.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Project and Youtube is blocked in Turkey too 
Might be worth spreading some mirrors around (on that Twitter website
that no one can get to)? Last week, for example, there was a new one set
up in Turkey: I don't know if the government is ready to block Tor relays just yet.
It'll probably all go away next week once Erdo?an and his motley band
have safely won the election.
Otherwise, I suppose the Tor help desk will be getting a lot more emails
in Turkish.

I spent a long time trying to get "Tor and HTTPS" to display properly
RTL and LTR in the .po, in the end the plus sign seemed like an
honourable surrender.
It all looks great to me, but other Arabic speakers may have comments.
Thanks for taking the time to fix it up!

Hmm, to my mind it is less readable at that size than the first
version, and these images seem to have trouble with some ligatures
like lam-mim in the middle of the first part of the word for
'password' (the word for 'connection' also looks weird for some less
obvious reason).
I'm afraid I don't know what to suggest. Possibly SIL's Lateef [1] or
Scheherazade [2] would work better? On the other hand, it may not be a
problem with the font. If you'd rather not spend any more time on it
then let me know and I'll try to get my head around it.

The interactive SVG is also now broken for me in Tor Browser (the Arabic
letters do not connect up). In Firefox it looks fine, and the font is
not affected by the same ligature problems as the PNG images; could
still do with being a bit larger though, if it'll fit.

=?utf-8?q?ation_of_information_leaks?=
The words I pointed out are still messed-up in the PNGs, but other
than that everything looks fine as you say.
To be honest, 'ISP' in Roman script is probably attaining the kind of
currency that 'WiFi' enjoys. What I wrote is the full 'Internet
Service Provider'.
Likewise, for NSA I put 'National Security Agency' as I thought the
full words were more likely to have the desired effect in places where
'NSA' doesn't mean much. One could do as Rejo Zenger has and substitute
the name of the local agency, but that's less easy for a regional
language like Arabic, and most versions (inc. Chinese) have stuck with
NSA. (You might also argue that the NSA is a more pressing concern for
many Arabic monoglots.)
So the English acronyms 'ISP' and 'NSA' might be better than my
translated versions.

?????? ????? ???
Now that I look again, I think that's just the style of the font
coupled with the smallness of the image (and my bad eyes), rather than
a problem with the rendering. Thanks for fixing it.

Welcome to the forty-fourth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
Tor 0.2.6.1-alpha is out
Mike Perry announced [3] a bugfix release by the Tor Browser team.  This
version disables DirectShow [4], which was causing the Windows build of
Tor Browser to crash when visiting many websites [5]. This is not a
security release, but Windows users who have experienced this issue
should upgrade.
Please see Mike?s post for the changelog, and download your copy from
the project page [6].

Tor Weekly News                                      November 12th, 2014
Welcome to the forty-fifth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
Mozilla announces Polaris Privacy Initiative
An international coalition of law enforcement authorities announced [2]
the seizure of over 400 Tor hidden services allegedly engaging in
illegal activity. Once the desired headlines had been written, something
approaching the facts began to emerge, with the claimed number of seized
services dropping sharply to 27 [3]; more troublingly, several
high-capacity Tor relays with no apparent connection to the hidden
services were also seized [4, 5].  However, in contrast to the last
major takedown of hidden services [6], which involved one shared hidden
service hosting platform, there was no obvious single feature linking
all of the seized sites, leading to concern in the Tor community that an
exploit against the Tor network may have been responsible for their
It could be that these services were deanonymized individually over a
period of months using a variety of means, then all seized at once for
maximum effect: as Andrew Lewman and others wrote in a response posted
to the Tor blog [7], these methods could include operational security
mistakes by service operators, exploitation of flaws in poorly-written
website code, or attacks on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency that is widely
used on hidden service marketplaces. On the other hand, if an attack on
the Tor network itself is at play, it may be a variant of the class of
attack known as ?traffic confirmation?, like the one observed earlier
this year [8]. ?Unfortunately,? as the blog post notes, ?the authorities
did not specify how they managed to locate the hidden services?; even if
they had, recent disclosures concerning ?parallel construction? in law
enforcement [9] mean that the public would not necessarily be able to
trust their explanation.
?Hidden services need some love? has become a familiar refrain in recent
months, and even though the story behind these seizures may remain
unknown, they have reinvigorated some long-running threads on
improvements to the security of this important technology. George
Kadianakis coded [10] a patch that allows hidden service operators to
?specify a set of nodes that will be pinned as middle nodes in hidden
service rendezvous circuits?, while the theory behind this continues to
be discussed [11], as does the hidden service authorization feature [12]
and how widely it is used in practice [13].
?The attention hidden services have received is minimal compared to
their social value and compared to the size and determination of their
adversaries.? If you are a hidden service operator concerned by these
seizures, or you want to help ensure the possibility of free and
uncensorable publishing online, see the group blog post for more
details, and feel free to join in with the discussions on the tor-dev
mailing list.

Welcome to the forty-sixth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
Tor Browser 4.5-alpha-1 is out
Roger Dingledine [6] and Sambuddho Chakravarty [7] responded on the Tor
blog to inaccurate reports of a new attack against Tor, based on a
recent study co-authored by Sambuddho. ?It?s great to see more research
on traffic correlation attacks, especially on attacks that don?t need to
see the whole flow on each side. But it?s also important to realize that
traffic correlation attacks are not a new area?, wrote Roger.
  [6]:   [7]: The Tails team set out the December release schedule [8] for version
1.2.1 of the anonymous live operating system.
  [8]: Giovanni Pellerano announced [9] version 3.1.30 of Tor2web, which now
supports web access to Tor hidden services over TLS. Access to the
Facebook hidden service, the most high-profile instance of an
HTTPS-enabled .onion site, is blocked in this version, as Tor2web offers
no benefit in cases where there exists an identical service on the
regular or ?naked? web, and may actually present additional risk of
  [9]: Griffin Boyce requested feedback [10] on a ?very rough? version of
Stormy [11], the simple hidden service setup wizard. ?I?d love to get
feedback on places where it breaks and where it could use a major
structural change [?] the current setup is entirely for development and
should not be used as-is.?
 [10]:  [11]: Virgil Griffith started a discussion [12] on the suitability of the name
?hidden services? as opposed to other possible terms like ?onion
service? or ?onion site?. Among the many responses, Roger Dingledine
suggested [13] that an alternative name like ?onion service? ?makes
people have to learn what it is rather than guessing (and often guessing
wrong)?, while Nathan Freitas pointed out [14] that as ?typical users
don?t talk about web services, they talk about web sites or pages?,
?onion site? might be a term worth adopting.
 [12]:  [13]:  [14]: Tom Ritter put forward [15] a number of improvements to the integration
of HTTPS certificates and hidden services, following ?a spirited debate
on IRC?.
 [15]: The Wikimedia Foundation is the latest high-profile organization to set
up a non-exit Tor relay [16]. ?It?s just a small contribution to the
network. Really ? anyone can do it.?

Tor Weekly News                                      November 26th, 2014
Welcome to the forty-seventh issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the
weekly newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
A new Tor directory authority
Nathan Freitas announced [8] the release of Orbot 14.1.3, which includes
improved handling of background processes; it builds on the earlier
14.1.0 [9], which brought with it support for Android 5.0 Lollipop, as
well as stability fixes. Orweb was brought up to version 0.7, also
introducing support for the new Android release.
  [8]:   [9]: George Kadianakis sent out [10] a co-authored draft of a proposal for
statistics concerning hidden service activity that relays could collect
and publish without harming the anonymity or security of users and
hidden services, and which might ?be useful to Tor developers and to
people who want to understand hidden services and the onionspace
 [10]: Tom Ritter drafted a proposal [11] exploring methods a hidden service
operator might use to prove to certificate authorities that they control
the service?s private key when requesting SSL certificates.
 [11]: Karsten Loesing spruced up [12] the documentation on the Tor Metrics
portal [13], including a handy glossary of frequently-used Tor-specific
terms [14].
 [12]:  [13]:  [14]: Damian Johnson sketched out a roadmap [15] for further development of
Stem [16], the Tor controller library in Python, welcoming ?more general
ideas on directions to take Stem, the tor-prompt, and this whole space?.
 [15]:  [16]: Andrew Lewman reported [17] on his experiments in mirroring the Tor
Project website using the Fastly CDN as well as the BitTorrent Sync
 [17]: Following a suggestion [18] that a guide to server hardening should be
distributed with the tor software package, Libertas drafted [19] a
sample document and asked for reviews. ?Please share any opinions or
contributions you have. This was written in a little more than an hour,
so it?s still a work in progress.?
 [18]:  [19]: Libertas also scanned [20] a large number of currently-running Tor
relays to check which ssh access authentication methods their servers
supported, finding 2051 relays that still permitted password-based ssh
authentication. ?Generally, it is far more secure to allow only public
key auth. The Ubuntu help pages have a good guide [21] on setting up
key-based auth?.
 [20]:  [21]: SiNA Rabbani noted [22] that a large proportion of Tor exit relays are
located in Europe, and called for relay operators to consider running
nodes with US hosts. ?I am not sure if the reason is lack of
Tor-friendly ISPs or people are just too freaked out about the summer of
Snowden. I think it?s very wrong to assume that EU countries are not
part of the world-wide-wiretap, packets are going through a few internet
exchanges anyways.?

Tor Weekly News                                        October 1st, 2014
Welcome to the thirty-ninth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
Tor 0.2.4.24 and 0.2.5.8-rc are out
The second point release in the Tails 1.1.x series was put out [11] by
the Tails team, ?mainly to fix a serious flaw in the Network Security
Services (NSS) library used by Firefox and other products that allows
attackers to create forged RSA certificates. Before this release, users
on a compromised network could be directed to sites using a fraudulent
certificate and mistake them for legitimate sites.?
Other packages affected by recently-disclosed security flaws and updated
in this version include APT, bash, and GnuPG, so all Tails users should
make sure to upgrade as soon as possible. If you have a running copy of
Tails, you can make use of the incremental upgrades system; otherwise,
head to the download page [12] for more information.
 [11]:  [12]: obfs4 is ready for general deployment: bridge operators needed!
Anthony G. Basile announced [19] the release of version 20140925 of
tor-ramdisk, the micro Linux distribution whose only purpose is to host
a Tor server in an environment that maximizes security and privacy. This
release includes updates to Tor, BusyBox, OpenSSL, and the Linux kernel.
 [19]: As part of the current push to better understand hidden services and
their use on the Tor network, Roger Dingledine asked [20] relay
operators who are ?comfortable compiling Tor from git? and who ?want to
help investigate what fraction of Tor network load comes from hidden
service use? to check out the new hs-stats git branch. This version
?will collect per-thirty-minute statistics about number of circuits and
number of cells your relay sees that have to do with exiting, with
hidden services, with circuits where you're not the final hop, and a
fourth none-of-the-above category?, which can then be posted to the
appropriate ticket on the bug tracker [21] or sent to Roger directly.
 [20]:  [21]: Yawning Angel sent [22] a ?friendly reminder? to ScrambleSuit bridge
operators, asking them to upgrade to tor-0.2.5.x if they haven?t
already: ?If you are running a ScrambleSuit bridge with tor-0.2.4.x, it
is useless. Users that happen to be served your ScrambleSuit bridge will
not be able to connect, because the password is missing?.
 [22]: Mike Perry asked [23] relay operators, particularly those running exit
relays, to contribute information about the ?hardware, CPU cores, and
uplink? of their servers, and how much these cost per month, in order to
?put together some estimates on bounds of the current value and cost of
the capacity of the Tor network as it is, and use that to generate some
rough guestimates on what it would cost to grow it?.
 [23]: In response to the possible integration of Tor as a ?private browsing
mode? by a major browser vendor, Andrew Lewman kicked off [24] a
discussion of ways in which the Tor network might be scaled up to
accommodate ?hundreds of millions? of extra users.
 [24]: Tor help desk roundup
Tor StackExchange has started its site self-evaluation for September
2014 [26]. Ten questions were selected [27] and you?re asked to review
them. Are they good or is there room for improvement? Please have a look
at the questions and rate them.
 [26]:  [27]: Jens Kubieziel noted that users mix up the terms Tor, Tor Browser and
torbrowser-launcher [28], so he explained each of them to users of the
Q&A page.

Thanks for bringing this up once more! The topic seems to recur even more frequently than once a year around here.
Two recent and relevant discussions:
Your colleague Lane Rasberry started a similar thread earlier this year and an accompanying IdeaLab page, read more here:
 (third item down) and Not Wikimedia-specific, but Roger Dingledine recently wrote about paths to letting web services feel they can accept anonymous users, and mentioned an upcoming project on Wikipedia at the end:
It would be good if the experience of these and other previous discussions could be built upon, otherwise I fear this topic will continue to circle morosely on the luggage carousel of things that ought to be done, with no takers.
Thank you for running an exit relay!

Welcome to the forty-first issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
Academic research into Tor: four recent studies
Michael Rogers submitted?[13] patches against tor and jtorctl, making
two improvements to the performance of mobile hidden services: one
?avoids a problem where we'd try to build introduction circuits
immediately, all the circuits would fail, and we'd wait for 5 minutes
before trying again?, and the other ?[adds] a command to the control
protocol to purge any cached state relating to a specified hidden
Karsten Loesing published?[14] a ?non-functional? mock-up?[15] of a
possible redesign for the Tor Metrics portal, with notes on design
decisions: ?Feedback much appreciated. This is the perfect time to
consider your ideas.?
  [15]:?
Jeremy Gillula analyzed data relating to Tor node churn found in Tor
consensuses for September 2014, and found?[16] that ?on average, 0.003%
of nodes switch from being relay nodes to exit nodes in any given 1-hour
period, and 0.002% switch from being exit nodes to relay nodes?.
Noel Torres?[17] and Andrew Lewman?[18] sent their status reports for
September. Roger Dingledine also sent out the report for SponsorF?[19].
Greg Norcie wondered?[20] why the interval at which Tor switches to
using a new circuit was set at ten minutes, and Nick Mathewson
responded?[21] that after the original period of thirty seconds was
found to be unworkable, the new number was selected in 2005 ?more or
less intuitively?. Paul Syverson added?[22] that the choice was ?an
informed one?, taken after ?a bunch of discussions concerning the
trade-offs between the overhead of the public-key operations of circuit
building and the pseudonymous profiling occurring at an exit?.
Both Tor and Tails received their first cinematic credits?[23] with the
premi?re of ?CITIZENFOUR??[24], a documentary film concerning the recent
disclosure of intelligence documents by Edward Snowden. Eagle-eyed
viewers might spot a well-known hostname in the film?s trailer??[25]

supports Whonix 9, a community forum has been set up, and greater
upstream integration is being discussed.

Tor Weekly News                                       October 22nd, 2014
Welcome to the forty-second issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
Tor 0.2.5.9-rc is out
Mike Perry announced [5] a major release by the Tor Browser team.
Version 4.0 of the secure and anonymous web browser brings several
exciting new features to the stable series, including the meek [6]
censorship-circumvention tool, the secure updater, and a simplified
Javascript enabling/disabling process in NoScript, all based on a
customized Firefox ESR31. SSLv3 is also disabled, in response to the
recent POODLE attack.
This release contains important security fixes, and all users should
upgrade as soon as possible. Please note that the new directory
structure means users cannot simply extract the new Tor Browser over
their existing 3.6.6 directory, and must instead delete the old version
entirely. The secure updater still requires manual activation in the
?About Tor Browser? menu option, as its security will depend ?on the
specific CA that issued the  HTTPS certificate
(Digicert)? until site-specific certificate pinning [7] and signed
update files [8] are implemented. Furthermore, ?we still need to improve
meek?s performance to match other transports?, wrote Mike, ?so adjust
your expectations accordingly?.
See Mike?s post for further details and a full changelog, and get your
copy of Tor Browser 4.0 from the distribution directory [9] or the
download page [10].

tagnaq warned [14] users of TorBirdy [15], the torifying extension for
the Thunderbird mail client, that a change in Thunderbird 31?s handling
of the ?reply_header_authorwrote? header means that the word ?wrote?,
translated into the user?s system language, may be inserted before
quoted text when replying to emails, leaking the system language to
recipients of replies if not removed. Jacob Appelbaum responded [16]
that a new release of TorBirdy addressing this and other issues was
 [14]:  [15]:  [16]: Arturo Filast? announced [17] the release of ooniprobe 1.1.2, containing
?two new report entry keys, test_start_time and test_runtime?, and a fix
for a bug that ?led to ooniresources not working properly?.
 [17]: evilaliv3 announced [18] version 3.1.20 of tor2web, an HTTP proxy that
enables access to hidden services without a Tor client, for users who do
not require strong anonymity. As well as ?some networking bugfixing and
optimizations?, this release adds a ?replace? mode for remotely-fetched
blocklists in addition to ?merge?, and a feature that allows different
hostnames to be mapped to specific hidden services.
 [18]: Karsten Loesing gave users of Onionoo a ?one-month heads-up? [19] that
on or after November 15th, a change to the protocol will let the search
parameter ?accept base64-encoded fingerprints in addition to hex-encoded
fingerprints, nicknames, and IP addresses.? These searches will also
return relays whose base64-encoded fingerprints are a partial match for
the search string. ?If you?re fine with that, feel free to ignore this
message and do nothing?, but if not, ?you?ll have to filter out those
relays locally?.
 [19]: Following updates to the Tor Project?s website, Sebastian Hahn drew
attention [20] to a change in the steps necessary to run a website
mirror [21]. ?Please ask if you run into any trouble, and thanks for
providing a mirror!?
 [20]:  [21]: Inspired by ?the Directory Authorities, the crappy experiment leading up
to Black Hat, and the promise that one can recreate the Tor network in
the event of some catastrophe?, Tom Ritter sent out a detailed
report [22] of issues he encountered while setting up his own Tor
network using ?full-featured independent tor daemons?, rather than a
network simulator like Shadow or Chutney [23].
 [22]:  [23]: Cthulhu asked for assistance in overhauling the GoodBadISP page [24],
which is the starting point for many relay operators around the world.
If you have some time to spare, or know some ISPs not yet on the list,
it would be greatly appreciated if they could be added to the page. This
new effort to reach out to hosting providers could be of great value
after years of what Roger Dingledine has described [25] as a ?slash and
burn? agriculture model of operating Tor nodes.
 [24]:  [25]: Vladimir Martyanov started a discussion [26] on the question of whether
Tor developers should ensure that tor can still be built using compilers
that do not support the C99 programming language standard, such as older
versions of Microsoft Visual Studio.

automatic downloading of messages from POP3 accounts, and ensures that
draft messages for IMAP accounts are stored on the local system rather
than sent over the network. However, as Jacob wrote, ?it?s still
experimental?, so ?use at your own risk?. See the release announcement
for a full changelog.
  [4]:   [5]: Anthony G. Basile announced [6] version 20141022 of tor-ramdisk, the
micro Linux distribution whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in
an environment that maximizes security and privacy. This release
addresses the recent POODLE attack [7] with updates to Tor and OpenSSL,
and also upgrades the Linux kernel.
  [6]:   [7]: Yawning Angel called for testing [8] of the revamped tor-fw-helper, a
tool that automates the port forwarding required (for example) by the
flash proxy [9] pluggable transport. Please see Yawning?s message for
full testing instructions and other important information: ?Questions,
Comments, Feedback appreciated?.
  [8]:   [9]: On the Tor blog, Andrew Lewman responded [10] to the abuse of Tor by
creators of so-called ?ransomware?, or malware that tries to restrict
access to users? files unless a ransom is paid; these extortionists
sometimes ask their victims to install Tor software in order to
communicate with them over a hidden service, leading users to the
mistaken belief that The Tor Project is somehow involved. As Andrew
wrote, this software ?is unrelated to The Tor Project. We didn?t produce
it, and we didn?t ask to be included in the criminal infection of any
computer.? Users may find the information provided by the BBC [11] and
Bleeping Computer [12] to be helpful in resolving the problem.
 [10]:  [11]:  [12]: Josh Pitts posted an analysis [13] of apparently malicious behavior by a
Tor relay that was modifying binary files downloaded over Tor circuits
in which it was the exit node. As Roger Dingledine responded [14],
?we?ve now set the BadExit flag on this relay, so others won?t
accidentally run across it?.
 [13]:  [14]: David Fifield pointed out [15] ?an apparent negative correlation between
obfs3 users and vanilla users? in the Tor Metrics portal?s bridge user
graphs [16] and wondered what might be causing it.

Tor Weekly News                                      September 3rd, 2014
Welcome to the thirty-fifth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
Tor Browser 3.6.5 and 4.0-alpha-2 are out
The Tails team released [5] version 1.1.1 of the Debian- and Tor-based
live operating system. As well as upgrading key components like Tor,
Iceweasel, and Linux, this release disables I2P by default when Tails is
booted, in response to the vulnerability recently disclosed by Exodus
Intelligence [6]. Like Truecrypt, ?i2p? must now be specified as a
parameter on booting by users who wish to use it.
A number of other security fixes and routine improvements make this an
important update for all Tails users. See the full changelog in the
team?s announcement, then update from a running copy of Tails 1.1 if you
have one, or head to the download page [7] if you don?t.
  [5]:   [6]:   [7]: Helping Internet services accept anonymous users
Yawning Angel released [26] a new set of experimental Tor Browser builds
containing the proposed obfs4 pluggable transport, along with a
changelog; ?questions, comments, feedback? are welcome on the email
thread or the bug ticket tracking the deployment of obfs4 [27].
 [26]:  [27]: Arturo Filast? announced [28] the release of version 1.1.0 of
oonibackend, the tool ?used by ooniprobe to discover the addresses of
test helpers (via the bouncer) to submit reports to (via the collector)
and to perform some measurements that require a backend system to talk
to (via test helpers)? [29].
 [28]:  [29]: meejah posted [30] a list of tasks to be completed in order to bring Tor
Weather to a deployable state, following the recent rewrite effort and
the Google Summer of Code project by Sreenatha Bhatlapenumarthi.
 [30]: Israel Leiva submitted a summary [31] of work completed as part of the
?Revamp GetTor? Google Summer of Code project: ?The plan for now is to
keep doing tests and deploy it asap (hopefully during September).?
 [31]: Mike Perry posted [32] an updated version [33] of the proposal for
website fingerprinting countermeasures which he co-authored with Marc
Juarez as part of the latter?s Google Summer of Code project.
 [32]:  [33]: Lunar gave a talk [34] at this year?s DebConf on the effort to build
Debian packages deterministically, which is inspired in large part by
Tor Browser?s use of the same technology [35]. Major progress was
achieved during the conference [36].
 [34]:  [35]:  [36]: David Fifield submitted a breakdown [37] of the costs incurred by the
infrastructure that supports the meek pluggable transport [38] since its
introduction. The total to date from both the Google App Engine and
Amazon AWS front domains? $6.56.
 [37]:  [38]: Thanks to P D [39] and Daniel Pajonzeck [40] for running mirrors of the
Tor Project website and software!
 [39]:  [40]: Also on the subject of mirrors, Roger Dingledine alerted [41] the
tor-mirrors mailing list to the fact that the Tor Project website
(specifically the distribution directory) will shortly be increasing in
size to eight or nine gigabytes, as a result of the
soon-to-be-implemented Tor Browser updater [42]. Mirror operators will
need to ensure that they can provide enough disk space to accommodate
the change.
 [41]:  [42]: whonixqubes announced [43] the release of an integrated version of the
Whonix and Qubes operating systems: ?I look forward to helping make
Qubes + Whonix integration even tighter and more seamless throughout the
 [43]: Tor help desk roundup
Anony Mouse wanted to know why Facebook shows the location of the user?s
last login over Tor as Baghdad or Dhaka [45], instead of the real
location of the exit relay. qbi posted a screenshot showing this
issue [46]. According to Facebook, this information is based on an
approximation, but this approximation locates all Tor exit relays either in Baghdad or in Dhaka.
 [45]:  [46]: user3500 wants to contribute to Tor and asks how this can be done as an
inexperienced developer [47]. Jens Kubieziel replied with several
possibilities, including reading the volunteer page and Tor Weekly News:
in particular, the section containing easy development tasks might be a
good start. Roya pointed out that any contribution is better than no
contribution, and encouraged user3500 to just get started. Umut Seven
recommended writing unit tests.
 [47]: Kras wants to use FoxyProxy in connection with Tor Browser Bundle and
asks if it is safe to do so [48]. At the moment, there is only an answer
saying ?yes?, without any explanation. What is your experience? Is it
safe for a user to install and use FoxyProxy?

@_subject: [tor-talk] =?utf-8?q?TBB_3=2E6=2E5_not_on_download_site=3F?= 
After members of the Tor Browser team confirmed yesterday that they were planning to release 3.6.5 on the 2nd, I chose to keep the announcement in, hoping that the official blog post would soon be up and that the download links would be changed. I asked several times on IRC if I should go ahead, and no one seemed to have strong feelings.
This has happened more than once and I don't really know what to do about it. If the Tor Browser team object to Tor Weekly News announcing things, I have no problem with not doing so. On the other hand, the software is available in the /dist directory (I'm using it now!), so it has ?been released?.

Welcome to the thirty-sixth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
More monthly status reports for August 2014
Nathan Freitas announced [7] the release of Orbot 14.0.8, containing
?some fixes for people who like to fiddle with transproxy/iptables
settings, which can lead to the device getting into a bad network
state?, as well as for ?a common freak crash that was occuring on app
exit in some cases.? See Nathan?s message for a full changelog and
download links.
  [7]: Mike Perry asked for comments [8] on his proposal to drop Tor Browser
support for Mac OS X 10.6, which is no longer receiving security updates
from Apple. This means that the Tor Browser team would only have to
distribute standard-sized 64-bit builds for Mac OS X rather than the
oversized 32+64-bit set. Users who are unable to upgrade their operating
system would still be able to use Tails for their Tor browsing needs.
  [8]: Hartmut Haase reported [9] that Tor Browser occasionally fails to open,
despite a successful connection being made to the Tor network; several
other users confirmed that they are also experiencing this problem.
Georg Koppen suggested [10] that the issue is the one covered by bug
ticket  [11]: ?Solving this is high on the priority list, but alas
not as high as getting everything ready for the switch to ESR31.?
  [9]:  [10]:  [11]: Thanks to Peter Ludikovsky [12] and goll [13] for running mirrors of the
Tor Project website and software archive!
 [12]:  [13]: Andrew Lewman published [14] the results of a test he ran to answer the
question ?Why not just use CloudFlare for mirrors of the Tor Project
website??: ?The results are that using CloudFlare doesn?t offload the
binaries, which are what make up the bulk of traffic on the mirror [?]
I?ve started to look at CDN providers to see if there are affordable
services which can offload the entire site itself.?
 [14]: As part of an ongoing effort to rescue the Tor blog from rot and ruin
caused by broken Drupal code, ultrasandwich set up [15] an unofficial
preview [16] of a possible blog based on the Jekyll static site
generator. If you want to contribute to the revamp of the Tor Project
website, including the blog, the www-team mailing list [17] awaits your
comments and ideas!

@_subject: [tor-talk] =?utf-8?q?Advertising_a_hidden_service=3F?= 
Just as you would publicize any other website. Many people (technology journalists among them) appear to think that "the hidden internet" or "the dark web" is something that must be "tunneled into" and accessed only through a special portal such as the ones you have mentioned, when really they should be thinking of hidden services as usable alongside - and linkable from - any other web service.
Restricting the advertisement of hidden services to other hidden services will not help defeat the "dark web" mental model.
Of course, it then depends on the nature of your service and the target

Welcome to the thirty-seventh issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the
weekly newsletter that covers what?s happening in the community around
Tor, the anonymity network that makes full use of its library card.
tor 0.2.5.7-rc is out
Nathan Freitas announced [13] version 14.0.8.1 of Orbot, the Tor client
for Android. The highlights of this release are an upgrade to tor
0.2.5.7-rc (see above), which solves an issue with the ?airplane mode?
feature, as well as a number of improvements to do with transparent
proxying. Find the full changelog and download links in Nathan?s
 [13]: Juha Nurmi described [14] the current state of ahmia.fi, the search
engine for hidden services, following a successful Google Summer of Code
project. The post includes notes on the design, content statistics, and
plans for future work.
 [14]: David Fifield called for a volunteer operating a ?big fast bridge? [15]
to take over the running of the meek [16] pluggable transport: ?I want
to do this both to diffuse trust, so that I don?t run all the
infrastructure, and because my bridge is not especially fast and I?m not
especially adept at performance tuning?.
 [15]:  [16]: David also wondered why the number of FTE users appeared to dip in late
August [17], and explored possible reasons behind the correlation in
usage statistics for meek and Flashproxy, whose backends both run on the
same bridge [18]. Karsten Loesing suggested [19] that the latter was
because ?we?re counting consensuses downloaded from a bridge via any
supported transport, and then we?re attributing those downloads to
specific transports based on what fraction of IPs connected per
 [17]:  [18]:  [19]: Tim reported [20] on progress made towards a ?fuzzer? [21] for Tor,
based on the Tor research framework previously announced by Gareth
Owen [22], including a draft design for the process and a list of
patches against Tor made during development.

Welcome to the thirty-eighth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the
weekly newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
The EFF concludes its 2014 Tor Challenge
The Tails team wants to make sure that all the Debian packages on which
Tails relies are ?in good shape? before Jessie, the next Debian release,
is frozen on 5th November. To that end, the team called for testing both
of the software itself [11] and its translations [12] ? if you?d like to
help, find full instructions and links to the ?barely-working?
experimental disk images in the announcements.
 [11]:  [12]: meek [13], the pluggable transport that routes Tor traffic through
platforms which are ?too big to block?, now works with Microsoft Azure
in addition to the already-supported Google App Engine and Amazon Web
Services. David Fifield posted the announcement [14], which contains
instructions for those who want to start using the new front domain.
 [13]:  [14]: Sebastian Hahn announced [15] that gabelmoo, the Tor directory authority
which he administers, has moved to a new IP address. ?You should not
notice any kind of disturbance from this, and everything should continue
to work as normal.?
 [15]: Released in December 2013, the SafePlug is a $49 router that promises
its users ?complete security and anonymity? online by sending all of
their traffic through Tor. Annie Edmundson from Princeton University
released a summary [16] of research presented during FOCI?14 [17] in
which the authors point out several security problems in the
implementation of the SafePlug administration interface, and also
highlight other structural issues. ?The most crucial problem with a
torifying proxy is that it uses a bring-your-own-browser system, as
opposed to a hardened browser, and therefore is susceptible to
browser-based privacy leaks. This is why it?s better to use the Tor
Browser Bundle [?]?, wrote Annie.
 [16]:  [17]: The upcoming Tor Messenger is based on Instantbird [18]. One key feature
that was identified as missing in the latter is support for
Off-the-Record encryption [19]. After months of discussions and reviews
to determine the right programming interface, Arlo Breault got the
necessary core modifications merged [20, 21].
 [18]:  [19]:  [20]:  [21]: Roger Dingledine wrote up a walkthrough [22] of the controller events
you might see when accessing Tor hidden services. ?In theory the
controller events should help you understand how far we got at reaching
a hidden service when the connection fails. In practice it?s a bit
overwhelming? [23].
 [22]:  [23]: In the first message posted to the recently-created onionoo-announce
mailing list [24], Karsten Loesing explained [25] a minor improvement
that should allow Onionoo clients to determine when they need to be
upgraded to a new protocol version.
 [24]:  [25]: Leiah, whose design work has featured on many of Tor?s company
publications, posted [26] a mock-up of a possible new look for the Tor
 [26]: Patrick Schleizer announced [27] the release of version 9 of Whonix, the
anonymous operating system based on Tor, Debian, and
 [27]: Tor help desk roundup
Jobiwan has a machine on their network which should act as a SOCKS
proxy. When Tor Browser is configured to use this proxy, it complains
that Tor is not working in this browser [30]. However, Jobiwan is able
to visit hidden services with these settings, and wants to know why this
message is printed and if it is safe to use Tor Browser this way. Do you
know a good answer to this question? If so, please share your thoughts.
 [30]: Andy Smith asks if slow relays are useful for the Tor network [31].
Roya suggests that a large number of slow relays is better than a small
number of fast relays, at least anonymity-wise, because this helps to
grow diversity in the network and makes it harder for an attacker to
deanonymize users. On the other hand, user194 and Relay Operator write
that a slow relay does not provide much benefit for the network. They
recommend spending a few dollars more to rent a fast virtual server.

Welcome to the thirteenth issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
Tor Browser 4.0.6 and 4.5a5 are out
Tails version 1.3.2 [5] was put out on March 31. This release includes
updates to key software, fixing numerous security issues. All Tails
users must upgrade as soon as possible; see the announcement for
download instructions.
  [5]: Crowdsourcing the future (of onion services)
Anthony G. Basile announced [17] version 20150322 of tor-ramdisk, the
micro Linux distribution whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in
an environment that maximizes security and privacy. This release
includes updates to Tor, busybox, OpenSSL, and the Linux kernel.
 [17]: George Kadianakis used some newly-discovered bridge statistics [18] to
generate visual bandwidth histories, in order ?to better understand how
much bridges are used?. ?Questions and feedback on my methodology are
welcome?, writes George. On the other hand, ?we should think about the
privacy implications of these statistics since they are quite
fine-grained (multiple measurements per day) and some bridges don?t have
many clients (hence small anonymity set for them)?, so if you have
comments on this topic feel free to send them to the thread.
 [18]: News from Tor StackExchange
A year ago this week [23], Tor developers were discussing the
possibility of distributing bridge relay addresses via QR code, to avoid
tricky copy-pastes and input errors that might cause a failed
connection.  Today, you can request some bridge lines from BridgeDB [24]
and select ?Show QR code? to be shown?exactly that. Bridge address QR
code recognition will soon make its way [25] into the Orbot stable
release, as well, so your simple censorship circumvention is no longer
dependent on finicky touchscreen keyboards!

Tor Browser 4.0.8 is out
Nathan Freitas announced [18] the third release candidate for Orbot v15.
This version supports the x86 processor architecture, so devices such as
the Galaxy Tab 3 and the Asus Zenphone/Padphone are now officially
Tor-compatible. See Nathan?s announcement for the full changelog.
 [18]: Giovanni Pellerano announced [19] GlobalLeaks 2.60.65, featuring lots of
bugfixes, improved localization (including eight new languages), and
 [19]: David Fifield located and fixed [20] a problem with meek?s Microsoft
Azure backend that was causing it to run much more slowly than the other
two options. ?If you tried meek-azure before, but it was too slow, give
it another try!?

Tor Browser 5.0 and 5.5a1 are out
The Tails developers announced version 1.5 [4] of the anonymous live
operating system. This release disables access to the local network in
Tor Browser, restricting this activity to Tails? ?unsafe browser?. It
also ships with Tor Browser 5.0, and a 32-bit GRUB EFI bootloader, so

Hot on the heels of last week?s 2.4 release, Karsten Loesing put out
version 2.5 [13] of Onionoo, the Tor network data observatory. This
release adds a new optional field named ?measured? to Onionoo?s details
documents. ?The main idea behind this new field is that relay operators
and Tor network debuggers can now figure out easily whether a relay is
affected by not being measured by a sufficient number of bandwidth
authorities and as a result has lower usage than it could handle?,
writes Karsten. The new field is not yet shown in Onionoo web interfaces
like Globe and Atlas, but it is accessible through the Onionoo API. For
more details, see the relevant ticket [14].
 [13]:  [14]: David Fifield announced that the recent outage affecting meek?s
Microsoft Azure backend is now resolved [15]. Most users will have
switched to the workaround version included in the most recent Tor
Browser releases, but if for some reason you are still using the old
configuration, it too should now be working once again.

Hash visualizations to protect against onion phishing
Richard Hartmann, Peter Palfrader, and Jonathan McDowell have set up the
first official onion service mirrors [4] of the Debian operating
system?s software package infrastructure. This means that it is now
possible to update your Debian system without the update information or
downloaded packages leaving the Tor network at all, preventing a network
adversary from discovering information about your system. A follow-up
post by Richard [5] includes guidance on using apt-transport-tor [6]
with the new mirrors.
These services are only the first in what should hopefully become a
fully Tor-enabled system mirroring ?the complete package lifecycle,
package information, and the website?. ?This service is not redundant,
it uses a key which is stored on the local drive, the .onion will
change, and things are expected to break?, wrote Richard, but if you are
interested in trying out the new infrastructure, see the write-ups for
further information.

 [12]: Nick Mathewson submitted a draft of proposal 241 [13], which aims to
protect users against adversaries who are able to attack their
connectivity to the Tor network and force them to use malicious guard
nodes. Roger Dingledine offered [14] some further thoughts.
 [13]:  [14]: Nick also set out the schedule for the Tor 0.2.6 feature freeze [15].
 [15]: After reports from users that Tor Browser?s default obfs4 bridges are no
longer usable in China, David Fifield estimated [16] the time it takes
for the ?Great Firewall? to react to new circumvention systems as lying
?between 2 and 10 weeks?, and asked for additional data to narrow the
range further.
 [16]: Isis Lovecruft ?would be super stoked if we could make it as easy and
seamless as possible for the bridge operators who are still running
obfs2 (!!) to move to supporting better, newer pluggable transports?,
such as obfs4, and wondered [17] how to make it possible for operators
running Debian stable to get the necessary dependencies onto their
system without extensive backporting: ?If someone has done this, or has
another simple solution, would you mind writing up some short how-to on
the steps you took, please??

disadvantages of removing AdBlock Plus from Tails? version of Tor

it with the ooni-dev mailing list, along with a request for missing data

Welcome to the sixth issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the community around Tor,
?your online an-onionising software? [1].
  [1]: The 2015 Tor UX Sprint
Now that Vidalia, the graphical user interface for Tor, has been
completely unmaintained ?for too long to be a recommended solution?,
Sebastian Hahn has removed [10] the last links to Vidalia-related
content from the Tor Project website. If you are still using a version
of Tor Browser (outside of Tails) that contains Vidalia, it is almost
certainly too old to be safe, so please upgrade as soon as possible.
Vidalia is still shipped in the latest version of Tails, however, so the
Tails team has been working [11] on a simple interface [12] to replace
one of the most-missed features of the defunct program, the circuit
visualization window. The Tor Browser team have already implemented a
similar per-site circuit diagram [13] in the current 4.5-alpha series,
so there should soon be no reason at all for users to continue
controlling their Tor through Vidalia.
 [10]:  [11]:  [12]:  [13]: More monthly status reports for January 2015
George Kadianakis linked [22] to the technical report produced by the
team working on statistics related to the amount of hidden service usage
on the Tor network; Karsten Loesing added [23] some more information
regarding the fraction of network activity this represents. These are
advanced calculations, so if you?re not experienced in data science but
want to know more about this topic, the team will be back shortly with a
more ?casual-reader-friendly? analysis of the results.
 [22]:  [23]: ?Fresh off a round of real-world intensive testing and debugging using
spotty 2.5G coverage in the foothills of the Himalayas?, Nathan Freitas
of the ever-intrepid Guardian Project announced [24] the first release
candidate for version 14.1 of ChatSecure, the ?most private? messaging
client for Android and iOS, featuring numerous improvements to
usability, stability, and network handling. Please see Nathan?s
announcement for the full changelog.
 [24]: Nathan also shared [25] a ?very early? incarnation of PLUTO, ?a
simplified means for developers to include traffic obfuscation
capabilities into their applications? with initial support for obfs4 and
meek. ?We think many apps could utilize this approach to defeat DPI
filtering, and that this would be useful to offer decoupled from the way
Tor integrates it?.
 [25]: David Fifield posted a tutorial [26] for configuring the meek pluggable
transport to work with hard-to-block HTTPS websites interested in
helping censored Tor users, rather than the large content delivery
networks it currently uses, along with the regular summary [27] of the
costs incurred by meek?s infrastructure last month: ?meek has so far
been a smashing success. It?s the  pluggable transport behind obfs3
and it moved over 5 TB of traffic last month. But the costs are starting
to get serious.? If you have ideas for supporting this vitally important

 [26]:  [27]: Also in meek news, Across The Great FireWall published [28] a
Chinese-language introduction to the concepts underpinning this
pluggable transport. Other resources (in Chinese and other languages)
are listed on the wiki [29].
 [28]:  [29]: Nick Mathewson took to the Tor blog [30] to explain exactly what Tor
design proposals are for and how they are written, and offered status
updates (and review recommendations) [31] for some new and still-open
 [30]:  [31]: Nick also asked [32] relay operators to contribute their advice to a
relay hardening guide [33] that could be shipped with Tor.
 [32]:  [33]: Arturo Filast? asked for help [34] in coming up with a roadmap for the
future of the Open Observatory of Network Interference, asking for
opinions on a range of possible development, deployment, and research
projects. Feel free to let the ooni-dev list know which of the ideas
catches your attention.
 [34]: After soliciting feedback [35] on including newer pluggable transports
in Tails, the Tails team decided [36] to focus on obfs4 and then
(?tentatively?) meek for upcoming versions of the anonymous live
operating system.
 [35]:  [36]: Tom ?TvdW? van der Woerdt wrote a detailed report [37] on his experience
implementing a Tor client from scratch in the Go programming language,
following Tor?s specification document. One instance of ?GoTor? briefly
broke the Tor relay speed record with 250 megabytes/second, but Tom
ultimately decided that Go isn?t the right language for such a thing, as
its library support doesn?t make it easy enough to do. Thanks to Tom for
running the experiment, and catching some specification errors in the
 [37]: Even though Tor Browser is not vulnerable to the recent WebRTC IP attack
proof-of-concept [38], Mike Perry nevertheless invited [39] ?interested
parties to try harder to bypass Tor in a stock Firefox using WebRTC and
associated protocols (RTSP, SCTP) with media.peerconnection.enabled set
to false?, before a plan to enable WebRTC-based QRCode bridge address
resolution and sharing in Tor Launcher [40] is implemented.
 [38]:  [39]:  [40]: Shadow, the tool by Rob Jansen that allows full Tor network simulation,
now has a new website [41]. As Rob wrote [42]: ?The new website still
uses the Jekyll engine, and is a stripped down customized version of the
open source SOLID theme. Please send me feedback if you have it.?
 [41]:  [42]: Jillian York of the EFF discussed [43] the problems of over-reliance on
US government funding ? and the dearth of other funding streams ? for
anti-surveillance tools, including Tor.
 [43]: Seven of the eleven activists arrested last year in Spain for, amongst
other things, having had email accounts with the technical collective
Riseup ? longtime Tor allies and operators of one of the directory
authorities [44] ? have been released from prison [45]. As Riseup

Welcome to the seventh issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
Onion services
Nathan Freitas of the Guardian Project announced [5] the release of
version 15-alpha-3 of Orbot. This release includes more work on VPN
support, and builds on last week?s early release of the PLUTO
library [6] to offer support for meek [7], although it is not currently
possible to use both at the same time. See Nathan?s announcement for
usage instructions and download links.
  [5]:   [6]:   [7]: Yawning Angel asked for comments [8] on an implementation of a
proposal [9] to let Tor create ?ephemeral? onion services, using key
material that is supplied at runtime rather than stored on the disk. See
Yawning?s post for a detailed explanation of the concept and a link to
the new code; however, trying to run this untested and unreviewed new
branch ?WILL BROADCAST YOUR SECRETS TO THE NSA?S ORBITAL SPACE STATION?,
so don?t do that.
  [8]:   [9]: Yawning also announced [10] version 0.0.4 of obfs4proxy, which ?is more
useful for the Tor Browser people than anyone else, since it means that
the next build can remove the old go.crypto cruft from the build
process, and the ScrambleSuit client provider can be switched over to
obfs4proxy like obfs2 and obfs3 have been?.
 [10]: SiNA Rabbani announced that Faravahar, the directory authority which he
operates, will be moving to a new IP address on Friday [11].
 [11]: Thanks to cuanto [12] for running a mirror of the Tor Project website
and software!
 [12]: Thomas White published [13] a guide [14] to configuring an Nginx
webserver as a hidden service: ?It isn?t intended to be a hardening
guide or an ultra secure way of hosting, but it is for people who want
to casually publish some static HTML files or with a little extra
configuration to host some applications?.
 [13]:  [14]: Collin Anderson and the University of Toronto?s Citizen Lab made a joint
submission [15] to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and
expression, examining the importance of digital security software such
as Tor in upholding free expression and the right to privacy.
 [15]: carlo von lynX wondered [16] about the truth of the statement that ?it
would take latencies in the order of hours to fully make communications
impossible to shape and correlate?. Roger Dingledine clarified [17]:
?It?s actually worse than that ? we have no idea. I?d love to have a
graph where the x axis is how much additional overhead (latency,
bandwidth, whatever) we?re willing to add, and the y axis is how much
additional security (anonymity, privacy, whatever) we can get. Currently
we have zero data points for this graph.?

Welcome to the eighth issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
Tor 0.2.6-alpha-3 is out
The Tails team announced [3] version 1.3 of the anonymous live operating
system. This release brings several major new features, including
Bitcoin support with Electrum; connections to Tor using the obfs4
pluggable transport; an AppArmor profile to protect the filesystem
against some kinds of attack on Tor Browser; a simpler Tails drive
creation process on Mac and Linux; and more intuitive handling of
computer trackpads.
See the announcement for links to the full list of changes and known
issues, and download your copy from the website [4] or, if you already
have a running Tails, using the incremental update system.
  [3]:   [4]: CITIZENFOUR wins many awards
Giovanni Pellerano released [12] a security advisory for a bug in
GlobaLeaks that was introduced on 28th January 2015, and fixed on 16th
February. The bug could have allowed an attacker to read any file in the
key; if you installed or upgraded your GlobaLeaks instance on or between
those dates, please see Giovanni?s announcement for more details, and
upgrade again as soon as possible.
 [12]: Nathan Freitas announced [13] Orbot version 15-alpha-4, featuring bridge
scanning and distribution via QR code, and simpler configuration for
pluggable transports like meek, among other improvements.
 [13]: Rob Jansen announced [14] a major new release of Shadow [15], the Tor
network simulation tool. New features include support for running
Bitcoin software inside the simulation, client activity modelling using
dependency graphs, and much more.
 [14]:  [15]: Yaron Goland updated [16] the Tor Onion Proxy libary [17], a project to
?enable Android and Java applications to easily host their own Tor Onion
Proxies using the core Tor binaries?. This release incorporates newer
software and a simplified build process.
 [16]:  [17]: The organizers of the Workshop on Surveillance and Technology issued a
call for papers [18] ahead of their event, which will be held on June
29th. The deadline for submission is midnight UTC on March 11th; please
see SAT?s website for topics covered by the workshop and submission

Welcome to the first issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
Tor 0.2.6.2-alpha is out
Nick Mathewson and Andrea Shepard drafted a proposal [29] for including
a hash chain in the consensus [30] produced by Tor directory
authorities [31], in order to prevent certain kinds of attack on the
directory authorities and their keys.
 [29]:  [30]:  [31]: Nick also clarified [32] that a recently-discovered Libevent
vulnerability has no effect on Tor.
 [32]: In connection with the current push to collect statistics relating to
Tor hidden services in a privacy-preserving manner, Aaron Johnson
noted [33] that there are two further desirable sets of statistics which
might pose a risk to anonymity if gathered incorrectly, and discussed
possible solutions to the problem.
 [33]: David Fifield published a summary [34] of costs incurred by the meek
pluggable transport for the month of December 2014.
 [34]: David also continued his experiments on historical Tor metrics data with
visualizations of a recent Sybil attack [35], and wondered [36] what
might have been responsible for a sudden change in the way that users in
Kazakhstan were choosing to connect to the Tor network in October 2014.
 [35]:  [36]: Sebastian Urbach noted [37] a sudden drop in the number of Tor relays
acting as hidden service directories, and wondered about the cause. As
SiNA Rabbani clarified [38], the amount of time a relay needs to have
been running before it earns the ?HSDir? flag was increased by directory
authorities, in response to a recent Sybil attack.
 [37]:  [38]: The developers of ChatSecure for iOS announced [39] that their recent
3.0 release includes experimental support for connections to XMPP chat
servers over Tor, and briefly described how they added the new feature.

Welcome to the second issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
What to do if meek gets blocked
sycamoreone announced [3] orc, a Go library that implements parts of
Tor?s control protocol. ?I do have some ideas for a higher-level
interface, but no fixed plan yet. The next step will probably be to add
net/http-like handlerFuncs to handle (asynchronous) replies from the
onion router.?
  [3]: taxakis linked [4] to ?Post-Quantum Secure Onion Routing? [5] by
Satrajit Ghosh and Aniket Kate, a new paper proposing a successor to the
currently-used ntor handshake protocol that would be ?resilient against
quantum attacks, but also at the same time allow OR nodes to use the
current DH public keys, and consequently require no modification to the
current Tor public key infrastructure.? Nick Mathewson wondered [6]
whether ?anybody around here has the cryptographic background to comment
on the PQ part of their scheme??, and compared it to Yawning Angel?s
experimental ?basket? protocol [7].
  [4]:   [5]:   [6]:   [7]: Nick also sent out a draft of proposal 240 [8], describing ?a simple way
for directory authorities to perform signing key revocation?.
  [8]: Daniel Forster asked [9] for advice on proposed research into splitting
traffic over multiple entry guards in combination with traffic padding:
?Is the approach heading in a not so great direction w.r.t. the Tor
Project?s ?only one entry node? decision??
  [9]: Karsten Loesing submitted his status report for December [10], and
George Kadianakis sent out the report for SponsorR [11].
 [10]:  [11]: ?After CCC I have a list of people that I have given raspberry pi?s with
ooniprobe, and I would like to start coordinating with them via a
mailing list?, wrote Arturo Filast? [12], and the result is the
ooni-operators mailing list [13]. If you regularly run ooniprobe, or
want to start, be sure to sign up!
 [12]:  [13]: Aleksejs Popovs shared with the ooni-dev mailing list [14] the results
of an OONI investigation into Latvian internet censorship, conducted
using ooniprobe.
 [14]: Dan O?Huiginn started a conversation [15] about how to ensure users are
informed of the possible consequences of running OONI tests.
 [15]: Thanks to John Knoll [16] and Monsieur Tino [17] for running mirrors of
the Tor Project?s website and software archive!
 [16]:  [17]: ?How do we prevent a website mirror admin from tampering with the served
files??, wondered Fr?d?ric Cornu [18]. Christian Krbusek clarified [19]
that ?in fact, you can?t prevent that, but you are also mirroring the
signature files. So anybody downloading from any mirror ? even the
original host ? should verify the downloads?. Andrew Lewman added [20]
that ?the binaries are signed by well-known keys of tor packagers and
developers. The mirror update script randomly selects a binary and
verifies it each time it runs. If the binaries don?t match, the mirror
is removed from the public list.?

Welcome to the third issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the boring [1] Tor community.
  [1]: Tor Browser 4.0.3 and 4.5a3 are out
Anthony G. Basile announced [4] version 20150114 of Tor-ramdisk, the
uClibc-based micro Linux distribution whose only purpose is to host a
Tor relay in an environment that maximizes security and privacy. This
release includes updates to Tor, Libevent, and other key software.
  [4]: Nik announced [5] oppy, an onion proxy implemented in Python: ?oppy
works like a regular Tor client?, though ?there are a number of
simplifications made, with the major ones primarily centering around
circuit management/build logic and how and when network status documents
are collected?. Nik also asked for suggestions on how to take the
project forward: ?Whether or not I continue hacking on oppy to make it a
solid piece of software (rather than just a prototype) or just leave it
as is as a reference depends on whether or not the Tor development
community sees any real uses or future potential for the project?.
  [5]: meejah announced [6] a new one-to-one encrypted and anonymous voice chat
feature for ?carml? [7], the command-line Tor control utility: ? [It]
essentially cross-connects the mic + speakers of each side via an Opus +
OGG stream over a single Tor TCP connection.? As meejah warns, it is
?NOT FOR REAL USE at all yet?, but if you have experience with gstreamer
and/or OGG then please see meejah?s message for some unresolved
  [6]:   [7]: Following suggestions from Sebastian Urbach [8] and grarpamp [9],
Karsten Loesing altered [10] the main unit of data rate measurement for
the Tor Metrics portal [11] from MiB/s (mebibytes per second) to the
more common Gbit/s (gigabits per second).

The future of Private Browsing Mode
After a ?pretty big overhaul? [2], Damian Johnson announced that
Stem [3], the Tor controller library, now ?lazy-loads? descriptors,
resulting in a considerable speed increase when reading network
documents [4]. ?Note that descriptor validation is now opt-in rather

Tor Messenger Third Alpha is out
Donncha O?Cearbhaill, one of the students participating in the
first-ever Tor Summer of Privacy [3], released the first alpha version
of his OnionBalance tool [4]. OnionBalance ?provides load-balancing and
redundancy for Tor hidden services by distributing client requests to
multiple backend Tor instances?; if you run an onion service that
handles a large number of client requests, or require automatic failover
in the event that some of your hardware fails or is seized, OnionBalance
will help to distribute the load evenly and efficiently.
The tool is currently under heavy development, and ?there are likely
bugs which cause the OnionBalance service to crash or not operate
correctly?. ?I would very much appreciate any feedback or bug reports.
In particular I would like to improve the documentation and make the
tool easier for operators to install and run?, writes Donncha. Please
see the release announcement for further information and installation

Griffin Boyce offered an update [17] on the development status of
Stormy, the one-click onion service setup tool: ?Right now, the scripts
are undergoing third-party testing to identify any obvious bugs before
sending them to security auditors?.
 [17]: Chloe posted details of an experiment [18] to detect malicious Tor
relays that might be stealing usernames and passwords that are not
protected by HTTPS connections.
 [18]: Juha Nurmi warned [19] that an attacker is creating fake onion addresses
that resemble those of popular onion services, including ahmia.fi, and
using them to interfere with the content of onion pages as clients
request them. Another update [20] gives more information about the
details of the attack.

Tor Weekly News                                          July 10th, 2015
Welcome to the twenty-seventh issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News,
the weekly newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
 1. Tails 1.4.1 is out  2. Tor Browser 4.5.3 and 5.0a3 are out
 3. Tor unaffected by new OpenSSL security issue
 4. OVH is the largest and fastest-growing AS on the Tor network
 5. More monthly status reports for June 2015
 6. Miscellaneous news
 7. Upcoming events
Tails 1.4.1 is out David Fifield published the regular summary of costs [23] incurred by
the infrastructure for the meek pluggable transport over the past month.
?The rate limiting of meek-google and meek-amazon has been partially
effective in bringing costs down. [?] meek-azure bandwidth use continues
to increase, up 17% compared to the previous month. Keep in mind that
our grant expires in October, so you should not count on it continuing
to work after that.?
 [23]: Following Donncha O?Cearbhaill?s 0.0.1 alpha release of
OnionBalance [24], s7r called for help [25] putting it to the test on a
running onion service. One week on [26], there have been four million
hits on the service, with hardly a murmur of complaint from OnionBalance
or the service it is handling: ?the same instances are running since
service first started, no reboot or application restart?. See s7r?s post
for more numbers.

Welcome to the twenty-eighth issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the
weekly newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
 1. Caspar Bowden
 2. The Tor Project launches its search for a new Executive Director
 3. Tor 0.2.6.10 is out

Caspar Bowden
Caspar Bowden, a leading advocate for many years in the field of civil
liberties, and a member of the Tor Project, Inc.?s board of directors,
has died after a short illness. As the Tor Project wrote in a
statement [1], Caspar ?was a passionate supporter of universal human
rights, including the right to privacy?: ?The world has lost a voice of
tremendous moral courage.?
A Caspar Bowden Legacy Fund [2] has been established ?to promote
advocacy for privacy as a universal human right and privacy enhancing
technologies as one means to protect it?, in accordance with Caspar?s
request ?that we work to ensure equal protection regardless of
nationality? [3]. If you would like to make a contribution to this fund
in Caspar?s memory, please see the web page for further details.
  [1]:   [2]:   [3]: The Tor Project launches its search for a new Executive Director
Nick Mathewson put out a new release [6] in the current Tor stable
series. Version 0.2.6.10 contains a fix for a regression [7] introduced
in 0.2.6.3-alpha that made it difficult for clients to access onion
services under certain circumstances ? for example, if a hidden service
restarts after a client connects, the same client would have been unable
to connect again until the next hour. This version also ?bulletproofs
the cryptography init process, and fixes a bug when using the sandbox
code with some older versions of Linux?.
?Everyone running an older version, especially an older version of
0.2.6, should upgrade?, writes Nick. Source code is downloadable from
the distribution directory [8]; packages will become available as their
packagers package them.
  [6]:   [7]:   [8]: New onion service-related proposals
The ExoneraTor service [14] lets you use historical Tor network data to
quickly determine whether or not a particular IP address was being used
by a public Tor relay on a given date. This is useful if, for example,
you?re the administrator of a web service that received malicious
traffic on that date, and you want to find out if the IP address will be
useful to your investigation of the problem.
After much discussion and feedback on the tor-relays list [15], Karsten
Loesing and Julius Mittenzwei have updated [16] ExoneraTor to offer a
simpler, more intuitive service without unnecessary details that might
confuse a non-specialist. Searches are now restricted to full days,
rather than precise timestamps, to avoid most issues relating to
timezone differences (ExoneraTor?s results are given in UTC, and
searchers might forget to make adjustments for their local timezone);
the form allowing searchers to check whether a relay permitted exit
traffic to a target address and port has been replaced by an ?Exit?
column indicating whether or not any exit traffic was allowed by that
relay, again for the sake of simplicity; and the overall look of the
service has been streamlined, with clearer, non-technical explanations
of Tor and Exonerator, and a translation into German (with more
languages planned).
?Please give it a try, including the tricky edge cases where you expect
it to break?, wrote Karsten. ?And if you have any further feedback,?
please send it to the tor-relays mailing list.
 [14]:  [15]:  [16]: The Vegas plan continues to roll out
The upcoming IETF Meeting in Prague [17] will have a DNS Operations
meeting on 20th July [18] that will discuss both the draft proposal [19]
to reserve .onion as a special-use domain suffix (about which Tor Weekly
News has written before [20]), and other proposals for related projects
like I2P and Gnunet. If you're going to Prague, consider attending this
meeting and humming in support of reserving .onion and these other
 [17]:  [18]:  [19]:  [20]: After a hiatus in activity on the tor-mirrors list, Sebastian Hahn
updated [21] the file used to build the directory of mirrors on the Tor
Project website [22] with changes made in the last few months. ?If you
notice any unexpected entries or think you should be on the list but
aren?t, I?ll check what the problem is.?

More TSoP status reports
The Guardian Project announced new releases of Chatsecure and Orbot.
Chatsecure v14.2.0 [8] is ?all about squashing bugs, reducing memory and
improving network stability?, while Orbot 15.0.3-RC-3 [9] features
?overall improvements to system and server stability, improvements to
Apps VPN mode support?improved launch and hidden service API for
third-party app interaction?, and updates to Tor and OpenSSL.
  [8]:   [9]: Anthony G. Basile announced [10] a new release of tor-ramdisk, the micro
Linux distribution whose only  purpose is to host a Tor server in an
environment that maximizes security and privacy. Version 20150714
includes updates to the distribution?s core software.
 [10]: Nick Mathewson published proposal 248 [11] , which offers a migration
path for ?finally removing our old Ed25519 keys?.
 [11]: Following the recent outage of meek-azure [12], David Fifield published
a workaround [13] for those who want to use this backend.
 [12]:  [13]: The Tails team is planning [14] a sprint in November, possibly
face-to-face, focusing on porting Tails to the current stable release of
Debian, Jessie. ?If you want to join the fun, let me know. If you?re
interested in having a face-to-face sprint to work on this in November,
let me know. If these dates don?t work for you, let me know?, wrote
 [14]: The Intercept?s Micah Lee published a detailed beginner?s guide to
secure online chat [15], including how to configure your chat client to
use Tor.
 [15]: For those who wish the modern world looked more like ?Johnny Mnemonic?
than ?CITIZENFOUR?: you can hear Keanu Reeves narrating an unexpectedly
soothing animation [16] about the ?Deep Web? and Tor onion services as
part of Alex Winter?s upcoming documentary film on the subject [17].

@_subject: [tor-talk] love! and a question 
I'm not sure I fully understand your question, but with Tor there
is no sign-up process. You download the browser and use it just like
you use your other browsers (after having read the warnings:
Adversaries CAN steal your login credentials to other websites
(social networks, email, etc.) if you type them into a website that
does not use HTTPS encryption. This is true of all browsers,
including Tor Browser. You can usually tell if your connection is
HTTPS-protected because the address in the address bar begins with
' rather than '
I hope that helps. This is a public mailing list for discussion about
Tor's design, so if you have any other general questions about Tor see if they are covered by the FAQ:

Anthony G. Basile announced [21] version 20150531 of Tor-ramdisk, the
micro Linux distribution whose only  purpose is to host a Tor server in
an environment that maximizes security and privacy. This release updates
Tor and the Linux kernel, along with other key software.
 [21]: David Goulet announced [22] the release of Torsocks 2.1.0, featuring
support for TCP fast open, outbound localhost connections, saner warning
defaults, and more; see the changelog for full details.
 [22]: Philipp Winter added functionality [23] to sybilhunter [24], the tool
for detecting attempts to take control of a large part of the Tor
network, that produces a visualization of similarities between relay
descriptors. ?Please let me know if you have any suggestions on how to
improve the tool or its visualisation?, writes Philipp.
 [23]:  [24]: Matthew Finkel updated [25] proposal 237, which concerns making all
relays into directory servers by default, to include plans for a NotDir
consensus flag, because if the proposal is implemented, relays that do
not respond to directory requests will be more unusual (and hence more
deserving of a flag) than those that do.
 [25]: Nick Mathewson sent out a draft [26] of proposal 245, which suggests
ways to deprecate the mostly-defunct TAP circuit extension protocol
without breaking anything.
 [26]: Thomas White asked for feedback [27] (via an online survey) on his
upcoming shared onion service hosting platform: ?The priority and
thought behind the service is to enable people who aren?t usually
confident, skilled or bothered to go through the process of creating
their own hidden service, thus outsourcing the development, deployment
and maintainance?to a third party company like mine.?

Blocking-resistant communication through domain fronting
Laura Poitras, Pulitzer Prize-winning director of the Academy
Award-winning ?Citizenfour? and public advocate for Tor and Tails [4],
documented a collaboration between the Tor Project?s Jacob Appelbaum and
artist Ai Weiwei ? both of them ?artists, journalists, dissidents,
polymaths ? and targets? ? involving a ?zone of hyper-surveillance?,
shredded NSA documents, and several cuddly toy pandas.
Laura?s film is available to view on the New York Times website [5] as
part of its ?Op-Docs? series, accompanied by an article in which Laura
describes her interest in ?the way being watched and recorded affects
how we act, and how watching the watchers, or counter-surveillance, can
shift power?.
  [4]:   [5]: More monthly status reports for May 2015
Giovanni Pellerano announced [15] version 3.1.41 of Tor2web, the tool
for non-anonymous connections to onion services from regular browsers.
This version of the software allows users to download Tor Browser from
any running Tor2web instance, as well as other improvements. See
Giovanni?s message for more details.
 [15]: Donncha O?Cearbhaill published the results [16] of his call for input
from onion service operators on the challenges of running
high-performance sites and services through a Tor process.
 [16]: teor published a guide [17] to obtaining a copy of OpenSSL on Mac OS X
that is recent enough to build a working copy of Tor.

Nick Mathewson recommended [17] that all relay operators upgrade their
copies of OpenSSL to fix several issues that could enable remote
denial-of-service attacks. As Nick makes clear, this is an ?upgrade when
you can?-level announcement, rather than a ?run in circles freaking
out?. Nick also requests that people still using OpenSSL?s 0.9.8 series
upgrade to one of the more recent versions, as 0.9.8 contains several
security flaws and will not be supported by Tor 0.2.7.2-alpha or later.

Welcome to the tenth issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
Tor 0.2.6.4-rc is out
Ximin Luo announced [10] preliminary Debian packages for the meek
pluggable transport [11]. See Ximin?s message for installation
 [10]:  [11]: Sukhbir Singh announced [12] a second alpha version of Tor Messenger,
the torified instant-messaging client with multi-protocol support and
Off-the-Record encryption. While not yet ready for public use, Linux
bundles are available for developers and advanced users who want to try
out this exciting new software and provide feedback; if you run into any
new issues, open a ticket on the bug tracker [13] and select the ?Tor
Messenger? component.
 [12]:  [13]: The Tails team set out [14] the release schedule for version 1.3.1 of
the anonymous live operating system.
 [14]: For the past few years, Tor has taken part in Google?s Summer of Code
mentoring program, with many positive contributions made and several
projects launched or redeveloped as a result; this year, however, the
program has been scaled back somewhat, and longstanding participants
like the Tor Project, Mozilla, and the Linux Foundation have been
?dropped to make way for newcomers?, as Damian Johnson noted in his
monthly report [see above]. If you?d still like to join the community of
Tor developers, don?t be deterred: see the Volunteer page [15] for a
wealth of ideas for getting started.
 [15]: The British Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, ?charged
with providing independent and balanced analysis of policy issues that
have a basis in science and technology?, issued a briefing paper on the
subject of ?the darknet and online anonymity? [16].
 [16]: arm [17] is the status monitor of choice for Tor relay operators
everywhere; unfortunately, the name is easily confused with that of the
ARM processor family, so lead developer Damian Johnson is poised [18] to
change the program?s name to ?Seth?: ?Any strong reasons to pick

Welcome to the twelfth issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
Tor 0.2.4.26, 0.2.5.11, and 0.2.6.5-rc are out
Following the disclosure of two potentially serious security flaws in
Firefox, the Tor Browser team announced [5] a pointfix release of the
privacy-preserving browser. Tor Browser 4.0.5 is based on Firefox 31.5.3
ESR, fixing flaws in the handling of SVG files [6] and Javascript bounds
checking [7] that could have allowed an adversary to run malicious code
on a target machine.
This is an important security update, and all users of the stable Tor
Browser should upgrade as soon as possible. Users of the alpha Tor
Browser release channel will need to wait another week for an updated
version; in the meantime, as Georg Koppen explained, they ?are strongly
recommended to use Tor Browser 4.0.5?. Download your copy of the new Tor
Browser from the project page [8].
  [5]:   [6]:   [7]:   [8]: Tails 1.3.1 is out
Nathan Freitas announced [17] Orbot version 15-alpha-5, bringing support
for the meek and obfs4 pluggable transports, QR code bridge
distribution, and other new features closer to a stable release.
 [17]: George Kadianakis invited feedback on proposal 243 [18], which would
require Tor relays to earn the ?Stable? flag before they are allowed to
act as onion service directories, making it harder for malicious relay
operators to launch denial-of-service attacks on onion services.
 [18]: Nick Mathewson asked for comments [19] on a list of possible future
improvements to Tor?s controller protocol: ?This is a brainstorming
exercise, not a declaration of intent. The goal right now is to generate
a lot of ideas and thoughts now, and to make decisions about what to
build later.?
 [19]: David Fifield wondered [20] why many of the graphs of Tor user numbers
on the Metrics portal [21] appear to show weekly cycles.
 [20]:  [21]: Jens Kubieziel posted a list of ideas [22] for the further development
of the Torservers organization, following recent discussions.
 [22]: Mashael AlSabah and Ian Goldberg published ?Performance and Security
Improvements for Tor: A Survey? [23], a detailed introduction to the
current state of research into performance and security on the Tor
network. If you want to get up to speed on the most important technical
questions facing the Tor development community, start here!
 [23]: Aaron Johnson announced [24] that this year?s Workshop on Hot Topics in
Privacy Enhancing Technologies (HotPETS) [25] is accepting two-page talk
proposals, rather than full-length papers, in the hope that ?this will
make it even easier for more of the Tor community to participate,
especially people who don?t write research papers for a living?. If you
can offer ?new ideas, spirited debates, or controversial perspectives on
privacy (and lack thereof)?, see the Workshop?s website for submission

Tor Project, Inc. appoints Interim Executive Director
Isis Lovecruft announced [19] the release and deployment of version
0.3.2 of BridgeDB [20], the software that handles bridge address
collection and distribution for the Tor network. Notable changes include
the setting of obfs4 as the default pluggable transport served to users,
better handling of clients from the same IPv6 address block, and the
exclusion of broken bridge lines from the database.
 [19]:  [20]: Tom Ritter shared a slide deck [21] offering ?a 100-foot overview on
Tor?: ?Before I post it on twitter or a blog, I wanted to send it around
semi-publicly to collect any feedback people think is useful.?
 [21]: Moritz Bartl announced [22] the Tor-BSD Diversity Project, which aims to
mitigate the risks that the ?overwhelming GNU/Linux monoculture? among
Tor relay operators might pose to the security of the Tor network: ?In a
global anonymity network, monocultures are potentially disastrous.  A
single kernel vulnerability in GNU/Linux that impacting Tor relays could
be devastating. We want to see a stronger Tor network, and we believe
one critical ingredient for that is operating system diversity.?
 [22]: David Fifield published the regular summary of costs incurred by the
infrastructure for meek in April [23], detailing a large increase in
simultaneous users over the last month (from 2000 to 5000), and the
possible effects of a larger meek userbase on the Tor Metrics
portal?s [24] bridge user graphs.
 [23]:  [24]: John Brooks suggested [25] that, when the ?next-generation onion
services? proposal [26] is implemented, there will no longer be any
reason to use both introduction points and hidden service
directories [27] when establishing connections between Tor clients and
onion services.  Calculating introduction points in the same way that
HSDirs would be selected may have ?substantial? benefits: ?Services
touch fewer relays and don?t need to periodically post descriptors.
Client connections are much faster. The set of relays that can observe
popularity is reduced.  It?s more difficult to become the IP of a
targeted service.? See John?s proposal for a detailed explanation, and
feel free to send your comments to the tor-dev mailing list.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Question Regarding Routing of Network-Traffic using 
Hello Felix,
This is in fact a safety mechanism that Tor uses, as explained in the
above link. If your browser connected to new 'first-hop' relays every
time, there would be a greater chance that one day all the relays in
your circuit are attacking you. By picking one (or a few) guards only
and cycling them rarely, it is that much more tedious for anyone who is
waiting until you pick their bad relay in order to attack you.
Tor certainly did at one stage change its circuits after ten minutes, as
you suggest, but for various reasons this was altered, and in any case
Tor Browser itself manages circuits in a different way to the core Tor
program. It's a much-discussed question and no one yet has the perfect
If for some reason you really do need to change the guards that your
browser is using, the file to delete is called 'state', and it is under
Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor (on Linux). Generally, however, you should
not do that.
[I am not an expert on any of the above.]

in addition to unseparated ones.
 [22]: There is currently no standard definition of ?membership? in the Tor
Project, although there are various ?membership-like? features such as
internal mailing lists, LDAP accounts, and  email
addresses. Now that the Tor community is growing much more rapidly, a
discussion was held at the recent Tor dev meeting to try and come up
with some criteria against which a contributor can be categorized as a
Tor Project ?member?. Discussion is still ongoing, but a summary of the
ideas so far is available on the wiki [23].

IETF reserves .onion as a Special-Use Domain Name
Tor?s body of development proposals, documents that plan for
improvements and changes in Tor?s software ecosystem, has seen some
additions, updates, and reviews over the past week.
Nick Mathewson published proposal 256 [3], which examines methods for
revoking the long-lived public keys used by Tor relays and directory
authorities in the event that they are compromised, or the operator
believes there is a significant possibility that they have been
compromised. Andrea Shepard wrote proposal 258 [4], explaining how
directory authorities could mitigate the risk of denial-of-service (DOS)
attacks by classifying the types of directory requests they receive and
setting thresholds for each. Nick and Andrea together published proposal
257 [5], which identifies the different functions performed by directory
authorities and examines how the risk of DOS attacks could be reduced by
?isolating the security-critical, high-resource, and
availability-critical pieces of our directory infrastructure from one
George Kadianakis published a review [6] of all the open proposals
relevant to next-generation hidden services, giving a summary of each
one along with its current status, ?so that researchers and developers
have easier access to them?.
Proposal 250, which specifies how directory authorities can come up with
a shared random value every day, and which George describes as ?a
prerequisite? for all other work on next-gen hidden services, was itself
updated to reflect changes in the implementation, which is almost
finished, as David Goulet explained [7]. Finally, Tim Wilson-Brown
(teor) published a revised version [8] of the as-yet unnumbered proposal
for ?rendevous single onion services?, ?an alternative design for single
onion services, which trade service-side location privacy for improved
performance, reliability, and scalability?.
If you have any comments on these or other Tor proposals, feel free to
post your thoughts to the tor-dev mailing list.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Messenger Beta: Chat over Tor, Easily 
============================== START ==============================
karsten.n at mailbox.org:
You could try OnionShare:
TorChat (which as its developer points out is not connected with the Tor
Project in any way) last saw an update in January 2014, so unless they
presciently solved all possible bugs and exploits with their last
release, you should probably not be using it. As far as I understand,
Ricochet supersedes it entirely apart from the file-transfer aspect.
The use-case of Tor Messenger is different, as you say.

Welcome to the thirty-fourth issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the
weekly newsletter that covers what?s happening in the Tor community.
 1. Tor Browser 5.0.2 and 5.5a2 are out
 2. Final reports from two Summer of Privacy students
 3. Should cloud-based Tor relays be rejected?
 4. Miscellaneous news
 5. Upcoming events
Tor Browser 5.0.2 and 5.5a2 are out
Karsten Loesing announced [12] version 2.6 of Onionoo, the Tor network
data observatory. This release adds two new relay family-related fields
to details documents that, together with the ?effective_family? field
introduced in version 2.4, replace the older ?family? field, which is
now deprecated. These new fields support different family-mapping
use-cases that may be required by Tor network tools such as Atlas,
Globe, and Roster. ?The current ?family? field will stay available until
Atlas and Globe are updated. If I should also wait for other clients to
be updated, please let me know.?
 [12]: After several television appearances over the past few years, Tor made
its literary debut last month in the fourth installment of the late
Stieg Larsson?s Millennium series. A warm Tor community welcome to
Lisbeth Salander ? though a subscription to Tor Weekly News might clear
up some of her misconceptions? [13]

Ugh, ?facts?, how very trivial.
Thank you for the correction (and apologies to the authors who were

Introducing the tor-teachers list
Luke Millanta announced the launch of OnionView [5], a web service which
utilizes Tor relay data, gathered using the Onionoo [6] network status
protocol, to plot the location of active Tor nodes onto an interactive
map of the world. Created in collaboration with Tor?s Measurement team,
OnionView?s relay database is updated every thirty minutes to help
ensure map accuracy. Join the developers in the  IRC channel to
become involved in future work on OnionView.
