@_subject: The new translation portal 
Hi everyone,
We have decided to move the Tor translation portal over to Transifex.
All translations for the Tor Project can now be found at
 I have migrated all
existing translations for the following projects: vidalia, vidalia
help, vidalia installer, torcheck, torbutton, orbot, manual pages and
gettor. The projects torbutton-alpha and website (which refers to the
new website) are new and have not been translated yet.
You will need to register on the Transifex website before you can
start working. Once that's done, click on the file you wish to
translate, choose your language and click "Translate Now". Transifex
will allow you to lock a translation to notify others that you are
working on it. You can also download the po file, translate it offline
and upload it when you are finished.
In addition, Transifex supports automatic translations using the
Google Translate API (which currently supports 50-something
languages). If the language you are working on is supported by the
Google Translate API, you will see a yellow lightning bolt on the left
side of the text field (on mouseover).
If you have any questions, please see  or
email tor-translation at torproject.org.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Excito's B3 and TOR 
Thanks for the links. I am going to take a closer look at  this
month and I'm hoping that we'll see a usable web interface for Tor
configuration on the B3 real soon.
Let me know if you have any questions.
