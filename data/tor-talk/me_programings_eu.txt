@_subject: [tor-talk] Hidden service on Android device through Orbot 
How i can set hidden service on my rooted Android phone through Orbot?
I have kWS server running locally, and i can access what server streams on 127.0.0.1 from my web browser.
So, next i just set the server port in Orbot options, and as far as i understand, the hostname should be generated and be accessible in ".Onion hostname" field, but in my case it's not. The field is blank.
I can't find the .onion hostname for my service in order to access it.
What is wrong?

It happens with different mirrors.
I'm using an old version of Tor (0.2.5.x) for various reasons.
Obviously, most of those directory mirrors are no longer mirrors or serve directory information on different port. Why the Tor client is still trying to obtain authority certificates from them?

@_subject: [tor-talk] How stream separation across multiple circuits can be 
I'm reading the FAQ ( and i have trouble understanding the way how stream separation across multiple circuits can be implemented, in particular:
" If we can move streams across circuits, though, we would need to add queues at each end of the circuit, add sequence numbers so we can send and receive acknowledgements for cells, and so forth."
Why something like this (implementing TCP stack-like features in Tor itself) will be necessary?
