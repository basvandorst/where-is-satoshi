I running FF 3.6.8 on Linux 64 and special plugins for Tor included
Noscript 2 with the new feature and it run really well, No errors
caused and no errors in Tor logs...
So maybe your config must be wrong somewhere.

Hi James,
Tor are not made for Bitorrent, E2DK etc.... you will overload the network and don't will have any speed.
So please look about I2P or Bitblinder project for such things
