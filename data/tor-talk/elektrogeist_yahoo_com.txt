Does anyone know where I can download this tool? I can't find it anywhere. Also, how should I configure it if I am running Tor, Advanced Tor, and 3 proxies and an IP spoofer?

This is awesome!
I also found the related Winter and Lindskog China GFC/Tor analysis to
be utterly fascinating (and apparently most of you know about it, and
I don't!):
write-up: Abstract: Not only the free web is victim to China's excessive
censorship, but also the Tor anonymity network: the Great Firewall of
China prevents thousands of potential Tor users from accessing the
network. In this paper, we investigate how the blocking mechanism is
implemented, we conjecture how China's Tor blocking infrastructure is
designed and we propose countermeasures. Our work bolsters the
understanding of China's censorship capabilities and thus paves the
way towards more effective evasion techniques.

thank you for your guidance. what exactly should I run with Tor until SkypeMorph is released? I have 3 portable browsers and all 3 register different ip's when i go to  should I only run TOR and AdvancedTOR with tppFirefox and nothing else?

The short answer is that SkypeMorph is not ready for actual usage yet.
It is still at the "research project" stage.
It's great that researchers are working on alternate transports for
Tor -- and that's exactly what we had in mind when we came up with the
'modular transports' notion.
For the more technical side, you can see the discussion starting at
Holy camoley. You are very likely screwing up your anonymity with that
complex and unusual configuration.

Wow, TorBOX? Does that exist yet? That would be genius. What is the fastest VM??

Can TorBOX be of any help for your plans?
Alternative you could also combine Live amnesic host OS and Tor routing.
Live amnesic host OS + Tor routing VM + desktop VM... or...
Live amnesic host OS with Tor routing + desktop VM.
Both method have pros and cons.

VMware is fastest.
From my experience... (> means faster than)
VMware (fastest) > VirtualBox > Qemu > Bochs (slowest)
Untested: KVM, Xen
We choose VirtualBox, for reasons explained on that site.

@_subject: [tor-talk] two tors? 
How does multiple proxies interfere with the anonymity of Tor exactly? For instance, if I use a portable browser from JonDo, another portable broswer that is a PenTeser chome version, also along with a high anonymity proxy switcher and an IP spoofer. Is this over-kill? I'm not trying to hide anything really I just like privacy. Should Tor and Vidalia be the ONLY software? When I do WHOIS in each browser, they all are different IPs but non of them are my real IP. Any insight anyone?

Make sure you have all other proxy services turned off. If TOR wont start after that, go to the settings. Look for a high anonymous proxy server and manually input the address and port number. If that doesn't work, then send TOR support an email.

I haven't been able to find a fix for this problem. If it has been addressed anywhere please direct me there. I downloaded Tor and it worked fine for about 5 min. Then I restarted the computer because other things updated. After it came back on I tried to start Tor and it just says unable to start vidalia. I've tried restarting multiple times, googling the problem, searching the archives and tried to uninstall and reinstall Tor. I wasn't able to figure out how to uninstall it though. Any advice on how to fix the problem or where to look to find the answer would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
