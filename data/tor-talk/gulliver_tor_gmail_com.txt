Hi  *Caitlin*   :
If your exit policies allow an exit to the port 80 this port 80 is not the local port 80 but the remote ports 80's:
the port 80 of the web servers on which tor users established a connection...
Remote port 80:
In your firewall a rule you must allow tor.exe incomming and outgoing packets
Protocol TCP
from local ports 1024 to 5000 [1]
to remote ports 80
It's exactly like a rule for the Http access for a web browser
except this time the rule is set to tor.exe not firefox.exe for example
Local port 80:
If you have a server installed in your computer such as an Http server with Apache + MySQL + Php you must allow
 externals connection to access your local port 80...
To local port 80 from any remote ports...

*enom.com must stop hosting domain redirectors for professional criminal spam gangs*
*enom.com is hosted by Internap.  Complaints to Internap has been ignored*
*Internap must stop ignoring spam complaints about enom.com*
*E) Is it related to the "tor-proxy1.internap.com" Tor exit node ???*

@_subject: Tor and Posting To Newsgroups With A Newsreader? 
Hi  *Deacon Frost*   :
Any NNTP news reader ... This depend on your O.S.
For W xp you may use 40tude Dialog:
I'm using it also for my emails and start it with torcap:
"C:\Program Files\torcap\torcap.exe" 127.0.0.1 9050 "C:\Program Files\40tude Dialog\dialog.exe"
So all communications passed throught Tor...  ;-)
In preferences | Server, identity, signature:
identity :
you add your informations such as name, pop3 or pop3s server, smtp / smtp tls, your real email address...(for Gmane, for usenet put a false one to avoid spam !!!)
For Gmail it's :
pop3s : pop.gmail.com
port 995 SSL
+ name and password
smtp tls: smtp.gmail.com
port 587 ssl
+ name and password
NNTP server :  news.gmane.org port 119
NNTPS server : snews.gmane.org port 563
Please note that you have to suscribe to the or-talk list with NNTP
at Gmane web site before :
When you send your first Post with the NNTP client you received one email from Gmane to confirm you exist.
Answer it and it's all set !
