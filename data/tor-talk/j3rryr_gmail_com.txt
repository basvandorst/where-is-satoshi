@_subject: [tor-talk] problems with the update 
I downloaded the last update of the TBB (tor-browser-2.3.25-6_en-US.exe), and.... it keeps on telling it needs to be updated. I tried every thing (in the about:config the version is the right one, re-install it, re-download it, etc.). Is someone else having the same problem? Further more, if some one have a work around it would be much appreciated.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TorBrowser update??? 
I'm new to this list, thank you all for your work and efforts; I've been using the TorBrowser for a while now, yesterday I tried to update it (tor-browser-2.3.25-2_en-US.exe), but, the "There is a security update...." keeps showing up, I already downloaded it twice, and couldn't fix it. Is there something I can do? Or another download site?
Thanks in advance,

In the old one, but I deleted every thing first; some thing wired happened thou, when I changed the location of the folder the problem In the about:config appeared the right version
I don't know why, but when I rebooted the pc the problem disappeared (it's normally turned on) - I use W7 X64, may be the problem was OS/explorer related. Thanks!!!

Thanks Moritz, even after this email the problem continued, it disappeared when I rebooted the pc (it was up for several days till yesterday), it also disappeared if the folder was on a different location (before the reboot).
Great, finally moving on from FF10!!!

@_subject: [tor-talk] problems with TorBirdy 
I know this is a list for Tor-related issues, but I hope to get a answer for a problem with TorBirdy at Thunderbird and the last update for the TorBrowser. Well, it doesn't work - the torrc now uses the "SocksPort 9150", I changed the TH to the configuration recommended in
And used this port - instead of the 9050 - and it worked. I know it's a poor solution, and I was wondering if it can be fixed at the ConfigEditor of the TH - an update on TorBirdy could be great thou, but I think the fix  can do the trick.
Thanks in advance,
PS: I also tried to change the value of the socks port in the TH config - from 9050 to 9150 - with no results.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Proxy Problem? 
I'm having the same problem with this update (and the change of port & TorBirdy is another issue), and I'm using that option unchecked, the only - temporary, in time it doesn't work either - solution is to completely delete the TBB folder and extract it again (I'm using it on W7 x64)
Best Regards,
