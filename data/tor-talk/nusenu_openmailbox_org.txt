Hash: SHA512
by looking at
I noticed a little spike in relays at the beginning of the month
(actually I was visiting metrics to see if some ticket made progress ;)
On 2015-04-01 someone (it was likely a single entity) signed up 20
exits @ Choopa LLC. If you go back in time on that AS you find similar
events. So this potential entity might run 40 exits.
If you condense all properties and do not restrict your search to the
Choopa AS (AS20473) the potential operator likely runs 55 exits.
Fun part: Maxmind had no AS info on some IPs (4) that are also part of
AS20473, so they got filtered out in the first result set where I only
looked into AS20473 (40 relays), but these relays found there way back
into the result set (55 relays) on the next iteration due to other
similarities. So I'm pretty confident in the linkability of these exit
Common properties:
(ordered from more to less significant property)
- - *last_restarted*
- - first_seen (in groups)
- - DirPort (auto)
- - Nickname (not matching put similar naming style)
- - exit policy
- - no declared family
- - ORPort
- - two instances per IP
- - no contactInfo
- - tor version
- - os
Can someone make some sense out of these nicknames?

Thanks for your effort.
- From a "customer" perspective I'm missing some crucial information on
your website:
- - what bandwidth (mbps or TB per month) does this relay add to the
network? (I understand that it is hard to estimate but if the data
plan allows only lets say 1TB per month you should make that clear)
- - am I adding an exit or non-exit relay?
More experienced "customers" might want to know:
- - What characteristics has the relay? how much memory?
- - Where are you going to run the sponsored relay?
- - What OS are you going to use? (apparently Linux)
- - Can I select location/OS/bw/.. ?
- - Do you provide bw monitoring and traffic stats? (i.e. munin and vnstat

I understand that you might want to keep this website simple since you

I hope you also consider the following points:
- - proper automatic MyFamily configuration on all your relays
- - keep your relays up to date
- - network and platform diversity (this becomes more relevant once you
run a substantial part of the tor network)
Do you "pre-run" relays and rename them as soon as they are "ordered"
to reduce the bootstrap phase?

I guess you actually mean 1000 GB (=1TB)...?
You definitely should consider going somewhere with unmetered traffic,
since 1TB / month isn't a lot. The relay will hit the cap fast and
won't run for most of the month? IMHO this model doesn't scale well
with digital ocean's pricing.
You would be able to achieve a far bigger impact if you crowd source
bigger unmetered instances.. where you add an instance per sponsor.
Obviously that has to be transparent to the sponsor.
Do you have experience with running relays on 512MB of RAM?
given the limited available memory you probably don't want to run two
You don't want to manage more than a hand full of relays without
central management. "never actually login" is IMHO not very realistic

certainly better use of the sponsor's money than running 1TB/month

Some more ideas for you, in case you continue your project:
Lets say you find a suitable hosting provider that fulfills your
automation requirements and offers reasonable unmetered instances but
might be to costly for a single sponsor.
Instead of "offering" relays (only) - that, depending on the actual
price, might represent a high entry barrier - you could "offer" tor
network capacity. That is actually what matters.
Every sponsor can support X mbps of the next upcoming relay for a
year, once the next relay is financed you can fire it up. If the
sponsor wants his own tor instance name he has to provide for at least
1/2 of the relay cost (if you run lets say two tor instances per server)
Such an approach could lower the entry barrier for potential sponsors.
(You will probably want to limit the minimal amount to some reasonable
Regarding requirements for automation (hosting provider), I guess
these are the minimal
- - automatic order submission (I assume payment is taken care of
automatically by charging the account's credit card)
- - get the IP address of the new server
- - pre authorized SSH public key on every new server
Ansible could take care of the rest.
It doesn't have to be a human.

So you do not think that they are controlled by the same (malicious)
entity? (even though some declare their MyFamily accordingly*)
Or is the requirement to flag them as badexit to catch them red handed?
The case that one took over legit relays is unlikely since many are
rather 'fresh' ones.
Or: Are they still on the network so we can see what they are after? ;)
(rather hard given the amount of potential targets)
Did you (or anyone else?) try to reach out to them via their ISP(s)?
*) Why would a malicious entity start to declare a MyFamily at all?
I guess due to my email from
ml and it does not actually hurt their malicious activities because
the little groups are in the same /16 anyway. (They do not put all
their relays in a family)

I would appreciate to hear your thoughts on the MyFamily group [2].
Lets make sure that we are on common ground regarding the following
- - you saw their (speaking about the 55 relays [1]) sign up timing/pattern
- - you saw their restart timing/pattern
- - the combination of these two
- - you saw that all of them changed their DirPort setting after [1]
 - relay: Chifuniro (BadExit)
 - relay: Kyriakos + 3 others (no BadExit flag)
both signed up on 2015-04-01 within a two hours timeframe
both restarted on 2015-04-04 within a 11 seconds timeframe
other matching properties:
Now to actually weight the information above one would have to compare
that with the rest of the network. How likely is it that something
like this happens coincidentally? I didn't do the actual processing
but I'd say the likelihood is low.
Anyway, it is good that relays are not flagged to easily as BadExits.
[1] [2] Is that a reason to *not* flag them as BadExit?
I mentioned the sentence above (compromising legit relays) since that
would/should influence the decision whether a group of relays operated
by one entity should be treated as 'bad' if one behaves 'bad'.
Thanks for doing this, keep us posted.
(I was also about to ask the hoster whether some IPs relate to the
same customer but I'll leave it to you then.)
Why is that odd? I thought that is good as it makes detection
potentially easier if bad guys use just a single or few ISPs, no?

some BSD related things from the top of my head:
- - metrics ticket to merge all *BSDs in the platform graphs:
so we can better measure the actual impact.
Unfortunately we do not have BW or CW fraction graphs (more relevant
than relaycount) on metrics but I added a snapshot of platform CW
distribution in that ticket.
That was one of the reasons I started ansible-relayor.
OpenBSD 5.7 (to be released on 2015-05-01) comes with rcctl, that made
multi-instance support very easy.
FreeBSD is less optimal in that regard, but FreeBSD's tor port
maintainer said he will look into the planed (Nov 2015) FreeBSD
multi-instance support of rc.d [1] - which then could also be used by
the tor port.

The advertised bw should not really matter when we have bwauths
providing measurements, no?
So lets have a look at what measurements they provided here.
Example: consensus 2015-12-10 14:00:00 [1]
relay PhantomTrain6 had a consensus weigh of: 2150000
(that implies that the median of bwauth measurements is 2150000 or
longclaw measured: 2150000
maatuska measured: 1280000
moria1 measured:   2150000
gabelmoo no measurment
Faravahar no measurement
tor's definition of the median of 1280000 2150000 2150000
is: 2150000 (correct)
so the actual question is:
Why do bwauth come to such measurement results?

@_subject: [tor-talk] understanding client side enforced families 
Hash: SHA512
I'd like to properly understand the implications of tor's 'NodeFamily'
config option and if there is a DirAuth enforcable config option
similar to this client side option (something I did not find in the
man page yet).
names convention I'm using in this email
* undeclared family
a confirmed (by the operator) or likely group of relays operated by a
single entity or group
* declared family
a family defined by the list of fingerprints a given relay publishes
in the family line of its descriptor (for simplicity we assume there
are only fingerprints and ignore everything else).
* effective family
the overlapping list of fingerprints between declared family and
mutually agreed relationships. The effective family might be smaller
(in terms of element count) or equal but never bigger than the
declared family.
* client family
family defined by the list of fingerprints configured on a tor client
via 'NodeFamily'
* real effective family
the set of fingerprints considered to be in family after evaluating
effective families and NodeFamily torrc config lines
I assume a tor client becomes more unique as soon as he uses the
NodeFamily option but this "uniqueness" is expected to be hardly
measurable as long as NodeFamily is used reasonably (and the risks of
using multiple relays from a given undeclared family are expected to
be greater than this newly introduced uniqueness).
- - Is it possible to (accidentally) reduce the size (by element count)
of a real effective family by using NodeFamily or is the real
effective family size always the bigger of size(effective family) and
size(client family)?
effective family is: A, B, C, D
NodeFamily (accidentally) is: A, B
What is the resulting real effective family?
1) real eff. family = A, B, C, D
2) 	real eff. fam1 = A, B;
- - Is it possible to (accidentally) create real effective families by
using NodeFamily that are bigger than size(effective family) or
size(client family)? (That implies that client families have the power
to link multiple families into one even though the client family only
lists a subset of thouse.)
eff. family1 = A, B, C
eff. family2 = B, C, D
A and D are not in the same family, is this still true after setting
NodeFamily: B, C
NodeFamily: A, B

@_subject: [tor-talk] Who runs the Tor Network? An Overview using MyFamily Data 
Hash: SHA512
currently we use globe [1] compass [2] or old school torstatus [3] to
get an overview of what relays are around and who might operate them.
None of these 'tools' provide an easy way to aggregate relay data to
have a look at the bigger picture (Who runs most of the tor network?).
I generated* a preliminary overview based on MyFamily data, that
should provide an overview of the big tor relay operators:
(Only the top 15 have names next to them because that was a manual task ;)
In the future that table might just be another compass checkbox saying
"Group by MyFamily" (or a static page generated once an hour).
Note: If you compare this with other overviews that uses contactInfo
to aggregate relays
you will notice some big operators are missing. That means that they
are not using MyFamily (properly).
Also because MyFamily is a cumbersome setting for relay operators
there might be misconfigurations** that result in multiple
(overlapping) families.
Positive side effect: By using MyFamily to aggregate relays, I hope to
creating incentives for relay operators to actually configure MyFamily
on their relays. MyFamily avoids using multiple relays - operated by a
single entity - in a single tor client circuit.
Also, relay ops running many "smaller" relays hopefully will become
more visible (and receive more acknowledgments for their
contributions) [4].
If you are a relay operator yourself, you can easily check if you
configured your relays properly by entering any of your relay
fingerprints on  (family field). If the
search result does not show all your relays then there is something
wrong with your MyFamily configuration.

was talking about. It would just sum up all relays of a family, and

*) basically compass -f in a loop has been used to generate that overview.
I also required at least two members in a Family - which is a bad idea
because you will "loose" single big relays like IPredator - this will
be changed.

Actually there is no such thing as a 'family ID'.
This is not something you will find in relay descriptors or consensus
I just named it this way, but the more accurate name would probably be
"Fingerprint of a relay that is part of this family".
It is just an arbitrary relay fingerprint of a relay in the given
family, but you can use that fingerprint to easily identify all family
members by using it on compass (or via the -f option on the command
line). So to some extend you could say this is an ID, but a family
might have several IDs - as many as family members.

For simplicity reasons probably, but I don't see any reason why a tor
client would have a problem with that? And the group-by family
analysis has no problem with it either. If this kind of MyFamily
configuration is intended by the operators than it is no
misconfiguration by design.
Just in most cases it probably is. For clarity reasons it would be
great if 'organizational' relays (d,e,f) would have distinct
contactInfo (compared to personal relays (a,b,c).
I hope it will be replaced by prop 242.

@_subject: [tor-talk] badfamilies: searching for undeclared families 
Hash: SHA512
(if you are on CC you might want to jump to the URL and have a look at
your relays' MyFamily config)
as a tor client one probably doesn't wish to use relays from one
entity only when creating circuits. So it might make sense to find
undeclared families.
This first very simple approach uses contactInfo data to detect
myfamily misconfiguration - so it detects potential families that are
not "hiding" on purpose.
The last column shows the number of relays which have the given
contact string and the 3th column shows the number of family members
this relay has (in a perfect setup these numbers match).
This is obviously a non-perfect approach and might contain false
positives since everyone can set a contactInfo string on his relay as
he wishes.
Should this list worry you?
The two biggest undeclared families (by relay count) - perfect-privacy
& torpids run relays in over 30 distinct /16 netblocks but they don't
seem to run any exits which makes it currently impossible to create
exiting circuits through them exclusively.
torservers.net on the other hand seems to have a current guard
probability of 0% according to compass, but as one can see in the
atlas graphs that is not always the case. Additionally torservers runs
only in 8 distinct /16 netblocks. I guess the odds are low for one to
create a circuit through torservers only - depending on your currently
selected guard node.

I heard about a few of them an know that some are using central
management tools to keep MyFamily in sync: ansible or puppet. That is
probably the reason why they are in good shape.
The good news is that at least one of the big operators not having
perfect MyFamily setup yet might start using a central management as well.
Looking forward to find actually hiding families aka (slow) sibyl
attacks ;)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Are squid proxies acceptable on exit nodes? 
Exit relays should not route their traffic through transparent proxies
because that causes problems when TCP ports are not used for the usual
protocols and also generates more logs then there should be.
Also they seem to have timeouts a lot, where other exits are able to
deliver the same sites without problems (maybe their squid is overloaded?).
This one is also using a squid proxy and it is likely operated by the
same entity (see last restart timestamp):
unfortunately we can not ask them if they or their upstream is running
squid since they have no ContactInfo set.
Please consider giving them the badexit flag.
you might also want to have a look at other exits on that AS to find out
if their upstream is running squid.

@_subject: [tor-talk] OT: twitter account vs. phone number 
even though this is not directly about Tor I'm asking this question here
because I assume there are many privacy-conscious people on this list
and maybe someone has a solution for this privacy problem - or some
contact at twitter ;)
(I'm also CC'ing Kate due to a recent news article [1] about the Tor
Project being in contact with Twitter about becoming more
tor-friendly, maybe the phone number requirement can be brought up there
as well).
Also the Tor Project seems to (indirectly) create incentives to use
twitter (with accounts) by requesting DMs if someone wants to get more
details about something [2].
Why would someone have a problem sharing its phone number with twitter?
maybe there is no phone? or maybe the attack surface should be kept at a
minimum by not sharing the phone number with twitter so no one can steal
it from them [3]?
Using google voice numbers for verification [4] does not work
because creating a google account requires also a phone number in the
first place.
Using random SMS receive websites [5] does not work either because these
numbers are usually already used by other twitter accounts and you might
not like giving your twitter account to some random website by using
their number.
Trying to reach out to twitter support seems also pointless since that
is apparently a bot only.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor-ramdisk and ansible-relayor 
I like the idea of running tor servers on tor-ramdisk powered minimal
machines and would like to add tor-ramdisk support to ansible-relayor [1].
That would require a SSH server and python 2,
is there a chance that is going to be included in future releases?

just because something is on a wiki hosted on tpo it is not necessarily
endorsed or recommended by the Tor Project in any way.
And since you experienced problems with mail.ru you can easily move it
from the "good" section to the other section - it is a wiki after all..

@_subject: [tor-talk] Guard Selection 
Depending on what tor version you are interested in you might also look
at prop 271 [1].
From the changelog of 0.3.0.1-alpha:
  o Major features (guard selection algorithm):
    - Tor's guard selection algorithm has been redesigned from the
      ground up, to better support unreliable networks and restrictive
      sets of entry nodes, and to better resist guard-capture attacks by
      hostile local networks. Implements proposal 271; closes
      ticket 19877.

@_subject: [tor-talk] State of bad relays (March 2017) 
Thanks for this email.
I hoped tor directory authorities would care [1] about tor relay groups
with end-to-end capabilities as much as about HSDirs.
(this list is truncated)
(even though they might not be intentionally malicious;
yes contactinfo can be arbitrarily forged)
I think an actual step to help protect tor users and to improve the
current situation is to implement proposal 242 (better families) [2]
followed by a stricter enforcement of it by dir auths (unlikely to happen).
Proposal 242 reduces the burden from tor relay ops when running more
than one relay and hopefully decreases the number of undeclared families
that put users at risk because they potentially see traffic entering
_and_ leaving the tor network (which breaks the assumption that not
every relay in a circuit is operated by the same operator).
Even with prop 242 available in a released tor version its usefulness
depends on the actual adoption by relay ops, something that is hard to
but implementing prop242 certainly scales better than contacting every
tor relay operator that does not set MyFamily (properly).
