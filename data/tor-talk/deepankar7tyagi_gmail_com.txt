Hi everyone!,
I recently finished my GSOC project in which I ported Tor codebase to
chrome's native client (also ported libevent).
This enables tor's official C codebase to run inside Chrome browser as an
app, it creates a system wide (tor)socks proxy at port 9999.
The app has been published on webstore ( all relevant links are at end of
Currently it lacks a functional GUI ie ability to add proxy settings,
modify proxy port etc; I am working on it and next version will have one.
Any feedback and suggestions are welcome.
(Apologies if I sent the mail to wrong mailing list)

separate and simplified repo soon)

Currently, sometimes post build test fail when compiled against some NaCl
I have de - prioritized that issue for now, in order to focus on making app
user friendly, once all small quirks are sorted out, will send a pull
