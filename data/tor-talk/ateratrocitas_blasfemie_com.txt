Through a link on the frontpage of the Tor wiki you can find a link [1]
to some artwork, including a sticker design [2] .. I have no idea
whether it has been actually made.
Additionally I'd like to add that I would prefer some general Tor
merchandise, even a lame CafePress store (like [3] ) will do. Are there
plans for such a thing? I know a T-shirt is available [4], but I'm sure
I'm not the only one who'd like to see additional merchandise.

I'm not too sure... their privacy policy is not too convincing in my

Besides, if it's the shortcuts you like: Firefox already has those built
in... (  )
This is all aside from whether you could use this with Tor. As far as I
know you should be able to use OpenDNS with Tor, since DNS lookups are
still not performed by Tor by default and have to be manually routed
through Tor. (

Still, I'd never use OpenDNS because of the possible or at least
theoretical unneeded privacy risk and the fact that keyword shortcuts
are already present in Firefox. But that's just my two cents.

Then again, you can also just get Vidalia installed under Gnome. In a
few of the larger distro's it should just be in portage, or the
repository, whatever your distribution has called it's package database.
If it's not present there, go here:

Even though it isn't the most recent posting, it does not seem all to
hard in this howto:
(Ubuntu Edgy Eft, QT, Tor, Vidalia)
Installing on previous Ubuntu version 6.06 LTS does not seem that
simple: Don't know whether the whole Tor 0.1.2.16 release and it's control port
management has changed the installation on Ubuntu though, here on Gentoo
I'll have to first fix getting a new Vidalia ebuild as the previous
Vidalia does not work with the newest Tor.
