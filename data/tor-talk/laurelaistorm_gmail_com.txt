@_subject: [tor-talk] New relays and bridges. 
Since some folks have declined to offer their services in this department i
thought it might be a good idea to start outreach to get more bridges and
relays setup. Ill be setting one up myself and encouraging others to do the
same across various platforms.

This is the most people unaware, human behavior unaware feature to come out
of programming since they made logging default on for OTR+Pidgin. This is
just begging for sites to be even more insecure than they are already.
Which is exactly why you should have this feature as it is. You say its
insulting to users, we say the actual reality of the situation is that
people use TOR who arent computer experts and sane defaults are a needed
thing, to help keep people safe. Dissidents and vulnerable people use this
service, you cant expect them all to be experts and you cant treat them
like they are, because they arent.
This is pants on head stupid. Fix it.
