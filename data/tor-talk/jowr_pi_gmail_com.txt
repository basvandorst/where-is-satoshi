That's what *slays* me about this.
On one hand I think its' great to have a tor hidden service for
facebook as there are legitimate use cases for it.
On the other, the juxtaposition of the least privacy-sensitive tool in
the WORLD against tor is a contrast that damn near hurts to look at.
This will be a continual source of amusement for me, but maybe
something of value will come out of this.

To that end, I setup a bitcoin node that listens on the v4/v6 internet as
well as tor.
The hidden service address is dsyadrvivtt34s26.onion
Could some folks please test this for me and make sure it works for others?
I can see it is quite happily running on v4/v6 (and getting traffic) but
its' less obvious that it is working over tor.

...and this is precisely why I asked! The documentation on setting up a
bitcoin node is very....sparse, so I had to guess.
This is my current bitcoin configuration:
Since it has been indicated that this doesn't work, I am adding this:
...as well.
The documentation indicated that tor= was the right answer, but mebbie not.
Nothing has indicated I am unable to run a node that listens on tor as well
as the public internet. I am not abundantly concerned about the anonymnity
of the bitcoin node which is why I'll run as all three.
Also I've noticed that tor is most certainly the... alpha partner in
bandwidth consumption:
iptables OUTPUT chain, zeroed at the same time:
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source
1187M 1371G TOR        tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0
0.0.0.0/0            owner UID match 103 /* 100-v4 tor outgoing traffic */
8643K 7662M ACCEPT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0
0.0.0.0/0            owner UID match 109 /* 101-v4 bitcoin outgoing traffic
It looks like I'll have to tinker with the onion stuff a bit. A twenty
dollar/month dedicated server lets me do a lot of tinkering and some
community service!

Please don't use OpenDNS. They insert ads into lookups.

Oh, have they finally stopped putting ads into NXDOMAIN results after
years of ignoring requests to do so?

Ooooooh, fascinating.
The academic paper is interesting and covers the high points of the
type of things you would want to look for. And some things you
wouldn't think that you should, like connection sampling rather than
binary "is sniffing" / "is not sniffing". (ha ha, n^2 fuckup)
Looking at the exitmap source, as I was curious what modules
existed....the problem I see is that it does not have modules that are
capable of the more difficult to pull off things like SSH honeypot
Should have called the damn thing "inverse-metasploit".
The idea is solid but the implementation has to keep up with the
times. Specific attack vectors like
CVE-2014-3566 (or any other sort of TLS/SSL downgrade attack) need to
be tested for, and all that. Which makes the "inverse-metasploit"
notion all the more compelling.
Other things come to mind like testing for binary patching (eg, ninja
exe patching).
Some of these things are easier to detect than others.
I'm going to put a pin in this and think about it.

It's a bit late, but I can answer the question.
Replace the word "implant" with "rootkit" or "backdoor", and things
make a lot more sense.

I can read too. The point is Russia has put out large dollar figures
for this before and I wouldn't be surprised if they did it again.
