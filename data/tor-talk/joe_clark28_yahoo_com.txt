@_subject: Exclude and Exit nodes 
Dear TOR Users:
  I'm having some difficulties with TOR seemingly simple rules.
  I've added the ExcludeNodes, ExitNodes and StrictEXitNodes 1 rules to my torrc file.
  After adding those rules I connected to the control port and by using the "GETINFO circuit-status" command I noticed TOR built circuits which are not according to my aforementioned rules...
  what did I do wrong?
  **I use TOR v0.1.1.21.
  Thanking you in advance,
  Joe.

Hi everybody,
  This is my first message to or-talk so I hope I did it all right...
  and to my question:
  I added the ExcludeNodes rule to the torrc file with some nodes I don't want TOR to build a circuit with.
  After adding this rule I connected to the control port and by using the "GETINFO circuit-status" command I noticed TOR built circuits using routers I didn't want it to use...
  what did I do wrong?

@_subject: Fetching Directory File 
Dear Tor Users,
  Is it possible to fetch the directory file through TOR using the 'HttpProxy host[:port]' option? (lets say like this: HttpProxy 127.0.0.1:8118)
  *8118 - the privoxy's port.
  Thanks,
  Joe.

First of all, thanks !
  You're saying to not rely on the cached-routers file (name and format), so what can I rely on as a list of all routers?
  this:
    or maybe this: (notice that this is by the old format)
    ?
  Thanks!,
  Joe.
The directory protocol is described at
Indeed you did. The old protocol is at
The storage format is undocumented, and intentionally so: we may
change it without warning, so please don't rely on it. But basically,
the old format was just to store a raw directory to disk. The new
format is to store a network status document for each authority in a
file named cached-status/ (with the authority's
fingerprint given in hex); and to store the router descriptors
concatenated in cached-routers and cached-routers.new. The latter is
append-only, and used as a journal; periodically, we prune out unused
router descriptors and regenerate cached-routers.
The source (in routerlist.c) should have full information.

Dear TOR users:
  I got a pretty newbie question to you guys:
  From where does TOR client take its routers' database ?
  In v-0.1.0.17 it was a file called "cached-directory". I upgraded to v-0.1.1.23 and I noticed some changes in the filename ("cached-routers" ?!) and in the file format.
  I'd be grateful if someone could clarify this issue to me...
  Thanks!,
  Joe.

I don't want to be rude, but please answer my little question.
