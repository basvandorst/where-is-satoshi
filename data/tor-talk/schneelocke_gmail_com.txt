That really depends. I think I recall that the network connecting
german universities (the DFN) was switched from a "pay a flat fee for
your access" to a traffic-based price model some years ago - I'm not
sure if that's still what things are like, but if yes, then
universities are probably going to be less tolerant of high-traffic
applications like that, especially if they don't benefit from them
