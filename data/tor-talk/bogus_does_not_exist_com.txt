Tor creates several circuits while operating as a hidden service. Does it connect to several entry points at the same time while doing all this, or does it create all these circuits trough one selected entry for a given time?
It also states on that info page:
"At this point it is of special importance that the hidden service sticks to the same set of entry guards when creating new circuits."
Tor does this by default, or should you edit the torrc file and add just a few entry nodes that you use all the time?
How many entry nodes are Tor switching between by default anyway?
Thanks for any help!

that a certain portion of the legal community feels
that NSL's are not, in fact, legal/constitutional... and
they are awaiting a good test case before presenting
that question.
It would seem prudent for an ISP or node op to be quite
concerned about following any demand that was not
signed by a judge having jurisdiction... mostly to avoid
doing anything that could later become a criminal or
civil liability for them. Such as say installing and operating
a wiretap under the guise/authority of such an extrajudicial
letter or demand. For that reason alone, it would seem
wise to seek review of any such thing before blindly
producing or performing work.
Note also that federal, state and even most county
jurisdictions have 24hr judges on call, plus the FISA
court for particularly sensitive 'national security' issues.
ianal, call one :)

time when the tarball is available opposed to the point in time when all
packages and bundles are available. Mentioning the fact that packages
and bundles will follow (in the next few days?) should be enough?
This way the window of exposure in case of security fixes is smaller and
people can prepare/plan for an upgrade or stop the Tor process till they
completed the upgrade if it should contain critical vulnerabilities.
(Assuming the bad guys know about security related fixes as soon as the
change hits the git repo.)
I think this topic boils down to the question:
'Is it better to announce a release shortly before or after it is
I think it is better to know about a release shortly before it is
available, also if this means that user need to 'poll' the download

"Clients can now use microdescriptors instead of regular descriptors
     to build circuits. Microdescriptors are authority-generated
     summaries of regular descriptors' contents, designed to change
     very rarely (see proposal 158 for details). This feature is
     designed to save bandwidth, especially for clients on slow internet
     connections. It's off by default for now, since nearly no caches
     support it, but it will be on-by-default for clients in a future
     version. You can use the UseMicrodescriptors option to turn it on."
So the option 'UseMicrodescriptors 1' means that you turn it on.

more than Abramovich, so I doubt he'd have any interest from income in
the show-biz! ;)) And in case anyone's interested, rutracker.org most
likely puts suprnova, mininova, pirate bay etc to shame with the amount
of content it tracks, very usable with Google Chrome/auto-translate! ;))
As long as government is calling for Tor and other
encryption/anonymizing solutions to be banned, it means that we're on
the right track, and that it's still too expensive/time consuming for
them to crack it (if at all possible)!
It's much easier to arrest someone for using VPN, like in Pakistan, or
to force someone to hand over the passwords to your keys, like in the
UK, than to hack it!
I know about the crackdown on LiveJournal, but never knew that it was
bought out by SUP... I thought it was still American (and that that's
why it couldn't be shut down by FSB)?!
No one ever 'permits' spying, it just happens ;)
Tor goes a long way towards solving that problem, but it's not immune.
If the FSB can see all traffic going into the network through the SORM
system, and then filter out everything but the Tor traffic, and then
correlate that with some bogus exit nodes it sets up around the world,
it's not impossible to imagine they have the ability to correlate
traffic that goes in and traffic that goes out...
This is why Tor should only be your first line of defence - any e-mail
or other potentially-sensitive information should only be sent over
Another thing - knock on wood - you and your friends might not be
"interesting" enough to the authorities to come after... You may be
opposed to Putin and Medvedev, but then again, so are a lot of Russians,
their ratings have been going down the toilet over the last few years.
I can imagine them doing a lot of things, becoming more authoritarian
and draconian, but I'd argue that Stalin-style raids about as likely in
the US or UK
as in Russia!
Like I said, knock on wood, so far there's no indication that they would
go that far, and such a crackdown would be really bad news for its
rapidly developing economy... It's impossible to go back to Stalinist
control without blocking Internet, TV, radio, computers, mobile phones,
killing 20 million people and taking the country back to the dark ages!

As of svn commit 25130 we no longer have our web pages translated. We
continue to translate tor, vidalia, aurora/firefox, our manual pages,
and other documentation included with the various bundles. We're also
going to create a new, simplified user manual that can be translated
and included in our various packages.
I thank our translators, both past and current, and continue to be
impressed at the community we've built up around translating all
things Tor. We appreciate it, our users appreciate, and I appreciate
Why did we do this?
- We spend a lot of time managing the translated pages on the website.
- The English pages are frequently updated, thereby invalidating all
of the other languages.
- The switch to Transifex hasn't made more translators appear,
especially for the languages we may care about the most.
- The translators for many languages that have a right-to-left
orientation complain that the transifex interface is a nightmare to
use and refuse to update.
- Lots of users simply use google translate, or read English anyway.
- Getting translated software into the hands of people is more
important than them reading our web pages (especially if the
documentation is translated and available locally)
- Our translations for right to left languages, such as Arabic and
Farsi, were growing out of date and required far more technical skill
to do than more translators are capable of handling. This involved
editing the raw perl templating system we used.
- And, according to our webserver logs, our translated website traffic
is less than 2% of total GET requests, nevermind page views.
We may go back to the old model, which was svn or git commits directly
to the repository for translations. It seemed this model attracted a
few dedicated translators for some interesting languages. These
languages were always kept current with the English pages. Another
option is automated translation, such as something Bayesian that
understands the difference between the snack cookie and a web browser
If you have suggestions or other ideas how to improve our
translations, feel free to respond to ticket I still look forward to universal translators, helping me to
understand the polyglot Internet. There is so much content out there
that isn't in languages I understand. I hope universal translators can
greatly improve in a short time.

text can be stolen though JavaScript"
And from the short paragraph right under the BIG box containing
katmagic's sample exploit code: "A similar approach should also work
for stealing a plaintext written in a text box before it's encrypted."
This sounds like a feature that someone who understands how to write
secure Firefox extensions might be able to implement safely.  Make
sure whoever implements it warns users that files' names will be sent
in the clear, because they will be sent in the clear (and/or exposed
to JavaScript).
Asking the user for permission does not block many attacks, even if
the user understands the implications of granting permission to
perform a GPG operation.
XUL is the reason Firefox has so many code-exec bugs.  It would be
easier and safer to ship one of the existing GPG key management GUIs
written using a real GUI toolkit.
No code coming from the web needs to interact with the GPG plugin in
order to grab the plaintext of a GPG message.
I think you've found a feature (encryption of files to be uploaded)
which could be implemented securely, and which might actually be
useful to a few users.  I'm not convinced that feature is worth the
trouble of implementing and auditing a browser extension that would
provide it.

sentient warm body directly to you though. But we are running in circles
here don't you think ;)
The only difference is that for your hardened box it is way more
expensive (your hardware+hosting costs money and gmail costs nothing),
very noticeable as being 'special' as you likely don't share it too much
with others and especially not the 'sheep' that are so good to hide
traffic in.
Yes, your setup will be way more secure, but at which cost and to
protect exactly what?
The original thread & threat point was about 'is gmail safe for email',
where my point was 'if you do GPG then they can only see the src/dst
email address' (and obviously other SMTP headers).
Your threat point seems to be to safeguard every single bit at a very
high price, while that is completely valid, that is not for everybody
The fact that you will have such a hardened box is already easily
noticeable and it will cost you a lot too.
The gmail + PGP setup is free, and if they compromise one, well, just
set setup a new one. Heck, jump to Yahoo or GMX or every other one.
You are clearly thinking of hiring one, I guess you need one too.
Note that I am not a security consultant in any way, thus I can't help
you with even if you wanted me to.
Ever considered that you are the one who diverted completely from the
original subject? ;) I'll skip over the even more silly bits which have
no technical merit at all.
And then there is a cable between the UPS and your hardened box, that
cable can be clamped too. Or did you cement that all in? :)
Must be an awesome datacenter that nobody ever approaches that rack of
Difficult and very expensive. I don't think that is what people who just
want to have a bit of privacy for their email want to go all the way for.
Every 10 year old who watched a silly movie can come up with that one.
Right back at ya! ;)
So you mean you don't use E-mail at all and everybody is using the same
crypto system as you, or they drop "mail" all on that hardened box?
Is an option, not very workable on a large scale, especially when you
introduce more people to use that system as then the trust system starts
breaking down.
Thanks for the tip! Fortunately I am a completely drug-free person.
Everybody their own thing.
Obviously your threat model is a lot more paranoid than that of the
original message.
Always good to hear that I don't run any, then I don't have anything to
worry about that either ;)

* Recognized line formats are:

 * and
 *   "INTIPLOW","INTIPHIGH","CC","CC3","COUNTRY NAME"
 * where INTIPLOW and INTIPHIGH are IPv4 addresses encoded as 4-byte
 * integers, and CC is a country code.
Thus for instance 123.45.67.0 becomes:
$ printf "%02x %02x %02x %02x\n" 123 45 67 0
7b 2d 43 00
Thus 0x7b2d4300 which is in decimal:
$ printf "%d\n" 0x7b2d4300
Thus to convert them back:

The policy of Tor is that node operators should not violate people's privacy.
My personal opinion, additionally, is that by signing up a node on the
Tor network, an operator is offering people a service that they hope
to use in order to enhance their privacy.  Anybody who offers people
privacy and then deliberately invades that privacy is, in my opinion,
a liar, and worse than a liar.  Such a person would be betraying the
very people who came to them for help.

webproxysite-1.net will be able to quickly tell which client initiator
and responding server are on the same circuit and know what you are
doing. This has long been recognized in theory and simulation, and
more recently experimentally shown on the Tor network for some cases.
But worse, s/he doesn't need to be malicious or the site be
compromised.  An external attacker just watching the network
connection of webproxysite-1.net can do the same attack about as
well. The second case thus reduces to the security of a single hop

*probe*, because I wanted to see--and indeed I have: maybe I now have a better
idea on who you are.)
There are m banal explanations for the typo: done 2008 - 2001 mentally ...
then just [mentally] picked the wrong digit, and typed ... eight instead
seven. (Here, where I am replaying, there are *routine* blackouts daily
since months: 4-6-10-12 hours a day; it makes one behave the *saccadic* and
*incremental* way a bit.)
I regard the readers as intelligent, and imagine that they can do by
themselves the necessary corrections here and there. Good that you likely
can't read French, or you would have *corrected* me when I have mistyped
'Reporters Sans Frontieres' in one of my recent replies. (I have written
'Reporter Sans Frontieres'--reporter without 's' for the plural--and, figure,
I know French!)
I make errors and type typos daily, I can live with that. The best professor I
ever have had, on analysis, and a very good personal friend of Polya [it has
always been highly interesting, and amusing, to listen some anecdotes on Polya
once a while during the lessons], always warned us to please correct him as
soon he wrote a *betise* [such, e.g., elementary arithmetic addition errors]
at the blackboard. Mainly for not wasting too much time in hunting an error
backwards, less for *proving* him that, say, 5 - 2 = 3 and not = 4.
Maybe verbiage is a reason why you are making it difficult to quote you.
9/11 has been planned much earlier than 2001. (If you can't understand, figure
out why, then I can't help you much anyway.) One--one out of many--signs
of it, is that the Internet--how it would have evolved--has FATALLY [read:
LUCKILY for us ... 'us' the world] been under-evaluated, wrongly weighted and
assessed in its development and potential by the 9/11 *architects*. 9/11 would
possibly NOT have been unmasked as the inside job, the synthetic terrorism
operation it has been, if there would not have been the Internet.
Do you see the implications [cherries-like: Madrid, 7/7, ..., Georgia right
now] of that?
Moreover, similarly to the insane clique who sporadically came out from the
bunkers of an encircled Berlin to still send the remaining boys from the
Hitler-youth to their death, the deranged clique in Washington thinks to have
a 2nd *chance*. (And a 3rd, after the 2nd.)
With the difference that NOW the Internet has been BETTER assessed, and the
expert [simulation] programs adapted accordingly.
If you have managed to follow me till here [bizarre that I am somewhat
thinking at *social engineering*!] then you can continue by yourself.
I hope you understand better Tor's context now.
PS: as someone else from the mailing list has told to you already, please

be my-favorite-topic-talk.  Sometimes they want to tell everybody
about the fiendish floridators, or about religious or ethnic groups
that they dislike, or about who really shot JFK, or how the world
economy is secretly run by a cabal of Israeli lemur-smugglers.  I
don't know whether they genuinely believe that they're on topic, or
whether they know they're off-topic but can't help themselves, or
whether they are just trying to find an audience that they cannot get
In practice, it makes no difference why they disrupt the list:
off-topic crap makes the list less useful, and needs to go.  It gives
people who follow the list big piles of non-tor-related stuff to wade
through, and lowers the tenor of discussions in general by getting
people pissed off pointlessly.  (Is it just me, or have a lot of
discussions here gotten way more _ad hominem_ in the last couple of
months?)  I know we made this list in order to have somewhere slightly
more broad-ranging than or-dev, but it's still supposed to be a
discussion list about Tor, not a flame list about everything.
Moderation here seems to be limited to writing a mail like this once
or twice a year, and booting really obnoxious people when we get
around to it.  This approach has the advantage of leaving stuff pretty
open, and letting people err on the side of speaking their minds.  But
it has the disadvantage of giving some people the impression that
anything that doesn't get them kicked off is okay.  That's regrettable
in my opinion.
Some requests:
   * Please, before your next post, ask yourself, "Is this really
     about Tor?"  Then ask, "Would anybody else agree that it's about
     Tor?"  Remember, other people joined this list in order to
     discuss Tor too... and the "Tor" that they joined up to discuss
     is not some unusual sense of the word "Tor" that includes grey
     aliens, or Lyndon LaRouche/Ayn Rand fanfic, or whatever.
   * Please don't get in the habit of responding to insane off-topic
     people.  When you do, there are now _two_ people discussing the
     Fiendish Fluoridators on rec.pets.cats.
   * If you're in the habit of flaming people, could you please
     ratchet it down some?  Whether your targets deserve it or not,
     not all matters of truth and right are best decided through
     bloodsport.
   * If you're wondering whether I might be talking about you, please
     act as though I am.  Even if I'm not, (and I say this with all
     respect) we could all stand to get more polite and more on-topic.
     Myself included!

Jake, Mike, Karsten, Sebastian, and I attended Hacking at Random last
week in The Netherlands. I did a talk on Tor performance challenges ?
basically walking through the key pieces of the "Why Tor is Slow"
document that we wrote in March.
As usual with European hacking cons, they produced a really well-done
video just days after my talk. So if you want to get the highlights on
what we're doing to speed up Tor and what roadblocks remain, take a look
at the video and also the slides that come with it.
I just put a torrent of this up at
It uses the hidden tracker and should work for Tor users and non-tor
users. It actually appears to be down right now but it'll come up
eventually. It has both the regular .onion and the tor2web url in it.

Right... so in the case of law enforcement, you are going to ask law
enforcement to fund a project that (this is not my opinion, this will
be theirs) allows people to access illegal content anonymously and
makes their job that much harder? That's low hanging fruit? Hate to

Your computer is too slow to handle this many circuit creation

option or choosing a more restricted exit policy.
I have been monitoring the system and while it is true that sometimes
it tops one processor, it occupies most of the time just 50 % of one
processor. I have also configured Tor daemon to use two threads so
even if it tops one it could still switch to another. But it rarely
passes 100 % (that is, it rarely really uses two processors). The
system as a whole has also not topped its CPU power. And while load
does not seem to be so high I get at the same time this errors. Is
there some other system bound which would be causing this and not CPU?
Are there some other performance tweaks I could try?
I am using Tor 0.2.0.31 (r16744) on FreeBSD amd64. Should I maybe
upgrade to devel version?

firewalls and anti-viruses. WideCap acts as virtual network driver
covering all your TCP/IP activity. No launchers - just run your program
as usual and work via proxy.
New proxy engine - fully rewritten proxy engine taken from the FreeCap

after changing the proxy chain or Widecap configuration. Plus boosted

with Craigslist, Google, Facebook, Ebay, LiveJournal and Identi.ca.
In most cases, they come to us to ask how they can handle the jerks
without punishing everyone.  This implies they see value in Tor.
Something more automated, like nymble, may be a boon to more acceptance
of Tor (
: I know craigslist and google are blocking posts/accounts

I believe these are automated systems blocking posts or such, and not
targeted at Tor itself.  AOL/ISP proxies run into the same
: And there's all sorts of partner groups such as EFF/ACLU/EPIC
We've talked to all three over the years.  The EFF is very much in touch
with us and we talk frequently.
: Are there such companies that openly allow tor
: such that their testimonials would be a useful
: compliment in such conversations? ie: livejournal
: noticing a loss of userbase when blocking tor.
Unfortunately, not so much.  Many organization who both handle Tor from
their userbase and use it interally don't want to become the posterchild
for Tor in corporations.  This is unfortunate for both us and them.  I
think the more enlightened a company is about handling privacy, the more
their userbase will trust them.  I'm more likely to use a company if
they say they respect my privacy by allowing me to use Tor; but I'm
probably biased.  If someone wants to help coordinate a lunch or some meetup; there are
Tor people that can show up to help.  I've been impressed by some of the
presentations others have done about Tor, online privacy, anonymity and
why this matters, all over the world.

were some OC features being drafted to assist with this, though I do not
know the current dev status on them. Till then, it's the honor system.<=
On the big plus side, OC provides IPv6 function. Most you can
do over native IPv6 can be do over OC over Tor (except maybe
routing which need yet another layer).
So you can do auth via ZRTP, ssh known-hosts, even IPSEC/IKE.
So some good classes of bluffing are mooted by this I believe, no.
If app has no built in and no IPSEC, then you are at risk for today.

Why does frequent connecting and disconnecting of the internet connection reduce =
the level of anonymity?
Someone observing your computer would know when you are connected to the internet =
or to the anonymization service. If this observer also observes the first mix =
in the anonymization service, he would see connections and disconnections there =
as well. He could then draw conclusions as to which user is visiting which =
Let us assume the following example:
    * It is known that a user is downloading a large file (for example, 50MB).
    * It is also known that another user is only surfing.
The observer also sees that one of them frequently connects and disconnects =
from the internet while the other is constantly connected. Then it's clear =
that the one who is constantly connected is downloading the file and the other =
one is the one surfing. Somit ist klar, wer von beiden die Datei herunterl=C3=A4dt =
und wer nur surft.
The problem remains even with many users. Statistical averages can be made =
of people who were logged in at the same time. Thus it becomes relatively easy =
to determine who did what at what time.

I do my development on WinXP but for hosting am using FreeBSD because Win sucks in that point especially when it comes to security.
Now all this works well when I perform it like a root, but when I want nobody(apache) to parse file.php that is calling Tor will not work.
I know why - nobody doesn't have a permission for that.
I installed Tor like a ROOT using  "portinstall -s security/tor"  command.
Now..., I would like to chmod tor to allow nobody to run it with certain PID but I simply can't find Tor even if I use. (Yes I know - this is very funny!)
If I can't find Tor dir on my server how am I suppose to chmod it?
To shorten... How do I allow nobody to utilize Tor (It can already do that but I must start it like a root and stop it like a root)
PS: Why after I start Tor like a root by typing "tor" in command line it start and then I simply can't issue ANY command to my server, whatever I type in command line and press enter it is like I am typing some text in a word(or nano for a unix)?

No idea what influence that has regarding TOR in general, as a

Is it possible to remotely test software ??  Or can this always be overcome with

     The problem of corrupted exit servers is indeed one that we should allponder until a solution may be found.  However, setting up, say, 1,000 hidden,slaved, correctly configured tor servers via a bot net may be rather moredifficult to accomplish than you have fully considered.  Entry guards andmiddlemen probably wouldn't be useful to an attack coordinator.-----------------------

It works.  It gets slow now and then but that is just fine.
I have another custom application (on a laptop) that suddenly stopped working.
After some digging around, it turns out that our ISP is blocking
certain UDP ports.
This application uses UDP to download its data.
This application will accept ip : port for a proxy.
So I put  192.168.6.9 : 8118 but there are no downloads happening.
At the same time from the Tor-enabled FireFox, I can verify
that Tor is working because I have set the home page to

On the other hand, the Tor developers have publicly made note of the
ability of Tor to circumvent the Chinese firewall, calling China "a
global active adversary with a lot of manpower and money, and severe
penalties to discourage people from trying."
Given the fact that access to these smaller projects has been blocked,
I think the "Tor is small enough to be flying below the radar"
argument has some strikes against it. I think there must be some other
reason(s) in addition to this one as to why Tor has not been blocked.

What I'm trying to figure out is what, specifically, is now enabled by default that was not before? I mean, the Tor FAQ talks about two things relating to traffic limiting: The BandwithRate/BandwidthBurst options, and the AccountingStart/AccountingMax options. Is it some setting related to these that is now set by default? Or is it something entirely different? If it is different, can we get a short explanation of the changes? Also, if it is different, is there a config file setting that would make a server behave the way it did before these changes were implemented?

yes to what the police wants, because they often do not know what they are doing, they have
few time and other common reasons. But i also know that the police in germany and most all other countries only uses the IP number
from the TCP/IP protocoll and that therefore using a proxy of your provider makes you 99,999 %
Therefore i'm using transparent proxies (Squid, ftp-proxy/frox, maybe soon some for https) plus a provider
proxy as parent proxy for the exit traffic of my TOR server.
The main problem is that for police and judges there is no quality controll, e. g. ISO 9001, but that's far away from TOR.

been part of Debian for years:

Uzbl follows the UNIX philosophy - "Write programs    that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to    work together. Write programs to handle text streams,    because that is a universal interface."
    * very minimal graphical interface. You only see       what you need
    * what is not browsing, is not in uzbl. Things       like url changing, loading/saving of bookmarks,       saving history, downloads, ... are handled through       external scripts that you write
    * controllable through various means such as fifo       and socket files, stdin, keyboard and more
    * advanced, customizable keyboard interface with       support for modes, modkeys, multichars, variables       (keywords) etc. (eg you can tweak the interface       to be vim-like, emacs-like or any-other-program-like)
    * focus on plaintext storage for your data and       configs in simple, parseable formats
    * Uzbl keeps it simple, and puts you in charge.
This project is still in its infancy, started in April.
But since it is built on webkit, the core is already
written.  It seems that there is a large group of very
interested developers working on this and making large
rapid strides.  I look forward to their progress and
hope that perhaps someone with an anonymity bend will
see what they can do with it and tor!

AFAIK, google does not allow torizens to sign up for even

sending a text to your cell phone to 'verify' you first. Or similarly
breaking your anonymity and annoyance factor by linking you to
two other email accounts via an 'invite'. So long as this proof

have to comply to the law or face charges.
Law says any change of connection data (replacing IP/Port) has to be
logged in conjunction with the old connection. So you would have a list
of IP/port (original) and IP/Port (new). Depending on the multiplexing
of the Tor connections that _could_ lead to a connection being
traceable. Furthermore it does not does not fully specify what
"connection data" is. I am pretty sure that they will claim that streams
have to be identified. In that case even the multiplexing wont help us
anymore. An additional problem could be when they define Tor as being
_one_ service and not something provided by many service_s_. In that
case there would be some end-to-end logging that they require.
The bureaucrats comments of the law proposal are pretty telling and it
seems like they want all the tools for total oppression.
One thing however that could help us is that the logging requirements
don't seem to affect every kind of traffic but only certain types
(Web,Mail,Voip). If they forget to put Tor in the list specifically it
could create a loophole for us.

As for your second point, we disagree.  As a volunteer service provider, I

own experience of running Tor exit nodes, this has been the case.
Spending a few hours with local law enforcement explaining Tor and why
my IP showed up in their case is worth the cost of providing online
anonymity to me.  We're working to reduce the "cost of Tor", which is these few hours, by
talking to law enforcement around the world as much as possible.  Many
of these people realize the value of Tor in their own roles.  As Roger

MaxConnections can be raised to a max. value of 512 (100 is the default
value and 256 is not high enough). TcpTimedWaitDelay determines the time that must elapse before TCP can
release a closed connection and reuse its resources. This period between
closure and release is the TIME_WAIT state. The default value is 240

closed connections a lot quicker.

    case CPATH_STATE_AWAITING_KEYS:

It seems assert_cpath_layer_ok() got called just a hand
full of times in the source. Looking over them showed
the using of it in circuitlist.c at line 429 in the
function assert_cpath_ok(const crypt_path_t *cp).
The inline-comment /* layers must be in sequence of:
\"open* awaiting? closed*\" */ says it. cp->state could
be CPATH_STATE_AWAITING_KEYS (at least following lines
check for that), but assert_cpath_layer_ok() doesn\'t
allow that.

is somewhat deeper in the tor-code then me and is able

... as it appears that only that release and newer can be assured of proper "HardwareAccel" support ...
- New AccelName and AccelDir options add support for dynamic OpenSSL hardware crypto acceleration engines.
While there are several drivers in FreeBSD, my own impression is that the ubsec driver is the right choice, currently, as it drives a long list of broadcom-based PCI cards, most notably the BCM5821, which is the chip driving the "Sun Crypto 1000" which can be had cheaply on ebay, and the BCM5825, which is the latest and greatest of these cards.
One caveat with the BCM5821 or the Sun Crypto 1000 is that not all of them support AES - I can't tell for sure, but it looks like AES support was added after the fact, and it depends on firmware version.  The BCM5825 is a safer bet if you're buying off of ebay, etc., but is more expensive.
Everything I have mentioned here appears to be pci64/pci-X, rather than I got these loose numbers off of an archived list discussion, but it appears to be false.  Again from irc:
"tor is actually cpu-bound rather than ram-bound on the fast relays i think you should be able to push 10MB/s in 1G of ram"
So crypto-acceleration appears to be useful.
Unanswered questions:
- how painful is actual integration?  Just because the driver is there and those options are available in Tor doesn't mean it will be a snap.  Word on the street is that "coderman" has actually done this ... comments ?
- Is the BCM5825 the most powerful solution that can be easily made to work on FreeBSD ?  The soekris cards are much less powerful, the SafeNet 1741 has a lower throughput and the 1742/1746 parts are not listed on the FreeBSD HCL.  Not sure where the Sun Crypto 6000 lies on this continuum, but it appears to NOT be a broadcom based card.
- Is anyone _actually_ testing Tor, and more specifically, hardware crypto acceleration of Tor, in high speed (gigabit) test environments ?
- Is anyone _actually_ performing SSL operations in CUDA using GPUs, and if not, how much of my free time and mindshare over the next year will be spent on that fascinating question ?
I'll be ordering some parts and setting up some rudimentary tests in the next few months, but any comments or suggestions or war stories would be very helpful.

[Q:] If you had the power to change up to three things in the world
today that are related to IT security, what would they be?
[A:] Internet design--that's enough.
[Q:] That's it? What's wrong with the design of the Internet?
[A:] There's anonymity. Everyone should and must have an
identification, or Internet passport. The Internet was designed not
for public use, but for American scientists and the U.S. military.
That was just a limited group of people--hundreds, or maybe thousands.
Then it was introduced to the public and it was wrong=85to introduce it
in the same way.
I'd like to change the design of the Internet by introducing
regulation--Internet passports, Internet police and international
agreement--about following Internet standards. And if some countries
don't agree with or don't pay attention to the agreement, just cut
them off.
This is scary talk from a man who owns the largest anti-virus company
in the eastern hemisphere.  Read these articles, and you'll see this
guy talks about a global "Internet police" or "Internet Interpol".
That's serious globalization talk from someone who millions trust to
protect their computers.  All they need to do is label some code as
malicious, and it'll be removed from your PC after the next A/V
update....even if you use it to regain lost civil liberties.  How long
until Kaspersky labels Tor a trojan or virus?  If that happens, then
People who seek to control society fear society having anonymity, for
it's with anonymity that society can stand up against corruption of
the state when it occurs.  The latest Iran election and the actions
that followed are a great example of this, and it's was technology
such as Tor that helped them get the truth out about what was being
done.  When was the last time a trojan horse or virus helped a country
regain liberty or help bypass censorship?  To treat Tor as such
malware is down right insulting to people's rights everywhere.
Normally I would never think about the following, but as a developer,
I'm weighing the idea of detecting, disabling, and/or deleting
Kaspersky before installing any of the projects I work on.  Such
action should be brought to the users attention, and the action to do
something about it should be evoked by the user.  However, if
Kaspersky does go too far and labels Tor as malware, you can be damn
sure JanusVM, *maybe* Tor VM, and Chromium Browser VM will take
automated action to prevent itself from being attacked by Kaspersky
products, and will do so in a very harsh way.
Something worth noting, today's A/V solutions do not scan inside
virtual machines and would not be able to detect Tor easily.  Use
encryption with the VM and it'll be impossible for any A/V product to
scan the data inside.  If you use an external anonymity device like
januspa or a linux router + Tor, then you would not feel the affects
of bad A/V software against your anonymity.
Personally, I will be encouraging everyone I know to stay as far away
from this company and their products simply out of principle
point.  I had no problem with Kaspersky until I read this.  If
Kaspersky is going to treat non malicious software as malware, then we
might as well treat their software with the same regard.
Spread the word, Kaspersky Labs is not a friend of Tor.

meaning.  It means we cannot identify a person.  Note that the failure
to identify a person makes no reference to kind of identification.
There need be no preference for "real life" names versus pseudonyms
versus IP addresses versus whatever else you can think of.  Anything
that identifies a person contradicts the concept that this person is
This has practical implications.  For instance, as someone pointed
out, when the Chinese police raid a dissident's apartment, and search
his hard drive, they are able to tie the pseudonym to a "real life"
identity.  If the police can also connect the pseudonym to what they
consider "crime," the distinction between a pseudonym and a "real
life" name loses much of its value; hopefully, the pseudonym permitted
the dissident to continue his activities for longer.
Now, I will certainly agree, as someone else pointed out, that Tor
should permit the use of pseudonyms or other forms of authentication.
But the fact remains that any identification--as implied by
authentication--contradicts anonymity; it is therefore something which
Tor should not involve itself with.
Simply put, it is not and cannot be Tor's problem.

also be meaninful, and that you personally would prefer to set your
policy the other way, i.e. that you'd only allow traffic into your own
country - but this still leads to the same technical problems.
Although, combining client and server algorithms might lead to some working approach (if the problem with the license could be solved):
 - the server announces his exit policy, including countries
 - the client has her own DB of countries
 - they act independently on their databases and some exiting streams
   get rejected - how bad could that be? possibly just a small    percentage of connections that get rejected. Does anyone know how static the distribution of IPs <-> countries is?
Haven't read the 'academical contribution page' from tor for a while,
but how about adding this point to that list?

So how can you trust this ? ;-)
Did we have to replace Tor with pigeons to carry our mail ?  ;-)
But can I really trust these pigeons ? AArrggg!!! I'll kill these pigeon right now:
they never talk !!!!!

of a customer causing a massive loss. I don't know what they pay for
traffic, but Hetzner rack colo asks for 0.10 EUR/GByte, and I assume
(on no evidence whatsoever) that they're not making a lot on traffic.
Assuming a 10 MByte/s throughput, you'll burn some 27 TBytes/month,
which would run down to about 2.7 kEUR/month burn rate. Even if
it's a fraction of that, that's a lot of money to lose on a single
customer, if the margins are paper-thin (and they probably are). So if they're not suggesting strongly that you do not prolong your contract (or throttle you into the ground, as happened with
my last East-German provider who sold a so-called flat rate
server, which strangely, conveniently went offline after I had
my little interview with the local cops -- who, I should hasten
to add, were very nice and professional about the entire thing), they're either extremely honorable about their contracts, or maybe somebody has asked them (nicely, or otherwise) to keep that thing running. For whatever reasons.
Just sayin'.

P(M|C) = P(C|M)*P(M)/P(C)
Summing out M to obtain P(C):
P(C) = P(M)*P(C|M) + P(~M)*P(C|~M)
P(M|C) = P(C|M)*P(M)/(P(M)*P(C|M) + P(~M)*P(C|~M))
Example 1: Fully Correlating Global Adversary
This example deals with an adversary trying to correlate EVERYTHING on
a 5000 concurrent stream network at all times. 5000 concurrent streams
means 5000 entry connections and 5000 exit connections (as an
approximation). This gives 5000^2 possible entry-exit pairings
network-wide, thus:
P(M) = (1/5000)^2 = 4E-8
99.9% EER generic correlation detector:
P(C|M) = 0.999
P(C|~M) = 0.001
P(M|C) = 0.999*4E-8/(4E-8*0.999 + (1-4E-8)*0.001)
P(M|C) = .00004 or .004%.
In other words, we expect that for every 25000 times the correlator
predicts a matching pair, only one of those actually is a valid
match. So much for dragnet surveillance.
Example 2: Single Site-targeting Global Adversary
In this example, the adversary is only interested in connections to a
particular site, say wikileaks.org. For this, let's say the adversary
only has one exit stream at a given time to correlate to a given entry
stream, giving:
P(M) = 1/5000 = .0002
P(M|C) = 0.999*.0002/(.0002*0.999 + (1-.0002)*0.001)
P(M|C) = .1666 = 16.66%
So this means that we expect the adversary to have 6 suspect users for
every user that leaks a document to wikileaks.org for a 99.9% accurate
correlator. Unlike the dragnet adversary, the targeted adversary is still
pretty effective, especially since they will almost certainly have additional
a-priori information about the users they suspect to have done the leak.
However, if their correlator drops to just 99% EER, however, P(M|C) drops
to 0.0194 or 1.94%. At 90% EER, P(M|C) is 0.0018 or 0.18%. These
provide with expectations of confusion sets of 52 and 556 users respectively.
Example 3: Single Site-targeting "Local" Adversary
To extend this into the capabilities of a local adversary (as opposed
to global), insert a (c/n)^2 factor into P(M) to account for the likelihood
that the adversary will see both sides of a connection, where c is the
percentage of network bandwidth they control, and n is the total network
capacity. Common accepted reasonable values for c/n are on the order
of 0.1, though this may be much higher for IX-level yet not quite fully
global adversaries[3]. Let's go with 0.3.
P(M) = (1/5000)*(0.3)^2 = .000018
P(M|C) = 0.999*.000018/(.000018*0.999 + (1-.000018)*.001)
P(M|C) = 0.0177 = 1.77%
So this means that an adversary with control of 30% of the network
(such as China, the US, or Germany) can expect to go through 57 other
users before coming across a legitimate match predicted by their
timing detector. At 99% EER, this number goes up to 562, and at 90%
EER, all the way up to 6173.
This seems a bit more infeasible, but may still be doable with enough
information or many repeated observations.
So what does this all mean? Well, first of all, it underscores the
importance of being absolutely clear in timing attack research about
exactly what success probabilities are being reported, so we can
better compare both attacks and defenses. In fact, in the opinion of
this humble Raccoon, a large body of work is somewhat suspect for
lack of clarity, both in this and other respects.
Second, it gives us a small glimmer of hope that maybe all is not lost
against IX, National, or ISP level adversaries. Especially those with
only sampled or connection-level resolution, where fine-grained
details on inter-packet timings is not available (as will likely be
the case with EU data retention).
Finally, it also quantifies that we certainly do benefit from a larger
anonymity network not just in terms of nodes, but also in terms of
total concurrent users doing similar things (like short-lived web
traffic). This quantification strongly indicates that we should avoid
splitting the network into segments if we want to gain any additional
utility from growing it further, aside from simply supporting more
users at some fixed level of anonymity.
