@_subject: Tor t-shirt 
I requested a free Tor t-shirt for running an exit node,
according to:
However, the EFF inadvertantly sent me two shirts!  Anyone
running an exit node want the extra shirt?  It's a large.
Let me know...

Yeah, I suspected that was the case; however, I did manage to get
a couple of them ~2 months ago.  I just felt keeping both shirts
would be a bit greedy... ;-)
BTW, my extra shirt *has* found a new home.
It sounds like a good idea to me.  The shirt, in my experience,
has been a good vehicle for getting the message about the project
out there!  I've had several really good conversations about tor
while wearing the shirt, and even ended up convincing someone
they ought to be running a node... :)

@_subject: memory usage slowly rising 
Relevant information:
- linux 2.4.x under user mode linux
- guest has 64M of RAM allocated
- guest has 64M of swap allocated
- running tor vers 0.1.1.14 (official debian package on sarge)
I end up having to reboot my node about once every 3-4 days
because eventually all the VM in the guest gets allocated and the
kernel gets very angry.
I use:
BandwidthRate 200 KB
BandwidthBurst 250 KB
Also, I use the default exit policy.
I've been recording system memory usage over the past few days
and it just keeps steadily rising:
At Wed Feb 22 16:15:30 EST 2006:
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:  61734912 58466304  3268608        0  1880064 16465920
Swap: 67100672   290816 66809856
At Fri Feb 24 17:34:48 EST 2006:
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:  61734912 59625472  2109440        0   671744 29253632
Swap: 67100672 27660288 39440384
Notice the huge rise is swap used.
Currently, the tor process is consuming 70024 kB of virtual
address space, and has a 41296 kB RSS.
Unfortunately, I haven't been watching the tor process usage
until just now, but I will next time the uml guest is restarted.
Tor is effectively the only daemon running inside the
guest--privoxy and sshd are there, but are consuming only a
couple MB.
Anyone else running a tor node in UML?  The latest alphas have
been much better than the stable line in terms of CPU usage, but
they all seem to exhibit the same memory usage patterns.
I wonder if this is an artifact of running inside UML?

@_subject: Running a Tor exit node on an academic network? 
Well, I'm not, but if you look at the network status page, you'll
see that there are quite a few nodes running on academic
networks.  In fact, many of the top throughput nodes are in
 lists 24 .edu
domains, of which there are 9 live exit nodes:
bolanda      pingwin.icm.edu.pl
cherubim     sledgehammer.mit.edu
err          err.cylab.cmu.edu
gnunet       tripwire.cs.ucla.edu
golem        golem.ph.utexas.edu
riceu        sysrack07.cs.rice.edu
rodos        rodos.eecs.harvard.edu
serifos      serifos.eecs.harvard.edu
sipbtor1     alice-whacker.mit.edu
If you look at the by-bandwidth listings, there are many academic
nodes near the top of the list:
Perhaps you could use some of the contact information for one of
those nodes to find assistance?

Thanks, that was exactly what I was looking for.
Excellent, even more information. :)

If you're using Firefox you should take a look at the SwitchProxy
extension.  Setup details for tor use are here:
Also, you could specify your weather site as a proxy exception.
If you want to do this with safari, enter e.g. weather.com into
the "Bypass proxy settings for these Hosts & Domains" text box:

@_subject: dynamically changable options in torrc? 
Is there a list of what options may be changed without restarting
the tor process? (i.e., change and kill -HUP )
By experimentation, I've discoverd that the various bandwidth
limiting options are changable.  How about hidden services?

Okay, good to know.
I'm quite familiar with valgrind, so when I get the chance I'll
try it out.  Too busy right now though. :(

@_subject: Do not use exitnode xyz 
Hm, interesting idea.  Intuitively, this makes sence, since you
probably can trust your own node a bit more than other nodes on
the tornet.
Are there any downsides to doing this?  I can't think of any, but
I'm not well-versed in the tor routing details.

@_subject: memory usage slowly rising 
I just ended up restarting my tor process, but here is a graph of
the memory usage of the process over the past ~4 days:
Looks pretty leaky to me, especially with the Data/total numbers
diverging from the RSS.  Here's the new process:
These numbers are according to /proc//status.
The small dips in the graph happened sometimes when I reloaded
the tor config, and sometimes seemingly at random.
PS:  I had to restrict my node's outgoing ports because my ISP
was getting complaints about "bot net" traffic coming from my tor
node.  In case this becomes a more serious problem in the future,
does anyone have any suggestions for a co-location host that is a
bit more tor-friendly?  I'm currently with servermatrix (the
planet), and while they're quite good, they don't seem to be too
understanding when it comes to tor.

Thanks for the suggestion, they look pretty affordable.  I assume
you're running an exit node?  Do you use the default exit policy?

@_subject: Fun NJ law proposed... 
In particular, this part is scary:
"In addition, the bill makes any operator or Internet service
 provider liable for compensatory and punitive damages as well as
 costs of a law suit filed by a person damaged by the posting of
 such messages if the operator or Internet service provider fails
 to establish, maintain and enforce the policy required by section
 2 of the bill."
Well, the rest of it's scary, too... ;-)

@_subject: memory usage slowly rising 
I agree with you, but when I say "tor friendly", I mean "willing
to listen to me when I try to explain what the situation is".  I
had a lot of trouble trying to convince them that my host was not
part of a bot network, and also had trouble trying to find out
what the destination port specified in the abuse report was.
Granted, they never turned off my service through the whole
thing, but it just seemed inflexible.  I guess that's what I get
for going with a "bulk" hosting provider--it's got its ups and
downs... ;-)
I ended up switching from the default exit policy to a more
restrictive policy.  It's not a huge deal, I guess I would just
have appreciated more communication back and forth.
