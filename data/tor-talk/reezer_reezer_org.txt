Which actually is a bit sad, cause RSA appears to be replaceable Latice-based cryptography:
As the article says though one needs to choose one of two drawbacks here, performance or proven(!) security. They are intersting, cause they are not NP-Hard and still can't be attacked by today's knowledge. There is at least one alternative that is hard for quantum computers and in fact is NP-Hard, which is the McEliece cryptosystem. However it has properties that appear to basically render it insecure.
One  hast to also keep in mind that the symmetric algorithm to be fast enough. I don't know - or better said, I didn't find - anything about this topic yet. In general one shouldn't forget that the attacker can always "simply" use the weaker cipher and currently it really seems to be AES, because it's harder to know about its propertierties, being not simply based on prime numbers. Also there are a number of attacks on it now, some of them that maybe someone could find out about how they can be used correctly.
But still, the chances of finding an attack against an application that reveals the plaintext in some way is something that's a way more likely threat and attacks against applications are something that constantly happens. Bad behavior, timing attacks, etc. are a way more realistic attack vector. And hey, they can try to figure out who sends traffic that is encrypted and appears in certain intervals, etc. making them look suspicious and visit them. That's where Tor outperforms stuff like VPN that is easier to analyze it seems, cause all the do is encrypting I hope someone finds some flaws in this and tells me, cause I wanna know whether I am right about all this.

@_subject: [tor-talk] VPS Suggestions for Middle Relay 
I am currently switching to dedicated servers, but if you don't want to allow exits then there is a German provider, Keyweb that offers very cheap virtual servers (if you take them for longer you even cheaper than listed). The nice thing about them is that they are really nice, raising the limits (open file descriptors, etc) for the VPS. Currently I am using the cheapest and between 200 and 300 connections, relay only.
For virtual servers it makes sense to lower the advertised bandwidth, so you lower the connection count, save some file descriptors and RAM.
As I said, it is relay only, cause I am using the server for other things too (having two IP addresses, but still). However when I contacted them some time ago they said they'd forward abuse, giving a chance to react, so you might be able to run an exit relay.
Have been running the relay for a couple of years, together with some typical "home server" stuff. They are extremely cheap when it comes to VPS and what I really enjoyed is how they tracked down a problem I experienced. They managed to find out that the motherboard's timer broke and was the cause of some strange behavior in the virtual machines. They changed it and everything worked again.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Should I warn against Tor? 
You may be overlooking the fact that even when you are visiting European websites you may very well be sending requests to the US. In fact this is something very likely to happen.
Also wouldn't the behavior of connecting through the US be actually beneficial in such context?
Lets pretend you want to make a connection to a US server. Your connection starts at the client side, so your computer, where it will be encrypted before it goes through Tor relays. Now given your Tor exit relay is in the US and your (probably unencrypted) traffic really leaves the network there Tor just provided you with an anonymizing, encrypting tunnel through those tapped IXs.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor Flashproxy Badge as Firefox Extension 
I really like Cupcake for Chrome and recommended it to many friends. However, I didn't have a simple way to do this on Firefox, so I thought I'd create something like that.
Since I never ever created an extension before and it's really just a few lines of code that should turn on the cookie and adds the badge it doesn't look really good.
Currently it's basically what the iframe does (+adding the flashproxy browser cookie, so it still works, should it become opt-in only). I hope it is helpful to people using Firefox and want a quick way to become a relay. Sorry it doesn't look really good yet.
I might put the code on GitHub or so later.

Thank you, I will fix that.
The code should be viewable. I think you can open it like a zip.
Well, I did it using the Addon-SDK, which is recommended for various reasons. I will see how it develops in future.
I am not sure, whether it works anymore. Somehow the button turns black, which could be a general problem with Flashproxy though. No Firefox support? Maybe use another library? I wonder whether socket.io or sockjs could be used, since they allow fallbacks. Would be really interesting.
Oh? I thought cookies were domainwide. I will have a look on it.
I noticed this too. Cool, now I know how to fix it.
Maybe related to the SDK. I will have a look on it, once I have more time.
Thanks so much for testing and providing feedback! :)

That's intersting. Did you really try it on Firefox? I can only get the bundle working on Chrome. I tried running it in debug mode and receive an "Operation is insecure" message.

If you really just want to use another IP address you could use your normal browser and connect through a usual one hop proxy for example. It may even give you a faster browsing experience. Tor is a really great project, but it sounds like you have a different use case.

@_subject: [tor-talk] New version of the Tor Flashproxy Badge Firefox Extension 
I just wanted to give a quick heads up on my Firefox extension. It's now not really a badge anymore (maybe someone knows a better name?). I replaced the icon and aso I included the Flashproxy JS into the application and gave it a lot of lifting (300 lines instead of 1000), removing mostly the badge and some not really used features.
I did this not for the sake of forking, but because I wanted to replace the badge stuff with an event based interface, so I can make it more like an extension. Also users told me they wanted to see numbers of how many people they helped and things like that. One could also add a configuration interface. Another thing is that I think just using the badge forces me to have the extension bound to the UI. I really hope this doesn't come off like an evil fork, because I mainly wanted to have a small working JavaScript class for Firefox.
Also this has the benefit of executing trusted JavaScript (not just downloading and executing it when the extension loads), which may be considered a security benefit. The HTTPS version never worked for me on Firefox. I think on Chrome it works just fine.
What would be really cool would be some kind of logo and a better icon. Currently I just use a small roundish thingy (people didn't like the look of the badge). So if anyone has fun with designing that would be really cool as I am awful at this.
The last thing that was requested was putting the source code on GitHub and now it is:
The add-on itself can be found here:
Hope you enjoy. Feedback is welcome!

Hello. I am the maintainer of the pkgsrc packages. I am going to update them as soon as I can. I barely have any time recently, so please forgive me the delay.

An update on this. It's now on pkgrsc-wip:
This not just means NetBSD and DragonFly (although they switch to another system right now), but also illumos, Minix and other systems potentially using pkgsrc:
