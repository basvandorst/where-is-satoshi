@_subject: [tor-talk] Optimizing Tor Browser Bundle for use with Hidden 
Tor was built for anonymous use for the World Wide Web and Clearnet websites.
However, I am wondering if there is a way we can optimize (or build from scratch) Tor for use with Hidden Service Websites to make browsing Hidden Services to faster and more efficient.
The Hidden Service Websites are the backbone of the Tor Browser Bundle and think we should start talking about optimizing the Tor software for use with Hidden Service websites, so it functions just as well as Clearnet websites.

We need to Optimize the Tor software to be able to Streamline access to Tor Hidden Services to make it more?smooth-running and efficient.
