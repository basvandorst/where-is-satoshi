?????? ????,
I am not a Tor developer but I will try to answer (in English, as my
Russian is appalling).
The applications within TBB have been audited for DNS leaks. If you only
use those apps then you should not have that problem to worry about. A
greater issue is that of your usage pattern, i.e. if you give away your
identity by another means (e.g. by posting on a mailing list, or logging
into Facebook) there is nothing Tor (or Privoxy) can do about it.
If you wish to use other applications with Tor then you may need to take
precautions to avoid DNS and other leaks. This is easier said than done,
and if you lack the necessary computer science knowledge then I would
advise considering whether it's a risk you need to take. Merely
installing something like Privoxy will do nothing except give you a
false sense of security.
If you dig through the torproject.org website you will find information
concerning this topic; approaches include creating a separate user
account which transparently torifies all network activity, or performing
all anonymous work within a dedicated virtual machine.
If you can achieve everything you need through the Tor Browser itself
then your privacy is primarily dependent on your own discipline. IMHO
this would be the best path for a newbie to take.

As the GPL is one of the license options, there is no way that any
contract or agreement between Google and Mozilla could possibly be
binding on a third party. Mozilla do impose restrictions on use of their

@_subject: [tor-talk] What is tor used for? 
I'm willing to speak up, although I'm not going to be very specific. As
Roger has already implied, it kind of defeats the point of Tor if you
then broadcast to the world what traffic you're pushing through it.
I am a part time political activist in the United Kingdom. Due to
disability and chronic illness I don't manage to do much work "on the
ground". Instead I work online to motivate and inform other activists,
and increase awareness of issues that our mostly state-supporting media
chooses not to report.
Things are not good here at the moment. Although we are by no means
China or Syria (thank G-d), we are not a free country either. There is
much to be challenged and the establishment has a strong interest in
further restrictions of liberty. Many people, myself included, have been
spuriously arrested over the past few years and police brutality has
become an everyday occurrence. The ethnic cleansing which we thought was
consigned to history is back, and many of us now live in genuine fear. I
assume the rest of the world is seeing very little of this.
I don't hide the fact that I'm against the government. It's pretty hard
to do what I do without being noticed. But that doesn't mean I want
everything to be public. That would be pretty dangerous. Like in the
USA, people are being badly beaten by the police simply for engaging in
legitimate protest. I am more likely than most to die from a beating
because I don't heal properly. If I don't have to publicise what I'm
doing and where I'm doing it, I don't intend to. I'm not engaging in
criminal activity, but I am fighting for my kids' rights and would like
to stay alive.
The UK is one of the most watched countries in the world. Tor allows
people like me to be selective in what we allow the authorities to know.
When the guys with the big sticks and guns are looking for any excuse to
have some fun, and the government is happy to increase their power, we
all have something to hide.

Google's tracking is of limited concern if you don't log in, and don't
keep a long running browser session open. It takes less time to
establish a Tor circuit over broadband than it used to take to connect
by modem. Shut down TBB when not in use and you should be fine. I'm not
saying there's no risk at all, but there's no reason why somebody who
understands the risks shouldn't be able to use Google carefully.
Personally I use DDG, partly because of privacy concerns and partly
because I don't like the new-look Google. You can always do a Google
search through DDG or Scroogle if you're feeling paranoid.
On topic, I'd prefer DDG or Ixquick as the default search in TBB but we
can't all have our preferences included.

@_subject: [tor-talk] New Browser Bundle 
The risks of traditional Netscape cookies are reasonably well
understood, and can be controlled. However because JS can tamper with
cookies the situation is more complicated than it seems.
The intuitive problem with JS is that it feels like the part of the core
browser architecture most likely to be vulnerable to a zero day attack.
I use fluffy language here deliberately. There's quite a jump from that
intuition to a falsifiable hypothesis, but it offers an explanation for
cautious behaviour.
NoScript offers other protections though which are more solid. Having
Flash and Java turned off by default would seem to be a Good Thing?. And
it intercepts various XSS/XSRF and clickjacking techniques (i.e. the
known problems with JS). I think it's safe to say that these are an
anonymity issue, and it adds some weight to the intuitive feeling that
allowing untrusted JS is not a good idea.
An advantage of having JS blocked is that you'll be alerted if a page
suddenly has a script you didn't expect. It could have been injected
there somehow by an adversary. If you have scripts enabled globally
you're not going to notice.
Personally I think the above is reason enough to have an opt-in policy
for scripting. Yes, it's a slight hassle on sites that depend heavily on
JS, but it offers some reassurance that I won't be inadvertently handing
over my details to a third party.

There's no general solution as this is a bootstrapping problem. However
anyone experienced enough to be responsible for signing releases of a
project such as Tor will undoubtedly have left traces elsewhere on the
net (unless they're working anonymously). For instance, they may be a
Debian developer, or have a Twitter account. By comparing fingerprints
or contact details published on different websites you can confirm that
they belong to the same person and therefore haven't been tampered with.
Deciding whether that person *should* be signing packages is a separate
problem, but which can be approached in a similar manner. Once you've
verified a key to your satisfaction, then add it to your keyring and
lsign it (that's "lsign", not "sign"). If ever a future download fails
verification because you don't trust the key, and you haven't been
notified of a change in signing key, then you know something is amiss.

You become good at implementing security by understanding how to break
it. Sometimes the world won't take a threat seriously without a live
demonstration. Sslstrip has been made available publicly as proof that
the attack is real and actually quite simple. It should also be clear
that it's not specific to Tor; any proxy could do it, including the
"transparent" proxies than many ISPs force traffic through.
The solution is simply "pay attention". If privacy is important to you
(because e.g. you're sending credit card data) then don't rely on
technology to alone protect you. Check that you're actually connected to
the site you expect. Consider not using Tor for the transaction (if you
don't actually need anonymity). Don't proceed if you're unsure. You
wouldn't give card details over the phone unless you were damn sure you

If you're running Tor as shipped (i.e. you've not modified the config)
then you can tell applications to use a SOCKS proxy on localhost port
9050. If you're running polipo then you might also have use of an HTTP
proxy on port 8123.
Tor itself isn't going to give you a secure connection though. It
assists (a lot) with anonymity, but otherwise is only as secure as the
protocol you use. If you use a plain text protocol (e.g. telnet) then
your traffic can still be snooped. You need to use encryption *as well
as* Tor if you want security.

will have to provide one; polipo is a good choice and is most likely in
your distribution's repository.
An alternative method is to use torsocks, which again should be in your
repository. Install it and read its manpage for more information.
Note that you won't get good performance using apt over Tor. Ask
yourself if you really need to. Also note that applications (even
command line ones) can leak your identity in very subtle ways. Tor is
only a tool, not a magic wand.
You will find more information on the Tor website.

off the shelf that fits the bill for the reasons given below.
This is harder than it sounds because...
For this guarantee to be plausible, all crypto operations need to be
performed client-side and in a manner that cannot be readily
compromised by the server. GPG encrypting stuff on the server isn't
going to cut it. Hushmail is known to have complied with court orders
to release plaintext emails; this wouldn't have been possible if there
wasn't a backdoor inherent in the design. You need to get your head
around why that is before even considering implementing anything, if
you want people to trust your service.

There is a relatively simple strategy for mitigating correlation

decoy traffic you need to effectively cover the trail. And to avoid the
decoys being readily identified, a proportion of them must propagate
through the network by at least two hops. This is plausible for high
latency networks such as remailers but completely impractical for Tor,
unless available bandwidth ever significantly exceeds demand.

Safety in numbers is never truer than with anonymity; compare with the
Black Bloc tactic often used at demonstrations. If everyone looks the

As soon as you use your own browser (stock Firefox, LWP::UserAgent,
whatever) you reduce your anonymity group substantially. If you're
unlucky you may have a unique browser fingerprint. And surprisingly you

Tor should deal with the technical side, as the network latency makes
everything happen at dial-up speed (or at least it does for me) and exit
routers won't know anything about your ISP connection.
However, linguistic fingerprinting is a much more plausible threat,
especially for those whose writing style is particularly distinctive.
For instance, I typically use few abbreviations, few contractions, long
sentences and lots of commas, which makes me stick out a mile on
services like Twitter. It takes a lot of effort to fake errors when
you're naturally anal.

One of the things that frequently spooks me off-Tor is ads that clearly
know what I've been doing elsewhere. i.e. I see an ad on one site
offering to sell me specific items I've been looking at on another.
Now, obviously as an experienced comp sci I'm aware of the technologies
that are being employed to do this, and I'm aware of the ways that the
Tor Browser, driven responsibly, offers protection against this.
But two things spring to mind. (1) Such ads already constitute a form
of social engineering. How long until an ad network comes up with an
ingenious psychological trick to convince a small but significant
percentage of normally responsible Tor users to deanonymise themselves?
(2) Given what they can already do using technologies we know about, I
can't help wondering if the advertising industry is in fact the true
Global Adversary. It wouldn't surprise me if they were putting more
resources into beating Tor than any nation state.

While I don't have a problem with your logic, my experience is that
capitalism is anything but logical. We're talking about an ideology
that derives value from chasing resources that they presume are
infinite when in fact they are not. Think about the banks foreclosing
on ordinary folk who happen to fall on hard times, rather than think
about the effect that will have on their future business. The concept
of low-hanging fruit fits with that to start with, but once they've
harvested all that fruit they're going to want more and more because
that's how their system works. I want you to be right but I'm not
As for intelligence agencies, well they're the people who would dangle

That freedom needs to be backed by education: people are only truly

It's not specific to AdBlock. If everybody used exactly the same fixed
list it wouldn't be an issue. But not there are a zillion ad networks
out there and incredible as it is some people actually click the damn
things. After all, if they didn't the industry wouldn't exist. Here's a
possible attack I can conceive:
Let's say Alice uses the default list, but chooses to unblock ads from
$ADSERVER because they frequently serve ads that relate to some niche
interest she has. $WEBSITE contains information which it is illegal to
possess in Alice's Orwellian island homeland. It is also one of those
annoying sites that embeds ads all over the place from multiple
networks and makes it impossible for neurodiverse types like her to
focus; exactly the sort of thing she wants the ad blocker to intercept.
Mallory controls one or more exits, and at some point has the ability to
see and tamper with Alice's unencrypted requests both to $WEBSITE and to
at least some of the servers on the block list. Alice's traffic stands
out because requests to $WEBSITE correlate with requests to $ADSERVER,
but not to the rest of the list (because she's not turned the blocker
off altogether). Her other connections can now be isolated from the
others by injecting some extra  tags into all returned pages and
looking for the same correlation (they don't have to be real resources;
Mallory can just send back a pile of 1x1 gifs that nobody will notice).
What happens next to Alice depends on many factors, but she certainly
isn't safe.
Remember that in this situation your anonymity set is restricted to
people currently using Mallory's exit(s), not the entire population of
Tor users. So to my mind, such fingerprinting passes the plausibility
test. I'm quite out of practice at this stuff, and Mike may have had a
different attack in mind.

Yes. Despite my qualms (I despise the ideology behind immersion
advertising and don't trust the perpetrators one iota) I think that
users are probably safer applying their own ad blocking if they wish
to, rather than have TBB impose it by default. It feels (NB this is
intuition, not research) like not having a consistent background
ruleset to compare against should amplify the amount of analysis needed
for effective fingerprinting. The biggest potential risk is if you use
the same plugin with the same settings for both anon and non-anon
traffic. I can't see a solution to that except education.

Ask someone else to do the same. Enjoy the 5 years of your life it

between your application and Tor to see if you can spot your IP in any
unencrypted traffic. Consume a lot of coffee.
Alternatively, stick to using software that's already been audited by

You asked a technical question and got several technical answers. But if
you are asking to be patronised, here goes: Nobody on this list can
give you any guarantees about software they have neither written nor
audited. Nor can they give you any guarantees about a computer system
they don't administer, including yours. This isn't a pedantic
technicality, it's just fact. Having got that out of the way, here are
some things to consider:
Tor Browser doesn't write anything sensitive to permanent storage. What
your OS does is not under the control of the Tor Browser.
Tor Browser doesn't include Flash, so Flash concerns are irrelevant.
What standard Firefox (or any other browser) does is not under the
control of the Tor Browser.
What your OS chooses to write to its swap file(s) is not under the
control of the Tor Browser.
If you don't want your OS to use swap, then turn off swap. Most modern
systems have enough RAM to run perfectly well without it. How to
achieve this depends on what OS you're running. This is not under the
control of the Tor Browser. On some systems it is possible to use
encrypted swap, which is generally a good idea. It does reduce
performance under load, but if you're swapping heavily already that's
probably not your first concern.
If you don't want to write hibernation data, don't hibernate. This is
not under the control of the Tor Browser.
If you don't trust your proprietary OS (e.g. Windows, OS X), run
a free/open source one such as GNU/Linux or FreeBSD. This is not under
the control of the Tor Browser. It's not wise to trust proprietary
software with your anonymity. Many of the ?open questions? about what
is, or isn't, written to disk will be related to this point, and you
should take it seriously. You should assume that, given sufficient
incentive, Microsoft or Apple will implement any back door that Big
Brother desires. Again, this is not under the control of the Tor
If you feel you would be safer running in a VM and deleting the entire
VM afterwards, you are free to do so. This is not under the control of
the Tor Browser. Please note that in general deleting a file does not
remove its contents from the underlying storage immediately. The
standard technique to compensate for this is to overwrite the file
in-place at least once before deleting (and many authorities will tell
you that once is not enough). Note that if you're running a log
structured or versioning file system (unlikely, but you haven't said
that you're not) then this trick just won't work.
Related to the above, secure deletion is near impossible to ensure on
an SSD (flash based main storage, as found in some high end laptops
but also in netbooks, tablets etc). If this bothers you (and if you're
using the above technique, it probably does), don't use an SSD; use a
traditional hard disk. This is not under the control of the Tor Browser.
If after considering all of the above you are still feeling paranoid,
remove all the writeable storage from your computer and run entirely
from a live CD/DVD (*not* a USB key; if you don't trust TBB not to
write to your main storage, you shouldn't trust it not to write to
anything; similarly, you will want to use a write-once medium, i.e. not
CD/DVD?RW). This *does not have to be TAILS*. You can run many
GNU/Linux based OSes straight from their install DVDs (I recommend
Xubuntu for ease of use), install TBB into its ramdisk, and run from
there. The one TAILS feature you may miss is the cold-boot attack

If your computer has been physically compromised, then even these
precautions may not save you. Have you ever let it out of sight at
airport security? Been arrested while carrying it? Found an intruder in

discreetly installed some hardware which monitors what you're doing,
regardless of what's written to disk. This is not under the control of
the Tor Browser.
If all this is still too technical, then you may be putting yourself at
risk by using the Internet, ever. This really isn't something that the
Tor Browser, or any other software, can help with. If you're concerned
by your own lack of knowledge then book yourself into a computer
science course at your local college or university and take modules
related to operating systems, networks, security, cryptography and
semantics. Unfortunately this is an advanced field and declaring
yourself to be a ?noob? doesn't change that. By all means if you have
more questions then ask them, but some things need an understanding of
more fundamental concepts before they make sense.

In future I'd appreciate it if questions like this could go to the list
instead of to me personally. I don't mind sharing my thoughts with the
wider community, who can then either learn from them or criticise them
(which of course I learn from). But direct communication feels a bit
too much like consultation, and as this is my profession and I have
children to feed I don't really want to do it for free. This is why I'm
replying on-list.
If you want to run your own mail server, you need either to hire a VPS
or dedicated server, or colocate a machine of your own in a datacentre.
While in theory you could run a server off a cable or DSL line, I
wouldn't recommend it. Even if your ISP is friendly towards the idea
they're unlikely to guarantee you the uptime you need for a reliable
service. Never mind that it'll be your home the police are sniffing
around if you're doing anything illegal with it.
On the server you want to run a Unix-type system. GNU/Linux and FreeBSD
are the most popular options, though NetBSD is a good candidate too.
(OpenBSD has many advocates but I'm not personally a fan). You then
will need to configure an SMTP server. Postfix is included with many
distributions and is a reasonable choice. But whichever you choose,
configuring a mailserver is not trivial. One mistake you don't want to
make is to end up running an open relay, as it'll get you blacklisted
by the major providers pretty quickly.
To be able to receive mail to your server, you need one or more domains
that you can create DNS records for. For mail to foo at example.com to be
correctly routed, you need to add an MX record in example.com pointing
at your server. If you only have the one server, then you'll only need
one record, but if your server is down or unreachable then other
servers will probably either bounce or blackhole incoming mail. They're
under no obligation to queue it for you. So if you don't want that to
happen, you should consider running a backup server on a different
network (and add a lower priority MX record for it). Note that the need
for DNS records precludes foo at something.onion as a practical address
format. Your mail will have to be routed off-Tor.
Would I recommend it? No. Unless you want to do so for the learning
experience. SMTP is insecure by design; running your own server doesn't
do anything to prevent interception of messages, it merely gives you
another system to administer. For security purposes you will achieve
more by learning how to use GnuPG to encrypt your mail. You can use
this with any email provider, either with tools built into (or added
onto) your mail client, or using the standalone tools and C&P. It
doesn't solve every problem (e.g. mail headers are plaintext) but it
does mean that the body of encrypted messages is not revealed if
communication is intercepted, or the server is seized.

If your jurisdiction is .de (as per your address) then I can't comment
on that. But trust me as somebody who has banged his head against many
SMTP shaped walls (including such larks as persistent dictionary attacks
pushing loadavgs up to over 3000 - another problem you have to deal
with if you run your own server), this is the way things work in
reality, at least at some ISPs.
Email isn't a guaranteed delivery service. I've spent enough of my life
trying to drum that into people :( Whatever the rules in your own
jurisdiction, that doesn't affect the behaviour of servers elsewhere.
How long do you think they're obliged to queue it for? Eternity?
There's a dead simple DoS straight away. Sooner or later it'll be
dropped or bounced. If you don't have a backup MX (even if it just
queues it to pass onto your main one later), you will be losing mail at
some point.

Yes, there is that possibility. Which comes back to the bit about it
being inherently insecure. Even without a dynamic IP involved, a
misconfiguration of someone else's relay could mean your mail being
offered to practically anyone, in the clear.

It's easy enough to think of a situation where there's a third party
involved, e.g. if you have to use a particular address for work
purposes, and instead of providing you a POP box they redirect
(forward) it to your personal email (because employers can be awkward
like that). In this case, it's not the sender's fault, and you're not
in a position to fix it either.
And there's that can of worms again. The road to hell is paved with
misconfigured servers...
Indeed. I prefer IMAP over SSL but it's a matter of taste/priorities.
Providing a webmail interface gives a lower bar to entry, but makes
using GPG a bit of a faff.

i.e. you can't actually be sure of anything. Unless you control every
link from sender to your server, you should assume your message can
be (or even has been) intercepted. So your peers encrypt their
traffic to you; doesn't mean that traffic to them was encrypted,
nor does it mean that plaintext messages can't be plucked straight from
their queues. While you gain the possibility to control your own
storage, you don't control anything that any intermediaries (or
those watching your intermediaries) store. This massively limits your
advantage, while you have to deal with all the headaches that come with
running a mail server.
It worries me that this point isn't better understood. It's the same
faulty reasoning that leads to people wanting 1-hop Tor routes.
Control of your end and trusting the other end is not enough. Do you
gain something? Technically yes. Is it enough to phase your
adversaries? Almost certainly not. Having a fully anonymised mail
service would be of benefit, but just running your own server doesn't
even come close to providing adequate security, because SMTP *is
insecure by design*.

On Sun, 25 Nov 2012 23:34:30 +0100
What's your basis for ?my clock is running correctly?? It's going to be
hard for anybody to diagnose your problem with so little detail:
information like what OS you're running, your hardware configuration,
other things running on the machine that could be affecting performance
are all clues to the puzzle.
One clue though is that you say Tor was at 100%. Assuming this is a
Unix-like system, what's the loadavg when this happens? (Sorry, I don't
know how to retrieve an equivalent statistic on Windows.) If it's
greater than the number of CPU cores for any extended period you have
then your problem may simply be that your computer isn't powerful
enough to do what you're asking of it.
Consider this scenario: Tor is working its arse off handling too many
circuits and/or hidden services, maxing out your CPU. Of course, Tor
isn't the only process being scheduled: there are httpd processes
serving your hidden sites and possibly non-hidden ones, other daemons
such as sshd, ftpd, smbd etc, and of course anything you're doing
interactively on the console at the time. And if your CPU can't keep
up, maybe the filesystem can't either, causing processes to get stuck
while other processes are in IOwait. Throw in memory shortage and the
associated heavy swapping (= more disk IO, more CPU usage, more
scheduling delays) and you have a recipe for things spiralling out of
control. Conceivably there could be a significant time between Tor
being scheduled out and back in again. Multiply this by a few
scheduling cycles, and perhaps it could indeed look to Tor as though
the clock had jumped forwards.
Well, everything I wrote above is purely theoretical, but if you are
running 70 hidden services on an overloaded machine that obviously adds
a little more weight to the theory. Try reducing the load on your
machine (e.g. by switching off the hidden services and other running
daemons), or running the same services on a more powerful server, and
see if it makes the problem go away.

Hello Mike,

Thank you for contributing to this discussion!
As many Tor users are up against one or more government level
adversaries (a situation that Google is familiar with) I don't know how
realistic this option is. Your phone messages presumably have a
fixed format and can be logged by the network; drawing attention to Tor
usage is not the goal and I can see that being a serious problem.
This assumes that the user is able to reach Google without Tor at
all. But that aside, I'm sure you will appreciate that not clearing
cookies at all between non-Tor and Tor sessions is unacceptable to many
Tor users who intentionally use separate browser sessions for their
anonymised and non-anonymised access. The majority of users are not
computer scientists and will have difficulty identifying which
cookie(s) it is they are supposed to be preserving, let alone doing so
safely. I see a cookie called GAPS under accounts.google.com - is this
the only one which needs to persist for authentication to work?
I believe it would be very much appreciated if your team could provide a
support page with a walk-through for Tor users explaining how to gain
access by the second method, which would serve as the canonical guide
and can be updated if you change your requirements. I understand this
would take some effort, but as some users are undoubtedly paying
customers (e.g. NGOs with Google Apps accounts) I'm sure there is a
business case for it. As the official Tor Browser is based on Firefox
then most users would be covered if only this was documented.
NB. I'm not part of the Tor project, just a concerned user.

It's the difference between me (as a disabled person) buying a loaf of
bread from my neighbour, versus paying him to run to the shop for me.
It's an important distinction because at no point in the second case
does my neighbour own the bread. In terms of account creation, you're
paying somebody for the time & effort it takes them to set up an

@_subject: [tor-talk] Porn make the world more free: Tor Porn Bundle? 
A few things to consider (some practical, some political):
* It's possible to wank without porn. We can reach places in our
  imagination that no amount of ?reality? can take us. In my experience
  an orgasm that starts in the mind is *much* more fulfilling than
  one involving porn. It's also possible to reach orgasm without wanking
  (i.e. by having sex). I'd rather work towards full sexual liberation
  than encouraging people to continue seeing sex as a base instinct best
  satisfied by masturbation.
* While there's nothing at all wrong with pictures and videos of
  people having sex (hell, I like them) it is an undisputed (AFAIK)
  fact that the sex industry (including porn) is an exploitative one,
  especially of women. Getting into bed with the porn producers risks
  alienating the feminist movement who would otherwise be naturally
  aligned with Tor's goals.
* The term ?Tor Porn Bundle? would undoubtedly have the word ?Child?
  inserted in some people's minds. While others on this list have made
  it clear that they disagree with me, personally I believe this is a
  bad thing and would harm the project.
* I fear that the mere presence of such a TPB on a person's computer
  would be construed as evidence of lawbreaking and lead to arrests and
  everything bad that follows that. The beauty of the generic TBB is
  that all its presence implies is that you value anonymity. It gives
  no clue as to *why* you do.
* As others have pointed out, if you're thinking in terms of
  facilitating Flash videos, you are setting yourself up for a security
  nightmare. If you want to build a secure Flash player from the ground
  up then that may be a worthwhile project, but I'm not sure that it's a
  realistic one. HTML5 video is already viewable over Tor.
* Have you ever actually tried visiting a porn site over Tor? It's
  painful, or at least it was when I tested it a while back. The
  bandwidth requirements for thumbnail sites in particular are quite
  high and I'm not sure the network can handle it (yet).
* More so than any other resource I've seen, porn sites bombard the user
  with requests and incentives to provide credit card information. You
  talk about targeting teenagers. This worries me. Aside from the
  wider moral debate over children and sex, this is a group who have
  limited experience of the world and are likely to na?vely trust Tor
  to protect them from harm no matter what they do. Once you
  steal your parents' credit card details and use them over
  Tor you've lost. Ethically, are we right to assume we can educate
  them sufficiently at a distance? Imagine copies of Tor being passed
  around on USB sticks by 12 year olds in a classroom, saying ?this
  will let you see porn? with no explanation of the risks. This makes
  me deeply uncomfortable.
* Due to the prevalence of anti-porn legislation, making supporting the
  porn industry a direct goal of the project may put exit node
  operators at an increased risk and be off-putting for people
  considering setting up a relay, *especially* if the goal is to allow
  minors access to sexual content. It already takes serious balls to
  run an exit.

What you're trying to do is illogical. Normally, your local system
resolves localhost to 127.0.0.1 which is the ?loopback? address to talk
to itself. Over Tor this is meaningless, as your exit node isn't on
your local machine. If you want to test a Tor connection to your server

It looks like it refers to the encoding method, i.e. hexadecimal vs
base64 - compare lines 1028 and 1033.

Out of interest, if you were ?forced? to help, what help do you believe
you could provide?

As none of the devs have answered... Yes, that's how I read the code.

It occurred to me earlier that a funkier solution would be to use a GPS
receiver. Possibly overkill for your simple access point configuration,
but if you have a cluster of RPis then one could receive the clock
signal and the rest pick it up by ntp. No relying on either a battery
or a public ntpd.
