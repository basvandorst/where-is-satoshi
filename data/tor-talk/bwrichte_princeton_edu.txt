@_subject: [tor-talk] Setting up Custom Circuit for Testing 
Hey Everyone,
So we are trying to test some modifications we made to TOR on Emulab, but in
order to do so we need to be able to build the TOR circuit specifically
through the Emulab nodes we set up.  How we would go about doing something
like this? Bryan and Shawn
