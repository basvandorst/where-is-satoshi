As far as i know this would be a bad idea, but i can't exactly cite the
reasons from my head;
it is probalby contained in the section about what else you have to do
to stay anonymous

If this is the Setting, I THINK Whonix has their VM build with TBB as
Standard Browser
Yes but the biggest Problem are Malicious Gateways that may try to
steal Credentials or put Malware in you Downloads
IMHO the best way to legitimate the Tor network would be to provide and
use HS ( which are much less prone to the previous mentioned Problem
AFAIK ).

not exactly; i for example  would love to run a few local clearnet
services as a worldwide torservice, and i don't need to stay anonym.
and one could argue that you help your users avoid bad exits, because
they don't need a real exit node AFAIK.
