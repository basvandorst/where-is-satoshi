Are you smarter? I know I'm not. I don't do that. That should make me
any better? Maybe they are doing something far better that I don't do.
Think about it.
So why are there so many government employees? Just to suck the money
out of social security?
Having a pervert looking at exit traffic is already a disgrace. What can
be worse?
Not if you understand how the software goes. But hey, homeopathy works
in at least 1% of the cases, right? So does prayer. A few years ago a
dead Theresa of Calcutta cured of cancer a woman that was operated and
was doing chemotherapy.
Rephrased, small people using big words usually are too swamped in their
useless buy habits. The so called normal people want a second mortgage
for a larger home. Helping a project like Tor makes me wonder why do
people citicize so much the US of A. A woman like Ayaan Hirsi Ali is
alive because of the Dutch government and their police. A man like
Salman Rushdie can enrich the World's culture because of UK lawmakers.
The nice, clean, reliable, well fed man would speed up when he realizes
there is rape going on nearby.
Let Tor grow your way and it would make Google and Microsoft combined
look like a newborn.

Sorry, could not help myself. But just try some other shoes. ?I support

Bill Cox:
Who makes the law? Law abiding means good?
Maybe the problem is the lack of software. Incompetent design is usually
the issue. Yet people need someone to lynch.
Hitler gets mentioned often when flames start, but his reign of terror
is far better documented than Stalin or Mao. Because the German
politicians dragged the people into a very distructive war, somebody had
to pay. The winners of that war applied the same reasoning as yourself.
Which amplified the problems. The Germans felt bad about their
sittuation. And somebody had to be guilty. It's hard to point the finger
at oneself. So a minority was demonised as the source of all evil and
not the lack of education and the political indifference. So a Holocaust
was born.
See above. Own incompetence is good enough to punish somebody else? Sure!
You want your freedom. Nobody other's. Don't kid yourself. This does not
mean you are obliged to think this way. Just try.
A rapist seems to thing precisely the same thing when someone
interferes. Sure, when thinking about self, one can be so much ethicaly
higher than another human.
That is precisely what Tor offers right now.
But I can bet you would be displeased if that person happens to knock at
your door some day to give you a piece of his mind.
STASI guys used to do the same thing. Somehow white middle class
christians had the impression that was bad. But those guys were just
paying the rent and bills. At least most of them.
Sometimes I wonder who is more perverted, the porn obsessed or the
voyeur watching that one through the window.
So, in the end, history's monsters were just people like others. Reading
this I sense that there are far worse individuals who just can't catch
enough power to do what they would like to do.

No offense, You reasoning sucks. Google did the Android. They are
nowhere close to ?just some random commercial company without any
reputation?. Step aside from the media
you are consuming. Give it a few months to cool. If you can trust me:
nothing important is going to happen even if you miss 10 years. Myself I
missed close to 10 and I feel like a century won't be enough. What the
media is calling shocking with NSA was done before by STASI. Than KGB
before them. NKVD before that. And so on a few millennia. Adolf Hitler
had two extra features over Alexander the Great and Muhhamad the crazy
prophet that is so ugly nobody wants to pain. One was the closeness. AH
is so much closer to us than the others. But still, if you get close to
white power groups you can see the hagiography coming to life. Second
was the technological advance. That same magic makes NSA so impressive.
Still no sign of the excesses of their homologues in Eastern Europe.
Some times I think what kind of morons CIA and the gang are employing. I

Hello list
I am currently negociating to publish an article, the first of a few. It
is about someone with political power in some Easter Europe country. The
magazine does not want a creative common article as they do not want other
publications to copy it. Meaning I have to be paid. Now, I know there are
enough people to have access to the list of payments, people paid bad
enough to be easily corrupted. I am living abroad. Still, I do not want my
relatives to suffer because of my articles. Is there a way the magazine
can make the payment and the people working in Accountancy won't know the

browsing in the TBB?
4. Can I insure a new path for each account checked?

about yahoo not seeing two yahoo connections from the same IP at the

Now I'm getting somewhere.
Yes, but I have no idea what the server is seeing from me. So I was
hoping for somebody who already went through this to share info. The
couple I have tried so far do not even use HTTPS for the control panel.
I searched for ssh support and it is a web console that simulates ssh in
the browser. FTP so far is plain and open. And to make things nicer,
they do email me the account and password.
But when most people ask the answers are like this. How's ?properly
configured?? How do I know it is properly configured?
The wiki is quite messy. And you have old stuff and new stuff. None is
dated so the new stuff can be old as well.
I fully agree with you: complex apps are simply complex. I want basic
tools and for that I am ready to pass the GUI and go for the shell. But
how do I test for leaks?
Please understand, I have nothing against you: on the contrary, you are
the only one who answered me. But the whole thing is a mess. A year or
so I asked the Tails guys why doesn't my USB installed from VirtualBox
doesn't work. They were rather cold and the main guy said something
along the lines: it's not free and we don't support it. Yes, the USB
part of VirtualBox is not supported. Whonix needs it. And it's a 3Gb
