@_subject: [tor-talk] Privacy Badger 
Since Privacy Badger uses a learning heuristic based on the sites you
visit, it actually might possible for it to leak information about your
browsing history too.
In general, does Tor Browser persist the state saved by extensions
across restarts, or is that wiped along with the history and cookies and
everything else?
