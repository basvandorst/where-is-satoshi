@_subject: connection to server failed 
I already sent a question, it seems that no one known any solution. I get the message from tor and ethereal, that a connection was made (SYN) and instantly closed again (RST). Does anyone know something about it? There was a similar problem in an old version of tor but fixed (I read on the list).
Thanks again.

I'm Klaus and this is my first post to this list. I already searched through google and the or-talk archive but found only a quite old article which doesn't help me.
What can I do to get tor running again on my local machine?
I use the gentoo ebuild of tor since Oct 2004 and worked fine since I opened some ports from the firewall (9001-9003 and 9030-9033). Now I use version 0.0.9.2 and having troubles connecting to a server (see log below). Ports 9001-9033 (TCP/UDP) are right now open besides the usual 80,20,21,22,148,...
With Ethereal I can see that a SYN is made to a server and the server responds with a RST. So it does not
accept the connection anymore.
A directory is obviously be loaded since ~.tor/cached-directory is created and filled after deletion.
My question is: why? I have another server without any firewall connected directly to the internet and tor works great there. So I use privoxy localy connecting to port 9050 local which is a ssh tunnel to tor on the remote server. This is not a good thing because the servers purpose is not to have tor running :-)
The settings for FascistFirewall doen't have any affect, since the recomended ports are open:
FascistFirewall 1
FirewallPorts 80,22,9001,9002,9003,9004,9030,9031,9032,9033
Thanks a lot!
