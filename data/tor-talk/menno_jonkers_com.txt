Thunderbird does work with nntp over Tor when it has Tor set as its socks proxy (skipping Privoxy). Naturally the news server you're contacting needs to allow connects from 'wherever'.

Hash: SHA1
I'm experiencing the same problem. The pattern is that things usually
work fine, but once in a while it's just all 404s for a while (say 5-30
minutes). I haven't looked into it, but my uneducated guess would be
that an exit node is causing it.
It made me wonder if adding a Tor server that willingly provides a
corrupt DNS would be an effective way to frustrate use of Tor.
