Depends on what ISP you have, but also other factors such as connectivity
to the bw auths and such

Thanks in advance.

I did get emails from tor weather when I signed up, but haven't got any
shirt mails.

Thanks. I've just tried signing up again. Will I still receive the email
even if it has already earned the shirt?

That's a lot of trouble to go through, and the translations are not always
correct - i.e. sometimes, something will get translated from one language
-> another language -> original language - and the meaning will sometimes
be different...

I also wanted my 3rd node online, but seems I'm having a bit of trouble
connecting to authorities there... Will have to look at it when getting
back from holiday...

I've over some time ran some different tor relays - and I really like the
Tor project. It really makes sense to me.
Here is the problem I've ran into. On my exit node, speedybacon2500, I have
2.5 Gbit/s interface and 8 CPU cores. Tor uses ~60 mbps and 1 CPU core. I
do also have a few other things running on the server, but I'd really like
to be able to take advantage of more CPU cores and more bandwidth.

I am aware of MyFamily, but I've primarily not set it because most of the
relays are temporary, so I'll keep the speedybacon2500 around but the
others will run out on July, 1st. I was too lazy to set them for this short
period of time.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Directory problems? 
I'm running 4 tor relays and have got the following error on all the relays:
[WARN] Received http status code 404 ("Consensus not signed by sufficient
number of requested authorities") from server '154.35.175.225:80' while
fetching consensus directory.
It's different severs that it tries to get it from, and it's different
servers that try to get it. It happened today...
Anyone have any idea?
Before I wrote here, I Googled it and found a ticket, but seems to have
been 18 months ago it was closed and set to resolved but without the steps
to resolve it.

I received the same kind of errors on my 4 relays and wrote to this list

@_subject: [tor-talk] Extend auto-IP-switching-time in TorBrowser (and 
Why? Tor automatically chooses a pool of entry guards for 4 or 8 weeks, and
every 10 minutes a new path is made through the network as far as I know.
And doing it in this way is one of the reasons it is more safe to use tor.
Because even if someone have set up an exit node and that exit node watches
the traffic, he can't really use it for anything because he only gets some
of the packets from that browsing session meaning that he might see
something, but at most 10 minutes worth of activity.
