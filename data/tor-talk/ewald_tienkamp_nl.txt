Obviously this has to do with CAcert certificates not being shipped by
default with most browsers and torrent clients. You may want to check
 for more info on CAcert. I think using CAcert for SSL
should be fine, though you may want to refer people of the proper CAcert
root certificates on the front page or something like that.
Aside from this, I second some of the sentiments expressed by people
before me: polling RSS to see whether a new torrent is available is not
going to improve the number of seeds, and I had to click many times
before I finally got to the page with the actual torrents. Also, yes,
the RSS feed seems to be non-existent.

Indeed this is way better. Also, I apologize for the email I sent
earlier: due to a problem with my hosting provider I missed out on some
emails that were sent before mine.
