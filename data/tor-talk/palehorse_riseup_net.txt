I asked the help desk about this first but I am afraid it has only added
to my confusion. I would like to use the Tor broswer along with the tor
and tor-arm packages from the Debian repo.  In the past it has been
possible to do so by disabling the tor-launcher in the start-tor-broswer
script, but this no longer works.  In addition, according to the help
desk "without tor-launcher you probably now have a unique set of browser
add-ons among all Tor users."  Can someone please explain to me what the
base tor package has to do with Firefox add-ons and how this would be
different between debian and the bundle?  I was under the impression
that the broswer handled these concerns, hence the whole point of using
a special browser for Tor?  Also, isn't it hypocritical to suggest users
run a tor relay from the debian package while using the TBB for browsing
alongside as well?  I seem to recall the project frowning upon Tor over
Tor situations in the past, but perhaps this has changed.  Sorry for all
of the questions, thank you and happy holidays.

thank you for the response lunar.  The skip command will indeed open the
browser but it doesn't play nicely with about:tor or the torbutton, so I
am no longer comfortable with this.
bundled Tor instance?
This release is drastically different from the previous Vidalia bundled
ones.  In the past I have always found running both monitors together to
be overkill and unnecessarily taxing on my aging desktop relay.
However, since manually killing Vidalia is no longer a concern I would
agree that there seems to be no benefit to this approach.  Also, I have
been using the apt repo for so long now I never learned that arm
command, so thank you for that!
