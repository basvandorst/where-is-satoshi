I installed  obfs proxy [tor-pluggable-transports-browser-
2.4.11-alpha-2_en-US.exe] from
While launching this Tor obfs proxy  browser, I am getting
high light to upgrade this browser  with latest Tor browser bundle *2.3.25-6.
Is it necessary to upgrade the latest Tor browser bundle
on top of Obfsproxy exe?
If so again the traffic from upgraded browswer will
get detect by DPI censorship?

I tried  Trasparent proying of Orbot  as  mentioned
*APPS*  and observed all web (traffic built-in Browser, Gmail, YouTube,
Maps and any other application
that uses standard web traffic)and all DNS requests from my Android mobile
are not following  Tor
        Observed with wireshark and above mentioned application traffics
are having DNS request and DNS
response packets  and followed by large number of HTTP packets.
         My Mobile is running on Android 2.2  Kernel which is already root
and I also gave super user
permission for Tor installation.
         what is possibe  issue here?
