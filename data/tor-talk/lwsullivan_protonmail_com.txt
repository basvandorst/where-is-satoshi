@_subject: [tor-talk]  Snowflake vs China 
I wouldn't underestimate the capabilities of a state-level actor in a totalitarian regime. The CCP has spent 15 years tightening the GFW and all the signs are they mean to continue.
Does anyone know if there are any metrics of Snowflake users and bridges by which we could quantify the size of the "churn"? I get the impression that Snowflake adoption isn't very widespread.
There are alternative avenues out there. Ticket  describes a project to promote private obfs4 bridges to NGOs. A recent article on Medium about using Tor in China claimed that the Chinese themselves prefer proxies to bridges.
