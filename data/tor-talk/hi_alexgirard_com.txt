@_subject: [tor-talk] Following best-practices for tor exit-node on RIPE 
Hi all,
I'm trying to open a new tor exit node on tetaneutral.net - associative ISP in Toulouse, France - and I've got a question after reading the best-practices available on this page: On point 5, it describe how to change the contact email on an IP.
Tetaneutral has a range of IP, and we can use 1 IP for the tor exit node. The description about the contact mail concerns ARIN, does someone know how to do it on RIPE?
Thanks a lot,
