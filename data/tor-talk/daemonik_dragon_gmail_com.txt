This sounds extremely rude to me as someone who values privacy. I would no
more like someone surveiling the times and routes I take to work than I
would someone doing the same to my IP packets. Yeah maybe they can't see
what is in it... but if they can look at the beginning and endpoints, then
where it goes in between is hardly relevant. There goes the privacy just
the same.

Heh, I was trying to be facetious... :)
But yeah, it is painfully slow without having torrent swarms milling about in the tor network as well...
Of course, I honestly don't know how you could use tor for bittorrent... the xfer speed must be abysmal! Eww.
If you must proxy your P2P connections, try the aliveproxy list

Yeah, except doesn't that kinda go against the principal of the network? It's only bad right now because tor is new and not able to shoulder the responsibility of hosting a lot of P2P connections.. doesn't mean it will always be that way.
Just a thought :)

Oh, and I forgot... It is totally possible to close the exit nodes to most P2P networks... however that is up to the opers individually, so unless there is some global agreement, then I don't think it will happen that way.

Well, since I don't pay for bandwidth, but just the connection (I'm one of
the useless 20KB servers way down on the list) it's just the same either
way for me. But I still feel like it is a cause worth supporting, and this
is the only way I know how. I wish to give people the freedom to access
information they want, without fear of being marked or asked to rectify
their reasons for needing the information. Information, knowledge, should
be free for humans to use, to help them understand and learn. And I think
tor has brought a lot of people the freedom to do this, where it was not
possible before. It can protect people trying to do the right thing
(whistleblowers), it can expose people to new ideas that their government
tries to suppress (i.e. China), and just give us an overall sense of
liberation by not being tied to a numerical address that defines our every
That is my intention.
Sorry, didn't mean to preach information liberation to everyone... It's
just kind of a personal thing for me. =D

Did you open ports 9030 and 9001 TCP in your firewall, or forward them from your NAT?
Looks like tor is not able to access itself from outside of your computer... I'd check that first.

Has anyone ever tried using a program like ProxyCap for tunneling things like MSN Chat through tor?
I had some limited success with it, but ProxyCap seems to be buggy at best, and does things like make all internet applications unable to access the internet, even if they aren't in ProxyCap's rules.
Also, it isn't free, and I hate paying for software that doesn't work.

Yes! That worked. There was a copy of it still resident even though it

Coolness, ty.
Well, I added a win2k version of TorDNS to the website. The problem might
be also that you have a version of TorDNS already running in memory
(somwhow), press CTRL-ALT-DELETE and stop any process that has TorDNS in
it..... Then try again... If not, the problem might be that you can not use
127.0.0.1 as a DNS server. If so, use the win2k version. Please let me know
how it works.

Is tor just a fast way to bounce connections for crackers?

Well, I certainly hope that it doesn't come to interfere in our basic
rights. Even the great P2P networks of yore could not be shut down
completely, so I'm sure tor will survive any such attempt to decapitate it.
But suppose that "tor" does become synonymous with "hacker," how will that
limit the uses of tor in the future?

Ok, so we should place rules of some kind...
So who should police these rules and how should they be impemented?
Many people have different configurations so the rules may be different for
each person.
So we should perhaps rely on ourselves to impose our own rules? But then,
will that cause outsiders to look upon tor as unregulated and therefore

It would be worth noting also that MSN Chat runs on 6667 as it uses an
implementation of the ircx protocol as well. Take that as you will, but
coming from someone who writes amateur irc bots for MSN, it is just as bad
on the abuse level as other IRC channels, only more popular.
