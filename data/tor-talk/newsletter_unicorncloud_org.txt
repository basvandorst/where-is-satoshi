@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor RPM? 
I want to move my Tor Node from Debian to Fedora. The guide tells me to
install the normal packages from the Fedora Repositories
( Although, using Fedora
24, I only get Tor 0.2.8.8-1, and on Debian I was always using
deb.torproject.org to get the latest alpha version of Tor.
Is there any way to archive this on Fedora without building Tor from source?
All the best
