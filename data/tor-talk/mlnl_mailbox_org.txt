@_subject: [tor-talk] [tor-relays] anonymous file storage was "freehaven 
I have used the Aktie application
 and Tahoe-LAFS with I2P for
filesharing some time and both worked fine. Something like that or OFS
or an distributed, "global OnionShare" (not only friend-to-friend),
povided over a Tor Onion Service client, would be imo fine to store,
share or online-backup files. Or is a more centralized anonymous data
(cloud) haven meant to store files permanently?
