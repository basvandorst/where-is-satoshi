@_subject: [tor-talk] Receiving money under a protected identity 
Receive payment via bitcoin. You still run a risk of some identification
when(/if) you attempt to transfer BTC to fiat currency via a traditional
method (eg BTC Exchange wiring to a Bank Acct). There are always ways to
exchange BTC for cash without records kept (think localbitcoins).
Hopes this helps.
