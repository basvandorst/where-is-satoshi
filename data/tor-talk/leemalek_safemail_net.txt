@_subject: [tor-talk] New Tor project idea for internet comments 
Hi, I am new here.
I have an idea for a tor sub-project that would serve our purpose (fighting censorship) perfectly.
This would be a different version of tor - a sort of sub-tor... and a browser plugin.
Everyone that installs this version of tor would be forced to run a relay - but only for comments - no images, etc.
The browser plugin would connect to the tor app and scan the webpage the person is on. The plugin would display on a drop down comments people have made using the tor comments system. They can of couse make comments of their own.
I think this is a must for our purpose. So many news website block comments they dont like these days.
If I had the programming skills I would get started on this. But I don't. So I'm hoping this post gets the ball rolling. With this kind of system plus using the tor website to market it, we could really change the dialog in this and every country.

This has nothing to do with people censoring tor users and everything to do with normal blogs censoring normal users because they don't like their comments. I am thinking mainly of the USA here. This will be a problem as time progresses.
This allows sharing of information directly on news sites, safely and anonymously, completely circumventing their censoring of other political views. How is this not the place for something like this?

99% of censorship happens on blog comments. This kind of project would help to force an open dialog.
If we aren't going on the offensive against censorship we will lose eventually. The power is in the hands of those who control the message. And those who control the media control the message. This would allow us to break through the shit and get a counter-message out right on their own websites.
There is a way to accomplish this.
Also, we need to start thinking about message control, not just governments blocking certain sites. The elites fear the internet and anonymity because of the possibility of losing control of the message/ the dialog ,whatever you want to call it.
Putting the message in the hands of the people is the best thing that could ever happen for US and the worst thing for them.

The traffic could be distinct because the system would be a duplicate. Almost like a tor light edition. People would be far more willing to host relays when you only allow comments and not images...
If I had the money I would gladly pay for this myself. That's how important it is.
In fact I considered creating a normal browser plugin to accomplish this... but the need for a server to hold all of the comments would be a centralized attack target.
So this would decentralize things.... and come to think of it this would have to include decentralization freenet style. So it would take some work, but it would be worth it.
