@_subject: Exclude... options and what about Tor v multi-hop proxies? 
Would the designers/developers please extend the comparison FAQs [1][2] to include commercial multi-hop providers, like perfect-
privacy.com, xerobank.com, built on top of Tor, or otherwise? In the manual I see Exclude[Exit]Nodes options but just two routers marked as bad at [3]. I find this somehow implausible, no offence intended. Is there a more comprehensive list of routers that should be listed with that option? Thank you.
[1] [2] [3] p.s. please populate the info command for or-talk mailing list.

With 25+ perfect-privacy routers in the network? I would say they are built on top of the Tor. They don't all declare the family option either but that is another matter.
I would gladly if I knew enough about it, and I will if this thread produces a reasonable reply. As a user I read the designer/developer provided documentation trying to understand the system and trust their judgment/word when it gets too deep for me to understand it. Not all of your users are academics with PhDs.  Every other configuration is there in the FAQ, compared with Tor, so I don't understand why these type of services are excluded from the comparison. I did not post the question here as soon as it occurred to me. I have spent considerable time reading around, including the entire or-xxx archives to find such a comparison but found nothing except (elsewhere) unproven claims and counter-claims from users or haters of such systems.
