Hi Nathan...one last thing..when I am on my data service my phone co sends
my internet traffic through a web proxy.  I believe this is why Orbit may
be having issues...any thoughts?

Not sure but my carrier connects me through a WAP server.  Whenever I am
off WiFi with orbot none of my apps or browsers can connect to the internet.

Yes I did confirm in the APN I connect through wap.davewireless.com.    Is
there any setting I can configure in so that when I am off WiFi I can still
route my internet data through Orbot?

Hi I have a strange Orbot issue that has puzzled me for some weeks. Orbot
while on my wifi network works with most of my apps. But when I am off my
wifi network (on my mobile data) my browser and apps (facebook, Pandora,
internet browsing) on my Galaxy Nexus.  It will not connect to the
internet. Once I turn off Orbot apps and browsers work again (however I am
no longer using tor VPN and since I am outside of the U.S. Pandora won't
work. Is there a setting I'm missing? Tor works for me with most of my apps
on WiFi only (other than Radio.com or iHeart Radio...still trying to figure
that out)  ?!?!
  I currently have Orbot configured for;  Tranparent Proxyfing, Tor
Everything, Entrance/Exit Nodes {US}, Use Default Iptables.
Any help much appreciated.

Hi Nathan, I believe I am using the most up to date version.

Is this the most up to date version?  Are there any additional settings I
should consider?

Hi Nathan,
I am using Transparent proxying for all apps. The only firewall type app i
can think of is Lookout (but I believe my issue of not connecting while off
wifi was occurring before I installed).  Other than that I don't have any
other app installed that would act as a firewall.
Btw, I have cleared the cashe and data.  This did not clear up issue
