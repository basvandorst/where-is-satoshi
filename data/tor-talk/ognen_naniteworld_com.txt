Please stop abusing everyone on this list. You have made it impossible for us to follow it by turning it into everything but "tor". You should be banned from posting so you can go elsewhere and find someone else you can pour your psycho babble on.

@_subject: Commercial tor offering? 
I am sure someone had digested this before but what would be some issues with purchasing (say) twenty different boxes around the USA with good pipes and allowing people to use them as tor relays/exit nodes (while charging a monthly fee for it)? The way I see it, greatest obstacle to using tor every day is speed, but I might be wrong.
P.S. My apologies if this emails is duplicated, I had some emailer issues.

Thanks. You could still use the free infrastructure if you chose to do so. This would be an extra offering for people who want both anonymity and speed for a fee. Thanks for replying, it is not my intention to defend such an idea, just to see if it has been entertained before and if so, what was the conclusion.

I think peer review exists in science (and technology) for a purpose. If there is only one analyst, maybe your claim holds. However, results in general need to be testable and reproducible by anyone, so that everyone can convince themselves in the validity of claims being made. Anyways, this is just my philosophical remark, it is not the main interest of why I asked the original This is, however, much more interesting to me. You seem to imply that a company in one jurisdiction owns/operates nodes in another jurisdiction. Am I understanding this correctly?

@_subject: Work on tor 
Are there any small items to work on in Tor? I am looking to get into helping with the development and feel like fixing bugs or adding a small feature here or there would be the way to go. Any suggestions?
