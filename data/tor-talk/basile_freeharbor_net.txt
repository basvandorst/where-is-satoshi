@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor-ramdisk 20170130 released 
Hi everyone,
I want to announce that a new release of tor-ramdisk is out. Tor-ramdisk
is a uClibc-based micro Linux distribution whose only purpose is to host
a Tor server in an environment that maximizes security and privacy.
Security is enhanced by hardening the kernel and binaries, and privacy
is enhanced by forcing logging to be off at all levels so that even the
Tor operator only has access to minimal information. Finally, since
everything runs in ephemeral memory, no information survives a reboot,
except for the Tor configuration file and the private RSA key, which may
be exported/imported by FTP or SCP.
The following were updated: tor-0.2.9.9, busybox-1.26.2, openssh-7.4_p1,
linux-4.8.17 +
