Opennet, interesting site.  Most especially the part where I learned
that a Turkish prosecutor seeks to identify a youtube poster.   Had
this video been posted via Tor, the prosecutor will be unsuccessful.
Censorship of opinions suck.

What operating system, and is vidalia successfully communicating with
one instance or the other when you are *not* prompted for the pass?

It might do in the bug system yes, but I'm not actually sure if it
goes into trac or flyspray actually.  I wanted to help localize it
first.  Actually, I thought you were running two tor processes at the
same time, and I was wondering which one it connected?

attitude could change.
Your attitude I think is correct.  I mean to say, yes, your intent for
your relay is for censorship frustration, not games, movies, et
cetera.  I think your implementation is correct also.  I run a relay
without any exit permitted.  The only reason I do this, is because I
do not want to deal with any complaints ranging from DMCA, hacking,
child exploitation transiting my link.  If I ever decide to permit
exiting, it will be on a dedicated server that I would pay for,
located elsewhere.  I just wish there were a better way to inspect the
traffic and disallow certain traffic.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not
advocating that any relay inspect any traffic, just that illegal
traffic transiting outside my link could land me in trouble.  Perhaps

Seems the way to guard against this is to reconfigure the DNS lookup
to execute via tor at a system level.  Easily done with the network
configuration tools of Windows and Linux flavors.

"...DMCA, hacking, child exploitation transiting my link."
Don't get the context wrong... quote it all if your going to pick it
line item. These things (with perhaps the loose exception of DMCA) are
illegal in all jurisdictions I believe? If there were a way to balance
anonymity and frustrating censorship, along with frustrating child porn
proliferation and hacking... yes, I think I would be able to go with it.

Incidentally, I'll note that on the azureuswiki...
there is encouragement to use Tor for BitTorrent.  Personally, the
practice should be discouraged... and before anyone calls me pro

I have a mini spec prop regarding Tor and Torrent that I'll propose
once I have it worded correctly.

At dr|z3d's (on  IRC) suggestion, I have decided to donate some
space and a domain name for the purposes of a forum that can be used.
I don't expect this domain or hosting plan to go anywhere... anytime
soon.  What are the thoughts here of trialling a forum?

Some talking points generated from * Design proposals go to or-dev and not the forum.  There should be no
channel (subforum) for that.
* A conspiracy subforum would in all likelihood be undesirable.
* We should start out with a very small number of subforums.
*The forum is unofficial.  This can be revisited with the board at a
much later time if this venture is successful.
I've installed the php board and will update the scheme changes.
There is a volunteer drafting the posting guidelines, and I'm drafting
the privacy policy.  Input is welcome, as always.

Is there more information you could give.  For example, are you saying
that the nodes you are connected to are not in your network viewer list?

I had a thought.  Now we know that
1) Bittorrent traffic across the network is not preferable.
2) Bittorrent traffic does transit the network.
3) Currently, any protocol level filtering within Tor is not preferable.
We also know that some of the major developers of the bittorrent
platforms have coded some blocklist ip filtering for the actual
bittorrent platforms.
Have we thought of engaging the bittorrent community on blocking the
tor nodes themselves.  This would disrupt the BT traffic transiting
the Tor network.
